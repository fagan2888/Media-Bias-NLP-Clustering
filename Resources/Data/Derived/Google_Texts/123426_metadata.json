However, on Wednesday a bill was introduced that could change that.\n\nThis week, State Senator Liz Krueger of Manhattan introduced a bill to amend the current insurance law to add pregnancy to New York\u2019s list of qualifying events. As it currently stands getting married or divorced, becoming a citizen, getting released from prison, or even permanently moving outside of one\u2019s plan coverage area all qualify individuals for a special enrollment period for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act, but getting pregnant does not.\n\nAlong with State Senator Krueger Assembly Member Aravella Simotas and New York City Comptroller Scott M. Stringer are also urging passage for the bill. Last month the Comptroller released a report, \u201c Time to Deliver: Pregnancy and the Affordable Care Act, \u201d highlighting the risks facing pregnant women who cannot access prenatal care coverage outside of the official healthcare enrollment period. The report findings show a significant shortcoming in federal law regarding access to health care for a specific subgroup of the population.\n\n\u201cFrom birth control without co-pays to free preventative reproductive health care, the ACA has dramatically improved women\u2019s health across the country. However, the law fails to provide a way for uninsured women who become pregnant to secure quality, affordable prenatal care,\u201d Stringer told msnbc.com. \u201cWith the introduction of legislation, New York will be the first state in the nation to give women the opportunity to secure coverage when they get pregnant\u2014strengthening public health, protecting the financial stability of New Yorkers, and ensuring equal access for all.\u201d\n\nHealth care for pregnant women increases significantly during pregnancy and it is important that women be able to access the proper health care necessary for the betterment of themselves and their developing child.\n\nWomen who receive late or no prenatal care are three times more likely to give birth to a low-weight baby, and their baby is five times more likely to die\n\nInsurance companies are arguing that healthy women then would not purchase coverage and wait until they are pregnant. However the women who would be affected by this bill are those who do not qualify for Medicaid due to their income level yet do not receive enough coverage through their employers .\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen women don\u2019t have health insurance, they\u2019re more likely to have problem pregnancies, increased health care costs both for themselves and the infant. If it\u2019s born early, if it\u2019s born underweight, with good prenatal care, you can avoid all of these health care problems that are much more expensive than allowing women to join health insurance when they\u2019re pregnant,\u201d says.\n\nKrueger says.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "On Wednesday, a bill was introduced to amend the current insurance law to add pregnancy to New York's list of qualifying events.", "original-source": "http://www.msnbc.com/the-cycle/push-the-right-direction-get-women-insurance-coverage", "og": {"site_name": "MSNBC", "description": "On Wednesday, a bill was introduced to amend the current insurance law to add pregnancy to New York's list of qualifying events.", "title": "A push in the right direction to get women insurance coverage", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/the-cycle/push-the-right-direction-get-women-insurance-coverage", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/articles/103252794.jpg?itok=bVrdrH0P", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "msnbc.com", "account_id": 2836421, "creator": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/the-cycle/push-the-right-direction-get-women-insurance-coverage", "image": {"width": 830, "identifier": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--3-2--512x342/public/articles/103252794.jpg?itok=IAPc_BDs", "height": 553}, "title": "A push in the right direction to get women insurance coverage", "site": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "On Wednesday, a bill was introduced to amend the current insurance law to add pregnancy to New York's list of qualifying events."}, "robots": "follow, index", "DC.date.issued": "2015-04-03T17:08:51-04:00", "jenga-session-config": "{\"when_to_init\":\"after_dom_ready\"}", "fb": {"app_id": 351594351545594}, "nv": {"author": "traci-oshiro", "tags": "equality,health,health-care,women,the-cycle", "title": "A push in the right direction to get women insurance coverage", "published": 1, "date": "04/03/2015 17:08:51 EDT", "address": "http://www.msnbc.com/the-cycle/push-the-right-direction-get-women-insurance-coverage"}, "article": {"author": "http://www.facebook.com/msnbc"}, "abstract": "On Wednesday, a bill was introduced to amend the current insurance law to add pregnancy to New York's list of qualifying events.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Equality, Women, Health, Health Care"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3f74\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWhen women don\u2019t have health insurance, they\u2019re more likely to have problem pregnancies, increased health care costs both for themselves and the infant.\n\u201cFrom birth control without co-pays to free preventative reproductive health care, the ACA has dramatically improved women\u2019s health across the country.\nApparently, former convicts have a better chance of getting insured over pregnant women.\nLast month the Comptroller released a report, \u201c Time to Deliver: Pregnancy and the Affordable Care Act, \u201d highlighting the risks facing pregnant women who cannot access prenatal care coverage outside of the official healthcare enrollment period.\nThe report findings show a significant shortcoming in federal law regarding access to health care for a specific subgroup of the population."}
