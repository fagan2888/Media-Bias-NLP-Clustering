Anaya was one of six local reporters invited to discuss the minimum wage and Obamacare with the President for a four minute interview.\n\nHer suggestion raised the alarm that the Obama White House, already under fire for keeping the press at bay, was censoring press inquiries.\n\nCarney insisted her statement was false and at least one former White House correspondent for ABC News, Jake Tapper, now at CNN, agreed that Anaya had the facts wrong and called the suggestion \u201cnonsense.\u201d\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Jay Carney balked at the suggestion he received questions from reporters before taking the podium. 'Briefings would be a lot easier if this were true!' he said. (Alex Wong/Getty Images)\n\nBaffled that \u201cmuch had been inferred\u201d by her comment, Anaya said on Thursday that she misunderstood the protocol followed by reporters assigned to the White House since she submitted her questions to the White House before she interviewed President Obama on Wednesday.\n\nShe clarified that she wasn\u2019t asked to submit her questions but did so as a courtesy.\n\n\"I took a conversation about the preparation for a press briefing and muddied it with my own experience of wanting to provide a question for the press briefing. I incorrectly applied the process to everyone. That was wrong and it was bad reporting,\" she said in a statement.\n\nllarson@nydailynews.com", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "LESLIE LARSON", "twitter": {"description": "A local reporter not ready for the big leagues is backtracking from claims the White House prescreens questions at press briefings.
