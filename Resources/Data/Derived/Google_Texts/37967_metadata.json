It\u2019s not just the thrilling battles on the pitch. Or the fact that soccer is simply the most popular sport around. Or even the multinational mega-party as fans from around the world come together to celebrate their national teams.\n\nThe tournament also has that unquantifiable ability to generate the kind of magical \u2014 and in some cases dastardly \u2014 moments that spectators remember for the rest of their lives.\n\nHere, GlobalPost rounds up seven of the craziest:\n\n2006: Don\u2019t mess with Zizou\u2019s sister\n\nThe greatest player of his generation, France\u2019s Zinedine Zidane had masterminded his country\u2019s 1998 World Cup triumph. Eight years later he again singlehandedly dragged France to the 2006 final, this time against Italy. But the magic stopped there. In the final act of his glittering career, Zidane, known as Zizou in his homeland, headbutted Italian defender Marco Materazzi in the chest, earning an inevitable red card. What prompted the headbutt? The kind of \u201cyo mama\u201d playground insult that no pro athlete should ever let get under their skin. In his own words, Materazzi had told Zidane: \u201cI prefer the whore that is your sister.\u201d Stripped of their talisman, France lost the match and the cup. Most French people, however, didn\u2019t seem to mind. Zidane received a hero\u2019s welcome on his return to Paris.\n\n1994: A game of life and death\n\nColombia had long toiled in the shadow of Latin America\u2019s World Cup winners, Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay. The 1994 tournament was supposed to change all that, with Colombia having such a strong team that even Pele, the Brazilian usually viewed as soccer\u2019s greatest player ever, was tipping them for glory. But things didn\u2019t go that way. Terrorized by threats from drug lords back home, Colombia first lost to Romania. Then, against the US, an own goalby captain Andres Escobar all but ended the South American nation\u2019s dreams. Within days of returning home, with the World Cup still underway in the US, Escobar was gunned down outside a Medellin nightclub, shot six times in the back by a local gangster apparently motivated by Escobar\u2019s error on the pitch. The cold-blooded killing shocked fans at home and abroad.\n\n1986: Argentina\u2019s Jekyll and Hyde\n\nProbably the only challenger to Pele\u2019s title of greatest soccer player ever, Argentina\u2019s Diego Maradona epitomized the best and worst of his sport. Known for cocaine, booze, prostitutes, and offensive public statements off the pitch, he also possessed the kind of sublime skills on it that appeared to defy the laws of physics. His Jekyll and Hyde character was never clearer than when Argentina took on England in 1986, in a highly charged game just four years after the Falklands War. Argentina won after two goals by Maradona, the first scored with his hand \u2014 or by Maradona\u2019s own cryptic, arrogant confession, the \u201chand of God\u201d \u2014 and the second an outrageous individual effort that saw him dribble past the entire England defense before hitting the net, a goal later voted World Cup Goal of the Century.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Horrific fouls, sublime skills and \"yo mama\" insults -- this tournament has them all VIDEO", "author": "Simeon Tegel", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Horrific fouls, sublime skills and \"yo mama\" insults -- this tournament has them all VIDEO", "title": "7 of the craziest moments in World Cup history", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/06/08/7_of_the_craziest_moments_in_world_cup_history_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/AP761775293235-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Horrific fouls, sublime skills and \"yo mama\" insults -- this tournament has them all VIDEO", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/AP761775293235-1280x960.jpg", "title": "7 of the craziest moments in World Cup history", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "7 of the craziest moments in World Cup history", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Argentina, Diego Maradona, GlobalPost, Video, World Cup", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd80de\"", "article_summary": "Topics: Argentina, Diego Maradona, GlobalPost, Video, World Cup, Media News, Life NewsThis article originally appeared on GlobalPostLIMA, Peru \u2014 There\u2019s a reason the World Cup is the planet\u2019s most watched sporting event.\n1994: A game of life and deathColombia had long toiled in the shadow of Latin America\u2019s World Cup winners, Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay.\nHere, GlobalPost rounds up seven of the craziest:2006: Don\u2019t mess with Zizou\u2019s sisterThe greatest player of his generation, France\u2019s Zinedine Zidane had masterminded his country\u2019s 1998 World Cup triumph.\nOr even the multinational mega-party as fans from around the world come together to celebrate their national teams.\nWithin days of returning home, with the World Cup still underway in the US, Escobar was gunned down outside a Medellin nightclub, shot six times in the back by a local gangster apparently motivated by Escobar\u2019s error on the pitch."}
