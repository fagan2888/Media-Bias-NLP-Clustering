The Target Field crowd of 41,048 serenaded him with a standing ovation.\n\nCue the music: \u201cNew York, New York. \u2026 King of the Hill \u2026 Top of the Heap \u2026 A-No. 1.\u201d\n\nPan to Rockies shortstop Troy Tulowitzki, who grew up idolizing Jeter, trying to keep his raw, bubbling emotions below the surface.\n\n\u201cI was just trying to take it all in,\u201d Tulowitzki said. \u201cIt was a special moment, and I will remember it forever.\u201d\n\nAnd, oh, yeah, Jeter\u2019s American League team won the 85th All-Star Game, beating the National League 5-3.\n\nThat will matter again in October, when the American League champion has home field in the World Series.\n\nThe game-changing hits arrived in the fifth inning. All-Star Game MVP Mike Trout of the Angels, quickly emerging as the new face of baseball, hammered a double down the left-field line to score Oakland\u2019s Derek Norris and put the AL in front 4-3. Trout\u2019s double came on the heels of his first-inning triple that scored Jeter.\n\nHouston\u2019s Jose Altuve lifted a sacrifice fly to left, scoring the Chicago White Sox\u2019s Alexei Ramirez to push the American League\u2019s lead to 5-3.\n\nTulowitzki, batting third, went 1-for-3, hammering a double off the right-field wall in the fifth off Detroit right-hander Max Scherzer. Tulowitzki pulled of a nifty swim move to avoid the tag at second. Tulo, however, was stranded when Arizona\u2019s Paul Goldschmidt struck out.\n\nPHOTOS: 2014 MLB All-Star Game\n\n\u201cIt was 3-3 at the time (of his hit),\u201d Tulowitzki said, \u201cand it was a big hit for the team, but it didn\u2019t work out. I thought it might be out when I hit it, but I was happy with the double.\u201d\n\nHow about that slide?\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what happened there, but it worked out,\u201d Tulowitzki said. \u201cI know the fans got a kick of out it. I was in the dugout when they showed it on the replay, and the fans were oohing and aahing over it. I didn\u2019t know it was that good, but I guess I would have been out if I didn\u2019t do it.\u201d\n\nTulowitzki started at shortstop and played five innings in the field. He threw out Baltimore\u2019s Nelson Cruz on a routine grounder to end the first. Tulo also snared a hot liner off the bat of Detroit\u2019s Miguel Cabrera to end the third.\n\nColorado\u2019s Charlie Blackmon entered the game as the center field in the bottom of the sixth. Blackmon struck out on a foul tip in his first at-bat against Kansas City\u2019s Greg Holland.\n\nBlackmon came to the plate with two out in the ninth to face Minnesota lefty Glenn Perkins. Blackmon grounded out to short, ending the game.\n\n\u201cI felt like I was making my debut tonight,\u201d Blackmon said. \u201cI was nervous, until I got into the game. Then I was fine. \u201c\n\nWhile it was Blackmon\u2019s first All-Star Game. It was Jeter\u2019s 14th and final Midsummer Classic. He went out in style, slashing a double to right and scoring a run in the first inning. He then singled in the third in his final all-star at-bat. He left behind a star-spangled legacy: 13-for-27 (.481), two doubles and a home run. That .481 average ranks fifth all time for players with a minimum 10 at-bats.\n\nJeter\u2019s first All-Star Game appearance was at Coors Field on July 7, 1998. He was just 24. He went 0-for-1, with a strikeout. He was too scared to talk to Baltimore Orioles legend Cal Ripken Jr.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re afraid to say anything; I mean, it\u2019s Cal Ripken,\u201d Jeter said. \u201cEven though I\u2019d played against him, I hadn\u2019t really had a chance to talk to him. There are a lot of stories like that when you come to your first one.\u201d\n\nBut there didn\u2019t appear to be a scared bone in Jeter\u2019s body Tuesday night, just the calm classiness that has exemplified his career. In his final appearance in the Midsummer Classic, Jeter wrote a near-perfect ending.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Derek Jeter stars, takes a bow in leading AL to All-Star Game victory", "title": "Derek Jeter stars, takes a bow in leading AL to All-Star Game victory", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/07/15/derek-jeter-stars-takes-a-bow-in-leading-al-to-all-star-game-victory/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140715__derek-jeterp1-1.jpg", "height": 429}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140715__derek-jeterp1-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-15T21:51:46+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T11:49:25+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cIt was a special moment, and I will remember it forever.\u201dAnd, oh, yeah, Jeter\u2019s American League team won the 85th All-Star Game, beating the National League 5-3.\n\u201cWhile it was Blackmon\u2019s first All-Star Game.\nJeter\u2019s first All-Star Game appearance was at Coors Field on July 7, 1998.\nAll-Star Game MVP Mike Trout of the Angels, quickly emerging as the new face of baseball, hammered a double down the left-field line to score Oakland\u2019s Derek Norris and put the AL in front 4-3.\n1.\u201dPan to Rockies shortstop Troy Tulowitzki, who grew up idolizing Jeter, trying to keep his raw, bubbling emotions below the surface."}
