Steve Warren said none of the additional 450 troops will be trainers.\n\nCol. Warren said none of the personnel are prepared or equipped to conduct training. He said the troops will be advising and assisting Iraqi forces, especially in retaking Ramadi, and making connections with Sunni tribes to eventually train them.\n\n\u201cNo trainers, no one teaching people how to shoot straight. What they\u2019re doing there is a different type of mission,\u201d Col. Warren said.\n\nThe troops will be sent to support local Iraqi security forces at a former U.S. military base in eastern Anbar province, a Sunni-dominated region where Islamic State fighters seized the key city of Ramadi three weeks ago. Mr. Obama issued his order just two days after saying his administration still lacked a \u201ccomplete\u201d strategy for improving the training of Iraqi troops, who\u2019ve been criticized for fleeing instead of fighting.\n\nThe decision to send more advisers drew mixed reviews on Capitol Hill. Speaker John A. Boehner, Ohio Republican, called it a step in the right direction but said Mr. Obama still lacks an \u201coverarching strategy\u201d for defeating the Islamic State.\n\nSenate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain, Arizona Republican, called the president\u2019s move \u201cincrementalism at its best or worst, depending on how you describe it.\u201d\n\nEven Mr. Obama\u2019s former military intelligence chief, retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, said in testimony to lawmakers Wednesday that there\u2019s \u201cabsolutely no end in sight and no clear U.S. policy\u201d in Iraq and Syria.\n\nThe White House said Mr. Obama made the decision after a request from Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi and upon the recommendation of his top U.S. military advisers.\n\n\u201cThis train, advise and assist mission builds on lessons learned during the past several months and is just one aspect of our commitment to support the Iraqi Security Forces,\u201d said White House press secretary Josh Earnest.\n\nThe new order brings the overall U.S. troop level in Iraq to around 3,550, with most of them involved in training projects. Mr. Obama had withdrawn the last U.S. troops from Iraq in 2011, but has been forced reluctantly to send a growing number of military advisers and to order airstrikes as the Islamic State has grown in numbers, territory and battlefield victories.\n\nSeveral senators said the administration\u2019s move highlights the need for Congress to officially authorize American operations against the Islamic State, which lawmakers have declined to consider for nearly a year.\n\nSen. Tim Kaine, Virginia Democrat, said as U.S. assistance in the campaign against the Islamic State increases, so should the urgency among members of Congress to pass a new war authorization to present a united front in the conflict to allies, enemies and troops.\n\n\u201cIt sure is evidence of the position that a need for an authorization is more urgent,\u201d Mr. Kaine, a member of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, which would consider an authorization, told reporters Wednesday. \u201cThis is not going away any time soon. It is not going to be short.\u201d\n\nThe president sent Congress his proposed war authorization in February amid criticism from both sides of the aisle that he didn\u2019t provide a draft until six months into the campaign. Mr. Obama\u2019s three-year authorization for the use of military force, or AUMF in legislative speak, would prohibit U.S. troops from participating in \u201cenduring offensive ground combat operations,\u201d a murky restriction that made some on Capitol Hill see it as a blank check and others see it as needlessly tying the president\u2019s hands in combat.\n\nEven without a new authorization on the books, Mr. Obama has been conducting strikes since August under previous war authorizations from 2002 against Iraq and 2001 against al Qaeda, which was passed in the days after 9/11 and, many argue, is being stretched to its legal limit to cover the current conflict.\n\nMr. Kaine\u2019s bipartisan authorization for the use of military force, introduced this week along with Sen. Jeff Flake, Arizona Republican, tries to strike a balance between Democrats who said the president\u2019s plan wasn\u2019t restrictive enough and Republicans who felt it was too restrictive. This inability to find middle ground is the reason behind Congress abdicating its responsibility to declare war for months, Mr. Kaine said.\n\n\u201cThere are important differences in detail and, I think, the differences in detail have stopped Congress from acting,\u201d he said.\n\nThe three-year plan from Mr. Kaine and Mr. Flake would prohibit \u201cthe use of significant United States ground troops in combat against ISIL, except to protect the lives of United States citizens from imminent threat.\u201d\n\nIt would also sunset a 2002 authorization for force in Iraq, like the president\u2019s plan, and make the Islamic State-specific authorization the only legal authority for current strikes, eliminating a loophole where the administration could continue operating under the 2001 authorization despite Congress passing new wording.\n\nMr. Kaine said that while he thinks the plan could be voted on as is, he\u2019s open to colleagues raising amendments and debating the details of the plan because it\u2019s so important to have this national conversation.\n\n\u201cThe 23 minutes we talked about this yesterday is the most we\u2019ve talked about it in any formal meeting since December,\u201d Mr. Kaine said of the introduction of his plan in a Senate Foreign Relations Committee meeting on Tuesday. \u201cWe got to sit around and listen to each other and share ideas, and I would suspect that our draft is going to be the starting point.\u201d\n\nMr. Flake said that he expected the Senate Foreign Relations Committee would discuss his proposal within the next \u201cseveral weeks.\u201d\n\nMr. Boehner, who for months demanded Mr. Obama send up a war request, now says the president should tear up his current plan and start over.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear that our training mission alone has not been enough,\u201d he said, adding that someone will need to do more on the ground \u2014 whether it be the U.S. or its allies.\n\nAdministration officials insisted that the new plan is not a change in U.S. strategy, but an effort to get Sunnis more involved in the fight.\n\nThere are persistent criticisms that the Shiite-led Iraqi government in Baghdad under Mr. al-Abadi isn\u2019t committed to recruiting Sunni tribesmen as fighters, a weakness that contributed to the ouster of previous Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki.\n\nIslamic State militants have held the northern city of Mosul in Iraq for a year, and have controlled Fallujah for more than a year.\n\nWhite House Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes said Mr. Obama also ordered \u201cexpediting delivery\u201d of military equipment and material to the Iraqi central government to aid its security forces in the north and west of the country.\n\n\u201cWe want to make sure that the Iraqis fighting [the Islamic State] on the ground have the equipment they need,\u201d Mr. Rhodes said.\n\nAs part of the revised strategy, the U.S. will provide $8.3 million to an international stabilization fund to help Iraqis in areas cleared of the Islamic State.\n\nWhite House officials also acknowledged that the Islamic State\u2019s battle campaign in the Euphrates River Valley has been aimed ultimately at attacking Baghdad, the capital of Iraq.\n\nMr. Rhodes said U.S. troops will not serve as advisers alongside Iraqi forces in the field, nor will they help in coordinating airstrikes. He said the administration\u2019s \u201coverriding focus\u201d is making sure to boost \u201cIraqi capacity on the ground.\u201d\n\n\u201cIraqis want to be in the lead themselves,\u201d Mr. Rhodes said. \u201cThat would be a more sustainable model.\u201d\n\nBut another presidential aide said Mr. Obama \u201chasn\u2019t ruled out any additional steps,\u201d and that deploying additional troops later is possible.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Under pressure to come up with a winning strategy to defeat the Islamic State, President Obama ordered up to 450 more U.S. troops to Iraq Wednesday to \"advise and assist\" Iraqi forces, as Capitol Hill lawmakers pressed for a greater role in authorizing the burgeoning military operation.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Under pressure to come up with a winning strategy to defeat the Islamic State, President Obama ordered up to 450 more U.S. troops to Iraq Wednesday to \u201cadvise and assist\u201d Iraqi forces, as Capitol Hill lawmakers pressed for a greater role in authorizing the burgeoning military operation.", "title": "Obama sending hundreds of troops to Iraq to train nation\u2019s military", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jun/10/obama-send-hundreds-troops-iraq-train-military/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/05/27/Mideast_Iraq_Islamic_State.JPEG-025de.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/05/27/Mideast_Iraq_Islamic_State.JPEG-025de.jpg", "description": "Under pressure to come up with a winning strategy to defeat the Islamic State, President Obama ordered up to 450 more U.S. troops to Iraq Wednesday to \"advise and assist\" Iraqi forces, as Capitol Hill", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Obama sending hundreds of troops to Iraq to train nation\u2019s milit"}, "Author": "Dave Boyer, Jacqueline Klimas and Dave Boyer, Jacqueline Klimas", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "War Conflict, Politics, White House, Iraq, Steve Warren"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf730\"", "article_summary": "Mr. Obama issued his order just two days after saying his administration still lacked a \u201ccomplete\u201d strategy for improving the training of Iraqi troops, who\u2019ve been criticized for fleeing instead of fighting.\n\u201cThat would be a more sustainable model.\u201dBut another presidential aide said Mr. Obama \u201chasn\u2019t ruled out any additional steps,\u201d and that deploying additional troops later is possible.\nSpeaker John A.
