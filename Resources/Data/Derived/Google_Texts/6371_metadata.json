Ted Cruz (Tex.) scolded the moderators of last month\u2019s CNBC debate, saying, \u201cThe questions asked in this debate illustrate why the American people don\u2019t trust the media.\u201d Likewise, Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.) declared, \u201cThe Democrats have the ultimate super PAC. It\u2019s called the mainstream media.\u201d And more recently, Ben Carson accused the media of reporting \u201ca bunch of lies\u201d that called into question parts of his biography. \u201cI think it\u2019s pathetic, and basically what the media does is they try to get you distracted,\u201d he said.\n\nRepublicans are right to criticize the mainstream media, but they are doing it for the wrong reasons. That\u2019s because the biggest problem with the media today is not their alleged liberal bias. Rather, it\u2019s a corporatized system that is rigged against the public interest and failing our democracy. If they are truly interested in making the media better, here are three principles that politicians from both parties should embrace.\n\n1. No more mergers. Earlier this year, Comcast abandoned its proposed merger with Time Warner Cable after the Federal Communications Commission and Justice Department signaled that they would oppose it. The collapse of the deal between the country\u2019s two largest cable companies, which opponents argued would lead to higher prices and worse customer service, was an important victory for consumers and media reformers alike. As former FCC commissioner Michael Copps wrote at the time, \u201ccombining America\u2019s two largest cable providers would have been anti-competitive, anti-consumer and anti-democracy.\u201d But the merger\u2019s defeat, while critical, was only one battle in a much larger war against media conglomeratization.\n\nAlmost immediately after Comcast dropped out, Charter Communications, the fourth-largest cable company, initiated its own bid to take over Time Warner Cable. A coalition of reform groups, including Common Cause and Free Press, is campaigning against the deal and asking supporters to sign a letter of opposition to the FCC. \u201cIf the transaction were approved,\u201d the coalition warns, \u201cNew Charter and Comcast together would form a national broadband duopoly controlling nearly two-thirds of existing customers and the telecommunications wires connected to nearly 8 out of every 10 U.S. homes.\u201d\n\n2. Protect the open Internet. As I\u2019ve written in the past, net neutrality is essential to our democracy because it preserves equal access to the Internet and prevents corporate interests from putting up barriers to the marketplace of ideas. In 2014, the FCC received about 4 million public comments on its proposed net neutrality rules, shattering the record set after Janet Jackson\u2019s televised \u201cwardrobe malfunction\u201d during the Super Bowl a decade earlier. President Obama responded to the American people\u2019s clear demands by calling on the FCC to adopt \u201cthe strongest possible rules to protect net neutrality,\u201d specifically endorsing the reclassification of the Internet as a public utility.\n\nThe FCC approved important regulations in February despite the objections of cable and telecommunications companies, as well as near-unanimous opposition from Republican lawmakers. Cruz, for example, has disparaged net neutrality as \u201cObamacare for the Internet.\u201d Though the rules went into effect earlier this year, the fight is not over. In addition to introducing legislation to repeal the regulations, a group of House Republicans filed a legal complaint in early November contending that the FCC lacked the authority to act on net neutrality without input from Congress.\n\n3. Enforce disclosure rules. The 2016 election is expected to cost significantly more than the $6 billion spent in 2012. According to one estimate, television ads alone will account for some $4.4 billion in spending, much of it from super PACs and secretive \u201cdark money\u201d groups. For now, the avalanche of big money in our politics is inevitable, but there is a way to better inform the public and hold billionaire donors accountable. As Copps wrote in 2013, \u201cAll we need is for an independent agency, the Federal Communications Commission, to enforce a campaign finance disclosure requirement that is already on the books.\u201d\n\nIn fact, there has been a rule in place since 1934 that requires television broadcasters to disclose the \u201ctrue sponsor\u201d of all advertisements. If properly enforced, the rule would entitle viewers to see not only the name of the group sponsoring political ads but also the donors behind them. Last month, Common Cause, the Sunlight Foundation, the Campaign Legal Center and Georgetown Law\u2019s Institute for Public Representation sent a letter calling on the FCC to force the disclosure of who is paying for campaign ads. \u201cVoters across the land are under assault from shadowy secret money groups,\u201d said Copps, who is now an adviser to Common Cause. \u201cThe FCC has the authority it needs right now to shine a light on all those anonymous broadcast and cable ads.\u201d\n\nWhile the three principles above are essential, the mainstream media obviously have more problems, too: their dedication to false balance, their bias toward sensationalism, their neglect of consequential issues, their policing of the debate. As Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) said during this weekend\u2019s Democratic debate, \u201cWhat I would like for the media now is for us to be talking about why the middle class is disappearing, why we have more people in jail than any other country, why we have massive levels of income and wealth inequality, and we\u2019re the only major country on Earth without paid family and medical leave. We\u2019ve gotten off the Hillary\u2019s e-mails, good. Let\u2019s go to the major issues facing America.\u201d\n\nBut the mainstream media will never do those issues justice as long as they are more accountable to powerful corporate interests than the people they serve. That\u2019s why, as 2016 approaches, it\u2019s as important as ever for keep building the movement for reform. \u201cWithout media reform, we simply cannot reform our country,\u201d Copps told me. \u201cNo matter what issue a voter cares about, it won\u2019t get anywhere with the media corporate-speak and infotainment that we\u2019re being fed. Big media gatekeepers are America\u2019s embarrassment.\u201d\n\nRead more from Katrina vanden Heuvel\u2019s archive or follow her on Twitter.", "article_metadata": {"description": "What\u2019s needed, rather, is competition, net neutrality and enforcement of political-ad disclosure rules.", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100000403637764", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "What\u2019s needed, rather, is competition, net neutrality and enforcement of political-ad disclosure rules.", "title": "Why the biggest problem with the media is not \u2018liberal bias\u2019", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/why-the-biggest-problem-with-the-media-is-not-liberal-bias/2015/11/17/df1dd13e-8c8e-11e5-acff-673ae92ddd2b_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/11/17/Editorial-Opinion/Images/GOP_2016_Cruz_Taxes-0ad10-1502.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@KatrinaNation"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/why-the-biggest-problem-with-the-media-is-not-liberal-bias/2015/11/17/df1dd13e-8c8e-11e5-acff-673ae92ddd2b_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Katrina vanden Heuvel, marco rubio, ted cruz, ben carson, media, cable, internet, open internet, net neutrality, comcast, time warner cable, merger, charter communications, federal communications commission, 2016 election, political advertising, bernie sanders", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100000403637764"}, "eomportal-uuid": "df1dd13e-8c8e-11e5-acff-673ae92ddd2b", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "Katrina vanden Heuvel, marco rubio, ted cruz, ben carson, media, cable, internet, open internet, net neutrality, comcast, time warner cable, merger, charter communications, federal communications commission, 2016 election, political advertising, bernie sanders"}, "article_summary": "That\u2019s because the biggest problem with the media today is not their alleged liberal bias.\nIt\u2019s called the mainstream media.\u201d And more recently, Ben Carson accused the media of reporting \u201ca bunch of lies\u201d that called into question parts of his biography.\nRepublicans are right to criticize the mainstream media, but they are doing it for the wrong reasons.\n\u201cWithout media reform, we simply cannot reform our country,\u201d Copps told me.\nLet\u2019s go to the major issues facing America.\u201dBut the mainstream media will never do those issues justice as long as they are more accountable to powerful corporate interests than the people they serve."}
