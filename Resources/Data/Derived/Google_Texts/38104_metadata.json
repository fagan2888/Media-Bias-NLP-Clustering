This growth has decreased the need for charity care from Allegiance, freeing resources to invest in programs and services that benefit all community members.\n\nThe ruling not only helps achieve the law's national coverage expansion goals, Allegiance President and CEO Georgia Fojtasek said in a statement. \"But closer to home, this ruling means continued coverage and access to much-needed healthcare services for thousands across our area.\"\n\nAccording to the Kaiser Family Foundation, a California-headquartered healthcare research organization sourced by Allegiance Health, almost 230,000 people in Michigan would have seen a 294 percent increase in their average premium cost.\n\nWithout the tax credits, the number of uninsured people in Michigan would have risen by an estimated 277,000, the Center for Family Health stated, citing the Washington, D.C.-based Urban Institute, which does economic and social policy research.\n\nKaser was \"beyond anxious\" about the long-anticipated ruling. \"I was very, very relieved and please when the decision was announced. I wanted to get up and do a dance.\"\n\nKaser said people, now insured thanks to Obamacare, are seeking treatment for chronic or long-term conditions, such as Diabetes, they might have once treated themselves. Instead of only visiting the center or some other care provider when they have a problem, they are receiving preventative care.\n\nAs a result, \"people are going to live longer,\" Kaser said.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "news", "title": "Jackson health officials laud Supreme Court ruling on Affordable Care Act", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Jackson health officials laud Supreme Court ruling on Affordable Care Act\", \"link\": \"http://www.mlive.com/news/jackson/index.ssf/2015/06/jackson_health_officials_laud.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.mlive.com/home/mlive-media/width620/img/citpat/news_impact/photo/18205169-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"16394564\", \"pub_date\": \"2015-06-26T21:54:35Z\", \"author\": \"Danielle Salisbury | Danielle_Salisbury@mlive.com\", \"tags\": [\"@jx-river\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.mlive.com/citpat/news_impact/photo/18205169-thumb_square_large.jpg", "description": "\"This ruling is great news for everyone who supports the mission of opening the door to healthcare for all,\" Molly Kaser, President and CEO of the Center for Family Health in Jackson, said in a statement.", "card": "summary", "site": "@mlive"}, "article_date_updated": "Friday, June 26, 2015,  5:54 PM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"short_title\": \"\", \"image_url\": \"http://media.mlive.com/citpat/news_impact/photo/women-ceos-lead-jackson-area-health-care-industry-3060dea88f5679a9.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"dquisenb\", \"author_nickname\": \"Danielle Salisbury | Danielle_Salisbury@mlive.com\", \"author_id\": \"2442\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Jackson News\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.mlive.com/news/jackson/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "MLive.com", "description": "\"This ruling is great news for everyone who supports the mission of opening the door to healthcare for all,\" Molly Kaser, President and CEO of the Center for Family Health in Jackson, said in a statement.", "title": "Jackson health officials laud Supreme Court ruling on Affordable Care Act", "url": "http://www.mlive.com/news/jackson/index.ssf/2015/06/jackson_health_officials_laud.html", "image": "http://media.mlive.com/citpat/news_impact/photo/18205169-thumb_square_large.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "MLive.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Friday, June 26, 2015,  5:54 PM", "article_author": "Danielle Salisbury | Danielle_Salisbury@mlive.com", "Description": "\"This ruling is great news for everyone who supports the mission of opening the door to healthcare for all,\" Molly Kaser, President and CEO of the Center for Family Health in Jackson, said in a statement."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc3e3\"", "article_summary": "JACKSON, MI \u2013 Jackson County health authorities are lauding this week's U.S. Supreme Court ruling upholding the legality of subsidies given to low- and middle-income Americans buying health insurance through federal exchanges.\nIn Jackson County, Medicaid enrollment has grown by 9,876 since President Barack Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law in March 2010, according to a statement from Allegiance Health.\nThe ruling not only helps achieve the law's national coverage expansion goals, Allegiance President and CEO Georgia Fojtasek said in a statement.\n\"But closer to home, this ruling means continued coverage and access to much-needed healthcare services for thousands across our area.\"\n\"This ruling is great news for everyone who supports the mission of opening the door to healthcare for all,\" Molly Kaser, President and CEO of the Center for Family Health in Jackson, said in a statement."}
