The pension fund, though a sizable North American limited partner, is dwarfed by investment giants such as the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority and Singapore\u2019s GIC Private Ltd.\n\nMore sovereign-wealth funds are seeking to bypass funds as a source of deals as they get more familiar with private equity investing. Direct transactions that these investors backed rose to $50.02 billion for the first half of 2014, a 23.1% increase from year-earlier results, according to the Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute.\n\nTexas Teachers sources co-investment deals, which it calls \u201cprincipal investments,\u201d by focusing on a network of existing general partners and strategic partners.\n\n\u201cWe have to convince these guys that we are the people to bring big investments to,\u201d Mr. Harris said.\n\nThe pension fund may consider stationing staff in other major cities to expand its presence beyond its Austin, Tex., stronghold. It also is trying to structure transactions creatively.\n\n\u201cWe have to come up with new ways of structuring things,\u201d said Eric Lang, senior managing director of real assets and private equity.\n\nTexas Teachers said it hopes to become involved in deals before they are signed and syndicated across a manager\u2019s limited partner base.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d like to be a full underwriting partner,\u201d Mr. Lang said. He raised the possibility that if the pension fund has a larger role in due diligence before a deal closes, \u201cWe might have to share in deal costs with the [general partner].\u201d\n\nA team is reviewing additional costs that it might have to foot by playing a more direct role in deal making.\n\nWhat is at stake for the Texas Teachers: The ability to be able to replicate past successes of its private equity co-investments program. The pension fund\u2019s 20 private equity \u201cprincipal investments,\u201d valued at $2.2 billion as of Sept. 30, delivered a five-year internal rate of return, which outperformed its $12.9 billion in private equity fund holdings in the same period, according to a presentation shown to trustees last month.\n\nSovereign-wealth assets are estimated to have rose to about $7.1 trillion at the end of 2014, from roughly $3.3 trillion in 2007, according to the Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Public pension funds have to step up their game and fight harder for co-investment deals as sovereign-wealth funds, fast-rising titans in private equity, are increasingly dominating the market, according to officials at the Teacher Retirement System of Texas.", "title": "Committed: Texas Pension Plan Says Sovereign-Wealth Funds Are Disrupting Co-Investment Market", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/privateequity/2015/03/06/committed-texas-pension-plan-says-sovereign-wealth-funds-are-disrupting-co-investment-market/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/img/WSJ_profile_lg.gif"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Markets", "article.headline": "Committed: Texas Pension Plan Says Sovereign-Wealth Funds Are Disrupting Co-Investment Market", "description": "Public pension funds have to step up their game and fight harder for co-investment deals as sovereign-wealth funds, fast-rising titans in private equity, are increasingly dominating the market, according to officials at the Teacher Retirement System of Texas.", "article_section": "Markets", "author": "Dawn Lim", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "testkeys": "C", "article.page": "Private Equity Beat Blog", "page.subsection": "Private Equity Beat", "article.summary": "Public pension funds have to step up their game and fight harder for co-investment deals as sovereign-wealth funds, fast-rising titans in private equity, are increasingly dominating the market, according to officials at the Teacher Retirement System of Texas.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "page.content.format": "responsive", "article.published": "2015-03-06T16:50:01-05:00", "dj.asn": "10-140", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/privateequity/2015/03/06/committed-texas-pension-plan-says-sovereign-wealth-funds-are-disrupting-co-investment-market/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-PEBB-18141", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Markets", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Public pension funds have to step up their game and fight harder for co-investment deals as sovereign-wealth funds, fast-rising titans in private equity, are increasingly dominating the market, according to officials at the Teacher Retirement System of Texas.", "title": "Committed: Texas Pension Plan Says Sovereign-Wealth Funds Are Disrupting Co-Investment Market", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/privateequity/2015/03/06/committed-texas-pension-plan-says-sovereign-wealth-funds-are-disrupting-co-investment-market/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/blogs/img/WSJ_Logo_BlackBackground_1200x630social", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Private Equity Beat", "article.id": "BL-PEBB-18141", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2015-03-06T16:52:09-05:00"}, "article_summary": "The pension fund may consider stationing staff in other major cities to expand its presence beyond its Austin, Tex., stronghold.\n\u201cThe whole emergence of sovereign wealth funds is disrupting the market,\u201d said Britt Harris, the chief investment officer of the roughly $132 billion pension system during a board meeting in February.\n\u201cWe have to come up with new ways of structuring things,\u201d said Eric Lang, senior managing director of real assets and private equity.\nTexas Teachers, which Mr. Harris said could \u201ceasily\u201d do transactions above $100 million, faces intense competition for large co-investment deals as sovereign-wealth funds increase in influence.\nWhat is at stake for the Texas Teachers: The ability to be able to replicate past successes of its private equity co-investments program."}
