But the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that provision unconstitutional, creating the coverage gap consisting of individuals who make too much money to qualify for Medicaid but not enough to qualify for tax credits to purchase coverage through state or federal health insurance marketplaces.\n\nIn states that have approved Medicaid expansion and have a large Hispanic population, uninsured Hispanic adults are less likely to fall into the coverage gap, according to one of the Kaiser reports. Texas is among the 23 states that chose not to expand Medicaid eligibility under the Affordable Care Act, which is commonly known as Obamacare.\n\nMore than a fifth of all people in the coverage gap live in Texas. Additionally, 59 percent of the nation\u2019s 1 million uninsured Hispanic adults in the coverage gap reside in Texas.\n\nIn other states that opted not to expand Medicaid, particularly in the South, uninsured black adults make up the minority group more likely to be left without a new health coverage option, according to the Kaiser reports. But in Texas, uninsured black adults only make up 15 percent of the state\u2019s uninsured adults who fall in the coverage gap.\n\nStill, 12 percent of the nation\u2019s 1.3 million uninsured black adults in the coverage gap live in Texas.\n\nOverall, Texas has the highest rate of uninsured individuals, with nearly a quarter of the population living without health insurance, according to census data.\n\nAccording to the Kaiser reports, states that chose to not expand Medicaid are hindering efforts to address long-standing disparities in health coverage rates and outcomes among minorities that the expansion could significantly improve.\n\n\u201cLast, the population in the coverage gap shows that, as a result of state decisions not to expand their Medicaid programs, many remaining uninsured under the ACA will reflect the legacy of the system linking Medicaid coverage to only certain categories of people,\u201d one of the reports states. \u201cThe ACA Medicaid expansion was designed to end categorical eligibility for Medicaid, but in states not implementing the expansion, the vestiges of categorical eligibility will remain.\"\n\nThis story was produced in partnership with Kaiser Health News, an editorially independent program of the Henry J.
