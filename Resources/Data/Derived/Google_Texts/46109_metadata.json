We're a two-income couple. How much of an impact will getting married have on our taxes?\n\n\u2014 E.S., New York City\n\nA: Without knowing all the details of your tax situation, it's impossible to reply with certainty. But the impact could be surprisingly large.\n\nMany two-income couples who get married wind up owing more in taxes on a combined basis than if each had remained single. This so-called \"marriage penalty\" often hammers higher-income couples such as you. (This couple's combined income is six figures.) But it can also hurt some low-income couples, too.\n\nBefore you call off the wedding, however, crunch the numbers. This can be highly complex, and many people actually wind up owing less by getting married, says Len Burman, director of the Tax Policy Center, a joint venture of the Urban Institute and Brookings Institution.\n\nFor example, \"if your incomes are very dissimilar, or one person doesn't have any income at all, you're likely to pay significantly lower taxes if you get married,\" says Mr. Burman, a former Treasury Department official. This is known as a \"marriage bonus.\"\n\nDon't hold your breath waiting for Congress to change the rules. Fixing the marriage-penalty problem would be very costly. Also, lawmakers probably won't approve any significant tax legislation until after November's elections.\n\nYou also asked: If you'll get hit hard by the marriage penalty, what can you do about it, other than remaining single? One idea: Postpone your wedding until next year; you'll at least avoid the penalty this year.\n\nThe IRS says you're unmarried for the entire year \"if, on the last day of your tax year, you are unmarried or legally separated from your spouse under a divorce or separate maintenance decree.\" By delaying, some people, especially higher-income couples in your situation, may even be able to save enough to pay for their honeymoon.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "article.created": "2014-09-07T00:13:00.000Z", "article.section": "Personal Finance", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "Article", "twitter": {"domain": "wsj.com", "description": "For high-income couples, the 'marriage penalty' can be substantial.", "title": "The Tax Impact of Getting Married", "image": {"alt": "In the WSJ Sunday, Tom Herman explains the tax impact of getting married", "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/img/WSJ_Logo_black_social.gif"}, "site": "@WSJ", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "wsj://launch?articleid=SB10001424052970204275904580129954185862396&headline=In%20the%20WSJ%20Sunday%2C%20Tom%20Herman%20explains%20the%20tax%20impact%20of%20getting%20married&weburl=http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204275904580129954185862396"}}, "page.site.product": "WSJ", "keywords": "filing separately,filing together,income taxes,marriage penalty,two-income home,political,general news,family finance,personal finance,politics,international relations,domestic politics,tax strategies,government bodies,executive branch,treasury department,advice", "news_keywords": "filing separately,filing together,income taxes,marriage penalty,two-income home,political,general news,family finance,personal finance,politics", "article.headline": "In the WSJ Sunday, Tom Herman explains the tax impact of getting married", "description": "For high-income couples, the 'marriage penalty' can be substantial.", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=364387007,app-argument=wsj://launch?articleid=SB10001424052970204275904580129954185862396&headline=In%20the%20WSJ%20Sunday%2C%20Tom%20Herman%20explains%20the%20tax%20impact%20of%20getting%20married&weburl=http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204275904580129954185862396", "user.type": "nonsubscriber", "article.page": "US", "page.content.format": "responsive", "article.summary": "For high-income couples, the 'marriage penalty' can be substantial.", "page.site": "wsj", "testkeys": "B", "article.published": "2014-09-07T00:13:00.000Z", "dj.asn": "i-43d1", "robots": "noarchive,noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"internal_link_count": 1, "embed_count": 1, "word_count": 315, "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Article", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "For high-income couples, the 'marriage penalty' can be substantial.", "title": "The Tax Impact of Getting Married", "url": "http://www.wsj.com/articles/the-tax-impact-of-getting-married-1410048829", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/img/WSJ_Logo_black_social.gif", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "author": "Tom Herman", "article.access": "free", "page.content.source": "WSJ Online Article", "article.origheadline": "The Tax Impact of Getting Married", "article.type": "Ask Dow Jones", "article.id": "SB10001424052970204275904580129954185862396", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-09-07T00:13:00.000Z"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb8c6\"", "article_summary": "How much of an impact will getting married have on our taxes?\nMany two-income couples who get married wind up owing more in taxes on a combined basis than if each had remained single.\n\u2014 E.S., New York CityA: Without knowing all the details of your tax situation, it's impossible to reply with certainty.\nYou also asked: If you'll get hit hard by the marriage penalty, what can you do about it, other than remaining single?\nThis can be highly complex, and many people actually wind up owing less by getting married, says Len Burman, director of the Tax Policy Center, a joint venture of the Urban Institute and Brookings Institution."}
