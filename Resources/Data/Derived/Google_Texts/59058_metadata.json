He reasons that the court may have been defrauded by the government, thus requiring the appointment of an outside judge to handle the matter going forward.\n\nThe Holder DOJ brought the case against Sierra Pacific for allegedly being responsible for a wildfire that destroyed 65,000 acres in California. Sierra Pacific maintained that the fire started elsewhere and that state and federal investigators and DOJ attorneys lied about the origin of the fire so they would have a \u201cdeep pocket\u201d from which to collect millions of dollars.\n\nNonetheless, as litigants confronted by the power of the federal government are wont to do, the company settled the case. It agreed to pay $55 million to the United States over a period of five years and to give up 22,500 acres of land.\n\nBut now two former DOJ lawyers in the office that prosecuted the action corroborate Sierra Pacific\u2019s claim that the DOJ\u2019s case was based on fraud and deception. Using information provided by these lawyers, Sierra Pacific told the federal court that \u201cthe United States presented false evidence to the Defendants and the Court [and] advanced arguments to the Court premised on that false evidence or for which material evidence had been withheld.\u201d\n\nIn addition, the United States \u201cprepared key. . .investigators for depositions, and allowed them to repeatedly give false testimony about the most important aspects of their investigation.\u201d The United States also \u201cfailed to disclose the facts and circumstances associated with the. . .lead investigator\u2019s direct financial interest in the outcome of the investigation arising from an illegal bank account that has since been exposed and terminated.\u201d\n\nOne of the former DOJ lawyers says he was removed from the original prosecution by his boss, David Shelledy, chief of the civil division in the United States Attorney\u2019s office, because he \u201crebuffed\u201d pressure to \u201cengage in unethical conduct as a lawyer.\u201d According to the Observer, Eric Holder will this week award Shelledy the Department\u2019s highest award for excellence.\n\nIt figures.\n\nAnother former DOJ lawyer left the prosecution team stating: \u201cIt\u2019s called the Department of Justice; it\u2019s not called the Department of Revenue.\u201d He reportedly told defense counsel that in his entire career, \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like this.\u201d\n\nNaturally, the allegations of these former prosecutors made a big impression on the court. As noted, the chief judge of the District, Morrison England, Jr., ordered the recusal of all the Eastern District judges from the case due to evidence that the government defrauded the court. He referred the case to Alex Kozinski, Chief Judge of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, so Kozinski could appoint a judge from outside the Eastern District to handle the case.\n\nIn a related case, a California state judge found that the investigation and prosecution of this matter by the state involved \u201cegregious,\u201d \u201cpervasive,\u201d and \u201creprehensible\u201d abuses that amount to \u201cgovernment corruption.\u201d The state court case \u201cbetray[ed] the primary purpose of the judicial system\u2014to reveal the truth,\u201d the judge stated.\n\nThe Department of Justice exists to promote justice, not to collect money by winning cases. A lawyer representing a private individual may have to take positions he considers unmeritorious in order to serve his client. Even so, such a lawyer cannot advance his client\u2019s interest through fraud.\n\nA government lawyer should never take an unmeritorious position. If doing so is required to win a case, the government shouldn\u2019t pursue the case. Unlike a private party, the government has no valid interest in winning cases it doesn\u2019t deserve to win.\n\nThis view is anachronistic, of course. Government lawyers are as ambitious as private lawyers \u2014 maybe more so because they are more likely to be shooting for a judgeship or a move into the lucrative world of private practice. Many government lawyers are also zealots.\n\nThus, the modern government lawyer has no compunction about trying to sell arguments with scant support in the law or the facts, and there isn\u2019t much anyone can do about it. But when ambition and/or ideology induce government lawyers to rely on facts they know have been invented or to fail to meet the legal obligation to disclose facts, the line has been crossed.\n\nIt isn\u2019t surprising that, in the lawless, leftist crony-favoring environment of the Holder DOJ, Sierra Pacific appears to be the victim of a lawless prosecution. The case against it fits a pattern of abuse.\n\nIn this instance, David Shelledy, who drove the prosecution against Sierra Pacific, reportedly had a history of resisting the disclosure in environmental cases of evidence the DOJ is required to disclose. The Department\u2019s office of professional responsibility is said to have rejected his positions on this issue in previous cases.\n\nBut the Holder DOJ did not rein Shelledy in. And now, it is about to award him for \u201cexcellence.\u201d\n\nShelledy is thus the very model of a Holder DOJ attorney. And if the reports of his conduct in the Sierra Pacific case are accurate, that\u2019s a disgrace.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Power Line", "description": "The New York Observer reports that two former Assistant United States Attorneys say the Holder Justice Department engaged in deceit and corruption of justice in connection with the DOJ\u2019s liti\u2026", "title": "Government case implodes as its former lawyers allege fraud against Holder DOJ", "url": "http://on.powerlineblog.com/archives/2014/10/government-case-implodes-as-ex-doj-lawyers-allege-fraud-against-holder-doj.php", "image": "http://www.powerlineblog.com/wp-content/themes/powerline/images/icon.png", "locale": "en_US", "type": "powerlineblog:article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://i0.wp.com/www.powerlineblog.com/ed-assets/2014/10/sierra-pacific-industries-bp002_8904481_ver1_0_640_480.png?resize=640%2C360&w=240", "site": "@powerlineus", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "NOODP", "wp-parsely_version": "1.7", "fb": {"admins": "505151,john.hinderaker,scottwynnjohnson,750972908", "app_id": 154257474630565}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-10-19T05:57:45+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-19T06:01:41+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce2c0\"", "article_summary": "The Holder DOJ brought the case against Sierra Pacific for allegedly being responsible for a wildfire that destroyed 65,000 acres in California.\nAnd if the reports of his conduct in the Sierra Pacific case are accurate, that\u2019s a disgrace.\nIt isn\u2019t surprising that, in the lawless, leftist crony-favoring environment of the Holder DOJ, Sierra Pacific appears to be the victim of a lawless prosecution.\nBut now two former DOJ lawyers in the office that prosecuted the action corroborate Sierra Pacific\u2019s claim that the DOJ\u2019s case was based on fraud and deception.\nIt agreed to pay $55 million to the United States over a period of five years and to give up 22,500 acres of land."}
