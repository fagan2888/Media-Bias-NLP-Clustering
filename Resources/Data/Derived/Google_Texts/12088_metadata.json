That\u2019s up from 3% the year before.\n\nSince 2008, average family premiums have climbed a total of $4,865.\n\nThe White House cheered the news, saying it was a sign of continued slow growth in premium costs.\n\nThat much is true. Since 2006, the average annual increase for family plans at work has been 4.9%, down from around 10% a year from 1999-2005.\n\nSlightly less higher premiums aren\u2019t what President Obama promised Americans when he ran for office touting his medical overhaul. He specifically said his plan would cut premiums.\n\n\u201cWe will start,\u201d Obama said back in 2008, \u201cby reducing premiums by as much as $2,500 per family.\u201d\n\nThat $2,500 figure was Obama\u2019s mantra on health care. You can watch the video if you don\u2019t believe it.\n\nAnd Obama wasn\u2019t talking about government subsidized insurance or expanding Medicaid or anything like that. He specifically focused on employer provided health care.\n\nFor \u201cpeople who already have insurance, and the employers who are providing it,\u201d he said at one campaign event, \u201cwe will work to lower your premiums by up to $2,500 per family.\u201d\n\nSo was he talking about lowering the rate of increase? It sure didn\u2019t seem that way. On CNN he said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to reduce costs an average of $2,500.\u201d\n\nEvery time the subject came up, he promised to cut premiums, not slow the rate of increase.\n\nIf what he meant was \u201cwe\u2019re going to keep the rate of increase in premiums about where it\u2019s been for several years now,\u201d he was being purposefully misleading.\n\nOf course, even if he did mean what he didn\u2019t say, Obama can\u2019t claim credit for the slowdown.\n\nThe truth is that the current trend started in 2006, long before Obama took office, and longer still before ObamaCare took effect.\n\nAnd the continued trend of modest premium increases has been due largely to the shift in the employer market toward health savings account-type plans, which just happened to hit the market in 2005.\n\nBut that\u2019s a topic for another day.\n\nFollow John Merline on Twitter @IBD_JMerline.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Employer-based health insurance premiums climbed 4.2% this year for family plans, according to an annual Kaiser Family Foundation report.
