The threat came following a mega-hack of Sony\u2019s computer system that resulted in the leak of thousands of private emails and documents as well as several unreleased films.\n\nMr. Obama had said little publicly about Sony\u2019s predicament before the studio cancelled the film, a comedy about a CIA plot to assassinate North Korea leader Kim Jong-un starring James Franco and Seth Rogen.\n\nSince then, however, the president has played the role of Monday morning quarterback, contending Friday that Sony \u201cmade a mistake\u201d and scolding the studio for bowing to pressure from North Korea, a rogue communist state that recently tested a nuclear device.\n\n\u201cWe cannot have a society in which some dictator some place can start imposing censorship here in the United States,\u201d Mr. Obama said at his end-of-year press conference, adding, \u201cI wish they\u2019d spoken to me first. I would have told them: Do not get into the pattern in which you are intimidated.\u201d\n\nBut Sony CEO Michael Lynton told CNN Friday that he had in fact sought help from the president. In an excerpt from an interview slated to air Sunday, Mr. Lynton said, \u201cI did reach out. We definitely spoke to a senior adviser in the White House to talk about the situation. The White House was certainly aware of the situation,\u201d according to Deadline Hollywood.\n\nScores of celebrities and politicians have accused Sony of cowardice for failing to go toe-to-toe with North Korea over free-speech rights. Mr. Lynton said that he had \u201cno choice\u201d after the theater chains refused to show the film, but that he was exploring other options for its release.\n\nMr. Nigam, founder of the security firm SSP Blue in Santa Monica, argued that \u201cSony is a corporation. It\u2019s not equipped to determine how to negotiate with a foreign nation-state that\u2019s declaring a war upon it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s something the White House should be standing up to, and the president should have been stronger and saying, \u2018We will not stand for somebody telling one of our companies to not release a movie. That\u2019s not how America operates,\u2019\u201d Mr. Nigam said. \u201cAs opposed to saying, \u2018Well, Sony, you made the wrong decision.\u2019\u201d\n\nConservative columnist Jonah Goldberg contrasted the current climate to that of 1940, when former New York Mayor Fiorello La Guardia assured cartoonists that, \u201cThe city of New York will see that no harm will come to you\u201d after they received threats over a drawing showing Captain America punching Adolf Hitler in the mouth.\n\n\u201cNew York Mayor Bill de Blasio didn\u2019t call the management of Landmark Theaters in New York, where Sony Pictures was slated to premiere \u2018The Interview,\u2019 and say, \u201cThe city of New York will see that no harm will come to you.\u2019 He didn\u2019t say much of anything at all,\u201d Mr. Goldberg wrote in National Review. \u201cPresident Obama did eventually say the public should \u2018go to the movies,\u2019 but that\u2019s about it.\u201d\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson described the Sony cyberattack Friday as \u201can attack on our freedom and expression and way life,\u201d and encouraged CEOs to work with the agency in beefing up their cybersecurity.\n\nOthers argue that the Sony hack stemmed from the Obama administration\u2019s lackluster track record in countering cyberattacks from foreign governments, including China, Iran and Russia.\n\nSen. John McCain, Arizona Republican, declared that, \u201cThe need for Sony Pictures to make that decision ultimately arose from the Administration\u2019s continuing failure to satisfactorily address the use of cyber weapons by our nation\u2019s enemies.\u201d\n\nHe vowed to use his platform on the Senate Armed Services Committee to \u201chold the Administration accountable for its failure to institute a meaningful strategy for combating these increasingly brazen and dangerous actions.\u201d\n\nChina expert and author Gordon G. Chang argued Friday that North Korea was emboldened by the U.S. failure to counter cyber thefts of U.S. intellectual property by foreign governments.\n\n\u201cFor two decades, the U.S. has not taken effective action against countries that have been hacking American companies for their intellectual property,\u201d Mr. Chang told FoxBusiness host Neil Cavuto. \u201cThis is the reason why North Korea saw it was pushing on an open door when it went after Sony Pictures Entertainment.\u201d\n\nMr. Chang added, \u201cSony acted like most companies would act in this situation. Yes, it was craven, but the point is that Sony doesn\u2019t have a responsibility to protect the American people. The president of the United States [does].\u201d\n\nFear in Hollywood over the specter of another hack or terrorist threat is palpable. New Regency has cancelled plans to film a North Korea-set movie starring Steve Carell, while actor George Clooney tried to drum up support for a petition in support of free speech, but nobody would sign it, Deadline Hollywood reported.\n\nThose concerns come despite a Department of Homeland Security statement Tuesday insisting that \u201cat this time there is no credible intelligence to indicate an active plot against movie theaters within the United States.\u201d\n\n\u201c[T]he administration had seen the movie months ago and had questions about the implications it could have on the North Korea regime,\u201d Mr. Nigam said. \u201cSo the moment this attack went down, knowing that the regime had already made a threat against the company, the administration should have been standing up and guiding America and guiding Hollywood and guiding the response to this, in a very public way.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cInstead of having George Clooney standing up and saying, \u2018Hey, let\u2019s fight for our rights,\u2019 it should have been the White House standing up and saying that.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Obama was quick to second-guess Sony Pictures Entertainment for its handling of the North Korean terrorist threat, which has critics asking why a movie studio has been left to conduct foreign policy instead of the White House.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "President Obama was quick to second-guess Sony Pictures Entertainment for its handling of the North Korean terrorist threat, which has critics asking why a movie studio has been left to conduct foreign policy instead of the White House.", "title": "Obama charged with throwing Sony under bus, failing to lead on terrorist threat", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/dec/20/obama-charged-throwing-sony-under-bus-failing-lead/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/12/20/4b4cd302dc32c531680f6a7067005f38.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/12/20/4b4cd302dc32c531680f6a7067005f38.jpg", "description": "President Obama was quick to second-guess Sony Pictures Entertainment for its handling of the North Korean terrorist threat, which has critics asking why a movie studio has been left to conduct foreig", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Obama charged with throwing Sony under bus, failing to lead on terrori"}, "Author": "Valerie Richardson", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Entertainment Culture, Sony Pictures Entertainment, North Korea, White House"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0e44\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThat\u2019s the job of the White House, and if anyone needs to show leadership in that area, it\u2019s the White House,\u201d he said.\nScores of celebrities and politicians have accused Sony of cowardice for failing to go toe-to-toe with North Korea over free-speech rights.\nWe definitely spoke to a senior adviser in the White House to talk about the situation.\nThe White House was certainly aware of the situation,\u201d according to Deadline Hollywood.\nThe president of the United States [does].\u201dFear in Hollywood over the specter of another hack or terrorist threat is palpable."}
