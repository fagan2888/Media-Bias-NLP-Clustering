And, of course, there are still technical problems.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut the worst is past,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was always obvious, if you knew anything about the underlying policy, that the problem was an IT problem. It was not a health care policy problem. It was just a really mismanaged piece of government contracting and that would eventually pass, that that would be fixed, and by all accounts the front-end experience is enormously improved. The back end still has problems, but those will be fixed.\u201d\n\nKrugman said that if the site had been 100 percent unworkable around Christmas time, the political damage could have undermined the entire law.\n\n\u201cBut that didn\u2019t happen,\u201d he said. \u201cSo now we\u2019re past the hump and you got Republicans out there saying, \u2018But there are other things wrong with it,\u2019 but they basically lost it and \u2026 basically health reform has won.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be OK,\u201d he said.\n\nKrugman later said that the only people who would feel \u201crate shock\u201d from increased premiums under Obamacare would be \u201cyoung, healthy and high-income\u201d Americans purchasing plans on the individual insurance market.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re really talking about a relatively small group of people who \u2026 are not the exactly the people you want to feel most sorry for,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2013\n\nFollow Becket Adams (@BecketAdams) on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30;
