Sarah Palin jumped into the \u201chashtag diplomacy\u201d debate in a Friday Facebook post, chastising the Obama administration for having Twitter take the place of action.\n\nShe wrote:\n\nDiplomacy via Twitter is the lazy, ineffectual, na\u00efve, and insulting way for America\u2019s leaders to deal with major national and international issues. It\u2019s embarrassing. Under Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton\u2019s State Department repeatedly refused to recognize Boko Haram as terrorists despite their conventional, predictable Islamic terrorist rants, training, and mission. Now, in a life or death situation, nearly 300 kidnapped Nigerian girls are in the hands of these terrorists awaiting rescue.\n\nAnd what is the Obama administration\u2019s weapon of choice in this battle for these young girls\u2019 lives? Hashtagging tweets on social media! I kinda-sorta doubt a tweet will intimidate the kidnappers much. So, if you\u2019re going to jump in and do something about these Islamic terrorists at all, then do it right, do it firmly, and kick their ass.\n\nPalin\u2019s remarks were written below a photo of an individual who wore a mocking set of hashtags on his shirt, including \u201c#HashtagsWillNotBringYourGirlsBack\u201d and \u201c#HighlyTrainedOperatorsWill.\u201d\n\nThe post is here.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "Former Alaska Gov.
