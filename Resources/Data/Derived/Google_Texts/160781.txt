Employers in the 51-100 employee size bracket are anxious about the prospect of being added to the small group market that under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) currently cuts off at 50 employees (unless states opt to raise it). Small group health plans face tougher standards under the ACA than large plans, such as having to cover the ten essential health benefits, and therefore tend to be more expensive.

Under the ACA, beginning in 2016 states would no longer have the freedom to define small group; they would have to raise it to 100 employees.
