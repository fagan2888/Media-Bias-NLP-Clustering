I scribbled down a few ideas and shared them with the group. Most of us wrote things like \u201cSMALLER CLASSES! A BIGGER BUILDING! WORKSHOPS AND SERVICES FOR PARENTS!\u201d Even \u201cINTERNET ACCESS IN THE CLASSROOM!\u201d Then, we were asked to consider how we might implement changes to address the problems without the money. We talked about using space efficiently, installing shelving on the walls, and the intent to stay organized and prepared even though there are never enough hours in the day.\n\nThe point, in retrospect, is this: Forget that time is limited. Forget cash, or the lack of it, and that American teachers spend a collective $1.6 billion a year\u2014half of the $3.2 billion spent in total\u2014supplying their classrooms with materials. You can do anything you put your mind to. But can you? Can we, teachers and administrators, create utopian learning environments through sheer force of will and innovation? Can we think our way out of inequality?\n\nNeoliberal scholars and politicos who seized upon A Nation at Risk during the late 1980s and early \u201990s to argue that American schools were globally uncompetitive and in need of a lifesaving injection of free-market principles succeeded in turning a controversial, unsubstantiated proposition into conventional wisdom almost overnight. Today many political officials, along with nearly every corporate philanthropist, take it for granted that a lack of accountability and rigor has left the education system in a state of crisis. This belief has, in turn, paved the way for those who are \u201csocially conscious\u201d but apolitical (for example, the rising figure of the \u201csocial entrepreneur\u201d) to frame education and poverty as bipartisan technical challenges in search of methodological solutions. Naturally, the solutions that spring from the minds of business school\u2013trained advocates are rather more likely than those thought up by teachers or parents or students themselves to be based on the widespread adoption of a new technology or design or habit of mind, instead of something with as high an overhead as increasing or redistributing material resources.\n\nIn their book, The Business Solution to Poverty: Designing Products and Services for Three Billion New Customers, CEO Paul Polak and Mal Warwick argue that government efforts to address poverty \u201chave not reached scale because they lack the incentives of the market to attract massive resources.\u201d One of the authors, Polak, a millionaire by way of oil and real estate, is the founder of two nonprofit organizations, International Development Enterprises and \u201cdesign incubator\u201d D-Rev, as well as a for-profit social venture called Windhorse International, whose mission is \u201cinspiring and leading a revolution in how companies design, price, market, and distribute products to benefit the 2.7 billion customers who live on less than $2 a day.\u201d Warwick is a social venture capitalist. Together they outline design principles for the creation of new products and services based on \u201cwhat [the poor] really want and need\u201d plus \u201cthe ruthless pursuit of affordability.\u201d The book won a 2014 Axiom Business Book Award and received favorable reviews from the Economist; Rajiv J. Shah, administrator for the US Agency for International Development; former Obama administration official Van Jones; and from Bill Clinton, who called it original, ambitious, and practical\u2014\u201cone of the most hopeful propositions to come along in a long time.\u201d\n\n\u201cHarness[ing] the power of free enterprise,\u201d he wrote, may \u201cbe the key to reducing the number of people in poverty on a very large scale . . . while making a profit.\u201d This is not a niche argument that appeals to a cult following, but a significant development covered regularly by Forbes, CNBC, Harvard Business Review, Fast Company, Business Week, and other denizens of the culture. Capitalism has acquired (another) new spirit: for-profit social entrepreneurs aim to \u201cdo good while making money,\u201d and corporate philanthropists expect to get a \u201creturn on investment\u201d and shape the strategy and goals of the nonprofit organizations to which they donate.\n\nIn a 2010 talk with Massachusetts Institute of Technology students, Bill Gates of Microsoft and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation\u2014ranked as the richest man in the world for sixteen of the past twenty years\u2014asked, \u201cAre the brightest minds working on the most important problems?\u201d\n\nGates\u2019s intention was to be provocative; following the assumption that \u201cdoing good\u201d and doing business are harmonious and interrelated ends, he urged students who might otherwise go into investment banking or the tech industry to consider \u201cglobal development\u201d instead. In the same talk, he identified what he sees as the two most significant issues of our time: improving the lives of the world \u2019s poorest people and improving education, encouraging future research into the technology of open source learning platforms and what makes someone a good teacher. \u201cI had no idea of how poorly the education system in the U.S. is working,\u201d he added. Gates \u201cenvisions a system that brings together the best lectures and course materials, and blends them with interactive elements and user feedback and possibly the opportunity for accreditation,\u201d reported MIT\u2019s student newspaper, the Tech.\n\nWhether or not Microsoft and Google will cop to it, every hope for and vision of the future is ideological, because progress is subjective: Imagining what it should look like and how we ought to get there requires us to make judgments about what is desirable and what is not. \u201cDesign thinking\u201d is a phenomenon embraced by the business community to determine priorities and arrive at simple, creative resolutions to the problems it has identified. Its most prominent evangelist, Tim Brown, CEO of global design company IDEO and a regular at Davos and TED talks, has described design thinking as a way to infuse \u201clocal, collaborative, participatory\u201d planning into the development of products and organizational processes. IDEO, which first became noteworthy for creating the Apple mouse, was recently hired to design an entire South American school system from the ground up.\n\nThe firm\u2019s mission to \u201ccreate impact through design\u201d encompasses consulting for private companies like health insurer Kaiser Permanente, as well as a nonprofit side\u2014 Brown sits on the board\u2014that has partnered with the Bezos Family Foundation to campaign about the importance of engaged parenting and developed an online \u201ceducational experience\u201d (funded in part by a $3 million grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation) that is now one of ten preferred institutions Walmart directs its workers to for higher education. IDEO.org \u201cpractices human-centered design to solve some of the world \u2019s most difficult problems,\u201d says the organization\u2019s home page, and \u201cworks to empower the poor.\u201d\n\nOne of those problems is, perhaps not surprisingly, education. To that end, IDEO has published an 81-page \u201cDesign Toolkit\u201d made available to teachers worldwide as a free download. It contains no physical tools but features attractive blank graphic organizers, fun neon yellow text boxes, and an array of vibrant photographs of groups of people sitting in circles surrounded by hundreds of color-coded Post-its. \u201cResponsibility\u201d is used three times in the workbook, always in reference to teachers\u2019 role to generate fixes and to develop what the firm calls \u201can evolved perspective,\u201d guided by a series of prompts. (The word \u201cfunding\u201d is used not at all\u2014nor is the word \u201cdemand.\u201d)\n\nProblems presented in floating speech bubbles range from \u201cI just can\u2019t get my students to pay attention\u201d to \u201cStudents come to school hungry and can\u2019t focus on work.\u201d All are defined as \u201copportunities\u201d for design in disguise. We\u2019re told faculty at one school embarked on a \u201cdesign journey,\u201d coming to an approach they call \u201cInvestigative Learning,\u201d which addresses students \u201cnot as receivers as information, but as shapers or knowledge\u201d\u2014without further detail as to how exactly this was accomplished.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Limiting ourselves to technical and methodological solutions to the problems in education misses the point", "title": "The business school-trained are taking on education \u2014 but what about the teachers and students?", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Limiting ourselves to technical and methodological solutions to the problems in education misses the point", "title": "The business school-trained are taking on education \u2014 but what about the teachers and students?", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/09/27/the_business_school_trained_are_taking_on_education_but_what_about_the_teachers_and_students/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/09/bill_gates2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Limiting ourselves to technical and methodological solutions to the problems in education misses the point", "title": "The business school-trained are taking on education \u2014 but what about the teachers and students?", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/09/bill_gates2.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Megan Erickson", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Bill Gates, Books, Editor's Picks, Education", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "To that end, IDEO has published an 81-page \u201cDesign Toolkit\u201d made available to teachers worldwide as a free download.\nTopics: Bill Gates, Books, Editor's Picks, Education, Innovation News, Technology News, Business NewsA year ago, at professional development training, I was asked to imagine what kind of school I would design if I had $5 million.\n\u201cI had no idea of how poorly the education system in the U.S. is working,\u201d he added.\nCan we, teachers and administrators, create utopian learning environments through sheer force of will and innovation?\n\u201cDesign thinking\u201d is a phenomenon embraced by the business community to determine priorities and arrive at simple, creative resolutions to the problems it has identified."}
