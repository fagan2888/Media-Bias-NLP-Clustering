She accused Congress of lacking the courage \u201cto vote on their conscience instead of allowing themselves to be bullied by the gun lobby.\u201d\n\nBut she noted that some states have tightened background check requirements. Connecticut already has strong gun laws, with relatively fewer gun deaths, she said.\n\nThe National Rifle Association, the nation\u2019s largest gun rights lobbying group, opposes expanding background checks. The organization says many people sent to prison because of gun crimes get their guns through theft or the black market, and no amount of background checks can stop those criminals.\n\nLegislation that sought to expand background checks to all commercial firearms sales failed to get a hearing in the U.S. House last session. With the GOP expanding its majority and winning control of the U.S. Senate, prospects for the bill may be even more unlikely this session.\n\nUnder the current system, cashiers at stores selling guns call in to check with the FBI or other designated agencies to ensure the customer doesn\u2019t have a criminal background. Some lawmakers want to expand such checks to sales at gun shows and purchases made through the Internet.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hundreds march across Brooklyn Bridge for stricter gun laws", "title": "Hundreds march across Brooklyn Bridge for stricter gun laws", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Hundreds march across Brooklyn Bridge for stricter gun laws", "title": "Hundreds march across Brooklyn Bridge for stricter gun laws", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/05/09/hundreds_march_across_brooklyn_bridge_for_stricter_gun_laws/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/gun-control-rally.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Hundreds march across Brooklyn Bridge for stricter gun laws", "title": "Hundreds march across Brooklyn Bridge for stricter gun laws", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/gun-control-rally.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Verena Dobnik", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc8e0\"", "article_summary": "Topics: From the Wires, NewsNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Hundreds of men, women and children including fashion designer Donna Karan marched across the Brooklyn Bridge on Saturday demanding stricter gun laws and offering a litany of violent stories to show why such laws are needed.\nConnecticut already has strong gun laws, with relatively fewer gun deaths, she said.\nClements said about 40 percent of all gun sales are completed without a background check.\nThe National Rifle Association, the nation\u2019s largest gun rights lobbying group, opposes expanding background checks.\nSome lawmakers want to expand such checks to sales at gun shows and purchases made through the Internet."}
