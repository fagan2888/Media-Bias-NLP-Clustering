Country music superstar George Strait will bring his "The Cowboy Rides Away Tour" to Tulsa on April 19, 2014. Strait announced Monday that he will play the BOK Center during the second leg of his final two-year tour.

Strait also revealed during a live streamed news conference that each tour date will have special guests including Jason Aldean, Eric Church, Sheryl Crow, Ronnie Dunn, Merle Haggard, Miranda Lambert, Little Big Town, Martina McBride, Lee Ann Womack, and Chris Young.

"The first leg of the tour earlier this year was very fun, but also very emotional," Strait said.



"Every city and venue holds such great memories. I'm really looking forward to seeing our fans out on the road in 2014."
