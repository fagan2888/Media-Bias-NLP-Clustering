One of the biggest newspapers in the country recently published an editorial I thought was pretty good. They said, the Republicans in Congress are poisoning Obamacare, then trying to claim it\u2019s sick. (Laughter.) That\u2019s exactly what\u2019s been happening.\n\nI mean, they have tried to put up every conceivable roadblock. They cut funding for efforts to educate people about what\u2019s in the law. Some of them said if their constituents called them, we won\u2019t even try to explain to them what\u2019s in the law. They actually opened up an investigation into people who try to help churches and charities understand how to help people sign up for the law.\n\nSome of the tea party\u2019s biggest donors \u2014 some of the wealthiest men in America \u2014 are funding a cynical ad campaign trying to convince young people not to buy health care at all. I mean, think about it. These are billionaires several times over. You know they\u2019ve got good health care.\n\nAUDIENCE: Right! (Applause.)\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: But they are actually spending money on television, trying to convince young people that if you\u2019ve got the choice between getting affordable health care or going without health care, you should choose not having any health care. Now, do you think if you get sick or you get hurt, and you get stuck with a massive bill, these same folks, they\u2019re going to help you out?\n\nAUDIENCE: No!\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Are they going to pay for your health care?\n\nAUDIENCE: No!\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: It is interesting, though, how over the last couple years, the Republican Party has just spun itself up around this issue. And the fact is the Republicans\u2019 biggest fear at this point is not that the Affordable Care Act will fail. What they\u2019re worried about is it\u2019s going to succeed. (Applause.) I mean, think about it. If it was as bad as they said it was going to be, then they could just go ahead and let it happen and then everybody would hate it so much, and then everybody would vote to repeal it, and that would be the end of it.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Charles and David Koch may own the Republican Party, but during his speech on the ACA, President Obama showed today that he owns the Kochs.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Jason Easley", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "Charles and David Koch may own the Republican Party, but during his speech on the ACA, President Obama showed today that he owns the Kochs.", "title": "Afraid of No Man or Their Money, Obama Takes Down The Koch Brothers", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2013/09/26/afraid-man-money-obama-takes-koch-brothers.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/obama-obamacare-2-1.jpg", "updated_time": "2013-09-26T15:57:40+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "Featured News,Barack Obama,Koch Brothers,koch brothers aca,obama koch brothers,Obamacare,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,hillary clinton,bernie sanders,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "Featured News", "published_time": "2013-09-26T15:57:40+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-26T15:57:40+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Barack Obama, Koch Brothers, koch brothers aca, obama koch brothers, Obamacare"}, "article_summary": "I mean, think about it.\nYou know they\u2019ve got good health care.\nTHE PRESIDENT: But they are actually spending money on television, trying to convince young people that if you\u2019ve got the choice between getting affordable health care or going without health care, you should choose not having any health care.\nCharles and David Koch may own the Republican Party, but during his speech on the ACA, President Obama showed today that he owns the Kochs.\nTHE PRESIDENT: Are they going to pay for your health care?"}
