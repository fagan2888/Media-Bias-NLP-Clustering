It\u2019s sponsored by state Sen. Michael \u201cDoc\u201d Rhett, D-Marietta.\n\nSenate Bill 368 doesn\u2019t mention the term Medicaid expansion, and its author deliberately avoided the phrase in connection to his plan.\n\nInstead, the bill calls for the state to run a \u201cpremium assistance\u2019\u2019 program for people who earn 138 percent of the federal poverty level or less. These individuals would gain private health plan coverage through the current health insurance exchange, and would be responsible for paying up to 5 percent of their income toward the cost.\n\nThe proposal hinges on the federal government agreeing to pay the same level of funding that it does under regular Medicaid expansion.\n\nMore than 30 states have pursued expansion, or a variation of it, under the Affordable Care Act. Georgia\u2019s Republican political leadership has so far stood against such a move, saying it would be too costly to the state.\n\nAs a result, though, more than 300,000 Georgians are in the so-called \u201ccoverage gap.\u2019\u2019 These people earn too much to qualify for Medicaid under current eligibility rules but not enough to earn subsidies in the health insurance exchange, created by the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThat coverage gap \u2018\u2019was one of the reasons I was intrigued by [the bill],\u2019\u2019 said Sen. Renee Unterman, R-Buford, chair of the Senate Health and Human Services Committee.\n\nRhett said he came to embrace the idea after a trip through Middle Georgia where he noticed that hospitals were a long distance away from a GPS signal.\n\nHe told the committee that his proposal could help struggling rural hospitals and economies, and also \u201cprovide health care for people who may not be able to afford it.\u201d\n\nRhett said he based his legislation on Arkansas\u2019 \u201cprivate option\u2019\u2019 plan.\n\nThrough a federal \u201cwaiver,\u2019\u2019 Arkansas is using federal funds to purchase private insurance for low-income residents unlike ordinary Medicaid expansion, which has been implemented in most states.\n\nArkansas is among the states that have had the largest reductions in their uninsured rates under the Affordable Care Act, according to several national surveys. The state has used federal money to buy coverage for more than 200,000 low-income individuals.\n\nRhett\u2019s plan would create a legislative oversight committee and begin as a pilot program under the Department of Community Health, which runs Medicaid.\n\nAt least two health plans would provide coverage in each county, \u201cto make sure no one has a monopoly,\u201d Rhett said.\n\n\u201cThis is an opportunity for people to have good health care,\u201d he said, adding that he has requested a fiscal note detailing the costs to the state for such a plan. \u201cI pretty much wanted to start the dialogue,\u201d said Rhett, an educator and a retired Air Force master sergeant.\n\nThe consumer advocacy group Georgians for a Healthy Future voiced support for the measure.\n\nEthan James of the Georgia Hospital Association told the committee that something must be done to address \u201ca crisis of the uninsured in Georgia.\u201d\n\nYet James also said his organization was committed to the current process of developing an independent study of health care access, sponsored by the Georgia Chamber of Commerce. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to rush to get this wrong,\u201d he said.\n\nAfter the hearing, Sen. Chuck Hufstetler, R-Rome, told Georgia Health News that other states had produced \u201ca lot of innovative things\u2019\u2019 in their broadening insurance access with federal funding.\n\nHe said he liked the idea of individuals paying a portion of the cost \u2014 \u201chaving skin in the game,\u2019\u2019 he said. Prevention and wellness programs can produce real savings, Hufstetler said.\n\nTim Sweeney of the Georgia Budget and Policy Institute said that the bill would \u201cuse the marketplace of plans that are out there\u2019\u2019 for expanding coverage. \u201cWe are supportive of efforts to do this.\u201d\n\n\u201cArkansas is a middle ground,\u2019\u2019 he told Georgia Health News. \u201cProvider groups have been more supportive because it builds off the private insurance world.\u201d\n\nMatt Hicks of Grady Health System said, \u201cI think hearing Senator Rhett\u2019s bill reflects an authentic concern among senators about how to ensure access to health care for the uninsured in Georgia. It is encouraging to see the Senate begin to deliberate publicly what is the best way for Georgia to transform its health care system and provide access to care for those in the coverage gap.\u201d\n\nA spokeswoman for Gov. Nathan Deal, asked about Senate Bill 368, said Wednesday that the governor does not comment on pending legislation.
