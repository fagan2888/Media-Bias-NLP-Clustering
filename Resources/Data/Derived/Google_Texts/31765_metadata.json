In a metaphor invoking the idea of House Speaker John Boehner as a Republican in drag, Levin said:\n\n[Boehner] is essentially delivering for Barack Obama everything Barack Obama wants. Just because you\u2019re dressed up as a Republican doesn\u2019t make it so\u2026 By his actions, he has demonstrated that he is not a conservative. He spends his time with [Rep. Kevin] McCarthy (R-CA) and [Rep. Steve] Scalise (R-LA) conspiring against the Tea Party and the more conservative elements of his caucus\u2026 I can\u2019t think of one significant advance in the cause of liberty or limited government under John Boehner. When he and [Sen. Mitch] McConnell (R-KY)\u2014who\u2019s equally bad\u2014 surrendered the power of the purse right out of the box\u2026 they just delivered Obama everything he wanted. So these men have helped Obama oversee the biggest explosion of government both in spending and in power ever.\n\nLevin explained that under current leadership, the Republican Party has been an abject failure:\n\nThe Republican Party is a disaster. It has lost its way, I don\u2019t think it even knows what its way is. We have a couple of self-serving powerful politicians at the top\u2014in the House, in the Senate, and in the RNC [Republican National Committee] and various other places that empower themselves, they like exercising power. And they fear conservatives more than the Democratic Party\u2026 They hate conservatives, they hate constitutionalists, they hate the Tea Party. They don\u2019t care for the Democrats, but they\u2019ll work with them\u2026 They have no strategic vision whatsoever\u2014and, of course, they have no tactical vision at all either\u2014and they keep saying, \u2018Vote Republican, Vote Republican.\u2019 But they are doing more to dispirit Republicans and conservatives than Barack Obama, because people go to the polls, they give them the House, then they give them the Senate, and they get nothing. They also seem to think that bipartisanship is the reason they\u2019re in Washington. No, the reason they\u2019re in Washington is to advance the cause of liberty and prosperity and constitutionalism. Why would you want to participate in a bipartisan government when the President of United States is openly usurping the rule of law and openly attack the private sector and individual sovereignty?\u2026 Why wouldn\u2019t you do everything you can to throw a wrench in his agenda?\n\nLevin declared that, \u201cThe Republican Party won the majority on a lie.\u201d Levin argued that on every issue from Obamacare to executive amnesty to Obamatrade, the establishment Republican Party has refused to represent the interests of Americans. Perhaps nowhere is this more acutely noticeable than on the issue of immigration. Levin explained:\n\nI\u2019m offended by this notion that if you\u2019re the child of a foreigner and you\u2019re a foreigner, that you\u2019re a \u2018DREAMer.\u2019 Do we talk about American citizen children as \u2018Dreamers\u2019?\u2026 Do you ever hear [the establishment parties] talk about young American children, or kids graduating college\u2026 and the impact that these outrageous policies have [on them]?\n\nThese observations led Levin to conclude that above all else, \u201cThe one thing the Republican Party can do is insist that its leaders resign.\u201d When asked whether he thought the efforts to oust Boehner as Speaker \u2014 such as those led by Congressman Mark Meadows (R-NC) \u2014 would prove successful, Levin was not overly optimistic:\n\nProbably not, but to me that doesn\u2019t matter. You have to start a movement, a force, an effort somewhere. If this were easy, John Boehner wouldn\u2019t be Speaker right now. I expect the entrenched Republicans to do everything they can to trash someone like Meadows\u2026 because they are protecting the system, they are part of the system, and [Meadows is] challenging it.\n\nLevin called for the emergence of \u201ca new Civil Rights movement,\u201d in which Americans insist that their leaders represent their interests. I want to generate a new Civil Rights movement, not led by hucksters, not led by liberal frauds who use that nomenclature to justify every big government agenda item that they can \u2014 the left has stolen that phrase, \u2018Civil Rights\u2019 \u2014 we need to take it back using new media, old media,using every available tactic. It\u2019s time for young people to stand up for themselves. Levin explains that his new book \u2014 whose intended readership includes both what Levin terms as the \u201cgoverning generation\u201d and the \u201crising generation\u201d\u2013 aims to \u201ccounter the textbooks that are pushing the left\u2019s agenda\u201d and \u201cundo the propaganda that media, culture, [and] professors are constantly spewing.\u201d Levin asserts that \u201cYounger people are being manipulated,\u201d and that far too many liberal-indoctrinated youths \u201care voting for their own demise.\u201d Levin hopes that with this book, he will give Americans the facts they need to generate this new Civil Rights movement and force politicians to represent their interests.\n\nPrior to his remarks, Levin sat down withand diagnosed the failings of the Republican Party \u2014 namely, that \u201cThe Republican establishment is the problem.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Mark Levin: The Republican Party Won Its Majority on a Lie", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Mark Levin: The Republican Party Won Its Majority on a Lie", "title": "Mark Levin: The Republican Party Won Its Majority on a Lie", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/01/Mark-Levin-e1422502000960.png", "height": 479}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/08/01/mark-levin-the-republican-party-won-its-majority-on-a-lie/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Mark Levin: The Republican Party Won Its Majority on a Lie", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/01/Mark-Levin-e1422502000960.png", "title": "Mark Levin: The Republican Party Won Its Majority on a Lie", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "John Boehner, Kevin McCarthy, Steve Scalese, Tea Party, Youn America's Foundation,Big Government,Mark Levin", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "Youn America's Foundation", "published_time": "2015-08-01T13:15:37-07:00", "categories": "Big Government"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcba80\"", "article_summary": "Levin explained that under current leadership, the Republican Party has been an abject failure:The Republican Party is a disaster.\nLevin declared that, \u201cThe Republican Party won the majority on a lie.\u201d Levin argued that on every issue from Obamacare to executive amnesty to Obamatrade, the establishment Republican Party has refused to represent the interests of Americans.\nPrior to his remarks, Levin sat down withand diagnosed the failings of the Republican Party \u2014 namely, that \u201cThe Republican establishment is the problem.\u201d\nLevin called for the emergence of \u201ca new Civil Rights movement,\u201d in which Americans insist that their leaders represent their interests.\nAnd they fear conservatives more than the Democratic Party\u2026 They hate conservatives, they hate constitutionalists, they hate the Tea Party."}
