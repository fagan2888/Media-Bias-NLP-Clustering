The Craig County district attorney's office charged two undersheriff's with burglary.

The DA charged Delaware County Undersheriff Justin Hendren and Craig County Undersheriff Bobby "B.J." Floyd with second-degree burglary and obstructing a police officer.

According to court documents, on March 8, 2015, Hendren, 41 and Floyd, 62, broke into the home of Hendren's estranged wife. The home is located near Vinita.

The Oklahoma Highway Patrol and the U.S. Marshal's service arrested Hendren and Floyd. They were booked into the Rogers County Jail instead of the Craig County Jail for security reasons.

Hendren was a Craig County Sheriff's Captain until May 2015 when he was appointed to the Delaware County Sheriff's Office.

Craig County District Attorney Matt Ballard began an investigation when Craig County Sheriff Jimmie Sooter sent him an incident report.Ballard also requested the OSBI investigate the Craig County Sheriff and his office, including missing evidence related to the incident.The judge set bond for both at $7,500. Second-degree burglary is a felony and obstructing an officer is a misdemeanor.





Delaware County Sheriff Harlan Moore said he's put Hendren on administrative leave pending the outcome of the case against him. He said the incident for which Hendren was charged happened before Hendren took the job with Delaware County and that Sheriff Moore didn't know about it.
