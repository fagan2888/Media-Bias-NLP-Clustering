Guess which one they picked?\n\nA study published in the journal Health Affairs found that poor residents of Arkansas, Kentucky and Texas, when asked to compare Medicaid with private coverage, said that Medicaid offered better \u201cquality of health care\u201d and made them better able to \u201cafford the health care\u201d they needed.\n\nMedicaid, the federal-state program for poor and disabled Americans, is a frequent political target, often described as substandard because of its restricted list of doctors and the red tape \u2014 sometimes even worse than no insurance at all.\n\nBut repeated surveys show that the program is quite popular among the people who use it. A 2011 survey from the Kaiser Family Foundation found that 86 percent of people who had received Medicaid benefits described the experience as somewhat or very positive. A slightly more recent Kaiser survey showed that 69 percent of Americans earning less than $40,000 a year rated the program important to them or their families.\n\nMichael Perry, a pollster at the left-leaning public opinion firm PerryUndem, has found that Medicaid tends to rank higher on satisfaction than private insurance.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s surprisingly popular,\u201d said Mollyann Brodie, Kaiser\u2019s top pollster. She\u2019s been surveying the public about attitudes on Medicaid for years and has seen the program get high marks for more than a decade. \u201cConventional wisdom is that it shouldn\u2019t be, but it actually is.\u201d\n\nStudies have also found that Medicaid rates highly among the public at large. A majority of people told Kaiser pollsters that the program was important to them and their families. That\u2019s perhaps not a surprise. Medicaid is now the country\u2019s largest health insurance program, covering some 67 million Americans. Repeated surveys have shown that a majority of Americans support the program\u2019s expansion as part of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen asked to consider it alongside other big, popular government programs, Medicaid compares favorably, said Robert Blendon, a public health professor at Harvard who studies public opinion on health care issues and was a co-author on the recent study. \u201cIt\u2019s only when you compare it to Medicare, which is so much more popular than 96 percent of what the federal government does, that it looks unimpressive,\u201d Mr. Blendon said.\n\nThe people surveyed by the Harvard researchers didn\u2019t prefer Medicaid to private insurance in every respect. They gave private coverage the edge when it came to seeing \u201cdoctors you want, without having to wait too long\u201d and \u201cto have doctors treat you with care and respect.\u201d But Medicaid came out ahead on the question of whether it enabled them to \u201cbe able to afford the health care you need,\u201d and on the overall question of \u201cquality of health care.\u201d\n\nThe results suggest that people understood that Medicaid had some drawbacks, but its affordability outweighed its inconveniences and stigma. Unlike private insurance, Medicaid does not require its beneficiaries to pay any premiums, and it allows only very small co-payments for medical services.\n\nThe Upshot In a weekly e-mail newsletter, get the best of The Upshot's analysis about politics, policy and everyday life.\n\nWhether Medicaid will remain popular is unclear. The expansion of the program may increase difficulties for beneficiaries trying to find doctors; a recent study by the inspector general of the Department of Health and Human Services raised questions about whether there would be enough providers to go around in every state. But it\u2019s also possible that Medicaid will grow even more popular as it touches more families.\n\nThe three states in the Health Affairs survey are approaching the program very differently. The Affordable Care Act gave states the opportunity to expand their programs to cover all residents below a certain income threshold. Texas declined to expand, and covers a very limited slice of its poor residents. Kentucky took up the expansion, growing its existing government-run Medicaid program. Arkansas is in the midst of a policy experiment; instead of a typical expansion, the state is using Medicaid money to give low-income residents access to private insurance plans on the new insurance marketplace.\n\nBut low-income residents of all three states viewed the program similarly \u2014 about 80 percent of those surveyed in each state supported expansion of the program. And there was no major difference in the proportion that favored Medicaid or private coverage \u2014 in Arkansas, more people still preferred Medicaid to a private plan over all.\n\n\u201cThe political realities were not very relevant to these people,\u201d said Dr. Benjamin Sommers, an assistant professor of health policy and economics and one of the paper\u2019s co-authors.\n\nAnd that mismatch may explain the divergence between the program\u2019s popularity and its political image: Though low-income Americans value Medicaid, they\u2019re not that likely to vote on it. Here\u2019s another question to which the answers looked the same in all three states: Is your state going to expand Medicaid? Between a quarter and a third of people in all three states answered yes, even though two states were expanding, and one was not.\n\n\u201cThe bulk of the respondents didn\u2019t know there was a Medicaid expansion, which means these people aren\u2019t voters,\u201d Mr. Blendon said. \u201cMost of them support an expansion, even though they didn\u2019t know there was an expansion. Politically, that\u2019s just not a powerful force.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20141009070207, "twitter": {"description": "Results of surveys suggest that people understand Medicaid\u2019s drawbacks but appreciate its advantages.", "title": "Medicaid, Often Criticized, Is Quite Popular With Its Customers", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/10/upshot/medicaid-often-criticized-is-quite-popular-with-its-customers.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003165413"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "creator": "sangerkatz", "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/10/09/upshot/10UP-Medicaid/10UP-Medicaid-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/10/upshot/medicaid-often-criticized-is-quite-popular-with-its-customers.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003165413", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/10/upshot/medicaid-often-criticized-is-quite-popular-with-its-customers.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "upshot", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/upshot/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Oct. 9, 2014", "edt": "The New York Times on the Web", "org": "Health Affairs (Journal)", "keywords": "Medicaid,Polls and Public Opinion,Health Affairs (Journal),Health Insurance and Managed Care,Arkansas,Texas,Kentucky", "news_keywords": "Medicaid,Arkansas,Texas,Kentucky", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Margot Sanger-Katz", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/10/09/upshot/10UP-Medicaid/10UP-Medicaid-thumbLarge.jpg", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "byl": "By MARGOT SANGER-KATZ", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "Results of surveys suggest that people understand Medicaid\u2019s drawbacks but appreciate its advantages.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/10/09/upshot/10UP-Medicaid/10UP-Medicaid-thumbStandard.jpg", "description": "Results of surveys suggest that people understand Medicaid\u2019s drawbacks but appreciate its advantages.", "CG": "upshot", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Oct. 9, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/s/margot_sangerkatz/index.html", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/upshot", "section": "The Upshot", "modified": "2015-08-24", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/upshot/index.jsonp", "tag": "Kentucky", "published": "2014-10-09", "section-taxonomy-id": "D64FAE4C-4425-4E5A-B898-6C8CB59F9957"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "geo": "Kentucky", "slug": "10up-medicaid", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20150824162655, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/10/upshot/medicaid-often-criticized-is-quite-popular-with-its-customers.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/10/09/upshot/10UP-Medicaid/10UP-Medicaid-videoSixteenByNine1050.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Results of surveys suggest that people understand Medicaid\u2019s drawbacks but appreciate its advantages.", "title": "Medicaid, Often Criticized, Is Quite Popular With Its Customers"}, "pdate": 20141009, "des": "Health Insurance and Managed Care", "articleid": 100000003165413, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Medicaid, Often Criticized, Is Quite Popular With Its Customers", "col": "Public Health", "PST": "News"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThe bulk of the respondents didn\u2019t know there was a Medicaid expansion, which means these people aren\u2019t voters,\u201d Mr. Blendon said.\nUnlike private insurance, Medicaid does not require its beneficiaries to pay any premiums, and it allows only very small co-payments for medical services.\nMedicaid is now the country\u2019s largest health insurance program, covering some 67 million Americans.\nThe people surveyed by the Harvard researchers didn\u2019t prefer Medicaid to private insurance in every respect.\nLow-income people in three Southern states were recently asked whether they preferred Medicaid or private insurance."}
