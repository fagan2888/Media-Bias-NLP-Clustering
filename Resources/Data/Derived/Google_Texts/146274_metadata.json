This species is considered one of the most serious of the world\u2019s fruit fly pests due to its potential economic harm.\n\nThe initial fly was discovered during routine trapping, and additional flies were discovered during expanded trapping activities. The department, along with the U.S. Department of Agriculture, monitors more than 56,000 fruit fly traps throughout Florida as an early detection network against exotic fruit fly introductions that threaten Florida\u2019s agriculture industry.\n\n\u201cThough disturbing, this find confirms that our early detection system for pests and disease is among the best in the nation,\u201d said Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam. \u201cWe are working closely with our federal partners to eradicate this destructive pest in order to protect Florida\u2019s $120 billion agriculture industry.\u201d\n\nThe fly has been trapped several times in Florida since 1964, and each time it has been successfully eradicated. It attacks more than 230 different fruits, vegetables and nuts, including avocado, fig, grapefruit, guava, loquat, mango, roseapple, papaya, peach, persimmon, Surinam cherry and white sapote. The fruit flies lay their eggs in host fruits and vegetables.\n\nTo eradicate this pest, treatment is being conducted in a 1.5-square-mile area around the fly detections. This treatment consists of attracting male flies to bait which consists of an attractant, an insecticide, and a thickening agent. The flies are killed when they feed on the bait. The bait mixture is applied weekly to upper portions of telephone and utility poles. The application will continue for one life cycle of the fly, which is approximately 90 days.", "article_metadata": {"description": "More than 40 Oriental fruit flies found in Miami-Dade County.
