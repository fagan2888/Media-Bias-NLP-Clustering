Planned Parenthood Action Fund of New Jersey analyzed its own data and statistics from the Health Department between 2009 and 2014, the latest available. The group said budget cuts by Gov. Chris Christie are fueling the public health crisis.\n\n\u201cBack in 2010, Gov. Christie eliminated funding for family planning services from the New Jersey state budget. So this was a $7.5 million line item that went to vital preventative services, including breast and cervical cancer screenings, birth control and testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections, including HIV/AIDS,\u201d said Planned Parenthood Action Fund of New Jersey Communications Manager Casey Olesko.\n\nRepresentatives here say that the organization has had to close down six health clinics in the state and curtail services and office hours at 14 others as a result of the budget cuts.\n\nSTD rates are also up nationally, according to the Centers for Disease Control. Dr. Mark Martens is an OBGYN at Jersey Shore University Medical Center, and a former medical director for Planned Parenthood in Arkansas and Oklahoma. He sees another reason for the increase.\n\n\u201cOverall it\u2019s the decrease in the amount of times that a woman\u2019s health provider, whether it\u2019s a doctor or nurse practitioner, sees a young woman,\u201d he said. \u201cWe used to check pap smears on all women as soon as up to three years after they started having sex. The new recommendations are not to test anyone below 21, so we don\u2019t catch most of the STDs. Half of the STDs are in women younger than 21.\u201d\n\nAnd, he says, half are detected during annual visits. Women are more likely than men to have an STD and not know it because the symptoms aren\u2019t as severe. So while delayed testing is a boon for health care savings, Dr. Martens says it\u2019s not doing patients any favors.\n\nThe state Department of Health said in an email that the governor\u2019s decision to expand Medicaid through federal funding for the Affordable Care Act has benefited thousands of previously uninsured women. And that Christie\u2019s most recent budget proposal includes $10.8 million for cancer screenings and $4.1 million for STD screening, education and clinical care. That\u2019s a $600,000 increase over the current year\u2019s budget.\n\nIn total, that\u2019s $28 million for community health centers, including those that offer reproductive health services. The Health Department says more than 240,000 women \u2014 many of them low-income \u2014 are visiting the centers. And that number is growing.\n\n\u201cHowever, Planned Parenthood is the go-to, the most common clinic that women know about, so there\u2019s going to need to be a lot of extra education in order to direct these women to these clinics if they\u2019re going to rely on those to find these diseases,\u201d Martens said.\n\nHe says with access to good antibiotics and good diagnostics, STD rates should be going down, not up.\n\nFollow @ErinDelmoreNJTV", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "pubdate": 20160420, "og": {"site_name": "NJTV News", "description": "STD rates are increasing in New Jersey, in part due to a change in funding that has caused many health centers to close, but also from a delay in young women being tested because of new recommendations.
