That may or may not be the case, but it\u2019s certainly true that pound for pound there are way more songs about God than about his adversary. Still, Satan has inspired a legion of melodies. To do this as it should be done, I should probably list 666 of them, but even my patience doesn\u2019t extend that far (to say nothing of my editor\u2019s). So the number of the beast in this case is 18, unless you want to list another 648 in comments.\n\nShelley Faulkner and Hildegard von Bingen, \u201cSed Diabolus\u201d\n\nHildegard von Bingen has been subjected to some unfortunate New Age renditions, but this is a pleasingly low-fi setting for voice, cello and recorder. There are three songs here; the middle one is \u201cSed Diabolus,\u201d or \u201cOnly the Devil Laughed.\u201d It\u2019s part of a cycle dedicated to St. Ursula, who was slaughtered along with thousands of accompanying virgins after making a pilgrimage to Rome. \u201cSed Diabolus\u201d is thought to be the conclusion, in which the devil, \u201cwho would leave no work of God intact and undiminished,\u201d sneers and jibes at Ursula. It seems a bit odd that a saint like Hildegard would let Satan get the last word, but perhaps she was feeling especially pessimistic that day. It can happen to the best of us.\n\nSeldom Scene, \u201cSatan\u2019s Choir\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a long bluegrass gospel tradition of warning listeners off Satan. The most famous example is probably the Louvin Brothers\u2019 \u201cSatan Is Real,\u201d but this 1993 track from the Seldom Scene is also a worthy entry in the genre. The singing doesn\u2019t sound exactly demonic, though I suppose the devil could conceivably be taken with the affectless chill of bluegrass harmonies.\n\nAlex Bradford, \u201cDon\u2019t Let Satan Turn You Round\u201d\n\nDour country singers wail about the devil all the time, but Old Nick is noticeably absent from the African-American gospel tradition. This Alex Bradford track from (I believe) the early \u201950s bucks the trend, even if the group here musters more confidence about beating the devil than the Seldom Scene manage. Certainly no one whose soul was damned could manage the hearty \u201coooooh\u201d that Bradford lets rip around the :50-second mark (and if you think Bradford recalls Little Richard there, it\u2019s because they\u2019re both imitating the great Marion Williams).\n\nGeorge Jones, \u201cTake the Devil out of Me\u201d\n\nThis is one of Jones\u2019 early career Mercury tracks from the mid-to-late \u201950s, straddling the line between rockabilly and honky-tonk. Jones\u2019 hiccupping yodel here gives you the impression the devil and Jesus are in fact wrestling in his larynx \u2014 a glottal struggle over that demon drink, perhaps.\n\nIJenNeh, \u201cSatan Fall Down\u201d\n\nA blind gospel performer from Liberia, IJenNeh offers a casually chipper challenge to the forces of darkness in \u201cSatan Fall Down.\u201d There\u2019s none of the warbling uncertainty you get in George Jones\u2019 performance here. Instead the dancers boogie and shake with blithe enthusiasm, as if every step is squishing an adversary underfoot.\n\nBill and Belle Reed, \u201cOld Lady & the Devil\u201d\n\nThe devil in this song wishes that some mild trampling was the worst he had to suffer. You can read \u201cOld Lady & the Devil\u201d as cheerful misogyny or cheerful empowerment, but either way, the old lady in question gets to go to hell, murder various devils and then bash her husband for trying to get rid of her in the first place. To this day, no doubt, the devil fears those terrifying syllables, \u201cFaaa-dita-la-dita-la-Faaa-dita-la-dita-la-daaay.\u201d (If you listen carefully you can hear the priest repeat them in \u201cThe Exorcist.\u201d No fooling.)\n\nRobert Johnson, \u201cMe and the Devil Blues\u201d\n\nOne of several Johnson tunes about dealing with the devil. This one seems almost like a reply to the Bill and Belle Reed track; instead of the old lady beating the devil, the devil helps him beat his woman. Not especially enlightened, but the guy does die, so perhaps that\u2019s retribution of a sort. Johnson is generally celebrated for his guitar work, but his singing is perhaps just as striking, shooting up into falsetto moans, part spooky, part celebratory, part mimicking the squeal of that Greyhound bus that incongruously gets his soul at the end.\n\nRex Allen, \u201cTying a Knot in the Devil\u2019s Tail\u201d\n\nOne of the more popular musical cowboys in the Roy Rogers mold, Allen subjects Satan to a series of cruel indignities, as fruity cowboys bearing accordions, of all things, rope and tie the poor bugger. As Allen says, the \u201cgut line is coiled up neat,\u201d the violent humiliation (including branding) delivered with a tidy, forthright, avuncular aplomb. Don\u2019t trifle with cowboys, Satan, especially if they\u2019re drunk and singing.\n\nLyle Lovett, \u201cFriend of the Devil\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve always had an ambivalent relationship with the Grateful Dead\u2019s \u201cFriend of the Devil\u201d \u2014 the hook is great but the delivery is so thin, watery and half-assed it takes much of the pleasure out of it. Lyle Lovett\u2019s cover is a relief. With the cello and the vocals vying to see who can slow down most, Lovett comes across as world-weary enough to be a passing acquaintance of the evil one. (Surely if they were close friends, Satan would have talked to him about that hair.)", "article_metadata": {"description": "These catchy tunes make the case for the dark side VIDEO", "title": "The 18 best songs about the devil", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "These catchy tunes make the case for the dark side VIDEO", "title": "The 18 best songs about the devil", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/01/25/the_18_best_songs_about_the_devil/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/snoop_dogg.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "These catchy tunes make the case for the dark side VIDEO", "title": "The 18 best songs about the devil", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/snoop_dogg.jpg", "creator": "@hoodedu", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Noah Berlatsky", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, devil, devil songs, Music, Satan, Video", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc32c\"", "article_summary": "Topics: devil, devil songs, Music, Satan, Video, Entertainment NewsIt\u2019s often said that the Devil has the best tunes.\nThis one seems almost like a reply to the Bill and Belle Reed track; instead of the old lady beating the devil, the devil helps him beat his woman.\nBill and Belle Reed, \u201cOld Lady & the Devil\u201dThe devil in this song wishes that some mild trampling was the worst he had to suffer.\nRobert Johnson, \u201cMe and the Devil Blues\u201dOne of several Johnson tunes about dealing with the devil.\nSo the number of the beast in this case is 18, unless you want to list another 648 in comments."}
