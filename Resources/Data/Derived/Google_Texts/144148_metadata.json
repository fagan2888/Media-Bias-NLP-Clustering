Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) isn\u2019t letting him off the hook. As one of his final acts as chairman of the powerful House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, he issued a subpoena Thursday demanding that Gruber hand over all documents and communications with government officials related to his work on the health-care law.\n\n\u201cAs one of the architects of Obamacare, Jonathan Gruber is a unique position to shed light on the \u2018lack of transparency\u2019 surrounding the passage of the president\u2019s health-care law,\u201d Issa said in a statement Friday. \u201cThe American people deserve not just an apology, but a full accounting, which Mr. Gruber must provide.\u201d\n\n\n\nRep.

(Cliff Owen/AP)\n\nThe Obama administration paid Gruber, an economist with the prestigious Massachusetts Institute of Technology, about $400,000 for a system to help predict how the Congressional Budget Office would score the Affordable Care Act. CBO scoring, or quantifying the financial impacts of a bill, can be a major factor in determining whether legislation passes or fails.\n\nGruber said at a forum several years ago that the creators of the health-care legislation used \u201ctortured language\u201d to keep parts of the measure from being scored as tax increases. He added that \u201clack of transparency is a huge political advantage\u201d because of \u201cthe stupidity of the American voter.\u201d\n\nAt a hearing with the oversight committee Tuesday, Gruber said his comments were out of line, explaining that he made \u201cuninformed and glib\u201d remarks about the political process behind the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cI am not an expert on politics, and my tone implied that I was, which is wrong,\u201d Gruber said. \u201cIt is never appropriate to try to make oneself seem more important or smarter by demeaning others. \u2026 I am embarrassed and I am sorry.\u201d\n\nGruber did not immediately respond to an e-mail requesting a response to the subpoena Friday afternoon. A call to his office was not answered.\n\nIt is unclear whether Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) will decide to enforce the subpoena once he succeeds Issa as chairman of the oversight committee in January. His office did not immediately respond to a request for an answer Friday afternoon.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The MIT economist declined at a hearing this week to answer questions about how much the Obama administration paid him for work on Obamacare.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/jadam.hicks", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The MIT economist declined at a hearing this week to answer questions about how much the Obama administration paid him for work on Obamacare.", "title": "Issa subpoenas MIT economist Jonathan Gruber for Obamacare documents", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/federal-eye/wp/2014/12/12/issa-subpoenas-mit-economist-jonathan-gruber-for-obamacare-documents/", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=http://img.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/files/http://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_908w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/12/09/Editorial-Opinion/Images/205733974.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@reporter_hicks"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/federal-eye/wp/2014/12/12/issa-subpoenas-mit-economist-jonathan-gruber-for-obamacare-documents/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "fedpagehero; jonathan gruber; gruber obamacare; stupid voters; mit jonathan gruber; obamacare jonathan gruber; jonathan gruber obamacare; gruber obamacare; gruber; federal news; federal eye; federal government; obama administration; obamacare; affordable care act; white house; president obama; washington post; josh hicks; darrell issa;", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/jadam.hicks"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "fedpagehero; jonathan gruber; gruber obamacare; stupid voters; mit jonathan gruber; obamacare jonathan gruber; jonathan gruber obamacare; gruber obamacare; gruber; federal news; federal eye; federal government; obama administration; obamacare; affordable care act; white house; president obama; washington post; josh hicks; darrell issa;"}, "article_summary": "\u201cAs one of the architects of Obamacare, Jonathan Gruber is a unique position to shed light on the \u2018lack of transparency\u2019 surrounding the passage of the president\u2019s health-care law,\u201d Issa said in a statement Friday.\nIt is unclear whether Rep.
