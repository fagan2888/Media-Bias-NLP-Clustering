Charles Krauthammer on 'The Kelly File' - 11/14/13: "This is the usual lawlessness you expect from this administration. Remember just a few weeks ago he unilaterally decided to suspend the employer mandate. He has no right to do that. The executive carries out the law. The constitution is very clear. Congress passes the law, congress amends the law. But he’s done it now so many times that it’s like the air we breathe, hardly anyone notices."
