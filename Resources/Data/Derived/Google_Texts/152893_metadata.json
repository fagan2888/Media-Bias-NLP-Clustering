I had the best,\u201d said Perkins, who added that he \u201cloves\u201d his Kaiser doctors. \u201cAccording to our president, and everybody that was a part of the ACA, people who had insurance would only be kicked off their plan if it was insufficient,\u201d he said in frustration.\n\nThe alternative offered by Kaiser will cost Perkins $6,000 more a year and have spending limits, something his old plan did not.\n\nIn their letter, Kaiser said, \u201cUnder the ACA and California regulations, beginning January 1, 2014, small businesses must have at least one \u2018common law\u2019 employee who isn\u2019t the owner or owner\u2019s spouse (or domestic partner) to be eligible for small group coverage.\u201d\n\nGone from coverage, added Kaiser: \u201cOwner-only business\u201d and \u201cHusband/wife business.\u201d\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just in California. Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Jersey has this warning on their webpage: \u201cSole proprietors with no employees (or whose only employee is a spouse) are not eligible to purchase coverage through SHOP. To be considered a group health plan, the plan must have employees among its participants. In determining if a group health plan exists, federal law does not classify an individual and his or her spouse as employees when the trade or business is wholly-owned by the individual or by the individual and his or her spouse. When a sole proprietor and/or a spouse-employee are the only enrolled employees, the health plan is not considered a group health plan.\u201d\n\nPerkins said that even if he had employees, Kaiser would have cancelled his plan unless the workers were also on his gold-plated policy.\n\n\u201cTo be honest, I am livid,\u201d said Perkins. \u201cOur president stated, \u2018You can keep your health plan and your doctors,\u2019 Turns out that was a complete lie. Our president, when caught in this lie, then goes into damage control and states, \u2018The reason why people are losing their health plans is because they are inadequate.' This also turns out to be a complete lie.\u201d\n\nPaul Bedard, the Washington Examiner's \"Washington Secrets\" columnist, can be contacted at pbedard@washingtonexaminer.com.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Dwight \u201cBone Daddy\u201d Perkins never saw the Obamacare punch coming.\nThe owner of a husband/wife beverage company in California, Perkins had the best and most expensive Kaiser Permanente small group plan available.
