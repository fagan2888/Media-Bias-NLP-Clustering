The state law establishing the Healthy Michigan program requires the waiver's OK by year's end or else the Medicaid expansion will end.\n\n\n\nPrior to the Medicaid expansion, said Suzin Greenway of White Oak Township, she was one of the many who fell through the cracks - earning too much to qualify for regular Medicaid but too little to qualify for subsidies on the Health Insurance Marketplace. Greenway, a farmer's market manager and cancer survivor, said Healthy Michigan has been nothing short of life changing.\n\n\n\n\"Should Michigan repeal expanded Medicaid in the future, I would live a very different life,\" she said, \"one in fear of slipping and falling in winter, bee stings, deteriorating health, further skin cancer and more.\"\n\n\n\nUnder Medicaid expansion, which took effect in April 2014 and is part of the Affordable Care Act, the federal government pays 100 percent of the costs. Starting in 2017, states will begin paying a small portion of the costs, which will be capped at 10 percent in 2020.\n\n\n\nThe study is online at familiesusa.org.\n\nMona Shand, Public News Service - MI", "article_metadata": {"description": "LANSING, Mich. - They wait tables, build homes, care for loved ones and ring up purchases - and according to a new report, they make up the majority of enrollees in the Healthy Michigan program, the future of which currently is at stake.
