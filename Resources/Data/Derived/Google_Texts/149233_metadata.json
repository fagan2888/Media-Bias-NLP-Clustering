The requirement applies to establishments that operate 20 or more restaurants, and it applies to alcoholic beverages listed on menus, but not those ordered at the bar.\n\nNew rules from the Food and Drug Administration will require restaurants with 20 or more outlets to list the amount of calories in alcoholic drinks on menus. (Larry Crowe/AP)\n\nThe rule applies to the restaurants that serve the alcohol \u2014 and not the beverage manufacturers that make it. Still, the wine association wants to make sure restaurants do not ask wineries to provide them with exact calorie counts, but rather accept estimated ranges of calories based on alcohol content, Kaiser said.\n\nThat would mean, for example, wineries could disclose that a 5-ounce glass of wine with 13 percent alcohol has between 130 and 140 calories, as opposed to testing to find the exact calorie count for every specific wine.\n\nThe wine association is also lobbying the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau, which regulates the labeling of alcoholic beverages, to keep the disclosure of nutritional information on wine labels voluntary. A bureau rule finalized in 2007 would have made the labeling mandatory, but it has not become a permanent rule.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Trade group for wine industry wants FDA to allow wineries to provide calorie estimates, not specifics.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=1216470", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Trade group for wine industry wants FDA to allow wineries to provide calorie estimates, not specifics.", "title": "Wineries want flexibility in disclosure of calories", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/capitalbusiness/trade-group-for-wine-industry-lobbyies-on-new-fda-calorie-rule/2015/01/09/254905a4-95da-11e4-aabd-d0b93ff613d5_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/12/17/Production/Health/Images/Calories_on_Menus_Alcohol-09f73.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@WapoCat"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/capitalbusiness/trade-group-for-wine-industry-lobbyies-on-new-fda-calorie-rule/2015/01/09/254905a4-95da-11e4-aabd-d0b93ff613d5_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "capbiznews, wine regulations, WineAmerica, FDA calorie rule, nutritional content, wine industry", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=1216470"}, "eomportal-uuid": "254905a4-95da-11e4-aabd-d0b93ff613d5", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "capbiznews, wine regulations, WineAmerica, FDA calorie rule, nutritional content, wine industry"}, "article_summary": "U.S. winemakers are concerned that a new Food and Drug Administration rule requiring restaurants to post calorie counts for food and alcohol may become costly for vintners that provide wine to chain restaurants.\nA bureau rule finalized in 2007 would have made the labeling mandatory, but it has not become a permanent rule.\nIt costs about $500 per wine to conduct testing for detailed calorie information, said Michael Kaiser, director of public affairs for WineAmerica.\n(Larry Crowe/AP)The rule applies to the restaurants that serve the alcohol \u2014 and not the beverage manufacturers that make it.\n\u201cIt\u2019s cost and time.\u201dThe new FDA rule is part of the Affordable Care Act, and it went into effect Dec. 1."}
