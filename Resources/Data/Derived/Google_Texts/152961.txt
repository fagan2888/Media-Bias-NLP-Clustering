Jeremy Sumner was arrested after showing up to a Yukon residence for sex with an undercover deputy posing as a 14-year-old girl.

An Oklahoma man was arrested for child sex crimes after communicating with an undercover Canadian County sheriff's deputy posing as a 14-year-old Yukon girl.

It all began Wednesday afternoon when a deputy monitored a public website posing as a 14-year-old eighth grade girl. According to the investigation, the deputy was almost immediately approached by 38-year-old Jeremy Sumner of Stratford, Okla.

The deputy said Sumner began asking the “girl” if she had ever had sex before. The deputy responded “no” and said she did not know if she should. Sumner replied that he would “walk her through” it and be “gentle”. He then sent photos of his erect penis to the deputy.

When the deputy agreed to meet with Sumner, Sumner began asked for the address and also about the whereabouts of her parents. The deputy told Sumner that she only lived with her mom, and that her mom was working the late shift at the hospital.

With that information, Sumner traveled to Yukon to meet a person that he believed was a 14-year-old girl. He requested that she answer the door in nothing but a lime green bath towel, and continued a lengthy conversation with the undercover deputy, describing in detail the sexual acts he was going to perform.

Sumner was immediately arrested upon arrival. He had five condoms in his possession as well as his cell phone with the entire conversation that he had with the undercover deputy. According to the report, Sumner gave investigators an entire confession, he also admitted to knowing her age and described to investigators what all he was going to do to her had she been a real person.

Sumner was booked into the Canadian County Jail where he remains on a $550,000 bond.
