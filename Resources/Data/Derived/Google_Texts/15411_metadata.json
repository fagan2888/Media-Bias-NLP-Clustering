The next big thing is the health-centric home.\n\nFrom actual at-home hospitals to wellness and fitness amenities, there\u2019s no limit to how far celebrities and the super rich will go to make sure they stay young and healthy.\n\nThere were rumors Wednesday that Kim Kardashian and Kanye West plan to build a $3 million at-home medical facility, with an X-ray machine and CT scanner, mainly to serve their daughter\u2019s medical needs.\n\nSLIDESHOW: 10 Outrageously Pimped-Out Homes of the Super Rich\n\nFor most people though, the health-centric home starts in the bathroom, where one of the biggest trends is the vitamin C-infused showers, which removes the chlorine from the water and supposedly helps improve dry and itchy skin. Celebrities including Leonardo DiCaprio have one, and you can get yours on Amazon for less than $100.\n\n\u201cThe showers just seem to be getting bigger and have multiple shower heads,\u201d said Jason Wilson, who manages the Julia B. Fee Sotheby\u2019s International Realty Scarsdale office. \u201cPeople still want a bath tub but they put more emphasis on the shower. You\u2019re seeing a lot of steam showers too.\u201d\n\nIn DiCaprio\u2019s new Greenwich Village apartment, which he purchased last month for $10 million, there\u2019s also a circulated aromatherapy air supply and posture-supportive heat reflexology flooring. The apartment is one of five units in the building, which was developed by Delos, a real estate firm focused on wellness real estate.\n\nThat\u2019s not all. Luxury homebuilders in Los Angeles are also creating homes that serve their customers\u2019 health.\n\nA $65-million spec house in Beverly Crest includes a Botox station and a dental chair, according to a Los Angeles Times article. Architect Doug Burdge has designed homes in Malibu with wellness suites where hairdressers, fitness trainers and masseuses can come to the home out of sight of paparazzi. NBA player Jason Terry\u2019s Atlanta home, which is on the market for $1.89 million, has its own in-house barbershop and beauty salon.\n\nClick here to see the 10 over-the-top home luxuries for the super rich.\n\nMeanwhile designer Kenneth Bordewick has created a fully equipped intensive-care unit in one home so CEOs and other influential businessmen can be treated away from paparazzi, according to the same Los Angeles Times article. \u201cIf the owner goes to the hospital, the stock market could crash and a company may flounder,\u201d Bordewick said.\n\nGyms have become ubiquitous in rich people\u2019s homes and there\u2019s more to staying healthy now including basketball courts, squash courts, bowling alleys and golf simulators.\n\nThere\u2019s change happening with swimming pools too. On one hand, Wilson noted that indoor swimming pools are disappearing because of the mold problems and health issues they create for residents. On the other hand, homeowners have become more creative with the design of their pool, like this Stradivarius violin-shaped pool.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "From actual at-home hospitals to wellness and fitness amenities, there\u2019s no limit to how far celebrities and the superrich are going to make sure they stay young and healthy.", "title": "The New Luxury for the Super Rich: Health-Centric Homes", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/06/25/New-Luxury-Super-Rich-Health-Centric-Homes", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/Water_Slide_Home_Luxuries.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/06/25/New-Luxury-Super-Rich-Health-Centric-Homes", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/Water_Slide_Home_Luxuries.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "From actual at-home hospitals to wellness and fitness amenities, there\u2019s no limit to how far celebrities and the superrich are going to make sure they stay young and healthy.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca1ec\"", "article_summary": "Luxury homebuilders in Los Angeles are also creating homes that serve their customers\u2019 health.\nA $65-million spec house in Beverly Crest includes a Botox station and a dental chair, according to a Los Angeles Times article.\nGyms have become ubiquitous in rich people\u2019s homes and there\u2019s more to staying healthy now including basketball courts, squash courts, bowling alleys and golf simulators.\nFrom actual at-home hospitals to wellness and fitness amenities, there\u2019s no limit to how far celebrities and the super rich will go to make sure they stay young and healthy.\nMeanwhile designer Kenneth Bordewick has created a fully equipped intensive-care unit in one home so CEOs and other influential businessmen can be treated away from paparazzi, according to the same Los Angeles Times article."}
