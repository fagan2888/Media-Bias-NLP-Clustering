Players who have played together for years, some long before high school, taking the field as a team for the final time.\n\nThat final game coming Saturday afternoon in the 5A State Championship game against the same Archbishop McCarthy team that beat Mosley in the title game in 2013!\n\nSenior lefty JJ Bleday getting his first start since mid-April, on the hill for Mosley. The Mavericks get to him in the bottom of the first, Alex Toral with the rbi single through the right side drives in a run, it's 1-0.\n\nThat first inning threatened to get much worse when the next hitter lined a ball to deep center. Mosley centerfielder Peyton Millirons went back, made a terrific over the shoulder catch, literally snaring the ball out of the air. He then turned and fired back to first to double off Toral to end the inning.\n\nThe Dolphins offense looked to answer that first inning run by loading up the bases with one out against against McCarthy starter Christian Demby. Demby gets Gunner Smith to pop out and Jordan Murray's soft liner didn't have enough on it to clear the infield, it was caught by the shortstop to end that threat.\n\nIn the bottom of the 4th, Toral led off the inning with a double. Two hitters later, with men at second and third, Ubaldo Lopez flies out to left. Toral scores easily from third. Then, seemingly with time called, the other McCarthy runner takes third.\n\nMosley head coach Todd Harless approached the umpire to talk about that, but by all accounts, before Harless really got anywhere close to the home plate umpire, that ump ejected Harless. The Mosley coach then began vociferously arguing about that. Eventually, after another umpire and Mosley's A.D. Josh Vandergrift and Mosley's SRO pulled the coach away. Harless was forced the leave the stadium!\n\nThe Mosley offense unable to get on the board in the 5th and 6th. Then in the bottom of the 6th, after a lightning delay of well over an hour, McCarthy was able to put up one more run. The Mavericks would hold on to win with a 3-0 shutout. So for the second time in three seasons, Mosley's title dream ends at the hands of McCarthy.\n\nMosley's final record winds up at 28-4.\n\nAfter the game it was a very emotional scene as the Mosley players went outside the stadium to hand the runner up medal to their coach, who very likely was coaching the team for the final time.\n\nAs for that bizarre ejection, coach Harless telling Greg as he approached the umpire, it was the ump who said something out of line.\n\n\"You know you see my reaction after he says something, and I'm like whoa and that's when he throws me out. And I was in shock that he said what he said. And he thought that I had said something, and even what he thought I said, Greg, was not an ejectable offense. In no way, no how did I get said if you say another word, go back to the dugout or you're getting thrown out. I mean that what you expect in a state championship game, or any game.\"\n\n\"Everything's gotta come to an end.\" senior Dillon Brown said. \"It's bittersweet, but I took it as far as I could take it. Played as many games as anybody in the state of Florida could play in their senior year. So to make it to the end is awesome.\"\n\n\"I mean being able to compete in the state championship, you can't explain it in words.\" said junior JJ Bleday. \"All you can say is all that hard work paid off. And we actually got there. Even though we didn't win it, you know win as a team, lose as a team. It is what it is. It was a fun season.\"\n\n\"These kids tonight when they came out here,\" said Harless \"I'm sure you got film of it, a grown man like me was out here crying. Because I love every one of them. They're my kids and it hurt me seeing them cry and upset. It truly hurts me.\"\n\nHarless is expected to be named a middle school principal sometime next week, and that will make his continuing to coach the program next to impossible.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Fort Myers, FL---The Mosley Dolphins unable to get over the McCarthy hurdle, lose in 5A Championship game 3-0.", "language": "english", "author": "Scott Rossman", "og": {"url": "http://www.wjhg.com/sports/headlines/Dolphns-Fall-In-5A-Title-Game-3-0-Saturday-304018231.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/7mosleyrunnerup.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Fort Myers, FL---The Mosley Dolphins unable to get over the McCarthy hurdle, lose in 5A Championship game 3-0.", "title": "Dolphins Fall In 5A Title Game 3-0 Saturday"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.wjhg.com", "description": "Fort Myers, FL---The Mosley Dolphins unable to get over the McCarthy hurdle, lose in 5A Championship game 3-0.", "title": "Dolphins Fall In 5A Title Game 3-0 Saturday", "url": "http://www.wjhg.com/sports/headlines/Dolphns-Fall-In-5A-Title-Game-3-0-Saturday-304018231.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/7mosleyrunnerup.jpg", "creator": "@WJHG_TV", "site": "@WJHG_TV", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "keywords": "Dolphins Fall In 5A Title Game 3-0 Saturday", "google-site-verification": "orfdzs_E4bRXom1qluA34zerrmjsg4QfrlLSkrR3ZAQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Dolphins Fall In 5A Title"}, "article_summary": "That final game coming Saturday afternoon in the 5A State Championship game against the same Archbishop McCarthy team that beat Mosley in the title game in 2013!\nFort Myers, FL---One way or another, the Mosley baseball team knew Saturday would be its final game.\nI mean that what you expect in a state championship game, or any game.\"\nThe Mosley coach then began vociferously arguing about that.\nAs for that bizarre ejection, coach Harless telling Greg as he approached the umpire, it was the ump who said something out of line."}
