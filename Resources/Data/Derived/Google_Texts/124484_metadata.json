Depending on where they live, they may qualify for Medicaid. Let\u2019s break it down.\n\nPermanent residents and others lawfully here qualify for Obamacare, more properly called the Affordable Care Act. If you cannot afford the insurance premiums, you will qualify for a federal subsidy. If you don\u2019t have health insurance by the end of March, you may face penalties.\n\nPermanent residents qualify for Medicare (a federal health insurance program) if they have worked in the United States for a total of 40 quarters \u2014 10 years. U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents at least age 65, who have been here five years, may buy into Medicare if they don\u2019t have the work history. Individuals who qualify to buy-in to Medicare can choose to participate in Medicare or, buy Obamacare insurance. Individuals who have \u201cpremium free\u201d Medicare or Medicaid are not eligible for Obamacare.\n\nMedicaid is a need-based health insurance program for individuals with little or no income. In some states, including South Carolina, you cannot get full-Medicaid until you have been a permanent resident for five years. You can however, get Medicaid reimbursement for emergency services. In some states, including New York, all permanent residents who meet the income qualifications can get Medicaid. You can get more information about Obamacare and the foreign born at https://www.healthcare.gov/immigration-status-and-the-marketplace/.\n\nThe Statue of Liberty stands tall in New York Bay, a beacon to immigrants worldwide (Bryan Smith for New York Daily News)\n\nQ: I would like to apply for citizenship, but I just realized that my permanent resident card expired. Can I submit my application with the expired card or do I have to renew it then submit my application?\n\nName Withheld, Queens\n\nA: You can naturalize without renewing your card. Though your card is expired, you are still a permanent resident. A permanent resident whose card whose card was stolen, lost or expired can get U.S. citizenship without getting a new card.\n\nSome people are confused about whether a naturalization applicant needs an unexpired card in hand to naturalize. If you ask USCIS officials whether a person with an expired or missing card must replace the card before naturalizing, many will answer \u201cyes.\u201d But that\u2019s only because the law says that a permanent resident must always be in possession of a valid card. However, if you ask USCIS whether you can naturalize without a valid card, the answer is again \u201cyes.\u201d A person with required number of years of permanent residence can naturalize without producing an unexpired plastic card.\n\nAllan Wernick is an attorney and director of the City University of New York\u2019s Citizenship Now! project.
