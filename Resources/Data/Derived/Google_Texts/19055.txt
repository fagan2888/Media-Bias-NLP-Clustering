With your indulgence, I'll reference one more time what I said in the immediate aftermath of this week's Brussels terror attacks:

Key, again, is factual reporting that highlights the various strains of Islam (as we have said a million times, there is "no one Islam") and avoids the simplistic "Islamophobia" propaganda that plagued so much of the coverage last time.

USA Today, whose news coverage is to journalism what McDonald's cheeseburgers are to fine dining, didn't get the memo. But give the national newspaper credit for going all the way with its totally predictable, stereotypical approach. This is the online headline on the story featured in Thursday's print edition:

'Islamophobia': U.S. cities face anti-Muslim backlash

Yawn.

So what's the cure for the tired brand of "reporting" demonstrated by USA Today? Glad you asked.

You heard about Ted Cruz's remarks concerning his desire to see stepped-up patrols of "Muslim neighborhoods," right?
