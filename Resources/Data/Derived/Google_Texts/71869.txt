What is horticultural therapy?

Horticultural Therapy is the process of connecting people and plants through vocational, social, and therapeutic programs under the direction of a horticultural therapist, who is trained and skilled at creating customized activities, and/or garden spaces that accommodate people with a wide range of abilities (with goals, objectives and recorded outcomes). Horticultural therapy designs and programs can offer cognitive, social. physical benefits with year-round application indoors and outdoors in schools, senior and community centers, adult day care, assisted living, nursing homes, rehabilitation facilities, hospitals including veterans, vocational schools, substance abuse rehabilitation, family shelters and resource centers, developmentally disabled day programs and group homes, day and residential housing for adults with autism, community and county parks, gardens and arboreta.

Horticultural therapists are typically part of a treatment team. Treatment teams are very depending on the client and the setting. In clinical setting for example, the team could consist of a clinical or medical director, a counselor, a social worker. In a rehabilitative setting the team might consist of a doctor, orthopedic, a nurse, an occupational or speech therapist, social worker or counselor. In a vocational setting the team could consist of vocational counselor, social worker, teacher and employer.

Individual and group participant activities may take place in a greenhouse, a garden, or in a designated space that is accessible, barrier-free and designed for maximum safety, participation and development of the individual. Activities may include the growing of plants, nature crafts and floral design, garden maintenance from weeding to watering to pruning. Horticultural therapists provide any need support including adaptive devices, tools, or physical assistance. "Horticultural therapy puts into practice what those of us in the green industry already know, plants do improve peoples' lives," said Dominick Mondi, executive director New Jersey Nursery and Landscape Association.

Horticultural therapists are trained to use plants and the cycles of nature to teach life skills. Nature and plant life cycles have built-in and unending benefit to people. In working with clients therapists explain and implement social and psychological concepts. Concepts like nurturing, responsibility, the importance of strong "roots" and the value of rejuvenation.

"Designating a week each year to raise awareness to Horticultural Therapy will hopefully expand opportunities for more people to take advantage of the many benefits it offers," said Senator Bateman (R-Somerset, Hunterdon, Mercer and Middlesex). "Horticultural Therapy is a time proven practice dating back centuries that's helped countless people from children to seniors to veterans to those with special needs," he added.
