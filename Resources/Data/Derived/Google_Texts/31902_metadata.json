An officer from the task force also had confirmed the killing. However, an Oxford University researcher tracking Jericho told the outlet the lion was alive and moving as of 8 p.m. local time Saturday.\n\nAccording to CNN, the GPS device used to track Jericho didn\u2019t suggest anything out of the ordinary.\n\nCecil the lion\u2019s killing sparked an international uproar after the beloved feline was lured out of a national park, killed, skinned and beheaded last week by an American hunter and two local guides. USA Today also reported Jericho recently had been seen protecting Cecil\u2019s orphaned cubs.\n\nThe two Zimbabweans, a professional hunter and a farm owner, have been arrested. Zimbabwe authorities are working with the United States government to extradite Walter Palmer back to the African country to face potential charges for the alleged trophy kill.\n\nFollowing the public outcry, Zimbabwe has suspended the hunting of lions, leopards and elephants in the area where Cecil was killed. Wildlife authorities said it was necessary to tighten hunting regulations following Cecil\u2019s death, and they hope the incident raises awareness to the country\u2019s regulations.\n\n\u201cThe outrage over Cecil could have helped because people are now more aware and ready to come with information,\u201d Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife conservation director Geoffrey Matipano told The Associated Press.\n\nNews\n\nGeneral {{Title}} Remove Change News General Courts Web Only Crime Outdoors Events Center Non-Homepage Boredom Busters Pipeline Positively KELOLAND Technology Hunger Affordable Care Act Shops Flooding Remembering 9/11 Drought JazzFest Spring Storm Honor Flight Spencer Anniversary\n\nDoApp Health News Business News Sports\n\nAgriculture Markets Livestock Crops Politics\n\nHealthBeat Cancer Children's Health Heart Health Wellness & Nutrition General Health Beat Women's Health RX Resources What's Going Around OTC Diabetes Recalls Dental Health Men's Health\n\nPolitics South Dakota Legislature Budget Congress Taxes General Local Campaign President US Senate New Laws US House Iowa Ballot Issues Local Races Minnesota Gubernatorial\n\nEducation Funding College Elementary High School Pre K School Supplies Middle School\n\nSports Professional College High School Sports Zone Headlines Summit League Tournament Olympics\n\nBusiness Industry Your Money Matters Development Gas & Energy Legislation Economy/Stocks Employment General Health Care Technology Education Funding Tourism Banking/Finance Housing Transportation Insurance Meetings & Events Retail & Restaurants All Industries On The Move Shops Agriculture\n\nFeatured Stories Eye on KELOLAND Inside KELOLAND\n\nWeather Snow Forecast Records Rain Flooding Drought WX Corner General\n\nWorld News\n\nInvestigates GEAR UP\n\nSponsored Done\n\n\u00a9 2016 KELOLAND TV.
