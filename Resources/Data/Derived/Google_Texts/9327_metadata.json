That company \u2013 publicly traded since 2007 \u2013 provides products and services for 4,400 hospitals (that is four out of five hospitals in the country) and 122,000 non-acute care health centers across the United States. The company specializes in cost and clinical resource management as well as purchasing and revenue cycle management. MedAssets also provides change management consulting and data-driven analytic software. The company\u2019s goal is to continually improve the operational and financial bottom line. The company is able to provide consulting insights based on data-driven insights. Thus, MedAssets challenges its clients to improve the quality and effectiveness of the health care they provide based on hard numbers and solutions the company can provide. After spending more than 30 years in the health care industry and attaining many senior management positions, Bardis has acquired not only the expertise but the relationships that are key to any business. He has been named by Modern Healthcare as one of the 100 Most Influential Leaders in Healthcare for the last four years (2011, 2012, 2013, 2014). Bardis was the 1995 Inc. Magazine Entrepreneur of the Year and was Ernst & Young\u2019s Entrepreneur of the Southeast in 2012.\n\nJohn Bardis is a maverick in the health care industry. Recently retired as president, chief executive officer and now chairman emeritus of MedAssets (see box), he sounds a loud and clear call for supporting the Affordable Care Act.\n\nA 30-year veteran of managing health care costs, Bardis says it is not only important to the health of everyone, but if we don\u2019t get a grip on the true cause of skyrocketing health care costs, an economic crisis of epic proportions is unavoidable.\n\nSo why is Bardis so sure he is right?\n\n\u201cWell, what is clear and irrefutable is there are 40 million uninsured Americans, many of whom have no chance of ever being able to afford health insurance, and that number is growing for the same reasons,\u201d Bardis said.\n\nThose reasons are founded in how the government originally began paying for health care with Medicare in the 1960s with a cost-plus system of payments, he said.\n\nBut in the mid-80s, there was a cost split. The government capped the rising costs in Medicare of what are called diagnostic related groups (DRGs) and linked any rising costs to a cost-of-living figure. But DRGs in the private sector had no such cap,\n\n\u201cSo private sector costs continued to rise, until companies could no longer absorb those costs and passed them on to employees,\u201d he said. \u201cNow premium costs are so high, individuals have been driven out of the insurance market altogether.\u201d\n\nThe situation has become so bad, those who don\u2019t have insurance cannot afford premiums on their own, and people with pre-existing conditions are in an even worse situation. Not only were their premiums much higher, but often insurance could not be procured at any price.\n\nToday, health costs are growing at a much faster rate than wage growth or even economic growth.\n\n\u201cIt was only a question of time before the affordability of health care versus wage and wealth growth would segment out the poor and the middle class. And that is exactly what has happened to us,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act is an attempt to rectify that, but Bardis says the law is \u201cby no means perfect,\u201d nor was the way the law was legislated.\n\nThe disparity in costs are so great now between what wage earners can pay and what care costs, many of that 40 million uninsured do not seek care until they are at such a point of deterioration that they must walk into an emergency room.\n\n\u201cThere couldn\u2019t be a more expensive place to get your primary care than the ER,\u201d Bardis said.\n\nThe reality is the country needed an answer to the insurance issue. An estimated 15 million people are covered today who were not before the law.\n\nConservatives say the number of newly insured is nowhere near 15 million, but closer to 5 million. Bardis says no matter the number \u2013 and he says it is nearer the upper range \u2013 the next step is clear.\n\n\u201cWe have to manage health, not health care,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re in a much better place if we have an educated consumer in a transparent market.\u201d\n\nIn a market today of high deductibles, the economic forces should reward the person who chooses health care at the most reasonable cost. But Bardis says the consumer is snookered because there is an \u201copaqueness\u201d on the cost side.\n\nCosts can be hidden in so many ways consumers can\u2019t make an informed comparison decision.\n\nMeanwhile, the onset of the presidential campaign has brought more cloudiness to the issue. Conservatives agree health care needs fixing, but say first Obamacare must go.\n\n\u201cThat is unproductive, and there is nobody who believes that is going to happen. But it is a tear-down political strategy \u2013 just tear down the other guy,\u201d Bardis said.\n\nRather, the conversation should be about what adjustments can be made to make the act better. States that rejected the Affordable Care Act have only hurt themselves, Bardis said. Those states have left more uninsured on the outside.\n\n\u201cSo I am waiting for someone to come up with a better idea,\u201d he said.\n\nBardis says he is a fiscal conservative, but 40 million uninsured is a looming social problem that cannot be ignored.\n\nMedAssets manages $400 billion in claims for U.S. hospitals, so this is a problem Bardis has wrestled with for the last 16 years.\n\n\u201cWe have a pretty good bird\u2019s eye view of how payments and costs don\u2019t coordinate with one another,\u201d he said.\n\nMedicaid and Medicare today have 67 million on the rolls. That number will grow to 85 million by the 2020s.\n\nPart of this is the product of the good health care that Americans receive today. Life expectancy has gone up every year for 100 years except 1919 and its worldwide flu epidemic. That is an actuarial nightmare as more people are living longer.\n\nWhen Bardis compares the economic growth of about 1.2 percent to 1.5 percent and health care costs cruising at 5 percent a year, the economic train wreck is only a question of when.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t get a handle on costs. And we can\u2019t survive with wage and earnings growth at under 2 percent and health care growing at 5 percent. That\u2019s nearly a 500 percent disparity,\u201d he said.\n\nThe great challenge is to bring health costs into line with economic growth. America is 4.1 percent of the world population and represents 40 percent of health care dollars.\n\nThe world GDP is $77 trillion, and the United States accounts for $18 trillion of that, or 22 percent. But America spends 40 percent of the health care GDP.\n\n\u201cThat tells you we\u2019re spending more than we should,\u201d Bardis said. \u201cWe have 4 percent of the population consuming 40 percent of the global health care GDP.\u201d\n\nAnother disconnect in the economic balance is the United States has the largest pharmaceutical expenditure in the world, yet Americans also pay the highest price for drugs. In almost any other market, the largest buyer should be getting a discount.\n\n\u201cThese numbers tell me we can do better,\u201d Bardis said. \u201cAnd we have the resources to do it. We have the best medical infrastructure in the world. But by any measure, you have to conclude that America\u2019s costs for health care are too high.\n\n\u201cCosts will be the rule of thumb going forward,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t have health care costs growing at five times that of the economy. That\u2019s why costs have to be addressed.\u201d", "article_metadata": {}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9d08\"", "article_summary": "A 30-year veteran of managing health care costs, Bardis says it is not only important to the health of everyone, but if we don\u2019t get a grip on the true cause of skyrocketing health care costs, an economic crisis of epic proportions is unavoidable.\n\u201cWe have to manage health, not health care,\u201d he said.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t have health care costs growing at five times that of the economy.\nConservatives agree health care needs fixing, but say first Obamacare must go.\nBut by any measure, you have to conclude that America\u2019s costs for health care are too high."}
