Sacco\u2019s bewilderingly ill-advised tweet about AIDS was, in a quintessentially 21st-century way, the big story of the weekend \u2014 no mean feat, considering the last three days have seen the ongoing saga of Vladimir Putin\u2019s compulsory \u201camnesty,\u201d the specter of civil war in South Sudan, an ongoing purge in North Korea, and the arrival of the deadline to sign up for Obamacare. But shit, that stuff is difficult. It\u2019s much easier just to pile on some random on the Internet.\n\nLook, I\u2019m not in any way defending Sacco. Even if I were inclined to do so \u2014 and I\u2019m not \u2014 it\u2019s not for me to do, because I don\u2019t know her any more than you do. As Index on Censorship\u2019s Padraig Reidy points out here, \u201cThe problem Justine Sacco has \u2026 is that you and I really have no idea who she is, apart from the woman who makes bad jokes on Twitter.\u201d You have to be very careful what you say on the Internet, and especially on Twitter, because it\u2019s going to be taken with zero context \u2014 and if you\u2019re in PR and don\u2019t understand that\u2026 well, you\u2019ve got problems. And more to the point, context or not, Sacco\u2019s tweet was indefensible, and it was inevitable that she got the arse from her job, a) for apparently being generally terrible and b) for being hilariously incompetent at PR, which is supposed to be her line of work.\n\nThat said, there was something somewhat unedifying about the spectacle of the entire Internet going after her. I\u2019m not suggesting that the anger her tweet roused wasn\u2019t merited \u2014 if you say dumb shit in a public forum, you have to expect to deal with public opinion. I\u2019m not even referring to the sort of mob mentality that characterized the response to her tweet (which The Wrap\u2019s Sharon Waxman, with nearly Sacco-esque cluelessness, referred to yesterday as a \u201clynch mob\u201d). This being the Internet, some of the responses to Sacco\u2019s joke were way out of line, but generally, if you\u2019re going to make a joke that manages to combine racism, ignorance, and insensitivity in the space of 12 words, well, you have to expect disaster.\n\nStill, some commentators have rushed to Sacco\u2019s defense, or at least questioned the way events panned out, penning thinkpieces calling the whole affair \u201ctrial by social media\u201d and \u201ccyberbullying,\u201d and the occasional writer has even pined for the good old days when you could get away with this shit. Let\u2019s be clear: in the good old days, this stuff was said in private at dinner parties by people who\u2019d deny in public that they could possibly hold any sort of prejudices against the help. If we live in a world where it\u2019s a lot more difficult to get away with being an ignorant fool than it used to be, then good.\n\nNo, the thing that bothers me here is the idea that taking up your virtual pitchfork and calling for Justine Sacco to get dragged into the Internet town square constitutes doing something positive and meaningful. It\u2019s all very well to feel that you\u2019re fighting the good fight against racism and ignorance by marshaling your righteous outrage in 140 characters or less, but really, the end result here is that\u2026 one fundamentally insignificant PR type at a company that owns a bunch of silly Internet brands has lost her job.\n\nIn this respect, Waxman had a point when she observed that \u201cthe mob\u2026 just likes to point and jeer and wallow in the fact that someone else gets to be the object of ridicule.\u201d This is true, because there\u2019s a very strong awareness, I think, that with one ill-advised tweet, it could be you. Sure, you\u2019re probably never going to tweet anything as awful as what Sacco said \u2014 at least, I hope you aren\u2019t \u2014 but who hasn\u2019t said something on Twitter that they\u2019ve looked back on later and thought, \u201cUgh, maybe that wasn\u2019t such a great idea\u201d? And who didn\u2019t breathe at least a little internal sigh of relief that it wasn\u2019t their tweet that Gawker picked up on a slow news day?\n\nIt\u2019s this, perhaps, that lies at least partly behind what South African writer Tauriq Moosa calls the Internet\u2019s \u201cdefault to hate\u201d in an excellent essay about the Sacco incident. People love to elevate themselves by comparison to others \u2014 it\u2019s why the general public laps up gossip about celebrities, why we revel in scandal and sanctimony. It\u2019s why people are generally so judgmental \u2014 and why a lot of the response to the Sacco affair wasn\u2019t: \u201cHey, she\u2019s terrible.\u201d It was \u201cHey, I\u2019m better than her.\u201d\n\nAnd now everyone is about to go on vacation, and in a couple of days the whole thing will be forgotten. AIDS will still be an ongoing disaster in sub-Saharan Africa. Racist, stupid people will still be racist and stupid. What\u2019s changed? What did it all mean? Nothing for anyone except Justine Sacco, really. And even for her, all that\u2019s most likely changed is that a) she\u2019s looking for work and b) she won\u2019t be back on Twitter in a hurry. As Moosa observes, \u201cVery little that\u2019s unique is gained by leaping on the moral bandwagon against her here\u2026 your voice probably won\u2019t be the one that finally \u2018makes\u2019 her change her mind [if] she is a fully-fledged racist.\u201d\n\nWhen I started this piece, I googled \u201cJustine Sacco\u201d and got 230 million results. Two hundred and thirty million. And now that I\u2019m finishing it an hour or so later, I googled her again to quickly check on that figure\u2026 to find that it\u2019s risen to 249 million. Imagine what 249 million people looks like. And then imagine that every one of those people who took the five seconds to tweet something \u201cwitty\u201d about Sacco also took five more seconds to, say, donate $5 to an AIDS charity.
