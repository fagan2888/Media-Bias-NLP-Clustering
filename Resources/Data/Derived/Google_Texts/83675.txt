Senator Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) says that the government shutdown this past fall was all part of the GOP’s war on women.

“Remember last year’s government shutdown that nearly tanked our economy?” she said on the Senate Floor Tuesday. “That fight started with a GOP effort to hold the whole operation of the federal government hostage in order to try to force Democrats and the president to let employers deny workers access to birth control.”

In reality, the government shutdown occurred when Congress failed to agree upon a budget plan for the upcoming fiscal year. House Republicans insisted that the new spending bill defund or at least chip away at Obamacare.

Warren said that she cannot believe lawmakers are still debating whether employers can “deny women access to birth control.” She reminded the Senate that it is 2014, not 1914. “Most Americans thought this was settled long, long ago,” she said, “but for some reason, Republicans keep dragging us back here over and over and over again.”



The Hobby Lobby case, Warren explained, “is just the most recent battle in an all-out Republican assault on women’s access to basic health care.”

When the Blunt Amendment failed to pass in 2012, the GOP “doubled down” by shutting down the government and holding it hostage, according to Warren. “Well, we rejected the hostage taking,” she said, noting that the president, the Democrats, and the American people all “said no to this offensive idea.”

But with Hobby Lobby, instead of listening to the American people, Warren continued, the GOP “turned to their right-wing friends on the Supreme Court.”

Warren’s claim was first spotted by the Washington Examiner.
