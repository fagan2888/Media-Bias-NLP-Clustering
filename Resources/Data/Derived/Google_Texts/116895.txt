A child is credited with saving his pregnant mother and siblings when he called 911 after a crash that killed his father and knocked his mother unconscious, according to a GoFundMe page for the family.

Friends say Tony Schmucker had a medical emergency behind the wheel while rushing his wife, Jill, and children to the hospital on Jan. 13 so she could deliver her third son, the page said.

The Colorado State Patrol could not confirm a medical emergency caused Schmucker to drive off the left side of the road at Lodge Pole Drive in Bellvue, although that is something troopers are investigating.

“We won’t know that until the coroner is done with the report,” said Colorado State Patrol Trooper Alisha Danko.

The car ran down an embankment, struck a large boulder and rolled multiple times, Danko said.

When Jill and Tony Schmucker were unresponsive, family said that the couple’s oldest son was able to call 911 to get help.

Tony was pronounced dead at the hospital, Danko said.

Jill was taken to a hospital where she had an emergency C-section to deliver their son, the GoFundMe page said.

“We have just learned that … Jill is in surgery to repair her broken back that she received in the accident,” the page said. “She is expected to make a full recovery. But with three small children, she is going to need lots of support.”

Community members are encouraged to donate to the fund that will help Jill and her children.

“Please help us raise money for his beautiful wife and children as they learn to live without him,” the page said.

In three days, the fund has raised more than $32,000.
