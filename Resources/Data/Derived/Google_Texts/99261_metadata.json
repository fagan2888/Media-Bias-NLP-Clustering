The Department of Health Services would see the bulk of them.\n\n737 new nurses and support staff would replace part time RN\u2019s hired by the county on a daily basis, said Chief Nursing Officer Vivian Branchick. \u201cWhen you have your own employees, they have more commitment to patients,\u201d she said.\n\nFujioka conceded hiring so many full time county nurses is a significant shift in policy. But he said the move is designed to help LA County compete for newly insured patients under the Affordable Care Act. About 300,000 people currently enrolled in county healthcare programs have the option of selecting a provider other than LA County.\n\n\u201cWe want to keep them,\u201d Fujioka said. The initial net cost of the new nurses would be $17 million, he said. Supervisors, which must approve the budget, did not immediately react to the proposal.\n\nUnder Fujioka\u2019s proposed 2014-15 budget, the total number of budgeted county positions would rise from 103,678 to 105,023 \u2013 a 1.3 percent increase. Highlights:\n\nDepartment of Children and Family Services: 100 new social worker positions and 26 support staff \u201cto reduce caseloads and improve child safety.\u201d The proposal follows the release of a blue ribbon report that found myriad problems at the agency charged with protecting children in foster care and other vulnerable situations.\n\nSheriff\u2019s Department: 189 new positions, mostly to implement the recommendations of the Citizens Commission on Jail Violence, which found \u201ca persistent pattern of unreasonable force\u201d by deputies against inmates. 35 positions will be in the newly created Inspector General\u2019s office.\n\nMental Health Department: 47 positions. \u201cThis includes additional social workers\u201d to help with the \u201cgrowing demand for mental health services.\u201d\n\n(Here's a video on how LA County creates a budget for an often byzantine organization that provides an array services across more than 4,000 square miles).\n\nThe budget projects sales and property tax revenues will rise about four percent in the coming year. \u201cThat\u2019s overly conservative,\u201d said Chris Thornberg of Beacon Economics.\n\nThornberg, whose firm does consulting work for the county, said newly assessed property values would likely bring in more tax revenue to the county than has been projected. Fujioka acknowledged the county must reassess the value of 345,000 homes that likely lost value during the recession.\n\n\u201cStating how many will have an increase in value and how much that increase will be is a very difficult prediction,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would be unwise to guess at this point.\u201d\n\nOther budget highlights:\n\nAll county employees will see a 2% cost of living increase October 1, and a second 2% cost of living increase April 1, under labor contracts.\n\nPublic library hours restored. The budget restores $3.6 million in funding to the library budget.\n\nThe county faces continuing challenges, Fujioka said. Prison realignment has dumped thousands of prisoners on the county, pension funds have unfunded liabilities and \u201clots of old county buildings\u201d need to be fixed.\n\nBut LA County, like most local governments, is in much better shape than it was just a few years ago. In 2010, the county faced a $492 million dollar deficit. This budget is balanced.\n\nFujioka still closely watches the economy.\n\n\u201cMy biggest concern is whether the economy is truly growing,\u201d he said. \u201cHave we hit the point of stabilization?\u201d", "article_metadata": {"author": "Southern California Public Radio", "og": {"site_name": "Southern California Public Radio", "description": "\"The county continues to emerge from an extremely difficult economic period,\" said LA County CEO Bill Fujioka.
