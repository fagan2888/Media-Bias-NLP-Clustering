The lien protects the government\u2019s interest in all property, including real estate, personal property and financial assets.\n\n\u201cWe are giving notice that taxes including interest and penalties have been assessed against the named taxpayer,\u201d the IRS said in the notice. \u201cWe have made a demand for payment of this liability, but it remains unpaid therefore there is a lien on all property and rights to property belonging to this taxpayer for the amount of these taxes.\u201d\n\nMayor Block on Monday said that he had originally planned to \u201ctake care\u201d of the unpaid tax bill at the end of 2015, but was unable to because he had to deal with a personal medical issue.\n\n\u201cBeing out of the office for several months due to an unforeseen family medical setback has been very challenging financially,\u201d Block said in a statement. \u201cHowever, with the problem behind my family now and my office reopening next week, I fully expect to take care of all my financial obligations in the coming months.\u201d\n\nBlock first announced the \u201cmedical issue\u201d on Dec. 21 when he said he would have to postpone the oath of office planned for the next day. The Laurinburg cardiologist was sworn in five weeks later.\n\nWhen reached by telephone, Block declined to say what the medical issue was or why he was not able to pay the taxes when they were first assessed on Nov. 17, 2014 or on Nov. 23, 2015.\n\nAnd when asked how he was able to spend nearly five times as much as his opponent in the 2015 race for mayor, but not pay his taxes, Block said he thought he could to do both at that time.\n\nBlock\u2019s campaign, which according to reports was funded entirely by personal contributions from Block himself, spent a total of $60,075 to unseat incumbent Mayor Tommy Parker. Beginning Aug. 4, Block contributed $11,656 in five installments by the end of the reporting period ending Sept. 22. Between Sept. 25 and Nov. 6 came 14 installments totaling $49,495, according Block\u2019s campaign finance report.\n\n\u201cThat was a decision I made,\u201d he said. \u201cI felt I would be able to pay my taxes until this issue arose.\u201d\n\nBlock, who had served as Laurinburg\u2019s mayor for four years before losing the race to Parker in 2011, reclaimed the seat with 60 percent of the vote in 2015.\n\nBlock added that he does not see his tax problem affecting how he does his job as mayor.\n\n\u201cThe citizens will have to decide for themselves whether they think it is an issue,\u201d Block said. \u201cI plan to pay my taxes with late fees. My city, county and state taxes are paid and I have every intention of paying the federal taxes.\n\n\u201cIt is not acceptable for people not to pay their taxes, but sometimes circumstances arise and you have to do the best you can do.\u201d\n\nBlock said he plans to reopen his medical practice \u2014 Scotland Cardiology \u2014 on April 6.\n\nMatthew Block http://laurinburgexchange.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/web1_block_1mayor-7-IMG_9968_cmyk-2.jpg Matthew Block\n\nMayor says \u2018medical setback\u2019 delayed payment\n\nBy Scott Witten [email protected]\n\nReach editor Scott Witten at 910-506-3023\n\nReach editor Scott Witten at 910-506-3023\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.\n\nDisqus", "article_metadata": {"geo.region": "US-NC", "DC.format": "text/html", "geo.placename": "Laurinburg", "og": {"site_name": "Laurinburg Exchange", "description": "LAURINBURG \u2014 The federal Internal Revenue Service has filed a tax lien against Laurinburg Mayor Matthew Block, according to public records.The lien \u2014 filed by the IRS at the Scotland County Courthouse on Feb. 22 \u2014 says Block owes the federal government a total of $101,358.68.The notice said the lien is for 1040 taxes for [...]", "title": "Laurinburg mayor owes IRS $101,000", "url": "http://laurinburgexchange.com/news/local-news-1/4507/laurinburg-mayor-owes-irs-101000", "image": "http://laurinburgexchange.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/web1_block_1mayor-7-IMG_9968_cmyk-2-188x300.jpg", "locality": "Laurinburg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "region": "US-NC"}, "DC.contributor": "Laurinburg Exchange", "twitter": {"image": "http://laurinburgexchange.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/web1_block_1mayor-7-IMG_9968_cmyk-2.jpg", "site": "@LbgExchange", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "- Laurinburg Exchange - laurinburgexchange.com"}, "DC.rights": "Civitas Media", "DC.type": "Text", "DC.publisher": "Laurinburg Exchange", "DC.identifier": "http://laurinburgexchange.com", "DC.relation": "http://dublincore.org/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "article": {"section": "Local News 1", "published_time": "2016-03-28T17:50:11+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-28T17:50:11+00:00", "author": "http://laurinburgexchange.com/author/englewoodindependent-2"}, "DC.language": "en_US", "DC.title": "Laurinburg Exchange, Laurinburg NC - www.laurinburgexchange.com"}, "article_summary": "LAURINBURG \u2014 The federal Internal Revenue Service has filed a tax lien against Laurinburg Mayor Matthew Block, according to public records.\nMy city, county and state taxes are paid and I have every intention of paying the federal taxes.\nA federal tax lien is the government\u2019s legal claim against a property when someone neglects or fails to pay a tax debt.\n\u201cThe citizens will have to decide for themselves whether they think it is an issue,\u201d Block said.\nThe lien \u2014 filed by the IRS at the Scotland County Courthouse on Feb. 22 \u2014 says Block owes the federal government a total of $101,358.68."}
