(The only remaining coal-fired plant in Thunder Bay will be converted to biomass by the end of next year.)\n\nWhile millions across the province worked tirelessly at the grassroots level to achieve this victory, a special debt is owed to Jack Gibbons of the Ontario Clean Air Alliance.\n\nI remember Gibbons guest lecturing in our class a dozen years ago, noting how, in 1997, the majority of Ontarians didn\u2019t even know about the five coal-fired plants in Ontario, the \u201cdirty-smog-secret\u201d of the province. In a recent conversation he recounted that \u201cwe knew we could get a dramatic reduction\u201d not only in smog, but also in acid rain, mercury omissions, and a whole host of other pernicious pollutants if coal-fired plants went extinct.\n\nSlowly but assiduously, by networking with key politicians, such as Mississauga Mayor Hazel McCallion, and critical expert groups, such as the Ontario Medical Association, the Clean Air Alliance was able to build a broad-based coalition that convinced the province of the need to take action.\n\nAs Al Gore, flanked by premier Wynne, rousingly proclaimed, \u201cOntario has become the first regional jurisdiction in all of North America to take these steps on the burning of coal. Congratulations, Ontario!\u201d\n\nThe elimination of coal-fired plants in Ontario is a deeply hopeful story. It shows that progress can be made in combating pollution and addressing climate change. It underscores that grassroots organizing can lead to structural, political changes that directly improve our environment and quality of life.\n\nIt also demonstrates that those who struggle for a cleaner environment are ultimately struggling for healthier human communities.\n\nThanks to all those who are part of this story, we will all breathe a little easier tonight, and for many nights to come.\n\nStephen Bede Scharper is associate professor of environment at the University of Toronto.
