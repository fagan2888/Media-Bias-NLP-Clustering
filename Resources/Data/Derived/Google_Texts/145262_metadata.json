Rapid DNA is a portable genetic testing program which will be plugged \u201cinto the FBI's Combined DNA Index (CODIS) and Next Generation Identification (NGI) systems from the booking environment.\u201d\n\nUsing Rapid DNA, law enforcement agents will be able to match genetic material collected with other identifying information from central databases, to quickly identify individuals encountered by law enforcement.\n\nThe press release stated Rap Black is intended to allow police to run background and criminal history checks on individuals holding positions of trust, such as public school teachers. IPS is a facial-recognition software tool able to categorize and search through photographs of potential criminal suspects.\n\nWhat may sound like exciting advances in technology, however, may actually be new ways to violate citizens\u2019 privacy. The volume of \u201cbiometric information\u201d\u2014quantified identification markers such as genetic signatures, fingerprints, eye retina and iris patterns, vocal patterns, or hand measurements\u2014collected by law enforcement agents is immense.\n\nBig Brother Shares, Cares\n\n\u201cInteragency information-sharing can be helpful for crime-solving. However, there are many questions about such data sharing which should be answered, so the public can be sure the data sharing is legal and useful,\u201d Melissa Ngo, a nationally recognized privacy and information-policy consultant said.\n\nBefore working as a consultant, Ngo served as senior counsel and director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center\u2019s (EPIC) Identification and Surveillance Project. As Senior Counsel, she frequently advised state legislators on issues involving government surveillance and privacy rights.\n\n\u201cWhere does the data come from\u2014was it gathered legally for this purpose? How is it proved to be accurate and complete, so there won't be problems with misidentification where an innocent individual is arrested or harassed,\u201d she added. \u201cSuch deeply personal information as iris scans or other biometric data should only be legally gathered, used and shared with stringent protections in place to ensure the privacy and civil liberties of individuals are protected,\u201d\n\nAnother concern raised by Ngo was the threat of law enforcement agencies sharing their collected data with civilian agencies within the government.\n\n\u201cWhat will it [the data] be used for\u2014only specific crimes or will there be mission creep, allowing the use be broadened to civil matters,\u201d she asked.\n\nFacebooked\n\nAdditionally, government agents are using individuals\u2019 Facebook account to compile private data about those people and their friends, in order to be able facilitate identification, should they commit a crime in the future.\n\nWith facial recognition technology built into Facebook\u2019s \u201ctagging friends\u201d feature, and other information stored on an individual\u2019s personal account, such data collected may be shared with third parties such as the national government.\n\nAdvocates of the new technologies argue there will be no infringement upon citizens\u2019 privacy because Rapid DNA and biometric systems will help law enforcement quickly categorize the lawfully obtained DNA samples for the state and federal databases.\n\nHowever, testifying before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Privacy, Technology, and the Law in 2012, Jennifer Lynch, a senior staff attorney for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, warned NGI would help facilitate situations in which \u201canyone could end up in the database \u2014 even if they\u2019re not involved in a crime\u2014by just happening to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, by fitting a stereotype that some in society have decided is a threat, or by, for example, engaging in suspect activities such as political protest.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Daily Mail, the FBI\u2019s new tracking systems were installed in 18,000 local and state law enforcement agencies in September . The FBI, however, plans to continue to expand the NGI\u2019s functionality in the future, ultimately compiling and storing biometric data on at least 52 million unique individuals.\n\nHannah Yang (yangminhee0116@gmail.com) writes from Athens, Ohio.", "article_metadata": {}, "article_summary": "A third new service, called Rapid DNA, is also planned to be integrated into NGIS in the future.\nThe FBI, however, plans to continue to expand the NGI\u2019s functionality in the future, ultimately compiling and storing biometric data on at least 52 million unique individuals.\nBefore working as a consultant, Ngo served as senior counsel and director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center\u2019s (EPIC) Identification and Surveillance Project.\nAdvocates of the new technologies argue there will be no infringement upon citizens\u2019 privacy because Rapid DNA and biometric systems will help law enforcement quickly categorize the lawfully obtained DNA samples for the state and federal databases.\nThe volume of \u201cbiometric information\u201d\u2014quantified identification markers such as genetic signatures, fingerprints, eye retina and iris patterns, vocal patterns, or hand measurements\u2014collected by law enforcement agents is immense."}
