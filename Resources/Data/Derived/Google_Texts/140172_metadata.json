So let\u2019s stop short of categorizing Lin Enger\u2019s latest novel, \u201cThe High Divide,\u201d a Western. Let\u2019s remove those shackles because this captivating story is more nuanced than that.\n\nYes, it\u2019s set in the mythic, post-Civil War West (specifically, that stretch of windswept high plain from western Minnesota, through the Dakotas to eastern Montana), and many of the familiar tropes are evident: hardscrabble towns, long landscapes, bison herds and dusty chaps. But what matters here isn\u2019t cowboy swagger or pistol spinning \u2014 it\u2019s the resonant inner lives of the compelling characters.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t take long for a reader to recognize that Enger\u2019s inspiration for this wanderer\u2019s story is Homer\u2019s \u201cThe Odyssey\u201d \u2014 the wanderer in Enger\u2019s book is called Ulysses, after all. He\u2019s disappeared from his family in tiny Sloan\u2019s Crossing, Minn. (not far from the border with Fargo, the gateway city to the Dakota Territory), leaving behind his family: Gretta, his Danish-born wife, who is in debt to the town cad; Eli, the restless teen son; and young Danny, prone to debilitating headaches \u2014 and prophetic visions.\n\nEli uncovers a clue: A note to his father from a woman in Bismarck, deeper in the Dakota territory, suggesting a relationship of sorts with Ulysses. Eli (much like Telemachus in \u201cThe Odyssey\u201d) is determined to rebuild the family and sets out secretly one night on a self-determined mission to find Ulysses. He doesn\u2019t count on young Danny tagging along, but naturally Danny does.\n\nAnd we\u2019re off, to Bismark and well beyond, deep into Montana. The adventure unfolds in prose at turns rollicking and sanguine; Enger is a master of pacing, and once you start turning the pages, there\u2019s no setting the book down. Eli emerges as the most compelling character. His alternating anger at, and desperation for, his father drives him ever forward, caring little for comfort or coherence. But Dad remains always a day, or a step, ahead of them, journeying in the creeks and scrubland of that swath of the Great Plains that\u2019s so often overlooked in contemporary fiction.\n\nAn example:\n\n\u201cThey rode out that day at sun-up with a breeze behind them, the sky cloudless and light blue. Before crossing at the shallow ford north of town, they stopped to survey the country beyond the Yellowstone, rolling and dusty brown, buffalo grass as far as you could see, not a tree or a bush in sight except for what grew along the riverbank and bluffs. No shade and nowhere to hide.\u201d\n\nEnger exercises an exacting adroitness when painting the Wild West \u2014 saloons, shopkeepers, muddy streets, Indians on the horizon \u2014 all should be clich\u00e9, and would be in another writer\u2019s hands, but Enger gives them freshness and clarity.\n\nThere are conveniences, of course. This is fiction, after all, so when a campfire in the distance belongs to a long-sought character from another part of the country we are willing to accept it, but readers will embrace this compelling story, even those who aren\u2019t predisposed to Westerns.\n\nFICTION: WESTERN\n\nWESTERN\n\nThe High Divide\n\nby Lin Enger (Algonquin)", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "A Wild West take on Homer", "title": "A Wild West take on Homer", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/09/25/a-wild-west-take-on-homer/", "image": {"width": 260, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140925__20140928_E6_BK28REVIEWHIGHDIVIDEp1.jpg", "height": 402}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140925__20140928_E6_BK28REVIEWHIGHDIVIDEp1.jpg?w=240", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-25T17:08:22+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T12:40:03+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "He doesn\u2019t count on young Danny tagging along, but naturally Danny does.\nTo brand a novel a \u201cWestern\u201d is to load it with baggage: purple sage, thundering hooves, quick-draw horsemen, gratuitous lawlessness.\nSo let\u2019s stop short of categorizing Lin Enger\u2019s latest novel, \u201cThe High Divide,\u201d a Western.\nBut what matters here isn\u2019t cowboy swagger or pistol spinning \u2014 it\u2019s the resonant inner lives of the compelling characters.\nHis alternating anger at, and desperation for, his father drives him ever forward, caring little for comfort or coherence."}
