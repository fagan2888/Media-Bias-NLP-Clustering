Mark Pryor and Republican challenger Rep. Tom Cotton will feature many contrasts between the candidates.\n\nMost notably, the Cotton campaign will continue to highlight Pryor\u2019s vote for ObamaCare and his mostly reliable votes for President Obama\u2019s policies in the Senate. Meanwhile, Pryor\u2019s campaign will focus on Cotton\u2019s ties to the Tea Party and conservative groups who try to paint him as too far to the right for Arkansas.\n\nBut there are others issues where voters can find contrasts, as we saw this past week on the issue of abortion.\n\nEvery January, pro-lifers mark the anniversary of Roe v. Wade \u2014 the Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion in all 50 states \u2014 with marches and rallies opposing legalized abortion. Making it clear where he stands, Cotton spoke at the Arkansas March for Life in Little Rock where he promised to continue to promote a culture of life.\n\n\u201cLike all people, unborn children are entitled to the God-given right to life and liberty enshrined in the Declaration of Independence and guaranteed in our Constitution,\u201d said Cotton. \u201cAnd I\u2019m working in Congress to defend the sanctity of human life and to preserve and protect the rights of all children, born and unborn. I\u2019ve sponsored legislation that would stop taxpayer dollars from going to organizations that perform abortions. I\u2019ve also supported a bill that would declare that life begins at conception and, as we continue in our efforts to protect the unborn, a bill that stops abortions after the fetus is capable of feeling pain. And I continue to oppose Obamacare and its regulations, with its unconstitutional mandates that private organizations, including churches, pay for abortion.\u201d\n\nCotton\u2019s voting record backs his words, scoring 100 percent on votes tracked by the National Right to Life. Pryor scores a 35 percent on his votes tracked by the same group in his 12 years in the Senate.\n\nThe voting record goes along with a position by Pryor which has been all over the map during his career. Asked about his position on abortion in 1998 while running for attorney general, Pryor simply said, \u201cI am pro-choice.\u201d\n\nBut by 2013, his position seems to have evolved from clearly pro-choice to basically somewhere in the middle\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always leaned toward the pro-life side of that, but I don\u2019t fit neatly into any of the categories,\u201d Pryor told a Northwest Arkansas television station when asked about his view on abortion last April. \u201cI certainly respect that there are circumstances where the woman should be able to make that decision. Of course, I want that to be as infrequent as possible. But I do think that there are times when a woman should make that decision.\u201d\n\nThis past week, Pryor has ducked reporters\u2019 questions about his upcoming vote on a Senate bill that would ban abortion after the point at which unborn babies can experience pain. This is a federal bill similar to a 20-week ban passed by the Arkansas General Assembly last year.\n\nRegardless of a voter\u2019s views on the issue of abortion, they ought to be able to get a clear answer on where the candidates stand. With Cotton, it is clear he favors laws that will limit abortion and protect life. With Pryor, it seems to depend on the year.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nJason Tolbert is an accountant and conservative political blogger.
