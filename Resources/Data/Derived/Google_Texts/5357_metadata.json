He calls for an updated tax code in a detailed plan on his website.\n\nEducation: The junior senator says much of our current education system is outdated. He opposes Common Core and supports more parental involvement. \u201cOur higher education system is antiquated and broken in multiple ways. It is too expensive, too time consuming, and too inflexible for busy single parents and working adults,\u201d Rubio says.\n\nEnvironment: Like many other Republican presidential candidates, Rubio supports the Keystone XL pipeline. He\u2019s been outspoken in his opposition to regulation that prevent growth in the energy industry.\n\nGun control/rights: Rubio says he believes in the right to bear arms. He also thinks that we need to examine why people become violent and address mental health.\n\nHealth care: He opposes Obamacare in favor for a reform that would reduce health care costs and expand access to affordable care. He is against abortions.\n\nImmigration: He supports a merit-based immigration system. According to his website, it would help immigrants assimilate, encourage foreign college students to stay in our country and make the U.S. more competitive.\n\nNational security: Rubio wants to grow the size of the Navy, invest in Air Force intelligence and expand missile defense. To defeat ISIS, he would build a multinational coalition of countries, increase airstrikes of Syria and Iraq, and provide arms to Sunni and Kurdish forces. Rubio says he will re-impose sanctions on Iran on his first day in the White House.\n\nSocial issues: He believes that marriage is between a man and a woman, but also says we should honor the Supreme Court ruling. He says he believes some businesses should be able to refuse service to gay customers.\n\nSocial:\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/MarcoRubio\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/marcorubiofla\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/marcorubio\n\nWebsite: https://marcorubio.com/", "article_metadata": {"description": "Campaign ended: March 15, 2016 Current position: U.S. Senator from Florida Career: U.S. Senate 2011 to present, Florida House of Representatives 2000 to 2008 Hometown: Miami, Florida Family: Married to Jeanette Dousedebes with four children Religion: Roman Catholic On the issues: ...", "generator": "WordPress.com", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=324686068", "og": {"site_name": "fox8.com", "description": "Campaign ended: March 15, 2016 Current position: U.S. Senator from Florida Career: U.S. Senate 2011 to present, Florida House of Representatives 2000 to 2008 Hometown: Miami, Florida Family: Marrie\u2026", "title": "Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio: You Decide 2016", "url": "http://fox8.com/2016/01/22/republican-presidential-candidate-marco-rubio-you-decide-2016/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "https://localtvwjw.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/marco-rubio.jpeg?w=1200", "height": 675}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://localtvwjw.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/marco-rubio.jpeg?w=640"}, "site": "@fox8news", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@fox8news"}, "keywords": "2016 presidential candidate bios, marco rubio, you decide 2016", "p": {"domain_verify": "ab9b95eb1a995697f3c88253f276fa87"}, "fb": {"pages": 74758790293}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "application-name": "fox8.com", "google-site-verification": "RrRVvAvDXFfRHU6-TtZJh28fqDSaZbTLz1xSvv0udQ8", "msvalidate.01": "9CC50DB4C5614EA88B5CFA75E33AAB02", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Fox8NewsCleveland", "published_time": "2016-01-22T17:22:15+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-16T18:19:56+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/Fox8NewsCleveland"}, "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://fox8.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/ea8bceb705ffdd1b50e02de092ee74b4?s=16", "news_keywords": "Marco Rubio, Rubio, Florida, GOP, candidate, president, republican,"}, "article_summary": "\u00d7 Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio: You Decide 2016Campaign ended: March 15, 2016Current position: U.S.\nEnvironment: Like many other Republican presidential candidates, Rubio supports the Keystone XL pipeline.\nHealth care: He opposes Obamacare in favor for a reform that would reduce health care costs and expand access to affordable care.\nNational security: Rubio wants to grow the size of the Navy, invest in Air Force intelligence and expand missile defense.\nIt is too expensive, too time consuming, and too inflexible for busy single parents and working adults,\u201d Rubio says."}
