Parking lots were full Saturday at malls and shops across Green Country. Retailers expect it to be the biggest shopping day of the year, due to last minute Christmas shoppers. Some retailers are staying open around the clock to accommodate the shoppers.

The JCPenney in Owasso is open until midnight, so are Macy's and Target stores. Toys “R” Us will be open until 2:00 a.m.

Andrea Schwartz of Macy's said "Whether it's door buster in the morning until one in the afternoon or the extra 40 percent offs and 20 percent offs, this is really a good time to get your shopping done."
