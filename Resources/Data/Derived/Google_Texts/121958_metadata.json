Eighty-four percent of whistleblowers who reported a compliance problem outside their company first reported the concern to the organization, but moved outside when the employer failed to address the issue, according to research.\n\nHospitals and healthcare organizations must implement protocols to investigate claims of fraud thoroughly and impartially, H&HN reported, which ultimately encourages employees to keep concerns within the organization. Hospital leaders should also arrange training in procedural fairness when dealing with employee reports.\n\nTo successfully hear and address employees' concerns organizations must provide a procedurally fair process, according to research from Tom R. Tyler, professor of law and psychology at Yale Law School. Companies can do that by giving employees:\n\nVoice . Allow employees the opportunity to tell their side of the story in their own words.\n\nNeutrality . Decision-makers should eliminate personal opinions from the equation, and base decisions solely on facts and rules. Employees want to see rules and guidelines applied consistently.\n\nRespect . Treat employees accordingly when they raise concerns, and make them feel they're being taken seriously.\n\nTrust. Create an atmosphere that allows the employee to feel that decision-makers are listening and considering their view point, and that decisions are what will be right for everyone.\n\nThe issue is more relevant than ever, as the Department of Veterans Affairs deals with at least 67 claims from whistleblowers who claim leadership retaliated against them when they brought forward quality and fraud issues, FierceHealthcare previously reported.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- here's the article\n\n- check out the Center's research (.pdf)\n\n- read Tyler's research\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nGovernment investigates 67 claims of VA whistleblower abuse\n\nShould organizations self-report potential fraud?\n\nWhistleblowers help fight healthcare fraud\n\nHMA ex-employee alleges fraud, sues for wrongful termination", "article_metadata": {"description": "As the government makes it easier for hospital employees to report fraud and quality issues, and as\u00a0social media\u00a0gives disgruntled employees an outlet to air dirty laundry, hospitals must work employees to make them feel comfortable addressing concerns internally,\u00a0Hospitals & Health Networks\u00a0reported.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "As the government makes it easier for hospital employees to report fraud and quality issues, and as\u00a0social media\u00a0gives disgruntled employees an outlet to air dirty laundry, hospitals must work employees to make them feel comfortable addressing concerns internally,\u00a0Hospitals & Health Networks\u00a0reported.", "title": "Hospitals must address employee fraud reports with procedural fairness", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/hospitals-must-address-employee-fraud-reports-procedural-fairness/2014-07-25", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Healthcare fraud,HR & Workforce Management,Legal / Regulatory / Risk Management,Operations & Business Management,procedural fairness,social media,Whistleblowers", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "HR & Workforce Management,Legal / Regulatory / Risk Management,Operations & Business Management"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe26a5\"", "article_summary": "In fact, employees still usually go to employers first with concerns, according to research from the Ethics Resource Center.\nHospital leaders should also arrange training in procedural fairness when dealing with employee reports.\nHospitals and healthcare organizations must implement protocols to investigate claims of fraud thoroughly and impartially, H&HN reported, which ultimately encourages employees to keep concerns within the organization.\nTo successfully hear and address employees' concerns organizations must provide a procedurally fair process, according to research from Tom R.
