She first was diagnosed with cancer in 2000, and continued smoking throughout many of her health struggles. But in 2012, Hall began participating in the \u201cTips from Former Smokers\u201d ads by the CDC \u2014 a program funded largley by Obamacare.\n\nThe CDC\u2019s videos of her captured Hall telling her own story about being a smoker. In one video, she advised smokers, \u201cmake a video of yourself before all this happens. Read your children a storybook, or sing a lullaby. I wish I had.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe was a public health hero,\u201d Tom Frieden, director of the CDC, told the AP. \u201cShe may well have saved more lives than most doctors do.\u201d\n\nThe CDC\u2019s ads were the first-ever national cessation push. Fifty-four million dollars were dedicated to funding it, and it\u2019s estimated to have reached 40 million smokers. A survey found that 79 percent of smokers and 74 percent of nonsmokers saw the ads.\n\nAnd that, according to researchers at the CDC, translated into results. They estimate that the commercials of Hall and other smokers inspired 1.6 million people to try to quit, and that 100,000 likely will.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "A woman who starred in the highly-effective anti-smoking ads put out by the Centers for Disease Control died of cancer on Tuesday at 53-years-old.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "A woman who starred in the highly effective anti-smoking ads put out by the Centers for Disease Control died of cancer on Tuesday at 53 years old.", "title": "Woman From CDC\u2019s Anti-Smoking Ads Dies: \u2018She May Well Have Saved More Lives Than Most Doctors Do\u2019", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2013/09/17/2633871/woman-anti-smoking-ads-dies/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/terrie.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A woman who starred in the highly effective anti-smoking ads put out by the Centers for Disease Control died of cancer on Tuesday at 53 years old.", "creator": "@ARStrasser", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/terrie-321x214.jpg", "title": "Woman From CDC\u2019s Anti-Smoking Ads Dies: \u2018She May Well Have Saved More Lives Than Most Doctors Do\u2019", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/terrie.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/terrie.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2013-09-17T11:17:23+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd176e\"", "article_summary": "\u201cShe may well have saved more lives than most doctors do.\u201dThe CDC\u2019s ads were the first-ever national cessation push.\nHealth Woman From CDC\u2019s Anti-Smoking Ads Dies: \u2018She May Well Have Saved More Lives Than Most Doctors Do\u2019 CREDIT:A woman who starred in the highly-effective anti-smoking ads put out by the Centers for Disease Control died of cancer on Tuesday at 53 years old.\nFifty-four million dollars were dedicated to funding it, and it\u2019s estimated to have reached 40 million smokers.\nBut in 2012, Hall began participating in the \u201cTips from Former Smokers\u201d ads by the CDC \u2014 a program funded largley by Obamacare.\nThey estimate that the commercials of Hall and other smokers inspired 1.6 million people to try to quit, and that 100,000 likely will."}
