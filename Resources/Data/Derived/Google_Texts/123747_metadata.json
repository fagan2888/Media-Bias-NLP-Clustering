Detailed analysis of the impact of fees, considered by some an essential component for transparency, were largely curtailed in favor of \u201cstreamlined\u201d disclosures of potential conflicts. Details will be available if the client requests them.\n\nTo continue working with retirement investors, advisors still need to make decisions in a client\u2019s best interest, fees can\u2019t be egregious and conflicts must be disclosed, but in the final rule an advisor is free to engage in any compensation structure to sell virtually any investment product available. That includes products with reputations for being very much not aligned with a retirement saver\u2019s best interests, like variable annuities, non-traded REITs and listed options.\n\nBut some industry observers think the DOL took the adjustments too far.\n\n\u201cWall Street Dodges a Bullet,\u201d wrote Joshua Brown, CEO of Ritholtz Wealth Management in New York, on Fortune.com, noting that virtually all the products brokers sell will still be allowed as long as additional disclosures of conflicted business arrangements are made. \u201cThis will be no trouble at all: Just picture the speed with which you click \u201cAgree\u201d every time iTunes does a software update.\u201d\n\nThomas Perez, secretary of the Dept. of Labor, said \u201cextensive feedback\u201d from industry stakeholders led to the changes, including from the brokerage firms that will be most impacted.\n\nThat impact was most immediately felt in the stock market. Prices for brokerage firms like Primerica and Ameriprise jumped immediately after the rule was published. LPL, the largest independent broker/dealer in the country, was at one point up 7 percent. According to a Morgan Stanley analyst, the Department of Labor \u201cmeaningfully softened\u201d the rule, and \u201cthat\u2019s good news for those companies.\"\n\nKnut Rostad, head of the Institute for the Fiduciary Standard, said \u201cfrom Wall Street reactions, it appears we are aligned agreeing the final rule has been significantly softened. The difference is Wall Street likes it and I don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nAndrew Stoltmann, a Chicago securities attorney, says that on the whole, the rule is a positive one for investors, but \u201cit\u2019s a watered-down version of what many of us thought would be a stringent fiduciary duty. There are carve-outs and holes in this rule that you could drive a pretty big Mack truck through.\u201d\n\n\u201cAny fiduciary duty that can be discharged by disclosure is problematic,\u201d he said. \u201cThey go in the trash just like the prospectus does. As a fiduciary, I can\u2019t rely on disclosure.\u201d\n\nThe best-interest contract exemptions that allow for the sale of investments like variable annuities, non-traded REITs and listed options, as long as the conflicts are disclosed and fees are not unreasonable, requires advisors to still commit to putting their clients interests first by mitigating the harm of those conflicts.\n\n\u201cTo argue in, any instance, that a variable annuity in an IRA is the best option for any investor just doesn\u2019t pass the red-face test,\u201d Stoltmann said.\n\nBut some commentators suggested the DOL is taking a longer-term view by giving opponents a handful of concessions, while keeping intact what Perez repeatedly called the \u201cNorth Star\u201d of the rule, that advisors, regardless of context and regardless of investment product, put client interests ahead of their own.\n\nIn other words, though it is theoretically permissible under the contract exemptions, it is unlikely advisors will have any client for whom there is no better option for their retirement savings than a non-traded REIT or complex annuity.\n\n\u201cIf we are setting ourselves up to lead with the exemptions, then we are going to fail,\u201d said John Anderson, head of practice management for SEI Advisor Network. \u201cWe are starting from a position for the client that is a no-win.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe perceived conflict is still there. You are still going to have to explain your conflict. You are going to have to explain what your fees are,\u201d he said. \u201cI think they are trying to sell this first to the manufacturers. But this is the first shoe to drop. This is a first step and they\u2019re taking it a little softer than they were originally proposing. Five years from now, it will be dramatically different than it is today.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no question they have scaled back disclosure requirements,\u201d says Barbara Roper, the director of investor protection at the Consumer Federation of America. Still, she praised the rule for \u201cclosing the loopholes\u201d so advisors \u201ccan no longer evade their obligation to serve their customers\u2019 best interest.\u201d\n\nThe rule demands firms with advisors working under the best-interest exemption \u201cmust have policies and procedures designed to mitigate harmful impacts of conflicts of interest,\u201d according to the DOL. Mitigation should eliminate many of the \u201ctoxic conflicts that pervade the brokerage and insurance model,\u201d Roper said.\n\nBy mitigating the harm of conflicts, firms will find they can no longer justify them, Roper said. Advisors could still be paid in commissions or other sales-based compensation structures, but firms won\u2019t be allowed to incentivize one product over another. \u201cPaying an advisor more to sell one fund over another? That won\u2019t be allowed. Setting sales quotas won\u2019t be allowed. A ratcheted payout grid? That should be gone,\u201d under the terms of the DOL rule, Roper says.\n\n\u201cHopefully this will put pressure on product sponsors to create products that can compete,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is no reason that variable annuities have to be so costly. If you want to stay competitive with this market, revise the product so it can be sold in a best-interest standard.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Critics contend the Dept. of Labor capitulated to industry interests; others see a giant first step in a long march toward reform.", "title": "Did the DOL Gut the Fiduciary Rule, or Save It?", "og": {"url": "http://wealthmanagement.com/regulation-compliance/did-dol-gut-fiduciary-rule-or-save-it", "image": "http://wealthmanagement.com/site-files/wealthmanagement.com/files/uploads/2016/04/tom-perez-dol-rule.png", "type": "website", "description": "Critics contend the Department of Labor capitulated to industry interests; others see a giant first step in a long march toward reform.", "title": "Did the DOL Gut the Fiduciary Rule, or Save It?"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "revisit-after": "1 day", "keywords": "fiduciary rule, DOL, Industry, NAPA 401k Summit, Regulation & Compliance, Retirement Planning"}, "article_summary": "That should be gone,\u201d under the terms of the DOL rule, Roper says.\nThe Department of Labor\u2019s final fiduciary rule, released Wednesday, differed enough from the proposed version that the DOL felt compelled to publish a lengthy chart detailing where the two diverged.\nBy mitigating the harm of conflicts, firms will find they can no longer justify them, Roper said.\nAccording to a Morgan Stanley analyst, the Department of Labor \u201cmeaningfully softened\u201d the rule, and \u201cthat\u2019s good news for those companies.\"\nKnut Rostad, head of the Institute for the Fiduciary Standard, said \u201cfrom Wall Street reactions, it appears we are aligned agreeing the final rule has been significantly softened."}
