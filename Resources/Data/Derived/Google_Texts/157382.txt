HARTFORD, Conn. (WTNH) — Hartford HealthCare is eliminating the equivalent of 335 full-time jobs, which will affect 418 staff members, due to cuts in reimbursements.

Of the 418 people affected, 105 work in the eastern Connecticut hospitals, 71 work in central Connecticut hospitals, 68 work at Hartford Hospital, and 174 work outside hospitals.

This is the third round of layoffs in as many years for the company.

“Despite our best efforts to reduce costs and increase revenues this year, Hartford HealthCare faces additional Medicaid cuts, bringing our total Medicaid payment reductions from the State of Connecticut to more than $100 million over five years,” said Jeffrey A. Flaks, executive vice president and chief operating officer, in a letter to all staff on Wednesday.

Michelle Sharp, with the Connecticut Hospital Association, says the newest budget is devastating to hospitals who are already on the ropes.

“So the state budget as it stands today would impose a hospital tax of $350 million a year on hospitals and cut Medicaid and other programs by $58 million a year. That is going to have a huge negative impact on the hospitals, their patients, on their communities, on jobs, and on the economy, so it’s going to force hospitals to make some very difficult decisions,” she said.

Lawmakers are working towards a special secession to revisit the budget, but for now, Robbin, a healthcare worker, can’t believe the taxes and cuts.

“It hit home, but I’m not really thinking about myself, I’m thinking about the state as a whole,” she said.

Hartford healthcare says layoff notices will be sent out in the next few weeks.

In addition to the job cuts, Hartford HealthCare says it’s also looking at reducing and consolidating some programs and services to create additional efficiencies and lower costs. The company says specific details are still being worked out.
