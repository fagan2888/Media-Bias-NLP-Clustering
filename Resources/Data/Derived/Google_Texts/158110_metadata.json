Morial Convention Center to check out the daytime programming at over a dozen sponsor booths and Empowerment stages, while a select few hundred gathered in Hall I for McDonald\u2019s annual 365 Black Awards. There, even co-host Terrence J marveled at the sleepless resilience of the Essence crowd.\n\n\u201cDidn\u2019t I just see y\u2019all a few minutes ago at the Prince concert?\u201d\n\n\n\nAs R&B stars like Ledisi, Leela James, Jazmine Sullivan and Kem played musical tribute to community trailblazers like Rev. Al Sharpton and Iyanla Vanzant, Common and SZA were gearing up for another House of Blues show just a few hours later. So basically, if you had the stamina for it, you could have seen 14 straight hours of music in New Orleans on Saturday.\n\n\n\nLuckily, festivalgoers arrived well-rested to the Superdome for the third night, which hosted a lively Main Stage bill led by 12-time performer Mary J. Blige and SuperLounges filled with acts both new (Daley, Kourtney Heart) and nostalgic (Tevin Campbell, Doug E. Fresh, 112).\n\n\n\nRead on for minute-by-minute highlights from Day 3.\n\n\n\n8:42 p.m.: \u201cI hope you all came to get sufficiently ratchet.\u201d Those were Marsha Ambrosius\u2019 first words to the full house who came to see the first of two back-to-back sets she played at the Ford SuperLounge. But with her posh Liverpool accent, and a Sade cover on deck (\u201cLove Is Stronger Than Pride\u201d) to kick off the set, the vibe she began to set was decidedly cool and classy.\n\nMarsha Ambrosius performs at the 2014 Essence Music Festival on July 5, 2014 in New Orleans, Louisiana. Josh Brasted/Getty Images\n\nJosh Brasted/Getty Images\n\n8:53 p.m.: Barely two songs in, Ambrosius is already in a chatty mood, and has a few questions for her audience. \u201cHow many of y\u2019all believe friends can be lovers?\u201d A few crowd members clap, but their applause is drowned out by playful boos from the many monogamous romantics. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to judge, I\u2019m just saying my situation didn\u2019t work,\u201d Ambrosius says. \u201cIt\u2019s also the subject of my album, \u2018Friends and Lovers,\u2019 July 15 \u2013 plug plug plug.\u201d\n\n\n\n8:58 p.m.: With just her second solo album on the way, Ambrosius dug into her Floetry catalog on several occasions \u2013 much to the elation of her fans, who were recruited for their own vocals. \u201cI\u2019ve been coming here for 12 years straight. I don\u2019t bring no background singers,\u201d Ambrosius says before kicking off a medley of \u201cButterflies\u201d and Michael Jackson\u2019s \u201cI Can\u2019t Help It,\u201d which flowed seamlessly from the jazzy ballad. Jackson of course was the common thread between the two songs, having scored an early-aughts hit with his own version of \u201cButterflies.\u201d \u201cThat one\u2019s about a boy I had a crush on the way to McDonald\u2019s, so fine as hell. I was 17 years old,\u201d Ambrosius told the crowd.\n\n\n\n9:02 p.m.: \u201c\u2026Then you grow up and things change. My friends and lovers sound like this.\u201d The band struck up the opening chords of \u201c69,\u201d one of Ambrosius\u2019 most playfully explicit songs to date, in which couplets like \u201cF**k me till I forget that I\u2019m black out / throw my back out\u201d are among the tamer ones.\n\n\n\n9:07 p.m.: Ambrosius keeps the sass flowing with a rant about an annoying fan (\u201cshe\u2019s all up on me on Twitter like \u2018add me bitch, add me bitch.\u2019 You don\u2019t even know me like that, bitch\u201d) which serves as a fitting intro to her solo hit \u201cI Hope She Cheats On You (With A Basketball Player).\u201d The song would come off as a comedic novelty if it weren\u2019t so convincingly pained and spiteful. \u201cYou are the truth!\u201d shouts one woman, whose conversion to Ambrosius fandom appears to have just taken place.\n\n\n\n9:17 p.m.: After taking a dip through a New Orleans brass-y take on \u201cSexual Healing\u201d it\u2019s time for Ambrosius to close with the hits. First up is \u201cFar Away,\u201d which topped the Adult R&B charts in 2011. Last but not least is current single \u201cRun,\u201d which she dedicates to \u201cEveryone who just wants to get away. Just run towards your dreams.\u201d\n\n\n\n10:16 p.m.: It\u2019s not really the Essence Festival until at least one male performer takes off his shirt onstage. And at the Verizon SuperLounge, 112\u2019s Q Parker is up for the task. The ladies reach shriek levels unheard since Prince played \u201cPurple Rain\u201d the night before.\n\n\n\n10:24 p.m.: \u201cWe like to pay respect to those that came before us,\u201d 112\u2019s lead vocalist Slim says. \u201cAnd the first group that was really influential for us was Boyz II Men.\u201d True to their word, 112 runs through faithful renditions of three male vocalist group songs \u2013 \u201cOn Bended Knee,\u201d Jodeci\u2019s \u201cI Can\u2019t Leave You Alone\u201d and New Edition\u2019s \u201cCan You Stand The Rain.\u201d\n\n\n\n10:39 p.m.: \u201cHow many of y\u2019all remember when we signed to Bad Boy?\u201d Slim asks the crowd. \u201cThere was five acts \u2013 Faith [Evans], Craig Mack, Total, 112 and Notorious B.I.G. Now Big ain\u2019t here to rock wit us, but we need you to rock out wit us as if he was here. Can you do that for us Essence?\u201d Throughout hooks and key bars from \u201cSky\u2019s The Limit,\u201d \u201cJuicy,\u201d \u201cHypnotize,\u201d \u201cAll About The Benjamins\u201d and \u201cMo Money Mo Problems,\u201d the 112 fans prove they can, in fact, rock out for Biggie.\n\n\n\n10:50 p.m.: 112 have been careful not to label their last two years of touring again together a proper \u201creunion,\u201d which is perfect for rooms like the Essence SuperLounges. Dedicated fans get only the hits without those pesky new songs no one knows yet. And luckily, now it\u2019s time for \u201cPeaches & Cream\u201d and \u201cDance With Me,\u201d complete with the original choreography from the \u201cTRL\u201d-friendly videos, which a group of three fans has apparently committed to memory and performs along with the band from the crowd.\n\n\n\n11:06 p.m.: Back on the Main Stage, Jill Scott is checking her freedom. Perennial Essence favorite \u201cGolden\u201d has begun.\n\n\n\n11:10 p.m.: Webster\u2019s alert! \u201cIt is such a plivilege \u2013 plivilege, that\u2019s how you mix a word,\u201d Scott says, correcting her speech. \u201cPleasure and privilege.\u201d\n\n\n\n11:14 p.m.: Many performers at Essence will gladly take you to church, but only Jill Scott can take you to the opera house. With trepidation, she starts to tackle fan favorite \u201cHe Loves Me (Lyzel In E Flat),\u201d which climaxes with operatic trills only the classically trained could pull off \u2013 and ideally in better health than Scott\u2019s been in lately. \u201cI\u2019ve been sick, I don\u2019t know if I can sing anymore. Let\u2019s see if this happens. Thank you for your energy and support \u2013 wish me luck!\u201d\n\nJill Scott performs at at the 2014 Essence Music Festival on July 5, 2014 in New Orleans, Louisiana. Josh Brasted/Getty Images\n\nJosh Brasted/Getty Images\n\n11:16 p.m.: Turns out that luck wasn\u2019t needed \u2013 Scott is straight-up murdering those high notes. No wonder she struts off the stage wearing shades and sipping on some cognac three minutes later \u2013 she more than earned her place on the Main Stage for a second year in a row.\n\n\n\n11:37 p.m.: While the stage is being set for Mary J. Blige, it\u2019s time for a word from our sponsors. Actress and singer Taraji P. Henson is on-hand to introduce a trio of dancers who\u2019ve come to showcase State Farm\u2019s Better Style campaign. Performing to a brief set of crowd favorites, they naturally end with \u201cPoison.\u201d\n\n\n\n11:41 p.m.: Essence is the only festival where such blatant marketing from sponsors is not only unscrutinized, it\u2019s expected and welcomed. How else to explain the annual Main Stage appearance from Ronald McDonald and his good friend LeToya Luckett, who should probably find a new gig before the \u201cworking at McDonald\u2019s\u201d post-Destiny\u2019s Child jokes start writing themselves.\n\n\n\n11:43 p.m.: Up next on the sponsors with celebrities roll call is Coca-Cola, who trots out a big one \u2014 \u201890s jingle singer Tyrese, who credits the birth of his entire career to his iconic Coke ad, which like the Essence Festival itself, turned 20 this year. \u201cI was 16 years old when I stepped on that bus. I think the makeup person put a lot of grease on my lips, but we'll talk about that later. Nothing like a little chicken and cola.\u201d Tyrese then introduces a contest winner, Jacoby, who\u2019s been chosen to represent the voice of Coca-Cola for the new generation. But after the young vocalist leaves the stage, it\u2019s clear who the real star still is. \u201cIt's been 20 years, I can't believe it. Y\u2019all know black don't crack. I look like I just stepped off that bus.\u201d\n\n\n\n11:53 p.m.: \u201cIt's so good to be back,\u201d pipes a familiar voice from the stage. \u201cWe ain\u2019t done yet.\u201d It\u2019s Mary J. time.\n\n\n\n\n\n11:54 p.m.: Rising from a platform underneath the stage, Blige emerges as if she\u2019s just stepped off a yacht party in the Hamptons \u2013 a white jacket is draped over a short white jumpsuit that would be just as functional for a tennis match as it is now for a night of intensive body-rocking and emotive wails.\n\n\n\n11:57 p.m.: Wondering what the \u201cJ\u201d stands for? It\u2019s clearly jams, and Mary has an arsenal full of them at this point in her 12-album career. Who else can whip out \u201cThe One,\u201d \u201cJust Fine,\u201d \u201cReal Love\u201d and spit a few Biggie verses in under 10 minutes, all with the effortless precision of a Tim Howard block, like it\u2019s a trip to the grocery?\n\n\n\n12:08 a.m.: Still more jams \u2013 \u201cReminisce,\u201d \u201cYou Bring Me Joy,\u201d \u201cBe Happy\u201d and \u201cLoving You\u201d all pouring out like hot coffee.\n\n\n\n12:23 a.m.: I feel a ballad coming on. \u201cShare My World\u201d is up first, but it\u2019s \u201cTake Me As I Am\u201d \u2013 an overlooked highlight from 2005\u2019s \u201cThe Breakthrough\u201d \u2013 where Blige delivers her most impressive work thus far. By the time she\u2019s started growling \u201cnothing at all,\u201d over and over again, the whole Dome is ready to testify.\n\n12:40 a.m.: Though she\u2019s been turning out hit after hit for nearly an hour, and has only 30 minutes left to go, Blige is still a true diva, so an outfit change is afoot. She re-emerges in another sexy, sophisticated jumpsuit, this one a dark teal number with gold buttons and laced sleeves paired with stiletto black boots and a black fedora.\n\n\n\n12:46 a.m.: Nearly all of Blige\u2019s albums in her discography are represented tonight, and 2011\u2019s \u201cMy Life II\u201d gets a special showcase with \u201cIrreversible,\u201d which Blige works out into a jazzy frenzy, scat singing the bridge, \u201clet it burn, let it burn, let it burn\u201d as if she were playing a club in 1940s Harlem. Brand-new single \u201cSuitcase,\u201d from her just-released \u201cThink Like A Man Too\u201d soundtrack album, soon follows.\n\n\n\n12:56 a.m.: \u201cI know for sure that a whole lot of Mary J. Blige fans is in this building right now. You can always tell by this number right here.\u201d That number being \u201cI\u2019m Goin\u2019 Down,\u201d which the arena sings in its entirety for Blige while she adjusts her mic pack. Though she\u2019s been covering the Rose Royce classic for 20 years now, she still gets visibly emotional from the outpouring of love and reverence.\n\n\n\n1 a.m.: Having let the fans take the wheel for a minute, Blige is back to show everyone who\u2019s boss one last time with a riveting \u201cNo More Drama.\u201d Often hunched over, looking as if someone has just punched her in the gut, Blige is powerfully raw, as if she's found all-new meaning in the song's world-weary lyrics. At one point, she nearly drops to her knees to nail home a chorus but remains on her feet, thanks to the impossibly high stiletto heel. Even at 43, Blige is clearly still in peak form. \u201cI gotta keep fighting for my life, and you do too,\u201d she tells the crowd. \u201cThe higher the level, the bigger the devil.\u201d\n\n\n\n1:08 a.m.: The Dr. Dre-produced anthem \u201cFamily Affair\u201d is technically more of a party starter, but there\u2019s no reason it can\u2019t be repurposed as a set closer, especially when it gives the entire arena something to keep singing on the walk home. \u201cLet\u2019s get crunk \u2018cuz Mary\u2019s back,\u201d indeed.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Billboard", "description": "DEK: Highlights from Day 3 of the 20th annual Essence Festival in New Orleans.", "title": "Essence Festival 2014 Day 3 Highlights: Mary J.
