Editor's note: Benefits Selling's Broker of the Year finalists will be revealed Monday-Friday this week. Meet our first finalist.

Vic Troncalli isn't the kind of person who can retire. He tried it once, after a long and very successful career in the garment industry. He bought a place up in the North Carolina mountains and after six months, he says he was bored. So he obtained his real estate license and began purchasing REMAX franchises. That was a decent business for Troncalli â€” until the Great Recession sucker punched real estate in 2008.
