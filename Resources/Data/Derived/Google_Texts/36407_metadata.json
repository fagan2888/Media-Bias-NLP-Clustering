He should say that $18 trillion is too much, and that continued borrowing by the federal government is completely unsustainable. The only way to dig out of this hole is to stop borrowing, and, as president, he will not request or approve any future hike in the debt limit.\n\nHe should also allay fears on Wall Street that such an action will result in a default by ensuring that Washington, under his leadership, will continue to service the existing debt.\n\nAnd, lastly, he should characterize this action as a great opportunity to return to constitutionally limited government by cutting government spending and programs that never should have been started in the first place.\n\nIn 2008, I gave this same advice to a Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain. He used it in a debate and established himself as a frontrunner until questions about his personal life forced him to retire from the race.\n\nImagine, however, the power of Donald Trump\u2019s voice on this critical issue in 2015. He is already the unchallenged frontrunner in the GOP race. His every utterance grabs the attention of the media. And, this proposal is radical. It is as anti-establishment as his positions on illegal immigration and political correctness.\n\nI dare say that this third major pillar in his campaign to \u201cMake America Great, Again\u201d would make him next to unbeatable.\n\nI\u2019ve been working on this anti-debt campaign since 2011, shortly after the Republicans swept into power in the House of Representatives. I called it the \u201cNo More Red Ink Campaign.\u201d It has generated more than 1 million letters to Republican lawmakers in Washington so far. I pointed out that Republican approval was essential to Barack Obama\u2019s plans to continue borrowing and spending without restraint. All Republicans in Congress had to do \u2013 even in just one of the two houses they control \u2013 was to say no to more borrowing. Instead, they have provided Obama all of the resources he needed to launch Obamacare, fund Planned Parenthood, grow anti-business regulatory departments like the Environmental Protection Agency, push Common Core through the Department of Education and so on.\n\nExperience more of Joseph Farah\u2019s no-nonsense truth-telling in his books, audio and video products, featured in the WND Superstore\n\nDonald Trump, with the power of his platform, could make this issue a focus of national attention, propelling his candidacy forward with a new offensive front that would leave his competitors staggering.\n\nAnd, the neat thing about it? It\u2019s the right thing to do. It makes perfect sense. It\u2019s like a magic bullet politically. It solves the seemingly unsolvable problem of runaway growth of government, which inevitably brings with it restrictions in personal freedom and subjugates the legitimate powers of the states to Washington.\n\nI am persuaded that, if framed properly, this issue would make the Trump campaign unstoppable. He would not only increase his support among Republican voters but win over many disillusioned Democrats the way Ronald Reagan did in 1980 and 1984.\n\nTrump has been successful to date in this campaign because he has been bold. This is no time for him to stop.\n\nIt\u2019s time for him to expand his base by claiming the high moral ground on other big issues.\n\nLike it or not, America\u2019s spiraling, out-of-control debt is not only an issue the next president will have to deal with, it also represents a great opportunity for leadership in restoring the country\u2019s heritage of constitutionally limited government. And it\u2019s something the president can do singlehandedly \u2013 forcing Congress to make deep cuts in overspending, over-regulation and social engineering.\n\nIf you agree with me, make your voice heard by enlisting in the \u201cNo More Red Ink Campaign\u201d today. And I\u2019ll try to get the word to Donald Trump.\n\nMedia wishing to interview Joseph Farah, please contact media@wnd.com.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "Donald Trump has catapulted to the lead in the race for the Republican presidential nomination by focusing on two popular issues: Proposing the building of a wall along the Mexican border to stem the overwhelming influx of illegal immigration, Attacking the Stalinesque doctrine of \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d that increasingly inhibits freedom of expression in the U.S. [\u2026]", "title": "What Trump should do next", "url": "http://www.wnd.com/2015/08/what-trump-should-do-next/", "image": "http://www.wnd.com/files/2015/08/donald-trump2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 152299868169938}, "google-site-verification": "5iw1bKISvQcI1qRwIskRfer6GKV4jUf6LImfS9bhaeI", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "I am persuaded that, if framed properly, this issue would make the Trump campaign unstoppable.\nTrump has been successful to date in this campaign because he has been bold.\nBut it\u2019s time for Trump to open up a new offensive front.\nAnd I\u2019ll try to get the word to Donald Trump.\nIf I had his ear, as I have once or twice in the past, I would advise Trump to say, as the future president, he would refuse to raise the debt limit to force Washington to live within its means like every American family and business is forced to do."}
