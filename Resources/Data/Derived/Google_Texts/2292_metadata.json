An attached courtyard waiting area would allow homeless men who want overnight shelter to line up each afternoon in a safe area, outside public view.\n\nThe Land Use, Transportation and Infrastructure Committee approved the proposal 6-0.\n\nCouncilwoman Susan Shepherd abstained, saying she didn\u2019t feel comfortable voting until she had a chance to hear from businesses and other opponents in the Ballpark neighborhood who attended the meeting. The committee did not allow public comment.\n\nAt one point, Ballpark developer and resident David Tagieff interrupted the discussion. He said the council should have the courage to hold off on the proposal and avert making the area \u201cthe permanent center for homeless people forever\u201d in Denver.\n\nHe said later that the city instead should use the money to buy the mission\u2019s building and move it out of the neighborhood.\n\nIn coming weeks, the full council will consider the proposal.\n\nThe Denver Rescue Mission is working to raise $2.3 million to reimburse the city after the center opens early next year. The city would put that money toward a 24-hour \u201crest and resource\u201d center to be built elsewhere.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Homeless day center gets OK from Denver City Council panel", "title": "Homeless day center gets OK from Denver City Council panel", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/04/08/homeless-day-center-gets-ok-from-denver-city-council-panel/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140403_123823_Denver-Homeless-Center-footer.jpg", "height": 475}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140403_123823_Denver-Homeless-Center-footer.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-04-08T14:04:30+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T14:30:28+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc94d7\"", "article_summary": "A Denver City Council committee Tuesday approved the use of $8.6 million from a city development fund to buy property and build a community day center for the homeless.\nThe Denver Rescue Mission is working to raise $2.3 million to reimburse the city after the center opens early next year.\nThe project includes construction of the Lawrence Street Community Center \u2014 with a dining room, showers and bathrooms \u2014 adjacent to the Denver Rescue Mission.\nThe city would put that money toward a 24-hour \u201crest and resource\u201d center to be built elsewhere.\nHe said the council should have the courage to hold off on the proposal and avert making the area \u201cthe permanent center for homeless people forever\u201d in Denver."}
