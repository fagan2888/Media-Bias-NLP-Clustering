Bush, Liberals, Tea Party, Politics News\n\nFifty years after its underlying polling was done, \u201cThe Political Beliefs of Americans\u201d by Lloyd Free and Hadley Cantril remains the starting point for anyone who wants to understand the big picture of American political opinion. But a new report on political polarization from Pew adds important new information, even as it leaves some questions tantalizingly unanswered and/or underanalyzed. Most notably, the twin issues of what\u2019s driving polarization and how symmetric or asymmetric it is remain to be fully explored, while the greatest locus of continued agreement is overlooked.\n\nIn a section titled \u201cIs Polarization Asymmetrical?\u201d the study first suggests that Democrats are driving the process, before introducing two caveats. This finding is simply not credible in the America described by Norm Ornstein and Thomas Mann in \u201cIt\u2019s Even Worse Than It Looks: How the American Constitutional System Collided With the New Politics of Extremism,\u201d or, more basically, in the system that\u2019s produced the sharp rightward trend in roll call voting among congressional Republicans since 1980 (as mapped by the DW-Nominate scores of Keith Poole and colleagues) compared to a relatively modest leftward drift among Democrats. [House mean, Senate mean.] Moreover, Pew\u2019s report itself contains a variety of contradictory information \u2014 not least the fact that the most consistent liberals are the people who most want political leaders willing to compromise.\n\nWhile others have written extensively about Pew\u2019s new report, I\u2019d like to focus more on questions raised, on what\u2019s not resolved, and that requires an initial discussion of why Free and Cantril remain relevant to this day. Their most innovative approach was the use of three different frameworks \u2014 an ideological spectrum based on questions about government intrusion vs. individual self-reliance and the free market, an operational spectrum based on support for specific government spending programs, and self-identification as liberal, conservative or middle of the road. A key finding was that 50 percent of Americans were ideological conservatives, while 65 percent of Americans were operational liberals \u2014 an overwhelming supermajority. More particularly, this psychological split manifested within the ranks of ideological conservatives: 46 percent of them were operational liberals, compared to just 26 percent who were operational conservatives. Thus, when you hear Tea Party Republicans say, \u201cKeep the government\u2019s hands off my Medicare!\u201d what you\u2019re actually hearing is just the tip of an iceberg that Free and Cantril were the first to discover and begin exploring.\n\nThe ideological and operational spectrums paint starkly different pictures of America \u2014 with the self-identification scale falling in between, with a 38 percent plurality calling themselves middle of the road. One consequence of these two pictures was a suggested difference in how to identify core liberals and conservatives. Since so many people supported spending more money on the operational questions, the relatively small fraction who don\u2019t are prime candidates for the conservative label. Similarly, since so many people opposed government intervention on principle, those who don\u2019t are prime candidates for the liberal label. It makes sense to define these ideologies in different terms, because that\u2019s what produces relatively compact groups with coherent policy views on both sides.\n\nCompared to Free and Cantril, Pew\u2019s handling of the ideological spectrum represents a dramatic improvement in two fundamental ways: First, they\u2019ve created an ideological consistency scale that includes a broader range of issues, including questions on race, immigration, foreign policy, homosexuality and the environment \u2014 several of which weren\u2019t even salient political issues in 1964. Second, their questions are framed by presenting two contrasting positions and ask people to choose between them, whereas Free and Cantril presented one statement, and asked people to agree or disagree \u2014 a practice now widely understood as biased toward agreement. What\u2019s more, Pew uses its ideological consistency scale in a gradiated manner \u2014 consistent or mostly liberal or conservative, with a mixed category in the middle \u2014 which mirrors Free and Cantril\u2019s scale of complete or predominant ideologues, with a middle-of-the-road category between them, and Pew uses this scale consistently and creatively throughout its study.\n\nDespite Pew\u2019s excellent use of its ideological consistency scale, it\u2019s important to understand what\u2019s not being captured in its analysis: the operational level, which is where much higher levels of agreement still reside. As an example of how ideological value statement questions differ from operational spending questions, consider what Pew has to say regarding spending on the poor, after noting that partisan divides have deepened on nearly every measure in the ideological consistency scale:\n\nFor instance, while Democrats have always been more supportive than Republicans of the social safety net, the partisan divide on these questions has increased substantially over the last 20 years. Two-thirds of Republicans (66%) believe that \u201cpoor people today have it easy because they can get government benefits without doing anything in return;\u201d just 25% say \u201cpoor people have hard lives because government benefits don\u2019t go far enough to help them live decently.\u201d Among Democrats, just 28% believe the poor have it easy. The partisan gap on this measure is now 38 points, up from 19 points in 1994 and 26 points in 2004.\n\nThings look dramatically different, however, if we look at specific spending questions. I prefer those on the General Social Survey (GSS \u2014 online archive here), which is considered the gold standard of public opinion polling in the U.S. GSS spending questions ask if we are spending \u201ctoo much,\u201d \u201ctoo little\u201d or \u201cabout right.\u201d In 2012 \u2014 the last date GSS data is available \u2014 52.3 percent of Republicans thought we were spending \u201ctoo little\u201d on the poor, compared to 23.1 percent who thought we were spending \u201ctoo much.\u201d That\u2019s almost exactly the reverse of the picture Pew painted above \u2014 a perfect illustration of the ideological/operational divide that Free and Cantril first observed in 1964 survey data.\n\nIf we ask about \u201cwelfare,\u201d views are decidedly more negative because the term itself is so pejorative. Even liberals tend to think we\u2019re spending \u201ctoo much\u201d rather than \u201ctoo little\u201d in most years. But even support for spending on welfare skyrockets if we shift our focus even closer to the ground. In 1986, GSS included a special module of questions presenting people with different scenarios of families in need, asking how much support they should receive. The results were presented in detail in \u201cThe Deserving Poor\u201d by Jeffry A. Will. Broken down into nine regions nationally, one of Will\u2019s charts showed that the average levels of support people thought appropriate exceeded the actual levels of support by 2-to-1 or better in all but one region, where it was just slightly less than 2-to-1. In one region \u2014 the East South Central \u2014 the average level of support people thought appropriate was $265/month, more than 10 times the lowest level of actual support for one of the states in the region.\n\nThis study clearly indicates that the ideological/operational divide that Free and Cantril discovered only gets more extreme, as the operational questions become more concrete, more rooted in questions of specific need. At the \u201chyper-operational\u201d level that Will explored, virtually everyone is a liberal, compared to existing policy.\n\nAs for the kind of trend data Pew cited in the passage above, we can compare GSS\u2019s spending question trend using the so-called liberalism index, to get a single number to measure support \u2014 the number saying we\u2019re spending \u201ctoo little\u201d by the number saying \u201ctoo little\u201d or \u201ctoo much.\u201d In contrast to Pew\u2019s ideological findings, between 1994 and 2012, both liberals and conservatives became more supportive of spending on the poor and on welfare, though the gap between them did widen, because liberal support increased more. The gap increased 9.8 percent for spending on welfare, from 17.1 percent in 1994 to 26.9 percent in 2012. So the gap widened much less \u2014 barely over half the change in Pew\u2019s measure \u2014 and did so entirely because liberals became more supportive more rapidly than conservatives did, not because conservatives grew less supportive (they didn\u2019t). The gap increased even less, 5.1 percent for spending on the poor, from 19.7 percent in 1994 to 24.9 percent in 2012.\n\nMore broadly, on 25 GSS spending questions, the \u201cliberalism index\u201d moved in the same direction for both liberals and conservatives on 17 items \u2014 more than two-thirds of them. It only moved in the opposite direction on eight of them. On those eight, the conservative movement averaged 7.7 percent more conservative, compared to 6.8 percent more liberal on the other side. So, on the minority of items where liberals and conservatives moved in the opposite direction, conservatives moved more on average than liberals did. This markedly different and more nuanced array of shifting opinions shows the continued importance of the ideological vs. operational view of American politics, as well as the greater degree of agreement on the operational level. Pew\u2019s considerable advances in developing a more sophisticated understanding of the ideological dimension cry out for a comparable level of work on the operational dimension \u2014 and, most important, on the interactions and inter-relations between the two.\n\nBut what about the questions I raised earlier, about the twin issues of what\u2019s driving polarization and how symmetric or asymmetric it is? Here Pew hews toward a \u201cbalance narrative\u201d approach, in which \u201cboth sides do it\u201d more or less equally. But its own reported findings undercut that narrative, as does other available evidence.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s take a closer look at what Pew reported in a section titled \u201cIs Polarization Asymmetrical?\u201d Here, Pew singles out the long-term leftward shift among Democrats as \u201cparticularly noteworthy\u201d:\n\nThe share of Democrats who are liberal on all or most value dimensions has nearly doubled from just 30% in 1994 to 56% today. The share who are consistently liberal has quadrupled from just 5% to 23% over the past 20 years. In absolute terms, the ideological shift among Republicans has been more modest, in 1994, 45% of Republicans were right-of-center, with 13% consistently conservative. Those figures are up to 53% and 20% today.\n\nPew then goes on to say, \u201cthere are two key considerations to keep in mind before concluding that the liberals are driving ideological polarization.\u201d First is that 1994 was a relative high point in Republican conservatism, as Republicans moved \u201csubstantially toward the center ideologically\u201d from 1994 to 2004, \u201cas concern about the deficit, government waste and abuses of social safety net that characterized the \u2018Contract With America\u2019 era faded in the first term of the Bush administration,\u201d after which \u201cRepublicans have veered sharply back to the right on all of these dimensions,\u201d so the GOP\u2019s rightward shift \u201cover the past decade has matched, if not exceeded, the rate at which Democrats have become more liberal.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Democratic Party is not as liberal as it was.
