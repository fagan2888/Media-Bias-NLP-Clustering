LM Otero/Associated Press\n\nThe Republican Study Committee unveiled its blueprint for overhauling U.S. health-care if the Supreme Court cripples the federal health law in a decision expected later this month.\n\nThe official plan from the group of 170 House conservatives would repeal the entire 2010 Affordable Care Act starting Jan. 1, 2016. It would then replace the ACA\u2019s centerpiece tax credits to help low and modest income people pay premiums and its requirements that insurers sell coverage to everyone regardless of their medical history with tax deductions and new insurance plans for people with pre-existing conditions.\n\nUnder the RSC plan, individuals would get a standard tax deduction of $7,500 a year, rising to $20,500 for families, for buying health insurance. That would apply to everyone with private insurance, including the majority of Americans under the age of 65 who get coverage through a job.\n\nSome Republicans, including 2008 presidential nominee Sen. John McCain, have long favored the idea, arguing it\u2019s good tax policy, gives everyone the same choices, and doesn\u2019t give people incentives to buy more expensive insurance.\n\nIt\u2019s been a tough to sell, however, to people with employer-sponsored insurance since their insurance benefit would likely change considerably. Lower-income Americans would likely get less help buying coverage than they do from the health law\u2019s current system of premium subsidies, and people who pick more expensive health plans would also likely pay a lot more.\n\nThe plan wouldn\u2019t revive the ACA\u2019s requirements that insurers let everyone buy coverage equally, sick or healthy. Instead, it brings back state high-risk pools, widely used before the health law \u2014 and still in operation in some parts of the country \u2014 to deal with insurers\u2019 refusals to sell coverage to people with pre-existing conditions. The pools would get $25 billion in federal funds over 10 years and would be required to cap premiums at twice the amount of the average premium in the state.\n\nRep. Phil Roe of Tennessee is set to introduce the plan as legislation Thursday morning, and 31 members of the group are signed on as the first sponsors.\n\nThe plan has much in common with previous health-care proposals from the committee. Its reappearance comes weeks before the court rules on the validity of the health law\u2019s subsidies in some three dozen states.\n\nFor weeks, GOP lawmakers have been offering responses to the possibility the court could void the health law\u2019s tax credits for people who buy insurance coverage through the federal exchange, HealthCare.gov. As we reported earlier this week, there will be no effort by leaders to gather the party behind a single plan until after the court rules.\n\nSen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin\u2019s plan would extend the tax credits through August 2017 and repeal most of the rest of the law, most notably the requirements for insurance to offer a list of essential benefits that have made premiums higher. Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana has sought to build on that with an idea that would let states take money they would have received under the law and give it to their residents to pay for health insurance in other ways, primarily health savings accounts.\n\nSenate leaders John Barrasso of Wyoming, Lamar Alexander of Tennessee and Orrin Hatch of Utah have said they want to preserve credits in the short term and then let states take over most of the rules for how insurance should be priced and sold if they want. House leaders Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, John Kline of Minnesota and Fred Upton of Michigan have come out in favor of new, advanceable and refundable tax credits.\n\n\u2013Kristina Peterson contributed to this post.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "The Republican Study Committee unveiled its blueprint for overhauling U.S. health care.", "title": "House GOP Group Unveils Plan for Replacing Obamacare", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2015/06/04/house-gop-group-unveils-plan-for-replacing-obamacare/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-IH701_acaenr_P_20150507164550.jpg"}, "site": "WSJPolitics", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Politics", "article.headline": "House GOP Group Unveils Plan for Replacing Obamacare", "description": "The Republican Study Committee unveiled its blueprint for overhauling U.S. health care.", "article_section": "Politics", "author": "Louise Radnofsky", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Washington Wire Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Washington Wire", "article.summary": "The Republican Study Committee unveiled its blueprint for overhauling U.S. health care.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2015-06-04T11:00:38-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-161", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2015/06/04/house-gop-group-unveils-plan-for-replacing-obamacare/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-WB-55683", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Politics", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "The Republican Study Committee unveiled its blueprint for overhauling U.S. health care.", "title": "House GOP Group Unveils Plan for Replacing Obamacare", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2015/06/04/house-gop-group-unveils-plan-for-replacing-obamacare/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-IH701_acaenr_P_20150507164550.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Washington Wire", "article.id": "BL-WB-55683", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2015-06-04T12:04:59-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7dad\"", "article_summary": "House leaders Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, John Kline of Minnesota and Fred Upton of Michigan have come out in favor of new, advanceable and refundable tax credits.\nThe official plan from the group of 170 House conservatives would repeal the entire 2010 Affordable Care Act starting Jan. 1, 2016.\nUnder the RSC plan, individuals would get a standard tax deduction of $7,500 a year, rising to $20,500 for families, for buying health insurance.\nLM Otero/Associated PressThe Republican Study Committee unveiled its blueprint for overhauling U.S. health-care if the Supreme Court cripples the federal health law in a decision expected later this month.\nIt\u2019s been a tough to sell, however, to people with employer-sponsored insurance since their insurance benefit would likely change considerably."}
