Sestak has a reputation as being hard-headed so it's no surprise that he has promised to double down on his support for the liberal policies that led to his loss in 2010 and put him comfortably in the progressive wing of the Democratic Party.\n\nOne of Rep. Nancy Pelosi's trusted foot soldiers from 2006-10, Sestak enthusiastically supported each big spending initiative the Democratic Congress rolled out, only voicing concern when he felt the policies were not liberal enough. Sestak voted for the $787 billion stimulus, but was disappointed it did not spend $1 trillion. He was a high-profile cheerleader for Obamacare, but expressed regret that the final version had no public option. During Sestak's tenure the House also passed an energy tax, which would've made electricity prices jump, cost thousands of jobs, and was too liberal to get passed by a Senate controlled by a Democratic super majority. Predictably, Joe Sestak said this cap-and-trade bill should have gone further.\n\nThese liberal credentials might be a badge of honor in Vermont or Massachusetts. However, in large and diverse Pennsylvania, Sestak's double-down campaign looks to be one of willful ignorance.\n\nLois Daday\n\nLower Saucon Township", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Sestak's positions bad for Pennsylvania", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 The Morning Call", "author": "The Morning Call", "og": {"site_name": "themorningcall.com", "description": "Joe Sestak , a former two-term congressman, is trying to run for the U.S. Senate again in 2016.
