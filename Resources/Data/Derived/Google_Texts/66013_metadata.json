It\u2019s an every Saturday morning event in Greenville, but Saturday was special, as most of the customers took time to meet and chat with Carson.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nIn an exclusive interview with Breitbart News, Carson said that small businesses are an important issue for the election and America\u2019s economy.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a huge issue everywhere because people have insinuated themselves into the small business arena and try to control them,\u201d he told Breitbart News.\n\n\u201cOne of the real strengths of America in the past has been mom and pop and anybody who on the basis of their talent was able to expand as far as they want to go,\u201d Carson said.\n\n\u201cNow, they can only expand up to fifty employees before they have significant consequences. That\u2019s no good. That\u2019s not going to help us as America,\u201d he added referencing the employer mandate enacted by Obamacare.\n\n\u201cThat has to be fixed, and it\u2019s one of the many things that\u2019s impeding the economy,\u201d he said.\n\nChancey Lindsey-Peake, owner of Banana Manna, launched her business eight years ago. \u201cWe started out from very humble beginnings,\u201d she told Breitbart News. \u201cWe started out with a borrowed kitchen\u2013rented kitchen\u2013and now, we are at our present location \u2026 for two and a half years now.\u201d\n\nLindsey-Peake and Carson both share a strong belief in their faiths.\n\n\u201cMy faith is what\u2019s got me where I am. There was a time in my life where I did everything but trust God. Now, it\u2019s all about God,\u201d she said. \u201cI went down a wrong path [and] found myself incarcerated\u2013and glory be to God\u2013my parents raised me in church, so then, when I got in that dark place, I knew who to call on.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you believe that God would do what He said He will do, doors will open for you, if you believe,\u201d she added. \u201cDr. Ben Carson\u2013I just began to listen about his message and what he is about.\u201d\n\nSouth Carolina voter Lorando Lockhart, who was attending the street fair, also approached Carson and asked him what he plans to do to help homeless veterans.\n\nCarson said veterans should be able to go to any hospital of their choosing.\n\n\u201cWhy should they have to go sixty miles out of the way to go to a veterans [hospital]? That doesn\u2019t make any sense,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cThey shouldn\u2019t have to worry about anything, and we need to start thinking about them at the time they enlist, not after they get out,\u201d Carson said, adding that would help prevent post-traumatic stress.\n\n\u201cWe just have to look at the whole big picture and realize that without our veterans, we wouldn\u2019t have our freedom,\u201d Carson said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Dr. Ben Carson, GOP presidential candidate, walked down Main Street in Greenville, SC, to the South Carolina Freedom Summit.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Dr. Ben Carson, GOP presidential candidate, walked down Main Street in Greenville, SC, to the South Carolina Freedom Summit.", "title": "EXCLUSIVE-Ben Carson: Mom and Pop Small Businesses Are 'Real Strengths of America' - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/04/ben_carson-ReutersJonathan-Ernst.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/05/09/exclusive-ben-carson-mom-and-pop-small-businesses-are-real-strengths-of-america/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Dr. Ben Carson, GOP presidential candidate, walked down Main Street in Greenville, SC, to the South Carolina Freedom Summit.", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/04/ben_carson-ReutersJonathan-Ernst.jpg", "title": "EXCLUSIVE-Ben Carson: Mom and Pop Small Businesses Are 'Real Strengths of America' - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "2016 Republican Primary, Dr. Ben Carson, economy, small business, South Carolina Freedom Summit,2016 Presidential Race, Big Government,Carson", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "tag": "South Carolina Freedom Summit", "published_time": "2015-05-09T10:28:28-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "Carson, a retired neurosurgeon, spoke with the voters attending Artisphere, a street fair where hundreds of small business owners hosted booths showcasing their goods.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a huge issue everywhere because people have insinuated themselves into the small business arena and try to control them,\u201d he told Breitbart News.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERIn an exclusive interview with Breitbart News, Carson said that small businesses are an important issue for the election and America\u2019s economy.\n\u201cOne of the real strengths of America in the past has been mom and pop and anybody who on the basis of their talent was able to expand as far as they want to go,\u201d Carson said.\n\u201cWe just have to look at the whole big picture and realize that without our veterans, we wouldn\u2019t have our freedom,\u201d Carson said."}
