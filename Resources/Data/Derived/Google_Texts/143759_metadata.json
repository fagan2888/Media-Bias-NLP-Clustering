And he made clear the riots that broke out after Gray\u2019s funeral need to stop.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t condone the violence we see in Baltimore. But we must not ignore the despair and hopelessness that gives rise to this kind of violence,\u201d Reid said in his speech. \u201cWhen there is no hope, anger and despair move in. That\u2019s the way it is. We can\u2019t ignore that. So let\u2019s condemn the violence but not ignore the underlying problem.\u201d\n\nBut Reid also said he identifies with the feeling of hopelessness pervading West Baltimore, and other cities across the country where clashes with authorities have broken out after young black men have died following confrontations with police in Staten Island, New York, North Charleston, South Carolina, and Ferguson, Missouri.\n\n\u201cFreddie Gray will not be forgotten. This young man\u2019s death is the latest in a series of disturbing and unnecessary deaths of young men of color at the hands of police and vigilantes,\u201d Reid said. \u201cIt is easy to believe the system is rigged against you when you spent years watching what President Obama called a slow-rolling crisis of troubling police interactions with people of color.\u201d\n\nObama earlier on Tuesday said America has some \u201csoul searching\u201d to do if it wants to break the cycle of deadly confrontations between police and the communities they serve. He said more must be done to lift impoverished communities by providing better educational and economic opportunities.\n\nReid spent Tuesday talking with staff about what to say about Gray\u2019s death and the unrest in Baltimore. And he twice declined to address the events in his weekly press conference, where he normally engages on any issue that reporters bring up.\n\nReid, who grew up in the crushing poverty of Searchlight, Nevada, said the country shouldn\u2019t assume that poor people have the same chances of success today. The sense that there\u2019s no ladder to success is gripping large swaths of the United States, Reid added.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s not pretend the path from poverty like the one I traveled is still available to everyone out there as long as they work hard,\u201d he said.\n\nIn contrast to Reid\u2019s remarks, which emphasized a lack of opportunity in poor communities and the treatment of minorities by police, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) focused on bringing rioters to justice in remarks to reporters.\n\n\u201cObviously our hearts go out to those who\u2019ve been injured and the other activities that have occurred there that are so regretful. I hope the investigation into illegal behavior will be concluded soon and those that engaged in criminal behavior will be promptly pursued and charged,\u201d McConnell said.\n\nThough it never came to a vote when he controlled the Senate, Reid urged passage of criminal justice reform legislation that attempts to reverse decades of disproportionate jailing of minorities. But he called that only a start, and he panned McConnell\u2019s economic agenda and claimed that an extension of transportation funding is the only thing on the Senate\u2019s horizon that would create jobs.\n\nNotably, Reid opposes new trade deals that proponents says would help create opportunity and raise wages.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing else. Look around. That\u2019s not enough. We need to do more. It\u2019s up to us here in this Capitol to create these jobs,\u201d Reid said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "He urges Congress to do something about the lack of opportunity in rural and urban America.", "title": "Reid: 'Despair and hopelessness' feed community violence", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/04/harry-reid-baltimore-117434.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2015/04/28/150428_reid_ap_1160.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Baltimore,Civil Rights,Harry Reid,Baltimore Protests,Police,Freddie Gray,Maryland", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "He urges Congress to do something about the lack of opportunity in rural and urban America.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "But we must not ignore the despair and hopelessness that gives rise to this kind of violence,\u201d Reid said in his speech.\nReid: 'Despair and hopelessness' feed community violenceWith the ongoing turmoil in Baltimore as a backdrop, Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid urged Congress to do something about the lack of opportunity in rural and urban America.\nThough it never came to a vote when he controlled the Senate, Reid urged passage of criminal justice reform legislation that attempts to reverse decades of disproportionate jailing of minorities.\nReid spent Tuesday talking with staff about what to say about Gray\u2019s death and the unrest in Baltimore.\nStory Continued Below\u201cWe can\u2019t condone the violence we see in Baltimore."}
