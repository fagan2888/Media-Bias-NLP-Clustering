However, enquiries into the cost of insuring the event revealed that they would most likely be required to take out \u00a3250 million of cover, at a cost of \u00a350,000 making the whole thing untenable.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nPaul Beaver, who was organising the event, told the Telegraph: \u201cThe intention was that 20 privately-owned Spitfires would fly over London to mark the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain. We had started the planning in March, and had applied to the Civil Aviation Authority and even the Prime Minister to get the go-ahead.\n\n\u201cThe route we were going to take would have made sure there was always somewhere for an aircraft to land if it got into difficulties, and usually the individual owners\u2019 aircraft insurance, which provides \u00a35 million of third party cover per aircraft, would have been enough.\n\n\u201cBut after Shoreham we took soundings from an insurance expert who advises the air shows, and he said the feedback he was getting from underwriters was that we would need to take out \u00a3250 million of insurance cover, which made the whole thing untenable.\n\n\u201cI really hope the underwriters take a pragmatic view when the air show season starts next year, because if they don\u2019t it will make life very difficult.\u201d\n\nAn unrelated flyby featuring a number of fighter planes will still go ahead over the south coast to mark the anniversary on September 15th.\n\nOn 22nd August Shoreham air-show was called off after one of the aircraft taking part in the display smashed into queuing traffic on the busy A27 south coast road, erupting in a ball of flame. Britain\u2019s Civil Aviation Authority has now put \u201csignificant\u201d restrictions on airshows, with displays by vintage jets now limited to flypasts, with skills aerial acrobatics forbidden.\n\nThree weeks previously, ex-RAF pilot Kevin Whyman, 35, was killed at CarFest, hosted by TV celebrity Chris Evans, when his plane nosedived during a stunt display.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Battle of Britain Fly-Past Cancelled As Insurance Costs Spiral Following Shoreham Crash", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Battle of Britain Fly-Past Cancelled As Insurance Costs Spiral Following Shoreham Crash", "title": "Battle of Britain Fly-Past Cancelled As Insurance Costs Spiral Following Shoreham Crash", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 3000, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/09/GettyImages-484398848.jpg", "height": 1659}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/london/2015/09/07/battle-of-britain-fly-past-cancelled-as-insurance-costs-spiral-following-shoreham-crash/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Battle of Britain Fly-Past Cancelled As Insurance Costs Spiral Following Shoreham Crash", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/09/GettyImages-484398848.jpg", "title": "Battle of Britain Fly-Past Cancelled As Insurance Costs Spiral Following Shoreham Crash", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "battle of britain, Civil Aviation, plane crash, shoreham airshow,Breitbart London,battle of britain", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Breitbart London", "tag": "shoreham airshow", "published_time": "2015-09-07T04:17:19-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart London"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb1f0\"", "article_summary": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERA Battle of Britain commemorative flypast by 20 spitfires has been cancelled thanks to the prohibitive cost of insurance following the disastrous crash at Shoreham Airshow last month, in which 11 people lost their lives.\nThe event was being privately organised by a group of Spitfire owners, had planned to fly over London to mark the 75th anniversary of the historic battle.\nBritain\u2019s Civil Aviation Authority has now put \u201csignificant\u201d restrictions on airshows, with displays by vintage jets now limited to flypasts, with skills aerial acrobatics forbidden.\n\u201cBut after Shoreham we took soundings from an insurance expert who advises the air shows, and he said the feedback he was getting from underwriters was that we would need to take out \u00a3250 million of insurance cover, which made the whole thing untenable.\nWe had started the planning in March, and had applied to the Civil Aviation Authority and even the Prime Minister to get the go-ahead."}
