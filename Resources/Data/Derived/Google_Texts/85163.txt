All week long ELLE.com is looking at the issues surrounding pumping.

Since the passing of the Affordable Care Act in 2010, employers (most employers, anyway), have been required to provide new mothers with a place to pump in the office. Specifically, a space "other than a bathroom, that is shielded from view and free from intrusion from coworkers and the public," according to the law. But when's the last time you heard a woman sing the praises of her office's lactation room? The truth is most are mediocre and many are utterly terrible, and too few of us are making a fuss about it.

We reached out to over 40 companies and asked them to let us peek inside a typical lactation room No surprise: many declined. Some admitted they didn't have dedicated spaces; many (about 35 percent, according to our outreach) are currently—what do you know!—renovating. (FYI: Allyson Downey, author of Here's the Plan and founder of WeeSpring, put together this list to help workplaces create well equipped lactation spaces. Hello, employers! Read it!)

To set a better example, we wanted to showcase some of the good ones. Are there more employers out there that are taking care of working mothers? We sincerely hope so. Let us know. We invite you to tweet us your own @elleusa using the hashtag #fromwhereipump.
