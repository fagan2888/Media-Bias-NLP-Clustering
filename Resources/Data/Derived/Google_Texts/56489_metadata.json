But it\u2019s not true. Not by a long shot.\n\nPresident Obama\u2019s top economists, Jeff Zients and Jason Furman, claim that the new Medicare Trustees Report \u201cconfirms the major progress that has been made in recent years in improving the financial position of the Medicare program.\u201d\n\nMedicare\u2019s Hospital Insurance Trust Fund will remain solvent until 2030, they say, which is 13 years longer than it was before ObamaCare. Plus, they say, growth in per-beneficiary spending was just 2.3% last year, \u201cless than one-half of the 5.5 average rate from 2000 to 2010.\u201d\n\nBut this sunny outlook doesn\u2019t stand up to even the slightest scrutiny.\n\nMedicare is still a fiscal time bomb. As the nearby chart shows, its hospital insurance deficits will hit $110 billion in 2031 \u2014 the first year after its trust fund runs out of money. Annual deficits will eventually top $1 trillion a year.\n\nEven that is a fantasy, since it assumes ObamaCare\u2019s steep Medicare provider payment cuts actually happen. Even Medicare\u2019s trustees are skeptical.\n\nBuried in an appendix, the report admits that \u201cthere is substantial uncertainty\u201d regarding the likelihood that those cuts will be feasible.\n\nThey are so deep, the report says, that what Medicare pays will \u201cfall increasingly below providers\u2019 costs.\u201d By 2019, for example, as many as 15% of hospitals will have negative Medicare margins, it says. And the only way to avoid such massive losses would be for doctors and hospitals to \u201cgenerate and sustain unprecedented levels of productivity gains.\u201d\n\nWashington has already shown that it won\u2019t swallow such Medicare cuts. Soon after a 1997 payment cut plan \u2014 called \u201cSustainable Growth Rate\u201d \u2014 went into effect, Congress repeatedly nullified it. In the likely event that Congress cancels the ObamaCare-imposed cuts, then \u201cthe actual future costs for Medicare may exceed the projections shown in this report, possibly by substantial amounts,\u201d the trustees say.\n\nMedicare remains in financial jeopardy and is in need of serious reform. Any politician who pretends otherwise is doing taxpayers and retirees a huge disservice.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Entitlements: Medicare's latest annual report, issued days before its 50th anniversary, seems to show that, thanks to ObamaCare, it has a long and healthy", "og": {"site_name": "Investor's Business Daily", "description": "Entitlements: Medicare\u2019s latest annual report, issued days before its 50th anniversary, seems to show that, thanks to ObamaCare, it has a long and healthy future in front of it.
