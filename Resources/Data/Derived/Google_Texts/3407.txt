Rush Limbaugh is releasing a children's book.

No, that part's not a joke.

Limbaugh's book, entitled Rush Revere and the Brave Pilgrims: Time-Travel Adventures with Exceptional Americans, is exactly what it sounds like. According to the controversial right-wing radio mogul, this is what the book is about:

“Rush Revere is a substitute school teacher at a middle school anywhere in America, and he will take a couple of students with him to the first Thanksgiving, and they will learn all about it.”

So, there's that.

Why stop there, Rush? We have some more ideas for books you can (and should) write so you can teach a whole new generation of dittoheads that liberals are out to destroy them before they graduate junior high.
