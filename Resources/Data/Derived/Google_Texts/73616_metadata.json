Scott Walker delivered his State of the State address in January 2013, he promised that an agenda of budget cutting, reduced taxes and less business regulation would result in a better economic climate and more jobs for his state.\n\n\u201cUnlike the message coming out of Washington, I believe that putting more money in the hands of the people \u2014 instead of the government \u2014 is good for the economy,\u201d said the Republican governor, who is known as a reformer.\n\nRelated: 10 Cities with Booming Job Growth\n\nWalker is just one of several Republican governors who, with the help of friendly Republican-dominated state legislatures, have spent the past few years slashing taxes \u2013 particularly on businesses \u2013 and cutting spending. States like Kansas and North Carolina have undertaken similar efforts, and at least in part, the justification has usually been that lowering the tax burden will attract new businesses, which will in turn create new jobs.\n\nIn 2012, Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback wrote that his state\u2019s tax cuts would be \u201clike a shot of adrenaline into the heart of the Kansas economy\u201d that would \u201cpave the way to the creation of tens of thousands of new jobs, bring tens of thousands of people to Kansas, and help make our state the best place in America to start and grow a small business.\u201d\n\nIn July of 2013, North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory made similar promises when he signed a bill lowering personal and corporate tax rates, and cutting state spending.\n\n\u201cThis reform will put money in the pockets of North Carolinians,\u201d McCrory said. \u201cIt sends a positive signal to our citizens and most of all to job creators that North Carolina is open for business. Our goal is to get people in jobs and back to work.\u201d\n\nRelated: Good Jobs Report Leaves Many Millennials Out\n\nOn its face, it seems like a no-brainer. If a business is looking to relocate, all things being equal, a state that is going to take less of its profits in taxes is going to be more attractive. The \u201cHow Money Walks,\u201d website, for instance, is dedicated to tracking the migration of individuals from high-tax to low-tax states.\n\nThe trouble is that the promised job growth hasn\u2019t really materialized.\n\nTo be sure, with the U.S. economy as a whole adding jobs at a pace of 250,000 per month, there aren\u2019t many states seeing a downturn in employment anymore. But the promises that went along with the tax cuts and reduced spending weren\u2019t about keeping up with the rest of the country, but about surging ahead.\n\nWalker, for one, predicted not just job growth, but growth that would outpace neighboring states like Illinois and Michigan. McCrory and the North Carolina legislature made sure that their state\u2019s tax rates were cut to a level below that of its neighbors for a similar reason.\n\nRelated: No Job Loss in Most States That Raised Minimum Wage\n\nBut the dramatic tax cutting doesn\u2019t appear to have done nearly as much for job growth as promised.\n\nThe Milwaukee Journal Sentinel says that Wisconsin ranked 35th of the 50 states in job growth during the first three years of Scott Walker\u2019s term, and dead last among its immediate neighbors, including, Minnesota, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan and Ohio.\n\nKansas hasn\u2019t fared much better. According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, the state\u2019s rate of job growth has lagged the national average since Brownback\u2019s tax cuts took effect.\n\nNorth Carolina, at least, matched the national average in job creation in 2013. But the total number of jobs added to the state\u2019s economy in the second half of the year \u2013 when the tax cuts went into effect, was actually smaller than the total number added in 2012.\n\nRelated: Strong June Jobs Report Masks Woes of Long-Term Unemployed\n\nIn fact, there\u2019s not a lot of academic consensus about the real impact of tax rates on job creation. While the prima facie case that lower taxes boosts job creation seems strong, there are secondary effects from cutting taxes that may reduce a state\u2019s attractiveness to businesses.\n\nKansas, for example, has cut funding for education and infrastructure \u2013 both potential negative factors for businesses looking for a high-skilled workforce and reliable public services.\n\n\u201cOrganizations advocating lower and less progressive taxes can find some studies by reputable economists that find that above-average state and local taxes have a measurable and consistently adverse impact on state economic performance,\u201d writes CBPP\u2019s Michael Mazerov. \u201cHowever, many equally reputable studies reach the opposite conclusion, and the results of many more are mixed, ambivalent, or show that any adverse impacts are small. There is simply no consensus whatsoever that cutting taxes is a good strategy to boost state economic growth and create jobs.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "It seems like a no-brainer: reduce taxes and, all things equal, businesses looking to expand or relocate will find your state more attractive than its neighbors.
