“We have been very specific. We have more to do, and we will be doing that in the very near future,” the Democratic presidential candidate said of his tax plan on CNN’s “State of the Union.”

When pressed about whether the full plan will be available to voters in Iowa before they cast ballots, Sanders responded: “Yep.”

Pundits have questioned how Sanders proposes to pay for his spending platform, which The Wall Street Journal estimates will cost $15 trillion over 10 years.

“The bottom line, what The Wall Street Journal forgot to tell the American people in that article is people will not have to pay for private health insurance and the cost of prescription drugs is going down,” Sanders said.

The senator said he plans to expand Social Security by removing the cap that prevents taxes from being levied against income over $250,000.

He also said he would go after corporations that try to stash money overseas in order to avoid onerous tax burdens.

And the self-proclaimed democratic socialist said his plan to subsidize college and university tuition will be financed through new taxes on Wall Street speculation.

Sanders has maintained that his plan will be fully funded without raising taxes on the middle class.
