Martinez determined that the Colorado Education Association, which filed the lawsuit, failed to prove its claim that a state law changing the way teachers were evaluated and awarded tenure violated teachers\u2019 due-process rights.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed after the legislature\u2019s passage in 2010 of Senate Bill 191, which amended the Teacher Employment, Compensation and Dismissal Act.\n\nPlaintiff Cynthia Masters, representing the CEA, opposed a provision of the bill that allowed districts to dismiss nonprobationary teachers when they are no longer needed because of a drop in enrollment or closing a school or program.\n\nBefore the law was passed, districts were required to find a new position for nonprobationary teachers when they were displaced.\n\nSB 191 mandated provisions in teachers contracts that required the consent of the hiring principal before a teacher could be transferred to a school.\n\nThe teacher could be placed on unpaid leave if they were not hired by a principal within a year. Plaintiffs claimed the law violated the Colorado Constitution\u2019s contract and due-process laws.\n\nMartinez wrote in his decision that courts have found that laws are not intended to create contractual or vested rights.\n\nThe judge also noted that legislatures have the right to modify or change property rights.\n\nKirk Mitchell: 303-954-1206, kmitchell@denverpost.com or twitter.com/kirkmitchell", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Denver judge dismisses tenure lawsuit by teachers against DPS", "title": "Denver judge dismisses tenure lawsuit by teachers against DPS", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/06/06/denver-judge-dismisses-tenure-lawsuit-by-teachers-against-dps/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-06T22:18:06+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-06T22:18:06+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf5c1\"", "article_summary": "A Denver district judge Friday dismissed a lawsuit by teachers that challenged Denver Public Schools\u2019 tenure policies, according to court records.\nDenver District Judge Michael A.
