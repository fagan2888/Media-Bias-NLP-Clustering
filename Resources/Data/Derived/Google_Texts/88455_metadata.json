It lists some of the hottest and coldest places on Earth. GB Energy put together this image.\n\nNOTE: This image is best viewed on a desktop or laptop web browser. Not on mobile devices. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.\n\nDeath Valley here in the United States holds the record for the hottest air temperature every recorded. For many years there was a debate on this hot location. Some believed a location in Libya held the record, while others claimed it was Death Valley. After an investigation of records, it was determined Death Valley was the winner.\n\nThe Grand Canyon is on the list for reaching 120\u00b0 on three separate locations at Phantom Ranch, which is at the bottom of the canyon. The hottest temperature ever recorded in Arizona is 128\u00b0.\n\nOne of the most interesting hot places on the list is the Cave of the Crystals in Mexico, about a four hour drive straight south of El Paso. Click here to see photos taken inside this cave published in a National Geographic article. Note in the picture how small the people in the orange jumpsuits are compared to the massive crystals. It looks surreal but it certainly is a reality.\n\nThe United States is also on the list for some of the coldest spots on Earth. Mount McKinley in Alaska is the coldest mountain on Earth. While Mount Everest is the highest, that peak is close to the equator. Mount McKinley is near the Arctic Circle. Not too far away is Barrow, Alaska, which is also on the list and inside the Arctic Circle. Barrow spends about 90% of each year below freezing.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "Of course Arizona made the list for one of the hottest places, but one of the most interesting places is not too far away in Northern Mexico; in a cave with crystals as big as massive tree trunks.", "author": "Erin Jordan", "og": {"url": "http://www.tucsonnewsnow.com/story/29148209/hottest-and-coldest-places-on-earth-arizona-made-the-list", "image": "http://kold.images.worldnow.com/images/7873262_G.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Of course Arizona made the list for one of the hottest places, but one of the most interesting places is not too far away in Northern Mexico; in a cave with crystals as big as massive tree trunks.", "title": "Hottest and coldest places on Earth: Arizona made the list"}, "twitter": {"account_id": 17641427, "creator": "@TucsonNewsNow", "image": "http://kold.images.worldnow.com/images/7873262_G.jpg", "title": "Hottest and coldest places on Earth: Arizona made the list", "site": "@TucsonNewsNow", "card": "summary", "description": "Of course Arizona made the list for one of the hottest places, but one of the most interesting places is not too far away in Northern Mexico; in a cave with crystals as big as massive tree trunks."}, "wnreadableurl": "hottest-and-coldest-places-on-earth-arizona-made-the-list", "ROBOTS": "Index,Follow,NoArchive", "date": "2015/05/25", "fb": {"admins": 644426401, "app_id": 215936215202939}, "google-site-verification": "wum6pK5VyCXxNIhQSMSz7se_UVLjlDGJFKTm4EWnWUY", "owner": "KOLD", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/TucsonNewsNow"}, "KEYWORDS": "Tucson News Now,KOLD News 13,FOX 11,KOLD,KMSB,Tucson,Southern Arizona,Arizona", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS03", "news_keywords": "Tucson News Now,KOLD News 13,FOX 11,KOLD,KMSB,Tucson,Southern Arizona,Arizona"}, "article_summary": "The United States is also on the list for some of the coldest spots on Earth.\nIt lists some of the hottest and coldest places on Earth.\nThe hottest temperature ever recorded in Arizona is 128\u00b0.\nDeath Valley here in the United States holds the record for the hottest air temperature every recorded.\nMount McKinley in Alaska is the coldest mountain on Earth."}
