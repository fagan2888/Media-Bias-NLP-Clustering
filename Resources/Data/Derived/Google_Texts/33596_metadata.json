Holder said Palin \u201cwasn\u2019t a particularly good vice presidential candidate\u201d and is \u201can even worse judge of who ought to be impeached and why.\u201d\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nHe did not allege Palin or Boehner of opposing Obama because of his race, but he suggested \u201cthere\u2019s a certain racial component to this for some people\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a certain level of vehemence, it seems to me, that\u2019s directed at me [and] directed at the president,\u201d Holder said, according to a transcript. \u201cYou know, people talking about taking their country back. \u2026 There\u2019s a certain racial component to this for some people. I don\u2019t think this is the thing that is a main driver, but for some there\u2019s a racial animus.\u201d\n\nPalin announced in an op-ed last week on Breitbart.com that Obama\u2019s \u201cmany impeachable offenses\u201d can no longer be ignored.\n\nPalin specifically said Obama\u2019s lawlessness on illegal immigration was the tipping point because it impacted Americans \u2014 native-born and legal immigrants \u2014 of all backgrounds:\n\n\n\nThe federal government is trillions of dollars in debt; many cities are on the verge of insolvency; our overrun healthcare system, police forces, social services, schools, and our unsustainably generous welfare-state programs are stretched to the max. We average Americans know that. So why has this issue been allowed to be turned upside down with our \u201cleader\u201d creating such unsafe conditions while at the same time obstructing any economic recovery by creating more dependents than he allows producers? His friendly wealthy bipartisan elite, who want cheap foreign labor and can afford for themselves the best \u201cborder security\u201d money can buy in their own exclusive communities, do not care that Obama tapped us out. Have faith that average American workers \u2013 native-born and wonderful legal immigrants of all races, backgrounds, and political parties \u2013 do care because we\u2019re the ones getting screwed as we\u2019re forced to follow all our government\u2019s rules while others are not required to do so. Many now feel like strangers in their own land. It\u2019s the American worker who is forced to deal with Obama\u2019s latest crisis with our hard-earned tax dollars while middle class wages decrease, sustainable jobs get more scarce, and communities become unrecognizable and bankrupted due to Obama\u2019s flood of illegal immigration. Who\u2019s looking out for the American workers? Who has their backs? Who fights for them? We should.\n\nPalin was talking about black Americans like Elaine, who called into the Laura Ingraham Show on Friday from gang-besieged Baltimore, Maryland.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m living a nightmare. My whole neighborhood is so violent. There\u2019s so much crime,\u201d Elaine said. \u201cI have gangs everywhere here in Baltimore! I can\u2019t let my daughter ride her bicycle outside \u2013 I can\u2019t do anything, Laura! I\u2019m trapped here.\u201d Elaine noted that Democrats like Obama talk about spending billions on illegal immigrants, but \u201cnobody is saying a word\u201d about poor Americans.\n\n\u201cWell, what about my neighborhood? You don\u2019t have to do it in Beverly Hills, but in the inner cities where we are suffering,\u201d Elaine continued. \u201cMy children cannot play outside. I cannot take my trash out without locking the door \u2013 it\u2019s awful. Who is going to give us anything? Where can I get asylum? Where can I get refugee status? I don\u2019t know what I can do. Nobody cares what happens to my children.\u201d\n\nHolder has also been accused of enabling the Obama administration\u2019s lawlessness, particularly on the IRS\u2019s blatant targeting of conservatives. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) has said Holder should be impeached if he takes no action on the targeting scandal.\n\nHolder also doubled on his 2009 remarks in which he said America was a \u201cnation of cowards\u201d when it comes to discussing race.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t walk away from that speech,\u201d Holder said. \u201cI think we are still a nation that is too afraid to confront racial issues.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "On Sunday, Attorney General Eric Holder said some Republicans who oppose President Barack Obama are motivated by", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "On Sunday, Attorney General Eric Holder said some Republicans who oppose President Barack Obama are motivated by", "title": "Eric Holder: Some Republicans Oppose Obama Due to 'Racial Animus' - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Government/2013/DOJ/Holdre_confused_Reuters.jpg", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2014/07/13/eric-holder-some-republicans-oppose-obama-due-to-racial-animus/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "On Sunday, Attorney General Eric Holder said some Republicans who oppose President Barack Obama are motivated by", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Government/2013/DOJ/Holdre_confused_Reuters.jpg", "title": "Eric Holder: Some Republicans Oppose Obama Due to 'Racial Animus' - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Eric Holder, Sarah Palin, Ted Cruz,Big Government,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "Ted Cruz", "published_time": "2014-07-13T09:20:00-07:00", "categories": "Big Government"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda60b\"", "article_summary": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTEROn Sunday, Attorney General Eric Holder said some Republicans who oppose President Barack Obama are motivated by \u201cracial animus.\u201dOn ABC\u2019s This Week, Holder also dismissed former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin\u2019s call for President Barack Obama\u2019s impeachment over Obama\u2019s lawlessness on illegal immigration and House Speaker John Boehner\u2019s (R-OH) lawsuit against Obama over his Obamacare lawlessness.\nSen.
