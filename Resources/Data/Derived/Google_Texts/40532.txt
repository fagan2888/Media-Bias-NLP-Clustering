The plight of Ruth Mae Sanders, 93 years-old and suffering from Alzheimer’s, has taken another turn with support from local lawyers. Representatives for Mrs. Sanders and her daughter, Leena Sanders beat the midnight deadline on Friday and filed a request to the Texas Supreme Court for more time to pursue an appeal in her battle against realty brokerage firm Henry S. Miller.

Yesterday we spotlighted the battle between Mrs. Sanders who does not dispute signing a contract in 2012. However, her daughter and medical professionals have countered that she was already exhibiting signs of Alzheimer’s and therefore not qualified to enter into a legal agreement.

The sale fell through when the investor backed out, dropping plans to build a 7-11 where her home is located. However, Henry S. Miller says she owes their commission anyway. It has grown from $53,700 to $125,000 with legal fees and judgements added on.

Leena Sanders feels encouraged by the response following the Dallas Morning News earlier story this week. She told the paper,“To know there are people willing to advocate on my mother’s behalf and work with us toward a resolution is heartening, to say the least.”
