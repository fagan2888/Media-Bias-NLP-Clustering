Bush to plagiarizing George W. Bush.\"\n\nRepublicans might not have heard much to cheer about in President Barack Obama\u2019s State of the Union address, but a former GOP speechwriter almost felt flattered.\n\nMarc Thiessen was the lead writer for President George W. Bush\u2019s 2007 State of the Union speech, and he said he found the similarities between the two speeches a bit eerie.\n\n\"There were lines like, \u2018Our job is to help Americans build a future of hope and opportunity,\" Thiessen told Fox News\u2019 Megyn Kelly. \"\u2018A future of hope and opportunity requires that all citizens have affordable and available health care, extending opportunity and hope depends on a stable supply of energy.\u2019 All of that came from the 2007 State of the Union from George W. Bush.\n\n\"So Barack Obama has gone from blaming George W. Bush to plagiarizing George W. Bush,\" Thiessen concluded.\n\nPlagiarism -- which is to use the words or ideas of another person as if they were your own words or ideas -- is a fairly serious charge, so we decided to look at the substance behind it.\n\nWe contacted Thiessen, and he said we should look at his statement in context.\n\n\"Did Obama copy Bush word-for-word? No,\" Thiessen told us. \"But Obama clearly lifted the repeating theme of his address from Bush's 2007 State of the Union. In Obama's case, it's significant because he is abandoning a liberal theme that was not working (income inequality) in favor of a conservative theme that does (opportunity).\"\n\nThiessen said this wasn\u2019t the first time he felt Obama borrowed heavily from Bush. He said it happened before in an Obama speech on Syria .\n\nIn this case, Thiessen does well to back away from the zinger he delivered on television. Jonathan Bailey runs a consulting operation and website called Plagiarism Today . Bailey told us Obama\u2019s speech didn\u2019t have what Bailey would call plagiarism.\n\n\"It doesn\u2019t appear that any lines were lifted verbatim, or even very close to verbatim,\" Bailey said.\n\nFirst, Obama never said, \"Our job is to help Americans build a future of hope and opportunity,\" or, \"A future of hope and opportunity requires that all citizens have affordable and available health care, extending opportunity and hope depends on a stable supply of energy.\"\n\nSo Thiessen is wrong on that point.\n\nEven in more isolated contexts, an accusation of plagiarism appears unjustified.\n\nOn Fox News, Thiessen mentioned the phrases \"hope and opportunity\" or \"opportunity and hope.\" In 2007, Bush used those phrases seven times. Obama never used either of them.\n\nIn fact, Obama -- who ran his 2008 campaign on a slogan of \"hope\" -- didn\u2019t use that word at all.\n\nBush talked about affordable health care twice. Obama never used that term except when he referred to the Affordable Care Act. (Not that the mention of affordable health care should be considered plagiarism.)\n\nBush spoke of \"energy\" three times; Obama eight.\n\nBoth presidents also used the word opportunity -- Obama 12 times, Bush nine. The idea of opportunity belongs to both political parties, but it\u2019s a word more typically used by Republicans, both Thiessen and Bailey said.\n\n\"Much of the language in Obama\u2019s speech took a more conservative tone, using words and terminology commonly associated with Republicans,\" Bailey said.\n\nThat said, not everyone agrees that Obama took much of a conservative turn in his speech. According to an analysis from political scientists Benjamin Lauderdale at the London School of Economics and John Sides at George Washington University, Obama\u2019s tone was not much different than it had been in previous years.\n\nFor fun, we used the website Wordle to generate diagrams showing how many times the two presidents used certain words in their speeches. The similarities and differences are fairly obvious. In 2007, war and terrorism were more pressing than work and jobs are in 2014. In the scheme of things, both presidents invoked \"opportunity\" about the same number of times.\n\nMost common words in President George W. Bush\u2019s 2007 State of the Union address\n\nMost common words in President Barack Obama\u2019s 2014 State of the Union address\n\nOur ruling\n\nThiessen said that Obama had gone from blaming George W. Bush to plagiarizing him. Thiessen himself says he didn\u2019t mean that Obama copied Bush; rather, that Obama took the theme of opportunity from Bush.\n\nEven if Obama did emphasize a theme Republicans identify with, that in no way matches the popular, or legal, understanding of plagiarism. At PunditFact, we understand that words can be delivered for effect, but we also uphold the principle that words matter.\n\nWe rate this claim False.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Republicans might not have heard much to cheer about in President Barack Obama&rsquo;s State of the Union address, but a former GOP speechwriter almost felt flattered.
