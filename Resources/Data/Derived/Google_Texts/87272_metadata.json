The trade group wants the agency to allow wineries to provide restaurants with calorie ranges based on serving size and alcohol content, rather than exact calorie counts for specific wines.\n\nAccording to the trade group, testing to determine exact calorie counts would cost around $500 per variety of wine\u2014a hardship for winemakers, especially small ones, if it were required for each Chardonnay or Pinot Noir on the menu.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a small winery making 10 wines, it\u2019s just another step to take before taking products to market,\u201d Michael Kaiser, WineAmerica\u2019s director of public affairs, told the Washington Post. \u201cIt\u2019s cost and time.\u201d\n\nThe new calorie rule, which was included in the Affordable Care Act, has received mixed reviews. The National Restaurant Association backed the rule, saying it preferred a uniform national requirement to a variety of state rules, but grocery stores, gas stations, and other retailers that sell freshly prepared food along with other products opposed it.\n\nThe rule went into effect last month, but businesses have until December 1, 2015, to comply.\n\nShare this article", "article_metadata": {"description": "The trade group WineAmerica announced that it will work to ensure that the FDA won't require wineries to test each type of wine they produce.", "pocket-site-verification": "f7059b70f081a1e1ced322fc1d9787", "og": {"site_name": "Associations Now", "description": "The trade group WineAmerica announced that it will work to ensure that the FDA won't require wineries to test each type of wine they produce.", "title": "WineAmerica Makes Lobbying Push on FDA Calorie Rule", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://associationsnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/0113_wine.jpg", "url": "http://associationsnow.com/2015/01/wine-industry-makes-lobbying-push-fda-calorie-rule/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Associations Now", "description": "The trade group WineAmerica announced that it will work to ensure that the FDA won't require wineries to test each type of wine they produce.", "creator": "@associationsnow", "image": "http://associationsnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/0113_wine.jpg", "title": "WineAmerica Makes Lobbying Push on FDA Calorie Rule", "site": "@associationsnow", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"admins": 502961619}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/AssociationsNow", "section": "Uncategorized", "published_time": "2015-01-13T16:50:19+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Money & Business, WineAmerica"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd04d5\"", "article_summary": "Wine Industry Makes Lobbying Push on FDA Calorie Rule AND What's this?\n\u201cIt\u2019s cost and time.\u201dThe new calorie rule, which was included in the Affordable Care Act, has received mixed reviews.\nThe trade group wants the agency to allow wineries to provide restaurants with calorie ranges based on serving size and alcohol content, rather than exact calorie counts for specific wines.\nBy Ernie Smith / Jan 13, 2015 (iStock/Thinkstock) (iStock/Thinkstock)The trade group WineAmerica is urging the FDA not to require wineries to test each type of wine they produce, a practice the organization says could be extremely costly.\nThe rule went into effect last month, but businesses have until December 1, 2015, to comply."}
