UnitedHealth wants to buy Aetna Inc., while Aetna is said to be weighing its options for purchasing Humana Inc.\n\nThe insurers' takeover tango follows the hospital industry's own merger mania, which has been on the uptick in recent years. Buying smaller rivals affords health insurers more market share and leverage during rate negotiations with hospitals, the Journal reports.\n\nWhat this means for you\n\nWhile health insurers are finding creative ways to boost profits, they still have legal responsibilities to the states in which they operate, to the federal government and, of course, to consumers.\n\nFor example, Obamacare provisions protect consumers from dramatic increases in their annual health insurance premiums. Insurers who intend to mark up their rates by 10 percent or more must explain and submit their proposals to the federal or state government for review.\n\nAdditionally, insurance companies have to abide by the \"80/20 rule,\" which requires them to spend at least 80 cents of every premium dollar on patient care. If they fail to meet that target, they must refund the difference to policyholders.\n\nSeveral insurers are requesting double-digit percentage increases in their health insurance premiums for 2016. Find out how this may affect your wallet.\n\nFollow me on Twitter @CrissiPonder.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "news, health insurance, health care, obamacare, affordable care act, mergers and acquisitions", "description": "The two largest health insurers are looking to merge with smaller companies.
