A proposed change to the way agents and brokers are compensated will \u201cdefinitely decrease commission,\u201d says Jason Perry, national sales and marketing director with Medicare Advantage Specialists.The rule change was presented last month by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Instead of being paid for selling a policy to a first-time buyer for the entire 12 months\u2014beginning on the date of the sale and ending the following year\u2014the compensation schedule will be pro-rated to run to the end of the year.For example, a producer who sells a first-time Medicare Advantage plan in July will now be pro-rated for six months of coverage\u2014with the policy ending in December\u2014as opposed to receiving a full commission for a July 2014 to July 2015 policy.Additionally, instead of receiving 50% of the initial year compensation upon renewal, agents and brokers would now receive 35% in commission for a renewed policy.CMS claims the rule change would \u201csimplify the administration of these payments and reduce incentives for agents and brokers to encourage beneficiaries to enroll in plans without regard to ensuring plan benefits would meet the beneficiaries\u2019 health care needs.\u201dFor Perry, however, it simply means significantly decreased compensation for agents and brokers who are already struggling.\u201cMedicare Advantage can\u2019t necessarily be a staple for anyone anymore,\u201d Perry said in a conversation with Insurance Business. \u201c[The rule change] will definitely decrease our commission.\u201dPerry likened the proposed compensation changes to the advent of the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act (MIPPA) in 2008, which restructured the industry and saw numerous producers exit the market. He expects the same thing to happen if the rule change is approved.\u201cDo we think it\u2019s going to be a loss in the agent base across the country because of the reduction? Sure,\u201d he said. \u201cWe think that it will happen again, but we just have to plan accordingly.\u201dPart of that planning involves diversifying product offerings\u2014something Medicare Advantage Specialists has done, and something Perry believes all producers will have to do in order to stay relevant as the market structure continues to change.\u201cThe whole industry is diversifying right now,\u201d he said. \u201cBig government is getting involved and trying to regulate again. There are some good things and some bad things in the industry; this is just affecting a part of the good side.\u201dThe proposed rule change is currently in a public comment period until 5 p.m. on March 7. Agents and brokers wishing to comment on the rule can do so on the Federal Register.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.ibamag.com/news/programs/cms-rule-change-will-definitely-decrease-commission-17403.aspx", "image": {"width": 200, "identifier": "http://www.ibamag.com/files/image/Insurance%20Business/coins%20counting%20money%20stack%20finger%20suit%20man.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 200}, "site_name": "Insurance Business", "description": "Changes to agent and broker compensation for these policy sales further complicates an embattled program.", "title": "CMS rule change will \u201cdefinitely decrease commission\u201d"}, "twitter": {"description": "Changes to agent and broker compensation for these policy sales further complicates an embattled program.", "title": "CMS rule change will \u201cdefinitely decrease commission\u201d", "url": "http://www.ibamag.com/news/programs/cms-rule-change-will-definitely-decrease-commission-17403.aspx", "image": "http://www.ibamag.com/files/image/Insurance%20Business/coins%20counting%20money%20stack%20finger%20suit%20man.jpg", "site": "@InsuranceBizUS", "card": "summary"}, "description": "Changes to agent and broker compensation for these policy sales further complicates an embattled program.", "author": "Caitlin Bronson"}, "article_summary": "A proposed change to the way agents and brokers are compensated will \u201cdefinitely decrease commission,\u201d says Jason Perry, national sales and marketing director with Medicare Advantage Specialists.The rule change was presented last month by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\nHe expects the same thing to happen if the rule change is approved.\u201cDo we think it\u2019s going to be a loss in the agent base across the country because of the reduction?\nThere are some good things and some bad things in the industry; this is just affecting a part of the good side.\u201dThe proposed rule change is currently in a public comment period until 5 p.m. on March 7.\n\u201c[The rule change] will definitely decrease our commission.\u201dPerry likened the proposed compensation changes to the advent of the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act (MIPPA) in 2008, which restructured the industry and saw numerous producers exit the market.\nAgents and brokers wishing to comment on the rule can do so on the Federal Register."}
