While the air mass will moderate and we\u2019re not expecting the -50 to -60 degree wind chills, we can still expect air temperatures to crash into the single digits and wind chills of -5 to -15 degrees by Tuesday morning.\n\nPreparing Yourself for the Cold\n\nWith the most dangerous wind chills expected Monday night and Tuesday morning, here are some tips for dealing with the cold:\n\nEducate yourself: The best way to protect yourself from the cold is to understand it. The wind chill, or \u201cfeels like\u201d temperature, is calculated taking into account the air temperature and wind speed. An air temperature in the single digits with sustained windspeed of 15 mph can mean it can feel like -20 degrees to you. Frostbite can occur to any exposed skin in less than 30 minutes with wind chills in the -20 degree range.\n\nKnow the signs: Hypothermia: Hypothermia occurs when the internal body temperature drops below 95 degrees. According to the CDC, signs of hypothermia include shivering, drowsiness, confusion, slurred speech, and memory loss. While infants and the elderly are most prone to hypothermia, everyone is at risk. Frostbite: Frostbite is literally frozen skin. The early signs of frostbite include redness of the skin and pain. Advanced signs include a whitening/greying or yellowing of the skin, skin that feels very firm or waxy, and numbness.\n\nHave a plan and an emergency cold kit: The best defense is a good offense. Have an emergency kit ready with any necessary supplies specific to handling cold temperatures including: extra batteries (batteries drain faster in the cold), extra blankets and/or sleeping bags, a fire extinguisher, carbon monoxide detector, etc. See this full checklist of the do\u2019s and don\u2019ts for riding out the cold, from the CDC.\n\nThe best defense is a good offense.

Despite having fur, they can be affected by the cold just as quickly as we can. Here are some great tips from the ASPCA:\n\nDO NOT leave them outside. Even if they are normally outdoor pets, bring them inside. They will freeze to death in this cold. If you see an animal stuck outside, call the authorities immediately.\n\nWhen walking your dog, keep them on a leash to prevent the dog from running away or getting lost. Scents are lost in the cold (and especially with snow on the ground) so dogs can easily lose their way.\n\nKeep pet beds off the floor or away from doors and windows where cold air can settle or cold drafts can exist. Provide a warm blanket or pillow to keep them warm.\n\nThis should go without saying, but do not leave your pet in a vehicle during the extreme cold. Cold air can get trapped in a car like a freezer.\n\nKnow the signs of hypothermia and frostbite: Hypothermia : Dogs and cats shiver just like we do, and they may appear very lethargic or not seem interested in food. Frostbite : Ears and paws are most prone to frostbite. The tips of the ears may become red or hard indicating early signs of frostbite. Paws will also become increasingly red, and they may lick them indicating numbness, pain, or sensitivity.\n\nA good rule of thumb: If it\u2019s too cold for you, it\u2019s too cold for your pet.\n\nRelated: The Best and Worst Airports for Winter Travel\n\nPreparing Your Home for the Cold\n\nYour home is where you will most likely be riding out the cold temperatures, so here are some tips to make sure your house is prepped to handle the cold:\n\nTo prevent pipes from freezing, keep cabinet doors open and allow faucets to drip.\n\nDrain or disconnect any outdoor faucets or hoses to prevent freezing.\n\nKeep generators outside and at least 20 feet way from your home to prevent carbon monoxide poisoning.\n\nInstall carbon monoxide detectors on every floor of your home.\n\nKeep your thermostat at a steady temperature and no colder than 55 degrees.\n\nWhile it may be tempting, avoid using candles to prevent a house fire.\n\nCovering windows with plastic on the inside can help insulate your home and prevent cold drafts.\n\nMake sure your chimney is clean before burning wood.\n\nKeep portable heaters at least 3 feet away from bedding, curtains, drapes, etc. to prevent fires.\n\nDo not use portable gas camp stoves or charcoal grills inside due to deadly fumes.\n\nFill a bathtub with water in the event water mains break.\n\nThaw any frozen pipes with a hair dryer, NOT a torch or flame source.\n\nPro tip: With the deep freeze coming, now is the time to protect against frozen pipes.\n\nPreparing Your Vehicle for the Cold\n\nPreparing your car for the cold is also extremely important in the extreme cold. This includes preparations to prevent your car from breaking down on the road, to having an emergency kit in the event you are stranded.\n\nKeep your car in the garage if applicable.\n\nMake sure you have a full tank of gas to avoid freezing or ice on the fuel lines.\n\nCheck antifreeze and windshield wiper fluid levels.\n\nClean battery terminals to reduce the risk of a dead car battery.\n\nMust-have items in a car emergency kit include: Extra warm clothes (gloves, hats, socks), blankets and/or sleeping bags Emergency flares Extra batteries Bottled water and snacks Booster cables, tow chain, or rope Flourescent distress flag An airhorn or siren\n\n\n\nPro tip: Mittens will keep your hands warmer for longer than gloves due to direct skin contact between all five fingers.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe National Weather Service Twin Cities office is calling this cold outbreak a \u201cParticularly Dangerous Situation,\u201d verbiage almost exclusively reserved for severe weather outbreaks such as tornado outbreaks. Nearly three-quarters of the country will fall under the grip of this historic cold, what many National Weather Service offices are saying is the coldest air many have felt in 20-30 years.
