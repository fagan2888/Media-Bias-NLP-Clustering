More bad news on the injury front tonight: Matt Duchene now is hurt. The Avs uber-center has what the team called an oblique injury, suffered in the third period.

The usual is all I can report right now: we’ll know more tomorrow. I don’t want to sound the alarm bell too much, because I don’t know the extent of anything as I type. All I know is oblique injuries are not good for hockey players. They can linger on and on, and need full recovery because those are the muscles most used – are close to it if they aren’t – in skating strides.

Duchene’s game is all about speed, so any injury like that is not good.

This game definitely is one of those “Other than that Mrs. Lincoln, how did you enjoy the play?” nights.
