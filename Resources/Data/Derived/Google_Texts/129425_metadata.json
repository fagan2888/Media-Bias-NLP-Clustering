But I guess my overall point and it goes to your question is we are on the cusp of another great economic era. What\u2019s happening with oil and gas in our country is unprecedented, or at least not since 40 or 50 years ago, have we had the capacity to be a major exporter of both oil and gas with all the advantages that will give us, what\u2019s happening or could happen with clean energy, we\u2019ll put people to work, we\u2019ll provide all kinds of new economic activity, if we got serious about infrastructure, again we could help employ more people, we have the kind of economic advancements that go along with improved infrastructure, on and on, so I just think we have to get out of the ideological wars that either we can\u2019t change anything or we have to change everything, and begin to be smart and pragmatic problem solvers again, and I think that goes to your point. I don\u2019t know what the right answer about the tax is.\n\nAnd that was only part of her answer. She once more is saying nothing and using many words to say it, as if she is pulling buzz words and talking points from the recesses of her memory. Maybe she figures that if she talks long enough and sounds serious the audience won\u2019t know she is not answering the question. Does she not have an opinion? Or does she not want to tell us?\n\nHillary Rodham Clinton signs copies of her book Hard Choices at Books and Books on October 2, 2014 in Coral Gables, Florida.(Photo by Jeff Daly/Invision/AP)\n\nThis gets back to the problem we have discussed before: For someone so revered by liberal elites, Clinton has precious little of substance to say. Had she faced a real interviewer the appropriate follow ups (after, \u201cWhat?!?!\u201c) would have been:\n\nDon\u2019t you have an opinion on a key issue that has come up for vote multiple times in Congress and concerns the president\u2019s signature achievement? If we are on the \u201ccusp of another great economic era\u201d why would we want to tax a high-tech industry that innovates and creates high-paying jobs? Was it a mistake to include it in Obamacare? If so, are there other parts of the law that should be changed? I\u2019m not sure what oil and gas have to do with this but since you bring it up why are we not developing energy resources on government lands? Why have we not yet approved the XL Keystone pipeline and why, since you were involved in dozens of issues, have you decided you will refuse to answer questions only on Keystone? And now that you mention \u201cclean energy\u201d will you end the sort of cronyism we saw with Solyndra? Where is there evidence all the \u201cinvestment\u201d has created sustainable industries that can survive without continued government subsidies? Speaking of ideological wars in the 2008 campaign the president said, \u201cIf you want a new kind of politics it\u2019s time to turn the page.\u201d Was he right? Is the person who decried the \u201cvast right-wing conspiracy\u201d the right person to end those wars or will you reignite them?\n\nHillary, however, rarely gets even one tough question let alone a string of them. Perhaps all those years at the State Department left Hillary habituated to talking gibberish. Whatever the reason for her total lack of substance and dearth of actual ideas her eventual GOP opponent will need to be sharp enough to catch her filibustering and persistent enough to expose her fluff.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The inevitable Democratic nominee can't answer a simple question", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The inevitable Democratic nominee can't answer a simple question", "title": "Hillary Clinton spews gibberish, again", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2014/10/09/hillary-clinton-spews-gibberish-again/", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/WashingtonPost/Content/Blogs/the-fix/Images/10-02-14_Hillary_Clinton_0017.jpg-08c03.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@JRubinBlogger"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2014/10/09/hillary-clinton-spews-gibberish-again/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "hillary clinton gibberish, hillary clinton not answer, hillary clinton say nothing", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "hillary clinton gibberish, hillary clinton not answer, hillary clinton say nothing"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb303\"", "article_summary": "Hillary Rodham Clinton signs copies of her book Hard Choices at Books and Books on October 2, 2014 in Coral Gables, Florida.\nIs the person who decried the \u201cvast right-wing conspiracy\u201d the right person to end those wars or will you reignite them?\nPerhaps all those years at the State Department left Hillary habituated to talking gibberish.\nHillary, however, rarely gets even one tough question let alone a string of them.\nBut I guess my overall point and it goes to your question is we are on the cusp of another great economic era."}
