He returned to the theme later in the interview, this time applying it to U.S. domestic politics:\n\n\u201cOur politics are dysfunctional, and something that I said earlier serves as a warning to us: and that is, societies don\u2019t work when political factions take maximalist positions. And the more diverse the country is, the less it can afford to take maximalist positions.\u201d\n\nThis is sage advice. Too bad he didn't follow it himself.\n\nSo much of the president\u2019s current troubles can be traced back to his comment to Eric Cantor, which the president uttered at a meeting held just three days into his first term. The setting was a White House meeting hosted by the freshly inaugurated president and his top economic advisers. Their guests were congressional leaders of both parties and both chambers of Congress\u2014there to discuss the framework of the huge stimulus bill hurtling through the newly installed 111th Congress.\n\nDespite Obama\u2019s bravado in the meeting, he also expressed openness to the ideas Cantor proposed. As Carl M. Cannon and I reported in our eBook, \u201cElection 2012: The Battle Begins,\u201d Republican lawmakers left the White House feeling Obama was sincere in his desire to work with them on crafting the legislation.\n\nBut it quickly became apparent that this was little more than lip service. Republicans discovered that most of the stimulus bill had already been written behind closed doors by Nancy Pelosi and David Obey, then chairman of the House Appropriations Committee. Obama failed to step in, and almost nothing Republicans suggested to the president was seriously considered by Democrats, let alone incorporated into the legislation.\n\nRepublicans felt used by the president, and disrespected by their colleagues on the other side of the aisle. Not a single GOP House lawmaker voted in favor of the stimulus. Whatever political goodwill that existed in the aftermath of the 2008 election was gone less than a week after Obama\u2019s inauguration. The well was poisoned then and there.\n\nThe president followed up his stimulus package victory by moving full steam ahead on a gargantuan health care bill that was eventually passed a year later\u2014again strictly along party lines\u2014with the help of procedural gimmicks and backroom deals.\n\nIf Obama ever had a chance to \u201cun-poison\u201d the well with the GOP, it vanished when the Affordable Care Act became law in early 2010. But imagine how things could have played out differently if Obama in 2009 had taken the advice from himself on Friday. Imagine if the president had chosen to accommodate his political opponents early on, instead of pressing forward with a maximalist \u201cmy way or the highway\u201d attitude.\n\nAt the time, Republicans were weak, rudderless, and demoralized. Obama\u2019s approval rating in late January 2009 stood over 63 percent and his disapproval rating was only 20 percent. The GOP was reeling from an election in which they were routed pretty much across the board by a popular new president, including a big loss among independents voters. Obama\u2019s not the first president, nor will he be the last, to misread his election as a \u201cmandate.\u201d It would have taken real insight, and no small amount of political courage, for Obama to compromise. His progressive base, still euphoric over his election, would have been livid at the idea of working with Republicans. Instead of extending a hand to their defeated political opponents, liberal activists preferred putting a boot on their throats.\n\nHowever, as Democrats should now see in hindsight, a smarter strategy would have been to encourage Republicans to buy into the stimulus bill right from the start. The package would have had to be smaller, true, but bringing Republican moderates with him could have changed the entire trajectory of Obama\u2019s first term. Not only would they have given him significant political cover, but he would have effectively split the Republican caucus \u2013 thereby weakening it even further. Instead, he instantly unified it.\n\nLiberal critics say that Obama didn\u2019t really have a negotiating partner\u2014the same complaint conservatives make in reverse\u2014and that compromising with Republicans in 2009 and 2010 on the budget and health care wouldn\u2019t have translated into any significant Republican support.\n\nPerhaps that\u2019s true, but we\u2019ll never know because he didn\u2019t try it. It turns out Americans didn\u2019t elect Obama in 2008 because they were desperate for universal health care. They elected him because of his aspirational appeal, which included a promise to be \u201cpost-partisan,\u201d to be pragmatic, and to deliver on his promise to \u201cfix\u201d our broken political system. But the very first decision he made\u2014 in hindsight, perhaps the most consequential of his presidency\u2014only served to bust our political system further. It\u2019s been more or less downhill ever since.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\u201cIf you want just 100 percent and the notion is that the winner really does take all\u2014all the spoils\u2014sooner or later that government is going to break down.\u201d \u2013 President...", "title": "Too Bad Obama Didn't Follow His Own Advice | RealClearPolitics", "og": {"url": "http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2014/08/13/too_bad_obama_didnt_follow_his_own_advice_123650.html", "image": "http://images.rcp.realclearpolitics.com/254289_5_.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "\u201cIf you want just 100 percent and the notion is that the winner really does take all\u2014all the spoils\u2014sooner or later that government is going to break down.\u201d \u2013 President...", "title": "Too Bad Obama Didn't Follow His Own Advice | RealClearPolitics"}, "twitter": {"site": "@rcp_articles", "card": "summary"}, "tweetmeme-title": "Too Bad Obama Didn't Follow His Own Advice | RealClearPolitics", "fb": {"app_id": 1415921935346245}, "keywords": "affordable care act,stimulus,Barack Obama,", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cElections have consequences, and at the end of the day, I won.\u201d \u2013 President Obama to House Republican Whip Eric Cantor, January 23, 2009.\nIf only the current-day President Obama could travel back in time and warn his newly elected self about the dangers of pursuing a governing agenda that excludes and alienates the opposition.\nIt turns out Americans didn\u2019t elect Obama in 2008 because they were desperate for universal health care.\nBut imagine how things could have played out differently if Obama in 2009 had taken the advice from himself on Friday.\nAnd the more diverse the country is, the less it can afford to take maximalist positions.\u201dThis is sage advice."}
