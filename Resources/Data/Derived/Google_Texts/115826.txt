Hillary Clinton’s campaign published an article yesterday titled “7 Ways Hillary Clinton Is Just Like Your Abuela,” using the Spanish word for “grandmother.”

Twitter exploded in outrage, criticizing what users called Clinton’s “Hispandering” and what they see as her hypocrisy vis-à-vis political policies.

The phrase #NotMyAbuela was trending on social media for several hours, as Latinas/os condemned Clinton’s support for Obama’s mass deportation policies, NAFTA, neoliberalism, militarization, and war.
