Police are investigating a shooting sending one man to the hospital Sunday morning.

Sedgwick County dispatchers said they starting receiving calls about shots fired around 3 a.m. Sunday in an area close to 13th and Grove.

A man, 30, was found with gunshot wounds and was rushed to the hospital with serious injuries. Wichita Police Sgt. John Bogle said it appears the victim's injuries are not life-threatening.

Bogle said the victim was heavily sedated and not able to provide them information about what happened. There are little clues as to what happened at a barbeque stand in the area.

"No indications of a disturbance," Bogle said. " A lot of the people that were in the area were patrons of the little BBQ stand and they do not or have provided information that was useful in terms of finding a suspect."

Further details were not immediately available.
