It was the final thud of a decline that had reshaped Congress\u2014and in which I\u2019d played a pivotal role that almost nobody except those FBI agents knew.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nHastert\u2019s speakership had ended in both defeat and scandal. In November 2006, after Democrats retook the house, Hastert announced he'd step down from leadership in the next Congress. He didn\u2019t have much choice in the matter. That fall, a story exploded that likely cost Republicans their House and Senate majority: Florida Republican Rep. Mark Foley, it was revealed, had repeatedly made sexual advances to several congressional pages. Hastert, the speaker at the time, had allegedly been told by House colleagues about Foley\u2019s history of messaging teens, and did nothing.\n\nI was a congressional page in 2001 and 2002. During that year, Foley sent sexual instant messages to at least three of my classmates. The messages weren\u2019t flirtatious\u2014though some started that way\u2014but out and out lewd. Two of those recipients continued to receive them well after their time in the page program had elapsed, extending into our college years. Many of us who were pages at the time knew that the conversations had taken place. Some of us even shared copies of the message logs among ourselves. But how the conversations went public, and who gave them to reporters and started the avalanche that ended Foley\u2019s career and dealt a blow to the Republican congressional majority, has never come out.\n\nIt was me.\n\nI didn\u2019t do it to sink the Republicans, though as an aspiring Democratic politico, I wasn\u2019t sorry to see it happen. I did it because I realized just how easily Rep. Foley had been evading accountability for repeat offenses, and that the House leadership was either unwilling or unable to solve the problem. I had no idea what I\u2019d eventually learn about the speaker in whose hands the problem was placed.\n\nIn 2006, it seemed clear the House leadership knew something inappropriate was happening with Foley and the pages; Hastert\u2019s disgraceful exit from the speakership that year reflected this suspicion-by-consensus. But knowing what I now know, it\u2019s chilling to realize that the speaker of the House had, decades earlier, allegedly sexually abused a teenage boy while working as a high school wrestling coach. What if Hastert\u2019s neglect was not simply incompetence, but choice?\n\n***\n\nFor decades on Capitol Hill, it was impossible to miss the pages. They\u2019re teenagers, fresh-faced, pimple-pocked and famously dressed alike\u2014navy blue blazers, charcoal gray pants, white dress shirts, and a thick blue-and-red-striped polyester tie that conjures images of flight attendants on a discount airline in the Reagan era. To others on the Hill, the uniforms act as a marker for quick identification. Within the program, they functioned as something of an equalizer, a reminder that in spite of our differences\u2014children of wealthy scions and immigrants, red-meat conservatives and fire-breathing liberals\u2014there was a oneness; we belonged.\n\nIn this June 2006 photo, House pages line up to shake hands with Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert in the Capitol Rotunda.

I volunteered long hours with my congressman for years to make it a reality. In August 2001, weeks before my junior year of high school, the acceptance letter came in a thick envelope from House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt. I had been granted admission to my own personal Hogwarts.\n\nRep. Mark Foley, R-Fla., in a July 2003 photo.

We were all living away from home for the first time, housed in a dorm that often took on a summer-camp atmosphere. We were adolescents, subject to the same teenage romances and cliques as all high schoolers, only ours played out in the halls of Congress.\n\nThat first week was a blur\u2014the need to familiarize yourself with the Capitol, to make sense of the House office building system, the Morse code-like bell system and corresponding row of tiny lightbulbs found on every clock on the Hill, the cramped labyrinth of hallways in the basement, the underground tunnel system. We began memorizing the names and faces of every member of the House, using a stack of hundreds of glossy photos as flashcards.\n\nThe second week I remember more clearly: Tuesday, September 11. As our school got out, I made my way to the elevator and noticed a group of pages huddled around the school secretary\u2019s desk. A classmate scurried up to me. \u201cPlanes ran into the World Trade Center,\u201d he said. I thought he was lying.\n\nA dozen of us squeezed into the Democratic cloakroom, huddling around the small, 10-inch TV. As we learned the news\u2014two planes in New York, a plane that hit the Pentagon, one plane still unaccounted for\u2014we also heard the terrifying false alarms: reports of a bomb detonated at the State Department, that the National Mall was on fire. Soon, a decision was made: we have to get out of here.\n\nJust then, a deafening alarm clanged to life in the Capitol building. I assumed the same as everyone else: a plane was about to hit the Capitol. We started sprinting. Police officers made a mad dash for the exits. Outside, there was chaos. Entire congressional offices pouring out into the streets. Smoke plumed from the Pentagon plane crash two miles away.\n\nNew Window OPTICS: A History of the House Page Program | Click here to view a pictorial history of the federal government's youngest officials.\n\nBack at the dorm, penned inside the communal living room until they could get a head count, we gathered and cried. We watched CNN as the footage looped, a Mobius strip of grief, confusion and horror. We were out of Kleenex, so a spare roll of toilet paper passed around, many of us ripping off a few squares in a futile effort to blot our tears and stem the flow.\n\nThat was our introduction to Washington, D.C. We were 16-year-olds, alone and in the middle of it all. Our families were back home, and in their absence, we became a family, with all of the affection, arguments, favoritism, comfort and drama that families entail. Looking back, I realize just how vulnerable we all were.\n\n***\n\nWhen the House was in session, members of Congress interacted constantly with pages. When they needed to get something back to their district office right away, we\u2019d be dispatched to deliver it, post haste. When a VIP called\u2014Senator Kennedy, Senator Clinton, the White House\u2014we would answer the call and leave to find congressman so-and-so in the throng of 400 people on the House floor. When the House was in session, we had to be there, too. If they started early in the morning, we\u2019d end our school day early enough to be on the floor before they arrived. If there was a big vote and they stayed late into the night, we were there until they finished.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO Magazine", "description": "Why I leaked the scandalous Mark Foley messages\u2014and what I regret about it.", "title": "The Page Who Took Down the GOP", "url": "http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/11/the-page-who-took-down-the-gop-mark-foley-dennis-hastert-213378", "image": "http://static.politico.com/69/6f/405849194977a7ee14626ea46cc7/1-lead-zack-54jpg.%20lead-zack-54-c.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politicomag", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politicomag"}, "description": "Why I leaked the scandalous Mark Foley messages\u2014and what I regret about it.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "New Window OPTICS: A History of the House Page Program | Click here to view a pictorial history of the federal government's youngest officials.\nI was a congressional page in 2001 and 2002.\nIn November 2006, after Democrats retook the house, Hastert announced he'd step down from leadership in the next Congress.\nTwo of those recipients continued to receive them well after their time in the page program had elapsed, extending into our college years.\nIn this June 2006 photo, House pages line up to shake hands with Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert in the Capitol Rotunda."}
