Still it was considered the most ambitious effort to enact a long-term highway bill since 2005.\n\nAmong other options, committees in the House and Senate are working on tax reform bills that lawmakers hope might yield additional revenue that could be pumped into patching the nation\u2019s aging infrastructure. Most have ruled out increasing the federal gasoline tax.\n\nWith the latest highway bill about to expire, the House and Senate passed a three-month extension to tide over federal road programs while they negotiate a longer-term bill. It was the 34th short-term extension of highway funding since 2009 as lawmakers have been unable to compromise on anything of longer duration.\n\nSupporters of the six-year bill said it was important to pass a bill that would allow states and contractors the certainty needed to plan major projects. Opponents said the bill was put together using budget gimmicks that will not be sustainable.\n\nSen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., voted for the bill. Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., voted against it.\n\nVote to reauthorize Export-Import Bank\n\nSenators voted 64-29 for a highway bill amendment to reauthorize the Export-Import Bank, setting up a confrontation in the fall with the House where key Republican leaders are not sold on the bank staying in business.\n\nRepublican conservatives and the party\u2019s candidates for president decry the credit agency as an example of \u201ccrony capitalism\u201d for the money it loans to exporters and overseas customers to help finance the sale of U.S. products. But bank supporters say it is a vital tool to maintain U.S. exports and the jobs they support, and to keep pace with foreign sales competitors.\n\nThe charter of the Export-Import Bank expired at the end of June after Congress was unable to resolve the issue. It is prohibited from making new loans although it is allowed to maintain ones it already approved.\n\nAlexander voted to renew the Export-Import Bank. Corker did not vote.\n\nVA workforce bill passes\n\nThe House voted 256-170 to make it easier for the Department of Veterans Affairs to fire corrupt or non-performing workers.\n\nThe \u201cVA Accountability Act\u201d broadened a law enacted last year that gave the VA secretary more authority to fire agency executives. The legislation stems from the 2014 scandal in which it was discovered that patient appointment records were being manipulated at a number of VA health centers to cover up long delays.\n\nThe latest bill speeds the process by which a fired employee must appeal and have the Merit Systems Protection Board issue a ruling. It also limits the time a worker can be on paid administrative leave and extends the probationary period for new employees from a year to 18 months.\n\nAt the same time, sponsors said it would increase whistleblower protections for workers reporting wrongdoing.\n\n\u201cWith the scandals at the VA medical centers and reports of whistleblower retribution, it has become evident that there are more bad apples than we would like to believe,\u201d said Rep. Phil Roe, R-Tenn.\n\nRoe said the bill would give the VA secretary flexibility \u201cto remove these bad actors and send a message about the type of performance that we expect for our veterans.\u201d\n\nOpponents said the bill would strip due process rights from VA employees.\n\nRep. Matt Cartwright, D-Pa., said it would \u201ctransform 300,000 VA personnel to what we call at-will employees, capable of being fired based on anything, including their beliefs and not their merit necessarily. It effectively destroys the civil service as it is and as we know it at the VA.\u201d\n\nReps. Scott DesJarlais and Marsha Blackburn, both R-Tenn., voted for the bill.\n\nHouse passes anti-regulation bill\n\nThe House voted 243-165 to revive a bill giving Congress more power over costly regulations. It was called the REINS Act \u2013 Regulations from the Executive In Need of Scrutiny Act.\n\nThe measure championed by Republicans reflects the view that federal regulations have gotten out of control. It would require that any federal rule having an economic impact of $100 million or more must be approved by Congress.\n\nThe bill has passed the House before but did not advance in the Senate.\n\nPresident Barack Obama has threatened a veto if it ever did.\n\n\u201cWhether it\u2019s IRS rules, Obamacare mandates or EPA regulations, there are no shortage of examples where bad regulation could have been avoided if federal agencies and Congress were held responsible for the harm done to people\u2019s jobs and wages,\u201d said Rep. Todd Young, R-Ind.\n\nAll but two Democrats voted against the bill. They said it would make it all but impossible for the government to propose and carry out necessary health or safety measures.\n\nDesJarlais and Blackburn voted for the bill.", "article_metadata": {"description": "WASHINGTON \u2013 The Senate voted last week for a six-year extension of federal programs for highways, mass transit and infrastructure while acknowledging it needs to come up with more money to pay for the entire bill.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "STEVE TETREAULT Washington Bureau", "og": {"site_name": "Columbia Daily Herald", "description": "WASHINGTON \u2013 The Senate voted last week for a six-year extension of federal programs for highways, mass transit and infrastructure while acknowledging it needs to come up with more money to pay for the entire bill.", "title": "Senate passes a new highway bill", "url": "http://columbiadailyherald.com/news/local-news/senate-passes-new-highway-bill", "image": "http://columbiadailyherald.com/sites/columbiadailyherald.com/files/field/media/web1_highway.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://columbiadailyherald.com/news/local-news/senate-passes-new-highway-bill", "title": "Senate passes a new highway bill", "card": "summary", "creator": "@thedailyherald"}, "al": {"web": {"should_fallback": "true"}, "android": {"url": "columbiadailyherald://?eid=1274620", "app_name": "columbiadailyherald", "package": "com.stephensmedia.columbiadailyherald"}, "ios": {"url": "columbiadailyherald://?eid=1274620", "app_store_id": 964773799, "app_name": "columbiadailyherald"}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=964773799", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.stephensmedia.columbiadailyherald", "keywords": "Local News,Local News,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-02T23:52:01-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=0.9"}, "article_summary": "With the latest highway bill about to expire, the House and Senate passed a three-month extension to tide over federal road programs while they negotiate a longer-term bill.\nStill it was considered the most ambitious effort to enact a long-term highway bill since 2005.\nThe six-year Senate bill would authorize $350 billion in spending, enough only to cover three years.\nHouse passes anti-regulation billThe House voted 243-165 to revive a bill giving Congress more power over costly regulations.\nSenators voted 65-34 for the highway bill, setting the stage for a debate in the fall with the House over infrastructure needs and how to pay for them."}
