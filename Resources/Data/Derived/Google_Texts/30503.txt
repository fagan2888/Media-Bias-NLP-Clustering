Glenn Beck really dislikes Donald Trump to the point where he mused today that the only possible reason any tea partiers could love Trump but hate President Obama is that they’re racist.

Breitbart flagged audio today of Beck saying, as he was discussing Trump’s Dallas rally yesterday, that any Tea Partier who agrees with him that Obama is bad, but also thinks that Trump is good, isn’t being honest about why they dislike the president.

And since the two are so close, Beck surmised, the answer is probably “about Barack Obama being black” or a Democrat.”

Beck made similar comments years ago when he was trashing then-presidential candidate Newt Gingrich, making the same argument about race since he doesn’t see any other big differences between the two.
