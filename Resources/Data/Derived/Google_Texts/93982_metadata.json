Lolita Lopez reports for NBC4 News at 6 p.m. Monday, July 14, 2014. (Published Monday, July 14, 2014)\n\nThis story first appeared July 14, 2014. We are re-posting in the wake of the 6.0 Napa earthquake.\n\nMost Californians are not prepared for a large-scale earthquake, and the state\u2019s Office of Emergency Services knows it.\n\nIn a series of web videos, a trained emergency responder \u201cambushes\u201d residents in Southern California to find out how prepared they are for a large earthquake. The videos are a different take on preparedness education after a recent survey revealed that less than 35 percent of Californians have learned how to make their house secure.\n\nAnd in the case of the Gingery family, featured in one of the videos, the answer is not really.\n\nWith heavy equipment resting unsecured on top of kitchen and living room shelves and cabinets, the Gingery\u2019s assessor called for some changes for the family of four.\n\nThe Gingery family was also placed inside the \u201cBig Shaker,\u201d which replicates a 7.0-magnitude earthquake.\n\n\u201cIf that\u2019s what an earthquake feels like, we\u2019re not ready,\u201d said mother Elaine Gingery.\n\nOnly 40 percent of homes in the state have family disaster plans and fewer than 20 percent of households have structurally reinforced their home or had it inspected for earthquake resistance.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Most Californians are not prepared for a large-scale earthquake, and the state\u2019s Office of Emergency Services knows it.", "title": "Californians Unprepared for Large-Scale Earthquakes", "og": {"site_name": "NBC Southern California", "description": "Most Californians are not prepared for a large-scale earthquake, and the state\u2019s Office of Emergency Services knows it.", "title": "Californians Unprepared for Large-Scale Earthquakes", "url": "http://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/Californians-Unprepared-for-Large-Scale-Earthquakes-267065211.html", "image": "http://media.nbclosangeles.com/images/1203*675/earthquake+preparedness.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Most Californians are not prepared for a large-scale earthquake, and the state\u2019s Office of Emergency Services knows it.", "creator": "@nbcla", "url": "http://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/Californians-Unprepared-for-Large-Scale-Earthquakes-267065211.html", "image": "http://media.nbclosangeles.com/images/1203*675/earthquake+preparedness.jpg?ak=bc", "title": "Californians Unprepared for Large-Scale Earthquakes", "site": "@nbcla", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "taboola_lead": "video", "robots": "noodp,noydir", "tp": {"preferredRuntimes": "Flash,HTML5", "FlashBlacklist": "None|None", "preferredFormats": "mpeg4,m3u,webm,ogg,flv,F4M"}, "fb": {"app_id": 61690781361}, "keywords": "earthquake", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/NBCLA"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "earthquake"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8aa7\"", "article_summary": "Most Californians are not prepared for a large-scale earthquake, and the state\u2019s Office of Emergency Services knows it.\nAnd in the case of the Gingery family, featured in one of the videos, the answer is not really.\nThe Gingery family was also placed inside the \u201cBig Shaker,\u201d which replicates a 7.0-magnitude earthquake.\nThe number of people prepared for \"the big one\" in California is dangerously low, says state legislators, who have turned to reality shows to get the message out on earthquake preparedness.\nThe videos are a different take on preparedness education after a recent survey revealed that less than 35 percent of Californians have learned how to make their house secure."}
