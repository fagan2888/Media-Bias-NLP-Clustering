Marco Rubio, R-Fla., said that veterans should be able to choose between receiving care at a Veterans Affairs facility or from a private provider during a town hall hosted by Concerned Veterans for America in New Hampshire yesterday.\n\nPete Hegseth, the CEO of Concerned Veterans for America, introduced Rubio and praised his efforts towards working to improve the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n\nRubio said that veterans seeking care shouldn\u2019t have to go through a \u201chassle,\u201d and that making care accessible for them at both VA facilities and private providers would expedite their care.\n\nRubio said that his brother, who was born in Cuba, served in the United States Army.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t want my mom to worry, so he told her he was an accountant in the Army,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cUntil my father noticed that accountants don\u2019t jump out of airplanes.\u201d\n\nHis brother\u2019s VA claim is one of the cases handled by Rubio\u2019s office.\n\n\u201cEvery single day in my office, literally we have eight offices across the state of Florida, the number one or number two constituent case work that we have in any given office is a VA claim,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cAnd that calls into question a fundamental tenant of the obligation we owe the men and women who\u2019ve served us in uniform.\u201d\n\nRubio said that the problems at the VA don\u2019t stem from lack of funding.\n\n\u201cThis is not a funding problem,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how much money you pour into a broken model that no longer is responsive to 21st century needs of 21st century veterans.\u201d\n\nRubio said that veterans, and all patients, deserve to make their own choices about their health care.\n\n\u201cBureaucracies do not like competition,\u201d Rubio said.\n\nHe stressed that many at the \u201cground level\u201d in the VA, such as nurses and doctors, are dedicated to serving veterans, but that the VA system is \u201cbroken.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is important for the secretary [of the VA] to be able to fire people who are not doing their job,\u201d Rubio said.\n\nSpeaking more broadly about his foreign policy, Rubio said that we must never send those in uniform into \u201ca fair fight.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat I mean by that is, anytime we ask them to go into combat, anytime we ask them to take on an assignment or an engagement, that they will have an unfair advantage over their adversary,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cThat they will be better trained, they will be better equipped, and that they will know more about the enemy than the enemy knows about them.\u201d\n\nHegseth asked Rubio what he thought of The New York Times\u2019 \u201cgroundbreaking\u201d reporting on the senator\u2019s spending habits.\n\nThe New York Times recently reported that Rubio owns an $80,000 \u201cluxury speedboat.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe best answer I\u2019ve got is someone who emailed me or texted me and said that, \u2018any boat where you have to go to the bathroom off the side of the boat is not a luxury speedboat,'\u201d Rubio joked.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Speaking in New Hampshire, Sen.
