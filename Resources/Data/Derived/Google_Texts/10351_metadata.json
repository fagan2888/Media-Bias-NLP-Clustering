The celebration was kicked off with a flag raising ceremony from Kemper County high JROTC. Captain Charles Moore of the naval air station meridian and representative Greg Snowden were present as guest speakers. Snowden was eager to share a story about a revolutionary war hero.\n\nSnowden says \"Well it's the independence of our country of course. I'm looking forward to sharing the story of Baron Johann de Kalb who was a hero of the American revolution and whom the county seat here in Kemper county is named after.\"\n\nWith conflict and division among Americans today, Snowden wants to remind us that division is nothing new to this country. Even at the signing of the declaration of independence there was division among the colonist as to the right course of action.\n\nHe says \"Benjamin Franklin said one third of Americans were patriots who supported independence, another third supported the king, and the remaining third didn't really care. So American was not united even then. Its our common beliefs that we come together after that in which we became one nation\n\nOn this the day of our independence, Snowden says it is the perfect time to unify once again and become one nation.\n\nSnowden closes with \"That\u2019s what we need to strive to achieve today. We have times that try men\u2019s souls just like that did in the revolution. God bless America\"\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "Kemper County host a morning celebration for the Fourth of July.", "language": "english", "author": "Will Harkins", "og": {"description": "Kemper County host a morning celebration for the Fourth of July.", "title": "Kemper County Celebrates the Fourth of July", "url": "http://www.wtok.com/home/headlines/Kemper-County-Celebrates-the-Fourth-of-July--265843581.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/5CD/DE7/5CDDE73C2DAA4B17BD1CDF2298A11123", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/709/81A/70981A783E4B4FA99176BD312552072E.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.wtok.com", "description": "Kemper County host a morning celebration for the Fourth of July.", "creator": "@newscenter11", "url": "http://www.wtok.com/home/headlines/Kemper-County-Celebrates-the-Fourth-of-July--265843581.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/4TH4.jpg", "title": "Kemper County Celebrates the Fourth of July", "site": "@newscenter11", "card": "summary"}, "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Kemper County Celebrates the Fourth of July", "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "google-site-verification": "M1YwZ85zoJ2ZNboZjzjADGJ9L53qqzbNOi6FLrtDw9U", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Kemper County Celebrates the Fourth"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8477\"", "article_summary": "There was a crowd on the steps of the Kemper County courthouse them morning waiting for the beginning of July 4th celebration.\nThe celebration was kicked off with a flag raising ceremony from Kemper County high JROTC.\nI'm looking forward to sharing the story of Baron Johann de Kalb who was a hero of the American revolution and whom the county seat here in Kemper county is named after.\"\nHe says \"Benjamin Franklin said one third of Americans were patriots who supported independence, another third supported the king, and the remaining third didn't really care.\nWith conflict and division among Americans today, Snowden wants to remind us that division is nothing new to this country."}
