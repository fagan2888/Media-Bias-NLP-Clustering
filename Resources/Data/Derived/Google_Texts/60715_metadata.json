Mark R. Warner (D) declared victory over Ed Gillespie (R) late Tuesday in a remarkably close contest for a second term that is likely to tarnish the Democrat\u2019s image as an untouchable force in Virginia politics.\n\nThe contest was so close that Warner\u2019s opponent declined to concede, but the Democrat promised to serve a second term working across the aisle with a new Republican majority in the Senate.\n\n\u201cIt was a hard-fought race. It went a little longer than we thought,\u201d Warner said. \u201cI\u2019ll work with anyone \u2014 Democrat, Republican, independent, you name it \u2014 if we\u2019re going to make sure we get our country\u2019s problems fixed.\u201d\n\nWith nearly all the precincts reporting early Wednesday, Warner had 49 percent of the vote, just slightly ahead of Gillespie at 48.5 percent.\n\nThe outcome represented a shocking reversal of Warner\u2019s sweeping victory in 2008, which first propelled the former governor into the Senate. A recount is possible, and Gillespie didn\u2019t rule out requesting one in remarks to supporters late Tuesday.\n\n\u201cObviously, we are going to accept whatever is the final outcome,\u201d the Republican said. \u201cBut I owe it to the voters of Virginia, owe it to all of you, to make sure that the outcome is final before we make any final decisions on this end.\u201d\n\nThe race came against a national backdrop that was expected to be bad for Democrats, especially for incumbents with close ties with President Obama and his trouble-plagued health-care law. But Warner had been expected to escape that fate, with polls giving him an increasingly narrow but consistent lead through the final days of the race.\n\nThe moderate image that twice carried Warner to victory perhaps no longer plays well in a state and country that have grown more polarized since his race for governor in 2001. He lost support in rural areas that once solidly backed him while failing to inspire Democrats to turn out in droves.\n\nThis year, the senator saw his support in rural Virginia drop off sharply. He had forged ties to Southside and Southwest even before he ran for governor, earning goodwill in the economically depressed regions as a job-creating entrepreneur. Dave \u201cMudcat\u201d Saunders, a Democratic strategist who helped craft Warner\u2019s rural strategy for his gubernatorial run 13 years ago, attributed that drop to antipathy toward the president, in part racially motivated.\n\n\u201cIt breaks my heart to say it, because these are my people, but racism was a huge factor in this,\u201d he said. \u201cI think in many areas of rural Virginia, racism is still prevalent, and they dislike Obama more than they like Mark Warner.\u201d\n\nRepublicans have said the president\u2019s policies and Warner\u2019s support for them \u2014 especially a perceived \u201cwar on coal\u201d and the Affordable Care Act \u2014 soured voters on both politicians.\n\n\u201cI like Gillespie. I think he\u2019s a smart businessman. If I\u2019m being truthful about it, I also like Warner. I just wish he was a Republican,\u201d said Keith Davis, a retired Hanover County resident who voted for Gillespie. \u201cVote for him and you vote for Obama, and I don\u2019t vote for Obama.\u201d\n\nGillespie\u2019s chief line of attack was that Warner\u2019s moderate image was just that \u2014 one that did not match reality. He said Warner had voted with the president 97 percent of the time, most notably for the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThat message seemed to convince voters that a man who has long billed himself as a business-friendly moderate was now too closely associated with national Democrats.\n\nLate in the campaign, Warner also became tainted by a scandal related to the abrupt resignation of a Democratic state senator. Warner, one of several top Virginia Democrats who tried to dissuade the legislator from quitting the evenly divided state Senate, had discussed the possibility of a federal judgeship or private job for the lawmaker\u2019s daughter.\n\nLittle national money has flowed to Virginia this year, in contrast to the tens of millions spent two years ago when Timothy M. Kaine (D) defeated George Allen (R). Warner attracted nearly twice as much as Gillespie in independent expenditures, and his campaign outspent Gillespie\u2019s by the same margin. Gillespie, a prodigious fundraiser who helped create one of the country\u2019s biggest super PACs, found himself running as the underfunded underdog. \u201cHard work beats big money every time, and we\u2019re going to prove it tomorrow,\u201d Gillespie told supporters at a rally Monday.\n\nAn onslaught of negative ads run by the Warner campaign in recent weeks hinted at concern that Gillespie was gaining ground.\n\nWarner left the governor\u2019s mansion in 2006 with record-high approval ratings, and in the race to succeed retiring Sen. John W. Warner (R) two years later crushed former governor James S. Gilmore III (R). He won with nearly two-thirds of the vote, dominating every region of the state, even rural areas where Republican presidential hopeful John McCain soundly beat Obama.\n\nVictory would return Warner to a job that the Nextel co-founder has often found frustrating because of partisan gridlock. On the campaign trail, he has promised to devote the next two years to a forceful push for bipartisan solutions, saying he\u2019s learned from a somewhat difficult experience.\n\nWarner supporters say they appreciate his middle-of-the-road approach. \u201cI think he\u2019s his own man. He\u2019s not a guy that\u2019s going to let someone else\u2019s opinion necessarily dictate his,\u201d Daphne Steinberg of Fairfax said outside the senator\u2019s election night party in Alexandria. \u201cOn the other hand, he\u2019s a guy who listens to other people.\u201d Despite being \u201cricher than God,\u201d Warner never seemed out of touch, she said.\n\nLibertarian Robert Sarvis, who ran for governor in 2013 and won over a surprising 6.5 percent of voters, was less of a factor in this race, taking less than 3 percent of the vote in election night totals.\n\nBrian W. Schoeneman, Fairfax County Electoral Board secretary, said county officials are already preparing for a possible recount.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s getting tight,\u201d Schoeneman said. \u201cWe\u2019re in recount territory.\u201d\n\nIn Virginia, the trailing candidate can request a recount if the difference between the two candidates is not more than 1 percent of the total votes cast. In this case, that would translate to roughly 20,000 votes.\n\nRose Mansfield, a spokeswoman for the Virginia Department of Elections, said there were problems in some parts of the state early Tuesday with how voting machines were displaying candidates\u2019 names.\n\nElection night results showed an electorate of over 2 million, about even with the 2010 election but far below the 3.8 million who came out to vote in 2012, the Department of Elections said.\n\nGillespie supporters expressed disappointment that the national Republican Party had not put more resources into the state.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the money was put behind [Gillespie] that should have been put behind him,\u201d Carolyn Roy, a retired flight attendant from Virginia\u2019s Northern Neck, said from the Republican\u2019s election night party.\n\nThe elections also put Virginia\u2019s new voter identification law to the test. Many members of voting rights groups were at the polls to monitor the process and help people comply with the new photo identification rule, among the nation\u2019s strictest. The new requirement tripped up some voters, according to organizations monitoring polling places. By early afternoon, Tram Nguyen, co-executive director of Virginia New Majority, said she had not heard of any reports of voters being denied the right to vote because they lacked proper identification.\n\nAlso on the ballot in Virginia were all 11 congressional seats \u2014 including a hotly contested seat to replace retiring Rep. Frank R. Wolf in the Northern Virginia suburbs. Republican Barbara J. Comstock easily defeated Democrat John W. Foust \u2014 an outcome that may have hurt Warner in a portion of the state where he may have expected to perform well.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The race was so close that Republican Ed Gillespie declined to concede and did not rule out requesting a recount.", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/rachel.elise.weiner", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The race was so close that Republican Ed Gillespie declined to concede and did not rule out requesting a recount.", "title": "Warner claims victory over Gillespie after tight race, but Republican declines to concede", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/warner-gillespie-in-a-tight-race-in-first-wave-of-ballots/2014/11/04/80bb534a-60fd-11e4-9f3a-7e28799e0549_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/10/31/Local-Politics/Images/Senate_Debate-05cfa.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@rachelweinerwp"}, "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Virginia politics, vapolitics, va. politics, mark warner, ed gillespie, us senate, virginia senate, localelection2014", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/rachel.elise.weiner"}, "news_keywords": "Virginia politics, vapolitics, va. politics, mark warner, ed gillespie, us senate, virginia senate, localelection2014", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "eomportal-uuid": "80bb534a-60fd-11e4-9f3a-7e28799e0549"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf465\"", "article_summary": "U.S. Sen.
