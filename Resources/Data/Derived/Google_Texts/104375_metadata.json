He was a man of a people who felt more comfortable in a plain muslin robe than a bejeweled vestment.\n\nSLIDESHOW: Before He Was Pope--Francis' Life in Pictures\n\nBergoglio took the name Francis as his papal name, after St. Francis of Assisi. He was inspired by St. Francis because of that saint\u2019s devotion and sacrifice for the poor. St. Francis was also concerned about the environment, although global warming wasn\u2019t an issue at the turn of the 13th century.\n\nIt hasn\u2019t taken long for Pope Francis to redefine the role of Pope and remind Catholics and the faithful of all religions about what our obligations as human beings are to one another.\n\nHis passion may be the result of growing up in Argentina, the son of an Italian immigrant who fled his homeland because of fascism. Here are TK surprising facts about Pope Francis.\n\nPope Francis\u2019s Surprising Early Life\n\nBergoglio worked as a bar bouncer, a janitor sweeping floors and a chemical tester in a laboratory before he joined the Jesuits.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe loves soccer and is a fan of the San Lorenzo de Almagro football club in Argentina.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe likes the Tango and a related musical genre called Milonga, which was popular in the 1870s.\n\n\n\nAt age 22, he entered the seminary. But he almost quit because he had fallen for a girl and was thinking about foregoing the celibate life.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe tried to learn English while studying the language in Ireland, but it didn\u2019t take.\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the next 30 years, he rose to the position of auxiliary bishop of Buenos Aires and eventually became archbishop. That\u2019s when he earned the moniker \u201cslum bishop\u201d because he increased the number of priests assigned to the poorest areas of the city.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Pope\u2019s plane is called \u201cShepherd One.\u201d\n\nRelated: Pope Radically Simplifies Catholic Marriage Annulment Procedures\n\n\n\nFrancis has been on the covers of Time, Rolling Stone, Esquire and The Advocate. Fortune ranked him number one in their list of great leaders in 2014, and Forbes listed him as the fourth most powerful person in the world that same year.\n\nOn Fiscal Issues\n\nAs archbishop, Bergoglio was something of a spending hawk, with an eye the church\u2019s tendency toward unbridled spending. He sold the archdiocese\u2019s shares in multiple local banks, which were lenient with loans, and reinvested the money in global banks, which had more stringent loan standards. As a result, the church was forced to operate within its means.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs pope, Francis eliminated the traditional bonuses doled out to Vatican employees after a new pope is elected\u2014a cost savings of several million euros -- and he nixed the usual $28,000 paid to cardinals on the board of supervisors for the Vatican Bank. He gave the savings to charity.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat was just the beginning of a reform that would extend throughout the Vatican. He declared that the Vatican Bank \u2013 an institution that made Swiss banks look like Swiss cheese by comparison in terms of transparency \u2013 would no longer be a bastion of secrecy.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe appointed a consulting firm, Promontory Financial Group, to investigate the bank\u2019s affairs and management and he replaced four of the five cardinals who had overseen the Vatican Bank.\n\nHumility and Modesty\n\nAs bishop of Buenos Aires, he washed the feet of people in jails, hospitals, old age homes and the slums on Holy Thursday \u2013 a tradition he continues as Pope.\n\nRelated: Note to Congress: No Gladhanding the Pope\n\nAs a cardinal, he lived in a small apartment rather than the luxurious bishop\u2019s residence. He traveled by public transportation and cooked his own meals. Once again, this rejection of elitism carries through to his papacy. After his election as pope, he returned to his hotel by taking the bus with the other cardinals instead of taking the papal car.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter becoming pope, one typically accepts congratulations seated on the papal throne. Not Francis \u2013 he stood while receiving the cardinals. And he wore a white cassock instead of the fur-trimmed robe typically warn by previous popes.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt a weekly worship meeting with Protestant pastors, Juan Palo Bongarr\u00e1, president of the Argentine Bible Society, remembers, \u201cHe mounted the platform and called for pastors to pray for him. He knelt in front of nearly 6,000 people, and [the Protestant leaders there] laid hands and prayed.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring a joint Catholic-Jewish conference in early 2000\u2019s, Israel Singer recalls, \u201cIf everyone sat in chairs with handles [arms], he would sit in the one without.\u201d\n\nInterfaith Outreach\n\nPope Francis wants d\u00e9tente among the races and religions. He has demonstrated his respect for other faiths over the years by reaching out to other religious leaders and engaging in dialogue. His conversations with Rabbi Abraham Skorka were published in a book, On Heaven and Earth.\n\nRelated: Trump Says \u2018No Interest\u2019 In Buying Pope\u2019s Favorite Soccer Team\n\nFor nearly 1,000 years, Catholic and Orthodox churches have been, well, divorced. The Great Schism of 1054 has yet to heal, but if Francis has his way, a lasting reconciliation could be imminent. Francis\u2019 commitment to social justice and indictment of globalization as detrimental to the poor could bring the two churches together.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrancis is focusing on Islam, possibly because of radical Islam and their treatment of Christians and other minorities in the Middle East. He said he was grateful that so many Islamic clerics attended his \u201cinstallation Mass.\u201d\n\nIncome Inequality\n\nFrancis raised eyebrows in the U.S. and elsewhere when he blamed unbridled capitalism for and consumerism for the suffering of the poor. He suggested that the U.N. call for redistribution of income, and called global banks the new colonialists.\n\nThanks to Wikipedia and other sources for providing much of the information in this article.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Before the smoke turned white at the Vatican on March 13, 2013, people who knew Cardin", "title": "From Bouncer to Pope\u201421 Fascinating Facts About Pope Francis", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/09/21/Bouncer-Pope-21-Fascinating-Facts-About-Pope-Francis", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/Pope_Francis_at_Vargihna.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/09/21/Bouncer-Pope-21-Fascinating-Facts-About-Pope-Francis", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/Pope_Francis_at_Vargihna.jpg", "creator": "@jackieleo", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Before the smoke turned white at the Vatican on March 13, 2013, people who knew Cardin", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdff21\"", "article_summary": "Here are TK surprising facts about Pope Francis.\nSLIDESHOW: Before He Was Pope--Francis' Life in PicturesBergoglio took the name Francis as his papal name, after St. Francis of Assisi.\nSt. Francis was also concerned about the environment, although global warming wasn\u2019t an issue at the turn of the 13th century.\nIt hasn\u2019t taken long for Pope Francis to redefine the role of Pope and remind Catholics and the faithful of all religions about what our obligations as human beings are to one another.\nHe was inspired by St. Francis because of that saint\u2019s devotion and sacrifice for the poor."}
