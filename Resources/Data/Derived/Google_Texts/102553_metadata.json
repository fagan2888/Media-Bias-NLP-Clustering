Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) invited to travel to China with her. (J. Lawler Duggan/For The Washington Post)\n\nD.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser departed for China on Saturday, etching her name on a long list of city leaders who have led delegations to promote tourism and to solicit Chinese investment in the nation\u2019s capital.\n\nWho is traveling with Bowser (D), however, is fueling a fresh round of questions about the relationship between her administration and some donors to a political action committee set up by her former campaign treasurer.\n\nThe mayor\u2019s administration selected 16 business leaders to accompany her, and the city is using taxpayer money to host a series of official events to help them pitch projects directly to Chinese investors. Through one program, Chinese nationals could be awarded U.S. visas for investing $500,000 or more in one of the D.C. developments.\n\nTwo business leaders accompanying Bowser \u2014 developer Buwa Binitie and health-care executive Babu Stephen \u2014 have contributed $10,000 each to the Bowser\u2019s PAC since it was established seven months ago.\n\nA third, David Franco, has not contributed. But he is seeking investment in China for a project that has a silent investor who is the single-largest contributor to the PAC.\n\nD.C. Council member Mary M. Cheh grills a developer accompanying Mayor Muriel Bowser to China about his contribution to a pro-Bowser political action committee. (D.C. Council)\n\n[Super PACs for the White House, now city hall?]\n\nOn the eve of Bowser\u2019s trip, questions about the PAC \u2014 unprecedented in D.C. politics because of how closely it is aligned with the agenda of a sitting mayor \u2014 overshadowed the potential benefits from the trade mission in the D.C. Council chambers.\n\nIn a hearing Thursday on an affordable-housing project, Council member Mary M. Cheh (D-Ward 3) grilled Binitie about his contribution to the PAC and whether he might be receiving special treatment for his political support. Bowser wants to sell a downtown parcel to a group including Binitie and Richard Lake, another developer going to China, to build the development.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what we get out of these trips. I don\u2019t know how people get selected. Is it because they are now plopping down $10,000 or $20,000?\u201d Cheh asked afterward. \u201cIf you add it all up, it just looks really bad. . . . It can only sully the reputation of the mayor.\u201d\n\nBinitie, whom Bowser also appointed to the board of the city\u2019s Housing Finance Agency, declined to comment Friday about the trip or what projects he might bring before Chinese investors. He referred questions to the mayor\u2019s office.\n\nAt a groundbreaking with the mayor for another project on Friday, Binitie said affordable housing was his \u201cpassion,\u201d and he called Bowser the city\u2019s \u201cfearless, fearless, fearless leader.\u201d\n\nBrian Kenner, Bowser\u2019s deputy mayor for planning and economic development, said the administration is focused on getting results from the China trip. The city invited each of the business leaders who will accompany the mayor, he said, because the administration was aware that they had projects in the works that could benefit from foreign capital.\n\nThe mayor\u2019s spokesman, Michael Czin, also defended the invitations.\n\n\u201cEach member of the delegation from D.C. is going for one reason: they have a proven ability to create jobs and grow the District\u2019s economy,\u201d Czin said.\n\nOver the past two years, individual foreign investors have committed or delivered almost $300 million to D.C. projects under the nation\u2019s EB-5 visa program. The District could not immediately say how many visas had been issued in exchange for that investment.\n\n\u201cThe way I like to think about this stuff is that we, as the government, are sort of helping to build a little infrastructure, a bridge . . . and then allowing many of the business sectors that we have in Washington, small and large, to use that bridge to do things over there,\u201d Kenner said.\n\nAlthough Chinese investment in the District has been dwarfed in recent years by money that has rolled in from Qatar, Canada and other countries, the Chinese have become the District\u2019s biggest tourism partner. More people visited the District from China \u2014 221,000 \u2014 last year than from any other country.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing the return in terms of investment, EB-5 and other business expansion,\u201d Kenner said.\n\nBowser follows former mayors, Democrats Marion Barry, Anthony Williams and Vincent C. Gray, who led delegations to China. Adrian M. Fenty (D) also attended the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing.\n\nBowser said she is hoping for a major deal with Chinese investors.\n\n\u201cThey are very interested in D.C., the Chinese, and they are especially interested in big projects, so we want to be able to talk to them about the big projects that haven\u2019t gotten as much attention or may not be as flashy, but still need significant capital,\u201d she said.\n\nThose potential projects include the redevelopment of the former St. Elizabeths Hospital campus, Kenner said.\n\nKenner, along with Bowser chief of staff John Falcicchio and two other D.C. officials, traveled to China in July to set up meetings for the mayor. Among those, the mayor\u2019s office said, is a planned meeting with the head of the Wanda Group, one of China\u2019s wealthiest businessmen.\n\nBowser said she hopes to discuss with Chinese officials how to expand the potential field of EB-5 projects to include affordable housing and charter schools in the District. Bowser has in recent months tried to help raise funds for her priority for a new high school for boys of color.\n\nFranco, a principal with Level 2 Development whom Bowser has nominated to the city\u2019s powerful zoning board, said he would pursue EB-5 money on the trip for his company\u2019s proposed 313-unit High Line residential project near Union Market.\n\nRobert Goodrich, who has invested in that project, has contributed $20,000 to the PAC, which Bowser supporters dubbed Fresh PAC, after her campaign slogan of a \u201cFresh Start.\u201d\n\nFranco said Goodrich was a minor investor, contributing \u201clow single digits\u201d to the $13 million that has been committed so far. He said there was no connection between the PAC contribution and his trip, and he said Goodrich has \u201cno say whatsoever\u201d in the development. He said drawing lines between Goodrich and his trip was connecting \u201c[phantom] dots\u201d and that he has not and will not contribute to Fresh PAC.\n\nStephen, head of D.C. Health Care Inc., did not return calls to his cellphone.\n\nCity officials said the expected cost of the trip for Bowser, Falcicchio, Kenner and five other city officials is about $80,000, not including the mayor\u2019s two-person security detail.\n\nIn all, 38 people are traveling in the delegation, including former mayor Williams; Kurt Newman, president of the Children\u2019s National Health System; Council member Jack Evans (D-Ward 2); and the city\u2019s chief financial officer, Jeffrey DeWitt. Georgetown University President Jack DeGioia will be in China and join the delegation for some meetings.\n\nBowser\u2019s cousin, Christina Ferguson, is also traveling with the group. Like the other non-governmental members of the delegation, the mayor\u2019s office said she is paying her own way.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "dcpolitics, d.c. politics, mayor bowser super pac, freshpac, fresh pac, bowser campaign fundraising, bowser china", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/byaaroncdavis", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "A series of events will help politically connected developers pitch projects to Chinese investors.", "title": "D.C. mayor\u2019s delegation to China includes some top PAC contributors", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/dc-politics/dc-mayors-delegation-to-china-includes-some-top-pac-contributors/2015/11/06/7d1b2a5a-8418-11e5-9afb-0c971f713d0c_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/11/06/Others/Images/2015-11-06/duggan_lawler_bowser_perry_2015_11_06_0171446852426.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@byaaroncdavis"}, "description": "A series of events will help politically connected developers pitch projects to Chinese investors.", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "dcpolitics, d.c. politics, mayor bowser super pac, freshpac, fresh pac, bowser campaign fundraising, bowser china", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/byaaroncdavis"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "eomportal-uuid": "7d1b2a5a-8418-11e5-9afb-0c971f713d0c"}, "article_summary": "Over the past two years, individual foreign investors have committed or delivered almost $300 million to D.C. projects under the nation\u2019s EB-5 visa program.\nDeveloper Buwa Binitie, left, is one of 16 business leaders that D.C.
