They jammed the basepaths with traffic, making them look like a Southern California freeway.\n\nCharlie Blackmon also launched two homers, including a solo shot off closer Craig Kimbrel in the ninth.\n\nAnd yet, the Rockies dropped their fifth straight game, losing 8-6 at Petco Park as the Padres completed a three-game sweep.\n\n\u201cThat team is better than us right now,\u201d Arenado said. \u201cWe need to hit better and pitch better. All around, we just aren\u2019t very good right now. Losing gets contagious \u2026 so we have to turn this around.\u201d\n\nAt the root of the Rockies\u2019 blown chance was another bad performance by starting pitcher Kyle Kendrick, who was charged with six runs on six hits in five innings. He gave up two, two-run homers \u2014 one to Justin Upton, the other to Derek Norris.\n\nKendrick, the free agent from Philadelphia who signed a one-year deal for $5.5 million, fell to 1-4 and his ERA rose to 8.73. His 10 home runs are the most allowed by any major-league pitcher this season.\n\n\u201cThey put some balls in play and hits some good pitches, but the results aren\u2019t there,\u201d Kendrick said.\n\nBut, Kendrick insisted, he has not lost confidence in himself.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t think you can get guys out, then you shouldn\u2019t be out there,\u201d he said. \u201cBut these things are going to happen. Guys hit the balls to where our guys were not today.\u201d\n\nKendrick\u2019s outing marked the seventh consecutive game that a Colorado starter has worked less than six innings. In 16 of Colorado\u2019s 24 games, the starter has worked 5.2 innings or less.\n\nWith Shields looking vulnerable in the first inning, the Rockies desperately needed Kendrick to deliver a shut-down inning, but he was unable to do so. Kendrick\u2019s club gave him a lead twice, and tied the game once, but he let the Padres back into the game every time.\n\nBlackmon led off the game with a solo homer to right off Shields, but in the bottom of the first, Kendrick hit Matt Kemp with two outs and then Upton swatted a two-run homer to right-center, giving San Diego a 2-1 lead.\n\nA leadoff homer by Arenado and a run-scoring single by Michael McKenry put the Rockies back in front, 3-2, in the fourth. So what happened? Kendrick hit Kemp again, gave up a single to Upton, a run-scoring groundout to Yangervis Solarte and a two-run homer to Norris. The Padres were back in the lead, 5-3.\n\nArenado\u2019s second homer of the game \u2014 a two-run shot in the fifth \u2014 tied up the game again, 5-5. But Kendrick couldn\u2019t hold it, again, as Upton delivered an RBI double to score Cory Spangenberg.\n\n\u201cYou want to have shut-down innings after you score,\u201d manager Walt Weiss said. \u201cWe have a good lineup and it\u2019s tough to keep down. But (the Padres) didn\u2019t miss some of the mistakes they saw today.\u201d\n\nThe Rockies had an opportunity to break the game open in the sixth, loading the bases with one out. The chance passed by without a run being scored. Troy Tulowitzki, pinch-hitting for Kendrick, popped out to short and Blackmon grounded out to first.\n\nThe Padres iced the game in the sixth on a two-run homer by pinch-hitter Jedd Gyrko off right-handed reliever Brooks Brown. Gyrko came to the plate hitting 2-for-39 against righties this season, but he drove the ball 438 feet to right, putting the Padres ahead 8-5.\n\nPatrick Saunders: psaunders@denverpost.com or twitter.com/psaundersdp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Kyle Kendrick\u2019s slump continues as Padres sweep Rockies", "title": "Kyle Kendrick\u2019s slump continues as Padres sweep Rockies", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/05/03/kyle-kendricks-slump-continues-as-padres-sweep-rockies/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150503__KENDRICKp1.jpg", "height": 493}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150503__KENDRICKp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-03T17:46:49+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-24T10:17:55+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "And yet, the Rockies dropped their fifth straight game, losing 8-6 at Petco Park as the Padres completed a three-game sweep.\nThe Padres iced the game in the sixth on a two-run homer by pinch-hitter Jedd Gyrko off right-handed reliever Brooks Brown.\nThey battered Padres ace James Shields for five runs on nine hits, including three home runs, two by Nolan Arenado.\nKendrick hit Kemp again, gave up a single to Upton, a run-scoring groundout to Yangervis Solarte and a two-run homer to Norris.\nKendrick\u2019s club gave him a lead twice, and tied the game once, but he let the Padres back into the game every time."}
