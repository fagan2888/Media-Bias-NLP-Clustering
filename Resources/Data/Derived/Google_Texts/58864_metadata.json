Sam Brownback's tax policy has been a \"failure\" or a \"tremendous failure\" in terms of economic growth.\n\n\n\n\"Neither success nor failure\" was the opinion of 32 percent, 7 percent said it was at least \"a success,\" and only 0.2 percent said it was \"a tremendous success.\"\n\n\n\nKansas Speaks 2015 is the seventh in the series of annual surveys conducted by the Docking Institute of Public Affairs at Fort Hays State University.\n\n\n\nAbout three-quarters (76 percent) of respondents to the 2015 Kansas Speaks survey of public opinion in Kansas still think Kansas is at least a \"good\" place to live, a number that is down almost 10 percent from a year ago, when 85 percent thought Kansas was at least a \"good\" place to live.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the \"poor\" or \"very poor\" opinion was up slightly, to 5 percent in 2015 over 3 percent in 2014.\n\n\n\nMore than a third (37 percent) rated the Kansas economy as at least \"good,\" 38 percent said the economy is \"fair,\" and 26 percent rated the economy as \"poor\" or \"very poor.\" The rating was lower among Democrats and those leaning Democrat.\n\n\n\nOver half of respondents, 51 percent, were at least \"moderately concerned\" that the Kansas economy would seriously threaten their or their family\u2019s welfare over the next year, 27 percent were \"slightly concerned,\" and 23 percent were \"not concerned at all.\" Female respondents were more concerned than males, and concern was also high among respondents with lower household incomes. Overall, however, respondents were less concerned in 2015 than they have been since 2009.\n\n\n\nThe Docking Institute of Public Affairs at Fort Hays State University conducted the 2015 Kansas Speaks survey from Sept. 14 to Oct. 5.

The margin of error was 4.1 percent at a 95-percent confidence level.\n\n\n\nFull results of this year's Kansas Speaks will be released Sunday, Oct. 25, in tabloid inserts in The Hays Daily News, The Wichita Eagle and The Topeka Capital-Journal.
