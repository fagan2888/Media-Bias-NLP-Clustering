Magic mushrooms stimulate parts of the "primitive brain" linked to emotion and memory, according to a scientific study published on Thursday in the neuroscience journal Human Brain Mapping.

Researchers injected volunteers with psilocybin, the psychedlic chemical found in magic mushrooms, and observed brain activity with imaging hardware. They discovered that brain activity on psilocybin closely resembles patterns of activity observed when subjects are dreaming.

"Learning about the mechanisms that underlie what happens under the influence of psychedelic drugs can also help to understand their possible uses," says Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris, a researcher from Imperial College London. "We are currently studying the effect of LSD on creative thinking and we will also be looking at the possibility that psilocybin may help alleviate symptoms of depression by allowing patients to change their rigidly pessimistic patterns of thinking."

Last month, Reason TV released a video profiling the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS), a research group focused on developing psychedelics into legal prescription drugs. Watch the video below. The original write-up is beneath.
