Chuck Patch/CC BY-NC 2.0\n\nDoctors and staff providing abortion services are facing a surge of threats and intimidation, according to a new survey from the Feminist Majority Foundation (FMF). This survey is \u201cthe first comprehensive nationwide survey of women\u2019s health clinics since the summer of 2010.\u201d\n\nThere are two major, alarming results: 1) anti-abortion violence continues to impact 19.7 percent of clinics nationwide; the overall percentage of targeted clinics rose from 26.6 percent to 51.9 percent of clinics, and 2) clinics are facing significantly higher and concentrated levels of harassment, including \u201cwanted-style posters.\u201d ThinkProgress reported these posters include sayings like, \u201cKillers Among Us,\u201d \u201cWanted for Killing,\u201d and \u201cStop This Abortionist Now.\u201d\n\nIn addition to posters, abortion clinics receive pamphlets targeting their doctors and staff, as well as find staff personal information and pictures leaked online.\n\n\u201cThey are very much like the flyers used to target physicians in the 90s when they were being shot and killed. They profile their photograph, their name, their place of business\u2019 address, and often their own private residence,\u201d duVergne Gaines, the director of the National Clinic Access Project, told ThinkProgress. Gaines equated these actions to \u201cputting a target on their back.\u201d\n\nAs if this weren\u2019t bad enough, FMF found an increase in anti-abortion extremism, including severe violence, vandalism, and break-ins. The authors wrote, \u201canti-abortion extremists strategically target a vulnerable minority of clinics, aiming to force them to close their doors before moving on to the next set of targets.\u201d Last year, 60 abortion clinics closed, some mandated by anti-abortion law.\n\n\u201cI think the average legislator, and certainly the average citizen, has no idea what is really happening to the abortion providers who care for women\u2019s comprehensive reproductive health. If they did, they would be truly horrified,\u201d Gaines said.\n\nWomen visiting targeted clinics run into problems too. Not only are they made to feel bad or asahamed, researchers associate restricted access to abortion clinics with an increase in intimate partner violence, maternal death, and a decline in general women's health. One such example of shaming was captured by a British journalist Sunny Hundal. Perhaps surprisingly, a pregnant woman merely walking by the protest was the one to speak out against their actions.\n\nLaw enforcement building strong, positive relationships with clinics will be crucial in the fight against harassment. The personal safety of doctors and staff is at risk, so government tracking of incidences of violence can help law enforcement prosecute anti-abortion extremists. ThinkProgress reported when these types of cases make it to court, juries are often quick to crack down.\n\nYet, some doctors are afraid to speak out against their unsafe work conditions.\n\n\u201cThere needs to be a zero tolerance policy for violence against abortion providers in this country,\u201d Vicki Saporta, the president of the National Abortion Federation (NAF), previously told ThinkProgress. \u201cRegardless of how people think about a woman\u2019s right to choose, violence is never warranted, and people can\u2019t try to justify acts of violence and terrorism.\u201d\n\nSource: duVergne Ganies, et al. 2014 National Clinic Violence Survey.
