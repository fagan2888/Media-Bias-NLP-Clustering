But the last bit of warmth will be accompanied by heavy wind, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nAfter the city peaked at 56 degrees Sunday afternoon, cold wind arrived Sunday evening. Loveland Pass was closed Sunday night so crews could do avalanche control in preparation for the storm, according to the state Department of Transportation.\n\nMotorists were being urged to use Interstate 70 instead.\n\nThe Front Range mountains and foothills could see gusts up to 70 mph, and Denver could see gusts up to 40 mph Monday.\n\nOn the backside of the wind is an arctic cold front that will drop the metro area\u2019s temperature by more than 32 degrees from Monday to Tuesday. The city might only reach freezing Tuesday, but it won\u2019t get nearly as warm in the days that follow, forecasters said Sunday.\n\nDenver is expected to face its coldest temperatures so far this season: forecast lows of 7 degrees Tuesday night, followed by overnight lows of zero or below from Wednesday through Saturday nights.\n\nHigh temperatures in the city aren\u2019t expected to get out of the teens from Wednesday through Sunday, forecasters warned.\n\nThe average daily high for this week is 44 degrees each day, according to weather records.\n\nThe Front Range isn\u2019t expected to receive a significant amount of snow from the system, but the mountains could pick up 4 inches to 8 inches, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nDenver normally gets 8,2 inches of snow in December. The city received 5.2 inches last year, and 16.5 inches in 2011.\n\nThis week\u2019s inclement weather coincides with the 100-year anniversary of the biggest blizzard in city history \u2014 45.7 inches from Dec. 1 to Dec. 5, 1913.\n\nThe second-worst blizzard was March 17-19, 2003, when Denver got 31.8 inches, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nJoey Bunch: 303-954-1174, jbunch@denverpost.com or twitter.com/joeybunch", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "High winds, bitter cold headed to Colorado this week", "title": "High winds, bitter cold headed to Colorado this week", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/12/01/high-winds-bitter-cold-headed-to-colorado-this-week/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131201__a_Blizzard1913CivicCenterp1.jpg", "height": 426}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131201__a_Blizzard1913CivicCenterp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-12-01T19:07:51+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T14:41:11+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcea13\"", "article_summary": "The second-worst blizzard was March 17-19, 2003, when Denver got 31.8 inches, according to the National Weather Service.\nBut the last bit of warmth will be accompanied by heavy wind, according to the National Weather Service.\nThe average daily high for this week is 44 degrees each day, according to weather records.\nDenver\u2019s high temperature Monday is expected to reach 65 degrees \u2014 22 degrees above normal \u2014 before plunging into the single digits by Tuesday night.\nHigh temperatures in the city aren\u2019t expected to get out of the teens from Wednesday through Sunday, forecasters warned."}
