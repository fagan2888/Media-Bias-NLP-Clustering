The surgery was scheduled for June 10 and, as hoped, the Georgia grandmother emerged from surgery on Tuesday tumor-free.\n\nLewis\u2019 cystic tumor was benign, but its massive size had displaced her organs up and to the left. Worse, it had attached itself to the stomach wall and eventually her small intestine and other organs, significantly upping the risk of injury during surgery. Doctors at Emory University performed the eight-hour operation, which ended up removing 12 to 13 liters of fluid from the tumor. It was so huge, in fact, that it ruptured during the procedure.\n\nDr. Alan Gordon, Division Director in Emory\u2019s Gynecologic Oncology department, said that without the surgery, Lewis\u2019 27-pound tumor would have kept on growing, possibly affecting her breathing and digestive system. Even before the surgery, Lewis reported occasional pain. \u201cIt's getting bigger every day,\u201d she told WSB-TV in May. \u201cI can feel it on my body. My heart hurts a little bit.\u201d\n\nThe tumor had actually been growing inside Lewis\u2019 abdomen for several years. Initially, she thought she was just gaining weight. But complications started to snowball when her husband died, leaving her to fend for her own health without insurance. Her attempts to secure an operation led to a dead end at four separate hospitals. It wasn\u2019t until a desperate 911 call, with Lewis complaining of unbearable pain, that she was rushed to Emory University Hospital and told she would be cared for with or without insurance.\n\nOn the heels of a successful surgery, Lewis is expected to be up and walking sometime this week. Her family, for their part, is just relieved to see her alive and well. \u201cIt was very frightening seeing her sick, seeing her throwing up, seeing this thing in her stomach,\u201d her daughter, Sarina Lewis, told the news station. \u201cIt will be so much better when I get to see her face and just see her alive.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "georgia, doctors, remove, 27, pound, tumor, belly, doris, lewis, woman, without, health", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Doris Lewis was scheduled in May to receive a surgery freeing her from a 27-pound tumor.
