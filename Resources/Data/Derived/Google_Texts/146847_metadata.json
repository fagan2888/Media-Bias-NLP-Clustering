Hobby Lobby that for-profit employers can use religious exemptions to avoid paying for contraceptive coverage under the Affordable Care Act. Soon after the decision was handed down, pro-choice protestors descended upon the grand opening of a Hobby Lobby store in New Jersey. Some of the seasoned protestors held their original and dog-eared NOW (National Organization for Women) signs.\n\n\n\nHere we are in 2015 still fighting for equal access to health care for all women. For many years, women's health-care providers have faced a barrage of anti-access legislation at the state level, including restrictions on medication, abortions, bans on private insurance coverage and unduly burdensome doctor and clinic regulations. Many providers have been forced to close their doors making it increasingly difficult for women to access health care. As evidenced last week in Colorado, anti-choice extremists will go to frightening lengths to limit choice.\n\n\n\nSupporters of equal access to women's health care must set aside complacency and join forces with women like those who held their NOW signs in the 1970s and who still hold them today. We cannot assume that the right to control our own reproductive destiny or to access affordable and quality health care is a given.\n\nMandi Perlmutter is Coordinator of Advocacy and Community Engagement for the National Council of Jewish Women Essex County Section.\n\nFollow The Star-Ledger on Twitter @starledger.
