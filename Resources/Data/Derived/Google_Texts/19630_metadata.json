Ted Cruz of Texas had just come off an appearance in Williamsport on his way to Allentown when he gave his stump speech, billing himself as the best candidate to face off with probable Democratic presidential nominee and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.\n\nHis enthusiastic supporters often interrupted with interjections throughout his 40-minute talk, shouting \u201cnever Trump,\u201d \u201cdefund PP (Planned Parenthood)\u201d and \u201cabolish abortion.\u201d After a time, he stopped acknowledging the frequent outbursts.\n\nIf the crowd counts are an indication, Cruz has his work cut out for him. The Radisson ballroom set up for about 370 seats was filled. Those were joined by more than 100 others standing, typical of his draw at Keystone State appearances. The GOP frontrunner, billionaire businessman Donald Trump, on the other hand, recently drew 6,000 to the Pennsylvania Farm Show Complex.\n\n\u201cGod bless the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and God bless the people of Scranton,\u201d Cruz began. \u201cThe entire nation is looking toward Pennsylvania.\u201d\n\nHe called his supporters patriots who have come out to fight for the country. As the nominee, Trump would be defeated in the general election, he said, citing polls, and the GOP possibly would lose the House and Senate. Given the opening on the U.S. Supreme Court, conservatives would \u201close the Supreme Court for a generation.\u201d\n\nHe delivered a message of tax cuts and deregulation, saying those would bring millions of jobs back from Mexico and China and increase wages. He would repeal the Affordable Care Act. He would impose a flat tax and abolish the Internal Revenue Service.\n\nFor the seeming chaos and tension on the GOP side, Cruz pointed to the Democratic side, saying it consists of \u201ca wide-eyed socialist with ideas dangerous to the world and Bernie Sanders,\u201d a U.S. senator from Vermont.\n\n\u201cWant to know the quickest way to clear our a Bernie Sanders rally? Tell everyone there they have to get a job,\u201d he said.\n\nCruz cast Trump as an appeaser who supported Democrats. He maligned the New Yorker for his \u201cneutral\u201d position on the Israeli conflict. Cruz said he would offer unquestioned support of Israel.\n\nHe noted that Trump opposed the controversial North Carolina law that, among other things, prohibited transgender people from using the bathroom that conforms with their gender identity.\n\n\u201cTrump agrees with Hillary and (President Barack) Obama that grown men should be able to go to little girls\u2019 bathrooms,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is political correctness run amok.\u201d\n\nHe called on the people in the audience to unite, and then work to unite the party and the nation.\n\n\u201cOur task is to bring the party together, then we have to unite this country,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we stand together, we will win the nomination and we will win the general election.\u201d\n\ndfalchek@timesshamrock.com", "article_metadata": {"author": "DAVID FALCHEK, STAFF WRITER", "title": "Cruzing through Scranton, Ted talks to 500", "robots": "ACAP allow-index", "DC.creator": "DAVID FALCHEK, STAFF WRITER", "tout": {"article": {"id": "1.2034160"}}, "keywords": "Local", "DC.subject": "Local", "DC.title": "Cruzing through Scranton, Ted talks to 500"}, "article_summary": "The crowd of more than 500 chanted \u201cCruz, Cruz\u201d as the Republican presidential candidate took the dais at the Radisson Lackawanna Station Hotel in Scranton as part of a tour of Pennsylvania before Tuesday\u2019s primary.\n\u201cThis is political correctness run amok.\u201dHe called on the people in the audience to unite, and then work to unite the party and the nation.\nThe GOP frontrunner, billionaire businessman Donald Trump, on the other hand, recently drew 6,000 to the Pennsylvania Farm Show Complex.\n\u201cGod bless the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and God bless the people of Scranton,\u201d Cruz began.\nIf the crowd counts are an indication, Cruz has his work cut out for him."}
