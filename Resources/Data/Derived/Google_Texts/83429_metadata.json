The tale of two successful Buffett purchases is illuminating, but not quite in the way Buffett intends.\n\nThe Fortune editors have run it out under the headline, \u201cBuffett\u2019s annual letter: What you can learn from my real estate investments.\u201d\n\nBuffett writes that the purchases \u2014 a 400-acre farm in Nebraska and a retail property in Manhattan \u201cadjacent to New York University\u201d \u2014 \u201cillustrate certain fundamentals of investing.\u201d\n\nHe goes for several hundred words, naming five points that are supposedly illustrated by his real estate deals. \u201cKeep things simple and don\u2019t swing for the fences.\u201d \u201cFocus on the future productivity of the asset you are considering.\u201d\n\nThey\u2019re all more or less unobjectionable, but they also both overlook one important point that both real estate investments had in common \u2014 Buffett bought them from the American government, i.e., from us taxpayers, at prices that turned out in retrospect to be ridiculously cheap.\n\nBuffett\u2019s letter discloses that he bought the Nebraska farm from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in 1986. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), part of the federal government, had gotten it from a bank that it took over.\n\nAnd Buffett and his partners bought the New York City property in 1993 from the Resolution Trust Corp., a government agency created to, as Buffett put it, \u201cdispose of the assets of failed savings institutions.\u201d\n\nBuffett goes on and on boasting about what great investments he made by purchasing the two properties. \u201cNow, 28 years later, the farm has tripled its earnings and is worth five times or more what I paid,\u201d he writes. As for the New York property, \u201cAnnual distributions now exceed 35 percent of our initial equity investment. Moreover, our original mortgage was refinanced in 1996 and again in 1999, moves that allowed several special distributions totaling more than 150 percent of what we had invested.\u201d\n\nHe writes that \u201cthe two investments will be solid and satisfactory holdings for my lifetime and, subsequently, for my children and grandchildren.\u201d\n\nIt seems to me that among the \u201ccertain fundamentals\u201d of Buffett-style investing that these two stories illustrate are \u201cbuy things from the government, because you can sometimes get bargains from bureaucrats who have no idea of the value of what they are selling, and who have a mandate just to sell the stuff off quickly.\u201d\n\nIn other words, while Buffett boasts of his great real estate bargains, the ones paying the bills are the taxpayers. The savings and loan bailout cost taxpayers an estimated $130 billion. The insurance premiums that banks pay to the FDIC to cover failures mean the banks pay less in taxable dividends to shareholders and less in taxable interest to depositors.\n\nWhich brings us to a certain fundamental of public policy, perhaps one as fundamental as Buffett\u2019s fundamental of investing. The government should avoid the real estate business. It winds up selling assets to people like Buffett when prices are low.\n\nThe story also surfaces a second related and also fundamental point, also unmentioned by Buffett: assets are more valuable in private hands than in government hands.\n\nFinally, it\u2019s worth noting that these two real estate investments touted by Buffett in his Berkshire Hathaway shareholder letter were apparently made by him personally, rather than by Berkshire Hathaway, the public company in which he is a major shareholder. In another proposed deal with government, Buffett mixed the two. In his October 8, 2008, \u201cDear Hank,\u201d letter to Treasury Secretary\n\nHenry Paulson, Buffett outlined a deal in which, in the words of the letter, \u201cThe company I head, Berkshire Hathaway, would be pleased to invest $500 million\u201d and \u201cI would be willing to personally buy $100 million of stock in this public offering. (This constitutes about 20 percent of my net worth outside of my Berkshire holdings, which as you know are promised to charity.)\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t begrudge Buffett his success in real estate investing. In fact, I\u2019m happy he\u2019s prospering. But that feeling is tempered by some chagrin at the realization that, as an American citizen and taxpayer, I\u2019m one of the people who sold him the property at such a deeply discounted price.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "How did Warren Buffett get his property so cheap?
