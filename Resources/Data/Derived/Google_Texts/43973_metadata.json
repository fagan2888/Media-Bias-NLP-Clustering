Dallas has already done it, though it\u2019s been a few years (since 1984). Denver\u2019s already done it.\n\n\u201cBut really, that\u2019s not a huge factor.\u201d\n\nMore important, she said, is that each of the competing cities \u2014 also including Kansas City, Mo., and Cleveland \u2014 realizes the scope of the commitment its leaders would be making if picked to host the convention. That includes raising more than $60 million.\n\nRNC officials have made flattering comments in each of the four cities they\u2019ve visited this month, making it appear they\u2019re just as eager to please as their potential hosts. That was certainly true during a news conference Tuesday at Denver\u2019s Pepsi Center.\n\nMickelsen\u2019s comments Wednesday in the baggage-claim area at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport came after a welcoming committee of party volunteers, Dallas Cowboys cheerleaders and the team\u2019s mascot greeted about two dozen arriving members of the Republican delegation.\n\nThe cowboy-hat-wearing volunteers\u2019 greeting at the gate \u2014 \u201cWelcome to Dallas!\u201d \u2014 surprised a few fellow travelers who weren\u2019t members of the delegation. When the site-visit group entered the baggage-claim area, the two cheerleaders were waiting.\n\nMickelsen was escorted arm in arm for several strides by Rowdy, the Cowboys\u2019 mascot, complete with a Texas-sized hat.\n\nThe delegation will spend Thursday, its only full day in Dallas, touring the American Airlines Center arena and meeting with local bid leaders, before departing Friday. The RNC is expected to choose a host city in coming months.\n\nJon Murray: 303-954-1405, jmurray@denverpost.com or twitter.com/JonMurray", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "2016 RNC visits: In Dallas, Denver\u2019s experience gets different play", "title": "2016 RNC visits: In Dallas, Denver\u2019s experience gets different play", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/06/11/2016-rnc-visits-in-dallas-denvers-experience-gets-different-play/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140612__rnc-dallas-site-visitp1.jpg", "height": 517}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140612__rnc-dallas-site-visitp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-11T17:58:28+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T09:35:20+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccc68\"", "article_summary": "DALLAS \u2014 Different day, different city \u2014 and a different take on Denver.\n\u201cThat\u2019s not a big consideration,\u201d Mickelsen said Wednesday, after a Dallas reporter asked how much weight she would give Denver\u2019s Democratic convention experience.\nEnid Mickelsen, the chairwoman of the Republican National Convention Site Selection Committee, downplayed the importance of Denver\u2019s experience in comments to the Dallas media at the airport.\nAfter talking up this week Denver\u2019s success in hosting the 2008 Democratic National Convention, the chief site scout for the 2016 Republican convention sounded a different tone upon arriving in Dallas on Wednesday.\nThat was just one day after she said Denver\u2019s successful hosting of the Democratic National Convention six years ago was \u201cvery impressive,\u201d and Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus called it \u201ca big advantage\u201d for Denver."}
