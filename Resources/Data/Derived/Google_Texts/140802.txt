Our country has overcome many challenges over the past 240 years. The country has been successful in solving these challenges, which include two world wars, a number of other wars, placing a man on the moon, and serving as the de facto leader of the free world.

For the past seven years we, “the people,” have been trying to climb a slippery slope that has resulted in losing much ground to the big-government machine in Washington. We have almost 50 million people on food stamps, the same number in poverty, a record number of people who have dropped out of the workforce, an insane Iran deal, and Obamacare is disintegrating.

We are facing a significant rise in the strength and boldness of the Chinese and Russian military while the US military is rapidly falling to pre-WWII strength. Given these problems, and many more, it is absolutely ludicrous that a sitting president would involve himself in the “which restroom” debate. Even more ludicrous is the position that he has taken regarding school restrooms. He has ordered every public school district in the country to allow transgender students to use the bathrooms that match the gender identity they have chosen, else face the loss of federal funds — totally illegal.

How sad we have fallen so far under this administration.
