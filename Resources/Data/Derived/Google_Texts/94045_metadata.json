He is the first Minnesotan to win the Medal of Courage from the National Wrestling Hall of Fame, for example, and is thought to be the first blind member of the Minnesota legislature. If things go his way in November, he could become the first Republican in nearly a quarter-century to defeat Collin Peterson, the Democratic incumbent running for reelection in the state\u2019s seventh congressional district.\n\nHis Republican challenger, Westrom, a state senator and attorney from Elbow Lake, Minn., is hoping that Peterson\u2019s electoral hot streak comes to an end before his own does. Peterson, 70, has held the seat since 1991; Westrom, 41, hasn\u2019t lost an election since he first ran for the state house at age 23. Peterson has managed to easily fend off challengers in the past, usually raking in about two-thirds of the vote, but Westrom poses a more serious threat.\n\nFirst, the rural district\u2019s political makeup is heavily in the Republican\u2019s favor. The Cook Political Report\u2019s Partisan Voting Index, which compares local presidential voting patterns to national trends, rates the seventh district as R+6, one of the most lopsided partisan skews in any district, Republican or Democratic, held by a member of the opposing party.\n\nSecond, Peterson is increasingly falling out of step with his district, as Westrom aims to highlight. Peterson bucks his party from time to time, most notably by voting against Obamacare. Only 34 House Democrats did so, and of those, only four remain in the House and are running this cycle. That vote has helped Peterson survive in his relatively conservative district, but Westrom and Republicans argue that the Democrat\u2019s actions don\u2019t match his rhetoric, and that his recent votes on Obamacare position him no longer as a detractor of the law but as a defender.\n\n\u201cHe can talk a conservative-Democrat game out here, but it doesn\u2019t match his walk in Washington,\u201d Westrom told National Review Online during the Box Car Days parade held over Labor Day weekend in Tracy, Minn., not far from Walnut Grove, where children\u2019s author Laura Ingalls Wilder grew up \u201cThere\u2019s a disconnect.\u201d\n\nPeterson has said that he\u2019d vote against Obamacare if the bill were before the House today, but he hasn\u2019t gone so far as to vote for repealing it. He alternates between knuckling under to the Democratic leadership, which resists revising the law, and spurts of cooperation with Republican-backed efforts to pare it down. Even then, Peterson admits that at times he has sided with Republicans for political reasons \u2014 he did not want to give them \u201cammunition to shoot at me\u201d \u2014 especially if he knew the bill had no chance of moving forward.\n\nMinnesotans don\u2019t like what they\u2019re getting from Obamacare so far, Westrom says, and they are worried about how small businesses will be affected when the law\u2019s various new regulations and mandates kick in later this year. \u201cThis next wave of Obamacare isn\u2019t going to be better \u2014 it\u2019s going to be worse,\u201d he warns from the bed of the campaign\u2019s pickup truck at the parade, over the noise from the local cheerleading squad in the float ahead.\n\nWestrom also vows to take on other issues on which Peterson, he says, has fallen short, including the national debt and onerous Environmental Protection Agency water-quality regulations that impose unnecessary burdens on farmers. He says he\u2019ll push hard for construction of the Keystone XL pipeline.\n\nBut even as he paints the Democrat as a water carrier for President Obama and Nancy Pelosi, Westrom knows that knocking Peterson off will be no easy task. There\u2019s a reason Peterson has represented the district for this long: He served as chairman of the House Agricultural Committee and is currently the ranking minority member, a fact that carries considerable weight in the rural district. Westrom knows that, and he makes sure to tout his own agricultural bona fides, voicing his support for the most recent farm bill and highlighting his upbringing on a dairy farm.\n\nIt was on that dairy farm that Westrom lost his eyesight in a car accident at age 14. He was back to tossing bales of hay a few weeks later, and then took up wrestling. He enjoyed a successful high-school career on the mat and in 2012 was inducted into the National Wrestling Hall of Fame and awarded its Medal of Courage. In the 2000s, he was appointed to a federal advisory panel related to return-to-work issues for people with disabilities.\n\nWestrom half-jokes that his condition has made him \u201ca good listener,\u201d which has served him well working with Republicans and Democrats in St. Paul, as well as with constituents and potential voters. Listening to those potential voters requires that he put in a great deal of mileage: The district is unusually large, about the size of South Carolina, and stretches from the northern tip of Minnesota to just short of the Iowa border.\n\nWhile many analysts still have the race as \u201cleans Democratic,\u201d that\u2019s just one rating away from \u201ctoss up,\u201d and Westrom\u2019s history of beating longer odds than that has him optimistic that he will be moving to Washington soon.\n\n\u2014 Andrew Johnson is an editorial associate at National Review Online.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.date": "Tue, 2014-09-09 13:00", "sailthru.author": "Andrew Johnson", "description": "Torrey Westrom has some notable firsts to his name.
