Jaadin Andersen, 28, newly unemployed and expecting her first child Dec. 8, is bursting with anticipation.

"I'm ready to meet her," Ms. Andersen said as she prepared dinner in her Crown Heights, Brooklyn, apartment on a recent Saturday, waiting for her husband, Jeffrey, to return from his job as a carpenter in Bedford-Stuyvesant.

Ms. Andersen's daughter will arrive shortly after the family joined Medi-Share, a type of health coverage little known in New York but common in the Bible Belt. Christian health-care-sharing ministries are nonprofit cooperatives that mimic health-insurance companies.

But Ms. Andersen bought a service that seems to be flying under the radar of New York state insurance regulators. And she is paying more for less coverage than is available under the Affordable Care Act.

Under the health-care-sharing ministry model, before coverage kicks in, a household pays a monthly fee that "is matched with another's eligible medical bills," according to Christian Care Ministry's website, which coordinates Medi-Share's program. "You will know every month whose bills you are paying, and when you have eligible bills, your fellow believers will be sharing those and praying for you."

The model offers no consumer protections, critics charge. Courts in some states have ruled that health-care-sharing ministries can operate as long as they make it abundantly clear that they do not guarantee that members' medical bills will be paid.

"These companies are walking a fine line," said Glenn Cohen, faculty director of the Petrie-Flom Center for Health Law Policy, Biotechnology and Bioethics at Harvard Law School. "On the one hand, they're telling courts and regulators they're not insurance. On the other, they're telling people, 'You don't need insurance. Use us instead.' "

Nationally, membership in health-care-sharing ministries exploded with the ACA's passage in 2010. Promoting itself with the tagline "Affordable, biblical health care," Medi-Share has 108,000 members nationwide, up 200% since 2010. Membership is concentrated in states with large Christian congregations, such as Texas.

In New York, deemed the nation's 30th-most-Christian state by the Association of Statisticians of American Religious Bodies, Medi-Share membership was 1,734 in October, more than 2.5 times its pre-ACA enrollment. About 12% of those members live in the city.

'Unbiblical' needs nixed

Medi-Share membership is restricted to those who "lead biblical lifestyles and have chosen not to share in the cost of medical care resulting from unbiblical lifestyle choices, such as abortion or drug abuse," according to its website. "That makes for a healthier group of people to care for, and a lower cost for our members."

Ms. Andersen was working as an office manager in Manhattan when she became pregnant. Her monthly insurance premiums would have been $550 had she stayed at the $30,000-a-year job. But she quit to become a stay-at-home mom for a while, planning to sell crafts for extra cash.

Her husband's employer offered coverage through Brooklyn HealthWorks, a low-cost insurance program for small businesses in the borough. Ms. Andersen said premiums for the family would have been more than $1,500 per month, leaving them with "nothing left over."

The couple briefly considered exploring New York State of Health, the Obamacare exchange. But they assumed Mr. Andersen's $50,000 income would have made them ineligible for subsidized premiums. In fact, they would have qualified for a sizable subsidy and 10 different plan options cheaper than Medi-Share.

ACA exemption

A friend from church suggested Medi-Share. For $350 monthly, the family would be covered for eligible medical bills that exceed $4,000. The Christian model appealed to Ms. Andersen. Most Medi-Share members learn of the sharing model through word of mouth, the Christian press or home-schooling magazines, said Joel Noble, vice president of the Alliance of Health Care Sharing Ministries, which represents Medi-Share.

But Congress drove the biggest boost in membership. In a nod to religious freedom, it said joining a health-care-sharing ministry satisfied the ACA's individual mandate for coverage. Members flocked to the ministry; between September 2013 and October 2014, nearly 45,000 Christians signed up.

Medi-Share prominently markets itself around the ACA exemption. "Health-care-sharing ministries like Medi-Share have a special provision in the law, and members of Medi-Share are exempt from the requirement that all Americans purchase insurance or face penalties," reads its website.

Mark Scherzer, a Manhattan attorney specializing in health coverage, said any exemption request must be filed with an exchange or the IRS.

Medi-Share's position that it is not an insurer, critics say, allows it to operate outside the reach of regulators. A Kentucky judge ruled in 2012 that Medi-Share should be regulated as an insurer and ordered that it cease operations in the state until it received a proper insurance license. Kentucky passed legislation that lifted the ban last year.

New York's insurance regulator, the Department of Finance, did not respond to requests for comment.

Members are "pushing against faith" when they participate, conceded the ministry alliance's Mr. Noble. Of the model's 30-year-plus record, he said that "there's never been a time when a need that would have met the guidelines and requirements for sharing was not taken care of."

Ms. Andersen said she likes knowing exactly whose medical needs she is contributing money to, because then she can pray for them.

The ministry has a list of "unbiblical procedures or treatments" it won't cover: abortion, HIV and sexually transmitted diseases, maternity care for unwed mothers, mammograms, colonoscopies, infertility, immunizations and vaccinations except for babies, and mental health. Medi-Share also won't cover treatment if a member drove drunk when injured in a car accident.

"I don't have a problem with that," said Ms. Andersen. "The Christian faith says you're not supposed to be drunk with wine, so if you sign something saying you aren't going to be drunk and then you are, they don't have to cover that."

As for her family's coverage, that is something she has faith in.
