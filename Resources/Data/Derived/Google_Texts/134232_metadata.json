But in an exclusive interview tonight, Carson tells our Sinclair Broadcast Group national correspondent Jeff Barnd he is in the race for the White House in 2016.\n\nI TMm willing to be part of the equation and therefore, I TMm announcing my candidacy for President of the United States of America, Carson said.\n\nWith that, Carson is off and running. He rose from poverty in Detroit to the head of pediatric neurosurgery at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore.\n\nHe TMs now retired from medicine.\n\nMany people have suggested to me that I should run for president, even though I TMm not a politician, Carson said.\n\nCarson TMs political star rose at the National Prayer Breakfast two years ago when he admonished President Obama for several White House policies, including Obamacare.\n\nI began to ask myself why are people clamoring for me to do this? I represented a lot of the same thoughts that they have, Carson said. I TMm not 100 percent sure ~politics as usual TM is going to save us. I think we are in a severe problem | a problematic situation.\n\nCarson TMs own words at times have caused controversy in recent months regarding Obamacare and homosexuality.\n\nNow that you TMve announced you TMre running for President of the United States, Barnd said, What have you learned from those experiences?\n\nI don TMt wander off into those extraneous areas that can be exploited, Carson said. I have learned that.\n\nCarson himself shuns political correctness and says today TMs society is too divisive.\n\nHe calls himself a reluctant warrior and realizes he can TMt solve all the problems currently plaguing the country.\n\nYou must have enough humility to be able to work with others to recognize you TMre not necessarily the expert in everything, Carson said. But you can with very good advice, make good decisions.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Republican field of candidates continues to widen.", "title": "Obamacare critic Dr. Ben Carson says he'll run for president", "og": {"site_name": "KGBT", "description": "The Republican field of candidates continues to widen.", "title": "Obamacare critic Dr. Ben Carson says he'll run for president", "url": "http://valleycentral.com/news/local/obamacare-critic-dr-ben-carson-says-hell-run-for-president", "image": "http://static-12.sinclairstoryline.com/resources/media/adad1109-e282-4fa2-982a-14adef5ea017-BenCarson.jpg?1440555758909", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "http://twitter.com/kgbt", "image": "http://static-11.sinclairstoryline.com/resources/media/adad1109-e282-4fa2-982a-14adef5ea017-BenCarson.jpg?1440555758909", "description": "The Republican field of candidates continues to widen.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Obamacare critic Dr. Ben Carson says he'll run for president"}, "author": "Sinclair Broadcast Group", "blitz": "mu-cc36119f-f4dca522-3261b206-4b3bbd3f", "robots": "index, follow", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 938960942857073}, "keywords": "news,local,TX", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cbs4rgv", "published_time": "2015-05-03T23:00:00+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=0.5"}, "article_summary": "Carson TMs own words at times have caused controversy in recent months regarding Obamacare and homosexuality.\nCarson TMs political star rose at the National Prayer Breakfast two years ago when he admonished President Obama for several White House policies, including Obamacare.\nNow that you TMve announced you TMre running for President of the United States, Barnd said, What have you learned from those experiences?\nI TMm willing to be part of the equation and therefore, I TMm announcing my candidacy for President of the United States of America, Carson said.\nMany people have suggested to me that I should run for president, even though I TMm not a politician, Carson said."}
