Chuck Nash talking about what we need to do to help resolve the crisis in the Ukraine. What he said made a lot of sense, but it struck me that we all know that President Obama will do absolutely nothing he recommended.\n\nThere are so many crises like that around the world and here at home that could be solved entirely or at least ameliorated by the president. The long list of actions President Obama should take to resolve many crises around the world describes many that are \u2014 or at least were before Obama \u2014 in America\u2019s interests and within America\u2019s grasp. We can take it to the bank that Obama will do none of these things. It takes only a few examples to illustrate the point.\n\nAfter about ten days of public outrage, Europe has reverted to its Cold War default position, the appeasement of neo-Soviet Russia. For all the harrumphing about new sanctions, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande has said that the sale of two warships to Russia will proceed on schedule. Yesterday\u2019s Washington Post op-ed by Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko called for serious sanctions against Russia to demonstrate the world\u2019s seriousness about stopping the Russian insurgents (and that\u2019s what they are, not \u201cseparatists\u201d but a Russian proxy force) from taking over his country. He wrote that the U.S. could help with shipments of natural gas to strengthen the Ukrainian economy against Russian blackmail. He wants the U.S. to organize a coalition of nations to stop Russian aggression. It won\u2019t happen.\n\nObama could send military aid to Ukraine to reverse the gains the Russian-backed insurgents have made. But he won\u2019t do that either.\n\nWe know that the Israelis keep declaring cease-fires in Gaza but the Hamas terrorist government there keeps violating them. Secretary of State Kerry, negotiating with whomever will talk to him (a shrinking cohort), wants to blame Israel for the continued killing. The Israelis are ignoring Kerry and Obama because their prescriptions for peace place all of the burdens and all of the risk on Israel, not the terrorists of Hamas and Islamic Jihad who fire rockets aimed at Israeli civilians. All Obama was willing to do was to effectively blockade Israel by banning civilian flights to its principal airport for forty-eight hours. He takes no notice of Palestinian rockets, or their using concrete not to build schools but to construct tunnels into Israel to mount terrorist attacks.\n\nWe also know that the president wants about $3 billion in added funding to help \u201cprocess\u201d the flood of illegal aliens coming across our borders. Senate Democrats don\u2019t want to interfere with the flow of illegals across the border, so they\u2019re combining unrelated issues \u2014 such as the Pentagon\u2019s request for $225 million to help Israel fund the construction of its Iron Dome anti-rocket system that protects its citizens from Hamas and IJ rockets fired from Gaza \u2014 with the border funding and aid to states for problems such as wildfires.\n\nHe could demand that the Iron Dome aid be passed separately and immediately because our only ally in the Middle East needs it. He could tell Harry Reid to pass an amendment to the Bush-era law that essentially blocks the immediate deportation of Central American children. And he could cut foreign aid to the nations who are propelling the illegal immigration. But he won\u2019t do any of those things.\n\nSome pundits are proclaiming that Obama has just given up, that he\u2019s more interested in raising funds for Democrats and playing golf than in working with international leaders and Senate Dems to solve the problems. That\u2019s wrong, because it overlooks the primary political strategy that propelled Obama to the presidency and which he has stuck with through more than five years of his presidency.\n\nObama\u2019s principal strategy, from the beginning of his 2008 campaign (which began the moment he was elected to the Senate in 2004) has been to create divisive issues and blame the Republican Party for failing to solve them.\n\nWhen first in office, Obama offered his \u201ceconomic stimulus\u201d plan. Hundreds of billions of dollars would be funneled into \u201cshovel ready\u201d projects after first being taxed away from the American people. A vastly better alternative was offered by Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-TX) in the form of a tax holiday that would have actually stimulated the economy by leaving tax money in the hands of businesses \u2014 large and small \u2014 that could have used it to invest in jobs, plants, and equipment. But Obama had an issue that he and the press ran with. His program didn\u2019t stimulate the economy. Large parts of the money were spent on Obama\u2019s pals and pet issues. Remember Solyndra, which had over $500 million in federally guaranteed loans supposedly going to \u201cinvest\u201d in alternatives to global warming? It didn\u2019t stimulate anything. It just filled the pockets of some of the president\u2019s pals before the company went bankrupt.\n\nObama wanted an issue, not a solution. He got it.\n\nYou will remember the Obamacare debate. It consumed the entire nation\u2019s political energy for almost eighteen months. Obama campaigned for it relentlessly. Not only did his lie about \u201cif you like your insurance plan you can keep your insurance plan\u201d dominate the headlines, but his equally important lie was that Republicans had no alternatives to it. The media, the ideological bit in its teeth, ran with the lie despite the fact that Rep. Tom Price (R-GA), himself a medical doctor, had a vastly better alternative introduced in a bill that would have left medical decisions to doctors and patients and not the government.\n\nAgain, Obama wanted an issue, not a solution. Now, when the opportunity presents itself, Obama is doing almost the same thing on foreign policy.\n\nI say almost, not exactly, because there\u2019s a difference in Obama\u2019s approach to accommodate the difference in how most Americans regard foreign policy issues. Frustrating as it may be for those of us who focus our energies on foreign policy and defense, most Americans don\u2019t regard those issues important unless there\u2019s a crisis and even then, unless America is involved in a war, people don\u2019t think much about them.\n\nObama\u2019s foreign policy has two goals. First, Obama disdains the use of American power. Not just military power but diplomatic and international power as well. His policy is dedicated to eliminating any action that is undertaken because America\u2019s interests demand it. His aim is to reduce America from a superpower to something less. He\u2019s succeeding.\n\nSecond, Obama\u2019s policy is aimed at creating issues \u2014 not solutions \u2014 among our allies, dividing them from us and among themselves just as he divides Americans by blaming Republicans for lacking solutions to problems. He has divorced Israel and gone along with France when it wanted military action against Libya and again when it sells warships to Russia while Russia is using a proxy force to conquer Ukraine. Any foreign policy divisions he can create among Americans is a collateral benefit, nothing more. They can be considerable, as the border crisis proves.\n\nObama doesn\u2019t want to solve the border crisis. He wants to use executive power to grant illegal aliens legal status without congressional action. He\u2019s content to go without congressional funding of his multi-billion dollar ploy to aid illegal immigrant \u201cprocessing\u201d if he can also ignore funding for Iron Dome. He has no problem with Harry Reid coupling the two and demanding more on amnesty as a price for passing a bill containing all of those items.\n\nJoint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey compared Russia\u2019s action in the Ukraine to Stalin\u2019s invasion of Poland in 1939 when the Soviet Union was Hitler\u2019s ally. He said, \u201cYou\u2019ve got a Russian government that has made a conscious decision to use its military force inside another sovereign nation to achieve its objectives. It\u2019s the first time since 1939 or so that that\u2019s been the case.\u2026 They clearly are on a path to assert themselves differently not just in Eastern Europe, but Europe in the main, and towards the United States.\u201d\n\nIf Dempsey and Poroshenko mistake Obama for someone who actually wants a solution to the Russian invasion of Ukraine that would leave it free and democratic, they mistake Obama for someone he is not.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 1742097289343962}, "generator": "WordPress 4.4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca8d9\"", "article_summary": "The long list of actions President Obama should take to resolve many crises around the world describes many that are \u2014 or at least were before Obama \u2014 in America\u2019s interests and within America\u2019s grasp.\nWhat he said made a lot of sense, but it struck me that we all know that President Obama will do absolutely nothing he recommended.\nNow, when the opportunity presents itself, Obama is doing almost the same thing on foreign policy.\nWe can take it to the bank that Obama will do none of these things.\nI say almost, not exactly, because there\u2019s a difference in Obama\u2019s approach to accommodate the difference in how most Americans regard foreign policy issues."}
