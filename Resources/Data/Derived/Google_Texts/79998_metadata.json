Seven IRS staffers all understand investigation have computer crashes and there\u2019s no way to get the missing data back, a coincidence,\u201d he said. \u201cRight. According to Rhonda Knehans Drake, assistant professor at New York University the odds of these seven drives crashing is 1 in 3.1 million. Add to the probability the probability of not being able to retrieve the data from each one and the odds are approaching that of you alone being hit by a meteor.\u201d\n\n\u201cA coincidence, Mr. Obama?\u201d Gutfeld continued. \u201cDon\u2019t paint a turd orange and tell me it\u2019s sherbet. Coincidences are nothing more than order masked as chaos. Truly this administration is a mess but it\u2019s a mess choreographed like a Broadway musical. They knew what they were doing and they knew the media wouldn\u2019t mind. Calling it random is a slap in the face of the American public. Add that smirking commissioner and you have a gateway to war because once you lowered the bar this far for corruption, you invite blowback that will be far worse.\u201d\n\n\u201cImagine dear liberals if the next president is the kind you hate and imagine him coupling with coercion,\u201d he added. \u201cMovements begin not from anger but from desperation when a cover-up is so blatant and the press shelves their spines in service to their kings. You make the unlikely likely, the average citizen doing your job in the street. So the first step admit to cover-up one that makes a burka look like a bikini. And do it soon or the next response will make the Tea Party look like a tea party.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Gutfeld to Obama on IRS Missing Emails: 'Don't Paint a Turd Orange and Tell Me It's Sherbet'", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Gutfeld to Obama on IRS Missing Emails: 'Don't Paint a Turd Orange and Tell Me It's Sherbet'", "title": "Gutfeld to Obama on IRS Missing Emails: 'Don't Paint a Turd Orange and Tell Me It's Sherbet' - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Breitbart-TV/2014/06/25/Gutfeld625a.jpg", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/video/2014/06/25/gutfeld-to-obama-on-irs-missing-emails-dont-paint-a-turd-orange-and-tell-me-its-sherbet/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Gutfeld to Obama on IRS Missing Emails: 'Don't Paint a Turd Orange and Tell Me It's Sherbet'", "title": "Gutfeld to Obama on IRS Missing Emails: 'Don't Paint a Turd Orange and Tell Me It's Sherbet' - Breitbart", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Breitbart-TV/2014/06/25/Gutfeld625a.jpg", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Greg Gutfeld, Twitter, White House,Breitbart TV,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Breitbart TV", "tag": "White House", "published_time": "2014-06-25T16:34:00-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart TV"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd720e\"", "article_summary": "And do it soon or the next response will make the Tea Party look like a tea party.\u201d\nSeven IRS staffers all understand investigation have computer crashes and there\u2019s no way to get the missing data back, a coincidence,\u201d he said.\n\u201cDon\u2019t paint a turd orange and tell me it\u2019s sherbet.\nGutfeld honed in specifically on the missing email aspect of the situation and warned there could consequences if the Obama White House fails to admit a cover-up.\nAccording to Rhonda Knehans Drake, assistant professor at New York University the odds of these seven drives crashing is 1 in 3.1 million."}
