Stephen A. Smith, the ESPN host notorious for saying very smart things about domestic violence and about Roger Goodell, raised eyebrows last week after suggesting that all African-Americans vote Republican for one election cycle, just to prove to Democrats that the party doesn’t have Black America “under their thumb.” Never one to back down from a controversial statement, Smith doubled down on his comments on CNN over the weekend, telling host Michael Smerconish the black community has been instrumental in its own underrepresentation.

“I definitely believe the Black vote has been taken for granted, and primarily the black community is at fault for that in my estimation,” Smith said. “On one hand, we’re giving one party our vote because they’ve successfully gone about the business of convincing our community that the other party, the Republican party, is completely against the interests of the black community.”

The ESPN host went on to say that this results in Democrats feeling they have “license to take us for granted, [and] Republicans have a license to summarily dismiss us because they believe they’ll never get our vote anyway … and then we find ourselves devoid of any kind of representation whatsoever because nobody is really competing to garner our vote and our support.”
