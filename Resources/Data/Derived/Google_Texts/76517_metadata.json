The spots also helped Ernst win support from prominent Republicans, including New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida. The woman who branded herself a \"mother, soldier, leader\u201d convinced Republicans she was the party's best chance to turn red a Senate seat held by retiring Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin.\n\nWhile Ernst propelled herself to victory by painting herself as a Midwestern woman who grew up on a farm, Democrats pointed to questionable statements to claim she's a hard-right conservative, if not a conspiracy theorist.\n\nAgenda 21\n\nWhile campaigning last November, Ernst backed a right-wing theory that the United Nations' sustainable development plan Agenda 21 is a conspiracy that would enable the government to strip Americans of their freedom and eliminate private property rights.\n\nAll of us agreed that Agenda 21 is a horrible idea. One of those implications to Americans, again, going back to what did it does do to the individual family here in the state of Iowa, and what I've seen, the implications that it has here is moving people off of their agricultural land and consolidating them into city centers, and then telling them that you don't have property rights anymore. These are all things that the UN is behind, and it's bad for the United States and bad for families here in the state of Iowa.\n\nStates Can Nullify Federal Laws\n\nAt a forum held by Iowa's Faith & Freedom Coalition in July, Ernst suggested that states can somehow nullify laws passed by the federal government.\n\nYou know we have talked about this at the state legislature before, nullification. But, bottom line is, as U.S. senator, why should we be passing laws that the states are considering nullifying? Bottom line: our legislators at the federal level should not be passing those laws. We\u2019re right ... we\u2019ve gone 200-plus years of federal legislators going against the 10th Amendment\u2019s states\u2019 rights. We are way overstepping bounds as federal legislators. So, bottom line, no we should not be passing laws as federal legislators -- as senators or congressman -- that the states would even consider nullifying. Bottom line.\n\nWMDs In Iraq\n\nErnst told the Des Moines Register's editorial board in May that she believed there were weapons of mass destruction found during the United States' invasion of Iraq. From the Daily Beast:\n\n\"We don't know that there were weapons on the ground when we went in,\" she said, \"however, I do have reason to believe there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.\" When a Register reporter quizzed her on what information she has, Ernst said, \"My husband served in Saudi Arabia as the Army Central Command sergeant major for a year and that's a hot-button topic in that area.\"\n\nErnst later clarified those comments in a statement conceding that there were no WMDs in Iraq, although the country had used them before.\n\n47 Percent Mentality\n\nAudio recorded by Radio Iowa in 2013 revealed that Ernst, like many conservatives, holds a \"makers vs. takers\" view toward social welfare programs. But as Greg Sargent reported, her comments went further than former GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney's infamous \"47 percent\" video.\n\nWe\u2019re looking at Obamacare right now. Once we start with those benefits in January, how are we going to get people off of those? It\u2019s exponentially harder to remove people once they\u2019ve already been on those programs ... we rely on government for absolutely everything. And in the years since I was a small girl up until now into my adulthood with children of my own, we have lost a reliance on not only our own families, but so much of what our churches and private organizations used to do. They used to have wonderful food pantries. They used to provide clothing for those that really needed it. But we have gotten away from that. Now we\u2019re at a point where the government will just give away anything.\n\nClimate Change Skeptic\n\nWhile hardly unique among Republicans, Ernst has claimed she does not possess the scientific knowhow to weigh in on whether humans are causing climate change. But she did chalk it up to \"cyclic changes in the weather\" during an interview in May.\n\nYes, we do see climates change, but I have not seen proven proof that it is entirely man-made. I think we do have cyclic changes in weather, and I think that's been throughout the course of history. What impact is man-made. ... but I do think we can educate people to make good choices.\n\nShe Really Likes Her Gun\n\nAn ad featuring Ernst shooting at a target that is supposed to represent the federal government isn't the first time she has used such a stark metaphor. Speaking at a 2012 NRA event, Ernst said her firearm would help protect her if the government imposes on her rights.\n\nI have a beautiful little Smith & Wesson, 9 millimeter, and it goes with me virtually everywhere. But I do believe in the right to carry, and I believe in the right to defend myself and my family -- whether it\u2019s from an intruder, or whether it\u2019s from the government, should they decide that my rights are no longer important.", "article_metadata": {"description": "WASHINGTON -- Voters in Iowa elected Republican Joni Ernst to the U.S. Senate on Tuesday, making her the state's first woman senator.\n\nErnst, a state s...", "sailthru.expire_date": "2014-11-06 09:00:25 -0500", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "WASHINGTON -- Voters in Iowa elected Republican Joni Ernst to the U.S. Senate on Tuesday, making her the state's first woman senator.\n\nErnst, a state s...", "title": "Here Are Some Things That Soon-To-Be Iowa Senator Joni Ernst Actually Said", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/11/05/joni-ernst-conspiracies_n_6104820.html", "image": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2244650/images/o-JONI-ERNST-facebook.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "WASHINGTON -- Voters in Iowa elected Republican Joni Ernst to the U.S. Senate on Tuesday, making her the state's first woman senator.\n\nErnst, a state s...", "title": "Here Are Some Things That Soon-To-Be Iowa Senator Joni Ernst Actually Said", "image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2244650/images/o-JONI-ERNST-facebook.jpg", "height": 1000}, "creator": "SabrinaSiddiqui", "site": "@HuffPostPol", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-11-05 09:00:25 -0500", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=6104820", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "iowa senate race,iowa senate 2014,Iowa senate,iowa senate race 2014,joni ernst,joni ernst senate,joni ernst 2014,joni ernst iowa,joni ernst bruce braley,iowa joni ernst,Bruce Braley,elections 2014,2014 election,2014 elections,2014 midterm elections,midterm election results,Politics News,video", "article": {"section": "Politics", "tag": "iowa senate race,iowa senate 2014,Iowa senate,iowa senate race 2014,joni ernst,joni ernst senate,joni ernst 2014,joni ernst iowa,joni ernst bruce braley,iowa joni ernst,Bruce Braley,elections 2014,2014 election,2014 elections,2014 midterm elections,midterm election results,Politics News,video", "published_time": "2014-11-05 09:00:25 -0500", "modified_time": "2014-11-14 17:59:02 -0500"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf78c\"", "article_summary": "WASHINGTON -- Voters in Iowa elected Republican Joni Ernst to the U.S. Senate on Tuesday, making her the state's first woman senator.\nWe are way overstepping bounds as federal legislators.\nThese are all things that the UN is behind, and it's bad for the United States and bad for families here in the state of Iowa.\nWe\u2019re right ... we\u2019ve gone 200-plus years of federal legislators going against the 10th Amendment\u2019s states\u2019 rights.\nSo, bottom line, no we should not be passing laws as federal legislators -- as senators or congressman -- that the states would even consider nullifying."}
