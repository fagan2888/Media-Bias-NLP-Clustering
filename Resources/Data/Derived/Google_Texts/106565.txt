Log Cabin Republicans, an advocacy group for gay conservatives and allies, is ripping a new Obamacare video ad that it says employs homosexual stereotypes to persuade gay men to enroll in Obamacare.

The ad from Out2Enroll — an Obamacare LGBT outreach group — depicts well-toned shirtless men in tight bathing trunks dancing, hugging, opening presents, and enrolling on the Obamacare website. There is one woman with the men in a few shots and a female singer, but they’re far from the focus.

Significantly the Log Cabin Republicans’ executive director noted: “If anyone on the right made such a comparison, liberals would be apoplectic.”

Gregory T. Angelo even invoked the “Duck Dynasty” controversy.

“At a time when left-wing propagandists are decrying Duck Dynasty‘s Phil Robertson for equating homosexuality with promiscuity and deviance, Out2Enroll and others should take a look in the mirror and ask if the truth is that they are the ones responsible for promoting such harmful stereotypes,” he said in Sunday’s statement.

Angelo said the ad is an example of the left “promoting harmful stereotypes that gay men are nothing more than sex-crazed lechers.”

“This cynical ad betrays the depths Obamacare advocates will sink to in order to pad their pathetic enrollment numbers,” Angelo added.

“As a self-proclaimed ‘fierce advocate’ of gay equality, President Obama would do well to distance himself from this nonsense and denounce it immediately.”

Out2Enroll posted the ad on YouTube last week and calls it a holiday parody aimed at bringing awareness to Obamacare enrollment, The Hill said.
