WellCare currently has greater presence in Florida, Georgia and Kentucky.\n\nLast month, Anthem Inc said it would buy Cigna Corp and Aetna Inc announced the acquisition of Humana Inc.\n\nThe deals could present acquisition opportunities for WellCare and rival Centene Corp as Anthem and Aetna might have to sell some Medicare Advantage plans to satisfy antitrust regulators.\n\nCentene, which has said it was looking to buy Medicare Advantage plans, is also acquiring Health Net Inc for $6.3 billion to scale up its government plans business.\n\nWellCare raised its adjusted earnings forecast for 2015 to $3.30-$3.45 per share from $3.15-$3.40.\n\nMemberships in the company's Medicaid plans, which offer government-sponsored insurance to low-income families, rose 10.8 percent to 2.4 million in the second quarter. Adjusted medical benefits ratio, the share of premium WellCare spends on claims, improved to 88.8 percent from 93.5 percent in the business.\n\nWellCare reported net income of $51.7 million, or $1.17 per share, for the quarter ended June 30 compared with a loss of $7.5 million, or 17 cents per share, a year earlier.\n\nExcluding items, the company earned $1.34 per share.\n\nRevenue rose 10.5 percent to $3.48 billion.\n\nAnalysts on average had expected a profit of 96 cents per share and revenue of $3.45 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\n\nWellCare's shares were up 8.6 percent at $86.99 in late morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Up to Tuesday's close, the stock had risen 33 percent in the past 12 months.
