Max Baucus, D-Mont., questions Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius as she testifies on Capitol Hill in Washington.

Scott Applewhite, File)\n\n4267666\n\nYet another newly unearthed video shows a leading Obamacare architect suggesting that the health insurance subsidies were meant only for customer in state-run exchanges.\n\nThis time its former Democratic Senator Max Baucus, who introduced the Affordable Care Act and whose staff primarily authored the original bill. PJ Media\u2019s Instapundit found a video of Sen. Baucus discussing the Senate Finance Committeee\u2019s jurisdiction over state health care policy back in 2009 (watch the video here).\n\nWhen former Republican Sen. John Ensign pressed Baucus on a proposed amendment that would insert medical malpractice reforms into the Affordable Care Act, Baucus seems to have suggested that the Senate\u2019s foray into state health care policy was allowable because the bill would allow states to opt into building their own exchanges.\n\n\u201cHow do we have jurisdiction over changing state laws on coverage?\u201d Ensign asked when Baucus protested that medical malpractice was outside the jurisdiction of the Senate. \u201cOutside of Medicare, or Medicaid?\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are conditions to participate in the exchange. We\u2019re setting up an exchange,\u201d Baucus replied. \u201cAnd states, exchanges, essentially it\u2019s tax credits.\u201d\n\nWhile Ensign\u2019s medical malpractice amendment didn\u2019t make it into the law, Baucus\u2019s comments provide even more evidence that years ago, Obamacare\u2019s authors believed that providing premium subsidies only to state exchanges would be the incentive they needed to get red states to create their own health care exchanges.\n\nWhile one appeals court found subsidies in federal exchanges to be against the text of the health care law earlier this week, a second appeals court found federal subsidies lawful, partially due to their interpretation of Congressional intent. The video of Baucus publicly stating that subsidies were the carrot for states to build exchanges may influence the next court decision on the case.\n\nThe evidence against federal exchange subsidies is quickly piling up. A chief architect of the health care law, MIT economist Jonathan Gruber, made similar arguments in two recordings unearthed by bloggers Friday.
