In Boulder, caring for homeless animals has spanned a century and benefits those who volunteer, as well.\n\nDebbie Hopkins, an HSBV volunteer, plays with three kittens in her home.

Several well-meaning individuals advocated kindness towards animals, but the organization got off to a slow start.\n\nThirty years later, the Humane Society was revived after a $50,000 endowment from a wealthy pet owner. In 1935, Morris, who never drew a salary, opened the doors of Boulder's first animal shelter on the north side of Arapahoe Avenue on land now occupied by the Riverbend Office Park.\n\nThere, the middle-aged woman welcomed homeless cats and dogs, loved and tended to their needs, then offered them for adoption. She also boarded animals (including cattle and horses) by the day, week or month.\n\nAt the time, Morris wrote that the shelter aided in what she called humane education. For the first time, she said, children (and adults) had a place to bring homeless cats and litters of kittens found in yards and alleys.\n\nToday, volunteers carry on the framework set in place by Morris 80 years ago.\n\nOne such volunteer is Debbie Hopkins. A science writer who works from her Boulder home, Hopkins has found her house the perfect place to foster kittens.\n\nDuring the past five years, she has cared for dozens of kittens and cats before they were made available for adoption from the HSBV, now located at 2323 55th St.\n\nOther volunteers take in puppies and dogs. Sometimes a mature cat or dog does best in a quiet place when recovering from surgery or an injury.\n\nKittens and puppies, however, often can use some socialization while putting on weight before being spayed or neutered.\n\nHopkins and the others have found that animals initially cared for in private residences learn, at very young ages, to adapt to children, other pets and the hustle and bustle of busy households.\n\nAccording to Lindsay Scott, volunteer services manager for the HSBV, the Humane Society wouldn't be able to exist without its volunteers. In addition to fostering, volunteers work in the shelter, clinic, and training center, and they raise funds through society-sponsored fundraisers, special events and a thrift shop.\n\nAs the shelter's founder, Morris explained in her writings that by caring for animals, both children and adults learn empathy, a concept that Hopkins has noticed when watching her own children interact with the household's turnover of visitors.\n\nAsked why she volunteers, Hopkins said, \"My family always gets more back in love from the cats and kittens and the reward of knowing they've gotten a second chance and forever home.\"\n\nMorris would have agreed.\n\nSilvia Pettem and Carol Taylor write about history for the Daily Camera.
