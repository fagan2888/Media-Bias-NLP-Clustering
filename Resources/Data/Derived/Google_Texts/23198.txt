A bunch of people on Twitter have noticed a problem with Jeb Bush’s set design for his big speech on health care.

Bush delivered the speech today in New Hampshire, laying out his vision of repealing the Affordable Care Act, and detailing how he would propose to replace it in a way that would not leave people without access to care.

Jeb spoke with a backdrop of a slogan, rendered as follows:

Lower Costs

Innovate

End Obamacare

Do you see the the problem?

If you look closely at @JebBush‘s health care plan, he’s really up front about how terrible it is. pic.twitter.com/BUTINC4A1j — Matt Ortega (@MattOrtega) October 13, 2015

Also note that with the slogan repeated over and over again on the backdrop, the resulting acrostic can be seen surrounding Jeb from all sides.
