They tell 11 News that Beki's case has been assigned a new detective, and they hope that fresh eyes on the case will mean fresh leads.\n\nHer father Agim Elshani says that it's something that he struggles with every day. Agim Elshani/Beki's Father: \"People think we are normal, we are going on with our lives. They don't know what's in our minds.\"\n\nHe says their minds are full of questions about what happened to Beki, and where her body is now. None of them believe that she is still alive.\n\nBeki's boyfriend at the time killed himself just days after she disappeared. Her family believes that he killed her and left her body somewhere in the mountains.\n\nThey searched the areas where her boyfriend's cell phone showed activity the night she vanished, but found nothing.\n\nThey say they just want to bring her remains home and bury her, so they have a place to mourn her loss properly.\n\nElshani: \"At least we go to her grave and bring flowers.\"\n\nBeki's family says that they have not met with the new detective in the case yet, but they hope to soon.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "Seven years ago, 22-year-old Beki Elshani disappeared, now her family is offering a $5,000 reward for information leading to the discovery of her remains.", "language": "english", "author": "KKTV 11 News", "og": {"description": "Seven years ago, 22-year-old Beki Elshani disappeared, now her family is offering a $5,000 reward for information leading to the discovery of her remains.", "title": "Missing Woman's Family Offering Reward, Seven Years After Disappearance", "url": "http://www.kktv.com/home/headlines/Missing-Womans-Family-Offering-Reward-Seven-Years-After-Disappearance-297962641.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/AA7/180/AA7180C5AD03433ABE844A85CCB06455", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/FF1/124/FF11246716AB4EB78522ABE6B4485D52.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kktv.com", "description": "Seven years ago, 22-year-old Beki Elshani disappeared, now her family is offering a $5,000 reward for information leading to the discovery of her remains.", "creator": "@kktv11news", "url": "http://www.kktv.com/home/headlines/Missing-Womans-Family-Offering-Reward-Seven-Years-After-Disappearance-297962641.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/Beki+Elshani.JPG", "title": "Missing Woman's Family Offering Reward, Seven Years After Disappearance", "site": "@kktv11news", "card": "summary"}, "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Missing Woman's Family Offering Reward, Seven Years After Disappearance", "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "google-site-verification": "gUw-UdhXT7u-BunNWfQWA_t3azu7BEGubOcNT6HddJQ", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Missing Womans Family Offering Reward"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb14a\"", "article_summary": "Seven years ago, 22-year-old Beki Elshani disappeared, now her family is offering a $5,000 reward for information leading to the discovery of her remains.\nHer family held a memorial service Saturday evening to mark seven years since she was last seen.\nBeki's family says that they have not met with the new detective in the case yet, but they hope to soon.\nThey tell 11 News that Beki's case has been assigned a new detective, and they hope that fresh eyes on the case will mean fresh leads.\nHer father Agim Elshani says that it's something that he struggles with every day."}
