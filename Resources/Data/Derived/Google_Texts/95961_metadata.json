With the national debt now at roughly $17 trillion and regulations in place that are crippling economic development, Perkins believes voters in 2014 will be ready for change.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cBorrowing 40 cents on every dollar spent by the federal government is the wrong direction for the country to take and contrary to the core principles of the Founding Fathers,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat is happening in D.C. right now is an example of why our Founders wanted a very limited central government.\u201d\n\nAs a result of not following the constitutional framework set up by the Founders, Perkins said all three branches of the federal government now regularly overstep their boundaries. This overreach results in the imposition of unfunded mandates on states and creates enough uncertainty to keep businesses from expanding and creating more jobs.\n\n\u201cPeople are tired of career politicians \u2013 they want someone who is honest, genuine and lives in the real world,\u201d said Perkins. \u201cThere needs to be more people in the Senate with backbone who are willing to say, \u2018This is outside of what the federal government is supposed to be doing.\u2019\u201d\n\nShe is Merkley\u2019s first challenger for the 2014 election. The Democrat took office in 2008 after beating Republican Gordon Smith, who served two terms in the Senate.\n\nOn Wednesday, Perkins visited The Dalles to meet with GOP leaders and learn what concerns the community has that can be addressed at the federal level. She lives in Albany with husband, George, a self-employed carpet installer, but has been on the road almost constantly in recent weeks to learn more about issues that are unique to local and regional economies.\n\n\u201cI am hearing over and over that we need to get back to basics,\u201d she said.\n\nPerkins is a noticeable figure in her yellow campaign Corvette and hopes that people will approach her during stops to share their concerns.\n\nShe recently graduated from Oregon State University with a bachelor\u2019s degree in political science, setting her up to pursue a long time interest in public service.\n\n\u201cI have always loved politics and wanted to run for an office,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t believe in working my way up the ladder so I am going for a federal office because that\u2019s where I feel that I can make the most difference.\u201d\n\nBefore returning to college, she worked as a financial planner and advisor, as well as in real estate.\n\n\n\nPerkins doesn\u2019t plan to give Merkley her \u201cplaybook\u201d yet by unveiling details about her platform on energy, foreign policy and other national and international issues. She said this early in the race, her time will be spent doing more listening than talking.\n\nShe did say during a Sept. 4 interview that she believes the free market, not the federal government, should determine much of the nation\u2019s direction on energy policies. She also does not believe in Congress picking \u201cwinner and losers\u201d by the allocation of subsidies.\n\nShe is a strong supporter of the Constitution\u2019s Second Amendment, which protects gun ownership rights, and the Fourth Amendment, which offers protections against illegal searches and seizures.\n\nAn indicator of her future platform can be found in Perkins\u2019 signing on to the \u201cContract with America,\u201d an agenda of conservative proposals that, among other things, encourages senators and representatives to make sure every new law adheres to the Constitution. The contract also seeks to simplify the federal tax system and replaces the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, with something less burdensome and expensive.\n\n\u201cI am making a promise to voters that I will read every bill before I vote for it,\u201d said Perkins in reference to several bills introduced under Democratic leadership that have been more than 1,000 pages and unveiled only hours before the vote took place.\n\nAny bill that she is expected to support must be free of \u201cpork barrel\u201d spending for unrelated projects \u2013 Perkins is adamant on that point.\n\n\u201cEvery spending measure needs to stand on its own,\u201d she said.\n\nWith Oregon a \u201cblue\u201d state that leans toward liberal candidates and Merkley an incumbent, Perkins acknowledges she has a big hill to climb to capture his Senate seat.\n\n\u201cHow do you climb a big hill? One step at a time,\u201d she said of spending the next year on the campaign trail.\n\nShe said it is interesting to note that Merkley repeatedly says at town halls and other public functions that he is \u201cconsidering\u201d proposing one bill or another to address a problematic issue.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been in office for five years, what is he waiting for?\u201d she asked. \u201cIt sounds good to say that when you are out campaigning but we are no better off than when he took office \u2014 in many ways we are in a worse place.\u201d\n\nIt is time, said Perkins, to send people to the nation\u2019s capital who will stand their ground and not cave to pressure from \u201cestablishment politicians.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is time for real change,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cYou have to honor and respect them for their years of service but there is a reason the Founders didn\u2019t believe people should spend their life in service,\u201d she said.\n\nPerkins said she will serve only 12 years in the role of Senate before following the lead of the Founders and returning to her regular life. She and George have two grown children, ages 32 and 33, and five grandchildren, with a sixth on the way, so there will be plenty to do when she is not needed in D.C.", "article_metadata": {"msvalidate.01": "6F0F769B18C1F1E5145E5D36120FA2DD", "google-site-verification": "dr1NYOQ7L4IbMMoa9sXvO5M_zmQUi6VBoRGJSuF4BSg", "og": {"url": "http://www.thedalleschronicle.com/news/2013/sep/06/perkins-wants-senate-reform/", "type": "article", "title": "Perkins wants Senate reform"}, "viewport": "width=1020", "description": "Borrowing is \u2018crippling\u2019, candidate says\r\n\r\nJo Rae Perkins wants to take Jeff Merkley\u2019s seat in the U.S. Senate to help regain control of a federal government that is usurping states\u2019 rights and bankrupting the nation."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8b2d\"", "article_summary": "The Democrat took office in 2008 after beating Republican Gordon Smith, who served two terms in the Senate.\n\u0097 Jo Rae Perkins wants to take Jeff Merkley\u2019s seat in the U.S. Senate to help regain control of a federal government that is usurping states\u2019 rights and bankrupting the nation.\n\u201cPeople are tired of career politicians \u2013 they want someone who is honest, genuine and lives in the real world,\u201d said Perkins.\nPerkins said she will serve only 12 years in the role of Senate before following the lead of the Founders and returning to her regular life.\nWith Oregon a \u201cblue\u201d state that leans toward liberal candidates and Merkley an incumbent, Perkins acknowledges she has a big hill to climb to capture his Senate seat."}
