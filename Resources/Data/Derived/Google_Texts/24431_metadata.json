Hooray! Sweet Mother Nature is breathing new life into trees that were barren and birdless just a few weeks ago. And what, Dear Reader, is your part in this joyful blossoming? It\u2019s rejoicing in your own human nature \u2014 knowing that when the seasons shift and change, so can you. Spring is the time for fresh starts and new beginnings, especially when it comes to living a healthier lifestyle.\n\nLike plants to the light, we all desire more energy, more growth and greater productivity.\n\nBut how do we get there?\n\nDr. Elson Haas\u2019s timeless book, \u201cStaying Healthy with the Seasons,\u201d is a great source of inspiration.\n\n\u201cThe beginning of spring is March 21st, the time of the spring equinox, when day equals night,\u201d he writes. \u201cFor the next six months daylight, the sun and yang principle, will be dominating our lives.\n\n\u201cYou may now feel a new spark and power, and be filled with inspiration and energy to act upon your ideas.\u201d\n\n(Yes, this sounds like something you\u2019d find inside a fortune cookie, but never mind. There\u2019s good stuff here.) \u201c(Spring) is the time for planting,\u201d Haas reminds us. \u201cNew growth in our lives, relationships, and work is stimulated now as well. We and nature will flourish this season.\u201d\n\nSo let me plant a few seeds to help you flourish this spring and inspire your own new growth:\n\nLet nature nurture: Knowing that spring is the perfect time for new beginnings is one thing. Experiencing it is another. Take an hour or a day this week to reconnect to nature, in all her season-changing glory.\n\nSpend some quiet time at a park, a lake or in a garden. Notice everything around you. Breathe.\n\nThink about one change that would make you feel more alive, ease your stress, add to your happiness.\n\nWrite down just one goal as a way of marking the moment. When you tap into nature and seasonal change, you tap into something bigger than yourself. That connection will help you make lifestyle changes that last.\n\nStart a journal: Don\u2019t question why a springtime fitness journal is sacrosanct. Just do it! Make an entry every day, based on the goal you wrote down after your commune with nature.\n\nDon\u2019t judge, don\u2019t censor. Simply keep track of the day and anything else that relates to achieving your goal, including your feelings, your successes.\n\nRead it over in 3 months, just before summer begins. When you see how far you\u2019ve come, you\u2019ll keep going.\n\nCrank it up a notch: This spring, decide to strengthen your connection to your favorite physical activity. If it\u2019s running, work with a trainer, try some new terrain or add interval training to your routine. If it\u2019s dancing, learn some new steps or switch from salsa to tango.\n\nIf you don\u2019t have a favorite physical activity \u2014 What? \u2014 please find one!\n\nIf nothing else thrills you, I invite you to find a great yoga teacher and move into it, slowly and deeply. Give yourself three months of just showing up. For sure your sap will rise.\n\nSpring clean your eating habits: Let the spring of 2016 be the season you shift away from old patterns of eating that make you unhealthy, unhappy and overweight.\n\nNo gimmicks, no fads, no aping the latest trend to go Paleo. Find your own path, according to your own biochem-istry, your own nutritional needs. Give yourself permission to stop dieting, now and forever. Instead, focus on eating tasty real food.\n\nFor sure, do a springtime kitchen makeover. If you\u2019re reading this, you can read labels. Get rid of processed food-like items with long list of suspect ingredients. Eat clean. You can! You must! You will!\n\nI like to call it the song of the robin.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2016/03/1005209662-FL_SAR_HFFITCOL2.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "article_summary": "\u201cThe beginning of spring is March 21st, the time of the spring equinox, when day equals night,\u201d he writes.\nSpring clean your eating habits: Let the spring of 2016 be the season you shift away from old patterns of eating that make you unhealthy, unhappy and overweight.\nWhen you tap into nature and seasonal change, you tap into something bigger than yourself.\nSpring is the time for fresh starts and new beginnings, especially when it comes to living a healthier lifestyle.\nIt\u2019s rejoicing in your own human nature \u2014 knowing that when the seasons shift and change, so can you."}
