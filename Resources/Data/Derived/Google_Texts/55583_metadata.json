He stood with Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas last year when the federal government closed and again this month when they tried to take on President Barack Obama on immigration but ended up giving Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada leverage to confirm controversial nominations.\n\nSo as Lee fights to make sure he doesn\u2019t become the first tea party senator ousted by the party establishment, he\u2019s effectively turned the Republican intraparty war that has defined Senate primary politics for the past four years on its head.\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019m going to be OK,\u201d Lee said when asked about lingering concerns about his performance in Congress in corners of Utah\u2019s business world.\n\nLee has made significant headway in some Utah establishment quarters \u2014 but threats are lingering.\n\nHuntsman, who founded the petrochemical giant that bears his name, refuses to meet with Lee because of his \u201cextremely radical\u201d positions and is considering putting his political and financial muscle behind a primary challenger.\n\nScott Anderson, a prominent bank president in Salt Lake City, has privately commissioned polls to assess Lee\u2019s race while meeting with some of his prospective foes to gauge their interest.\n\nAnd one former state GOP party chairman, Thomas Wright, is actively considering a bid against the Utah freshman, while others in the business world are keeping the door open about a prospective bid.\n\n\u201cAll I can say is Mike Lee is an embarrassment to the state of Utah,\u201d Huntsman said in an interview, calling Lee \u201can extremist\u201d for his role in the government shutdown fight that he said cost his cancer research institute millions in federal dollars and hurt small businesses affected by the closure of national parks. \u201cHe\u2019s been a tremendous embarrassment to our family, to our state, to our country to have him as a U.S. senator.\u201d\n\nHuntsman, who has longstanding ties to Lee\u2019s family, added: \u201cHe\u2019s tried to come in and see me several times. \u2026 I have no interest whatsoever in chatting with him.\u201d\n\nAsked if he had a response to Huntsman, Lee simply said: \u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nWhat is happening in Utah marks a new chapter in the tea-party-vs.-establishment wars that have defined Republican politics since 2010. At that time, Lee seized on conservatives\u2019 frustration with a veteran GOP senator, Bob Bennett, to win the party\u2019s nomination and emerge as one of the country\u2019s most prominent tea party senators. But after four years in Washington, where he\u2019s aligned himself with the most conservative wing of the party, some Republicans are weighing whether there\u2019s an opening to challenge Lee now as an insurgent bankrolled by the establishment \u2014 or whether they should wait until 2018, if veteran Sen. Orrin Hatch carries through on his pledge to retire.\n\nIn an interview, the 80-year-old Hatch said the current term would be his last \u201cunless something very serious happened where I had to go forward.\u201d Hatch, who said he \u201cprobably\u201d will back Lee, said \u201cit\u2019s a little too early to make any judgments\u201d on whether his junior colleague will have a serious fight on his hand.\n\nSince last year\u2019s shutdown, Lee\u2019s poll numbers have rebounded while he remains beloved by the tea party right. In the meantime, his courtship of business and political leaders has paid some dividends, including winning the backing of another executive of a Salt Lake City bank and aggressively promoting his \u201cconservative reform agenda\u201d on issues ranging from tax reform to housing policy. He has held scores of townhall meetings and let voters air their grievances while detailing why he took his infamous stand with Cruz to defund Obamacare, a fight that led to the 16-day shutdown last year.\n\nBut his team knows full well that winning over the party establishment will be critical to heading off the prospects of a primary challenger.\n\n\u201cSen. Lee\u2019s biggest challenge politically has been a lack of a developed narrative for the establishment,\u201d said Lee\u2019s campaign chairman, Bud Scruggs, a veteran Republican operative with deep ties to insiders in Utah. Scruggs has attended at least two dozen meetings with the senator and business leaders over the past year. \u201cI think the narrative is simply this: If you believe the country is headed in the right direction, you probably are never going to be an enthusiastic supporter of Sen. Lee. If you believe it\u2019s headed in the wrong direction, then you need leadership in Washington, D.C., that has real reforms and real changes in mind.\u201d\n\nFor now, Lee has reasons to be confident. He has a deeply enthusiastic base of thousands of conservative activists who dominate the party\u2019s nominating convention, though prospective changes in the primary process could lessen their influence. Conservative groups like the Senate Conservatives Fund and Club for Growth are backing him, as is the main GOP establishment group, the National Republican Senatorial Committee.\n\n\u201cWe are 100 percent committed to getting Sen. Lee reelected,\u201d said Mississippi Sen. Roger Wicker, the new chairman of the NRSC. \u201cI think his chances are very, very good.\u201d\n\nA Brigham Young University poll this month showed Lee\u2019s favorability rating at 52 percent \u2014 12 points higher than during the government shutdown last year, while the Club for Growth, SCF and the Madison Project released a poll last week that showed the Utah freshman in an even stronger position with primary voters.\n\nBut in the BYU poll, just 32 percent of Utah voters believed that Republicans \u201cshould stand up to\u201d Obama if it means that less work will get accomplished, while 66 percent called for more consensus building even if GOP groups are disappointed. That kind of message could create an opening for a prospective opponent.\n\n\u201cBusiness leaders who are successful learn to compromise and move forward as necessary,\u201d said Lane Beattie, the president and CEO of the Salt Lake Chamber of Commerce, who said he has had \u201cstrong encouragement\u201d from the business world to run against Lee. \u201cStrictly speaking on behalf of businesses, the frustration is when you have people who refuse \u2026 to work together to come up with solutions that can move us forward.\u201d\n\nA former state Senate president, Beattie said he\u2019s not taking any steps toward running against Lee and would evaluate what happens in the new Congress before making any decisions. As part of his outreach, Lee has met regularly with Beattie and local Chamber officials, with Beattie saying he\u2019s \u201cconfident\u201d the senator is trying to do what\u2019s best for the country.\n\n\u201cI believe that Mike Lee is extremely principled,\u201d Beattie said. \u201cBut he has to, from a legislative standpoint in Congress, learn what it takes to make a change \u2014 make a difference. You can try all the bills in the world, but if you don\u2019t get anything done, what\u2019s the purpose unless you are influencing someone?\u201d\n\nTo address that concern, Lee has joined forces with Democrats occasionally through his time in office, including with New York Sen. Chuck Schumer on a housing bill and with Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin on a bill to update nonviolent drug sentencing laws. And he\u2019s pushing a conservative agenda well within the GOP mainstream on issues that include tax breaks for married couples, an overhaul of higher education policies and a reform of welfare programs.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "Mike Lee\u2019s position back home is turning the GOP civil war on its head.", "title": "Tea partier braces for primary challenge from establishment", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/12/mike-lee-tea-party-2016-elections-113730.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/12/21/141221_mike_lee_ap_629.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Senate Republicans,Tea Party,Senate,Conservatives,GOP,Mike Lee,Utah", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "Mike Lee\u2019s position back home is turning the GOP civil war on its head.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdf8a\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWe are 100 percent committed to getting Sen.
