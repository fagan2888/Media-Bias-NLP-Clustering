Hairy Bikers' Christmas special part two: German onion muffins



German onion muffins

Makes 6



40g butter

1 medium onion, finely chopped

175g plain flour

1 tsp caster sugar

1 tsp baking powder

1 tsp bicarbonate of soda

½ tsp flaked sea salt

2 tbsp finely chopped fresh dill

250ml buttermilk

2 medium free-range eggs

1 tsp poppy seeds



❄ Melt the butter in a small pan and gently fry the onion for 10 minutes or until softened and lightly browned, stirring regularly. Set aside to cool for a few minutes. Preheat the oven to 200°C/180°C Fan/Gas 6. Line a 6-hole muffin tin with paper muffin cases or some squares of baking parchment.



❄ Sift the flour into a large mixing bowl and stir in the sugar, baking powder, bicarbonate of soda, salt and chopped dill. Make a well in the centre. Stir the buttermilk into the onion and break the eggs on top, then stir well with a wooden spoon. Pour the mixture on to the flour and stir lightly until only just combined.



❄ Divide the mixture between the muffin cases, sprinkle with poppy seeds and bake in the centre of the oven for 16-20 minutes until the muffins are puffed up and golden brown. Scrumptious served warm but great cold too.
