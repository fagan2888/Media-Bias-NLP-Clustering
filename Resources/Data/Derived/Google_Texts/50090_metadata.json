As part of the reconstruction, the cricket pitch was shifted slightly to eliminate an overlap with a softball field, and to give the area's increasing number of mostly South Asian and West Indian cricketers a bit more elbow room. But the new layout allowed a veritable stream of hard, leather-covered cricket balls to sail over the park's 16-foot-high fence.\n\n\n\nWithin days, complaints began landing on desks at Community Board 10. In response, late last year Frank Dardani, chairman of the community board's park committee, reached out to the Parks Department for relief. \"The department sent someone to evaluate the problem and then ordered the material,\" he said. As of Nov. 12, eight feet of netting had been added to the fence, and area residents were heaving a sigh of relief. \"This shouldn't be a problem anymore,\" said Mr. Dardani.\n\nGet Crain's Real Estate Daily (RED) Alert Sign up for our FREE daily Real Estate Alert email newsletter.
