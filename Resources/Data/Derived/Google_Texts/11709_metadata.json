Copy may not be in its final form.\n\nJUAN GONZ\u00c1LEZ: The battle between a Democrat known as \"Mayor 1 Percent\" and a host of challengers has reached a fever pitch in Chicago. Mayor 1 Percent is what critics call Mayor Rahm Emanuel, who is struggling to keep his seat when voters head to the polls on Tuesday. Opponents say he has failed to improve the city\u2019s schools and address gun violence. Emanuel\u2019s re-election campaign has a war chest of more than $15 million, about four times the amount raised by his four opponents combined. Most of his funds come from about a hundred donors. About half of the money, more than $7 million, has been spent on television ads like this one.\n\nRAHM EMANUEL CAMPAIGN AD: Chicago\u2019s leading voices support Rahm Emanuel for mayor. The Defender backs Rahm, praising the largest job gains of any major city. The Tribune says, because of Mayor Emanuel, students spend more hours in the classroom and have full-day kindergarten. The Sun-Times called Rahm \"bold\" and \"courageous.\" And President Obama says Emanuel is the mayor we need.\n\nPRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: He\u2019s making sure every Chicagoan in every neighborhood gets the fair shot at success that they deserve.\n\nJUAN GONZ\u00c1LEZ: Featured in that ad is President Obama, who visited Chicago last week to endorse his former White House chief of staff.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: Emanuel faces five challengers in a nonpartisan race that requires him to win 51 percent of the vote or face a runoff in April. The city hasn\u2019t seen a runoff since it adopted the nonpartisan system in the 1990s. His closest rival is Jes\u00fas \"Chuy\" Garc\u00eda, a county commissioner who has support from the Chicago Teachers Union and other labor and progressive groups. Polls show about 20 percent of voters back Garc\u00eda. The other three candidates are businessman Willie Wilson, Chicago Alderman Robert Fioretti and William \"Dock\" Walls, who is a former aid to the former Chicago mayor, Harold Washington.\n\nWell, for more, we\u2019re going to Chicago to speak with journalist Rick Perlstein. His recent piece for In These Times is headlined \"How to Sell Off a City: Welcome to Rahm Emanuel\u2019s Chicago, the Privatized Metropolis of the Future.\"\n\nRick, welcome to Democracy Now! Why don\u2019t you lay out this race for people who are not closely following it, especially those outside Chicago?\n\nRICK PERLSTEIN: Absolutely. It\u2019s a strikingly stark choice for the voters tomorrow about who\u2019s going to control the city. Is it going to be the citizens or the 1 percent or the .1 percent? Juan mentioned that he raised $15 million\u2014I refer to Rahm Emanuel. That\u2019s misleading. He actually raised $30 million, $15 for his political action committee that he\u2019s used to basically create a new Chicago political machine. And the things he\u2019s been able to get away with with that money is absolutely stark, absolutely horrifying. And we really face a crossroads for the city tomorrow.\n\nJUAN GONZ\u00c1LEZ: Well, Rick, why don\u2019t you lay out some of the signature initiatives that Emanuel embarked on during his first term?\n\nRICK PERLSTEIN: Well, it\u2019s pretty striking. With a month to go before the election, when the advertising started, he basically made him sound like Eleanor Roosevelt. He did talk about things like some actually excellent work he\u2019s done with the community colleges and a minimum wage hike that\u2019s going to be phased in over 10 years. But the fact of the matter is his real work has been in things like privatization. He struck a deal with a bunch of investment banks to use the preschoolers of Chicago as collateral for a deal in which a bunch of bankers are going to get money if the test scores of preschool kids increase. He did things like privatize the janitorial corps in Chicago schools, and they did such a bad job\u2014this is the company Aramark, the services company based in Pennsylvania\u2014that parents had to come in a week before the school year and clean the schools themselves. And Aramark\u2019s response to that was to cut a quarter of its workforce. It goes on and on and on.\n\nThere\u2019s been some excellent investigative journalism by the very publications that have shamefully endorsed Rahm Emanuel. The Chicago Tribune found that of his top 106 donors, 60 of them had received favors from the city. The Sun-Times did a really amazing expos\u00e9 on a member of the school board that he appointed\u2014we have an appointed school board in Chicago, which is also a scandal\u2014who is an investment\u2014who runs an investment fund for school privatization companies, and discovered that her company had basically increased its billing with the Chicago Public Schools about 300 percent and that a lot of these contracts were for $24,999, because if they\u2019re for $25,000 or more, then you actually have to have accountability. A final investigative report by the International Business Times found that he\u2019s using a kind of secret slush fund, called \"direct voucher payments,\" in which he\u2019s able to shovel money to his contributors without contracts, without bidding and without any kind of paper trail about how they\u2019re spending the money, whether they\u2019re using it to provide services to the city or not. He is a\u2014really, really, really been a strikingly corrupt mayor. And his ability to get away with it, if he gets away with it tomorrow, will redound to the shame of the citizenry of this city.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: Rick Perlstein, we\u2019re going to break and then come back to this discussion. Rick Perlstein is a Chicago-based reporter whose recent piece in In These Times was headlined \"How to Sell Off a City: Welcome to Rahm Emanuel\u2019s Chicago, the Privatized Metropolis of the Future.\" This is Democracy Now! We\u2019ll be back with Rick Perlstein in a minute.\n\n[break]\n\nAMY GOODMAN: That\u2019s John Legend and Common performing \"Glory\" at the Oscars last night. That song, the theme song from Selma, won for Best Song. And a slight correction on the headlines: Yes, the Oscars were the whitest in many years. There was no black actor or director who was nominated. The Mexican director, Alejandro I\u00f1\u00e1rritu, won for Best Director. This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report. I\u2019m Amy Goodman, with Juan Gonz\u00e1lez, as we continue on the Chicago mayoral elections. Last week, President Obama traveled to Chicago to designate the city\u2019s Pullman area a national monument. He used the occasion to bolster Rahm Emanuel\u2019s candidacy for mayor. This is part of what he said while speaking to a crowd of students and teachers at Gwendolyn Brooks College Preparatory Academy.\n\nPRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Before Rahm was a big-shot mayor, he was an essential part of my team at the White House during some very hard times for America. And I relied on his judgment every day and his smarts every day and his toughness every day.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: President Obama, speaking Thursday in Chicago. Last month, he also recorded a radio ad endorsing Rahm Emanuel.\n\nPRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: You know, even though I\u2019m working in Washington right now, Chicago is my home. It\u2019s the place that made me who I am. That\u2019s why I care so deeply about who leads our city. Before Rahm Emanuel was mayor of Chicago, he was a key part of my team at the White House. And let\u2019s be honest: At times the guy can be a little hardheaded. But there\u2019s a reason Rahm fights as hard as he does: He loves our city, and he believes every child in every neighborhood should have a fair shot at success. Chicago had the shortest school day of any American city, until Rahm insisted that our kids get the same educational opportunity as other kids. He delivered full-day kindergarten to every Chicago child. That\u2019s not all. He raised the minimum wage, and he helped create thousands of Chicago jobs by bringing new businesses to town. If you want a mayor who does what\u2019s right, not just what\u2019s popular, who fights night and day for the city we love, then I hope you\u2019ll join me. Vote for Rahm Emanuel on Tuesday, February 24th.\n\nJUAN GONZ\u00c1LEZ: That was President Obama in a radio ad endorsing Rahm Emanuel. We\u2019re joined once again by Rick Perlstein, Chicago-based reporter. Rick, talk about, specifically about, education and the\u2014what Emanuel has done in education, what it meant that Karen Lewis, the Chicago Teachers Union president, had to drop out of a potential race against him.\n\nRICK PERLSTEIN: Yeah, the president, in his commercial, said, you know, Rahm Emanuel is fighting for all the kids. And, you know, that\u2019s nonsense. In the first meeting that Rahm had\u2014we call him Rahm here, it\u2019s kind of silly\u2014with Karen Lewis, who\u2019s the very progressive and very tough and very brilliant head of Chicago\u2019s teachers\u2019 union, he said 20 percent of the school kids in Chicago just can\u2019t be saved. And she was shocked. I mean, she was aghast. And right then and there, she decided that this guy was a malevolent force for the schools in Chicago.\n\nAnd she was vindicated in that judgment. The first thing he did in announcing that he was going to try and extend the school day, which everyone supported, was announce that he was not going to pay the teachers any more for extending their workday, and took away an already negotiated 7 percent pay increase. Of course, then they went on strike. And Karen Lewis and the Chicago teachers, in a great show of people power\u2014Chicagoans all remember the vision of thousands of Chicago teachers in their red T-shirts at the Auditorium Theatre and then marching into streets\u2014they humiliated him. They beat him in a strike that he went down to Springfield to rig the laws to prevent. He basically helped pass a law saying that a strike couldn\u2019t happen unless they had 75 percent of the membership voting for it. Well, they had about 98 percent of the membership voting for a strike. And his response was to lay off teachers, which he\u2019s allowed to do. The idea that teachers are hard to fire is certainly a myth when it comes to Chicago. He does it all the time, or, I should say, his appointed school board, answerable only to him, does it all the time.\n\nAnd then, the coup de gr\u00e2ce was this absolutely shocking act of closing 50 schools, without any citizen input. I went to a meeting in which his school officials were standing on the stage, being cried to by adolescents who were begging them not to close their schools. And there was a police officer on stage, as if these 12-year-olds were going to somehow rush the stage. And when he announced he was going to close the schools, and he gave his explanation, and that explanation turned out to be threadbare, and he gave another explanation, the Chicago public radio station, WBEZ, did an analysis, and they found all eight explanations for why they were closing these 50 schools were all factually false and often contradicted each other. It was a complete power grab. And what he\u2019s done is he\u2019s emptied out the core, the skeleton of these communities in this divide-and-conquer strategy, and he\u2019s basically used the resources that were created by closing those schools to strengthen the schools in kind of the white, yuppie neighborhoods. It\u2019s absolutely scandalous.\n\nJUAN GONZ\u00c1LEZ: And what about\u2014\n\nRICK PERLSTEIN: And Karen Lewis, of course\u2014yes.\n\nJUAN GONZ\u00c1LEZ: What about the candidate that Karen Lewis supported, Chuy Garc\u00eda. Could you tell us something about him, as well?\n\nRICK PERLSTEIN: Well, briefly, Karen Lewis was ready to announce for mayor and tragically was struck by a brain tumor, an absolute blow for social justice, for everyone who cares about social justice in America. And she kind of handed the torch to a very competent reformer named Chuy Garc\u00eda, who has held all kinds of offices\u2014state senator, alderman, now he\u2019s on the county board. Every time he goes to work for the people of Chicago, the machine basically goes after him. That\u2019s why he\u2019s held so many offices. And he\u2019s an excellent public servant.\n\nWith Toni Preckwinkle, who many of us had hoped would run, because she\u2019s done such an excellent job as the president of the county board, together they were able to balance a very big budget deficit, while lowering taxes\u2014they got rid of a sales tax\u2014just by doing the thing all politicians claim they\u2019re going to do: eliminating waste, fraud and abuse from the budget. They did it very effectively. And by the way, when the Chicago Tribune endorsed Rahm Emanuel for delivering balanced budgets, which I think he\u2019s done using all kinds of budget chicanery, they ignored the fact that Chuy Garc\u00eda, in addition to being a very strong reformer and a very compassionate man and a very competent public servant, had done the same thing for Cook County. He would be an excellent mayor.\n\nJUAN GONZ\u00c1LEZ: And where is the most prominent Latino politician in Chicago, Luis Guti\u00e9rrez, in this race?\n\nRICK PERLSTEIN: Well, I don\u2019t believe\u2014I am not aware of who he\u2019s supporting, but he is not running. He, you know, is happy to be in Congress. And that would be an interesting question.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: We played President Obama\u2019s endorsement of Rahm Emanuel. Can you talk about how President Obama, of course, who lived in Chicago for many years, how his endorsement plays?\n\nRICK PERLSTEIN: Yeah, it\u2019s really striking that he\u2019s won that endorsement. I mean, if Rahm Emanuel had his druthers, we wouldn\u2019t have the\u2014of course, the Affordable Care Act, because, you know, this idea that Rahm Emanuel is this tough, fighting politician who\u2019s really courageous is, of course, nonsense. When he was the chief of staff in the White House, he advised Obama not to take on any fights that he didn\u2019t know he could win in advance. And that\u2019s why he thought universal healthcare was a bad play for him. And Nancy Pelosi had to talk Obama into it. And, you know, he\u2019s a loyal guy, is Barack Obama, so he\u2019s doing the announcement.\n\nAnd Obama certainly doesn\u2019t cover the kind of sway that he had in Chicago when he was elected. You don\u2019t see the Barack Obama kitsch in the Walgreens, and you don\u2019t see the kind of family portraits in the barbershops that you used to see, but certainly he does still command a lot of loyalty among the portion of the population that Rahm Emanuel is weakest with. African Americans abandoned him in droves because of the school stuff. They knew exactly what was going on. And no mayor can get elected in Chicago without African-American support. In fact, black voters were the backbone of the old Daley machine. So, this will shore up some of that crucial support, without which Rahm Emanuel\u2019s re-election bid would be hopeless.\n\nJUAN GONZ\u00c1LEZ: And one of the things that you\u2019ve mentioned that most people are not aware of is the big issue that has arisen in Chicago over cameras and traffic lights\u2014\n\nRICK PERLSTEIN: Right.\n\nJUAN GONZ\u00c1LEZ: \u2014and what Emanuel has done. Can you explain that, in terms of traffic tickets?\n\nRICK PERLSTEIN: It really speaks to the mendacity and corruption of this administration. Basically, he has claimed that he has instituted red light cameras at street corners all over Chicago for the safety of the city. Well, the first vendor actually lost the contract because one of the city officials had been bribed to the tune of several million dollars. And another consultant, actually, a guy named Greg Goldner, is a very close associate of Rahm Emanuel\u2019s. Now, it turns out that the red light cameras are a revenue grab. They\u2019re basically a regressive tax on the drivers of Chicago. And what he\u2019s done is he\u2019s shaved the time for yellow lights, so they could give out more tickets.\n\nAnd he claims\u2014his City Hall has claimed that it has lowered accidents of cars crashing into the side of other cars by 47 percent. Well, the Chicago Tribune did a study and found that it really had only lowered accidents 17 percent and increased rear-end accidents by a great deal. So he\u2019s basically endangering the safety of the city of Chicago, giving the drivers of Chicago a huge hassle that they have to deal with, and he\u2019s been increasingly dishonest about it. And he\u2019s been called on it. And he\u2019s been able to get away with it because he\u2019s been able to buy $30 million worth of mailers and TV commercials and D.C.-style political consultants.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: So, tomorrow, explain what happens. It\u2019s an unusual election. A lot of cities don\u2019t have a system like this, a nonpartisan election.\n\nRICK PERLSTEIN: Right, right. We have a nonpartisan election. And it\u2019s first past the post, if you get to 50 percent, and then it\u2019s over. So, Rahm Emanuel\u2014it\u2019s basically Rahm Emanuel against everyone else. So, if he gets to 50 percent, he has another term. If he gets 49.9 percent, then there will be a runoff with the second-place finisher, who is likely to be Chuy Garc\u00eda. And then, between February and April, we\u2019ll have a real conversation about the future of this city. And that\u2019s why progressives in Chicago absolutely have to get themselves to the polls. It\u2019s 4 degrees today, it might be 2 degrees tomorrow, but this is a life-and-death situation for the citizens of Chicago.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: Well, we want to thank you, Rick Perlstein, for being with us, Chicago-based reporter whose recent piece for In These Times is headlined \"How to Sell Off a City: Welcome to Rahm Emanuel\u2019s Chicago, the Privatized Metropolis of the Future.\" We\u2019ll be back in a minute.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Democracy Now!", "description": "The battle between Rahm Emanuel \u2014 a Democrat known as \"Mayor 1 Percent\" \u2014 and a host of challengers has reached a fever pitch in Chicago.
