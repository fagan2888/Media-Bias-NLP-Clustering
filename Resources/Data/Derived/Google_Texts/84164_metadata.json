(\u201cHave you peed yet?\u201d is an obsessive point of inquiry.)\n\nLast Saturday the schedule called for 17 miles, but when only two of 10 members said they\u2019d be able to make it, I fired off an email to the team captain.\n\nI think it\u2019s ridiculous to make a pit crew hang around five hours for just the two of us, I petulantly wrote. We can carry our own food and water.\n\nI immediately heard back from Lisa Weisbrod-Amira.\n\nDoing the pit crew and cheering each other on has just been part of our team\u2019s history; it is second nature, she wrote. When I did not walk last year I crewed because it gave me a chance to still be part of the team. I have past members asking when they can volunteer each week. I know it may seem silly but these ladies really do want to be there.\n\nAppropriately chastised, I acquiesced. (I told you I wasn\u2019t good at this group thing.) So the next morning at 6 a.m., there was a cheery Deb Studebaker, the team\u2019s longtime previous captain and her friend Pam Ater from Orlando, another former walker.\n\nIn her pink, separate-toed socks Deb sent us off in the dark with a lit ballcap and \u201cWalking in the Sunshine\u201d blaring on the car CD. She was there at the end of Mile 17, with an ice-cold Bud Light Lime, unsqueamishly accepting a disgustingly sweaty hug. And in between she provided whatever was called for \u2014 Propel, ice, bacon.\n\nI started to understand what Lisa was talking about.\n\nEight years ago, Deb, an art teacher, moved to the home where she now lives and met a neighbor, Margo Dolan, the prior WIS captain. Deb had lost her husband to colon cancer and when Margo urged her to join, she was drawn \u201clike a magnet.\u201d\n\nHer only reservation \u2014 mine too \u2014 was that part about camping for two nights with a stranger in a pink pup tent between thousands of others.\n\n\u201cOh, I don\u2019t do that,\u201d Margo scoffed. \u201cI go to the Hilton.\u201d\n\nReplied Deb: \u201cI\u2019m in.\u201d\n\nDeb walked the next seven years. She bought more pink paraphernalia than any one person ought to own. She walked in blazing sun and pre-Hurricane Sandy rain. She endured full foot blisters and sob-filled final ceremonies.\n\nLast year, about mile 30, she decided it would be her last finish line. By then nearly her entire social life centered around the walkers she\u2019d met along the way.\n\nThe night of our 17-mile trainer, Deb invited me to her house. I got the address wrong, but I found the house by the parked cars with pink bumper stickers.\n\nInside, a bunch of really nice women \u2014 and a few men \u2014 gathered around a kitchen counter laden with hand painted (pink, naturally) wineglasses, pink plastic utensils and a stack of photography books, each labeled with the year of a 3-Day walk. They warmly welcomed a newbie, offering funny stories, happy memories, great tips. (Bless you, Rick Borres, for telling me I could grab a tent and plunk it anywhere, thus avoiding the tenting-with-a-stranger dilemma.)\n\nAs I said my thank yous, Deb followed me out.\n\n\u201cI kid you not,\u201d she said with a solemnness out of character with the level of wine consumption.\n\n\u201cThis is going to change your life.\u201d\n\nComing from someone who knows the value of a nice hotel room after a 20-mile tromp, I completely believed her.\n\nCarrie Seidman will report each month in Health+Fitness on Walking on Sunshine\u2019s preparation for the Tampa Bay Susan G.
