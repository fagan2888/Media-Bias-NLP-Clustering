Now the rusty red columns soar above ground into the sunlit glass atrium that encloses the entrance to the museum.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re so large \u2014 about 70 feet tall \u2014 that we built the museum around them,\u201d explained Joseph Daniels, president of the memorial and museum.\n\nDown a long ramp, visitors will peer down to glimpse the last piece of steel removed from ground zero in 2002, which sits inside a gaping silvery chamber that drops to the lowest level of the museum.\n\nFurther down the ramp, visitors will discover a mangled and twisted piece of steel that Daniels calls \u201cimpact steel.\u201d That\u2019s because this piece of the building was actually destroyed by the impact of Flight 11 slamming into the North Tower.\n\n\u201cYou can see how, at the bottom, the columns are bent back,\u201d Daniels said. \u201cThat\u2019s because Flight 11\u2019s nose, when it pierced the building, it bent steel like that.\u201d\n\nPerhaps the most chilling part of the museum, in its current form, is a battered staircase that leads down to bedrock, where the exhibits will be displayed. Sandwiched between an escalator and a staircase that will be used by museum visitors, the \u201csurvivor\u2019s stairs\u201d provided an escape route for hundreds of people who fled from the towers on Sept. 11, 2001.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re literally following the same pathway that hundreds followed on 9/11 to survival, to safety,\u201d said museum director Alice Greenwald. \u201cIn some respects, what we\u2019re saying to our visitors is, we all live in a world now that was defined by this event. And in that sense, we\u2019re all survivors of 9/11.\u201d\n\nThere are more relics, some of them shrouded in plastic or white drapery, awaiting their public debut:\n\nThe \u201cflag steel\u201d shaped like a ribbon that resembled a flag blowing in the breeze. The T-shaped steel column and crossbeam that became known as the \u201cWorld Trade Center cross,\u201d a piece of the rubble that became a symbol of hope to hundreds of recovery workers.\n\nThe fire truck from Engine Company 21, whose cab was destroyed while the rest of the truck remained intact.\n\nWhen completed in the spring, the museum will transport people through time from events leading to the 9/11 attacks all the way to the current events of today. And even when its doors open, the museum will always remain a work in progress.\n\n\u201cThis is a museum, I like to say, that\u2019s not about answers,\u201d Greenwald said. \u201cIt\u2019s a museum about questions. And we end with questions, and we then invite the public to participate in that dialogue.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "NEW YORK \u2014 Far below the earth where the twin towers once stood, a cavernous museum on hallowed ground is finally nearing completion.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "NEW YORK \u2014 Far below the earth where the twin towers once stood, a cavernous museum on hallowed ground is finally nearing completion.", "title": "9/11 Museum nears completion; \u2018survivor\u2019s stairs,\u2019 chilling artifacts prepared", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/sep/7/911-museum-nears-completion-survivors-stairs-chill/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2011/09/08/20110908-175046-pic-152778595.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2011/09/08/20110908-175046-pic-152778595.jpg", "description": "NEW YORK \u2014 Far below the earth where the twin towers once stood, a cavernous museum on hallowed ground is finally nearing completion.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "9/11 Museum nears completion; \u2018survivor\u2019s stairs,\u2019 c"}, "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Hospitality Recreation, Joseph Daniels"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0320\"", "article_summary": "NEW YORK \u2014 Far below the earth where the twin towers once stood, a cavernous museum on hallowed ground is finally nearing completion.\n\u201cYou\u2019re literally following the same pathway that hundreds followed on 9/11 to survival, to safety,\u201d said museum director Alice Greenwald.\n\u201cThey\u2019re so large \u2014 about 70 feet tall \u2014 that we built the museum around them,\u201d explained Joseph Daniels, president of the memorial and museum.\nNow the rusty red columns soar above ground into the sunlit glass atrium that encloses the entrance to the museum.\nSandwiched between an escalator and a staircase that will be used by museum visitors, the \u201csurvivor\u2019s stairs\u201d provided an escape route for hundreds of people who fled from the towers on Sept. 11, 2001."}
