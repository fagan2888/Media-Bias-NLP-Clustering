On March 5th, many are taking a brand new version of the SAT entrance exam for the first time.\n\nThe whole idea behind the exam\u2019s makeover is to move away from \u201ctest preparation\u201d and instead capture what students have actually learned in class.\n\nSo all that obscure vocabulary is gone, the essay is optional and there\u2019s more algebra and less geometry.\n\nCyndie Schmeiser is chief of assessment for the College Board, which administers the exam. Here\u2019s how she explains the changes.\n\n\u201cThe most important of which is the change that focuses the test on the knowledge and the skills that current research tells us are the most essential for college and career readiness and success,\u201d Schmeiser said.\n\nTo help students perform well, the College Board has also partnered with the Khan Academy to offer free prep tools.\n\nBut some students might find the new SAT tougher than the old version. To start, there\u2019s more reading \u2013 and not just where you\u2019d expect.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen students really needing to be comfortable with long reading passages, not just in the reading comprehension section, but in the math as well,\u201d said Michael Boothroyd, who directs the college admissions programs at Kaplan Test Prep.\n\nHe said that the math questions aren\u2019t straight numbers. Students have to read the questions, pull out the math from the text and solve it.\n\n\u201cThat is a very different experience and students who aren\u2019t strong in reading \u2014 whether it\u2019s because that\u2019s just not their strong suite, or perhaps maybe because English is their second language or third language or for whatever reason \u2014 may find themselves having to really study in and focus on the math section and understand the role that reading has in that,\u201d Boothroyd said.\n\nOn the flip side, Boothroyd said that Kaplan also found more graphics and statistics in the reading and writing sections.\n\nThe good news for test-takers is that there\u2019s no longer a penalty for guessing the answer and getting it wrong.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Education News", "description": "Many high school students will take the college entrance test for the first time on Saturday.", "programs": "none", "og": {"site_name": "Houston Public Media", "description": "Many high school students will take the college entrance test for the first time on Saturday.", "title": "Students Across Greater Houston Meet New SAT For First Time | Houston Public Media", "url": "http://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/news/2016/03/05/140318/students-across-greater-houston-meet-new-sat-for-first-time/", "image": {"secure_url": "https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/04172905/HandsRaised4-1200x800.png", "url": "http://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/04172905/HandsRaised4-1200x800.png", "height": 800, "width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/04172905/HandsRaised4-1200x800.png", "type": "image/png"}, "type": "article"}, "story_id": 469307338, "twitter": {"description": "Many high school students will take the college entrance test for the first time on Saturday.", "creator": "@houstonpubmedia", "url": "http://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/news/2016/03/05/140318/students-across-greater-houston-meet-new-sat-for-first-time/", "image": "http://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/04172905/HandsRaised4-1200x800.png", "title": "Students Across Greater Houston Meet New SAT For First Time", "site": "@houstonpubmedia", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Laura Isensee", "wordCount": 355, "org_id": 220, "datePublished": "2016-03-05T06:30:05+00:00", "fb": {"admins": 37511993, "app_id": 1520489194943572, "pages": 27589213702}, "bitly-verification": "7777946f1a0a", "google-site-verification": "QOrBnMZ1LXDA9tL3e5WmFUU-oI3JUbDRotOWST1P_Dg", "keywords": "Education News, News, college admissions, College Board, high school, higher education, hisd, SAT, test prep", "article": {"section": "News", "tag": "test prep", "published_time": "2016-03-05T06:30:05+00:00"}, "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe42d4\"", "article_summary": "Many high school students will take the college entrance test for the first time on Saturday.\nTo help students perform well, the College Board has also partnered with the Khan Academy to offer free prep tools.\nThe whole idea behind the exam\u2019s makeover is to move away from \u201ctest preparation\u201d and instead capture what students have actually learned in class.\nOn the flip side, Boothroyd said that Kaplan also found more graphics and statistics in the reading and writing sections.\nIt\u2019s a new world for students applying to college."}
