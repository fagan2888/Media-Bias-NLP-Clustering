He has thrown for 1,436 yards and eight touchdowns and tossed four interceptions. He is 3-2 as a starter. Again, serviceable. The problem is, the Broncos aren\u2019t in the business of rebuilding or developing prospects. They have a championship-caliber defense. Osweiler is capable of leading the Broncos to victory if the offensive scheme is adjusted to create better options after his first read.\n\nJhabvala: Osweiler has proven he can do it in big settings. He did it in Chicago, in freezing temperatures on the road and against his former coaches. He did it at home, in snow against the then-unbeaten Patriots. Consistency has and continues to be the issue \u2014 for him and the Denver offense. Osweiler and the Broncos went 25 consecutive possessions without scoring a touchdown. Then they turned in four consecutive drives resulting in touchdowns in the first two quarters at Pittsburgh before going dormant again.\n\nRenck: The Broncos\u2019 second-half production has gone from puzzling to pitiful. Denver hasn\u2019t scored in the third quarter in six games this season. The Broncos have been outscored 36-0 in the second half of the past three games. Osweiler has shown he can play well with a 15-play script. In the second half, he needs to counterpunch. This offense averages three shots downfield per game. Osweiler is 5-for-22 with one touchdown and two interceptions on passes of 20-plus yards. If he doesn\u2019t connect on one Monday night against Cincinnati, Denver won\u2019t win.\n\nJhabvala: This offense begins and ends with the running game. The Broncos gained 88 of their 104 yards rushing in the first half against Pittsburgh. And we know how the final two quarters unfolded. The Broncos had only 34 yards rushing in their loss to Oakland. Compare that with the previous three victories, in which they averaged 161 yards rushing, and it\u2019s clear this offense thrives and survives on a balanced attack.\n\nRenck: There is no guarantee that Peyton Manning will play again this season. My gut feeling is that his injured left foot will allow one more game, whether that\u2019s against San Diego in the regular-season finale or in a playoff game. The Broncos can win with Osweiler. But he needs help. It\u2019s time for veteran tight end Vernon Davis to stop alligator-arming in the clutch and deliver his first touchdown reception since the 2014 season opener. And it\u2019s time for Demaryius Thomas to produce a signature moment this season, either on a score or a critical third down.\n\nJhabvala: The drops on crucial downs have been painful \u2014 and you would like to see Thomas, especially, have one big game, if only for a confidence builder. But the drops alone can\u2019t be blamed for the offense\u2019s inefficiency late in close games.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Can Brock Osweiler deliver Monday night in the biggest game of his NFL career?", "title": "Can Brock Osweiler deliver Monday night in the biggest game of his NFL career?", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/12/26/can-brock-osweiler-deliver-monday-night-in-the-biggest-game-of-his-nfl-career/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/20151226__SP20FBNBRONX_JA26350ap1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/20151226__SP20FBNBRONX_JA26350ap1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-26T13:16:34+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-21T21:11:12+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Brock Osweiler"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1ecf\"", "article_summary": "The Broncos gained 88 of their 104 yards rushing in the first half against Pittsburgh.\nThe Broncos had only 34 yards rushing in their loss to Oakland.\nCompare that with the previous three victories, in which they averaged 161 yards rushing, and it\u2019s clear this offense thrives and survives on a balanced attack.\nRenck: Frame Brock Osweiler\u2019s season with those of inexperienced NFL quarterbacks, and he has been solid.\nOsweiler is capable of leading the Broncos to victory if the offensive scheme is adjusted to create better options after his first read."}
