Bonner, of St. Louis Park, remains free until his Feb. 20 sentencing.\n\n\u201cWe are very pleased with the jury\u2019s verdict, and we appreciate their attentiveness in this case,\u201d said County Attorney Mike Freeman. \u201cThere is never an excuse for stealing from hardworking employees, but as a lawyer, I find it even more intolerable that an attorney would act this way.\u201d\n\nAccording to the criminal complaint, between March 3, 2011, and Jan. 31, 2012, Bonner swindled two employees out of more than $10,000 by withholding money from their paychecks as expected but not depositing the money into an individual retirement account as directed by the employees.\n\n\u201cHe commingled the money with the general fund to pay himself and to pay his firm\u2019s bills,\u201d Assistant County Attorney Morgan Kunz said in his closing argument.\n\nThe case focused on barely more than $6,000 and just a five-month period \u2014 from August 2011 to January 2012 \u2014 because the three-year statute of limitations had run out on any possible earlier thefts by the time the county attorney\u2019s office received the case last summer.\n\nPaul Walsh", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "County Attorney Mike Freeman said, \"There is never an excuse for stealing from hardworking employees, but as a lawyer, I find it even more intolerable that an attorney would act this way.\"", "title": "Attorney convicted of theft from his firm's employees", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/attorney-convicted-of-theft-from-his-firm-s-employees/287453151/", "image": {"url": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201083", "width": 1680, "identifier": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201083", "height": 876}, "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "twitter": {"description": "County Attorney Mike Freeman said, \"There is never an excuse for stealing from hardworking employees, but as a lawyer, I find it even more intolerable that an attorney would act this way.\"", "title": "Attorney convicted of theft from his firm's employees", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/attorney-convicted-of-theft-from-his-firm-s-employees/287453151/", "image": {"src": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201083", "identifier": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201083"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "description": "County Attorney Mike Freeman said, \"There is never an excuse for stealing from hardworking employees, but as a lawyer, I find it even more intolerable that an attorney would act this way.\""}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd04a3\"", "article_summary": "A Minneapolis attorney has been convicted of stealing money from his firm\u2019s employee retirement accounts, the Hennepin County attorney\u2019s office announced.\n\u201cWe are very pleased with the jury\u2019s verdict, and we appreciate their attentiveness in this case,\u201d said County Attorney Mike Freeman.\n\u201cHe commingled the money with the general fund to pay himself and to pay his firm\u2019s bills,\u201d Assistant County Attorney Morgan Kunz said in his closing argument.\nJurors took about three hours Friday to convict Bonner, a partner in Bonner & Borhart, of theft by swindle in a trial that began the previous Monday.\nTwo employees of John Bonner III, 69, had money stolen during a five-month period, and prosecutors wanted to investigate further back in time but were thwarted by the statute of limitations."}
