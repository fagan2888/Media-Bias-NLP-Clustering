(AP) \u2014 As part of Michelle Obama\u2019s healthy eating initiative, a group of major food retailers promised in 2011 to open or expand 1,500 grocery or convenience stores in and around neighborhoods with no supermarkets by 2016. By their own count, they\u2019re far short.\n\nMoreover, an analysis of federal food stamp data by The Associated Press reveals that the nation\u2019s largest chains \u2014 not just the handful involved in the first lady\u2019s group \u2014 have since built new supermarkets in only a fraction of the neighborhoods where they\u2019re needed most.\n\nThe Partnership for a Healthier America, which also promotes good nutrition and exercise in its anti-obesity mission, considers improving access to fresh food a key part of the solution. But the AP\u2019s research demonstrates that major grocers overwhelmingly avoid America\u2019s food deserts instead of trying to turn a profit in high-poverty areas.\n\nAmong the AP\u2019s findings:\n\n\u2014 The nation\u2019s top 75 food retailers opened almost 10,300 stores in new locations from 2011 to the first quarter of 2015, 2,434 of which were grocery stores. Take away convenience stores and \u201cdollar stores,\u201d which generally don\u2019t sell fresh fruits, vegetables or meat, and barely more than 250 of the new supermarkets were in so-called food deserts, or neighborhoods without stores that offer fresh produce and meats.\n\n\u2014 As the largest supermarket chains have been slow to build in food deserts, dollar stores have multiplied rapidly. Three chains \u2014 Dollar General, Family Dollar and Dollar Tree \u2014 made up two-thirds of new stores in food deserts. And the dollar store sector is consolidating: Dollar Tree merged with Family Dollar this year, creating the largest dollar-store chain in the nation and, in the process, less competition and less incentive to diversify what these stores offer.\n\n\u2014 Excluding dollar stores and 7-Elevens, just 1.4 million of the more than 18 million people the USDA says lived in food deserts as of 2010 got a new supermarket in the past four years.\n\nOn top of all that, it\u2019s difficult to say how many more people live in newer food deserts created by recent store closures.\n\nViola Hill used to walk several times a week to a Schnucks supermarket a block away from her apartment in her struggling north St. Louis neighborhood, until that store shuttered last year. Now, she can get to a supermarket only once a month, when she pays a friend $10 to drive her to one several miles away.\n\n\u201cI have to get enough food to last me a whole month,\u201d said Hill, a retiree who likes to cook chicken and green beans. \u201cIt hurt us really badly when they closed because we depended on the Schnucks for medication and my food there. It was a lot of people hurt, not just me.\u201d\n\nSchnucks officials said they were losing money on the store, which now sits boarded up with weeds growing in its parking lot.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture considers a neighborhood a food desert if at least a fifth of the residents live in poverty and a third live more than a mile from a supermarket in urban areas, or more than 10 miles in rural areas, where residents are more likely to have cars.\n\nThe first lady\u2019s group\u2019s 2014 progress report, its most recent, says the companies that made pledges have opened or renovated 602 grocery stores or other food retail locations, well below halfway toward their collective goal.\n\nThe partnership counted companies as having met their commitments if the stores they opened or renovated fell within a mile of a USDA-designated food desert in a city, or within 10 miles of a rural one. The AP analyzed which of the new stores that opened lie directly within food deserts.\n\nResearch has shown that a lack of access to healthy foods contributes to health problems, such as obesity and diabetes. Proximity to a supermarket can make a big difference in what people eat, especially if they don\u2019t drive, although other factors such as food culture also play a role.\n\nEven though a neighborhood without a supermarket may have a corner grocer, the large chains have much greater leverage and economies of scale to bring a wider of variety of products at cheaper prices.\n\nJock Riggins likes to cook and tries as often as he can to make his favorite meal of cube steak with bell peppers, rice and gravy. But getting to the supermarket nearest to his home in Eatonville, Florida, north of Orlando, requires pedaling his rusted bicycle down a clogged, six-lane road with narrow shoulders, and balancing bags of groceries in each hand on the way back.\n\n\u201cIf I don\u2019t have my vegetables for my food I substitute with sandwiches,\u201d said Riggins, 51, who gets by working odd jobs. \u201cIf there was a supermarket closer, I wouldn\u2019t have to go way out on Lee Road. It would be better.\u201d\n\n___\n\nA FOOD OASIS\n\nLess than 3 miles from Eatonville is what could only be described as a food oasis. In the span of a little over a mile on a single avenue in the tony Orlando suburb of Winter Park, there are two Publix supermarkets, a Trader Joe\u2019s, a Chamberlin\u2019s Natural Food Market and the site of a future 40,000-square-foot Whole Foods Market. With the exception of Chamberlin\u2019s, where the offerings are mostly organic or specialized, prices in the food oasis are cheaper than what Riggins gets in his neighborhood, and the selections are boundless by comparison.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Grocery chains leave food deserts barren, AP analysis finds", "title": "Grocery chains leave food deserts barren, AP analysis finds", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Grocery chains leave food deserts barren, AP analysis finds", "title": "Grocery chains leave food deserts barren, AP analysis finds", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/12/07/grocery_chains_leave_food_deserts_barren_ap_analysis_finds/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/12/hungry-for-supermarkets.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Grocery chains leave food deserts barren, AP analysis finds", "title": "Grocery chains leave food deserts barren, AP analysis finds", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/12/hungry-for-supermarkets.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Mike Schneider", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "\u2014 As the largest supermarket chains have been slow to build in food deserts, dollar stores have multiplied rapidly.\nThree chains \u2014 Dollar General, Family Dollar and Dollar Tree \u2014 made up two-thirds of new stores in food deserts.\nBut the AP\u2019s research demonstrates that major grocers overwhelmingly avoid America\u2019s food deserts instead of trying to turn a profit in high-poverty areas.\nThe AP analyzed which of the new stores that opened lie directly within food deserts.\nOn top of all that, it\u2019s difficult to say how many more people live in newer food deserts created by recent store closures."}
