Boehner and the House Democratic leader, Nancy Pelosi, would repeal a Medicare formula that threatens to cut doctors\u2019 fees each year. In its place, Congress would establish an \u201cincentive payment system\u201d to reward doctors who receive high performance scores from the government. Scores would be based on factors like the ability to keep patients healthy while controlling costs.\n\nPassage of the legislation would be a significant accomplishment for Mr. Boehner. It would eliminate the need for Congress to go through contortions to set Medicare payment rates for physicians, an annual exercise informally known as the \u201cdoc fix.\u201d\n\nRepresentative Michael C. Burgess, Republican of Texas and chief sponsor of the bill, said, \u201cIt removes the imminent threat of draconian cuts to Medicare providers that have created uncertainty for millions of beneficiaries.\u201d\n\nMs. Pelosi said she was pleased with the results of her unusual collaboration with the speaker. \u201cIt\u2019s not a \u2018doc fix,\u2019 \u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a fix for America\u2019s seniors so that they can continue to see their doctor under Medicare.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe bill hit a snag in the Senate at the end of last week. Some Democrats expressed concern about an unrelated provision of the bill that would impose restrictions on abortions at community health centers. Ms. Pelosi tried to tamp down the concern, telling Democrats that the restrictions represented \u201cno change in current policy.\u201d\n\nWithout action by Congress, doctors face a 21 percent cut in Medicare payments on April 1. On 17 occasions in the last 12 years, Congress has passed legislation to block such cuts without fundamentally changing the payment formula. Removing the threat of future cuts has been a top goal of lobbyists for the American Medical Association and other doctor groups.\n\nThe changes are part of a package estimated to cost $200 billion over 10 years, lawmakers said. The legislation would offset about $70 billion of the cost, with roughly half of the savings coming from higher costs for some Medicare beneficiaries and half from lower reimbursements to health care providers like hospitals and nursing homes.\n\nHouse leaders have not identified a way to pay the remaining $130 billion. Most of that expense could be added to the budget deficit, a prospect that dismays fiscal conservatives.\n\nThe proposals have touched off a frenzy of lobbying by health care providers and consumer groups. Dr. Austin I. King, president of the Texas Medical Association, announced \u201ca massive grass-roots campaign to demand that Congress pass this bill.\u201d\n\nLobbying groups for older Americans, including the AARP and the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, denounced the plan, saying it put too much of a financial burden on patients.\n\nMr. Boehner described the new costs for beneficiaries as \u201cmodest bipartisan changes \u2014 structural reforms\u201d that would strengthen Medicare and save money in the long run.\n\nOne proposal would require higher-income Medicare beneficiaries to pay higher premiums for coverage of prescription drugs and doctors\u2019 services. Another would require some new beneficiaries to pay more of the out-of-pocket costs now covered by certain insurance policies that supplement Medicare.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe supplemental policies reduce the need for consumers to worry about deductibles and co-payments. As a result, critics say, patients use more services, driving up Medicare costs and premiums for all beneficiaries.\n\nRepublicans have argued for years that Medicare beneficiaries would be more cost-conscious if they had more \u201cskin in the game.\u201d House Republican leaders said President Obama\u2019s latest budget request included similar proposals to make some beneficiaries pay more.\n\nHowever, some conservatives do not like the deal worked out by Mr. Boehner and Ms. Pelosi.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not very excited about the bill,\u201d said Representative Ra\u00fal R. Labrador, Republican of Idaho. \u201cAt the same time we\u2019re saying as Republicans that we\u2019re going to balance the budget in 10 years, we\u2019re going to add $120 billion or $130 billion to the deficit, and that seems incongruous to me.\u201d\n\nRepresentative Tim Huelskamp, Republican of Kansas, said: \u201cI find it very disagreeable that somehow a fix means we just add it to the debt. That\u2019s the fix? That\u2019s not a fix. That\u2019s the same old Washington way of doing things that\u2019s been going on under both parties for decades. That\u2019s why we have $18 trillion in debt.\u201d\n\nThe current Medicare formula, established under laws passed in 1989 and 1997, reduces payments to doctors whenever spending for their services exceeds a goal, the \u201csustainable growth rate,\u201d linked to the country\u2019s economic growth. Under the Boehner-Pelosi proposal, Medicare would increase payments to doctors by one-half of 1 percent a year through 2019. Starting in 2019, doctors would receive bonuses or penalties, depending on their performance.\n\nWhen Congress passed the Affordable Care Act in 2010, making coverage widely available, some lawmakers said it would reduce the need for the separate insurance program for children. Congress provided money for the program only through Sept. 30 of this year.\n\nBut researchers have found that private health plans sold on the new insurance exchanges do not meet the needs of children as effectively as the federal program, known as CHIP, which covers eight million children for at least part of the year. The private plans typically cover fewer services for children and pay for less of the costs.\n\nUnless Congress provides additional money, the National Governors Association said in a letter to lawmakers last month, \u201cmore than two million children could lose access to the services they need to thrive.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Boehner and Ms. Pelosi have agreed to provide money for the children\u2019s insurance program for two more years. Advocates for children and Senate Democrats said that was not enough; they want a four-year extension, which Mr. Obama also supports.\n\n\u201cHow do we leave here taking care of the doctors permanently and shortchanging children, giving them only two years of health insurance?\u201d asked Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio.\n\nSenate Democrats have all endorsed a bill by Mr. Brown to provide money for CHIP through 2019.
