These opponents say Congress should take action to block the agreement, and say that Congress should instead impose more economic sanctions until Iran makes more concessions on its nuclear program.\n\nSupporters of the agreement say it is the best and most realistic way to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon. The deal will make the United States and its allies safer because it cuts off Iran's pathways to nuclear weapons. The only real alternative to this agreement would be military action and American involvement in another Middle Eastern war. These supporters say that Congress should allow the agreement to go forward and then closely monitor its implementation.\n\nHaving heard both sides, who do you agree with more--the opponents who say the agreement to limit Iran's nuclear program is not strong enough and Congress should block it, or the supporters who say the agreement is the best and most realistic way to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon?", "article_metadata": {"description": "WASHINGTON -- Americans mostly approve of the outline of the Iran nuclear deal and don't want Congress to block it, according to a poll released Friday....", "sailthru.expire_date": "2015-04-11 08:27:41 -0400", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "WASHINGTON -- Americans mostly approve of the outline of the Iran nuclear deal and don't want Congress to block it, according to a poll released Friday....", "title": "Poll: Americans Don't Want Congress To Crush Iran Deal", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/04/10/iran-nuclear-deal-poll_n_7039700.html", "image": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2822748/images/o-IRAN-NUCLEAR-facebook.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "WASHINGTON -- Americans mostly approve of the outline of the Iran nuclear deal and don't want Congress to block it, according to a poll released Friday....", "title": "Poll: Americans Don't Want Congress To Crush Iran Deal", "image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2822748/images/o-IRAN-NUCLEAR-facebook.jpg", "height": 1000}, "creator": "mmcauliff", "site": "@HuffPostPol", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-04-10 08:27:41 -0400", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=7039700", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "iran nuclear deal,iran,iran nuclear talks,president obama,iran nuclear deal poll,poll,iran poll,congress iran deal,iran deal,Iran Nuclear,iran deal poll", "article": {"section": "Politics", "tag": "iran nuclear deal,iran,iran nuclear talks,president obama,iran nuclear deal poll,poll,iran poll,congress iran deal,iran deal,Iran Nuclear,iran deal poll", "published_time": "2015-04-10 08:27:41 -0400", "modified_time": "2015-04-10 08:59:01 -0400"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd08ea\"", "article_summary": "WASHINGTON -- Americans mostly approve of the outline of the Iran nuclear deal and don't want Congress to block it, according to a poll released Friday.\nThese opponents say Congress should take action to block the agreement, and say that Congress should instead impose more economic sanctions until Iran makes more concessions on its nuclear program.\nThese supporters say that Congress should allow the agreement to go forward and then closely monitor its implementation.\nSupporters of the agreement say it is the best and most realistic way to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon.\nThe deal will make the United States and its allies safer because it cuts off Iran's pathways to nuclear weapons."}
