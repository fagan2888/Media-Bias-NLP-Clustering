Congressional budget negotiators have reached a tentative agreement on a $1 trillion spending package that would fund most agencies through the end of fiscal 2016, USA Today reported Tuesday.

Erin Kelly writes government funding will expire at Wednesday midnight and House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) has said members of Congress could vote on a bill Wednesday to extend spending authority through Dec. 22.

U.S. lawmakers aim to finalize the details of full-year omnibus budget before they adjourn this month.

Democrats agreed to Republicansâ€™ policy rider to lift the crude oil export ban in exchange for a five-year tax credit extension for solar and wind energy projects, Kelly reports.

The omnibus includes a measure to tighten restrictions on travelers from visa-waiver countries who have visited Iraq, Syria, Sudan or Iran in the past five years, the report said.

The New York Times reported negotiators also agreed tentatively to revise certain elements of the Affordable Care Act and to extend financial assistance for emergency workers who responded to the Sept. 11 terror attacks.

Negotiators also plan to make research and development tax credits for businesses permanent, according to the story by David Herszenhorn and Robert Pear.

A report on The Hill newspaper says the spending bill contains provision to require officials at the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development to turn over federal records at the end of their tenure.
