About a dozen presidential candidates or possible candidates were expected to participate in the conference. (Alex Wong/Getty Images)\n\nGeorgia Secretary of State Brian P. Kemp sat at his state\u2019s GOP convention this month and listened to not one, not two, but three potential presidential contenders. He turned to the guy next to him, who has been involved in state politics for decades, and asked: When was the last time the convention attracted even one major presidential contender?\n\n\u201cHe said: \u2018Maybe Goldwater?\u2019 \u201d Kemp recalled, reaching back to the 1964 election.\n\nTo Kemp, the arrival of Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie that Friday was a sign that the South is becoming more relevant in the selection of a Republican nominee.\n\nThat is especially true for 2016, as Kemp spearheads an effort to have a half-dozen or more Southern states hold their primaries on March 1 \u2014 right on the heels of the first-in-the-nation contests in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina. Kemp calls it the \u201cSEC primary,\u201d a nod to the collegiate Southeastern Conference.\n\nSuch a primary could be an opportunity for a conservative candidate to rack up delegates early, especially with such a crowded GOP field and an infusion of super PAC money that could keep campaigns alive longer. It also could have a profound effect on the eventual nominee, increasing the odds that candidates take harder-line stands to appeal to conservative Southern voters.\n\nThe primary has yet to collect as many states as the celebrated college sports conference, however. Most Southern states hold their presidential primaries in late spring and require legislative action to change the date.\n\nIn addition, critics say, the change comes with logistical hurdles and expenses and would give local candidates in down-ballot races less time to launch their campaigns. There is also no promise that a concentration of primaries will produce a rush of visiting politicians or a definitive message from the region.\n\nGeorgia is on track for a March 1 primary, as Kemp has the unusual power of being able to set the date himself. Alabama, Tennessee, Oklahoma and Virginia are also likely to join. (Yes, Kemp knows that two of those states are not members of the SEC, but just roll with it. Another suggested name: the Waffle House Primary.)\n\nEven if all of the states\u2019 primaries are not on the same day, there is likely to be a flurry of Southern primaries around that time: North Carolina will probably go right before the group in late February, while Louisiana will probably stick with the first Saturday in March, soon after the SEC primary. Powerhouses Texas and Florida, however, are likely to wait until later in March.\n\nMississippi is likely to opt for a March 8 primary because some lawmakers worried about getting lost in the crowd on March 1. Arkansas lawmakers are headed into a short special session this week and could take up the issue \u2014 although some worry that presidential candidates will not visit no matter when the primary is held, given the state\u2019s ties to former governor Mike Huckabee and Democratic front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like herding cats,\u201d said Josh Putnam, a visiting assistant professor of political science at Appalachian State University who tracks these legislative moves on the blog Frontloading HQ.\n\nStrategists say a Southern primary has the potential to buoy a more conservative candidate and be a challenge for candidates considered too moderate or too affiliated with the establishment \u2014 such as Jeb Bush, who will not denounce the loathed Common Core education standards and has taken a more moderate stance on immigration.\n\nSeveral Southern states have high rates of poverty and could benefit from an infusion of jobs, although Republicans in the region also like to rail against social welfare programs, and Obamacare is still wildly unpopular. There are worries about terrorism and a desire for an aggressive commander in chief. Evangelical voters are also a major force and are looking for a candidate who will not back down in opposing gay marriage and abortion.\n\nTo many Southerners, such views are not to the right of the party \u2014 they think those stances should be at the heart of the party.\n\n\u201cI consider myself the base. I don\u2019t consider myself ultra-conservative,\u201d said Lou Ann Cushman, a politically active 65-year-old from Evening Shade, Ark., who attended the Southern Republican Leadership Conference in Oklahoma City in the past week.\n\nHardly anyone there mentioned the SEC primary without prompting. Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin \u2014 who likes to boast that Obama twice lost all 77 counties in her state \u2014 was unaware that a concentrated primary was taking shape for March 1 and that her state is lined up to be part of it.\n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s our primary?\u201d she asked, as one of her aides rushed to Google it on his phone. \u201cWe\u2019re February, aren\u2019t we?\u201d\n\nThe would-be candidates who appeared at the conference tailored their pitches for the South. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker \u2014 who has been known to drop a few \u201cy\u2019alls\u201d into his speeches \u2014 called for repealing Obamacare. Cruz, who is strategically targeting the second round of primary states, had been scheduled to headline a Friday-night gala. Former Hewlett-Packard chief executive Carly Fiorina had Saturday-morning brunch with Republican women. Volunteers for Ben Carson, a retired neurosurgeon, handed out hundreds of copies of a book he wrote.\n\nThe biggest SEC primary cheerleader among the candidates thus far is Huckabee, who plans to campaign aggressively in the South.\n\n\u201cI think that idea is a gift from God. I think it was inspired out of heaven,\u201d Huckabee said in an interview with GaPundit.com in January as he promoted his book, \u201cGod, Guns, Grits and Gravy.\u201d \u201cIt is the Southern states and the Midwestern states that really form the bulk of the presidential genesis in November. . . . If a Republican doesn\u2019t carry the heartland, he\u2019s not going to win.\u201d\n\nBut if the South builds an SEC primary, will candidates show up? Or will the attention still go to the biggest states or purplest states?\n\n\u201cNo one can really afford a 50-state strategy anymore,\u201d said Angie Maxwell, director of the Diane D. Blair Center of Southern Politics and Society at the University of Arkansas. \u201cThe truth is, the strategists don\u2019t need the South. . . . The Republican Party is going to get the South, no matter who the nominee is. That\u2019s not a danger. I mean, they voted for a millionaire Mormon.\u201d\n\nThe last time there was this sort of early Southern primary was 1988, when Democrats still controlled the region. The goal was to boost a moderate Democrat, such as then-Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, who could be more competitive in the general election. Instead, Al Gore won five of the states and Jesse Jackson took the other five. The same could happen for the Republicans in 2016, strategists caution.\n\nBut Kemp remains hopeful: \u201cThe South is the new heartland of America. The road to the White House should run through the South.\u201d\n\nKatie Zezima contributed to this report.\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that Sen.
