S. Supreme Court speaks and rules from a position of common law \u2014 human law, and operating under a measure of authority to govern, in America theirs is the highest rule of law that humans can make. Yet the rule of the USSC is not the final word.In the end, natural law, God's law will always trump common law. Do not fear or be confused or deceived. Remain prayerful. Keep looking up. God will have the final word in this matter.Therefore I must encourage listeners in this manner: \"Don\u2019t be misled \u2014 you cannot mock the justice of God. You will always harvest what you plant\u201d (Galatians 6:7 NLT).\u201cLet not your heart faint, and be not fearful at the report heard in the land, when a report comes in one year and afterward a report in another year, and violence is in the land, and ruler is against ruler\u201d (Jeremiah 51:46 ESV).As to the decisions before us regarding the HHS mandate, in contrast to God\u2019s law, the civil laws and common laws of nations are not written on anyone\u2019s conscience or mind.They are not written in the physical creation. Nor are they appended to the Bible. The civil laws of nations are only written in their own law books.Consequently, the validity and force of such laws are based solely on national authority. There is no other supporting evidence or \u201cwitness\u201d to testify to the validity of specific civil laws.Consequently, in order for the civil laws of any nation to be authoritative, they must at least be supported by the testimony of another source, and that they are consistent with God\u2019s delegation of authority to civil governments.This is more thoroughly explained in Romans 13: \u201cLet every soul be in subjection to the higher powers: for there is no power but of God; and the powers that be are ordained of God. Therefore he that resisteth the power, withstandeth the ordinance of God: and they that withstand shall receive to themselves judgment.\"For rulers are not a terror to the good work, but to the evil. And wouldest thou have no fear of the power? do that which is good, and thou shalt have praise from the same: Wherefore ye must needs be in subjection, not only because of the wrath, but also for conscience\u2019 sake.\"Render to all their dues: tribute to whom tribute is due; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honor to whom honor. Owe no man anything, save to love one another: for he that loveth his neighbor hath fulfilled the law.\"For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not murder, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not covet, and if there be any other commandment, it is summed up in this word, namely, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. Love worketh no ill to his neighbor: love therefore is the fulfilment of the law\u201d (Romans 13:1-3, 5, 7-10 ASV).In order for the laws of a nation to be valid, they must at the very least harmonize with, and not contradict, the law of God.We know the law of God by looking to its expressions. If the laws of a nation conflict with one of the expressions of the law of God, then something is amiss. Or, perhaps we do not understand one or the other clearly.Unfortunately for women, the HHS mandate does not conform to this formula which is why I stand with Priests for Life.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Healthcare Reform, Religion", "pubdate": "2015-11-18T13:36:41", "og": {"site_name": "Newsmax", "description": "We know the law of God by looking to its expressions.
