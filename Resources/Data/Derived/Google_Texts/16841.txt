"Now, as soon as a bill hits the floor, you've got five guys ready to filibuster it. Whatever happened to foreplay?"

According to the Daily Show, Republicans losing faith in Paul Ryan is akin to Playboy magazine dropping nudity.

On Tuesday's episode, host Trevor Noah pointed out that the party was having trouble finding someone to step in as speaker of the House, with some conservatives finding Ryan to be too much of a moderate for the job.

"So it turns out that all the years of fighting Obamacare, trying to privatize Medicaid and massively cut domestic spending — that was all a cover," Noah said. "Well-played, Congressman — or should I say, 'Well-played, Comrade.' "

Correspondent Jessica Williams offered the following explanation for the party's change of heart: "It's simple. Paul Ryan is getting Playboy'd."

"It used to be that if you were looking to see pictures of naked ladies, Playboy knew what turned you on, like in the same way that Paul Ryan was the clean-cut conservative boy next door who used to excite Republicans," she continued. "But the times have changed!"

Noah pointed out that younger Republicans are now "getting all their ideas about how Washington works off the Internet."

"Right, and once you start going down that hardcore road, you need to get crazier and crazier just to get the same thrill," Williams replied. "Now, as soon as a bill hits the floor, you've got five guys ready to filibuster it. Whatever happened to foreplay?"
