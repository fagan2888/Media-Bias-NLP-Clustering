Suffice it to say POLITICO\u2019s own Katie Jennings can actually sing, Jon Bramnick slayed when he filled in for Christie with the final speech, and lots of talented (well, some talented) members of the New Jersey press corps, as usual, somehow managed to put together a good show with little time or resources.\n\nOn an unrelated note, Donald Trump\u2019s New Jersey rally/Christie campaign debt fundraiser is tonight in Lawrenceville.\n\nQUOTE OF THE DAY: \u201cI\u2019ll be a fiscal conservative, but generous to you.\u201d \u2014 Bramnick to (unbeknownst to him at the time) Miss New Jersey during a \u201cDating Game\u201d segment at the show, describing what his first 100 days as governor would like like.\n\nHAPPY BIRTHDAY: Democratic campaign operative Jenny Davis, former Old Tappan Mayor Victor Polce.

Still, an image emerged of a financial situation that would require immediate attention and likely complicate budget negotiations over the next six weeks, adding to a long list of lofty debates playing out in backrooms across the statehouse.\u201d http://politi.co/1quLql5\n\n\u2014\u201cChristie misses tax-revenue estimate, blows $600M hole in current budget,\u201d by NJ Spotlight\u2019s John Reitmeyer: \u201cFor Christie, the last-minute revisions to his budget are all the more difficult since most of the spending has already occurred at this point in the fiscal year.Only 2014\u2019s $1 billion gap was larger than the one being confronted in 2016, and the latest forecast revisions are raising new concerns among lawmakers about the possibility of another state credit-rating downgrade. It also remains to be seen how the now-shaky fiscal picture will impact talks among legislators who are trying to find a way to renew the state\u2019s tapped-out Transportation Trust Fund.\u201d http://bit.ly/209EWUN\n\n\u2014 \"Treasurer suggests delaying payment schedule for BEIP tax credits\u201d http://politi.co/1WEQv8q\n\n\u2014OLS budget officer Frank Haines remarks: http://bit.ly/22g9dDb\n\n\u2014Treasurer Ford Scudder\u2019s remarks and updated revenue tables: http://bit.ly/1NyrTLS\n\nAC \u2014 \u201cIs today the day Atlantic City gets its rescue plan?\u201d by NJ Advance Media\u2019s Brent Johnson: \u201cThursday could be the day state lawmakers finally unveil a final plan to keep Atlantic City from becoming the first New Jersey municipality in nearly 80 years to go bankrupt.

The 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia delayed the release of the list on Tuesday and set a June 6 hearing. The court announced Wednesday that judges Thomas Ambro, Kent Jordan and Anthony Scirica will hear 15 minutes of arguments from a group of media organizations including The Associated Press and from a lawyer representing an anonymous person on the list seeking to block its release.\u201d http://bit.ly/1quojHh\n\n\u2014\u201cBridgegate: Key dates in ongoing legal battle over release of names\u201d http://bit.ly/1XAoMVN\n\nHAS TRUMP NOT OFFERED TO PAY? \u2014 \u201cN.J. taxpayers still footing the bill for Christie's political travel,\u201d by The Record\u2019s Dustin Racioppi: \u201cGovernor Christie has curtailed his out-of-state travel since dropping out of the Republican race for the White House earlier this year, but taxpayers are still getting the bills for his security detail. Earlier this month Christie\u2019s administration billed $170,116 for the cost of his Executive Protection Unit, a legally required, round-the-clock security service provided by the State Police, for the first three months of the year. Christie dropped out of the race on Feb. 10 after placing sixth in the New Hampshire primary.\u201d http://bit.ly/1qvmLwP\n\nTHE TACO SALAD TWEET DIDN\u2019T SMOOTH THINGS OVER? \u2014 \u201cWill Trump face unhappy Hispanics at first New Jersey campaign stop?\u201d from WHYY\u2019s NewsWorks: \u201cTrump and Gov. Chris Christie will appear at the Lawrenceville National Guard Armory for a combined rally and fundraiser. Lawrenceville, just north of Trenton, is in Mercer County, where the population is about 15 percent Latino. Trump\u2019s remarks about building a border wall to stop \u2018rapists\u2019 from Mexico entering the United States appear to have energized Latinos to register to vote, and polls show almost 90 percent do not like Trump. Amner Deleon, a lawyer and Democratic activist in Princeton, told WHYY-FM in Philadelphia he is encouraging everyone he meets to register to vote. \u2018He has alienated not only the Latinos but the women, the Muslims, and pretty much anyone in the immigrant community,\u2019 Deleon said.\u201d http://bit.ly/209FtGz\n\nPARKS AND RECORRUPTION \u2014 \u201cKevin Bannon pressured county workers to attend Hughes\u2019 fundraiser, employee says,\" by The Trentonian\u2019s David Foster: Mercer County Park Commission Executive Director Kevin Bannon played a major role in fundraising for his boss \u2014 possibly a little too much. According to an email obtained by The Trentonian, Bannon contacted Mercer County employees about attending a fundraiser he put on for county Executive Brian Hughes in September at the Park Commission\u2019s Boathouse at Mercer Lake. \u2018I hope you will consider joining us for a fun-filled evening to support Brian Hughes for County Executive. Brian has been such a supporter of our parks and open space over the years. This is simply a fun evening of great food, music and drink to celebrate our wonderful Park Commission and support Brian\u2019s bid for a fourth term as County Executive. Please help by attending, bringing some guests and purchasing some tickets. Thank you!\u2019 the email reads that was sent on July 28 at 4:50 p.m. It is unclear if the email entitled \u201cPlease join us for fun event!\u201d was sent from Bannon\u2019s work email or while he was on the clock. But one Mercer County Park Commission employee, who wished to remain anonymous for fear of retribution, said he received this message on \u2018at least three different occasions.\u2019\u201d http://bit.ly/209DhPe\n\nLITTLE LIMA \u2014 \u201cWhy Paterson, New Jersey, is famous in Lima, Peru,\u201d by The Atlantic\u2019s Maria-Pia Negro Chin: \u201cGuillermo Callegari Balarezo first came here on a Saturday morning in August of 1962, carrying only one bag. He arrived at a time when, he says, \u201cthere were about 11 Peruvians in Paterson.\u201d One of those 11 was supposed to pick him up, but after some time passed, he went into a Puerto Rican restaurant to ask if there were any Peruvians around. \u2018They are coming,\u2019 was the response \u2026 The influx of Peruvians to Paterson persisted and grew such that, decades after Callegari\u2019s arrival, the city is now home to 10,000 Peruvians, by the Census Bureau\u2019s count. Community leaders say that the number is closer to 30,000, and that the exact Peruvian population in Paterson is hard to determine because many don\u2019t participate in the Census and many check \u201cother\u201d on their form because of their diverse backgrounds.\u201d http://theatln.tc/1XAromx\n\nGOT OUR EISENBERG ON YOU \u2014 \u201cTrump campaign forms fund-raising alliance with RNC, NJ GOP,\u201d by The Record\u2019s Herb Jackson: \u201cDonald Trump has signed on to creating a new political fund that can accept up to $449,400 per donor, an amount that would have been illegal in the 2012 election, by uniting his campaign with the Republican National Committee and 11 state organizations, including New Jersey\u2019s. The fund will be run by a one-time chairman of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, Lewis Eisenberg, who is finance chairman of the RNC and once held a similar post for the New Jersey Republican State Committee.\u201d http://bit.ly/1quICo0\n\nSWEENEY 2017 \u2014 \u201cOINK OINK OINK OINK!,\u201d by PolitickerNJ\u2019s Jay Lassiter: \u201cOnce in a while, a political figure slips up and gives us a proper glimpse at how politics really gets done in New Jersey. They accidentally go and divulge something dishy. That\u2019s what Ocean County GOP Chairman George Gilmore did earlier this year when he addressed the Ocean County Republican Committee: \u2013 \u2018I don\u2019t think this is any secret, that I can\u2019t say it: I have spoken with Senator Sweeney, the president of the Senate, who has assured me that (Ocean County Freeholder) Jack Kelly\u2019s nomination to the parole board will be heard by the Judiciary Committee and will be voted upon by the Senate and that we\u2019ll be happy with the results of both of those,; \u2013 Just about everything that\u2019s wrong with New Jersey politics is embedded in that one innocuous-sounding statement: 1) poor judgment + arrogance in Trenton 2) a jaw-dropping disregard for actual democracy and 3) political patronage that drives our state\u2019s colossally high property taxes.\u201d http://bit.ly/1quHYH2\n\nDOWN THE SHORE \u2014 \u201cAt the shore, help is wanted. Really wanted,\u201d by The Press of Atlantic City\u2019s Martin DeAngelis: \u201cNeil Parish needs to hire 30 or 35 people for a new restaurant he plans to open in Margate in time for Memorial Day weekend. But he\u2019s just a fraction of the way toward that goal after a month of hunting for workers. He didn\u2019t think that would be such a problem given what he knows about the Atlantic City area these days \u2026 With businesses by the hundreds opening up or gearing up for another summer at the South Jersey shore, obviously not every employer is having such a hard time finding help. But other bosses, even at long-established companies, have been surprised this year by seeing fewer people applying for jobs than they\u2019ve had in the past. Denise Beckson, operations and human resources director at Morey\u2019s Piers in the Wildwoods, said applications this year were off 14 percent from this time last year. \u2018This year, we\u2019ve definitely seen a decrease in the number of seasonal applications for our positions from the last three or four years,\u2019 said Beckson\u201d http://bit.ly/1qunn5S\n\nBECAUSE DONALD TRUMP IS A 1ST AMENDMENT CHAMPION \u2014 \u201cTrump flags keep flying after charges dropped,\u201d by The Asbury Park Press\u2019 Kathleen Hopkins: \u201cOCEAN TOWNSHIP - Joseph Hornick will be able to fly his Donald Trump political flags at his West Long Branch home without retribution, after the borough municipal prosecutor on Wednesday dismissed a summons alleging he violated an ordinance. \u2018I got justice today, and the First Amendment has won,\u2019 Joseph Hornick said as he left West Long Branch Municipal Court, which holds its sessions at the Ocean Township municipal complex. Hornick, 54, a longtime West Long Branch resident, has been flying Trump political flags at his Cedar Avenue home since February, but was cited in March under a borough ordinance that restricts the time frame during which political signs can be displayed \u2026 At Hornick\u2019s court appearance on the summons, Gerald Massell, West Long Branch\u2019s municipal prosecutor, said he was dismissing the complaint, saying the ordinance pertains to political signs, not flags.\u201d http://on.app.com/1qunuhM\n\nCOLD CASE THAWED \u2014 \u201cMichelle Lodzinski guilty of murdering son Timmy Wiltsey,\u201d by NJ Advance Media\u2019s Ted Sherman and Sue Epstein: \u201cAlmost a quarter century after five-year-old Timothy Wiltsey disappeared, his mother was found guilty of his murder today in a dramatic end to one of New Jersey's most notorious cold cases. A jury of seven men and five women convicted Lodzinski after eight weeks of testimony before Middlesex County Superior Court Judge Dennis Nieves in New Brunswick. They deliberated just four hours after the foreman was replaced Tuesday with an alternate because of an undisclosed \u2018personal matter.\u2019 Lodzinski, 48, a former South Amboy resident, had long denied she had anything to do with her son's death. She said Timothy went missing on May 25, 1991, when she went to get a soda while the pair were attending a carnival in nearby Sayreville.\u201d http://bit.ly/24ZU9v2\n\nWHY WOULD THEY WANT TO? \u2014 \u201cBramnick: Let the League of Women Voters handle redistricting in N.J.,\u201d by POLITICO\u2019s Matt Friedman: \u201cWith Democrats reviving an effort to change how New Jersey redraws its state legislative districts, Assembly Republican Leader Jon Bramnick is suggesting taking it out of politicians\u2019 hands altogether. Bramnick on Wednesday floated the idea of allowing the non-partisan League of Women Voters to take on the important once-a-decade process. \u2018Over my last 30 years in politics, I have watched the League of Women Voters. They have been the most neutral organization I\u2019ve ever known.\u2019 Bramnick said in a phone interview. \u2018Every time they\u2019ve conducted debates, every time they\u2019ve put out literature, it\u2019s right down the middle.\u2019\u201d http://politi.co/1XAoYV8\n\nNJ TRANSIT: GOOD AT BEING PARALYZED, BUT NOT SO GOOD AT HELPING THE PARALYZED \u2014 \u201cDisabled lawyer fed up with N.J. para-transit system finds another way,\u201d by NJ Advance Media\u2019s Susan K. Livio: \u201cCivil rights attorney Daniel Florio of Maplewood graduated last fall with a master's degree from the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University \u2013 an achievement he hoped would open many doors leading to a promising career. Turns out, his hard work was far from over. Born with spinal muscular atrophy, Florio is a quadriplegic who operates a motorized wheelchair by remote control using his thumb \u2026 Returning to New Jersey, Florio knew he could not even begin looking for work until he figured out how to cope with the grueling commute on Access Link, a paratransit network of vans that runs parallel to the bus services offered by NJ Transit \u2026 The ADA expects paratransit trips to be \u2018comparable\u2019 in length to regular bus service, a term that allows an Access Link trip to be 1-1/2 times longer. Florio said the service routinely is three times as long under a rule that also allows drivers to arrive 20 minutes sooner or later than the requested pick-up time.\u2019\u201d http://bit.ly/24ZOOUz\n\nTRADE THEM FOR HAMILTON TICKETS \u2014 \u201cNew Jersey's Revolutionary War history unearthed,\u201d by NJ Advance Media\u2019s Mark Di Ionno: \u201cBill Styple pulled three artifact bags out of his pocket. One had a uniform button, one had a plain shoe buckle and one had a hunk of melted lead used to make round shot for muzzle-loaders. Nearby, his son, Brad, working with a metal detector and spade, unearthed a piece of flat, dirt-caked metal with a small hole punched through it. There are about 50 other similar pieces of hardware now in the hands of the Commonwealth Heritage Group, a national historic preservation consultant, which did the first archeological survey of this excavation site a few weeks ago.\u201d http://bit.ly/1XApouD\n\nDIVIDED \u2014 \u201cUnitedHealth Group exiting New Jersey Obamacare marketplace,\u201d by POLITICO\u2019s Katie Jennings: \u201cUnitedHealth Group is pulling out of New Jersey\u2019s Obamacare marketplace in 2017. The company\u2019s subsidiary Oxford Health Plans will stop offering individual plans on the state\u2019s federally facilitated health insurance marketplace, according to a letter from the state Department of Banking and Insurance. The letter was obtained by POLITICO through an Open Public Records Act request.\u201d http://politi.co/1XAsejf\n\nPUT ELEC ON IT.. OH, WAIT \u2014 \u201cMystery groups funneled attack fliers into Paterson's 6th Ward race,\u201d by The Paterson Press\u2019 Joe Malinconico: \u201cIn the final days of the acrimonious battle for the 6th Ward City Council seat, the two rivals got some last-minute support from attack fliers paid for by mystery groups. From left, Al Abdelaziz, Andre Sayegh From left, Al Abdelaziz, Andre Sayegh One blow was struck through a mailing that echoed incumbent councilman Andre Sayegh\u2019s oft-asserted accusations that his opponent, Al Abdelaziz, would be a \u2018rubber stamp\u2019 for Mayor Jose \u2018Joey\u2019 Torres. That piece of campaign literature says it was paid for by \u2018A Better New Jersey.\u2019 The other assault came in the form of a handbill that shows Sayegh\u2019s face on the body of a rat with the caption, \u2018Everyone hates a snitch.\u201d\u2019The political literature offers no explanation for calling Sayegh a \u2018snitch.\u2019 It simply says, \u2018Paid for by the CCP.\u2019\u201d http://bit.ly/1quI9lV\n\nMAYBE THE CURRENT STRUCTURE CAN QUALIFY FOR THE NJ REGISTER OF HISTORIC PLACES \u2014 \u201cAmerican Dream developer says getting financing done is critical for on-site work to resume,\u201d by The Record\u2019s Linda Moss and John Brennan: \u201cThe developer of American Dream Meadowlands, the huge shopping and entertainment complex, said that getting the project's financing done is critical for on-site work to resume. Still, on Wednesday it remained unclear how quickly Canadian mall developer Triple Five will secure the necessary state approvals for its change in plans regarding the issuance of $1 billion in bonds to help pay for completion of the long-stalled project.\u201d http://bit.ly/209FUR6\n\nDEMOCRATS: \u2018SURE, JON.

A Central Jersey lawmaker thinks it's time to become a one-plate state. There are 19 states that don't require front license plates, which also includes neighboring Delaware.

The board will call in Pat Politano of Strategic Message Management \u2014 who previously did consulting for mayor-backed board members' political campaigns \u2014 to handle public affairs for the district on an at-need basis.
