Wanting Trump out of the Republican presidential race is not the same thing as proclaiming Ted Cruz an acceptable alternative. He manifestly is not. If a Trump presidency would be a disaster, a Cruz administration would be apocalyptic.\n\nIn this Grand Guignol presidential election season, Cruz, the Texas senator, has enjoyed the benefit of running against a bellicose balloon float kept aloft by racism, misogyny, and Islamophobia. Trump\u2019s say-anything long con has sucked up most of the media attention, including a boatload of negative advertising.\n\nMeanwhile, too few people are paying attention to Cruz as he racks up states and delegates. At present, Trump has 743 delegates to Cruz\u2019s 545, but there are still 854 delegates up for grabs, giving Cruz time to further slice into Trump\u2019s once-commanding lead.\n\nAt the most hotly anticipated show of the summer, the Republican National Convention, there is a chance that Cruz, with the reticent support of his reluctant party, could emerge as the nominee.\n\nAnd while it would be a delight to see Trump trumped, that merriment would be short-lived with Cruz one step closer to possibly becoming the leader of this nation.\n\nWith his archaic views, ill-informed grasp of civil rights, and noxious ambition, Cruz shouldn\u2019t be allowed any closer to the Oval Office than a White House tour.\n\nThis is a man whose crowning achievement has been the 2013 government shutdown, which he engineered to force President Obama and the Democrat-led Senate to gut the Affordable Care Act.

In the case of Cruz, then a freshman senator and a Tea Party darling, it was about juicing his national profile in preparation for the presidential run he is now inflicting on us.\n\nNo wonder his fellow Republicans, blamed for the shutdown, are loath to support a man willing to torch his party and country in order to further his own career.\n\nUnlike Trump, whose political viewpoints are as unsteady as a screen door in a hurricane, Cruz doesn\u2019t waver. He voted against reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act, wants to undercut abortion rights, and denounces marriage equality and LGBT protections.\n\nHe trumpets carpet-bombing ISIS, even though military leaders say that is neither a logical nor a moral option.
