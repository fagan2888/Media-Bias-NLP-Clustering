Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson warned Wednesday that the country could face another spike in illegal immigration as the U.S. economy picks up and as seasonal patterns change, though he said they have made major progress in combatting the surge of illegal immigrant children that wrong-footed his department earlier this year.

“We’re determined that we need to do more ourselves for border security,” Mr. Johnson said in a speech at the National Press Club sponsored by Democratic group NDN. “I’m concerned about the possibility of another rise in illegal migration.”

Mr. Johnson’s focus on border security is a change from his predecessor, former Secretary Janet Napolitano, a former Arizona governor who repeatedly said the border was secure.

This summer’s surge of illegal immigrant children and families from Central America exposed flaws in the current immigration enforcement system — particularly U.S. agencies’ inability to quickly deport many of them.

Mr. Johnson also predicted President Obama would take steps to boost border security as part of his planned unilateral action on immigration, which advocates hope will involve granting temporary amnesty to millions of illegal immigrants in the U.S. right now.
