Twenty other countries \u2014 from Australia to Cyprus to the United Kingdom \u2014 have also charged or arrested 70 alleged Darkode members.\n\n\u201cWe have dismantled a cyber hornets\u2019 nest of criminal hackers which was believed by many, including the hackers themselves, to be impenetrable,\u201d said David Hickton, the U.S attorney for the Western District of Pennsylvania.\n\nU.S. officials are claiming it as a major victory in their fight against the massive cyber crime rings that have rapidly proliferated over the last few years.\n\nLaw enforcement has struggled to pin down cyber crooks hiding behind anonymity software in far-flung countries.\n\n\u201cOf the roughly 800 criminal internet forums worldwide, Darkode represented one of the gravest threats to the integrity of data on computers in the United States and around the world,\u201d Hickton said.\n\nIn terms of scale, Wednesday's action ranks with a worldwide raid last fall that took down hundreds of black market websites hidden on the underground anonymous network Tor.\n\nThe DOJ said Darkode was a members-only forum where elite hackers not only bought and sold digital intrusion tools but also schemed and swapped tips. Those who wanted to join had to prove their worth by presenting unique or exemplary hacking skills or products.\n\n\u201cThis is a milestone,\u201d said FBI Deputy Director Mark Giuliano.\n\nSince taking office in April, Attorney General Loretta Lynch has publicly vowed to make tackling cyber crime one of her top priorities.\n\nWednesday\u2019s announcement is her department\u2019s biggest action to date on that front.\n\n\u201cThis operation is a great example of what international law enforcement can accomplish when we work closely together to neutralize a global cyber crime marketplace,\u201d said DOJ Assistant Attorney General Leslie Caldwell.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The government is claiming this as a major victory in its cyber crime fight.", "description": "The government is claiming this as a major victory in its cyber crime fight.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Cory Bennett", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The government is claiming this as a major victory in its cyber crime fight.", "title": "Feds take down elite hacking forum", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/247995-doj-reveals-takedown-of-elite-hacking-forum", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/biz_cybersecuritystory.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T03:39-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/247995-doj-reveals-takedown-of-elite-hacking-forum", "dcterms.date": "2015-07-15T11:00-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Cory Bennett", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-15T11:00:48-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/247995-doj-reveals-takedown-of-elite-hacking-forum", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The government is claiming this as a major victory in its cyber crime fight.", "card": "summary", "title": "Feds take down elite hacking forum"}, "dcterms.title": "Feds take down elite hacking forum"}, "article_summary": "The Justice Department said Wednesday it had taken down a hacking forum known as Darkode.\nThe government has filed criminal charges against 12 people allegedly affiliated with the forum, a dark Web repository for hacking tools of all kinds.\nThe DOJ said Darkode was a members-only forum where elite hackers not only bought and sold digital intrusion tools but also schemed and swapped tips.\nU.S. officials are claiming it as a major victory in their fight against the massive cyber crime rings that have rapidly proliferated over the last few years.\nSince taking office in April, Attorney General Loretta Lynch has publicly vowed to make tackling cyber crime one of her top priorities."}
