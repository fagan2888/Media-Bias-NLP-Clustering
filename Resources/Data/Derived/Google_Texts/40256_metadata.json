The first group of 11 scholars are sophomores. Applications opened during the end of last semester, and the only prerequisites for students to apply are two semesters of economics study.\n\nA major hurdle of implementing the certificate program is the fact that it has not yet been approved for students in the College of Arts and Sciences. The program organizers intended from its inception to include students from all four schools, but the School of Arts and Sciences has not yet approved the certificate, Assistant Director of Policy Research & Coordination Matthew Stengel said.\n\nRogers Smith, a Political Science professor closely involved in the process of approving the certificate for College students, said that during discussions last year, SAS faculty expressed interest in approving the program; however, questions remained as to what the structure and involvement of SAS faculty would be, and the decision was tabled.\n\n\u201cThere are further approvals that will be needed but I hope that the questions will get resolved during this fall,\u201d Smith said.\n\nThe curriculum for the certificate consists of eight classes. Students take \u201cIntro to Business Economics and Public Policy,\u201d two semesters of calculus or one semester of calculus and one semester of statistics and one of four courses in the Political Science Department focusing on policy. Then, students chose a policy track to delve into, such as education policy, healthcare policy or energy and environmental policy, in which they take three classes. Finally, students participate in a capstone course during the spring semester of their senior years in which they write a policy analysis of a current issue.\n\nStudents are required to complete one public policy internship, for which the program guarantees full funding, and are encouraged to do research related to their field of interest within public policy.\n\nThere are already opportunities within Penn\u2019s curriculum for students to study public policy. Wharton offers a business economics and public policy concentration, and the College offers a thematic concentration in policy and governance as part of the philosophy, politics and economics major, as well as an American public policy minor.\n\nHowever, the new certificate program is different from these courses of study because it allows students from across majors and undergraduate schools to integrate public policy into their own courses of study, as well as pursue a specific issue more in-depth. Additionally, the program helps students arrange research opportunities and internships.\n\n\u201cEverything we\u2019re doing, including the classes, are things that students could have pieced together themselves, but we\u2019re giving it direction, administrative support and funding,\u201d Stengel said.\n\nCollege and Wharton sophomore Emily Zhen heard about the Public Policy Research Scholars program during her summer internship in Washington, D.C. She decided to apply in part because she was inspired by the people she met while at the Department of Treasury.\n\nZhen will pursue the health or fiscal policy track in the certificate program. \u201cI think with the Affordable Care Act and all of the implementation there\u2019s so much to do career-wise with health policy and public health,\u201d she said.\n\nNursing sophomore Erin Hartman, the sole nurse in the certificate program currently, applied because although she wants to work in healthcare after she graduates, her academic passions lie in the realms of economics and political science. She was also inspired by her Nursing professor, Julie Sochalski, who worked on writing the Affordable Care Act, to explore a career in policy.\n\nHartman hopes that if she works in public policy, having a nursing degree will give her a better idea of what hospitals are really like and help her to better understand the realities of the United States healthcare system.\n\n\u201cPeople write policy, but don\u2019t necessarily see it in action,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The curriculum for the certificate consists of eight classes and a senior capstone course", "generator": "Gryphon 20160217001 (Foundry 6.1-20150615001)", "og": {"url": "http://www.thedp.com/article/2015/09/public-policy-research-scholars", "image": "http://d1q35ni5859stt.cloudfront.net/20160226Xkg5f5RbLb/dist/img/fb-hidden-icon.png", "type": "article", "description": "The curriculum for the certificate consists of eight classes and a senior capstone course", "title": "Wharton Public Policy Research Scholars program not open to College students"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6356558804}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8e00\"", "article_summary": "Pioneered by the Wharton Public Policy Initiative, Penn\u2019s hub for public policy, the Wharton Public Policy Research Scholars program lets students from the Wharton School, the School of Engineering and Applied Science and the School of Nursing add a public policy certificate to their degree.\nStudents are required to complete one public policy internship, for which the program guarantees full funding, and are encouraged to do research related to their field of interest within public policy.\nWharton offers a business economics and public policy concentration, and the College offers a thematic concentration in policy and governance as part of the philosophy, politics and economics major, as well as an American public policy minor.\nThen, students chose a policy track to delve into, such as education policy, healthcare policy or energy and environmental policy, in which they take three classes.\nThere are already opportunities within Penn\u2019s curriculum for students to study public policy."}
