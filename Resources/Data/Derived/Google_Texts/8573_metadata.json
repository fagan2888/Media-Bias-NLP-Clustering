Bob Murphy of the Monroe County Sheriff\u2019s Office.\n\nHasman had been flying touch-and-go exercises throughout the morning. He crashed as he descended from the north for either a touch-and-go or a landing at Hasman Field just northwest of the Greater Rochester International Airport, Murphy said.\n\n\u201cHe was doing what he loved,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cHe loved to fly.\u201d\n\nGusty winds may have contributed to the crash, but authorities have yet to officially determine the cause, Murphy said. The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating.\n\nA nearby business owner who saw the longtime pilot flying earlier called 911 just before 1 p.m. after noticing the plane turned upside down, Murphy said.\n\nThe veteran\u2019s family was notified and was comforted that Hasman died flying, which was his passion, the sergeant said.\n\nElsewhere in New York, a 79-year-old man near Buffalo was airlifted to a hospital after a single-engine plane he was flying crashed while taking off, authorities said.", "article_metadata": {"article_author": "The Associated Press", "medium": "news", "news_keywords": "'aviation','national-news','plane-crash'", "title": "Small plane crash kills World War II veteran who loved to fly", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Small plane crash kills World War II veteran who loved to fly\", \"link\": \"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2014/07/small_plane_crash_kills_world_war_ii_veteran_who_loved_to_fly.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/ledgerupdates_impact/photo/2014/07/05/15354379-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"13345244\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-07-05T23:08:01Z\", \"author\": \"The Associated Press\", \"tags\": [\"aviation\",\"national-news\",\"plane-crash\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.nj.com/ledgerupdates_impact/photo/2014/07/05/15354379-thumb_square_large.jpg", "description": "Single-engine plane crashed in an upstate New York airfield that bore the victim's name.", "card": "summary", "site": "@njdotcom"}, "article_date_updated": "Saturday, July 05, 2014,  7:07 PM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"image_url\": \"http://media.nj.com/ledgerupdates_impact/photo/2014/07/05/plane-crash-cessnajpg-9e5399e954735f33.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"njoapnews\", \"author_nickname\": \"The Associated Press\", \"author_id\": \"1828075\", \"source_blog_name\": \"New Jersey Real-Time News\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "NJ.com", "description": "Single-engine plane crashed in an upstate New York airfield that bore the victim's name.", "title": "Small plane crash kills World War II veteran who loved to fly", "url": "http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2014/07/small_plane_crash_kills_world_war_ii_veteran_who_loved_to_fly.html", "image": "http://media.nj.com/design/alpha/img/logo_njo.gif", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "NJ.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Saturday, July 05, 2014,  7:08 PM", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "Description": "Single-engine plane crashed in an upstate New York airfield that bore the victim's name."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9a98\"", "article_summary": "SPENCERPORT, N.Y. \u2014 An 88-year-old World War II veteran who loved to fly died today when his single-engine plane crashed in the upstate New York airfield that bore his name, authorities said.\n\u201cHe was doing what he loved,\u201d Murphy said.\nHasman had been flying touch-and-go exercises throughout the morning.\nElsewhere in New York, a 79-year-old man near Buffalo was airlifted to a hospital after a single-engine plane he was flying crashed while taking off, authorities said.\nThe veteran\u2019s family was notified and was comforted that Hasman died flying, which was his passion, the sergeant said."}
