Health and Human Services Secretary Aldona Wos in December it would suspend administrative funding if North Carolina didn\u2019t address the 20,000-plus backlog, sent another letter last week saying the department\u2019s best efforts to fix the problem weren\u2019t good enough.\n\nA copy of the letter was released by DHHS at 4:47 p.m. Friday.\n\nFrom Robin Bailey Jr. a regional administrator for USDA\u2019s Food and Nutritional Services (FNS), Jan. 23 letter to Wos:\n\n\u201cFNS is alarmed by the persistent problems despite our extensive technical assistance and repeated communications concerning the severity of the situation. Citizens of North Carolina that need help putting food on the table are not receiving the basic level of responsiveness and quality of service that they deserve from their government. Continued delays create undue hardship for the most vulnerable citizens of North Carolina.\n\nClick here to read the entire letter.\n\nThe letter sets a firm Feb. 10 date for state officials to have processed all the backlogged applications for people that are considered hardship cases, anyone waiting more than three months for food stamps and any recertification of food stamps that have been delayed more than 90 days.\n\nIf that Feb. 10 deadline isn\u2019t met, USDA will receive a formal warning that could lead to suspension of federal funding for state administrative costs.\n\nGetting better? DHHS says yes but USDA not so sure\n\nDHHS\u2019 Sherry Bradsher, who heads the state agency\u2019s public health division, released a statement saying the state agency was still working on the backlog, and was unhappy with the prospect of losing funding.\n\n\u201cWe strongly disagree with the federal government\u2019s threat to withhold Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) administrative funds, which could adversely impact counties\u2019 abilities to assist families in need,\u201d Bradsher wrote in a statement.\n\nDHHS backlog data from Jan. 7 showed that 39,000 households were waiting on Jan. 7 for the federally-funded food stamps, disturbed through a program called Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP.) That\u2019s up from the 20,000 household backlog that USDA called \u201cunacceptable\u201d in December.\n\nRevised North Carolina numbers on Jan. 21 showed a backlog of more than 23,000 but Bailey notes it was unclear if that decrease was because duplicative applications were removed, or if families that needed food were getting help. DHHS officials told lawmakers earlier this month that one reason for the high backlog was because there with duplicated applications.\n\nUSDA officials also didn\u2019t seem to buy Wos\u2019 explanation that the state agency\u2019s requirements under the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) implementation caused thousands of families to receive needed food stamps.\n\n\u201cIt should be noted that many other States have implemented ACA without the dramatic impacts on SNAP that have occurred in North Carolina,\u201d Bailey wrote.\n\nAre you or someone you know waiting for food stamps?
