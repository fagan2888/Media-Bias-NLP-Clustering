Moda was surprised and disappointed by last week\u2019s initial decision, according to Jonathan Nicholas, spokesman.\n\nOfficials at Moda have contacted CMS for further clarification. \u201cIn the meantime, we\u2019re hard at work working through this and will need the next few days to fully digest the information, to secure answers to the many questions we have, and to determine how all this may impact us moving forward,\u201d Nicholas said.\n\nOther health plans in Oregon weren\u2019t as hard hit. LifeWise, for example, is only getting back $500,000, after expecting $7.5 million, while Health Republic Insurance anticipated $9.2 million and the Oregon Health CO-OP, $1.9 million.\n\nOverall, CMS said insurers throughout the country will receive $362 million in the first year of this three-year program, but were owed $2.9 billon.\n\nModa Leads\n\nModa Health remains the overwhelming leader of the individual health insurance market, selling 98,000 -- 40 percent -- of 241,000 total plans sold both inside and outside of the exchange. Lifewise Health Plan is second with 45,000 plans, while Providence Health Plan is third at 29,000.\n\nRegence BlueCross BlueShield of Oregon, which has chosen to keep its main brand off the exchange, sold 24,000 plans, second only to Moda Health on the off-exchange market.\n\nOther health insurers have found their own niche -- Oregon\u2019s Health CO-OP has the third-most popular bronze plan, while the other health co-operative, Health Republic, has the only platinum plan. Kaiser Permanente sold one of the more popular gold-level plans.\n\nModa Health will be hard-pressed to keep its post at the top of the individual health market, as its rates are going up an average of 25 percent. Similarly, Lifewise rates have skyrocketed 35 percent. Thrifty shoppers may gravitate to plans with cheaper 2016 premiums, including Kaiser, the CO-OP and Providence. Zoom Health Plan, a new entry on the exchange for 2016, will have the fourth-lowest cost health plan.\n\nDiane can be reached at diane@thelundreport.org.", "article_metadata": {"MobileOptimized": "width", "viewport": "width=device-width", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "HandheldFriendly": "true"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccf70\"", "article_summary": "Zoom Health Plan, a new entry on the exchange for 2016, will have the fourth-lowest cost health plan.\nLifewise Health Plan is second with 45,000 plans, while Providence Health Plan is third at 29,000.\nOther health insurers have found their own niche -- Oregon\u2019s Health CO-OP has the third-most popular bronze plan, while the other health co-operative, Health Republic, has the only platinum plan.\nModa Health will be hard-pressed to keep its post at the top of the individual health market, as its rates are going up an average of 25 percent.\nInstead of receiving $82.87 million, Moda is only getting back $10.4 million."}
