Clinton is trying to appeal to those Democrats whose sensibilities lean more toward the class warfare of Sens. Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren while not excessively offending her well-heeled supporters on Wall Street, in Silicon Valley, and kicking up some sand in the Hamptons.\n\nBut she\u2019s accomplishing neither goal. The restless left doesn\u2019t understand why she wouldn\u2019t penalize the success of those earning $200,000; after all, as President Obama put it, at some point you\u2019ve made enough money. Her moneyed supporters will eventually tire of her painting them as the arteries into which government leeches should sink their teeth. And the ordinary American spends even less time thinking about capital gains tax rates than about climate change.\n\nEconomically, her proposal is nonsensical. Bloomberg describes it as \u201cadding complexity.\u201d That\u2019s an understatement, given that Clinton\u2019s plan creates six capital gains tax brackets for those in the top tax bracket.\n\nRaising capital gains tax rates and holding periods reduces the willingness of investors to exit profitable investments and enter other ventures, including funding the sorts of start-up businesses and expansions that are providing an incredible engine of growth in Colorado. It\u2019s called the \u201clock-in effect\u201d and it is one of the most damaging aspects of capital gains taxes, with the extent of the harm being proportional to the tax rate and the holding period, both of which Clinton wants to increase.\n\nAs authors David Butler and Linda Tischler put it in their 2015 book, \u201cDesign to Grow,\u201d \u201cColorado wants to be a startup state, in order to create the kind of innovation ecosystem we associate with Silicon Valley but on a much bigger scale. It seems to be working: In 2013, a study indicated that, in Colorado, a new startup launches every 72 hours.\u201d\n\nClinton\u2019s proposal is a dagger aimed at the heart of our state\u2019s increasing prosperity.\n\nEven The New York Times says that Clinton\u2019s capital gains gambit is \u201cmore show horse than work horse,\u201d that it \u201cslides over some important institutional details about how people invest,\u201d and that it won\u2019t begin to accomplish her stated goals.\n\nStrangest of all, Clinton\u2019s plan demonstrates ignorance of the success of her husband, following his agreeing (under Republican pressure) to cut the capital gains tax rate from 28 percent to 20 percent in the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997. Following the pro-growth Bill Clinton tax cut, the stock market rallied, employment soared, and \u2014 contrary to the worries of tax \u201cjustice\u201d warriors \u2014 tax revenue increased so dramatically that it allowed President Clinton to preside over the first federal budget surplus in a generation.\n\n\u201cProgressive\u201d politicians, including the leftward-moving Hillary Clinton, offer us anything but progress. Their ideas are old, tired, and the source of repeated, persistent, predictable failure. Her recent policy proposals \u2014 particularly her ill-conceived plan to target the capital gains of the \u201crich\u201d \u2014 won\u2019t help her politically but would greatly harm the rest of us economically. A rapidly growing entrepreneurial Colorado is particularly vulnerable.\n\nRoss Kaminsky is host of \u201cThe Ross Kaminsky Show\u201d on Saturday mornings on 850 KOA.\n\nTo send a letter to the editor about this article, submit online or check out our guidelines for how to submit by e-mail or mail.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Kaminsky: Hillary Clinton\u2019s tax plan bad for Colorado", "title": "Kaminsky: Hillary Clinton\u2019s tax plan bad for Colorado", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/07/30/kaminsky-hillary-clintons-tax-plan-bad-for-colorado/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150730__20150802_Z00_OP02C_KAMINSKYp1.jpg", "height": 447}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150730__20150802_Z00_OP02C_KAMINSKYp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-30T16:28:26+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-23T06:35:31+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddf3d\"", "article_summary": "Bloomberg describes it as \u201cadding complexity.\u201d That\u2019s an understatement, given that Clinton\u2019s plan creates six capital gains tax brackets for those in the top tax bracket.\nAnd the ordinary American spends even less time thinking about capital gains tax rates than about climate change.\nFollowing the pro-growth Bill Clinton tax cut, the stock market rallied, employment soared, and \u2014 contrary to the worries of tax \u201cjustice\u201d warriors \u2014 tax revenue increased so dramatically that it allowed President Clinton to preside over the first federal budget surplus in a generation.\nStrangest of all, Clinton\u2019s plan demonstrates ignorance of the success of her husband, following his agreeing (under Republican pressure) to cut the capital gains tax rate from 28 percent to 20 percent in the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997.\nBut perhaps Clinton\u2019s worst old idea (so far) is her proposal for a massive increase in the capital gains tax rate for upper-income earners, supposedly for the purpose of countering \u201cshort-term\u201d thinking by corporations and investors."}
