John Hickenlooper, chair of the National Governors Association, said during the NGA\u2019s third annual \u201cState of the States\u201d address at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C. \u201cWhat was new 65 years ago now has to be rebuilt or repaired. . . Governors know that you can\u2019t build a competitive economy without the foundation provided by modernized infrastructure.\u201d\n\nRelated: Obama Says China\u2019s Infrastructure Puts the U.S. to Shame\n\nHickenlooper, a Democrat, and Gov. Gary Herbert of Utah, a Republican, echoed the concerns of the president, who warned recently that China and other global competitors are outpacing the U.S. in investing in critical infrastructure. \u201cIt makes no sense that we have a first class economy with a second class infrastructure,\u201d Obama told the Business Roundtable about a month ago.\n\nWHY THIS MATTERS\n\n\n\nThe nation\u2019s governors, including a dozen newly elected chief executives, warn of dire consequences for business and the economy unless Congress renews its support for an ambitious new transportation and infrastructure program.\n\nHickenlooper said states are doing the best they can to increase funding in the absence of a renewed commitment by Congress to fully fund the federal Highway Trust Fund and authorize a new long-term transportation and infrastructure spending plan.\n\nIn fiscal 2014, transportation spending overall grew by more than four percent. State funds increased more than 10 percent while federal funds dropped by more than one percent, according to NGA figures.\n\n\u201cIf Congress does not act early this year, federal reimbursements from the Highway Trust Fund for state spending on contracted transportation projects are at risk as soon as this spring,\u201d Herbert said Tuesday. \u201cAdditionally, unless Congress reauthorizes or extends federal surface transportation laws and programs, they too will expire on May 31 of this year.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe uncertainty created by these two pending events will leave jobs and economic growth at risk in all of our states,\u201d he added.\n\nRelated: Obama\u2019s Big Pitch for Infrastructure Falls Short\n\nThe NGA made its plea the same day a new Republican-controlled Congress was taking office. Hickenlooper said Congress starts 2015 with a \u201cclean slate\u201d and urged lawmakers to end partisan gridlock.\n\nHickenlooper, Herbert and others on the NGA\u2019s executive committee will meet later today with Obama. The NGA\u2019s agenda includes trends and innovations in education, health care, prescription drug abuse, energy production and conservation, cyber security and infrastructure.\n\nObama has repeatedly pressed for more federal support for infrastructure projects but largely struck out in the final months of the last Congress. He did not get congressional support for pumping $302 billion of federal funds into highway and mass transit projects.\n\nCongress also put off until next spring deciding what to do in the long term to bolster the highway program. Lawmakers could raise the 18-cents-per gallon federal gas tax for the first time in 20 years or rewrite the federal tax code to find new sources of financing of infrastructure \u2013 or simply keep up a patchwork approach.\n\nRelated: Fix Infrastructure Now, or Apologize for It Forever\n\nThe American Society of Civil Engineers pegs the infrastructure spending gap at $125 billion a year just to maintain and repair highways and bridges. The civil engineers group in a report card gave the nation\u2019s infrastructure a grade of D+, noting a tremendous backlog and a \u201cpressing need for modernization.\u201d\n\nAfter years of massive highway construction, Congress and state governments allowed their capital budgets to wither in the past decade as they struggled with the recession and budget deficits.\n\nThe NGA wants congressional approval of a long-term infrastructure investment program that provides flexibility for states to maintain innovative financing options, such as public-private partnerships, \u201cwhich can serve as critical tools at a time of great uncertainty for the federal surface transportation program.\u201d\n\nPublic-private partnerships in Colorado and other states help to leverage private sector financing and expertise to deliver new public roads, bridges, ports and tunnels at a lower cost and more quickly, according to the NGA.\n\nThe governors also urged Congress to preserve tax breaks that encourage investment in municipal bonds that are essential for financing many infrastructure projects. \u201cBonds have financed every major infrastructure project in this country for the last century,\u201d Herbert noted.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The nation\u2019s governors on Tuesday joined President Obama in urging Congress to boost s", "title": "Governors Join Obama in Infrastructure Spending Plea", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/01/06/Governors-Join-Obama-Infrastructure-Spending-Plea", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/02172011_highway_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/01/06/Governors-Join-Obama-Infrastructure-Spending-Plea", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/02172011_highway_article.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@ericpianin"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "The nation\u2019s governors on Tuesday joined President Obama in urging Congress to boost s", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde607\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIt makes no sense that we have a first class economy with a second class infrastructure,\u201d Obama told the Business Roundtable about a month ago.\nRelated: Fix Infrastructure Now, or Apologize for It ForeverThe American Society of Civil Engineers pegs the infrastructure spending gap at $125 billion a year just to maintain and repair highways and bridges.\nIn fiscal 2014, transportation spending overall grew by more than four percent.\nGovernors know that you can\u2019t build a competitive economy without the foundation provided by modernized infrastructure.\u201dRelated: Obama Says China\u2019s Infrastructure Puts the U.S. to ShameHickenlooper, a Democrat, and Gov.\nThe governors also urged Congress to preserve tax breaks that encourage investment in municipal bonds that are essential for financing many infrastructure projects."}
