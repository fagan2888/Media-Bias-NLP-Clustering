Now, creditors have three days to provide a revised loan estimate once a consumer locks in a floating interest rate. Previously, the loan estimates were due on the day the rate was locked.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAnother change will give creditors more leeway in revising estimates for construction loans. Because construction loans take longer to settle than other loans, the CFPB said estimated charges often change. Under the new rule, there is a space on the loan estimate form where creditors can notify consumers they could receive a revised estimate if the loan does not settle in 60 days.\n\n\u201cThe new \u2018Know Before You Owe\u2019 mortgage forms improve consumer understanding, aid comparison shopping, and help prevent closing table surprises for consumers,\u201d CFPB Director Richard Cordray said in a news release on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s minor changes will make it easier for creditors to comply with the disclosure rules while maintaining these important new consumer protections.\u201d\n\nBut some creditors want the CFPB to provide more guidance on its regulations.\n\nThe National Association of Federal Credit Union (NAFCU) wants the bureau to issue creditors written guidance on how to comply with the Truth in Lending Act and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act.\n\n\u201cWe believe reliable written guidance is essential for credit unions to operate on a level playing field in implementing the regulation, and will help avoid unnecessary confusion and discrepancies in implementation down the road,\u201d NAFCU Director of Regulatory Affairs Alicia Nealon said.\n\nNow the CFPB provides oral guidance on its regulations through its hotline and webinars.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The CFPB is giving creditors more leeway in notifying clients of revised construction loan estimates.", "description": "The CFPB is giving creditors more leeway in notifying clients of revised construction loan estimates.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Lydia Wheeler", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The CFPB is giving creditors more leeway in notifying clients of revised construction loan estimates.", "title": "Changes to 'Know Before You Owe' mortgage rules finalized", "url": "http://thehill.com/regulation/230235-changes-to-know-before-you-owe-mortgage-rules-finalized", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T03:59:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T03:59-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/regulation/230235-changes-to-know-before-you-owe-mortgage-rules-finalized", "dcterms.date": "2015-01-21T11:27-05:00", "dcterms.creator": "Lydia Wheeler", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "CFPB, Truth in Lending Act, Loan, Construction spending,,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-01-21T11:27:53-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T03:59:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/regulation/230235-changes-to-know-before-you-owe-mortgage-rules-finalized", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The CFPB is giving creditors more leeway in notifying clients of revised construction loan estimates.", "card": "summary", "title": "Changes to 'Know Before You Owe' mortgage rules finalized"}, "dcterms.title": "Changes to 'Know Before You Owe' mortgage rules finalized"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc71c\"", "article_summary": "The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has finalized some changes to its \u201cKnow Before You Owe\u201d mortgage rules.\nNow, creditors have three days to provide a revised loan estimate once a consumer locks in a floating interest rate.\nThe National Association of Federal Credit Union (NAFCU) wants the bureau to issue creditors written guidance on how to comply with the Truth in Lending Act and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act.\nBecause construction loans take longer to settle than other loans, the CFPB said estimated charges often change.\n\u201cThe new \u2018Know Before You Owe\u2019 mortgage forms improve consumer understanding, aid comparison shopping, and help prevent closing table surprises for consumers,\u201d CFPB Director Richard Cordray said in a news release on Tuesday."}
