Marilinda Garcia (R) says she\u2019s planning to run for a House seat in order to bring some diversity to a party she views as \u201cpopulated mostly with old, white men.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is a stereotype about the Republican Party at this point,\u201d Garcia told the New Hampshire Union Leader. \u201cIt does concern me, so I feel it\u2019s incumbent on me to be the change you want to see.\u201d\n\nAn adjunct professor of music who holds a master\u2019s in public policy from Harvard, Garcia describes herself as pro-business and says she supports the \u201cfull repeal of Obamacare,\u201d according to the Union Leader.\n\nThe Hispanic conservative leans too far right for some. The New Hampshire Democratic Party's Communication Director, Harrell Kirstein, slammed Garcia as a \"Tea Party ideologue\" Monday, after she announced that she'd run.\n\n\"From imposing new restrictions on women\u2019s health care services to having state government interfere with the rights of businesses and their employees to freely negotiate contracts, Garcia\u2019s priorities are not New Hampshire\u2019s,\"\n\nThe Republican Party has struggled with its image among Hispanics and women in the wake of the 2012 presidential election.\n\nPresident Barack Obama won some 55 percent of the women\u2019s votes, compared to 44 percent for Mitt Romney, according to CNN exit polls -- an advantage that particularly helped the president\u2019s reelection campaign in swing states.\n\nThe vote was even more lopsided for Hispanics. Obama won 71 percent of the Latino vote, with Romney pulling only 27 percent, the worst showing since Bob Dole\u2019s unsuccessful 1996 campaign.\n\nThe GOP has tried to boost its appeal to Latinos, launching a seven-state outreach effort in October.\n\nAlso on HuffPost: Latino Winners And Losers In Congressional Elections Latino Winners And Losers In Congressional Elections\n\n1 of 31 Ted Cruz (R-TX) The Cuban-American conservative who's faced offensive attacks against his Hispanic background became the first Latino from Texas to hold a U.S. Senate seat.
