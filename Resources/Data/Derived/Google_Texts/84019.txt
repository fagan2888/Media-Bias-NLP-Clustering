GRAND JUNCTION, Colo. (AP) — Authorities say they have found three prized pistols stolen last month from a western museum in Grand Junction.

The Grand Junction Sentinel (http://bit.ly/1NFHZj1 ) reports the guns included two Glock handguns carried by former Mesa County sheriffs and a gold-plated Colt Bisley .38 caliber revolver. The revolver was carried by Leo Carillo as he played Pancho in the 1950s television western “The Cisco Kid.”

David Bailey, curator of history at the Museum of the West, says the revolver was a favorite because of its elephant-ivory grips.

The guns were stolen from a shattered glass case on Nov. 2. Police are investigating a series of burglaries that took place around the same time. But authorities say no one has been charged with taking the firearms.
