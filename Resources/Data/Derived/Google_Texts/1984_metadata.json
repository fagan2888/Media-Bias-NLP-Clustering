I cross every part of my body and just pray. Everything is clicking. Those are usually the elements that bring a team what every fan wants.\u201d\n\nFor those who have been following Milano\u2019s Twitter feed, rest easy. Her phone was returned to her after she left it on a plane over the weekend. Flight attendants had it and no info has been leaked, she says.\n\nMilano continues to tweet about baseball, fashion, her toddler son, and the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cAny issue I believe in, I am always very vocal about,\u201d Milano says. \u201cAnd the #getcovered campaign is important because there is so much information that is not there about Obamacare and the Affordable Care Act, and I\u2019m making sure it is accessible to people.\u201d\n\nDespite the tweets, and passing along stories about the government shut down, Milano has zero interest in casting her lot into politics.\n\n\u201cI am so disenchanted by politics,\u201d she says. \u201cI would never even consider it my interest. It is more than I want to leave a better world for my son and I try to be vocal about the things that are important.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "&quot;I cross every part of my body and just pray,&quot; Alyssa Milano says of the Los Angeles Dodgers. &quot;Everything is clicking.
