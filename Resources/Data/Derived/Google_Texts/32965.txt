Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) endorsed Republican presidential candidate Florida Sen. Marco Rubio Monday morning on Fox News’ “Fox and Friends.”

“Marco Rubio really is an exciting candidate, and I’m pleased to be able to endorse him and work for him for the presidency,” Issa said.

Issa told show host Steve Doocy that he and Rubio have been “fighting some of the same fights,” saying the presidential hopeful helped save Americans billions of dollars in the Affordable Care Act.

“He saved us money on Obamacare where others have simply wanted to repeal it,” Issa said. “He’s already saved $2.5 billion by eliminating an unreasonable backstop by taxpayers for a failed program — he’s been fighting for a lot of things I believe in.”

Issa said Rubio is not afraid to “engage on the hottest subjects,” adding that he believes that will be important because the incoming president will have to remedy “a lot of broken things, including our foreign policy.”
