Within days, Ukrainian troops lost the city of Debaltseve to a new Russian-backed rebel offensive. At the same time, European negotiations on the Greek financial crisis broke down in acrimony. This is the hour of Europe, and it\u2019s a disaster.\n\nAnd really, it\u2019s the hour of Germany, the West\u2019s crucial player. Led uncertainly by Germany, the European Union\u2019s response to Russia\u2019s aggression was to impose trade sanctions.\n\nBy the same token, what\u2019s prolonging the Greek crisis is Germany\u2019s contradictory desire to force Greece to be disciplined so Berlin gets its money back, but also to keep Greece in the euro.\n\nThe result of that policy has been to push Greece into a deep depression and put its politics in a headlock. The Greek people broke out by electing Syriza, an idiotic Marxist party which has the sole virtue of believing Greece should be governed from Athens, not Berlin.\n\nGerman policy in Ukraine has been equally useless. The Germans like to whine\u2014actually a form of bragging\u2014about the sacrifices they have made to impose costs on Russia. This is nonsense.\n\nGerman exports to Russia in 2013 were under four percent of Berlin\u2019s total, and over the first eight months of 2014, those exports declined by less than 20 percent.\n\nGermany\u2019s sacrifices in cracking down on Russia\u2014which has invaded a sovereign European nation, annexed a chunk of its territory, and shot down a civilian airplane\u2014has cost Berlin about $8 billion, in an economy worth almost $4 trillion.\n\nNo wonder Putin thinks the Europeans are pushovers. But it\u2019s worse than that. The point of the cease-fire wasn\u2019t to stop the war in Ukraine. It was to stop the nascent U.S. push to arm Ukraine. As Merkel put it recently, \u201cprogress on Ukraine cannot be achieved by more weapons.\u201d\n\nThat is more nonsense. Until Ukraine can defend itself, the Russian-backed separatists have no reason to stop fighting. Building up Ukraine\u2019s defensive power will be a long job, but it needs to start now.\n\nThe German opposition to arming Ukraine gives Russia a veto on Ukraine\u2019s future: Russia can always threaten to restart the war if Ukraine resists its will.\n\nSo Germany, to get its money back, has pushed Greece into an economic collapse so serious that the Greeks believe the answer is Marxism.\n\nAt the same time, Germany moans about imposing sanctions on Russia that have cost it one percent of its exports, and it refuses to respond seriously to the fact that Russia is overthrowing a European nation by force of arms.\n\nAs the German magazine Der Spiegel put it, Merkel has done \u201cexactly what Germans expect from her: Fight for peace, search for compromise with the Russians, and resist the Americans.\u201d\n\nEvery nerve in Germany is straining not to sanction Russia, but to give it a hug and sell it a car. And much of the rest of Europe, frighteningly, has even less backbone than Germany.\n\nGermany is not Europe\u2019s master. But it is Europe\u2019s manager. That management has been disastrous. In Ukraine, people are dying to get into Europe. In Greece, they\u2019re dying to get out of it. In both places, Germany has practiced the worst kind of checkbook diplomacy: draconian and grasping in Greece, narrow-minded and skinflint in Ukraine.\n\nThe first \u201chour of Europe\u201d came during the Balkan Wars of the 1990s, when Bill Clinton\u2019s administration wanted to arm Serbia\u2019s opponents to give them a fighting chance on the ground. The Europeans said no: the result was genocide.\n\nTwenty years later, Europe is fecklessly downplaying catastrophes on its doorstep, narrowly focused on its commercial interests\u2014and concerned above [all] with stopping the Americans.\n\nOriginally published in Newsday.", "article_metadata": {"description": "This is the hour of Europe, and it's a disaster.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "This is the hour of Europe, and it's a disaster.", "title": "Germany Falters in Ukraine and Greece", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/zumaamericastwelve112637.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-02-27T18:07:36+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1DLcjG1"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "This is the hour of Europe, and it's a disaster.", "title": "Germany Falters in Ukraine and Greece", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/zumaamericastwelve112637.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "International", "tag": "europe,International", "published_time": "2015-02-28T03:01:25+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-27T18:07:36+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Germany, Ukraine, Greece, Putin, cease-fire, financial crisis, Europe, Russia, hour of Europe, Angela Merkel"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc0be\"", "article_summary": "In both places, Germany has practiced the worst kind of checkbook diplomacy: draconian and grasping in Greece, narrow-minded and skinflint in Ukraine.\nThe German opposition to arming Ukraine gives Russia a veto on Ukraine\u2019s future: Russia can always threaten to restart the war if Ukraine resists its will.\nLed uncertainly by Germany, the European Union\u2019s response to Russia\u2019s aggression was to impose trade sanctions.\nSo Germany, to get its money back, has pushed Greece into an economic collapse so serious that the Greeks believe the answer is Marxism.\nAnd really, it\u2019s the hour of Germany, the West\u2019s crucial player."}
