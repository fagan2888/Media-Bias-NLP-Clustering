Former Republican Presidential candidate and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney breezed through Boise March 20, but not before endorsing Idaho's Congressman Mike Simpson, Sen. Jim Risch and Gov. C.L. "Butch" Otter at a fundraiser for Otter and Simpson.



"This is a governor who has been standing up for the people of Idaho in a way I think people can recognize," Romney told the press about Otter, citing Idaho's unemployment rate (5.4 percent), which is lower than the national average of 6.4 percent, as evidence of his leadership.



"Our economy is in great shape," Otter said.



He went on to laud Idaho's Congressional delegation for its opposition to President Barack Obama and the Affordable Care Act, the health care reform package widely seen as the president's signature achievement in his time in office. Risch said the ACA, also known as Obamacare, has been a disappointment.



"There's a bit of buyer's remorse," he told the press.

During a brief question-and-answer period, Romney told reporters that the Republican Party is making changes that will make it more competitive on the national political scene."What the party can do is limit the number of debates. Also the party has moved the [presidential nomination] convention forward," he said.But as for individual members of congressional delegations, "It's up to the candidates and their message," Romney said.
