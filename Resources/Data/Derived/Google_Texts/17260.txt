The conservative opinionati lit up Thursday when it looked as if President Obama's administration committed yet another Affordable Care Act blunder.

This time it was all about grammar, specifically a Tweet from @WhiteHouse that contained a picture of a name tag that said: "#GetCovered Because it'll give your mom piece of mind."

Said Twitchy: ‘No wonder the website sucks’: WH’s cringeworthy O-care typo does Common Core proud.

Town Hall led with the more anodyne: New White House Push: Sign Up For Obamacare Because It Will Give Your Mother "Piece of Mind."

Fools.

It's all part of the plan.

It's clearly the soft launch of yet another demographic targeting effort. This one aims at aging headbangers who loved "Piece of Mind," the pièce de résistance fourth album of the heavy metal group Iron Maiden. The story behind the band's mascot, Eddie: He was born with just a head -- a pre-existing condition if ever there were one. It fits perfectly with the core mission of Obamacare.

On the Piece of Mind album, Eddie also had a lobotomy, a condition that sums up the copy editing of whoever pushed this out on @WhiteHouse.
