I'll let Scot put together that forecast over the coming weeks, but one factor he and all of us here in the Storm Center are watching is the El Ni\u00f1o event in the Pacific.\n\nEl Ni\u00f1o can be described as weather phenomena that affects weather patterns world-wide driven by above normal sea surface temperatures near the equator in the Pacific Ocean.\n\nIt's one factor of many we watch for the winter, but certainly one of the most dominate. The latest picture of ocean temperatures shows the well developed El Ni\u00f1o going on right here in the central Pacific. Notice other areas of the Pacific Ocean are also warmer than normal.\n\nWhy is this important? This is the strongest El Ni\u00f1o for late summer since 1997. If this trend continues, it should help deliver warmer than normal temperatures from the northern plains into Canada during the heart of winter and cooler than normal conditions across the southern part of the United States. Keep in mind many details have yet to be worked out of the forecast, but it will prove interesting to watch.\n\nForecast {{Title}} Remove Change News General Courts Web Only Crime Outdoors Events Center Non-Homepage Boredom Busters Pipeline Positively KELOLAND Technology Hunger Affordable Care Act Shops Flooding Remembering 9/11 Drought JazzFest Spring Storm Honor Flight Spencer Anniversary\n\nDoApp Health News Business News Sports\n\nAgriculture Markets Livestock Crops Politics\n\nHealthBeat Cancer Children's Health Heart Health Wellness & Nutrition General Health Beat Women's Health RX Resources What's Going Around OTC Diabetes Recalls Dental Health Men's Health\n\nPolitics South Dakota Legislature Budget Congress Taxes General Local Campaign President US Senate New Laws US House Iowa Ballot Issues Local Races Minnesota Gubernatorial\n\nEducation Funding College Elementary High School Pre K School Supplies Middle School\n\nSports Professional College High School Sports Zone Headlines Summit League Tournament Olympics\n\nBusiness Industry Your Money Matters Development Gas & Energy Legislation Economy/Stocks Employment General Health Care Technology Education Funding Tourism Banking/Finance Housing Transportation Insurance Meetings & Events Retail & Restaurants All Industries On The Move Shops Agriculture\n\nFeatured Stories Eye on KELOLAND Inside KELOLAND\n\nWeather Snow Forecast Records Rain Flooding Drought WX Corner General\n\nWorld News\n\nInvestigates GEAR UP\n\nSponsored Done\n\n\u00a9 2016 KELOLAND TV.
