The media\u2019s holding Carson up as an example of how retrograde his views are, but meanwhile even the right wing of the GOP field is ready for gay marriage coast to coast so long as it\u2019s being enacted by state legislatures.\n\nAllahpundit muses on how the Santorum/Huckabee types in the GOP field will respond to any or all of this, noting that Carson may well end up being seen as too hard on gay issues by people on the left and too soft on gays by social cons. But his position will almost certainly be the position of the GOP presidential candidate, who will definitely not be Dr. Ben. Or Rick Santorum or Mike Huckabee, either.\n\nRead the whole thing.\n\nThis opens up a larger question that the GOP would do well to grapple with head-on: If the vast majority of presidential wannabes are good with gay marriage\u2014or are at least good with the federal government staying the hell out of the issue\u2014what will they do to take it off the table for discussion among their prospective candidates and national figures?\n\nPolls routinely show 55 percent to 60 percent of Americans approve of gay marriage. The quickness with which the issue went from not even being on the radar screen to majority and growing acceptance indicates that no political party is ever going to do well because of an anti-gay marriage position (though a party might still flourish despite an anti-gay marriage stance). Of course, the gay marriage issue resonates perfectly with all the things that conservatives say they favor, such as long-term commitment in adult relationships, devolving power out of Washington, etc. Other than a religiously based opposition to homosexual activity\u2014and most conservatives would agree that there is and should be a separation of church and state\u2014nothing about the issues surrounding gay marriage presents a problem for conservatives.\n\nConservatives and Republicans should also consider how the belief that they are homophobic hurts them with the general population. Regardless of what presidential candidates might think on the issue of gay marriage, the national and many state-level GOP platforms are anti-gay.\n\nThere are large numbers of voters who are neither Republican nor Democratic loyalists. Call them moderates, independents, whatever. Like most voters, these people care first and foremost about issues such as \"the economy,\" \"the availability of good jobs,\" and \"the way the federal government is working,\" to name the top three concerns among registered voters according to Gallup last fall.\n\nWhile these voters may not vote with gay issues in the front of their minds, to the extent that Republicans are seen as intolerant and spiteful if not hateful toward gays, voters will likely go the other way. Or, same thing, not feel comfortable voting for a Republican. Especially if that doesn't reflect the feelings of the party's presidential candidates, the GOP should work to change the way it operates in the court of public opinion.\n\nHere's Ben Carson apologizing on CNN:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "As Matt Welch noted Wednesday, pediatric neurosurgeon and next Republican president of the United States Ben Carson both \"lived down to stereotype\" and", "title": "Q for Ben Carson: Is \"Caving to Gays\" a Choice, Too?
