This week\u2019s tour is traveling throughout southeastern Colorado to Trinidad, La Junta, Lamar and Limon.\n\nWe arrived Tuesday evening in Trinidad, a town of about 9,000 people located about 13 miles north of the New Mexico border. One of the first things that happened: Getting scolded by Trinidad Mayor Joe Reorda for using my phone for research while folks were milling around prior to the Colorado Space Business Roundtable presentation. Of course, at the time, I didn\u2019t know he was the mayor. I just thought he was a guy who doesn\u2019t like phones.\n\nTurns out he likes phones, but doesn\u2019t quite understand technology \u2014 he said he had to have a kindergartner explain how to use his new laptop. He\u2019s also committed to bringing industry to the town. In the short time we spent together over the last two days, he\u2019s mentioned his strong support of both fracking (\u201cI realize that fracking is going to cause pollution \u2014 we\u2019re all that smart. So we have to decide if we\u2019re going to starve to death or get a little pollution.\u201d) and legal marijuana (\u201cIt\u2019s medicine,\u201d he said, citing the examples of successful treatment of seizures with the high-cannabidiol strain Charlotte\u2019s Web).\n\nThose industries aren\u2019t common bedfellows. But the town has taken some hits, the most recent being the layoff of 100 Pioneer Natural Resources oil workers in May.\n\nPeople here work hard to survive: The director of the ambulance service is also the country coroner; an independent news publisher also works with an interactive media company that creates virtual reality experiences. Career multi-tasking is a way of life, a mode of survival, and driven by a sense of commitment: it seems everyone who lives here loves this town, which creates a sense of togetherness and unity.\n\nBut back to the space stuff: One of the stops along the way was at Topar Racing. Topar\u2019s 50-plus employees manufacture parts for dirt bikes and racing motorcycles and anything else anyone needs. The company has grown into a full-scale machine shop that ships products to seven countries. And they\u2019ve worked with aerospace giant Lockheed Martin \u2014 whose Space Systems division is headquartered in the Denver metro area \u2014 on some small contracts.\n\n\u201cYou know how it is in a little town: you have to do a lot of stuff to stay afloat \u2026 pretty much anything you want, we can get,\u201d said Tony Paradisa, owner of Topar Racing.\n\nOne of the purposes of the road trip is to show companies that aerospace work doesn\u2019t have to always take place in Denver and that they, too, can get into the industry\u2019s supply chain. In a place like Trinidad, this could make a big difference.\n\n\u201cThe gas industry in Trinidad probably isn\u2019t going to sustain a whole lot of people right now because it\u2019s like a big roller coaster,\u201d Paradisa said. \u201cTrinidad needs to get something steady \u2026 I think that it would be really good to get something so you can hire more educated, quality people in Trinidad.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/thebalancesheet/2015/08/20/csbr-trip-se-colorado-road-trip-what-is-it/13420/", "site_name": "The Balance Sheet", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/thebalancesheet/files/2015/08/IMG_6395-495x364.jpg", "type": "blog", "title": "CSBR trip SE Colorado road trip: What is it?"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "title": "CSBR trip SE Colorado road trip: What is it?", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/thebalancesheet/2015/08/20/csbr-trip-se-colorado-road-trip-what-is-it/13420/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/thebalancesheet/files/2015/08/IMG_6395-495x364.jpg", "creator": "@LauraKeeney", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "follow, all", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb19e\"", "article_summary": "The Colorado Space Business Roundtable road trip takes place a couple times per year, visiting rural areas of the state to bring together aerospace business leaders, state eco/devo folks and STEM advocates with small businesses owners, college students and entrepreneurs.\nThis week\u2019s tour is traveling throughout southeastern Colorado to Trinidad, La Junta, Lamar and Limon.\nOne of the first things that happened: Getting scolded by Trinidad Mayor Joe Reorda for using my phone for research while folks were milling around prior to the Colorado Space Business Roundtable presentation.\nWe arrived Tuesday evening in Trinidad, a town of about 9,000 people located about 13 miles north of the New Mexico border.\nIn a place like Trinidad, this could make a big difference."}
