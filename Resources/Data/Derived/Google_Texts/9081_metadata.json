Headline after headline documents this failure in depressing detail, from ignoring complainants\u2019 allegations to trying accused students in campus kangaroo courts. In response, state and federal lawmakers have rushed to pass legislative fixes. But despite admirable intentions, these efforts double down on a broken campus system\u2014and threaten student rights to due process and privacy.\n\nTake the federal Campus Accountability and Safety Act (CASA), introduced in July by a bipartisan group of lawmakers including Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand Kirsten GillibrandOvernight Defense: VA chief 'deeply' regrets Disney remark; Senate fight brews over Gitmo Dems discuss dropping Wasserman Schultz Defense bill renews fight over military sexual assault MORE (D-N.Y.), Claire McCaskill Claire McCaskillThe Hill's 12:30 Report Dem senator: Sexual assault case show 'troubling command culture' The Trail 2016: Sanders who? MORE (D-Mo.), and Marco Rubio Marco RubioSenate GOP ties Iran sanctions fight to defense bill Analysis: Pa. senator missed most Budget Committee hearings Susana Martinez fires back at Trump MORE (R-Fla.). CASA includes commonsense measures, like preventing colleges from allowing athletic departments to conduct separate hearings for athletes accused of sexual assault. But CASA tips the scales of justice too far towards the complainant by providing him or her with a \u201cconfidential advisor\u201d to guide the student while leaving the accused student without any such assistance. This imbalance conflicts with guidance from the Department of Education\u2019s Office for Civil Rights (OCR), the federal agency tasked with enforcing Title IX, which has made clear that schools allowing advisors to participate \u201cat any stage of the proceedings \u2026 must do so equally for both parties.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nCASA\u2019s faith in self-interested campus judiciaries stands in stark contrast to recent efforts to address sexual assault in the military. In that context, Gillibrand and McCaskill argued that only impartial civil courts could secure justice.\n\nAnd CASA\u2019s most dangerous component provides OCR with a distorting incentive to wield its enforcement power against colleges and universities. CASA would empower OCR to impose fines equal to 1 percent of an institution\u2019s entire operating budget for each Title IX \u201cviolation or failure\u201d it found\u2014and to keep the money for itself. This could be crippling. Last summer, for example, OCR found the University of Montana had committed 40 Title IX violations\u2014a staggering potential loss of $160 million under CASA. Finding a single violation at Penn State could net OCR more than $45 million; finding 40 at Harvard could net over $1 billion.\n\nAllowing OCR to self-fund by fining institutions for violations will only accelerate the rush to judgment in campus hearings, pushing campus administrators even further towards abandoning due process altogether. Already, college attorneys have admitted that pressure from OCR has prompted unjust outcomes. The National Center for Higher Education Risk Management acknowledged in a recent open letter that in \u201ca lot\u201d of cases, administrators are finding accused students guilty \u201cin spite of the evidence\u2014or the lack thereof\u2014because they think they are supposed to, and that doing so is what OCR wants.\u201d It\u2019s no wonder that more than 20 students have recently filed suit against their institutions, alleging unfair campus hearings.\n\nFederal pressure is also causing schools to overreact in attempts to comply with the latest requirements from lawmakers and OCR. For example, just this past week, a shocking report from Campus Reform revealed that Clemson University forced students to complete an intrusive questionnaire about their sex lives as part of \u201conline Title IX training.\u201d Such training is mandated by the Campus Sexual Violence Act, signed into law as part of the Violence Against Women Act. A White House task force on campus sexual assault recommended conducting \u201ccampus climate\u201d surveys, and CASA would make that recommendation law.\n\nClemson\u2019s survey, which required students to log in with names and student ID numbers, included questions like \u201cHow many times have you had sex (including oral) in the last 3 months?\u201d Students who refused to answer were threatened with discipline under Clemson\u2019s student code for \u201cfailing to comply with an official request.\u201d Clemson suspended the survey just hours after Campus Reform\u2019s report. But the fact that Clemson didn\u2019t think twice before forcing students to reveal such intimate details demonstrates just how quickly student rights can be jettisoned to appease federal agencies.\n\nStudents can expect more such intrusions soon. Yesterday, in California, Gov. Jerry Brown (D) signed into law a bill that will require students to obtain \u201caffirmative, conscious, and voluntary agreement\u2026ongoing throughout a sexual activity.\u201d As critics from the Los Angeles Times, the San Francisco Chronicle, and the Orange County Register have pointed out, this so-called \u201caffirmative consent\u201d bill ushers government into the dorm room and shifts the burden of proof to the accused, who must now prove she or he obtained continuous and ongoing consent for each sexual activity. In The New Republic, Batya Ungar-Sargon astutely noted that the bill \u201cproposes to declare a large swatch of normal activity criminal (drinking before sex, reading/sending signs instead of verbalizing request/consent).\u201d Litigation will surely result as already confused administrators muddle through a sexual minefield far beyond their competence.\n\nSo what\u2019s the way forward on campus sexual assault? Policymakers need to recognize that college judiciaries simply aren\u2019t equipped to handle allegations of felony misconduct. Colleges can provide counseling, resources, preventative education, and academic accommodations. But they lack the procedures to reach just results and the power required to properly punish those found guilty. Instead of creating an alternative to the criminal justice system, legislators should devote their efforts to fixing law enforcement\u2019s handling of sexual assault.\n\nCohn is legislative and policy director for the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "When it comes to handling campus sexual assault, colleges are flunking out.", "description": "When it comes to handling campus sexual assault, colleges are flunking out.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Congress Blog"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "When it comes to handling campus sexual assault, colleges are flunking out.", "title": "Legislative rush on campus sexual assault threatens student rights", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/education/219026-legislative-rush-on-campus-sexual-assault-threatens-student", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-02T05:09:48-05:00", "type": "article"}, "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-02T05:09-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/education/219026-legislative-rush-on-campus-sexual-assault-threatens-student", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "dcterms.date": "2014-09-29T15:00-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Joe Picard", "author": "Joe Cohn", "dcterms.type": "Text", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-29T15:00:03-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-02T05:09:48-05:00"}, "keywords": ",Kirsten Gillibrand, Claire McCaskill, Marco Rubio,", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/education/219026-legislative-rush-on-campus-sexual-assault-threatens-student", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "When it comes to handling campus sexual assault, colleges are flunking out.", "card": "summary", "title": "Legislative rush on campus sexual assault threatens student rights"}, "dcterms.title": "Legislative rush on campus sexual assault threatens student rights"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde95a\"", "article_summary": "A White House task force on campus sexual assault recommended conducting \u201ccampus climate\u201d surveys, and CASA would make that recommendation law.\nWhen it comes to handling campus sexual assault, colleges are flunking out.\nSo what\u2019s the way forward on campus sexual assault?\nInstead of creating an alternative to the criminal justice system, legislators should devote their efforts to fixing law enforcement\u2019s handling of sexual assault.\nHeadline after headline documents this failure in depressing detail, from ignoring complainants\u2019 allegations to trying accused students in campus kangaroo courts."}
