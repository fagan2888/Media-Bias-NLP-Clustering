The bones act just like real bones would, and the fractures have the exactly right geometry of a real fracture.\"\n\nIn addition to the models, the kits come with bio-mechanical testing stations, lesson plans, and video tutorials to show the students how everything works.\n\nAmy Trauth-Nare, associate director for science education at UD's Professional Development Center for Educators, helped the team make sure the lessons would be practically useful for teachers.\n\n\"When I started working with this team I said, look, this work is important, but teachers have very little time and very little money,\" Trauth-Nare said. \"They have to be affordable and approachable to teachers. I think we've had that in mind from the start and the team has done a really great job making this something that teachers will be able to make use of.\"\n\nOne exercise included in the kits use real patient x-rays and task students with diagnosing scoliosis. (Photo: Courtesy of Evan Krape, University of Delaware)\n\nTrauth-Nare said the experiments are a perfect fit for the new Next Generation Science Standards that schools are adopting, because they mix engineering into lessons about biology and physics.\n\nOrganizers say the project is an excellent example of an \"interdisciplinary learning\" mindset that breaks down the traditional silos of departments and majors, something UD and other universities are pushing schools to do more of.\n\nThe OIA started as an interdisciplinary senior design program by a team of undergraduate biomedical engineering seniors. As it gathered steam, it has pulled together engineers to create the models; educators to design the curriculum and materials; graphic designers to create the diagrams; and social psychologists to create evaluations to measure how effective the lessons are.\n\n\"I think it's been easy for us to work as a team on this, because we're all centered around the goal of giving teachers high-quality science lessons,\" Trauth-Nare said. \"It's been a really good motivator.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: http://delonline.us/1FsBOuk", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "A team at the UD has created kits to give kids hands-on experience", "p": {"domain_verify": "815a1068696ac12ba65bd5231740d78d"}, "og": {"site_name": "delawareonline", "description": "A team at the UD has created kits to give kids hands-on experience", "title": "Broken bones, torn tendons teach kids science", "url": "http://www.delawareonline.com/story/news/education/2015/04/04/broken-bones-torn-tendons-teach-kids-science/25285209/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/delawareonline.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A team at the UD has created kits to give kids hands-on experience", "title": "Broken bones, torn tendons teach kids science", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/eb091c90ffb4b7928b0fd10189c83843ff6517be/c=1329-0-4386-3057&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Wilmington/2015/04/04/B9316850835Z.1_20150404031703_000_G56ADKQQN.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@delawareonline", "site": "@delawareonline", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600071892", "fb": {"app_id": 175037755863662}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8770\"", "article_summary": "The bones act just like real bones would, and the fractures have the exactly right geometry of a real fracture.\"\nOne exercise included in the kits use real patient x-rays and task students with diagnosing scoliosis.\n\"The x-rays are real patient x-rays.\n\"I think it's been easy for us to work as a team on this, because we're all centered around the goal of giving teachers high-quality science lessons,\" Trauth-Nare said.\nThat's where the University of Delaware's College of Education and Human Development and College of Engineering come in."}
