The legislation would limit Congress to an up-or-down vote on trade deals.\n\n\u201cWe will fight this tooth and nail, and I believe we are going to win,\u201d said Rep. Louise Slaughter, New York Democrat.\n\nSEE ALSO: Rubio touts foreign policy credentials ahead of possible 2016 bid\n\nRep. Peter DeFazio, Oregon Democrat, said trade-promotion authority \u201cis designed to embed into these so-called free trade agreements a bunch of things that are detrimental to the American public.\u201d\n\nOrganized labor is fighting Mr. Obama\u2019s request, setting up a battle on the president\u2019s left while the White House is launching a lobbying effort to bring more Democratic lawmakers on board with the proposal. Mr. Obama has directed Cabinet members to contact Democratic lawmakers who might be persuaded to support the legislation.\n\nLabor unions believe the 12-nation TPP will lead to the loss of high-paying blue collar jobs in the U.S., pointing to the North American Free Trade Agreement of the 1990s and other trade deals as proof. The Obama administration is also crafting a trade agreement with the 28-nation European Union.\n\nSEE ALSO: Obama may find Republican consensus with proposal on cybersecurity\n\nIn his State of the Union address Tuesday night, Mr. Obama finally issued a high-profile call for Congress to grant him fast-track authority, a step that most Republican lawmakers had been waiting to hear.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the first one to admit that past trade deals haven\u2019t always lived up to the hype, and that\u2019s why we\u2019ve gone after countries that break the rules at our expense,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cBut 95 percent of the world\u2019s customers live outside our borders, and we can\u2019t close ourselves off from those opportunities.\n\nThe president said China is pursuing its own trade agreement that would result in lower standards for workers, environmental rules and other international regulations.\n\n\u201cChina wants to write the rules for the world\u2019s fastest-growing region,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cThat would put our workers and businesses at a disadvantage. Why would we let that happen? We should write those rules. We should level the playing field.\u201d\n\nBut Mrs. Slaughter, referring to Mr. Obama\u2019s comment that trade deals don\u2019t always live up to the hype, called it \u201cthe understatement of the century.\u201d\n\nMost congressional Republicans favor giving Mr. Obama fast-track authority, although a faction of conservatives is opposed to granting the president additional power. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Kentucky Republican, said the president\u2019s call for trade-promotion authority was one of the few \u201cgood signs\u201d in an otherwise partisan State of the Union address.\n\nMr. McConnell said the president \u201cbegan what I hope will be a sustained effort to move his own party forward \u2014 to encourage them to work with us to help create more jobs by breaking down foreign trade barriers and allowing America to sell more of what it makes and grows.\u201d\n\nSen. Orrin Hatch, Utah Republican, and chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said he plans to work quickly on fast-track legislation.\n\nBut in the House, about 150 Democratic lawmakers were already on record last year as opposing the trade legislation.\n\nWhite House press secretary Josh Earnest conceded Wednesday that lawmakers\u2019 reaction to the president\u2019s call for fast-track trade authority indicated \u201cbipartisan support and bipartisan opposition.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s going to be some work to be done on both sides to persuade Democrats and Republicans that this is a good idea,\u201d Mr. Earnest told reporters traveling with the president aboard Air Force One. \u201cThe president believes deeply that this is a good idea.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "House Democrats mobilized Wednesday in opposition to President Obama's call for legislation that would make it easier for him to negotiate free-trade agreements, one of the few areas of potential compromise between the White House and Republican lawmakers.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "House Democrats mobilized Wednesday in opposition to President Obama\u2019s call for legislation that would make it easier for him to negotiate free-trade agreements, one of the few areas of potential compromise between the White House and Republican lawmakers.", "title": "Obama\u2019s call for fast-track trade pact hit by Democrats", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jan/21/obamas-call-for-fast-track-trade-pact-hit-by-democ/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/01/21/obama-idahojpeg-00234.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/01/21/obama-idahojpeg-00234.jpg", "description": "House Democrats mobilized Wednesday in opposition to President Obama's call for legislation that would make it easier for him to negotiate free-trade agreements, one of the few areas of potential comp", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Obama\u2019s call for fast-track trade pact hit by Democrats"}, "Author": "Dave Boyer", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, White House, Louise Mcintosh Slaughter"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd079\"", "article_summary": "Liberal critics of Mr. Obama\u2019s proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership, which would be the largest free-trade pact in history, vowed to defeat the president\u2019s request for \u201cfast-track\u201d authority.\nMr. Obama has directed Cabinet members to contact Democratic lawmakers who might be persuaded to support the legislation.\n\u201cChina wants to write the rules for the world\u2019s fastest-growing region,\u201d Mr. Obama said.\nBut in the House, about 150 Democratic lawmakers were already on record last year as opposing the trade legislation.\nHouse Democrats mobilized Wednesday in opposition to President Obama\u2019s call for legislation that would make it easier for him to negotiate free-trade agreements, one of the few areas of potential compromise between the White House and Republican lawmakers."}
