Does it suggest that Republican orthodoxy has failed the working class?\n\nHow Uber knows your phone battery is dying and more\n\nWhy Congress is looking at labels to curb food waste\n\nSmoke detected on EgyptAir Flight 804: What does that mean?\n\nWhen Donald Trump spoke at a South Carolina rally last weekend, the audience booed a Pacific Rim trade deal supported by much of the Republican-controlled Senate. Then cheers erupted in the basketball stadium where he was speaking when Mr. Trump touted his plan to avoid entitlement cuts, saying, \u201cWe\u2019re going to save Social Security. We\u2019re going to save Medicare.\u201d\n\nThose aren\u2019t the talking points of a traditional Republican presidential candidate. Moments later, Trump also defied traditional conservative orthodoxy by asserting simply that many Americans need help.\n\nYet he\u2019s leading in Republican polls, because his message is connecting with people like Donna Reynaud, a mom who drove from Statesville, N.C., with her 16-year-old daughter for the event. She describes herself as a regular Republican voter, but one who\u2019s now fed up with traditional politicians.\n\nRecommended: What do you know about Donald Trump?\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care about the Republican Party anymore,\u201d says Ms. Reynaud. For now at least, her attitude is as blunt as Trump himself: \u201cWherever the Donald goes, that\u2019s where I go.\u201d\n\nFor many supporters, Reynaud included, the top-of-mind rationale for following Trump is his personal qualities: His flouting of \"political correctness,\" his business acumen, and the notion that his riches allow him to focus on the public interest rather than on fund-raising and pleasing big donors.\n\nBut these voters also see the country facing large and urgent challenges, including economic troubles that traditional politicians \u2013 of both parties \u2013 have failed to address.\n\nTrump may not have fleshed-out policy proposals, but his rhetoric speaks to these issues \u2013 including the ones that affect people\u2019s bank accounts, from rising health care and tuition costs to meager retirement savings.\n\nCore ingredients of Trump\u2019s platform amount to a conservative brand of populism. Mainstream Republicans \u2013 who traditionally take some of their cues from big corporations \u2013 haven\u2019t generated Trump-style voter enthusiasm so far in this election cycle.\n\nAnd some political scientists say his polling success is revealing a gaping hole in Republican politics: that many people in the party\u2019s electoral base \u2013 plus a sizable contingent of independent voters \u2013 feel their economic anxieties aren\u2019t being addressed by traditional Reagan-style platforms of low taxes, less regulation, and downsizing government.\n\n\u201cRepublicans have been able to win elections on two sets of issues,\u201d Reaganomics plus conservative social positions on things like guns and abortion, says Daniel Shea, an expert on American politics at Colby College in Waterville, Maine. Today, \u201cthere\u2019s a group of voters that have said that those two sets of issues are no longer enough.\u201d\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean the Republican Party is under pressure from within to jettison its Reagan-influenced focus on low taxes. The people at Trump\u2019s rally in Rock Hill, S.C., didn\u2019t call for higher taxes on the rich. Nor did they voice affection for the left\u2019s populist candidate, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who has made economic inequality central to his campaign.\n\nThe South Carolina rally made national headlines after a Muslim woman, standing in silent protest, was yelled at and forcibly removed. And Trump\u2019s more outrageous statements regarding Latinos and Muslims \u2013 as well as endorsements from white supremacist groups \u2013 have led some critics to claim that his rise is being fueled by latent racism.\n\nBut Mr. Shea calls it an exaggeration to say xenophobic strains in conservative politics can explain the Trump phenomenon. Rather, he sees a sense of economic dislocation as a vital ingredient in Trump\u2019s success.\n\nThe urgency of financial issues stood out clearly in views expressed by the crowd in this inland part of South Carolina, where jobs in industries like textiles and furniture have been migrating offshore for years.\n\n'Working hands'\n\n\u201cWhat we need as a country is jobs,\u201d says Russ Cash. Having lived and worked for two decades in this region, he\u2019s watched those jobs disappear, and now he\u2019s laboring hard as a welder and fabricator to support his family.\n\n\u201cThem hands are working hands,\u201d he says, looking down at calloused fingers.\n\nA lifetime Republican, Mr. Cash says Trump has energized him politically, like no one he can recall in the post-Reagan era. As with many in the crowd here, part of the appeal for Cash is Trump\u2019s status as a successful business leader who entered the race as an outsider.\n\n\u201cHe will bring [the economy] back to where it needs to be,\u201d Cash predicts.\n\nAmong Cash\u2019s worries are the high cost of health care and whether Social Security will stay solvent.\n\nTrump has promised to replace the Affordable Care Act with something better and more affordable, but so far hasn\u2019t spelled out a detailed plan. (One person in the throng says he came hoping Trump would put some policy-detail \u201cmeat\u201d on his message.)\n\nOn Social Security and Medicare, Trump has drawn mainstream support by pledging not to cut benefits, although here too he hasn\u2019t spelled out a detailed solvency plan.\n\nBy contrast, some Republican candidates have opened the door to ideas like boosting the retirement age, means-testing benefits, or shifting Medicare to an offer of \u201cpremium support,\u201d something Democrats deride as a voucher system.\n\nFor many Trump followers, the logic on safety-net programs is simple: Give help to the truly needy and don\u2019t cut Social Security and Medicare, but at the same time, root out entitlement fraud and expect able-bodied people to work for a living.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been paying it for 38 years,\u201d Cash says of his Social Security taxes. Troubled system or not, he expects to get his fair share when retirement comes.\n\nThis helps explain the potency of Trump\u2019s immigration message. Yes, it\u2019s resonating with many white Americans concerned about fast-changing culture. But it\u2019s also about economic values: People at this rally say they don\u2019t want their tax money being used for people who don\u2019t deserve it \u2013 including people who have entered the country illegally.\n\nSimilarly, Trump\u2019s message on trade policy resonates as one based on standing up for average Americans, and not letting jobs flow overseas because of misguided policies.\n\nFor Tracy Sanders, a South Carolina mom who owns a replacement-window business with her husband, this is the issue that she recalls piquing her interest in Trump.\n\n\u201cThat got me,\u201d she says, referring to Trump\u2019s call for a 35 percent tax on Ford if the company builds a plant in Mexico and then ships the output (car engines) into the US for sale.\n\nWill Trump's brand of populism fade?\n\nSome pundits don\u2019t believe Trump\u2019s success to date represents a permanent shift in thinking for GOP voters. An open question is: If Trump fades, will his brand of populism fade in tandem?\n\n\u201cThis unusual phenomenon comes and it probably goes with Trump himself,\u201d predicts Mark Rozell, a political scientist at George Mason University, in an e-mail. \u201cMuch of the support for Trump is personality-driven. I don't believe it signals changing policy preferences among the conservative base of the GOP.\u201d\n\nStill, pundits have already seen Trump\u2019s staying power in the race last far longer than they initially predicted. Similarly, on the left, Senator Sanders has made far bigger inroads against the more mainstream Democratic candidacy of Hillary Clinton than political pros expected.\n\nAnd even before Trump, the party\u200b has seen rifts open up between its establishment wing and tea party newcomers inveighing against the cronyism of business and political elites.\u200b\u200b\n\nPart of the message appears to be that, after years of wage stagnation amid global competition for jobs, coupled with a deep recession, a large chunk of the electorate is yearning for a leader who might bring big change to a troubled economy.\n\nThe title of Trump\u2019s latest book, \u201cCrippled America,\u201d speaks to this sense of the American Dream being at risk for future generations \u2013 as well as to the desire of many voters for a stronger response to national-security threats including Islamist radicalism.\n\nOther Republican candidates, including Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio, have pitched some of their stump-speech rhetoric and policy proposals at struggling workers and families.\n\nBut where Trump drew 6,500 people to the Rock Hill rally, according to news reports, other candidates have been drawing much smaller crowds.\n\nOn Saturday, Mr. Bush was among several hopefuls who participated in a panel discussion on conservative approaches to address poverty, in nearby Columbia, S.C. Some participants spoke about poverty in their own lives and families, yet much of the poverty discussion had an air of talking about how to solve problems faced by \u201cthem\u201d rather than \u201cus.\u201d\n\nThat reflects a gap between the elite and the base, which the party may need to bridge. Many Republican voters, while not poor, are financially squeezed.\n\nSo, even if Trump falters, he may leave one legacy on the party\u2019s economic-policy terrain: greater openness to policies that address working-class needs.\n\nIt\u2019s a path already pioneered by some in the party. In 2007, prior to a national recession, presidential candidate Mike Huckabee sounded alarms that average people faced a hard economy.\n\n\u201cThe people who handle the bags and make the beds at our hotels and serve the food, many of them are having to work two jobs,\u201d he said in one debate.\n\n'I don't care what party they're in'\n\nTrump\u2019s success may hint at an opportunity for Republicans to go further down this road of working-class appeal.\n\nStill, some strong distinctions separate Trump supporters from voters flocking to Sanders on the left. Many conservatives here in South Carolina voice deep concern about the relentless rise in national debt. And although tax reform may not be the top of their economic wish list, some voice support for Republican approaches on that issue.\n\n\"We have to be more responsible,\" says Jeff Myers, a mechanical engineer. \u201cWe can\u2019t keep rolling up debt.\u201d\n\nHe and others at the rally say Trump\u2019s business background and fighting spirit may allow him to succeed at taming federal budgets, where other Republicans in the White House or Congress have failed.\n\nStill, Mr. Myers says he's not yet firmly committed to Trump. He wants to hear the candidate add some policy detail to his promises and says he's also a fan of Ted Cruz, the other leading Republican contender at present.\n\nThe big thing he\u2019s looking for is someone who can lead change in Washington. \u201cI don\u2019t care what party they\u2019re in,\u201d Myers says. \u201cI\u2019m really tired of the establishment.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.content.id": "4a797c9f7bcdd08682479aadfb4ed093", "sailthru.author": "Mark Trumbull", "description": "The Trump revolt appears to be, in some important respects, a blue collar revolt.
