When BenefitFocus hit NASDAQ on Wednesday, the deal\u2019s price $26.50 a share, well above the $21.50-$24.50 projections. Within 24 hours, shares nearly doubled to $53.55. BenefitFocus anticipated that it would raise up to $110 million at the high point of the range.\n\nShould you invest? Don\u2019t miss our interview with BenefitFocus\u2019 CEO at the bottom.\n\nUnlike FireEye and RocketFuel, software-as-a-service (SaaS) companies that experienced flashy public offerings today, BenefitFocus\u2019 IPO was a relatively quiet affair. It hasn\u2019t garnered much attention from the press since it launched in 2000.\n\nThe good news? It is poised to rake in revenues, as the Affordable Care Act health care law takes effect and large enterprises increasingly shift to cloud-based technologies. The insurance industry spent an estimated $55 billion last year on software services.\n\nAccording to S-1 and SEC filings, BenefitFocus pulled in $68.8 million in 2011, with revenues jumping to $81.7 million in 2012. The company serves businesses (these enterprise contracts are particularly lucrative) and over 20 million consumers, helping them more efficiently shop and manage benefits, including life and dental insurance and health care.\n\nThe bad news? The company is still operating at a loss of almost $15 million. But that is to be expected from software-as-a-service players, and the same is true for both FireEye and RocketFuel. It\u2019s more difficult to make consistent revenues when your customers aren\u2019t \u201clocked in,\u201d which is how Oracle became a multibillion dollar giant.\n\nShortly after the announcement, I caught up with Jenkins to chat about the company\u2019s growth, and plans for the future.\n\nVentureBeat: How did you determine that now is the right time to go public?\n\nShawn Jenkins: We\u2019ve been thinking about it for a while. It\u2019s a company that we started in 2000 to put all our benefits in one place. We have built a really powerful network of insurance providers, and we\u2019re now looking more at enterprise companies. This is such a significantly under-penetrated opportunity.\n\nVentureBeat: What are some of the major challenges up ahead?\n\nJenkins: We operate in a very complex environment, as employer benefits are regulated state-by-state. The challenge on the engineering side is to solve the big implementations of the Affordable Care Act and all these new rules and requirements.\n\nWe have to stay current at a time when employer benefits are changing. But we have invested in product development talent and software engineers to expand our cloud technology to comply with employer mandates.\n\nVentureBeat: Why haven\u2019t we heard much about BenefitFocus?\n\nJenkins: It might be the way we grew up \u2014 we were in full bootstrapping mode.\n\nWe didn\u2019t have the option to take venture financing in our early years. But looking back, it was a good thing. Our management team stayed very disciplined.\n\nVentureBeat: What are the benefits for you in going public?\n\nJenkins: It provides great visibility for the company and our model for customers. In future, we will bring a new way to offer private exchanges to employers\n\n[Editors\u2019 note: Private exchanges, which have only existed for about a year, are run by outside benefits companies like BenefitFocus and typically offer more insurance choices than those offered by employers.]\n\nIt\u2019s good timing, as there is a general awareness now that software-as-a-service and cloud delivery is a legitimate category.\n\nMore information:\n\nBenefitfocus Benefitfocus is the leader in software and services for the healthcare benefits market.
