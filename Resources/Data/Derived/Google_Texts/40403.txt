Following March Acquisition, Genstar Capital Invests in Boyd

The firm recently invested in Mercer Advisors and Tri-Delta Plastics

PE firm Genstar Capital has invested in Boyd Corp., a provider of specialty material and sealing products.

Boyd, headquartered in Modesto, California, sells engineered rubber, plastic, metal, flexible environmental sealing products. The company's offerings aim to help with energy efficiency, durability, safety and performance.

Genstar plans to grow the business organically and through add-on acquisitions.

The San Francisco-based private equity firm invests in industrial technology, health care, financial services and software companies. Genstar, in March, bought a majority stake in wealth manager Mercer Advisors. In December, Genstar-backed Pretium Packaging acquired Tri-Delta Plastics.

UBS Investment Bank was Genstar's financial adviser, while Weil Gotshal & Manges provided legal advice.

There have been several energy-efficiency and sealing deals recently, including Huron-backed Albireo Energy's deal for Sky Technologies, a provider of energy-monitoring systems, and, PPG Industries' (NYSE: PPG) deal for sealants business Le Joint Fran√ßais. PPG won Mergers & Acquisitions M&A Mid-Market Strategic Buyer of the Year Award for 2014.
