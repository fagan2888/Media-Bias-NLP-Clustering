According to an analysis from the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation , a family with the most protection available would owe, on average, just $168 in out-of-pocket expenses for an emergency room visit -- roughly half what that family would owe with a standard silver-level policy. The details can vary, from household to household and from plan to plan. But, overall, the extra financial protection can translate to savings of thousands of dollars a year.\n\nThe health care law puts a maximum on those out-of-pocket expenses -- something that didn\u2019t exist before. But those limits are $6,600 for individuals and $13,200 for families this year -- expenses that could cripple consumers without wages or savings to cover such bills. That\u2019s why the law requires that insurers offer more generous \"silver level\" policies, with no additional costs, to consumers with incomes below two and a half times the poverty line -- which, for a family of three, is about $50,000 a year.\n\nHere\u2019s why: The insurance plans available through the law\u2019s marketplaces, like most private insurance plans, come with deductibles and co-payments. If you pick up a prescription, for example, you probably have to pay some money out of your own pocket before your insurance coverage kicks in. It could be just $5 or $10 -- or much higher, like $50 or $100, for some specialty medications. You might even have to pay the full cost, which could be hundreds of dollars, if you haven\u2019t met your overall deductible for the year. You\u2019ll also have to pay out of pocket when you visit the doctor, go to the emergency room, or get tests and procedures. These, too, can get expensive.\n\nAt stake in this latest case, House v. Burwell, is the special financial assistance that President Barack Obama\u2019s signature health care law provides to some people buying coverage through the Obamacare marketplaces, in order to reduce their out-of-pocket expenses. Few people know the law even provides such assistance, even though it makes a big difference for those who benefit from it.\n\nA ruling for the plaintiffs could have little or no effect. Or it could mean higher prices and deductibles for several million people now buying insurance on their own, and maybe even a less stable market. Ultimately, the answer would depend on reactions -- by insurers, the courts and Congress -- that are simply impossible to predict right now.\n\nSo what happens if this latest legal assault does that -- and more? What if it actually prevails? At the moment, it's really hard to tell.\n\nAnother far-fetched lawsuit against the Affordable Care Act won a victory in the lower courts on Wednesday . And while few members of the legal establishment have taken this lawsuit seriously, few members of the legal establishment took the last one seriously. That case, King v. Burwell, made it all the way to the Supreme Court before failing .\n\nTo compensate insurers for reducing out-of-pocket expenses, insurers get special payments from the federal government. Money flows directly from the Treasury Department to the Blue Cross, Aetna and other private insurers. It's the propriety of those payments that the plaintiffs in the lawsuit, the Republicans who control the House of Representatives , are challenging. Congress never appropriated money for those payments. As a result, House Republicans say, the federal government has no right to spend it. The Obama administration contends the spending is mandatory, much like Social Security checks are. That would render a separate appropriation unnecessary.\n\nThe nature of the case -- specifically, one branch of government suing another -- is its key legal vulnerability. As HuffPost\u2019s Cristian Farias has noted and many legal scholars have pointed out, courts generally refuse to consider such cases on the merits, because branches of the government lack \u201cstanding.\u201d If lawmakers have a beef with the president, the thinking goes, they have plenty of constitutional and political tools at their disposal. They don\u2019t need to sue.\n\nIn Wednesday\u2019s ruling, Rosemary Collyer, a federal district judge in the District of Columbia, nevertheless agreed to let the lawsuit proceed. The government has already indicated it will appeal Collyer's decision on the standing question. The case could wind up at the Supreme Court, where Chief Justice John Roberts has already hinted he is exasperated with health care lawsuits from fellow conservatives trying to undermine the health care law. That is one reason so many legal scholars, even those hostile to the Affordable Care Act, think Collyer\u2019s decision is unlikely to prevail.\n\nIf the scholars are wrong and the lawsuit somehow succeeds, on the merits as well as on standing, then a variety of scenarios are possible -- and it\u2019s tough to figure out which one is most likely.\n\nUnder the terms of the health care law, consumers who qualify for that extra assistance are entitled to it, with or without congressional appropriations. So if your income is below 250 percent of the poverty line and you buy a silver plan through the marketplace, then you get that extra help with out-of-pocket costs -- no matter how the courts rule.\n\nIn addition, the law also entitles the insurers to their money, regardless of congressional action. \u201cWhat that means in non-legalese is that Congress has promised to pay them money -- whether or not there\u2019s an appropriation,\u201d said Nicholas Bagley, a University of Michigan law professor and regular contributor to The Incidental Economist blog. \u201cAnd health plans can sue the government in the Court of Federal Claims to make good on that promise.\u201d\n\nAccording to Bagley,\n\n...the question isn\u2019t whether the government will pay the cost-sharing reductions. It\u2019s when. If the government is right, Treasury can pay health plans on a \u201cperiodic and timely\u201d basis. If the House is right, health plans have to file thousands upon thousands of duplicative lawsuits to get the money.\n\nThat legal process, naturally, could be slow and cumbersome -- enough that insurers might have to take other actions. The most extreme would be to pull out of the insurance marketplaces altogether. Alternatively, they could raise premiums to cover their new losses.\n\nSome would feel the effects more than others; a separate set of subsidies dictate the premiums for consumers in households with incomes of less than four times the poverty line. But there's always the possibility that higher premiums could create more serious instability, by scaring away some of the relatively healthy consumers whose premiums offset the cost for beneficiaries with serious medical problems. Jed Graham, of Investor\u2019s Business Daily, has a piece contemplating such an outcome.\n\nRichard Kogan and Edwin Park, analysts at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, argued that the damage from a ruling could be real -- but limited:\n\nTo be sure, marketplace enrollees with incomes above 400 percent of the poverty line could be hit hard with substantial premium increases, as could people enrolled in individual-market coverage outside the marketplaces. Some likely would drop their coverage; the ranks of the uninsured would rise. In addition, the risk pool in the marketplaces likely would experience some adverse selection (with the risk pool becoming less healthy, on average), and some insurers could withdraw from the marketplaces. Yet even in this very unlikely scenario, the outcome would not be a wholesale collapse of the ACA\u2019s structure, as would likely have occurred if the plaintiffs in King v. Burwell had prevailed and premium subsidies were unavailable in the federal marketplaces.\n\nTimothy Jost -- a law professor at Washington and Lee University and, like Bagley, a close student of the law -- was less sanguine in an assessment he wrote for Health Affairs:\n\nBurdened with this cost without reimbursement through the CSR payments, many insurers would cease to offer marketplace coverage. Those that remained would have to raise rates dramatically to ensure solvency. Although much of the increase would be covered by the premium tax credits for low-income individuals, higher-income enrollees could face unsustainable increases. This could well put the marketplaces into a death spiral, where healthy people would drop coverage leaving only high cost patients behind.\n\nOne last possibility is that Congress could react to a ruling for the plaintiffs by formally appropriating the money that the law already promises and that the federal government is already spending. But cases take a long time to work through the courts and a final ruling, on the merits, is likely at least two years away. By that point, Republicans might control the presidency as well as both chambers of Congress. They might be willing to do nothing, and say the ensuing problems are merely more proof that the law is a \u201cfiasco.\u201d\n\nOf course, more than just out-of-pocket assistance might be at stake. The whole health care law could face full repeal -- and that, without a doubt, would be devastating to millions.", "article_metadata": {"description": "It may not be that bad, but it's definitely not good.", "sailthru.expire_date": "2015-09-11 17:42:12 -0400", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "It may not be that bad, but it's definitely not good.", "title": "Here's The Potential Fallout If This New Obamacare Lawsuit Succeeds", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/obamacare-lawsuit-potential-fallout_us_55f1bd13e4b03784e27859f3", "image": "http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/2000_1000/55f1bd791700009a01569db9.jpeg?cache=bx0r08dtyh", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "It may not be that bad, but it's definitely not good.", "creator": "@citizencohn", "image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/2000_1000/55f1bd791700009a01569db9.jpeg?cache=bx0r08dtyh", "height": 1000}, "title": "Here's The Potential Fallout If This New Obamacare Lawsuit Succeeds", "site": "@HuffPostPol", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-09-10 17:42:12 -0400", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=us_55f1bd13e4b03784e27859f3", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "Obamacare,Affordable Care Act,Supreme Court,out of pocket,deductibles,co-payments,subsidies,premiums,Health Insurance", "article": {"section": "Politics", "tag": "Obamacare,Affordable Care Act,Supreme Court,out of pocket,deductibles,co-payments,subsidies,premiums,Health Insurance", "published_time": "2015-09-10 17:42:12 -0400", "modified_time": "2015-09-10 17:46:52 -0400", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/https://www.facebook.com/CitizenCohn"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "article_summary": "The whole health care law could face full repeal -- and that, without a doubt, would be devastating to millions.\nThe case could wind up at the Supreme Court, where Chief Justice John Roberts has already hinted he is exasperated with health care lawsuits from fellow conservatives trying to undermine the health care law.\nUnder the terms of the health care law, consumers who qualify for that extra assistance are entitled to it, with or without congressional appropriations.\nThe health care law puts a maximum on those out-of-pocket expenses -- something that didn\u2019t exist before.\nIf the government is right, Treasury can pay health plans on a \u201cperiodic and timely\u201d basis."}
