The DOT hopes the regulation will act as a basic template for the federal government as well.\n\nThere are only a handful of states \u2014 Nevada, Florida, and California, to name a few \u2014 that have carved out a system of regulations for autonomous car makers to follow.\n\nDOT Secretary Anthony Foxx told representatives from GM, Ford, Tesla and others Thursday at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit that the nature of self-driven cars is such that the government needs to soft-peddle a little when attempting to regulate them.\n\n\n\nFoxx\u2019s comments add context to a press statement on the DOT website explaining a $4 billion initiative the Obama administration is instituting to kick-start the self-driven car industry. The initiative is meant to help autonomous carmakers create new \u201csafe\u201d innovative technologies.\n\n\u201cWe are on the cusp of a new era in automotive technology with enormous potential to save lives, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and transform mobility for the American people,\u201d the press statement reads.\n\nAdditionally, vehicles that operate on their own, Foxx told the auto representatives and reporters, are much safer and typically more environmentally friendly than driver-operated cars. They are so safe, he continued, the government is willing to encourage self-driving car companies offer up their own suggestions on how best to regulate the technology.\n\n\u201cIn 2016, we are going to do everything we can to promote safe, smart and sustainable vehicles. We are bullish on automated vehicles,\u201d Foxx said at the auto show.\n\nThe soft-peddled approach has caused activists to cry foul, with some suggesting that perhaps it\u2019s not a good idea for the government to get too cozy with the auto industry\u2019s self-driven technology.\n\n\u201cWhile it is important for DOT to be knowledgeable about new technologies, primarily ones as dramatic as self-driving vehicles, DOT should independently develop data and information, not rely mostly on the regulated industry to call the shots,\u201d former National Highway Traffic safety Administration administrator Joan Claybrook told The Associated Press.\n\nDespite the Obama administration suggesting otherwise, there is at least one example of the potential dangers associated with self-driving vehicles \u2013 namely, that they take human accountability out of driving.\n\nElon Musk, the titular head of self-driving electric vehicle company Tesla Motors, warned last November that Tesla might need to explore placing limits and restrictions on its self-driving features because, he said, people are doing \u201csome fairly crazy videos on YouTube\u201d showing themselves getting in near misses while using the Model S autopilot function.\n\nIndeed, here are some videos a couple of Tesla owners posted to YouTube last year showing themselves getting in near wrecks while driving in a Tesla Model S in autopilot mode.\n\nWATCH:", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Obama administration offered to waive regulations against the autonomous auto market, but videos show auto pilots nearly causing wrecks.
