Those occur when attackers fire huge amounts of traffic at a Web site until it collapses under the load.\n\nSuch attacks typically entail hundreds of millions of data requests to a site per second. The federal health care site experienced 4.7 million unique visitors in the first 24 hours. New York State\u2019s site experienced 30 million Web requests, which could have been fueled at least in part by a New York advertising blitz on sites like CNN.com, media coverage, and links from news sharing sites like Reddit.\n\nBy comparison, Connecticut reported just under 80,000 Web site visits by the end of Tuesday.\n\nThe more likely source of the problems, security specialists say, was growing pains. Some questioned whether the government had enough database resources to accommodate the huge spike in first- and second-day Web site traffic from insurance shoppers. Federal officials have yet to respond to questions about the problems.\n\nPlanning for that kind of capacity can be tricky, experts say, because if the government spends vast amounts of resources accommodating first-day traffic, its databases could sit idle a week later. If the government underinvests, computer specialists say, they could encounter the problems that cropped up Monday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a cost-benefit trade-off,\u201d said Matthew Prince, the founder of Cloudflare, a San Francisco start-up that distributes vast amounts of Web traffic across the Internet. \u201cAt the end of the day, you can solve these problems by throwing more money at them. In this case, they could have built an entire data center to accommodate first- and second-day traffic, but at some point, it would have sat empty.\u201d\n\nBoth the federal and New York State health exchanges rely on Akamai, which helps distribute Web traffic across the Internet, and was able to keep the Web sites online even as millions flocked to them.\n\nThe real issue, security experts said, was not that users couldn\u2019t access the site, but that databases could not keep up with the influx of requests. When users tried to register their accounts, they would encounter annoying error messages, such as one many users encountered informing them that the answers to their security questions were not sufficient.\n\nServices like Cloudflare, Akamai and Amazon Web Services help spread traffic from one site to Web servers all over the world, so that an unexpected peak in traffic does not bring down a site. But scaling databases, where a company\u2019s actual data is stored, can be much harder.\n\n\u201cThese are systems that have finite resources,\u201d Mr. Prince said. \u201cIf too many requests go to them, they stop working.\u201d\n\nNew York State officials said on Tuesday that they were doubling capacity to address application processing delays.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20131002173538, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/news/affordable-care-act/2013/10/02/problems-at-health-care-web-site-not-from-online-attack-experts-say/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "description": "Computer experts say technical problems on health exchange Web sites more likely stem from databases overloaded by heavy traffic on the first and second days.", "card": "summary", "title": "Problems at Health Care Web Site Not From Online Attack, Experts Say"}, "DISPLAYDATE": "October 2, 2013", "article": {"published_time": 1380749738, "author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/p/nicole_perlroth/index.html", "section": "U.S.", "modified_time": "2013-10-30T20:59:26-04:00", "tag": "Uncategorized", "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/us/index.jsonp"}, "keywords": "Computer Security,Computers and the Internet,Cyberwarfare,Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010),Akamai Technologies Inc,HealthCare.gov,New York State,Uncategorized", "PT": "Blogs", "author": "Nicole Perlroth", "geo": "New York State", "SCG": "affordable-care-act", "sourceApp": "blogs", "CLMST": "Nicole Perlroth", "byl": "Nicole Perlroth", "BN": "affordable-care-act", "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/affordable-care-act/post", "description": "Computer experts say technical problems on health exchange Web sites more likely stem from databases overloaded by heavy traffic on the first and second days.", "CG": "U.S.", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "October 2, 2013", "org": "Akamai Technologies Inc;HealthCare.gov", "ticker": "Akamai Technologies Inc|AKAM|NASDAQ", "utime": 20131030205926, "PUD": 20131002, "pdate": 20131002, "des": "Computer Security;Computers and the Internet;Cyberwarfare;Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010)", "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "og": {"site_name": "In Practice", "description": "Computer experts say technical problems on health exchange Web sites more likely stem from databases overloaded by heavy traffic on the first and second days.", "title": "Problems at Health Care Web Site Not From Online Attack, Experts Say", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/news/affordable-care-act/2013/10/02/problems-at-health-care-web-site-not-from-online-attack-experts-say/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs_v3/../../packages/images/nytdesign/2013/national/inPractice/inPractice-75.png", "type": "article"}, "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "Problems at Health Care Web Site Not From Online Attack, Experts Say", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "PST": "Blog Post"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf0ea\"", "article_summary": "Some questioned whether the government had enough database resources to accommodate the huge spike in first- and second-day Web site traffic from insurance shoppers.\nBy comparison, Connecticut reported just under 80,000 Web site visits by the end of Tuesday.\nThose occur when attackers fire huge amounts of traffic at a Web site until it collapses under the load.\nThe more likely source of the problems, security specialists say, was growing pains.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a cost-benefit trade-off,\u201d said Matthew Prince, the founder of Cloudflare, a San Francisco start-up that distributes vast amounts of Web traffic across the Internet."}
