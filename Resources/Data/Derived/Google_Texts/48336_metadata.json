Bush issued an executive order in April 2004 to establish the office of the national coordinator for health IT, he had a clear vision in mind: To create a secure, nationwide interoperable network that allows authorized users to access medical records of anyone at anytime and anywhere in the U.S. President Barack Obama knew very well that his plan for providing health insurance to all Americans would not be successful unless it was paired with a plan for controlling the quality and cost of health care services.\n\nIronically, Bush\u2019s health IT network was (and remains to be) the instrumental element that guarantees the financial sustainability of Obamacare. It was no surprise that the economic stimulus package of 2009 allocated $25.9 billion for promoting the adoption and use of electronic health records systems among American physicians and hospitals. But a decade and $30 billion later, only half of the U.S. office-based physicians have adopted a basic electronic health records system and a mere 20 percent of them use such software, according to the latest statistics by Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.\n\nNow that the government funds for promoting adoption and use of such records are dried up, what will happen to the rest of doctors who have not ditched their old-school paper charts yet and still keep their patients\u2019 records in a filing cabinet? In the following, I discuss three drivers which together will lead the other half of physicians to adopt electronic health records systems in the near future.\n\n\n\n[SEE: Political Cartoons on Obamacare]\n\nMarketing efforts by vendors. To increase their profit margins, electronic health record vendors prefer to target customers who will either make a large purchase (large health care organizations with multiple users) or are close by and thus do not require expensive marketing efforts. That is part of the reason why many of the physicians who have adopted such systems are affiliated with larger hospitals or are located in populated urban locations. Now that the low-hanging fruits are all harvested, vendors will focus their marketing efforts on small, office-based practices and will ultimately increase adoption rates.\n\nMergers and acquisitions in the health care sector. With the march toward value-based payment models, new forms of health care organizations will continue to emerge. Some of the individually owned physician offices will become a part of an accountable care organization or will be acquired by a larger health care organization. When these smaller practices join larger ones, they will have to adopt the technologies that are already being used by the larger organization. While electronic health records may not create substantial value for an independent practice, they will be an unavoidable necessity when small practices join larger organizations. Without them, it will be impossible for a large health care organization to coordinate patient care, manage population risks and efficiently submit insurance claims.\n\n\n\n[READ: Health IT That Works for Everyone]", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Policy Dose [Opinion]", "title": "How to Get Physicians to Adopt Electronic Health Records", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Here's why more physicians are going to be adopting electronic health records.", "title": "Going Digital", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/policy-dose/2015/09/24/how-to-get-physicians-to-adopt-electronic-health-records", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/11/f62bc76520e186a73584732a75309e/10223FE_PR_090326health_electronic_records.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Here's why more physicians are going to be adopting electronic health records.", "site": "@USNews", "card": "summary", "title": "How to Get Physicians to Adopt Electronic Health Records"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "opinion", "date_published": "Sept. 24, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Niam Yaraghi,public health,Affordable Care Act,pharmacies,medical records,Policy Dose [Opinion]", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Here's why more physicians are going to be adopting electronic health records."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd327\"", "article_summary": "In the following, I discuss three drivers which together will lead the other half of physicians to adopt electronic health records systems in the near future.\nIt was no surprise that the economic stimulus package of 2009 allocated $25.9 billion for promoting the adoption and use of electronic health records systems among American physicians and hospitals.\nSome of the individually owned physician offices will become a part of an accountable care organization or will be acquired by a larger health care organization.\nWithout them, it will be impossible for a large health care organization to coordinate patient care, manage population risks and efficiently submit insurance claims.\nWhile electronic health records may not create substantial value for an independent practice, they will be an unavoidable necessity when small practices join larger organizations."}
