John Mitchell’s job was to help get Jarome Iginla and Alex Tanguay going.

That was one of the realities Saturday night, when Avalanche coach Patrick Roy reunited Iginla and Tanguay as linemates against the Winnipeg Jets.

Iginla had one goal in the previous 12 games, and his ice time dipped to 9:11 in Thursday’s night overtime loss to Dallas.

Tanguay had three goals this season and only one since October.

“They’re both obviously very good players who have been in this league a long time,” Mitchell, 30, said after the morning skate. “I want to distribute the puck as much as I can. I know Tangs wants to too, so when he has the puck, I just want to get to open ice, open space. I’m fairly confident he’ll be able to find me or Iggy.

“I just want to work hard and hopefully chip in a few goals.”

Going into the late game against the Jets, Mitchell had eight goals and six assists in 43 games this season, missing 11 games in November with an oblique injury.

“I’ve played with Iggy and Tangs before,” Mitchell said. “That’s certainly helpful. I know their tendencies and what they like to do, so it’s just a matter of doing that in the game.”

Since joining the Avalanche in July 2012, Mitchell has been consistent offensively, scoring 10, 11 and 11 goals in the three seasons, so he’s on pace to do slightly better this season. He remains one of the Avalanche’s primary penalties killers and was averaging 15:32 of ice time heading into the game against the Jets.
