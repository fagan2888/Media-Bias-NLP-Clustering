Actor and conservative commentator Ben Stein argued Tuesday that President Obama’s response to the Islamic State terror group shows he has a “real strong hatred for America.”

“Mr. Obama has been wrong from day one about [Islamic State],” Mr. Stein, a former speechwriter for Presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford, said during an interview for Newsmax TV. “He called them a JV team, he said that they weren’t really serious or important. He has not, in any sense, addressed their threat.

“He’s a bad joke,” he added. “As the leader of the most important nation in the world, he’s a bad joke.”

Presented with comments from Rush Limbaugh, who said Tuesday that “Obama is a danger to the safety of this nation,” Mr. Stein replied enthusiastically, “Oh, he’s a very real danger.”

“The question is, why is he so angry at Americans?” he asked. “I don’t think there’s much question that he does not wish America well. He has a real strong hatred of America.”

“We just know that in terms of being a forthright, bold leader who takes on our enemies, he’s not there. He’s missing in action,” he added.
