But thanks to more options on the tube, pad or phone\u2026along with a growing disdain for all-things DC (President, Congress\u2026doesn\u2019t matter), viewers at home are tuning out more and more.\n\nLast year, President Obama\u2019s speech was watched by 33.5 million people despite being on 14 different networks. For context, that\u2019s only half the number of people who watched Bill Clinton\u2019s SOTU in 1993\u2026when the address was only seen on seven networks. For those into pop culture comparisons, Mr. Obama\u2019s 2013 speech was 43 million viewers short of NBC\u2019s Seinfeld finale (which still makes me angry for sucking as badly as it did and ending the greatest series of all-time on such a craptastic note\u2026but that\u2019s a column for another time) and seven million short of the last year\u2019s Oscars (airing on only one network, ABC).\n\nPerhaps the declining interest is because of the repetition of the whole spectacle. You know the drill: President enters (doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s a Democrat or Republican) and has that \u201cWow! I can\u2019t believe you made it!\u201d expression when glad-handing attendees along the way. This is followed by breathless, hyperbolic predictions of the usual pundits off-screen, who will not focus on, you know\u2026the actual state of our union that impacts the daily lives of people at home (economy, health care, foreign policy, jobs, etc.) but instead focuses strictly on the President and what it means to his image: Can he improve his poll numbers? Will this speech turn things around? Can he use this stage to regain the trust he\u2019s lost of some Americans?\n\nThen there\u2019s the speech itself, which can last anywhere from 1 hour and 24 minutes (Bill Clinton, 1995) to 28 minutes, 55 seconds (Nixon in \u201972). Mr. Obama\u2019s average address time is on the high end thus far (going approximately 1 hour and three minutes), while Jimmy Carter preferred to keep matters short (wonder why?), clocking in at an average of 35 minutes, 26 seconds.\n\nPresidential debates (and especially VP debates) make for great TV.\n\nBentsen to Quayle: \u201cYou\u2019re no Jack Kennedy!\u201d\n\nReagan to Carter: \u201cThere you go again\u2026\u201d\n\nThe Gore sighs.\n\nBush 41 checking his watch.\n\nNixon sweating.\n\nBiden cackling after every other word Paul Ryan uttered in 2012.\n\nThe list goes on and on.\n\nBut the State of the Union? You\u2019d be hard-pressed to count on one hand how many notable moments there\u2019s been (from the podium, anyway) since they began being televised back in 1966 (LBJ).\n\nSure, there was Bill Clinton\u2019s declaration that \u201cthe era of big government is over.\u201d In 2009, there was GOP Congressman Joe Wilson shouting \u201cYou Lie!\u201d to Obama in the middle of his pseudo-SOTU (it looked like an official SOTU, but was actually a joint session of Congress). And President Bush outlined his world view in 2002, which included actually naming U.S. ally Iran as part of an \u201caxis of evil\u201d along with North Korea and Iraq (for those just joining us today, MSNBC\u2019s Andrea Mitchell stated Iran was \u201cmore or less an American ally\u201d as late as 2002. Someone better tell Ben Affleck re-edit Argo).\n\nBut mostly, the SOTU is a study of what\u2019s happening with the eyes of the attendees. Nancy Pelosi blinked her way to infamy in 2007 (41 times in 30 seconds, according to a skit on The Colbert Report). John McCain apparently fell asleep (or was resting his eyes) during the same speech (Bush 43). Ruth Bader Ginsberg dozed off during last year\u2019s SOTU (from experience, Red Bull and Reese\u2019s Minis can be extremely effective in avoiding such a scenario).\n\nThe State of the Union address will dominate your free TV channels and cable news networks tonight.\n\nThe analysis before and after will be plentiful.\n\nBut there\u2019s a reason why fewer and fewer people are tuning in.\n\nBecause no event in American politics gets more hype and is bestowed more importance\u2026\n\nOnly to be forgotten in 24 hours.\n\n\u2014 \u2014\n\nFollow Joe Concha on Twitter @ConchaMedia", "article_metadata": {"description": "The State of the Union is one of the highest-rated television programs of the year.
