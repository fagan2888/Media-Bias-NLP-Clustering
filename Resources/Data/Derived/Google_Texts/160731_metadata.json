The documents are sent to both filers and the IRS, allowing the federal government to cross-check what filers say on their returns.\n\n\u201cThe transition relief was intended to give the insurer time to adapt its health coverage and reporting systems to comply with the [Affordable Care Act],\u201d the IG report said. The same was true for employers.\n\nObamacare\u2019s health exchanges did report 2014 insurance details for its customers on a form known as the 1095-A, although more than 800,000 customers on the federal HealthCare.gov portal received ones with errors.\n\nFor non-exchange customers, the 1095-B form from insurers and 1095-C form from employers were delayed for a year.\n\nIRS officials have stated that filers should be truthful on their returns and that misrepresentations will be punished, much as the IRS goes after filers for other shady maneuvers.\n\nHowever, the agency is unable to use enforcement tools such as liens to collect the mandate penalty.\n\n\u201cOur income tax system is built on voluntary compliance,\u201d the IRS said Friday in a statement on the IG report. \u201cThe vast majority of taxpayers comply with their tax responsibilities. As [the IG] noted, the IRS is using the normal post-filing compliance processes this year to verify claims of health care coverage and health care exemptions.\u201d\n\nThe tax season that officially closed April 15 marked the first time filers had to address their health-coverage status on returns.\n\nWhile many just had to check a box, some had to reconcile tax credits they received to purchase health plans on state-based insurance exchanges, or pay the penalty for lacking adequate insurance.\n\nSome people qualified for statutory carve-out \u2014 for instance, people who are incarcerated or cannot afford insurance, even with government subsidies \u2014 or so-called hardship exemptions from the mandate, such as remaining ineligible for Medicaid because a state did not expand its program.\n\nAs of Jan. 2, the federal exchange had exempted 351,971 people, the IG report said.\n\nThe federal exchange and Connecticut, which is the only state that processes its own exemptions, must report exemption data monthly, while filers report an exemption code on their returns.\n\nThe IRS told the IG it will examine the data to see if there is wide variance between exchange data and what filers say.\n\nNon-exempt filers who lacked insurance in 2014 had to pay $95 or 1 percent of household income above the filing threshold.\n\nThe penalty this year rises to $325 or 2 percent of income, and $695 or 2.5 percent in 2016.\n\nTreasury\u2019s IG found the IRS\u2018 tool for calculating what a filer owes is quite accurate, but said it would have been nice if the agency provided such a tool to everyday Americans.\n\nIRS officials said they did not provide one because four out of five people file online, and the IRS had worked with tax software companies to make sure they accurately compute the individual-mandate tax.\n\n\u201cWhile we understand the IRS\u2019s decision to partner with the tax return software provider community, we also believe the IRS has an obligation to provide the same level of assistance to all taxpayers, including those who file paper tax returns,\u201d the IG said.\n\nThe IRS said it will reconsider its position and study whether it can provide a calculation tool on its website.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The IRS cannot be sure that Americans who lacked health insurance last year have complied with Obamacare's \"individual mandate\" penalty this tax season, according to an inspector general report Friday that pointed to a decision to delay proof-of-coverage forms from insurers and employers until 2016.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The IRS cannot be sure that Americans who lacked health insurance last year have complied with Obamacare\u2019s \u201cindividual mandate\u201d penalty this tax season, according to an inspector general report Friday that pointed to a decision to delay proof-of-coverage forms from insurers and employers until 2016.", "title": "IRS unable to make sure people comply with Obamacare penalty: Treasury IG", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/may/8/irs-unable-make-sure-people-comply-obamacare-penal/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/04/15/IRS_Health_Overhaul.JPEG-0af2b.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/04/15/IRS_Health_Overhaul.JPEG-0af2b.jpg", "description": "The IRS cannot be sure that Americans who lacked health insurance last year have complied with Obamacare's \"individual mandate\" penalty this tax season, according to an inspector general report Friday", "card": "summary", "title": "IRS unable to make sure people comply with Obamacare penalty: Treasury"}, "Author": "Tom Howell Jr.", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Social Issues, Labor, Internal Revenue Service"}, "article_summary": "\u201cOur income tax system is built on voluntary compliance,\u201d the IRS said Friday in a statement on the IG report.\n\u201cThe transition relief was intended to give the insurer time to adapt its health coverage and reporting systems to comply with the [Affordable Care Act],\u201d the IG report said.\nAs of Jan. 2, the federal exchange had exempted 351,971 people, the IG report said.\nThe documents are sent to both filers and the IRS, allowing the federal government to cross-check what filers say on their returns.\nThe IRS said it will reconsider its position and study whether it can provide a calculation tool on its website."}
