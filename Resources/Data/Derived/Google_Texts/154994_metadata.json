Shelton said there was potential ambiguity as to whether state law allowed municipalities not to fly the state\u2019s flag.\n\nShelton had expressed an intent to obtain an advisory opinion from the state\u2019s Attorney General\u2019s office as to what the law allows.\n\nWhen asked last week, Shelton and City Attorney Ben Logan said a formal request was never made for an opinion because the Attorney General\u2019s office released an opinion last October that largely settled the question.\n\nThat October opinion was in response to a request submitted by the city of Greenville.\n\nUnder the view expressed in that opinion, the flying of the state flag on municipal property is discretionary and not mandatory.\n\nShelton said this opinion largely settles the statutory question in his mind.\n\nAccording to Logan, he had several additional questions that weren\u2019t addressed by the October opinion. But the city attorney said he would only resume efforts to request an Attorney General\u2019s opinion if asked to do so by city officials.\n\nOne of those additional questions regarded the governor\u2019s prerogative to order the state flag be flown at half-staff as a public memorial.\n\nAs to how renewed conversations might proceed, Shelton did not have any details to provide.\n\n\u201cThe state legislature has apparently decided not to take action on that,\u201d Shelton said. \u201cThere is still some debate as to whether the city will pass some kind of resolution pertaining to the issue.\u201d\n\nLee County NAACP President Rev. Chris Traylor said he wants Confederate symbolism removed from the state flag.\n\n\u201cI do not oppose people having the Confederate flag on their car, in their yard, in their home. That\u2019s their right,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat I oppose is having the Confederate flag in the state flag. The state flag should represent all races.\u201d\n\nAs long as Confederate symbolism remains a part of the state flag, Traylor said he would prefer to not see it fly on city property in Tupelo, noting the current flag\u2019s potential to alienate black residents, particularly older residents who remember the era of Jim Crow and segregation.\n\n\u201cI feel that the flag should not stand on any city property if it\u2019s going to cause confusion, if it\u2019s going to bring bad old memories, bring back pain,\u201d Traylor said.\n\nHowever, he said any decision about removing the state flag should be made through a process of dialogue and conversation.\n\n\u201cIn order to take that flag down in our area and city, we need to come together, the people that are for the flag and the people that are against the flag,\u201d said Traylor. \u201cWe need to come to the table. We are an All-America City and I am glad to be a citizen of the All-America City, so I want us to come together in peace.\u201d\n\nFollowing the slaying of nine black churchgoers by a gunman in Charleston, South Carolina last June, controversy reignited over the symbolism and meaning of the Confederate battle flag.\n\nMississippi remains the only state to retain the battle emblem on its official state flag.\n\nA number of Mississippi municipalities have opted not to fly the state flag in protest of the battle flag\u2019s presence.\n\nThose cities include Columbus, Oxford, Clarksdale, Grenada, Magnolia, Greenville and Hattiesburg.\n\nThe University of Mississippi and the University of Southern Mississippi have also removed the state flag on school grounds.\n\ncaleb.bedillion@journalinc.com", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal", "description": "By Caleb Bedillion Daily Journal TUPELO \u2013 Following the failure last week of legislative attempts to remove a Confederate emblem from Mississippi\u2019s state flag, city Mayor Jason Shelton acknowledged that local leaders may have to again confront controversy over that unaltered flag. \u201cIt will likely come back up,\u201d said Shelton, citing conversations he\u2019s had with \u2026", "title": "Tupelo leaders may again face Mississippi flag controversy - Daily Journal", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://djournal.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/42/files/2015/02/Shelton-Jason-new-mug-102x130.jpg", "url": "http://djournal.com/news/tupelo-leaders-may-again-face-mississippi-flag-controversy/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "By Caleb Bedillion Daily Journal TUPELO \u2013 Following the failure last week of legislative attempts to remove a Confederate emblem from Mississippi\u2019s state flag, city Mayor Jason Shelton acknowledged that local leaders may have to again confront controversy over that unaltered flag. \u201cIt will likely come back up,\u201d said Shelton, citing conversations he\u2019s had with [\u2026]", "creator": "@djournalnow", "image": "http://i0.wp.com/djournal.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/42/files/2016/02/Shelton-Jason-new-mug-102x130.jpg?fit=102%2C130", "title": "Tupelo leaders may again face Mississippi flag controversy - Daily Journal", "site": "@djournalnow", "card": "summary"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=486426430, affiliate-data=1l3vpBD, app-argument=http://djournal.com/news/tupelo-leaders-may-again-face-mississippi-flag-controversy/", "fb": {"admins": 26506061, "app_id": 441890629197277}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/djournalnow", "section": "Local Government", "published_time": "2016-02-28T07:11:16-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=1075"}, "article_summary": "The University of Mississippi and the University of Southern Mississippi have also removed the state flag on school grounds.\nA number of Mississippi municipalities have opted not to fly the state flag in protest of the battle flag\u2019s presence.\n\u201cWhat I oppose is having the Confederate flag in the state flag.\nMississippi remains the only state to retain the battle emblem on its official state flag.\nHowever, he said any decision about removing the state flag should be made through a process of dialogue and conversation."}
