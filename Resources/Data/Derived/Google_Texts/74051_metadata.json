The ear was created using a 3D-printer and was grown in Boston\u2019s Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital. The ear is currently being kept alive inside of a case full of nourishing fluids, according to the Associated Press, and could \u201ctheoretically last for years.\u201d\n\nVincent van Gogh\u2019s descendant, Lieuwe van Gogh, was apparently readily interested in the project, Strebe told the Associated Press. Lieuwe has 1/16 of the same DNA as Vincent, including the Y chromosome passed down through the male line.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The ear is on display in a German museum, and was presented in conjunction with a lecture by Noam Chomsky", "author": "Sarah Gray", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The ear is on display in a German museum, and was presented in conjunction with a lecture by Noam Chomsky", "title": "Artist uses DNA to recreate live replica of van Gogh\u2019s ear", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/06/04/artist_uses_dna_to_recreate_live_replica_of_van_goghs_ear/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/germany-van-goghs-ear.jpeg.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The ear is on display in a German museum, and was presented in conjunction with a lecture by Noam Chomsky", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/germany-van-goghs-ear.jpeg.jpg", "title": "Artist uses DNA to recreate live replica of van Gogh\u2019s ear", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Artist uses DNA to recreate live replica of van Gogh\u2019s ear", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 3d Printing, Art, DNA, painter, Science, Vincent Van Gogh", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdde2b\"", "article_summary": "Topics: 3d Printing, Art, DNA, painter, Science, Vincent Van Gogh, Innovation News, Entertainment NewsMany know Vincent van Gogh as a brilliant impressionist painter, whose many works are displayed in museums across the world.\nArtist Diemut Strebe used cells from the great-great grandson of van Gogh\u2019s brother, Theo, and other DNA to construct a living replica of the ear.\nVan Gogh has also come to embody the quintessential tortured creative genius \u2014 and for infamously cutting off his left ear in a fit of madness in 1888.\nA different museum exhibition showcases the anguished creativity of van Gogh in a far more unusual way: Currently a recreation of van Gogh\u2019s left ear is on display at The Center for Art and Media in Karlsruhe, Germany.\nLieuwe has 1/16 of the same DNA as Vincent, including the Y chromosome passed down through the male line."}
