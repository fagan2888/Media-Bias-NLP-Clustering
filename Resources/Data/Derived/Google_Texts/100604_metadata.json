It masks itself as a workaround to a lack of successful anti-trust suits propelled by the EU and FTC in recent years. (See the full amendment in French here)\n\nThe proposed law is an amendment to the ever-growing \u201cLoi Macron,\u201d which I\u2019ve taken to comparing to France\u2019s ObamaCare \u2013 like ObamaCare, other politicians are jumping on Macron\u2019s desire to get this pushed through by adding amendments with their own agendas.\n\nWho is behind the Open Internet Project?\n\nThe amendment has been put forth and highly supported through pr and communication efforts by the Open Internet Project (http://www.openinternetproject.net/)\n\nUnderneath their good intentions, many of the founding members of the OIP are companies who have already been very outspoken against Google \u2013 in fact, if it was possible to have a hate-group dedicated to a single company, the OPI would be it. You need only look at their twitter feed to see that the OIP has an obsession with Google.\n\n\n\nComment Google organise-t-il son monopole sur\u2026 par openinternetproject\n\nGoogle has already publicly responded to many of the allegations made against it by OIP (see the above video) as well as http://googlepolicyeurope.blogspot.fr/2015/04/the-search-for-harm.html\n\nThe OIP largely represented the Franco-German anti-Google initiative \u2013 or, as they call it, \u201crestoring Internet neutrality.\u201d The OIP is largely made up of players who are either direct competitors to Google (Qwant, invested in by Axel Springer, or Evermaps), and/or companies who have been negatively effected by Google\u2019s updates to its search algorithms.\n\nThe proposed amendment would essentially force Google to prominently display links (read: advertisements) for, let\u2019s say, Bing, DuckDuckGo, and Qwant, in order to be compliant with the proposed bill. The justification behind such a proposition is that Search occupies a dominant role in how people access the Internet that it must be regulated, and Internet users must be aware of their choices.\n\n\u201c We have owned the internet. Our companies have created it, expanded it, perfected it in ways that they can\u2019t compete. And oftentimes what is portrayed as high-minded positions on issues sometimes is just designed to carve out some of their commercial interests \u201d \u2013 Barack Obama, ReCode.net Interview\n\nBarack Obama may have had a point in his interview with ReCode earlier this year when he stated that, often, what is masked as an effort to keep the Internet neutral, is, in actuality, just an attempt at the impacted to affect the impactor.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In this week's episode of \"How France tries to hurt Google,\" the French government has come up with a great plan around making sure that search engine user", "og": {"site_name": "Rude Baguette", "description": "In this week's episode of \"How France tries to hurt Google,\" the French government has come up with a great plan around making sure that search engine user", "title": "The latest French plot to kill Google is hiding in plain sight", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://www.rudebaguette.com/assets/lal303135.jpg", "url": "http://www.rudebaguette.com/2015/06/08/latest-french-plot-kill-google-hiding-plain-sight/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Rude Baguette", "description": "In this week's episode of", "title": "The latest French plot to kill Google is hiding in plain sight", "url": "http://www.rudebaguette.com/2015/06/08/latest-french-plot-kill-google-hiding-plain-sight/", "image": {"src": "http://www.rudebaguette.com/assets/lal303135.jpg", "identifier": "http://i0.wp.com/www.rudebaguette.com/assets/lal303135.jpg?fit=733%2C600"}, "creator": "@LiamBoogar", "site": "@RudeBaguette", "card": "summary"}, "short_title": "The latest French plot to kill Google is hiding in plain sight", "fb": {"admins": 3326514}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/RudeBaguette", "section": "French-Startup", "published_time": "2015-06-08T09:55:18+00:00", "author": "http://facebook.com/liamboogar"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd17c7\"", "article_summary": "Who is behind the Open Internet Project?\nThe bill, which singularly targets Google (due to its dominant search market share in France), is the latest attempt to \u201ctailler\u201d Mountain View\u2019s most precious gem.\nThe proposed amendment would essentially force Google to prominently display links (read: advertisements) for, let\u2019s say, Bing, DuckDuckGo, and Qwant, in order to be compliant with the proposed bill.\nYou need only look at their twitter feed to see that the OIP has an obsession with Google.\nThe justification behind such a proposition is that Search occupies a dominant role in how people access the Internet that it must be regulated, and Internet users must be aware of their choices."}
