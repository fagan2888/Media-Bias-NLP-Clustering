He\u2019s also established the kind of accessible rapport with the faculty and students that has eased the way for his energetic agenda.\n\nWith law schools losing enrollment as a result of the sudden shrinkage in the job market due to technology and a radically shifting economy, Dean Allard \u2014 once one of the most respected lobbyists in Washington \u2014 has used his legendary persuasive powers to shape new attitudes and shed timeworn, trite traditions.\n\nHe\u2019s been a visible and versatile communicator on behalf of BLS and the law profession \u2014 a bright beacon of hope on a darkening horizon. Yet, as fate would have it, he\u2019s about to get his comeuppance on Nov. 13 at a public skewering, hosted by the Student Bar Association. He\u2019ll be roasted \u2014 and, ultimately, toasted \u2014 that night by some pretty potent, would-be Torquemadas.\n\nIt\u2019s a mobile feast of sorts, getting underway at 6 p.m. at Geraldo\u2019s Caf\u00e9, then heading to the Forchelli Conference Center at 7 p.m. Both venues are located at Brooklyn Law School\u2019s Feil Hall at 205 State St.\n\nAmong the roasters will be the ever-popular former Borough President Marty Markowitz, Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce President Carlo Scissura and some new \u201ctalents,\u201d billed in the invitation as \u201cDeanette\u201d Marla Allard and \u201cWiseguy\u201d Nate Allard.\n\nAllard was observed at lunch last Thursday at Caffe Buon Gusto, confirming that the aforementioned Allards were indeed his wife, who hosts the Washington, D.C television show \u201cRelatively Speaking,\u201d and a son reputed to be a \u201cnatural born comic.\u201d Serving as emcee will be the Brooklyn Daily Eagle\u2019s own Charisma L. Troiano.\n\nThe roastee will face fire from some pretty big guns, among them Stephen Trachtenberg, president emeritus of George Washington University; and one-time NBA star and Olympian Tom McMillen, who served in Congress back in the early 1990s, when it was actually \u201cworking.\u201d\n\nAlso having their naysay will be visiting Professor Andrew Napolitano, a Fox commentator; Mark Rotenberg, vice president and general counsel to Johns Hopkins University; as well as current and former Student Bar Association Presidents Elizabeth Geddes (\u201915) and Colin Hedrick (\u201913).\n\n* * *\n\nDean Sure to Face Charges for Obamacare, Other Ills\n\nThe roasters will have a wealth of material to work with, especially if they focus on Allard\u2019s Washington, D.C. background, where he served as partner in Patton Boggs \u2014 perhaps the top lobbying firm in the nation. He was not just a partner; he co-chaired the firm\u2019s public policy department, as well as its government advocacy practice group. All of which means he will have plenty to answer for on Nov. 13.\n\nSome observers suggest that he is probably one of the best advocates in the valued cause of convincing the National Democratic Committee to hold the 2016 Convention right here in Barclays Center. On the positive side, it goes without saying that many of our most eminent lobbyists actually urge legislators to support worthwhile agendas on behalf of the needy and the under-represented. There are certainly some excellent organizations and causes on behalf of which the peripatetic educator has labored in the wilting Washington vineyards. But, why should the SBA roasters bother with accentuating the positive?\n\nAfter all, when you have very knowledgeable and authoritative sources like Rotenberg and Trachtenberg to lend special insights on Dean Allard\u2019s deeds in a gossip factory such as our nation\u2019s capital, those in attendance are sure to learn things about the tormented guest of honor that might shock the faint of heart.\n\nWe should probably expect \u201cDeanette\u201d and \u201cWiseguy\u201d Allard to betray family secrets at the BLS dean\u2019s expense. And, when it comes to roasting, our beloved Marty Markowitz \u2014 who\u2019s been sliced and diced in scores of roasts \u2014 will seek long-overdue redemption.\n\n* * *\n\nMay Link Many \u2018Disasters\u2019 to Dean\u2019s Washington Agenda\n\nOne veteran Brooklyn Law School grad suggests that the high-powered former Patton Boggs partner may be unfairly and inaccurately blamed for, at least, the following: encouraging the invasion of Iraq; overheating the real estate market to create the Great Recession of 2007; and, of course, fouling up national health care with the terribly troubled rollout of Obamacare.\n\nIn addition, he reminds us, there may be good reason for connecting Dean Allard and his cohorts to global warming, ominous flaming sun spots, the southward movement of endangered polar bears and the endless traffic sprawls on all of the approaches to the Brooklyn Bridge. (In truth, Allard undoubtedly had nothing to do with the aforementioned, but since when has truth played any significant role at such a roast?)\n\nGiven that he only assumed his lead role at Brooklyn Law School in summer 2012, some might think it a bit premature to be publically taking a hot poker to this well-meaning lobbyist-turned-educator so early in his term. Au contraire, this writer would say. He\u2019s earned it. He\u2019s been visible \u2014 practically fearless \u2014 innovative and determined to guide Brooklyn Law School to what he believes to be its rightful high place in the legal firmament.\n\nIn making the case for the pre-eminence of Brooklyn Law School, he has also given a boost and a sense of direction to the deserved rise of this too-often-maligned borough, far beyond the boundaries of this city and state.\n\nIt\u2019s fitting that former B.P. Markowitz will be a roaster that night. His enthusiastic leadership ushered Brooklyn upward to a new level of respect. In a certain way \u2014 casting no aspersions on the fine work of new B.P. Eric Adams \u2014 Dean Allard, with his unique skills and background, is poised to do even more for our borough and our beloved BLS.\n\nOne question for the Dean: considering the ferocious onslaught he\u2019ll endure for the benefit of the BLS Student Bar Association the evening of Nov. 13, isn\u2019t he concerned \u2014 perhaps a little apprehensive \u2014 about what might be said?\n\n\u201cNot at all!\u201d he calmly replied across a table at Buon Gusto. \u201cNot in the slightest. After all, I\u2019ll have the right of rebuttal (after the skewers are done) and then I will deliver ... I will have the last say.\u201d\n\nPostscript: This writer, a proud Brooklyn Law School graduate, regrets that he cannot be in attendance Nov. 13, due to a long-scheduled trip to Eastern Europe, when the roast of Dean Allard gets underway. Its actual title is somewhat more gruesome than the one used in this column. It\u2019s actually titled \u201cRoasted Alive in Brooklyn: Dean Allard \u2013 Well Done and Carved Up.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s sure to be a remarkable and enjoyable evening, in itself indicative of a new era for the school. But tickets will be available to the general public. Lawyers here, especially other alumni, would be doing the right and fun thing that night by attending. Call 718-625-2200, or go to the Brooklyn Law School web site.\n\n* * *\n\nColumbian Lawyers to Probe Ways to Deal with \u201cSerious Injury\u201d Issue\n\nWhen the Columbian Lawyers Association of Brooklyn holds its next CLE-accredited session, its members will receive some expert advice in trying automobile negligence cases.\n\nThe program, titled \u201cProving That an Injury Is Not a Serious Injury,\u201d will feature a thorough presentation by representatives of Baker, McEvoy, Morrissey & Moskovits, P.C.\n\nThough the title seems to indicate that the lecturers will be leaning toward the defendant\u2019s side, such may not be the case. In fact, last Thursday, two leading Columbian lawyers \u2014 Ross D\u2019Apice and Greg Cercione \u2014 were overheard at 360 Adams St., wondering aloud whether the Baker firm\u2019s agenda would be directed more toward those defending \u201cserious injury\u201d cases. They will find out Nov. 5, when the Columbians gather for a delicious dinner at the Rex Manor, followed by the much-anticipated program.\n\nLeading the Columbians this year is President Bartholomew Russo, aided by a talented team composed of First Vice President Rose Ann C. Branda, Second Vice President Dean Delianites, Third Vice President Linda Locascio, Treasurer Mark Longo, Corresponding Secretary Joseph Rosato and Recording Secretary Hon. Frank R. Seddio. Historian is George Siracuse and Msgr. David Cassato serves as chaplain.\n\nServing as executive secretary is Lucinda DiSalvo, court attorney to Justice Ellen Spodek.", "article_metadata": {"description": "No good deed goes unskewered at upcoming Brooklyn Law School Roast", "rights": "Copyright 2014 | Everything Brooklyn Media", "og": {"image": "http://www.brooklyneagle.com/sites/default/files/pages/nick-allard-roast.jpg"}, "twitter": {"widgets": {"csp": "on"}}, "robots": "follow, index, noarchive", "keywords": "Brooklyn Law School, Nick Allard, Brooklyn, NYC, Columbian Lawyers Association of Brooklyn, Ellen Spodek", "abstract": "No good deed goes unskewered at upcoming Brooklyn Law School Roast", "news_keywords": "Brooklyn Law School, Nick Allard, Brooklyn, NYC, Columbian Lawyers Association of Brooklyn, Ellen Spodek"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcbb9\"", "article_summary": "Call 718-625-2200, or go to the Brooklyn Law School web site.\nHe\u2019s been visible \u2014 practically fearless \u2014 innovative and determined to guide Brooklyn Law School to what he believes to be its rightful high place in the legal firmament.\nBoth venues are located at Brooklyn Law School\u2019s Feil Hall at 205 State St.\nLeading the Columbians this year is President Bartholomew Russo, aided by a talented team composed of First Vice President Rose Ann C.
