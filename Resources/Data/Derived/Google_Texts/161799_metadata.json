If the end of 2014 foreshadows the president\u2019s next set of moves, Republicans will not be amused.\n\nPresident Barack Obama knows how to get under Republicans\u2019 skin (in so many ways, but in this case we\u2019re talking about going around Congress to get things done), and he ended 2014 with a bang: A climate deal with China. Executive action on immigration. A move to normalize relations with Cuba.\n\nAs he makes his New Year\u2019s resolutions, the liberated, second-term, post-midterm president\u2019s list may well include some new maneuvers to enrage the opposition party. Here are five ways he could do it again in 2015.\n\nKeystone\n\nYou already know more than you ever thought you would about oil-sands crude, right? TransCanada Corp. wants to complete an $8 billion, 1,179-mile pipeline starting in the Canadian province of Alberta and running 830,000 barrels of oil per day through Nebraska into a network to refineries in Texas and Louisiana. While Obama cares about the Keystone XL project in the context of foreign policy and maintaining good relations with neighbor, ally and trading partner Canada, in 2012 he blocked it because of concerns in Nebraska and kicked it to the State Department for more study.\n\nNow, incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, said he wants to start the new Congress by taking up a bill by Senator John Hoeven, a North Dakota Republican, to approve Keystone under congressional authority. Environmentalists and major Democratic donor Tom Steyer are fighting the project, saying it will worsen global warming and could trigger toxic spills. Republicans largely back the project, saying it can create jobs and reduce gas prices. Opponents say such benefits are greatly overstated or downright irrelevant, given how low gas prices have fallen lately.\n\nObama was coy throughout the midterms about which way he\u2019ll go, maintaining that it was in the State Department\u2019s hands and that he would weigh the pros and cons. But he doesn\u2019t want Congress to tell him what to do. And in recent weeks, he\u2019s hinted strongly that he\u2019s turned against Keystone XL. He told comedian Stephen Colbert that while it would be good for Canada, \u201cit\u2019s not going to push down gas prices here in the United States,\u201d and that any economic benefit must be weighed against contributing to the warming of the earth, \u201cwhich could be disastrous.\u201d In his year-end news conference, the president said that \u201cit\u2019s not even going to be a nominal benefit to U.S. consumers.\u201d Asked whether he was issuing a veto threat, he demurred. \u201cI\u2019ll see what they do,\u201d he said of Republicans in Congress. \u201cWe\u2019ll take that up in the new year.\u201d\n\nCampaign finance reform\n\nSo-called dark-money nonprofits, such as those affiliated with the Koch brothers, could find it much harder to muck around in elections. Under current practices, up to half of these groups\u2019 money can be spent on politics. Changes to the Internal Revenue Service regulations governing 501(c)(4) social welfare organizations could shrink the percentage they can devote to election activities such as advertising. Overall, the aim would be to make it more difficult for any nonprofit group to engage in campaign politics; in practice, it would likely be perceived as a disproportionate handicap of conservative donor-backed organizations. These are among the reforms that the administration, regulatory groups or Congress could take on if so inclined (which Congress probably is not).\n\nClimate change\n\nThink power plants and methane.\n\nLast year, Obama proposed power-plant standards Republicans oppose to reduce carbon dioxide by 26 percent by 2020 and 30 percent by 2030 from 2005 levels. The standards are set to be issued in June, and then states will have another year to adopt their own plans to carry the standards out. McConnell will make it a top priority to try to stop Obama, either by blocking funding to carry out the policy or by changing provisions of the Clean Air Act, said David Doniger, director of the Natural Resources Defense Council climate and clean air program. \u201cIt will be fought over by the Republicans all through the year,\u201d he said. \u201cThere will be lots of lawsuits and so on. But the administration\u2019s very committed to this.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s another front on which the administration is expected to move early in the new year: setting standards to curb the leakage of methane, or natural gas. Raw methane emitted into the air is 36 times more heat-trapping than carbon dioxide, Doniger said, so stopping the leakage of methane at well pads, processing plants and pipelines could have a big impact. The administration had promised a proposal by the end of 2014 but it\u2019s getting pushed to 2015. \u201cIt\u2019s the biggest opportunity to cut climate pollution that they haven\u2019t already seized,\u201d he said. Setting standards would likely translate to increased inspections and mandatory repairs.\n\nPardons\n\nWe\u2019re not talking Bill Clinton-Marc Rich kinds of pardons. We\u2019re talking about non-violent prisoners incarcerated on drug charges and other such offenses.\n\nThis is a social-justice issue\u2014and to a large degree, a racial-justice issue\u2014for Obama. He was talking about it long before Michael Brown\u2019s killing in Ferguson, Mo., and other incidents renewed a debate about criminal justice, race, police abuses and sentencing. In late December, Obama granted clemency to 20 people, most of whom had been locked up on drug charges. Administration officials signaled months earlier that the scope of what Obama and his attorney general are considering could ultimately affect hundreds or thousands of incarcerated Americans.\n\nFederal prosecutor Loretta Lynch, Obama\u2019s nominee to succeed outgoing Attorney General Eric Holder, has a record of experience with cases involving police and the treatment of minorities, including her work on the team prosecuting New York City police officers accused of sodomizing a Haitian immigrant. (One officer pleaded guilty; another officer\u2019s conviction was overturned on appeal.) If confirmed, Lynch will be the first black female U.S. attorney general.\n\nNuclear deal with Iran\n\nThe P5+1\u2014the U.S., along with China, France, Germany, Russia and the U.K.\u2014are seeking limits to Iran\u2019s nuclear program through negotiations in exchange for the easing of sanctions. Negotiators didn\u2019t meet a Nov. 24 deadline and agreed to a seven-month extension. While Iran insists its interest lies in energy and other civilian uses, the U.S. and allies suspect Iran of trying to get an atomic bomb. Obama has expressed skepticism of the deal\u2019s prospects but said that it\u2019s worth trying.\n\nMany congressional Republicans\u2014and some Democrats\u2014say Iran can\u2019t be trusted and want to go in the opposite direction, pushing for more sanctions. Senator Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican and possible presidential candidate, said on Fox News in mid-December that \u201cIran was struggling under sanctions. They were on the point of collapse, and Obama, just like he\u2019s doing with Cuba, stepped in with a lifeline, relaxed sanctions, and is in the process of trying to negotiate a very, very bad deal.\u201d Conservative media outlets also are gearing up in opposition to Obama\u2019s approach. And a former U.S. Marine being held prisoner by Iranian authorities has expressedconcerns that his fate is becoming tied to the nuclear negotiations.\n\nBut in an interview in November with ABC News, Obama sounded a note of optimism. While gaps between the countries are \u201cstill significant,\u201d he said, he was \u201cconfident that if we reach a deal that is verifiable and ensures that Iran does not have breakout capacity, that not only can I persuade Congress, but I can persuade the American people that it\u2019s the right thing to do.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Bloomberg Politics explains how President Obama can have some fun in 2015.
