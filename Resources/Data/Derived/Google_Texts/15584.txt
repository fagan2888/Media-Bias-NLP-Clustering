A fake Native American head was found early Tuesday in the lap of a statue of Andrew Jackson in Jacksonville, Florida.

It is still unclear who placed the head on the statue, not to mention why, but many on Twitter and Facebook have been quick to point out that Jackson was responsible for the Indian Removal Act of 1830, leading to the Trail of Tears and the forced relocation and subsequent deaths of thousands of Native Americans.

It’s also unclear how exactly the head was placed on the statue since shrubbery and a chain link fence surround the statue, according to CBS 47 WJAX-TV, and Jackson’s lap is approximately 15 to 20 feet high. The statue is stationed in front of Jacksonville Landing, a prominent tourist complex in downtown Jacksonville.

Representatives from Jacksonville Sheriff’s Office were unavailable for comment at the time of publication.

The head was placed sometime Monday evening and crews used a crane to remove it before 7:30 a.m., according to Russell Colburn of WJAX-TV.

Recently, renewed efforts to replace Jackson’s image from the $20 bill have gained media attention. Support for Harriet Tubman has been popular, and Wilma Mankiller particularly popular with Native Americans.

The city of Jacksonville was named after President Jackson in 1832.
