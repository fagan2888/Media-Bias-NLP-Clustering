Jon Stewart is finally opening up about why he is leaving “The Daily Show.”

And while he had many choice things to say — “I think of us as turd miners” — it seems the main reason for his departure from the anchor desk is actually the main reason audiences want him to stay, the 2016 presidential election.

“I’d covered an election four times, and it didn’t appear that there was going to be anything wildly different about this one,” Stewart said in a lengthy profile in the Guardian.

He said that leaving at a time with a big event was also better for his successor, Trevor Noah.

“I also felt that, for the show, you don’t want to leave when the cupboard’s bare. So I think it’s a better introduction when you have something providing you with assisted fuel, like a presidential campaign,” Stewart added.

Stewart also offered up an extremely apt comparison for all of the media fervor that has accompanied the announcement of his “retirement.”

“If Oprah can leave and the world still spins, I honestly think it will survive me.”
