Ohio\u2019s labor force shrank by 60,832 during the same period.\n\nThrough July, Ohio had gained only 9,500 private-sector jobs this year \u2014 a growth rate ranking 41st of the 50 states.\n\nJobsOhio, a quasi-private restructuring of the Ohio Department of Development, has been the centerpiece of Gov. John Kasich\u2019s economic policy since he took office in 2011. Free-market think tank Opportunity Ohio says it\u2019s not working.\n\nIn a recent white paper, Opportunity Ohio president Matt Mayer pointed out JobsOhio projections of jobs added or retained through the agency have often exceeded the whole state\u2019s actual employment growth.\n\n\u201cOnce you strip away the fancy rhetoric and unprovable claims, JobsOhio is little more than a taxpayer-funded gambling operation that hopes its method of corporate cronyism hits the jackpot enough to hide the bad bets it makes,\u201d Mayer wrote.\n\nRELATED: Ohio economy falling behind right-to-work neighbor Michigan\n\nThe governor\u2019s office did not respond to questions from Ohio Watchdog about JobsOhio, the Opportunity Ohio paper or Ohio\u2019s job creation rate.\n\nWhile the Kasich administration emphasizes individual JobsOhio success stories in bringing businesses to the state or keeping existing employers from leaving, Department of Labor data show Ohio\u2019s overall economy losing steam after a promising 2011.\n\nAbsent a sudden turnaround, 2015 will be Ohio\u2019s worst year since the recession, with fewer jobs created than in 2010 under former governor Ted Strickland.\n\nIn March, Kasich noted Ohio had finally reached the break-even point after a net loss of 346,200 jobs during Strickland\u2019s tenure. By July, net private-sector job creation since January 2011 had dropped to 328,200.\n\nJobsOhio, Mayer said in an email to Ohio Watchdog, is fundamentally \u201cno different than every other economic development entity that has or will exist.\u201d\n\n\u201cGovernment planners will never be good at picking winners and losers no matter how smart or hardworking they might be,\u201d Mayer opined. \u201cOnly markets can determine which companies succeed or fail.\u201d\n\nKasich, a Republican, points to Ohio\u2019s job losses under Strickland, a Democrat, as proof Ohioans should grade on a curve when it comes to the state\u2019s economic recovery.\n\nStrickland \u201cwas clearly in over his head, but he was hit by a global tsunami,\u201d Mayer said, calling it \u201cdisingenuous\u201d for Kasich\u2019s allies to applaud better job numbers than Strickland\u2019s when Ohio still trails the national average.\n\nMayer said JobsOhio\u2019s funding would be better directed at infrastructure, education or tax cuts, but he does not expect the Republican-controlled Ohio General Assembly to back away from Kasich\u2019s signature jobs program.\n\nKasich has ferociously defended JobsOhio for the past four years. In January 2013, Kasich called left-wing activist group ProgressOhio and the libertarian 1851 Center for Constitutional Law \u201cnihilists\u201d for criticizing JobsOhio.\n\nProgressOhio\u2019s Ohio Supreme Court case against JobsOhio \u2014 a taxpayer-funded nonprofit with less transparency than a traditional government agency \u2014 was \u201can effort to destroy jobs in this state,\u201d Kasich said.\n\nMonths later, Kasich\u2019s spokesman said Ohio Auditor Dave Yost\u2019s attempts to examine JobsOhio\u2019s books would \u201ckill JobsOhio and its job creation efforts.\u201d Soon after, the General Assembly passed legislation limiting the auditor\u2019s access to JobsOhio records.\n\nOn the presidential campaign trail, Kasich has been critical of politicians wooing employers with targeted incentives.\n\nIn a Chicago Tribune interview in September, Kasich said Chicago \u201ccan\u2019t keep keeping jobs here by passing little sweetheart deals to Sears and anybody else so they don\u2019t leave. This has to be structurally improved.\u201d\n\nA 2012 Dayton Daily News investigation found that JobsOhio approved business incentives totaling almost $500 million in its first year alone.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Four years after the creation of publicly-funded economic development agency JobsOhio, Ohio's job growth has taken a nosedive.", "og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Four years after the creation of publicly-funded economic development agency JobsOhio, Ohio's job growth has taken a nosedive.", "title": "Is JobsOhio failing Ohio workers? - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/10/jobsohio-logo-300px.gif", "updated_time": "2015-10-09T15:33:51+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/241802/is-jobsohio-failing/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Four years after the creation of publicly-funded economic development agency JobsOhio, Ohio's job growth has taken a nosedive.", "title": "Is JobsOhio failing Ohio workers? - Watchdog.org", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/10/jobsohio-logo-300px.gif"}, "creator": "@jasonahart", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "News", "published_time": "2015-10-12T04:00:35+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-09T15:33:51+00:00"}, "news_keywords": "ohio department of development, jobs ohio, john kasich, matt mayer, opportunity ohio, ohio job growth, ohio economic growth, ohio job creation, ohio job growth rate"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0afc\"", "article_summary": "RELATED: Ohio economy falling behind right-to-work neighbor MichiganThe governor\u2019s office did not respond to questions from Ohio Watchdog about JobsOhio, the Opportunity Ohio paper or Ohio\u2019s job creation rate.\nFour years after the creation of publicly funded economic development agency JobsOhio, Ohio\u2019s job growth has taken a nosedive.\nThrough July, Ohio had gained only 9,500 private-sector jobs this year \u2014 a growth rate ranking 41st of the 50 states.\nJobsOhio, a quasi-private restructuring of the Ohio Department of Development, has been the centerpiece of Gov.\nBased on seasonally adjusted U.S. Department of Labor data for all 50 states, Ohio\u2019s rate of private-sector job growth from January 2011 through July ranked 28th."}
