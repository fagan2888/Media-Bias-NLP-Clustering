RIVERTON, Wyo. (AP) - The state will decide a controversial land purchase next week that would expand a prison farm.

The Ranger reports (http://bit.ly/1VScOHe) about 100 people spoke against the Honor Farm expansion plan, which would purchase 108 acres of land in an area farmed by families.

Concerns included possible decreased property values, privacy and harassment from inmates who work the farm.

Wyoming Department of Corrections director Bob Lampert says the land northeast of the main farm is the best available to meet needs.

The farm’s productive land decreased 40 percent after the state sold 302 acres determined to be best suited for commercial development.

Warden Mike Pacheco said neighbors’ safety is the priority.

State Lands and Investment Board director Bridget Hill plans to make a recommendation Monday.

The state’s decision is expected Tuesday.
