You may reach a federal marketplace representative by phone, 1-800-318-2596. Shoppers must select a plan by Dec. 15 for coverage to begin on Jan. 1. Open enrollment ends on Jan. 31. For additional information about Affordable Care Act plans in South Carolina, go to the Department of Insurance\u2019s website, doi.sc.gov.\n\nNext year, staring down a steep price hike, 63-year-old Simmons wonders if he\u2019ll be able to afford health insurance at all. \u201cI might just have to drop myself off completely and not have any coverage,\u201d he said.\n\nIt\u2019s decision-making season for Affordable Care Act customers. Open enrollment for 2016 health plans on HealthCare.gov started this month and runs through Jan. 31, but shoppers looking for coverage on Jan. 1 must pick a plan by mid-December. In South Carolina, they\u2019re facing higher prices, fewer options and narrow networks.\n\nSimmons, who owns a small appliance shop, said his relatively low income qualifies his family for a generous federal subsidy to offset the price they pay. But the amount they\u2019ll be expected to contribute in 2016 will still increase considerably. Next year, a comparable plan will cost them more than $600 a month.\n\n\u201cWhat a jump! I could not believe it,\u201d Simmons said. \u201cI\u2019m not good at math, but I think that\u2019s a 500 percent increase.\u201d\n\nIn 2014 and 2015, Simmons picked an insurance plan sold by Consumers\u2019 Choice Health Plan, which offered some of the lowest prices for South Carolina customers on HealthCare.gov. Consumers\u2019 Choice announced last month it will not sell 2016 plans. Several other similar health insurance co-ops across the country also recently closed as they faced a sharp cut in federal reimbursement.\n\nFour companies will continue selling policies to South Carolina customers, but only BlueCross BlueShield of South Carolina and its subsidiary, Blue Choice Health Plan, offer plans in every county.\n\nShelli Quenga works for the nonprofit Palmetto Project in Mount Pleasant. Her group won a federal grant to help residents enroll in health insurance plans through the federal marketplace. The Consumers\u2019 Choice announcement took them all by surprise, she said.\n\n\u201cA lot of people were really worried about affordability,\u201d she said. Consumers\u2019 Choice offered lower prices than most of its competitors, she said, but it also diversified South Carolina\u2019s insurance industry, long dominated by BlueCross BlueShield.\n\nNow, she said, \u201cFor most of the state, it is \u2018Blue\u2019 or \u2018Blue.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAccess to MUSC\n\nBut higher prices aren\u2019t the only problem former Consumers\u2019 Choice customers are confronting.\n\nSome of them are also struggling to find a plan that covers services at Medical University Hospital. The Medical University of South Carolina and its 1,500 physicians aren\u2019t considered \u201cin-network\u201d for BlueCross BlueShield or Blue Choice plans sold on HealthCare.gov.\n\nAetna-Coventry, which previously prioritized Roper St. Francis providers in its network, now offers a handful of plans that include MUSC as a preferred provider.\n\nBlueCross BlueShield of South Carolina and Blue Choice patients who purchase policies on the Affordable Care Act exchange may use MUSC doctors, but they should expect to pay much higher out-of-network prices.\n\nMUSC spokeswoman Heather Woolwine said the hospital wants to work with BlueCross BlueShield of South Carolina so that they may be included in the \u201cBlue\u201d network.\n\nSo far, they haven\u2019t reached an agreement.\n\nPatti Embry-Tautenhan, a spokeswoman for BlueCross BlueShield of South Carolina, pointed out that its Affordable Care Act plans include access to three other hospital systems in the Charleston area: Trident Health, Roper St. Francis and East Cooper Medical Center. \u201cThere are currently no plans to include MUSC in the 2016 individual ACA (Affordable Care Act) product network at this time,\u201d she said.\n\nThese restrictions do not affect BlueCross BlueShield customers insured through their employer or who qualify for the low-income Medicaid program or Medicare.\n\n\u2018All about money\u2019\n\nMore than 165,000 South Carolinians purchased Obamacare policies last year. S.C. Department of Insurance Director Ray Farmer said 67,000 of them were insured through Consumers\u2019 Choice.\n\n\u201cWe would encourage people to continue to shop, either on the exchange or through their local insurance agent,\u201d Farmer said. \u201cThere are plenty of plans, plenty of options.\u201d\n\nNext year, adults who don\u2019t enroll in an insurance plan must pay the federal government $695 or 2.5 percent of their household income, whichever amount is greater. Premiums for most Affordable Care Act plans in South Carolina will increase by about 10 percent next year.\n\nPart of the problem, some experts say, is that Consumers\u2019 Choice priced its policies too low all along.\n\nSimmons hasn\u2019t decided what he\u2019ll do. He qualifies for a Medicare card in less than two years and doesn\u2019t have any pressing health problems. He may buy a policy for his 59-year-old wife and risk it himself without health insurance until he turns 65.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about money, of course,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re barely able to cover things. We\u2019re not starving to death, but we don\u2019t have a slush fund.\u201d\n\nReach Lauren Sausser at (843) 937-5598.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Obamacare customers in South Carolina face tough choices, FP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNewsMetro, \r\nMetro, Affordable Care Act,Health insurance,MUSC,Obamacare", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "Larry Simmons paid $58 a month in 2014 and $118 a month this year for an Obamacare insurance policy to cover his family of three in Summerville.", "title": "Obamacare customers in South Carolina face tough choices", "url": "http://www.postandcourier.com20151116/151119435/obamacare-customers-in-south-carolina-face-tough-choices", "image": {"url": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20151116/PC16/151119435/AR/0/AR-151119435.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20151116/PC16/151119435/AR/0/AR-151119435.jpg"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Larry Simmons paid $58 a month in 2014 and $118 a month this year for an Obamacare insurance policy to cover his family of three in Summerville.", "title": "Obamacare customers in South Carolina face tough choices", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "Post and Courier", "iphone": "Post and Courier", "googleplay": "Post and Courier"}, "id": {"ipad": 603721271, "iphone": 603721271, "googleplay": "com.Synapse.PandC"}}, "site": "@postandcourier", "image": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20151116/PC16/151119435/AR/0/AR-151119435.jpg?201511162143", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "metered": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6511264bdb6fa45c6bb985fb86d3ab2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 146078808769941}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 151119435}}, "keywords": "Obamacare customers in South Carolina face tough choices , FP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNewsMetro, \r\nMetro, Affordable Care Act,Health insurance,MUSC,Obamacare", "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-16T15:48:06Z", "modified_time": "2015-11-16T21:43:00Z", "author": "Lauren Sausser"}, "msvalidate.01": "05BAEC9D8820FA9F10D57DB6EB3C6192", "google-site-verification": "rAW9DX7yfiFF82k05QGF6LbZBkxcKxMTzAwNv0OCKAM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "Larry Simmons paid $58 a month in 2014 and $118 a month this year for an Obamacare insurance policy to cover his family of three in Summerville."}, "article_summary": "Four companies will continue selling policies to South Carolina customers, but only BlueCross BlueShield of South Carolina and its subsidiary, Blue Choice Health Plan, offer plans in every county.\nFor additional information about Affordable Care Act plans in South Carolina, go to the Department of Insurance\u2019s website, doi.sc.gov.\nPremiums for most Affordable Care Act plans in South Carolina will increase by about 10 percent next year.\nIn South Carolina, they\u2019re facing higher prices, fewer options and narrow networks.\nThe Medical University of South Carolina and its 1,500 physicians aren\u2019t considered \u201cin-network\u201d for BlueCross BlueShield or Blue Choice plans sold on HealthCare.gov."}
