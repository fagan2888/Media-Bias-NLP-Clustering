A chemical leak at a Lafayette recreation center on Saturday sent 22 people to a hospital.

Those taken to the hospital were suffering from coughing, nausea and vomiting, according to a news release from the city.

Fire and hazardous material squads who responded to the scene did not detect lingering gas or chemicals in the air on Saturday night.

Still, the recreation center will be closed to the public on Sunday. However, staff will open the building from noon to 5 p.m. so people can pick up things they had to leave during the evacuation.

It has not been determined if the center will re-open for public use on Monday when the Boulder County Health Department will test the water.

The city described the situation as a “potential chemical incident in the pool area” at the Bob L. Burger Recreation Center. The Lafayette Fire Department was called at 4:10 p.m.

Everyone at the center evacuated to a nearby elementary school, the news release said.

The Boulder County Hazardous Materials Team also responded and was investigating the cause.

The Daily Camera newspaper reported the chemical was chlorine. The center and the street approaching it, North Public Road, were closed.

Roughly a half dozen ambulances with personnel from the Lafayette Longmont and Mountain View Fire departments responded to the incident, the Camera reported.
