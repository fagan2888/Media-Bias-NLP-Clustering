ROCKY MOUNTAIN NATIONAL PARK — Officials at Rocky Mountain National Park are considering closing certain areas of the park on the busiest days if those areas get overcrowded and noisy. Last year, there were a record 3.4 million visitors.

Officials say too many people and vehicles are putting a burden on trails, roads and wildlife. Education chief Rick Fedorchak says on some days, people can’t find peace and quiet.

Weekends in the summer have long been busy in the park, but visitation has spread out through all seasons with snowshoeing and sledding in the winter, fall colors and elk rutting, spring flowers and, of course, beautiful summer days.

The biggest traffic day ever at Rocky Mountain National Park was Sept. 27, a fall day when officials counted 13,295 vehicles.
