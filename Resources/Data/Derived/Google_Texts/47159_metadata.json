Here\u2019s how it works.\n\nWhen the federal government breaks ground on a project, there\u2019s a good chance that schedule delays and management problems will follow closely behind.\n\nWhether it\u2019s an agency headquarters, a massive IT undertaking, or a random parking garage, the government has a history of project management troubles\u2014which usually come at taxpayers\u2019 expense.\n\nRelated: 5 Government Projects That Are Costing Us Billions\n\nThe latest troubled project is the renovation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\u2019s Washington, D.C. headquarters, which has already soared $120 million over budget.\n\nAs detailed in a new report by the Inspector General for the Board of Governors\u2014which oversees the CFPB\u2014the project is now expected to cost at least $215 million. That includes $145.1 million for construction and $70.7 million for architect-engineering fees, rent for temporary housing, moving costs and other expenses. IG Mark Bialek said the CFPB ignored agency procedures to secure funding approval and concluded that there is \u201cno sound basis\u201d to support the renovation project.\n\nThe auditor also said the agency was \u201cunable to locate any documentation\u201d for the project.\n\nThe report was released by the House Financial Services Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, which has previously been critical of the agency\u2019s renovation project. The committee has questioned why the agency is doing renovations on a rented building.\n\nRepublicans, who have long opposed the CFPB\u2019s very existence, were quick to jump on the IG\u2019s findings. They pointed out that the new total will work out to about $590 per square foot\u2014well above the $334 per square foot cost of the Trump World Tower, and the Bellagio Hotel and Casino, which cost $330 per square foot.\n\nIn a statement, chairman McHenry likened the CFPB\u2019s failure to produce project documentation with the IRS losing potentially incriminating emails.\n\n\u201cWhen they passed the Dodd-Frank Act, Democrats in Congress and the White House made the CFPB unaccountable to taxpayers and to Congress,\u201d Rep. Jeb Hensarling (R-TX) said in a statement. \"We\u2019re seeing the results of this dangerous unaccountability today in a Washington bureaucracy that is running amok, spending as much as it wants on whatever it wants. It\u2019s outrageous.\u201d\n\nStill, the cost of the CFPB\u2019s headquarters is well below the ballooning cost of the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s new building\u2014which is already running $1.5 billion over budget and 11 years behind schedule.\n\nCheck out other problem-plagued government projects costing billions here.\n\nTop Reads from the Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The agency charged with protecting consumers from being duped by greedy financial inst", "title": "Taxpayers Eat $120 Million Over Budget for CFPB", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/07/02/Taxpayers-Eat-120-Million-Over-Budget-CFPB", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/04232013_Richard_Cordray_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/07/02/Taxpayers-Eat-120-Million-Over-Budget-CFPB", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/04232013_Richard_Cordray_article.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@Briannaehley"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "The agency charged with protecting consumers from being duped by greedy financial inst", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd16f\"", "article_summary": "That includes $145.1 million for construction and $70.7 million for architect-engineering fees, rent for temporary housing, moving costs and other expenses.\nIG Mark Bialek said the CFPB ignored agency procedures to secure funding approval and concluded that there is \u201cno sound basis\u201d to support the renovation project.\nRelated: 5 Government Projects That Are Costing Us BillionsThe latest troubled project is the renovation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\u2019s Washington, D.C. headquarters, which has already soared $120 million over budget.\nWhether it\u2019s an agency headquarters, a massive IT undertaking, or a random parking garage, the government has a history of project management troubles\u2014which usually come at taxpayers\u2019 expense.\nThe report was released by the House Financial Services Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, which has previously been critical of the agency\u2019s renovation project."}
