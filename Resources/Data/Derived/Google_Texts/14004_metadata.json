In today\u2019s letter, ACLU-NCLF Legal Director Chris Brook explains that the federal Equal Access Act forbids schools from permitting some student groups while barring others. LLCA has a history of allowing noncurricular students organizations, including a campus Christian organization, Raptors for Christ, that has met on campus for five years.\n\n\u201cThe LGBTQ+ club does not seek special treatment,\u201d Brook writes in the letter. \u201cThey simply seek to be treated the same as other student groups on campus, a right guaranteed to them by the Equal Access Act.\u201d\n\nRead the entire letter by clicking here.", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 71966175060}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://pulse.ncpolicywatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/cropped-logo_shadow-square-270x270.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "At its November 12 meeting, the LLCA Board of Directors voted to suspend all student-run clubs after some community members challenged the new LGBTQ+ club.\nIn today\u2019s letter, ACLU-NCLF Legal Director Chris Brook explains that the federal Equal Access Act forbids schools from permitting some student groups while barring others.\n\u201cThe LGBTQ+ club does not seek special treatment,\u201d Brook writes in the letter.\n\u201cThey simply seek to be treated the same as other student groups on campus, a right guaranteed to them by the Equal Access Act.\u201dRead the entire letter by clicking here.\nLLCA has a history of allowing noncurricular students organizations, including a campus Christian organization, Raptors for Christ, that has met on campus for five years."}
