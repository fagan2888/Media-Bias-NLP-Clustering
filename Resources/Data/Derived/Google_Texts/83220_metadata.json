Gov. Jerry Abramson is resigning after President Barack Obama announced he's appointing Abramson as his liaison to state and local governments.\n\nAbramson's resignation will be effective November 13.\n\nAbramson will help state and local governments manage policy issues and challenges, such as infrastructure, natural disasters and public health.\n\n\u201cThis is a bittersweet moment for me and for our administration. Jerry and I have been friends for more than 30 years, and I chose him as my Lieutenant Governor because I knew that his extensive experience as longtime mayor of Louisville, his contagious enthusiasm and his knack for building momentum around new ideas would make him a great partner in leading our state,\u201d said Gov. Beshear. \u201cBut the White House noticed all those skills, too, and realized that he will take those same gifts and put them to work on our nation\u2019s domestic agenda. He will be an outstanding addition to the President\u2019s administration, and we will miss him terribly.\u201d\n\nIn announcing the move, Gov. Steve Beshear appointed former state Auditor Crit Luallen to lieutenant governor. In April, Luallen announced she will not run for governor in 2015.\n\n\u201cCrit is a well-known and beloved public servant, respected by members of both parties for her resolute pursuit of clean, ethical government,\u201d said Gov. Beshear.\n\n\u201cShe was my first and only choice to serve as the new Lieutenant Governor, and I know Kentuckians will be confident that she is more than up to the task,\" Gov. Beshear said. \"I\u2019m glad she agreed to return to state government, and I\u2019m certain she will bring that same tenacity and grit to the Lt. Governor\u2019s office.\u201d\n\nLuallen has also served in the past as state budget director, secretary of the Governor's Executive Cabinet, secretary of the Finance and Administration Cabinet and secretary of the Tourism Cabinet.\n\nLuallen worked for six Kentucky Governors before serving two terms as auditor. In 2001, she received the National Excellence in Leadership Award by Women Executives in State Government. In 2009, 'Governing' magazine named her Public Official of the Year for her positive impact on Kentucky.\n\n\u201cIt is a high honor to stand here today in partnership with this Governor,\u201d said Luallen. \u201cServing as Lieutenant Governor gives me an opportunity to continue to serve Kentucky and offer my experience and perspective to Gov. Beshear and the fine team he has assembled. It will be my personal goal to help the Governor end his term in office with the state in as strong a position as possible to face the challenges the future holds.\u201d\n\n\u201cCrit Luallen has served state government in a variety of ways over the years, so she certainly will bring a wealth of information to the administration. I wish her the best as she takes on this responsibility,\u201d said Speaker Greg Stumbo.\n\n\u201cI have great respect for Crit Luallen,\u201d said Kentucky State Senate President Robert Stivers. \u201cShe and I have always worked well together, professionally and personally, and I look forward to that relationship continuing with Lt. Gov. Luallen. On behalf of the Kentucky Senate, we would like to wish Jerry Abramson the best in his new role in the Obama administration.\u201d\n\nLuallen will be sworn-in during a private ceremony at 5 p.m. November 13, the moment Abramson's resignation becomes effective.\n\nA public swearing-in is scheduled for November 14 at 2:30 p.m. in the Capitol Rotunda.\n\nAbramson is known as Louisville's \"Mayor for Life\" after serving 21 years - the longest tenure in the city's history.\n\nGov. Steve Beshear chose Abramson as his running mate when running for re-election in 2011.\n\nAs Lt. Governor, Abramson served as chair of the Blue Ribbon Commission on Tax Reform, launched a statewide version of a program he created while mayor of Louisville to help high school students apply to college, and chaired the kyhealthnow initiative.\n\nOne of Abramson's duties will be to help coordinate with states on the upcoming second open enrollment under Obama's health care law.\n\nAbramson brings unique experience as chair of Kentucky's health care initiative. Kentucky was an Obamacare success story, with more than 400,000 people signing up under the state's health insurance exchange.\n\n\u201cThe challenges that face America\u2019s local communities \u2013 such as workforce training, education, infrastructure investment, shrinking budgets, affordable housing, public transportation, and emergency response \u2013 are the issues that I\u2019ve worked on for more than 30 years in local and state government. I\u2019m honored to be in a position to help this country\u2019s mayors, county executives, governors and other local officials tackle these issues and work to find innovative solutions,\u201d said Lt. Gov. Abramson. \u201cI\u2019m grateful to Gov. Beshear for bringing me on board three years ago, and I\u2019m proud of the work we\u2019ve done together to bring jobs to our state and to strengthen Kentucky families. My experience in the Kentucky Capitol will be vital as I step into my new role.\u201d\n\nIn August 2013, Abramson who is one of the state's top Democrats took himself out of contention for governor, announcing two years early that he won't run.\n\nAbramson made the announcement just days after his wife, Madeline, told reporters that she's recovering from breast cancer.\n\nThe Louisville Democrat was considered one of the strongest contenders to replace term-limited Gov. Steve Beshear in 2015.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Gov. Steve Beshear announced Thursday morning that Lt. Gov.
