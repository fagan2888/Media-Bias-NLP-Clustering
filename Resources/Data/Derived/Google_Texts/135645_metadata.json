Eleanor Clift on how Obama talked up his plan\u2014and what Clinton feared.\n\nCould the dialogue about the new health-care law get any more surreal? On one television network, Texas Republican Ted Cruz drones on and on about the evils of Obamacare, and on another, Democratic Presidents Obama and Clinton do their best to sell a skeptical American public on the new health-care law, sounding a bit like the Home Shopping Network as they put in a plug for people to go online to HealthCare.gov and sign up for coverage.\n\nSeated in cream-colored easy chairs on the set of Clinton\u2019s annual Global Initiative confab in New York, the two presidents engaged in some friendly banter about how they both married up. Then they got down to business, with Clinton posing the questions on people\u2019s minds, from why the president took on health-care reform to why the law is so unpopular. Obama had a rare chance to explain the basis for Obamacare and to promote a spate of recent good news that suggests premiums for many people will be lower than expected.\n\n\n\nOn October 1, just a week away, the health-care exchanges will be up and running to enroll people for coverage that will take effect in January. It\u2019s important for everybody, every category, every age group, Obama said, to understand why health insurance is important, why they should sign up, and what choices are available to them. \u201cShop just like you shop for an airline ticket or a flat-screen TV,\u201d Obama said. Making it simple and straightforward is the best defense against the GOP\u2019s assault on the law, which includes commercials with a demented-looking Uncle Sam peering between a woman\u2019s legs. Calling the commercials \u201ca little wacky,\u201d Obama said, \u201cjust go to HealthCare.gov and make your own decision \u2026 What we are confident of is that when people look and see they can get quality health care for less than their cellphone bill, they will sign up.\u201d\n\nClinton played the role of mildly skeptical interrogator, asking at one point if it\u2019s such a good idea, why do the polls show it\u2019s so unpopular? And then, as their nearly hourlong conversation drew to a close, Clinton said the question he gets the most is that Obamacare sounds too good to be true. You spend more, give more people health coverage, and the deficit goes down. How can that be?\n\nObama explained how pooling risk eliminates the expensive cost-shifting when emergency rooms provide care and pass the costs along. He also acknowledged raising taxes\u2014gasp\u2014on higher-income Medicare recipients and on so-called Cadillac plans, which has labor unions in a tizzy, and reducing the subsidies for Medicare Advantage plans. He said he sympathized with Republican governors facing a political litmus test but said he believes that once they realize what a good deal they\u2019re getting, they will come around. He pointed to three states\u2014Arkansas, Kentucky, and Idaho\u2014that he lost in the last election by 20 percentage points and said they are implementing Obamacare by another name.\n\nIn Kentucky, it\u2019s Kentucky Connect, and in Idaho, where it\u2019s the Idaho Health Care Exchange, he related a story of a fellow looking at the rates, signing up, and declaring to his friend, \u201cThis is a great deal; this is a lot better than Obamacare.\u201d \u201cWhich is fine,\u201d Obama continued. \u201cI don\u2019t have pride of authorship. I just want the thing to work.\u201d He noted that in New York, California, and Illinois, all Obama-friendly states that have been working aggressively to get their exchanges up and running, premiums are significantly lower than what was expected\u201450 percent lower in New York; 33 percent lower in California; and 25 percent lower in Illinois. \u201cCompetition and choice work,\u201d Obama said.\n\nClinton said that at one point he was \u201cterrified\u201d there would be no private competition, that only one insurer would show up. Instead, more companies are doing more bidding, he said.\n\nWith two policy wonks like Clinton and Obama talking health care, it was to be expected that the discussion would get fairly technical, and it did, with quite a lengthy explanation of why the health-care law contains both employer and individual mandates, which Obama said are the primary cause of controversy around the plan. Employers simply don\u2019t like to be told they have to provide coverage, and people don\u2019t like to be told they have to have coverage, he said.\n\nObama showcased the benefits already in place, among them prohibiting insurance companies from discriminating against people with preexisting conditions. But if insurance companies have got to provide coverage to all comers, he said, the flip side is everybody\u2019s got to have insurance. It\u2019s the same principle that motivated Gov. Mitt Romney\u2019s health-care plan in Massachusetts, \u201cand that principle was considered a very smart Republican principle,\u201d Obama said.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "eleanorclift"}, "keywords": "Clinton Global Initiative, u.s. poli", "publicationDate": 201309250109, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/features/2013/inside-the-united-nations-general-assembly-and-clinton-global-initiative", "description": "The two Democratic presidents played Obamacare salesmen at the Clinton Global Initiative on Tuesday.
