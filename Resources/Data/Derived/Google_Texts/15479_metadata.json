It's expected to return images by Monday.\n\nRosetta has been flying alongside the comet since August and recently orbited at an altitude of around 26 kilometers (16 miles).\n\nRosetta in November released the Philae lander to the comet's surface. Philae returned reams of data before depleted batteries silenced it.\n\nMission controllers want to pin down Philae's location on the comet and hope its solar panel-powered battery will recharge as it
