You don\u2019t have to belong if you don\u2019t want to. So if I go to an organizing drive, I can tell these workers, \u2018If you don\u2019t like this arrangement, you don\u2019t have to belong,\u2019 versus, \u2018If we get 50 percent of you, then all of you have to belong, whether you like to or not.\u2019 I don\u2019t even like the way that sounds, because it\u2019s a voluntary system, and if you don\u2019t think the system\u2019s earning its keep, then you don\u2019t have to pay.\u201d\n\nRight-to-work laws, now in 24 states, including Michigan, Florida and Indiana, prohibit firing workers for choosing not to join a labor union or pay dues.\n\nCasteel\u2019s point, at least at the time, was that unions have and can continue to prove their worth to the worker. Fine, say right-to-work proponents, but let the employee ultimately say.\n\nPublic-sector employees have had their say in Wisconsin, where the state\u2019s Act 10 reformed the state\u2019s longstanding and pioneering government collective-bargaining law. Given the choice, public employees in pretty significant numbers have left their unions and their compulsory dues.\n\nThe Wisconsin Education Association Council lost more than a third of its membership, declining from about 98,000 to about 60,000 members following implementation of Act 10 in 2011, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nAmerican Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Council 24\u2019s dues-paying membership fell from about 5,900 security and safety employee members pre-Act 10 to 690 in the early months of 2013 \u2014 an 88 percent drop.\n\n\n\nRead more at Watchdog.org\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "Gary Casteel, secretary-treasurer of the United Auto Workers, said he prefers organizing in a right-to-work environment.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Gary Casteel, secretary-treasurer of the United Auto Workers, said he prefers organizing in a right-to-work environment.", "title": "UAW Boss: Right-to-Work Doesn\u2019t Hurt Unions, It Helps", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/uaw.png", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1zbJG06"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Gary Casteel, secretary-treasurer of the United Auto Workers, said he prefers organizing in a right-to-work environment.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/uaw.png"}, "title": "UAW Boss: Right-to-Work Doesn\u2019t Hurt Unions, It Helps", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Economy", "tag": "labor", "published_time": "2014-12-13T11:36:36+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "right-to-work, unions, uaw, right to work, labor, wisconsin"}, "article_summary": "Gary Casteel, secretary-treasurer of the United Auto Workers, said he prefers organizing in a right-to-work environment.\nCasteel\u2019s point, at least at the time, was that unions have and can continue to prove their worth to the worker.\nGiven the choice, public employees in pretty significant numbers have left their unions and their compulsory dues.\nPublic-sector employees have had their say in Wisconsin, where the state\u2019s Act 10 reformed the state\u2019s longstanding and pioneering government collective-bargaining law.\nYou don\u2019t have to belong if you don\u2019t want to."}
