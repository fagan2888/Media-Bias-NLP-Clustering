Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio believes more guns could be the answer to the recent epidemic of mass shootings around the country.

In the wake of high profile shootings, the gun lobby’s mantra – for years – has been “the only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun, is a good guy with a gun.” Following the slaying of 14 people in San Bernardino this week Sheriff Joe is doubling down on that belief.

“My goal of utilizing 250,000 citizens armed with concealed weapons is to stop the carnage, stop the killing before cops arrive,” said Sheriff Arpaio in a video posted to social media.

The sheriff’s goal of getting 250,000 armed citizens would be just under 10 percent of the Valley's population.

Many gun owners agree that more armed citizens might be the answer.

“I look at it as, it's true, everybody should be armed,” said Jayson Hoffer, owner of ValleyGunGroup.com. “Everybody should know what they're doing. Everyone should have some training.”

In addition to his gun group, Hoffer is a seller at Crossroads of the West Gun Show in Phoenix this weekend. Like many at the gun show he believes in the Second Amendment and his right to carry a gun at all times to defend himself. But he also said there should be a little personal responsibility that goes into carrying a weapon in public.

“Just having training, going through the concealed weapon class -- don't just buy a gun and think you know how to use it,” said Hoffer.

Meanwhile, many self-defense and law enforcement experts say the best thing to do in an active shooter situation is run or hide. The last resort should be to fight back.
