Very good grief

Charlie Brown may have his problems, but we'll say this for the ol' blockhead: He sure ages well. "A Charlie Brown Christmas" (8 p.m.), a holiday tradition right up there with "It's a Wonderful Life," is preceded this year by "It's Your 50th Christmas, Charlie Brown," a star-studded celebration featuring Sarah McLachlan, Boyz II Men and Kristin Chenoweth, who won a Tony for playing Sally on Broadway. 7 p.m. KSTP, Ch. 5

Turning the tables

W. Kamau Bell, Morgan Spurlock and Don Lemon try to prove they can operate without teleprompters on "CNN Quiz Show: Famous Americans," a charity event with teams of TV news personalities turning over their winnings to charities associated with Arthur Ashe, Willie Nelson and Alvin Ailey. Sounds like everyone's a winner. 8 p.m. CNN

Off target

TBS' underappreciated comedy "10 Items or Less" proved there are laughs to be had in a struggling store's aisles, as long as the staff is willing to throw the company handbook aside. "Superstore," which NBC is previewing before its official Jan. 4 launch, may have a bigger stage than that canceled series, but it's too generic to attract selective shoppers. Golden Globe winner America Ferrera is as charming as ever as the overly dedicated assistant manager who tries to rein in a crew that's supposedly too wacky, but none are really allowed to let their freak flags fly. 9 p.m. KARE, Ch. 11
