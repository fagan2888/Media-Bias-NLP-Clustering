Medicare enrollment may be denied or revoked if CMS determines the affiliation poses a fraud risk, the agency said.\n\nThe rule would also allow CMS to deny or revoke a provider's Medicare enrollment if they're currently revoked under a different name or business identity, or if the provider has a history of abusive drug prescribing.\n\nRemoving bad actors and fraud risks from Medicare saved the program an estimated $2.4 billion between 2011 and 2015, CMS said.\n\nClick here to read the full proposed rule.
