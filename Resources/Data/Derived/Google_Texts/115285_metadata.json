The rest of the vote was strictly party line. None of this was a surprise, as House Republicans are hellbent on extorting a repeal or delay of the ACA out of the president. They aren\u2019t going to get anything on Obamacare, but they have virtually guaranteed that the government will shutdown.\n\nThe hours of House debate were contentious. Democrats challenged Republicans by telling them that a vote to delay Obamacare was a vote in favor of a government shutdown. Republicans responded by with the ludicrous argument that they weren\u2019t voting for a government shutdown. They were voting to keep the government running. Around and around, the debate went for hours. No new ground was covered as Republicans were content to repeat their Obamacare lies on the House floor, and angry Democrats wondered what the ACA has to do with keeping the government running.\n\nWhether House Republicans want to admit it or not, there is a sizable contingent among their ranks who have been chasing after this moment since the day that they arrived in Washington. The idiot ideologues completed their takeover of the House Republicans tonight. They are firmly in charge now. John Boehner, Eric Cantor, and the rest of the House leadership were nowhere to be found as their party went down in flames.\n\nIt was as if the Republican leadership thought that if they stay away, they will avoid the blame for this entire situation. Out of sight, out of mind won\u2019t work on this one. Boehner\u2019s caving to the extremists is what caused this series of events to play out the way that they have.\n\nThe decision on when the likely government shutdown ends is still in Boehner\u2019s hands. Harry Reid and Barack Obama aren\u2019t going to bail the Republican Speaker out this time. Boehner\u2019s only way out is to pass a clean CR.\n\nThe entire country may be left waiting and wondering if John Boehner is capable of putting his man pants on, and standing up the House tea party extremists who are hellbent on economic destruction.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Like thieves in the night, House Republicans took a giant step towards shutting down the government by voting to put their poison pill of delaying the ACA for a year back into the CR.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Jason Easley", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "Like thieves in the night, House Republicans took a giant step towards shutting down the government by voting to put their poison pill of delaying the ACA for a year back into the CR.", "title": "Idiots Rule as House Republicans Vote to Shut Down the Government Over Obamacare", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2013/09/29/idiots-rule-house-republicans-vote-shut-government-obamacare.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/government-closed.jpg", "updated_time": "2013-09-29T00:41:22+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "Featured News,Government Shutdown,house obamacare government shutdown,house vote,house votes to delay obamacare,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,barack obama,hillary clinton,bernie sanders,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "Featured News", "published_time": "2013-09-29T00:41:22+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-29T00:41:22+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Government Shutdown, house obamacare government shutdown, house vote, house votes to delay obamacare"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfbe0\"", "article_summary": "Democrats challenged Republicans by telling them that a vote to delay Obamacare was a vote in favor of a government shutdown.\nThe final vote was 231-192 with 2 Democrats voted to delay Obamacare for a year, and two Republicans voted against it.\nNone of this was a surprise, as House Republicans are hellbent on extorting a repeal or delay of the ACA out of the president.\nThe idiot ideologues completed their takeover of the House Republicans tonight.\nWhether House Republicans want to admit it or not, there is a sizable contingent among their ranks who have been chasing after this moment since the day that they arrived in Washington."}
