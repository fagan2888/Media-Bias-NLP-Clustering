Destroyed by the monster he made.\"\n\nWestboro declined to say whether or not its patriarch has been excommunicated. The church's statement said that \"membership issues are private\" and that eight unnamed \"elders\" lead the Westboro congregation.\n\nA church spokesman declined to respond to follow-up questions.\n\nFred Phelps founded Westboro Baptist Church in 1955 and molded it in his fire-and-brimstone image. Most of the small congregation are members of Phelps' extended family. Nathan Phelps is one of several relatives who left the church in recent decades. He lives in Canada, according to his Facebook page.\n\nMORE ON CNN: 'Most-hated,' anti-gay preacher once fought for civil rights\n\nDespite its \"Baptist\" name, Westboro is not affiliated with any larger church denomination. Most Christians criticize the congregation's harsh anti-gay rhetoric and penchant for pursuing the limelight at inappropriate moments.\n\nAccording to the church's website, it has picketed more than 53,000 events, ranging from Lady Gaga concerts to funerals for slain U.S. soldiers. Typically, a dozen or so family members - including small children - brandish signs that say \"God Hates Fags\" and \"Thank God for Dead Soldiers.\"\n\nWestboro's website keeps a running tally of \"people whom God has cast into hell since you loaded this page.\"\n\nBy the church's idiosyncratic logic, God's damnation, including the death of U.S. soldiers, is the price to pay for the country's acceptance of \"sins\" such as homosexuality.\n\nDespite the protests' unpopularity, the Supreme Court upheld Westboro's right to picket military funerals on free speech grounds in 2011. Several states, though, have passed laws aimed at keeping the controversial church at a distance from funerals.\n\n\"I feel sad for all the hurt he's caused so many,\" Nathan Phelps said of his father on Sunday.\n\n\"I feel sad for those who will lose the grandfather and father they loved. And I'm bitterly angry that my family is blocking the family members who left from seeing him, and saying their good-byes.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "By\u00a0Daniel Burke, CNN Belief Blog Co-Editor (CNN) -- Westboro Baptist Church, the Kansas congregation known for picketing funerals with anti-gay signs, called reports that its founder, Fred Phelps, is near death \"speculative.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "title": "Westboro Baptist Church founder near death", "og": {"url": "http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2014/03/17/westboro-baptist-church-founder-near-death/", "image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/140317094013-restricted-fred-phelps-story-top.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "By\u00a0Daniel Burke, CNN Belief Blog Co-Editor\r\n\r\n\r\n(CNN) -- Westboro Baptist Church, the Kansas congregation known for picketing funerals with anti-gay signs, called reports that its founder, Fred Phelps, is near death \"speculative.", "title": "Westboro Baptist Church founder near death"}, "msvalidate.01": "DE341CAC7D45B696ED1776216C18054C", "fb": {"admins": 690014395, "app_id": 80401312489}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "CNN Belief Blog", "keywords": "pastors, fred phelps, westboro baptist church", "google-site-verification": "mFBa4OnyEDU23vgVJ6rtX_4izud7FIi9JiscfVsWaKk", "original-source": "http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2014/03/17/westboro-baptist-church-founder-near-death/", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/feed/;icon-uri=https://s2.wp.com/i/favicon.ico"}, "article_summary": "By Daniel Burke, CNN Belief Blog Co-EditorFollow @BurkeCNN(CNN) - Westboro Baptist Church, the Kansas congregation known for picketing funerals with anti-gay signs, called reports that its founder, Fred Phelps, is near death \"speculative.\"\nFred Phelps founded Westboro Baptist Church in 1955 and molded it in his fire-and-brimstone image.\nAnd I'm bitterly angry that my family is blocking the family members who left from seeing him, and saying their good-byes.\"\nMORE ON CNN: 'Most-hated,' anti-gay preacher once fought for civil rightsDespite its \"Baptist\" name, Westboro is not affiliated with any larger church denomination.\nTypically, a dozen or so family members - including small children - brandish signs that say \"God Hates Fags\" and \"Thank God for Dead Soldiers.\""}
