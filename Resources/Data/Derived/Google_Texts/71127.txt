Authorities said they shut down the White Deer Motel in Conway Friday due to dozens of fire code violations.

Forty-nine violations of the state fire code were found, the fire chief said.

The building, which has not operated as a motel in years, has been used for low-income-housing apartments.

Residents were only given a day to find another place to live after the building’s owners didn’t make the necessary changes, the fire chief said.

Authorities said they were responding to a medical aid call at the building recently when they were first alerted to the conditions inside.
