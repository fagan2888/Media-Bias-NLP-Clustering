Medicaid expansion seems like a dead issue this legislative session in Florida, but many lawmakers aren't giving up.

Republican State Sen. Rene Garcia of Hialeah called on members of the Florida Legislature to accept $51 billion in federal money to extend health care coverage to nearly 1 million uninsured.

Garcia is sponsoring a bill (SB 710) that would accept $51 billion in federal funding to expand a Medicaid alternative that would allow recipients to purchase private insurance. The Senate supported a similar bill last year, but the House did not.
