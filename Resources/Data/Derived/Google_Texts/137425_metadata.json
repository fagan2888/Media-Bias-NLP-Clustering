The knowledge that they will be shielded from deportation has drawn hundreds of thousands of Cubans on perilous raft trips to Florida and land journeys through Central America and Mexico.\n\n\u201cIf they take away the adjustment law, it would mean Cubans would end up just like all the other Hispanics who want to enter the United States,\u201d said Luis, a 36-year-old construction worker who said he may try to reach Mexico and walk across the border if he doesn\u2019t get a visa soon.\n\nU.S. officials say there are no immediate plans to change immigration laws or policy. But with the U.S. and Cuba negotiating a return to full diplomatic relations, many Cubans are wondering how long their extraordinary privilege can survive under restored diplomacy, and are thinking about speeding up plans to get to the U.S.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if they will take it away,\u201d Angela Moreno, a 67-year-old retiree said of the preferential treatment, \u201cbut if they do, Cubans who go to the United States will have to do it like people from other countries.\u201d\n\nCubans arriving at a U.S. border or airport automatically receive permission to stay in the United States under policies stemming from the 1966 act, which allows them to apply for permanent residency after a year, almost always successfully.\n\nSeeking to discourage mass migrations by sea, the United States developed its so-called \u201cwet foot, dry foot policy,\u201d in which migrants who make it to the U.S. are automatically allowed to stay. Those stopped at sea are either sent back to their homeland or to a third country if they can prove a credible fear of persecution.\n\nU.S. Sen. Bill Nelson, a Florida Democrat, said he welcomed President Barack Obama\u2019s move to create a \u201cmodern relationship\u201d with Cuba, but Congress is not likely to alter the Cuban Adjustment Act or the U.S. trade embargo, until there have been significant steps by the Castro government.\n\n\u201cMajor changes to a law like that or to the embargo are not going to happen unless people like me support those changes, and I\u2019m not going to support them unless I see some movement toward freedom\u201d Nelson told The Associated Press.\n\nHowever, the restoration of diplomatic relations could cause its own complications.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Detente spawns Cuban worry on US migration rights", "title": "Detente spawns Cuban worry on US migration rights", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Detente spawns Cuban worry on US migration rights", "title": "Detente spawns Cuban worry on US migration rights", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/12/25/detente_spawns_cuban_worry_on_us_migration_rights/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/12/cuba-us.jpeg17-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Detente spawns Cuban worry on US migration rights", "title": "Detente spawns Cuban worry on US migration rights", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/12/cuba-us.jpeg17-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Ben Fox and Anne-marie Garcia", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "For nearly a half-century, the Cuban Adjustment Act has given Cubans who arrive in the U.S. a virtually guaranteed path to legal residency and eventual citizenship.\nTopics: From the Wires, NewsHAVANA (AP) \u2014 Like tens of thousands of Cubans, Gerardo Luis wants to get to the United States and he\u2019s suddenly worried that time may be running out.\nSeeking to discourage mass migrations by sea, the United States developed its so-called \u201cwet foot, dry foot policy,\u201d in which migrants who make it to the U.S. are automatically allowed to stay.\nThe knowledge that they will be shielded from deportation has drawn hundreds of thousands of Cubans on perilous raft trips to Florida and land journeys through Central America and Mexico.\nU.S. Sen.
