In response to Joseph R. Maurer’s Feb. 2 letter, “Liberalism means progress,” I have “results” for him. The U.S. Constitution he claims for liberalism was actually founded on republicanism ideas. Our first conservative party president, Abraham Lincoln, had a few thoughts that served “We the people,” don’t you think?

Another that Maurer lists, the Civil Rights Act of 1964, was voted against by more Democrats than Republicans. The Affordable Care Act is on all liberals, just as he claims. Liberalism has progressively pushed toward socialism. The last seven years have seen the busiest socialistic changes to the people’s freedom ever.

Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., changed the Senate filibuster rules to help passage of President Obama’s “unaffordable care act.” More than 60 percent of America did not want it. Not one Republican voted for it; they did their job. Democrats snubbed the people, siding instead with a very liberal president.

Maurer did not include the legalized killing of unborn human babies as a liberal result, known as Roe vs. Wade. That’s a biggie. Not proud of that one?

Now where was I before the “liberal bias vs. fact” card was played? Oh yeah. God, family, country. Go Tea Party. Go anyone who is not a socialist, at the very least.
