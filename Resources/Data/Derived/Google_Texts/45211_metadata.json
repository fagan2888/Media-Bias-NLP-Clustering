Normally no one can keep a secret in my family, but it was an amazing surprise. I\u2019m so happy that he\u2019s here. He just showed up. He has a tournament soon, so he\u2019s got a lot of work (to do), and I\u2019m surprised that he was able to come all the way over here for a few hours to watch me ski.\u201d\n\nThat was the surprise of the day, because there was little suspense left in Vonn\u2019s chase of the record held for 35 years by Austria\u2019s Annemarie Moser-Proell. After Vonn\u2019s record-tying win in downhill on Sunday, it seemed inevitable she would break the record before coming to home to compete in the world alpine championships at Beaver Creek in two weeks.\n\n\u201cI felt no pressure,\u201d Vonn said. \u201cIn the start I felt really loose, I felt a lot better than I did (Sunday). (Sunday) I still was feeling pressure. For me it\u2019s just important to focus on the skiing. Everyone was talking about the record for so long that it definitely puts pressure on you. (Monday) I had no pressure, I was just skiing and doing the best I could. I felt like it was a training run, just pushing myself as hard as I could.\u201d\n\nVonn left her native Minnesota when she was 12 to join Ski & Snowboard Club Vail, which offered her a big mountain where she could become a downhiller. Now she has 32 World Cup wins in downhill and 21 in super-G.\n\nVonn\u2019s time of one minute, 27.03 seconds was 0.85 of a second ahead of runnerup Anna Fenninger of Austria. It was Vonn\u2019s first win in super-G since December 2012, two months before she blew out her right knee racing super-G at the world championships in Schladming, Austria.\n\nWATCH: John Meyer explains the significance of Lindsey Vonn\u2019s all-time World Cup wins record\n\n\u201cI was definitely pushing the limits the whole way down,\u201d Vonn said. \u201cSometimes I was a little bit out of control but I maintained the speed, especially on the bottom part of the course. I\u2019m so happy to finish the weekend with win No. 63. It\u2019s a really, really special day.\u201d\n\nWoods remained incognito as long as he could, wearing a mask to avoid attention from crowds.\n\n\u201cI was so surprised that he\u2019s here,\u201d Vonn said. \u201cHe has a tournament in like a week, so I didn\u2019t expect him to be here at all. It\u2019s really cool. The last time he was over in Europe for my race was Val d\u2019Isere (France, in 2013) and I was hurt. This is a totally different scenario and a much better memory that we can have forever.\u201d\n\nThe magnitude of Vonn\u2019s achievement goes beyond her personal list of achievements, which include four World Cup overall titles, Olympic medals in downhill (gold) and super-G (bronze) and five world championships medals. It means American children can dream about being the best in a sport long dominated by racers from Austria, Switzerland, Italy and France.\n\n\u201cHopefully this will bring more attention to the sport,\u201d Vonn said. \u201cI think it will be really good going into the world championships. Hopefully there will be some more TV interest, and more interest in general from the American public, especially in a non-Olympic year, but I always just try to promote the sport. I think it\u2019s an amazing sport.\u201d\n\nUniversal Sports Network will show Monday\u2019s race at 8 a.m. Denver time.\n\nJohn Meyer: 303-954-1616, jmeyer@denverpost.com or twitter.com/johnmeyer", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Lindsey Vonn breaks all-time record for women\u2019s World Cup wins with super-G victory", "title": "Lindsey Vonn breaks all-time record for women\u2019s World Cup wins with super-G victory", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/01/18/lindsey-vonn-breaks-all-time-record-for-womens-world-cup-wins-with-super-g-victory/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-01-19T05:43:02+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-19T05:43:02+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Alpine skiing"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcce75\"", "article_summary": "It\u2019s a really, really special day.\u201dWoods remained incognito as long as he could, wearing a mask to avoid attention from crowds.\nPHOTOS: Lindsey Vonn breaks World Cup wins recordLindsey Vonn got win No.\n\u201cHe told everyone to keep it a secret and I\u2019m surprised.\n\u201cHopefully this will bring more attention to the sport,\u201d Vonn said.\nWATCH: John Meyer explains the significance of Lindsey Vonn\u2019s all-time World Cup wins record\u201cI was definitely pushing the limits the whole way down,\u201d Vonn said."}
