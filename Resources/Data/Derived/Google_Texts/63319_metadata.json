Marco Rubio, R-Fla., the son of Cuban immigrants, said the decision \u201cis going to do absolutely nothing to further human rights and democracy in Cuba.\u201d\n\nInstead, he said, \u201cit potentially goes a long way in providing the economic lift that the Castro regime needs to become permanent fixtures in Cuba for generations to come.\u201d\n\nSen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., the Senate Foreign Relations Committee\u2019s outgoing chairman, said Obama\u2019s actions \u201chave vindicated the brutal behavior of the Cuban government.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s be clear,\u201d he said. \u201cThis was not a \u2018humanitarian\u2019 act by the Castro regime. It was a swap of convicted spies for an innocent American.\u201d\n\nMenendez said trading Gross \u201cfor three convicted criminals sets an extremely dangerous precedent.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt invites dictatorial and rogue regimes to use Americans serving overseas as bargaining chips. I fear that today\u2019s actions will put at risk the thousands of Americans that work overseas to support civil society, advocate for access to information, provide humanitarian services, and promote democratic reforms,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis asymmetrical trade will invite further belligerence toward Cuba\u2019s opposition movement and the hardening of the government\u2019s dictatorial hold on its people.\u201d\n\nWhat do YOU think of Obama\u2019s Cuba deal? Sound off in today\u2019s WND poll!\n\nPope Francis appeal\n\nLast spring, Obama authorized the opening of formal negotiations with Cuba to be directed by White House Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes and Ricardo Zuniga, senior director for Western Hemisphere Affairs in the National Security Council.\n\nAlthough the Canadian government did not participate in the talks, it hosted the majority of the meetings between U.S. and Cuban officials.\n\nThe White House disclosed Pope Francis personally issued an appeal through a letter to Cuban President Raul Castro and to Obama calling on the leaders to resolve the cases of Gross and the three members of the \u201cCuban Five\u201d imprisoned in the U.S.\n\nThe Vatican hosted and participated in meetings between U.S. and Cuban delegations in which normalization was discussed.\n\nThe White House further disclosed Pope Francis discussed Cuba with Obama in their private meeting at the Vatican March 27.\n\nMedia at the time reported the meeting produced \u201csocial schisms,\u201d with the pope expressing concerns about religious freedom in the U.S. and the Obamacare mandate requiring employers to provide for contraception and abortion services.\n\nThe White House made clear the Vatican played \u201ca key role\u201d in the negotiations re-establishing diplomatic relations and in finalizing the details of the prisoner exchange, noting that in Obama\u2019s personal meeting with Pope Francis, the issue of Cuba \u201cgot as much discussion as anything else.\u201d\n\n\u201cSupport of Pope Francis was important given the esteem with which Cubans hold Pope Francis, the first pope chosen from Latin America,\u201d a White House spokesman commented.\n\nThe White House further noted the announcement Wednesday was not focused on any legislative action Congress may take.\n\n\u201cWe believe the embargo has not worked, but we are not calling on Congress today to make any legislative changes,\u201d the White House spokesman said, acknowledging that President Obama had briefed congressional leaders. \u201cWe support congressional efforts to remove embargo restrictions, but we understand Congress is not likely to move quickly.\u201d\n\nThe White House said the president was calculating the benefits of the new approach to Cuba will become apparent to the American public and to Congress.\n\n\u201cWe believe the utility of these benefits will become evident and will generate momentum for legislative change in the near future,\u201d the White House spokesman continued.\n\nHe explained that, at the moment, President Obama was concentrating on putting in place changes in Cuban policy that the White House has the authority under law to implement through executive action.\n\n\u2018Policy of the past\u2019\n\nThe White House said an embassy will open in Havana as soon as possible.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said Wednesday, however, he will block federal funds from financing a future embassy in Cuba.\n\nThe administration believes the \u201cpolicy of past has not worked,\u201d and re-establishing diplomatic relations is the best way \u201cto bring democracy to Cuba.\u201d\n\nU.S. officials are to meet with Cuban dissidents in the U.S. to reassure them of Washington\u2019s commitment to human rights in Cuba.\n\nAlong with the prisoner exchange, Secretary of State John Kerry will take Cuba off the \u201cterror supporting nations\u201d list, and U.S. financial institutions will open links to their Cuban counterparts.\n\n\u201cIt is clear that decades of U.S. isolation of Cuba have failed to accomplish our enduring objective of promoting the emergence of a democratic, prosperous, and stable Cuba,\u201d White House spokesman Josh Earnest said in a written statement. \u201cThough this policy has been rooted in the best of intentions, it has had little effect \u2013 today, as in 1961, Cuba is governed by the Castros and the Communist party.\n\nThe Obama administration plans to convert the existing U.S. mission in Havana to the official status of an embassy as soon as possible.\n\nAs an initial step, the assistant secretary of state for Western Hemisphere Affairs will lead the U.S. delegation to the next round of U.S.-Cuba migration talks in January in Havana.\n\nWhile tourism will not be immediately permitted, the U.S. government intends to make available \u201cgeneral travel licenses\u201d for all authorized travelers in the following existing categories: 1) family visits; 2) official business of the U.S. government, foreign governments, and certain intergovernmental organizations; 3) journalistic activity; 4) professional research and professional meetings; 5) educational activities; 6) religious activities; 7) public performances, clinics, workshops, athletic and other competitions, and exhibitions; 8) support for the Cuban people; 9) humanitarian projects; 10) activities of private foundations or research or educational institutes; 11) exportation, importation, or transmission of information or information materials; and 12) certain export transactions that may be considered for authorization under existing regulations and guidelines.\n\nRemittance levels will be raised from $500 to $2,000 per quarter from the U.S. to Cuban nationals.\n\nLicensed U.S. travelers to Cuba will be authorized to import $400 worth of goods from Cuba, of which no more than $100 can consist of tobacco products and alcohol combined.\n\nU.S. institutions will be permitted to open correspondent accounts at Cuban financial institutions to facilitate the processing of authorized transactions.\n\nU.S. telecommunications providers will be allowed to establish the necessary mechanisms, including infrastructure, in Cuba to provide commercial telecommunications and Internet services.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "NEW YORK\u00a0\u2013 Having helped broker the agreement to normalize relations between the United States and communist Cuba, Pope Francis plans next to turn his attention to closing the U.S. prison at Guantanamo Bay, a goal he shares with President Obama.
