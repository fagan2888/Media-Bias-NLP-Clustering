John Kasich\u2019s habit of telling voters \u201cOhio money\u201d pays for his Obamacare Medicaid expansion is about to catch up to him.\n\nTo silence conservative critics, Kasich says Obamacare expansion is bringing $14 billion of Ohio money back to Ohio from the federal government.\n\nBut that\u2019s not how the expansion works \u2014 a fact Kasich\u2019s opponents in a crowded Republican presidential primary are certain to point out.\n\nThere is no vault of \u201cOhio money\u201d set aside to pay for Kasich\u2019s Obamacare expansion, which has already increased federal welfare spending by $4 billion.\n\nMatt Mayer, president of free-market think tank Opportunity Ohio, expects the governor\u2019s message to fall apart when it\u2019s challenged by other presidential candidates.\n\nIn an email to Ohio Watchdog, Mayer said Kasich\u2019s presidential platform relies on a misrepresentation of how Obamacare expansion is paid for.\n\n\u201cKasich\u2019s balanced state budget and false claim of \u2018getting Ohio money back\u2019 to extend Medicaid depend entirely on robbing the taxpayer Peters of tomorrow with federal deficit spending to pay the Obamacare Pauls of today,\u201d Mayer said.\n\n\u201cWithout the federal funny money that increases America\u2019s national debt, John Kasich\u2019s \u2018Ohio miracle\u2019 utterly collapses,\u201d Mayer added.\n\nDefending Obamacare expansion as a way to reclaim Ohio money from the feds has worked for Kasich so far, as his poll numbers have jumped following his official July 21 campaign announcement.\n\nThat\u2019s likely to change in the near future, since Kasich is competing for attention with Obamacare expansion foes that include former Florida governor Jeb Bush and former Texas governor Rick Perry.\n\nRELATED: Ohio Gov. John Kasich is Hillary\u2019s primary threat\n\nWhere did Kasich get the idea his Obamacare expansion would be paid for with Ohio money and not new federal spending? He made it up.\n\nIn 2013, the Kasich administration told state legislators Medicaid expansion was necessary to \u201ckeep $2.4 billion in Ohioans\u2019 federal tax dollars in Ohio ($13 billion over seven years).\u201d\n\nHealth policy experts from inside and outside Ohio explained to lawmakers this was inaccurate. Even Obamacare expansion supporters conceded Kasich was wrong.\n\nThe governor\u2019s office has never responded to requests for clarification from Ohio Watchdog; skeptics have since been vindicated by the Congressional Budget Office and Congressional Research Service.\n\nAnd yet, Kasich has revised his $13 billion estimate to $14 billion and keeps repeating his debunked \u201cOhio money back to Ohio\u201d claim.\n\n\u201cLook, you know, Ronald Reagan expanded Medicaid, I don\u2019t know, three or four times, Wolf, and we\u2019re bringing $14 billion over 7 years back to Ohio,\u201d Kasich told CNN host Wolf Blitzer on July 28.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t support Obamacare \u2014 I wanna repeal it \u2014 but I did expand Medicaid because I was able to bring Ohio money back home,\u201d Kasich told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper during a May interview.\n\nWhen Tapper noted Medicaid expansion is part of Obamacare, Kasich only dug in deeper, suggesting Medicaid expansion was somehow dreamed up by Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts.\n\n\u201cExpanding Medicaid is a separate issue, and John Roberts gave all the states the ability to decide that, and I\u2019m gonna bring 14 billion of Ohio money back to Ohio so we can deal with some of our vexing problems,\u201d Kasich added.\n\nMedicaid expansion \u201cbrought our money back to Ohio, 14 billion,\u201d Kasich told Sean Hannity during a July 21 Fox News interview.\n\nRegardless of his standing in the polls, Kasich\u2019s embrace of Obamacare may be seriously challenged in front of a national audience for the first time Thursday.\n\nFox News will host a prime-time debate for the top 10 Republican candidates Thursday evening, preceded by a forum for candidates who aren\u2019t polling in the top 10.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ohio Gov.
