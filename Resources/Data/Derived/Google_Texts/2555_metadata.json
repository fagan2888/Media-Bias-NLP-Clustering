Anthony List, Politics News\n\nThe New Yorker has a lengthy profile this week of Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the Susan B. Anthony List, a lobbying group that supports antiabortion candidates. The piece, written by Kelefa Sanneh, explores the group\u2019s messaging strategy around the upcoming elections and the delicate line it walks to create moderate talking points in support of an extreme platform. Basically, this boils down to focusing on the apparent perils of the Affordable Care Act and \u201ctaxpayer-funded abortion\u201d while advancing fringe policies that give clusters of tissue full legal rights.\n\nBut the group is reluctant to wear its support for fetal personhood heading into the midterms. Dannenfelser believes that life begins at conception and her view is consistent with the SBA List agenda, but the group doesn\u2019t really touch the issue during elections. Because it alienates voters, who generally balk when a politician starts talking about a total ban on abortion, a possible ban on certain forms of contraception and a policy that elevates the \u201crights\u201d of blastocysts over those of actual women. So instead, Dannenfelser focuses on policies that she views as having more mainstream traction, like the new healthcare law, which she does not like in the least.\n\nWhich is a little perplexing. Dannenfelser is a \u201cculture of life\u201d antiabortion activist. She boasts a degree of ideological consistency \u2014 by, say, opposing the death penalty \u2014 that many of the politicians she supports can\u2019t claim for themselves. But Dannenfelser\u2019s support for \u201clife\u201d has its limits, specifically when it comes to the law that gave more than 7 million people in this country healthcare. The Affordable Care Act, in the most literal terms imaginable, is a lifesaving piece of legislation. But Dannenfelser cried when a former political ally agreed to sign on to the law, a move that helped it pass. \u201cIt was one of the worst days I can remember,\u201d she said, recalling when Bart Stupak (of the Stupak-Pitts Amendment) agreed to support the ACA if it excluded abortion coverage.", "article_metadata": {"description": "SBA List president Marjorie Dannenfelser supports a \"culture of life.\" Unless you're poor and uninsured, that is", "title": "Meet the \u201cpro-life\u201d activist who cried (in a sad way!) when millions of people got health insurance", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "SBA List president Marjorie Dannenfelser supports a \"culture of life.\" Unless you're poor and uninsured, that is", "title": "Meet the \u201cpro-life\u201d activist who cried (in a sad way!) when millions of people got health insurance", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/10/22/meet_the_pro_life_activist_who_cried_in_a_sad_way_when_millions_of_people_got_health_insurance/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/10/marjorie_dannenfelser.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "SBA List president Marjorie Dannenfelser supports a \"culture of life.\" Unless you're poor and uninsured, that is", "title": "Meet the \u201cpro-life\u201d activist who cried (in a sad way!) when millions of people got health insurance", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/10/marjorie_dannenfelser.jpg", "creator": "@kmcdonovgh", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Katie McDonough", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Abortion, abortion rights, Affordable Care Act, anti-choice, antiabortion, health insurance, Poverty, pro-life, Susan B.
