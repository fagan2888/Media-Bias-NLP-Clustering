Kansas tied for 28th in the overall rankings and Missouri ranked 36th.\n\nBoth states got middling scores when it came to residents without health insurance, mainly because neither state has opted to expand Medicaid.\n\nNot surprisingly, Massachusetts, whose 2006 health care reform law was the model for Obamacare, had the fewest number of uninsured.\n\nIf Kansas performed like Massachusetts, the Commonwealth Fund estimates 171,000 more adults would be covered and receive health care when needed. If Missouri performed at Massachusetts\u2019 level, the fund estimates 386,000 more adults would be covered.\n\nYou can see the country's overall rankings below:\n\nCredit: Commonwealth Fund", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health", "description": "New health rankings from the Commonwealth Fund rank Kansas and Missouri in the bottom half of the 50 states and the District of Columbia, but both states", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://kmuw.org/post/kansas-missouri-improve-health-measures-still-bottom-half-ranking", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/kmuw/files/styles/medium/public/201512/commonwealth_fund_health_rankings.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "New health rankings from the Commonwealth Fund rank Kansas and Missouri in the bottom half of the 50 states and the District of Columbia, but both states", "title": "Kansas, Missouri Improve On Health Measures, But Still In Bottom Half Of Ranking"}, "story_id": 459601582, "twitter": {"site": "@kmuw", "card": "summary", "creator": "@kmuw"}, "author": "Dan Margolies", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Kansas, Missouri Improve On Health Measures, But Still In Bottom Half Of Ranking"}, "nid": 60749, "datePublished": "2015-12-13", "keywords": "Heartland Health Monitor, Medicaid expansion", "wordCount": 232, "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "New health rankings from the Commonwealth Fund rank Kansas and Missouri in the bottom half of the 50 states and the District of Columbia, but both states showed improvements.\nIf Kansas performed like Massachusetts, the Commonwealth Fund estimates 171,000 more adults would be covered and receive health care when needed.\nKansas tied for 28th in the overall rankings and Missouri ranked 36th.\nYou can see the country's overall rankings below:Credit: Commonwealth Fund\nIf Missouri performed at Massachusetts\u2019 level, the fund estimates 386,000 more adults would be covered."}
