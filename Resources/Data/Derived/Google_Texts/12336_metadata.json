Dionne, Pelosi offered the audience interesting quotes and takes from her perch as the top Democrat in the U.S. House.\n\nHere are 10 that caught our attention.\n\n1) Pelosi\u2019s view of the Affordable Care Act: \u201cEven if there were no other reason to pass [Obamacare], even if everyone was happy with his or her health care insurance or care, we still would have had to pass the bill, because the cost of health care in America was unsustainable.\u201d\n\n2) On energy policy: \u201cIn terms of American innovation, we substantially bolstered our investments, fueling basic research, and driving forward innovative energy technologies. \u2026 Knowing that our reliance on foreign fossil fuels is unhealthy for our economy, our national security, and the air our children breathe, Democrats acted to make America energy independent.\u201d\n\n3) \u201cLaissez, laissez, laissez-faire,\u201d Pelosi said, as she implied that it was that and other \u201cradical trickle-down\u201d policies that led to the 2008 financial crisis.\n\n4) On Democrats\u2019 efforts on TARP in the midst of the 2008 crisis: \u201cThe first of Democratic efforts are apparent. We provided a lifeline to save the auto industry and a million jobs.\u201d\n\n5) \u201cIt was a messaging problem,\u201d Pelosi said of the Obama\u2019s economic stimulus, the auto industry bailout and Obamacare.\n\n6) \u201cNo one begrudges your success,\u201d Pelosi said, hitting back at Rep. Paul Ryan\u2019s \u201cenvy economics\u201d comment, claiming that Democrats don\u2019t believe in class warfare.\n\n7) \u201cWhen we moved to something called shareholder capitalism, it went to 300 times,\u201d Pelosi said about employee-to-CEO pay. \u201cWe just don\u2019t want a rising tide lifting all yachts, we want it to lift all boats.\u201d\n\n8) On Republicans and the role of government: \u201cThe debate of government\u2019s role has been the debate since the beginning. The Republicans don\u2019t support governance. They don\u2019t believe in science, and they don\u2019t believe in Obama.\u201d\n\n9) Abortion had \u201cnothing to do\u201d with Obamacare.\n\n10) On the current debate over vaccines: \u201cI\u2019m sympathetic to the concerns and I\u2019ve met and spent many hours and tried to facilitate with families who have had concerns about vaccines be it autism or otherwise. It is a public health issue, and the fact is, is that children should be vaccinated.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi engaged in an hour-long defense of the President's budget and liberal priorities at the Brookings Institution yesterday.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi engaged in an hour-long defense of the President's budget and liberal priorities at the Brookings Institution yesterday.", "title": "Nancy Pelosi\u2019s Policy Agenda, Summed Up in These 10 Quotes", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/rollcallpix087584.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-02-05T13:54:14+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1zJlKmS"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi engaged in an hour-long defense of the President's budget and liberal priorities at the Brookings Institution yesterday.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/rollcallpix087584.jpg"}, "title": "Nancy Pelosi\u2019s Policy Agenda, Summed Up in These 10 Quotes", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "politics", "published_time": "2015-02-04T17:31:51+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-05T13:54:14+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "budget, economy, Nancy Pelosi, Barack Obama, Paul Ryan,"}, "article_summary": "They don\u2019t believe in science, and they don\u2019t believe in Obama.\u201d9) Abortion had \u201cnothing to do\u201d with Obamacare.\n6) \u201cNo one begrudges your success,\u201d Pelosi said, hitting back at Rep.
