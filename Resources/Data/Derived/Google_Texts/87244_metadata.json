Christopher Stevens.\n\nThe bipartisan report lays out more than a dozen findings regarding the assaults on Sept. 11 and 12, 2012, on a diplomatic compound and a CIA annex in the Libyan city of Benghazi. It says the State Department failed to increase security at its diplomatic mission despite warnings and faults intelligence agencies for not sharing information about the existence of the CIA outpost with the U.S. military.\n\nRelated: If Benghazi Was a Coverup, How High Did It Go?\n\nThe committee determined that the U.S. military command in Africa didn\u2019t know about the CIA annex and that the Pentagon didn\u2019t have the resources in place to defend the diplomatic compound in an emergency.\n\n\u201cThe attacks were preventable, based on extensive intelligence reporting on the terrorist activity in Libya \u2014 to include prior threats and attacks against Western targets \u2014 and given the known security shortfalls at the U.S. Mission,\u201d the panel said in a statement.\n\nThe report also notes, chillingly, that the FBI\u2019s investigation into the attacks has been hampered inside Libya, and that 15 people \u201csupporting the investigation or otherwise helpful to the United States\u201d have since been killed in Benghazi. The report says it is unclear whether those killings were related to the investigation.\n\n[Read the report.]\n\nMuch of the report released Wednesday recounts now-familiar facts about deteriorating security conditions in Benghazi in 2012, a year after the fall of longtime dictator Moammar Gaddafi. It fills in new details about the relationship between the State Department compound and the CIA annex about a mile away, and describes the rising concern among many intelligence specialists about the growing potency of Islamist militants in the city.\n\nRelated: GOP Lawmaker Disputes NY Times Report on Benghazi\n\n\u201cIn spite of the deteriorating security situation in Benghazi and ample strategic warnings, the United States Government simply did not do enough to prevent these attacks and ensure the safety of those serving in Benghazi,\u201d said Sen. Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.), vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee.\n\nIn response to the report\u2019s release, the State Department issued an update of its efforts to improve security at overseas posts and make other changes recommended by an independent oversight panel \u2014 the Accountability Review Board \u2014 shortly after the attacks.\n\n\u201cWhile risk can never be completely eliminated from our diplomatic and development duties,\u201d the State Department statement said, \u201cwe must always work to minimize it.\u201d\n\nThe agency said it is refining procedures for assessing risk and evaluating security measures in highly volatile areas, including when to depart from the usual reliance on local hired security guards. \u201cHard decisions must be made when it comes to whether the United States should operate in dangerous overseas locations,\u201d the statement said.\n\nRelated: Benghazi Emails Show Officials Lied About Terror Attack\n\nState Department deputy spokeswoman Marie Harf said the Senate report adds little new information and does not do much to expand to the government\u2019s understanding of the attacks. \u201cWe should have been better then, and we need to get better going forward,\u201d Harf said.\n\nThe report is based on dozens of committee hearings, briefings and interviews \u2014 including with survivors of the attacks \u2014 and on thousands of pages of intelligence and State Department materials collected between September 2012 and December 2013. The account sheds little light on the most politicized aspect of the incident \u2014 questions about whether the Obama administration deliberately played down the terrorist origins of the attacks. The committee described the attacks as opportunistic and said there was no specific advance warning that they were about to be carried out.\n\nThe report says that on Sept. 18, 2012, the \u201cFBI and CIA reviewed the closed circuit television video from the Mission facility that showed there were no protests prior to the attacks.\u201d\n\nRelated: Scandals Threaten to Derail Obama's Agenda\n\nBut it took six more days for intelligence officials to revise their chronology of events and say that \u201cthere were no demonstrations or protests\u201d at the diplomatic compound \u201cprior to the attacks.\u201d\n\nThe report says it was problematic that the CIA and State Department were not working out of the same facility together in the dangerous Benghazi environment. That meant the CIA and its well-trained contractors, who had served in elite U.S. forces, were not on location at the diplomatic outpost in the event of a crisis.\n\nSix armed CIA employees and a linguist responded to the attack on the diplomatic compound late on Sept. 11, 2012, the report says. About 30 minutes passed before the CIA team arrived on the scene and \u201cexchanged fire with the attackers.\u201d They neither asked permission to come to the aid of the diplomats nor were told to stand down.\n\nDetailed accounts provided to the committee describe a harrowing attack and U.S. personnel scrambling to survive the assault. Attackers used \u201cdiesel fuel to set the main building ablaze, and thick smoke rapidly filled the entire structure,\u201d the report says. According to testimony by the director of the National Counterterrorism Center, a diplomatic security agent led Stevens, the ambassador, to an escape window at the diplomatic compound.\n\n\u201cNearing unconsciousness himself, the agent opened the emergency escape window and crawled out. He then realized he had become separated from the Ambassador . . . so he reentered and searched the building multiple times,\u201d the report says. \u201cThe DS agent, suffering from severe smoke inhalation, climbed a ladder to the roof where he radioed the other DS agents for assistance and attempted unsuccessfully to ventilate the building by breaking a skylight.\u201d\n\nThe committee found that the military response to the attacks was slow and hindered, but not purposely so. \u201cAt approximately 1:15 a.m. Benghazi time [on Sept. 12], a seven-man reinforcement team of additional U.S. security personnel from Tripoli landed at the Benghazi airport and began to negotiate with the local Libyan militias for transportation and a security convoy,\u201d the report says. The team would not leave the airport for the annex until more than three hours later.\n\nA separate attack on the CIA annex at about 5:15 a.m. on Sept. 12 resulted in the deaths of two security officers, who were killed by mortar fire \u201cas they engaged the enemy from the roof of the Annex,\u201d the report says.\n\nIn the weeks leading up to the attacks, the CIA knew that conditions on the ground were worsening. In August, the agency alerted the intelligence community that there were Islamist training camps and militias in Benghazi. The agency said it was concerned about local militias providing security at U.S. facilities and about the outpost\u2019s lack of defense. That same month, there were 20 security incidents in Benghazi.\n\nThe report said that the Libyan militia charged with protecting the diplomatic compound didn\u2019t defend it during the attack.\n\nThe committee\u2019s minority criticized the White House for obstructing the report, which the committee had wanted to complete much earlier, and accused Patrick Kennedy, U.S. undersecretary of state for management, of shielding the Obama administration from Congressional oversight.\n\nSen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) said Kennedy \u201cfailed to ensure that a facility he personally approved in December 2011 had the necessary security to match the heightened threat environment.\u201d\n\nSo far, the FBI has charged 13 people in connection with the attacks in sealed criminal complaints. More charges are expected. Members of the terrorist group Ansar al-Sharia, based in the Libyan city of Darnah, have been implicated.\n\nA former Guantanamo Bay detainee named Abu Sufian bin Qumu runs Ansar al-Sharia. Qumu is mentioned in one of the report\u2019s footnotes, but the context was redacted in the version that was publicly released. The report says that \u201ckey information gaps remain about the potential foreknowledge and complicity of Libyan militia groups and security forces, the level of pre-planning for the attacks, the perpetrators and their involvement in other terrorist activities and the motivation for the attacks.\u201d\n\nThis article originally appeared in The Washington Post.\n\nRead more at The Washington Post:\n\n40 Maps That Explain the World\n\nRep.
