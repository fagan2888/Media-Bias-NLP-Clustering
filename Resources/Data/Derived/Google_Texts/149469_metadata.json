The time frame is very short; they are trying to jam this through the process. If we don\u2019t make our voices heard, they are going to get away with it,\u201d he said.\n\nHis group set up a procedure at the IRSTarget.com site that allows constituents to submit comments, either above their signature or anonymously.\n\nThe targeting of conservative groups by the IRS with harassment that included invasive probes into the content of prayers and unwarranted delays is being addressed in court.\n\nBut Kibbe said rules changes were announced very quietly in November that would formalize the behavior that prompted outrage by the public.\n\nStaver told WND in an interview the proposed regulations pose a \u201cserious threat to freedom of speech.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis literally silences people of faith and those who have the right to be able to express themselves in the marketplace of political ideas,\u201d he said. \u201cThis proposed regulation not only will silence 501 (c) 4 [groups], which are designed so that they can engage in social and issue advocacy speech, it also silences people who are associated with [the groups].\u201d\n\nIRS definitions are supposed to allow 501 (c) 4 groups to engage in political speech that is not allowed for the charitable group designation under which many churches operate, 501 (c) 3.\n\nBut Staver said the new regulations restrict speech and impose \u201cblackout\u201d periods in which no statements are allowed at all on issues such as radical and leftist judicial nominees and policies.\n\n\u201cThis underscores, I think, the fact that when the IRS under the Obama administration was targeting organizations of a conservative [view], it wasn\u2019t by accident. They were intentionally trying to shut down political debate in the 2012 election.\u201d\n\nHe said the proposal proves the Obama administration still is trying to silence anyone who doesn\u2019t agree with the president\u2019s far-left political agenda.\n\nAmericans already hated the IRS, so how could anything damage its reputation? Read this special Whistleblower magazine issue to find out.\n\nIn a statement to supporters, Staver explained that the IRS, the \u201cmost feared of all federal agencies,\u201d wants a regulation that would restrict organizations like Liberty Counsel Action, which \u201ccall out\u201d politicians and their policies.\n\n\u201cWe would be restricted in promoting conservative values, such as protecting our constitutional rights against the executive branch\u2019s infringements,\u201d he said.\n\nHis group would even be prohibited from criticizing the federal bureaucracy, he said.\n\nThe rules would prohibit using words such as \u201coppose,\u201d \u201cvote,\u201d \u201csupport,\u201d \u201cdefeat\u201d and \u201creject,\u201d he said.\n\nThe IRS also wants a ban on voter registration drives or nonpartisan \u201cget-out-the-vote\u201d drives and on voter guides outlining how incumbents voted on particular bills, he said.\n\nThe rules also apply to officers or leaders when they speak about candidates or legislation. It would limit them in making any statements on those issues or the nomination of judges, he said.\n\n\u201cFurther, any member of the Liberty Counsel Action team will be banned from speaking or messaging on incumbents, legislation, and/or voting records \u2013 or to speak on the nominations of judges or political nominees being considered by the Senate. This also includes state and local politicians,\u201d Liberty Counsel explained. \u201cWhat\u2019s more, the new set of regulations exempts prominent liberal lobbying groups like labor unions!\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is just the beginning of \u2018selective enforcement,'\u201d Staver\u2019s action organization said. \u201cMost of the exempted organizations are liberal and in the back pocket of the Democrat party \u2013 and vice-versa. Most key players in the liberal \u2018progressive\u2019 bloc will not be silenced or restricted by these new regulations.\u201d\n\nThe organization said the new rules are \u201d clear evidence that President Obama intends to silence the voices of his political adversaries using elements of the federal government.\u201d\n\nWND reported on the IRS targeting of conservative and Christian organizations. The IRS apparently deliberately delayed their requests for tax-exempt status to curb their effectiveness in the 2012 election.\n\nOne IRS official pleaded the Fifth Amendment and declined to respond to questions from Congress. But others in the agency have admitted to cases cited by conservative groups. One group was told, for example, it had to reveal the content of members\u2019 prayers or make promises about what they would or would not say.\n\nThe discrimination, which started before the 2012 presidential election, limited the effectiveness of nearly 500 activist organizations as Barack Obama and his liberal agenda rolled to victory.\n\nNow lawsuits are pending that allege the Obama administration violated the First and Fifth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution and the Administrative Procedure Act in addition to various rules and regulations.\n\nA suit asks that the court issue a declaratory judgment that the IRS \u201cunlawfully delayed and obstructed the organizations\u2019 applications\u201d for tax status determinations. It alleges the actions were based on unconstitutional standards and \u201cimpermissibly disparate treatment.\u201d Further, the legal claim asks for an injunction to protect the groups and their officers and directors from further IRS abuse.\n\nAmong the claims is one by the American Center for Law and Justice, which filed its case against the government in May on behalf of dozens of conservative organizations that had their applications delayed or denied because of their beliefs.\n\nACLJ claims the evidence shows there was a \u201cpolitically motivated attack on conservative organizations by the IRS \u2013 a secret and illegal targeting campaign \u2013 aimed at the organizations because of their political beliefs.\u201d\n\nJay Sekulow, ACLJ chief counsel, said \u201cthe intimidation campaign conducted by the IRS is much more politically motivated and coordinated than previously thought.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit is believed to be the largest of its kind against the IRS, representing 41 different organizations that claim biased treatment.\n\n\u201cWe now know that President Obama through his public comments initiated actions that resulted in the unlawful targeting of our clients \u2013 a self-induced unconstitutional act,\u201d Sekulow said. \u201cIn addition to the president\u2019s remarks, congressional Democrats along with the media created a climate of hostility \u2013 making it impossible for our clients to exercise their First Amendment freedoms.\u201d\n\nAmericans already hated the IRS, so how could anything damage its reputation?
