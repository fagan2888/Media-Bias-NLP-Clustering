Public health professionals can access the information in more efficient and impactful ways that will help them better tailor resources and interventions to meet the needs of those in the areas hardest hit. Atlas users can also easily toggle between cases and rates; identify disparities by race/ethnicity, sex, and age; access pre-developed queries suggested by CDC\u2019s scientific staff; and access links for more information.\n\nWith the NCHHSTP Atlas, users can also:\n\nCreate maps, tables, and bar graphs\n\nExplore a variety of data stratifications\n\nDisplay data trends over time and across the United States\n\nDownload and export data and graphics\n\nQuery data for ad hoc customizable reports\n\nReceive detailed and complete information on surveillance data footnotes and caveats\n\nCDC\u2019s Atlas team is always working to improve this important tool. A dashboard and additional graphics as well as more data will be added in the future, including census socioeconomic data, and HIV and STD testing data.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "blog.aids.gov \u2014 HIV Policy & Programs.
