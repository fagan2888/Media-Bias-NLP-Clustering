The Pascua Yaqui Tribe received the Tribal Initiatives Award. The award was bestowed on the 17,000-member tribe for its success in completing two projects totaling 96 unites in less than three years. Known as Pascua Yaqui Homes II and IV add 40 new units along with over 70 rehabilitated units.\n\nTribal needs for housing in Arizona are especially high, where the average household size for the state is 2.66 persons, on the reservation the average is 5 persons. These 96 units will put a small dent in the more than 500 households currently on a waiting list for housing. Pascua Yaqui Homes II and IV offer a mix of three, four and five bedroom single-family homes to help address overcrowding issues.\n\n\u201cThe Pascua Yaqui Tribe has succeeded in providing their lowest income residents with safe and affordable homes while preserving the tribe\u2019s rich history and tradition. It can charge minimal rent to its impoverished residents and still utilize a very secure financing structure. The tribe\u2019s achievements serve as a source of hope and an example to other tribes,\u201d an Arizona Department of Housing release said announcing the awards.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Pascua Yaqui Tribe recently received the Tribal Initiatives Award by the Arizona Department of Housing for two completed housing projects.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/10/04/pascua-yaqui-tribe-honored-arizona-department-housing-157140", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "type": "article", "title": "Pascua Yaqui Tribe Honored by Arizona Department of Housing"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dc": {"title": "Pascua Yaqui Tribe Honored by Arizona Department of Housing"}, "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/10/04/pascua-yaqui-tribe-honored-arizona-department-housing-157140", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.creator": "kpolisse", "dcterms.date": "2014-10-04T12:00-04:00", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Pascua Yaqui Tribe, Arizona Department of Housing, Low-Income Housing, Arizona Housing Forum, 2014 Brian Mickelsen Housing Hero Awards, Tribal Housing", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.title": "Pascua Yaqui Tribe Honored by Arizona Department of Housing"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf18a\"", "article_summary": "The Arizona Housing Forum, now in its 11th year and presented by the Arizona Department of Housing, recently concluded with an awards presentation at the JW Marriott Starr Pass Resort in Tucson, Arizona, where the Pascua Yaqui Tribe were honored.\nThe Pascua Yaqui Tribe received the Tribal Initiatives Award.\nPascua Yaqui Homes II and IV offer a mix of three, four and five bedroom single-family homes to help address overcrowding issues.\nKnown as Pascua Yaqui Homes II and IV add 40 new units along with over 70 rehabilitated units.\n\u201cThe Pascua Yaqui Tribe has succeeded in providing their lowest income residents with safe and affordable homes while preserving the tribe\u2019s rich history and tradition."}
