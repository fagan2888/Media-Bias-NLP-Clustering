Why is that?\n\nOne of the biggest factors is cost, which still hinders many Americans from purchasing insurance. It may seem obvious, but the data shows many of the uninsured can\u2019t afford coverage, even after reforms were passed.\n\nThe vision of affordable health insurance for all Americans continues to be far from reality. The data journalists at HealthGrove examined numbers gathered from ACASignups.net to help shed some light on the matter.\n\nACASignups is curated by web developer Charles Gaba, who has collected health insurance data on Obamacare throughout the years. That data has been cited in numerous publications for his health-care-related investigation and analysis. Gaba supports the law, but his data have been used as talking points for media outlets on both sides of the political aisle.\n\nThe red bar above illustrates that about 10 percent of the country\u2019s population is still uninsured.\n\nEmployer-sponsored coverage is the most popular way people get insurance. Next are those covered by Medicare, the federal insurance program that primarily serves Americans over 65 years old.\n\nMedicare should not be confused with Medicaid, a program run by both federal and state governments that helps pay medical costs for people with limited incomes. People covered by this program make up the third-largest categorization.\n\nSo with about 87 percent getting covered by their employer, Medicare or Medicaid, and another four percent covered by the health care exchange or other means, who makes up the uninsured remainder?\n\nThis group is largely made up of three significant categories: people who haven\u2019t signed up for insurance whether they qualify for tax credits or not, people who qualify for Medicaid but haven\u2019t enrolled, as well as undocumented immigrants.\n\nGaba described people in the first category this way. \u201cSome don\u2019t know they\u2019re eligible for help,\u201d he told HealthGrove. He added that others should be eligible but aren\u2019t because of the \u201cfamily glitch\u201d\u2013 a loophole that occurs when families don\u2019t receive financial assistance to help pay for marketplace insurance.\n\n\u201cFor the rest, either the financial help is still not enough, or [insurance is] just too pricey without it,\u201d he said.\n\nFive million people are eligible for Medicaid, but not signed up. Another 13.5 million people are split between eligibility and ineligibility for tax credits.\n\nAbout 4.7 million people in the uninsured group are in the U.S. illegally and do not qualify for Medicaid or for subsidies to help them purchase their own insurance. A bill has been put forward in California, seeking federal permission to allow undocumented immigrants to purchase insurance through a state exchange.\n\nAbout 3 million of the uninsured are children who qualify for the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program \u2013 identified as CHIP in the visualization \u2013 but are not enrolled.\n\nThere\u2019s a fourth group noted \u2013 representing 2.8 million uninsured Americans \u2013 that falls into the \u201cMedicaid Gap.\u201d\n\nWith their 2012 ruling, the U.S. Supreme Court made Medicaid expansion optional to states. To date, 31 states have chosen to expand, covering more low-income residents than previously would have qualified. But many states have not expanded coverage \u2014 including those with large numbers of uninsured citizens, like Texas and Florida.\n\nMost of the South hasn\u2019t expanded Medicaid, as a large swath of red on the map below shows.\n\nTwo states \u2013 Louisiana and Arkansas \u2013 stand out as notable exceptions in the Southern portion of the map.\n\nThat\u2019s because Louisiana\u2019s Gov. John Bel Edwards signed an executive order that would expand Medicaid in that state, the 31st to expand the program. The law would allow more than 300,000 people to have insurance, and state officials have said the move will save Louisiana $1 billion over the next decade.\n\nAt the end of April, Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson vetoed a provision that would have ended Medicaid expansion for more than a quarter-million low-income residents at the end of the year.\n\nPolitical will isn\u2019t the only barrier for the uninsured.\n\nMost people who lack health insurance say that costs are the main reason they don\u2019t have it, according to a report commissioned by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.\n\nThe visualization below shows the states that have seen premium changes for plans on the Obamacare marketplace, detailing prices for the silver plan, which is used as the benchmark when calculating subsidies.\n\nLooking back, there\u2019s no doubt the passage of the health care law expanded coverage for millions of Americans. The large influx of people getting coverage for the first time may be leveling off, however, with smaller declines seen in recent years.\n\nWithout significant steps to increase enrollment or control costs, the remaining uninsured may stay that way until more changes take place.", "article_metadata": {"description": "An estimated 20 million people have gained insurance since health care reform was signed into law in 2010, but in the six years since, a significant group of Americans remain uninsured.
