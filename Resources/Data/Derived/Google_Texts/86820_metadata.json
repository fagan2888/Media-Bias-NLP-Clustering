She is conducting her fieldwork at Dzanga Bai, an idyllic clearing in the Dzanga-Ndoki National Park in the Central African Republic (CAR) where elephants come to drink the mineral-rich waters and wallow in the mud.\n\nUnlike their cousins on the open savannah, forest elephants are typically hidden by thick jungle and difficult to track. Scientists often locate the reclusive animals by monitoring their vocalizations, some of which can be detected from miles away.\n\nDespite being one of the best protected sites in the region, heavily armed poachers entered Dzanga Bai last May, butchering 26 elephants, mostly mothers and their calves. They fired their automatic weapons from the observation platforms used by researchers themselves, leaving behind a horrific crime scene. The grassy glade, usually teeming with elephant family groups emotionally reuniting after weeks of wandering in small bands through the forest, was littered with piles of elephant parts, bones and blood-soaked scraps of skin.\n\nTragically, such scenes are becoming commonplace throughout Central Africa. An astonishing 60 percent of the region\u2019s forest elephants have been lost in the first decade of the 21st century, and they have disappeared entirely from over half of their range in just the past 30 years. The forest elephant is regarded by biologists as a separate species from the more numerous and larger bush elephants of the African plains, but it is under the same unrelenting pressure from poachers, who are slaughtering them in order to hack off their tusks.\n\nElephant ivory is fashioned into intricately carved statues, jewelry and religious icons, which are in demand worldwide, but especially prized in East Asia and the Philippines\u2014a $7 billion to $10 billion a year business. Most ivory is processed in China, but a lot of the carving is now being done in Africa itself, particularly in Kinshasa in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The prime subject for African carvers, ironically enough, is elephants. Ivory elephants may already outnumber the living creatures, which are being killed at the unsustainable rate of 35,000 per year. Fully eight out of 10 elephants now die as a result of poaching rather than from natural causes.\n\nThe frenzy to obtain ivory is accelerating, as many Asian economies boom and prices for the increasingly rare luxury items soar. Andrea Turkalo knows all about this frenzy. Last March, she managed to escape from advancing S\u00e9l\u00e9ka guerilla fighters who were descending on the nation\u2019s capital Bangui to stage the coup that ousted former CAR President Fran\u00e7ois Boziz\u00e9. Turkalo is now back in the states waiting for things to settle down before returning to Africa. Groups like the S\u00e9l\u00e9ka train their guns on innocent civilians as well as the wild elephants in their path.\n\nThe attack at the Westgate Mall in Nairobi in September, in which 68 people perished, was carried out by the Somali terror group Al-Shabaab, which routinely sends teams over the Somali border into Kenya to poach elephants. An undercover investigation by the Elephant Action League (EAL) found that 40% of Al-Shabaab\u2019s income\u2014as much as half a million dollars a month\u2014comes from trafficking in illicit ivory, and the even rarer rhino horn.\n\n\u201cAs the West continues to fight radical terrorist organizations through seizing assets in offshore bank accounts, straw companies and \u201ccharities\u201d,\u201d the EAL reports, \u201cthese organizations, including Al Shabaab, will rely increasingly on trafficking in contraband as a source of finance.\u201d\n\nA couple of dozen elephant tusks are all it took to fund the deadly attack on the mall, or to pay the yearly salaries for roughly 600 Al Shabaab fighters who are now wreaking havoc in the Horn of Africa. Darfur\u2019s Janjaweed and Joseph Kony\u2019s Lord\u2019s Resistance Army are just a two of the other violent groups that have bankrolled their activities with the white gold of elephant ivory. The same thing is happening in the Central Africa Republic, where the S\u00e9l\u00e9ka, a coalition of rebel bands from the desert nation Chad and elsewhere which are now sowing chaos in the troubled region, have been poaching elephants to finance their attacks.\n\nFew places are safe from poaching. The once remote region where Andrea Turkalo does her fieldwork has been opened in the past decades to logging, which has brought armed gangs of poachers in its wake.\n\n\u201cEverything has changed,\u201d Turkalo says. \u201cBefore you\u2019d have people in the area poaching elephants for local officials or corrupt game wardens. Nowadays, the poaching is often run by international syndicates, or by outsiders, refugees who have emigrated into our area from Muslim savannah to the north. It is very well organized.\u201d\n\nPoaching is an increasingly high-tech activity often employing helicopters, night vision goggles, an array of high-powered weapons, satellite phones, and critically, information gleaned on the Internet. Poachers can now track some elephant movements from satellite images and other freely available information including, ironically, the research of scientists like Turkalo. When the Elephant Listening Project put a photo of one old elephant with beautiful two-meter long tusks on their website, they got a flurry of hits, largely from the Far East and China, most likely from individuals who were \u201cscouting to find out where these animals still exist\u201d Turkalo guesses.\n\nThe Chinese are the largest foreign investors in much of Central Africa. Chinese workers may themselves be supervising some of the poaching operations, and smuggling the ivory back home. \u201cWherever Chinese loggers and road builders go,\u201d Turkalo observes, \u201cwe see a fall-off in the number of elephants.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The brutal but lucrative ivory trade, fueled largely by U.S. demand, is wiping out elephants and funding terrorists", "title": "African forest elephants are being massacred into extinction", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The brutal but lucrative ivory trade, fueled largely by U.S. demand, is wiping out elephants and funding terrorists", "title": "African forest elephants are being massacred into extinction", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/01/05/african_forest_elephants_are_being_massacred_into_extinction_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/elephant.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The brutal but lucrative ivory trade, fueled largely by U.S. demand, is wiping out elephants and funding terrorists", "title": "African forest elephants are being massacred into extinction", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/elephant.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Richard Schiffman", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, AlterNet, black market, elephants, extinction, Ivory, Noble Beasts, Poaching", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2b3f\"", "article_summary": "Unlike their cousins on the open savannah, forest elephants are typically hidden by thick jungle and difficult to track.\nIvory elephants may already outnumber the living creatures, which are being killed at the unsustainable rate of 35,000 per year.\n\u201cBefore you\u2019d have people in the area poaching elephants for local officials or corrupt game wardens.\nAn astonishing 60 percent of the region\u2019s forest elephants have been lost in the first decade of the 21st century, and they have disappeared entirely from over half of their range in just the past 30 years.\nThe Chinese are the largest foreign investors in much of Central Africa."}
