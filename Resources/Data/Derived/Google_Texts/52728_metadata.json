The effort includes targeted outreach to the most vulnerable populations.\n\nFor homeless adults, Medicaid coverage will make a huge difference to their health and quality of life, says Daniel Malone, director of housing programs at the Downtown Emergency Service Center (DESC) in Seattle, which provides shelter, housing and other support services.\n\nMedicaid coverage will mean \u201cpeace of mind and being able to establish regular health care so they can get it when they need it and not have to wait for an emergency,\u201d Malone said.\n\nTwenty-five DESC staff members recently completed a one-day training seminar to become certified as \u201cin-person assisters\u201d who can help people enroll in healthcare coverage, including Medicaid, through the state\u2019s new health-insurance exchange.\n\nOne of those clients is Charles Hill, 28, who has been uninsured for the past three years. Hill hopes Medicaid coverage will improve his access to dental care. He had two teeth removed and is worried he will lose more to tooth decay because he cannot afford fillings or preventive care.\n\nTom Wallis, 52, is also a DESC client and has been uninsured for the past 14 years. Wallis is living with chronic back pain and cataracts in both eyes. He has had sporadic health care. But without insurance, he said, \u201cit\u2019s been a real rough ride.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"t_omni_path": "st|health|healthcarecheckup|article", "description": "People who work directly with homeless adults in King County are gearing up to enroll as many of their clients as possible in the state\u2019s expanded Medicaid program, which is one of the central components of the federal Affordable Care Act.
