Mike Pitts, R-Laurens, told the Index-Journal in Greenwood, S.C.\n\nHe said of his bill: \u201cBasically, it is the [concealed weapons permit] law with journalists and pens instead of guns.\u201d\n\nPitts said he introduced the bill, called the South Carolina Responsible Journalism Registry, as an \u201cexperiment to make a point about the media and how they only care about the Constitution when it comes [to] their portion of the First Amendment.\u201d\n\nIn a Facebook post Wednesday, the Republican lawmaker said the news media makes much of the First Amendment right to a free press but easily can \u201ctrample on our Second Amendment rights to \u2018keep and bear arms.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cIf they had their way, there would be no Second Amendment,\u201d Pitts wrote.\n\nHis bill\u2014which has been referred to the Committee on Labor, Commerce, and Industry\u2014would require media outlets and journalists to pay fees and register with the South Carolina Secretary of State\u2019s Office. It would create requirements to work as a journalist for a media outlet and also for a media outlet before it hires a journalist.\n\n\u201cThis is a dangerous, ridiculous law, and a fundamental violation of the First Amendment,\u201d Hans von Spakovsky, a senior legal fellow in the Edwin Meese III Center for Legal and Judicial Studies at The Heritage Foundation, said.\n\nUnder the bill, journalists could be fined $25 to $500 for not registering and could be jailed for up to 30 days, the Post and Courier in Charleston reported. The paper notes that Pitts compares these penalties to those received for concealed weapons permit violations.\n\nVon Spakovsky said the measure \u201cis similar to British licensing laws for newspapers, which were efforts by the British crown to control and censor them.\u201d He added:\n\nI can\u2019t think of anything worse than putting a state government in charge of determining who is a \u201cqualified\u201d journalist. This legislator needs a basic education in the history and meaning of the First Amendment.\n\nPolitical observers give the bill little chance of advancing, the Post and Courier reported.\n\nHe is \u201cnot a press hater,\u201d Pitts, 60, told the Post and Courier.\n\n\u201cMy real issue is simply to start to debate about all of your constitutional rights. And that they are all equally important, and they are all separate,\u201d he said in an interview with the Index-Journal.\n\nPitts wrote on Facebook:", "article_metadata": {"description": "Reporters, he says, care more about their First Amendment rights than others' Second Amendment rights.
