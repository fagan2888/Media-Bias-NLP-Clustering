Tim Scott, left.\n\nCHARLESTON, S.C.\n\nSo if an Indian American, an African American, and a Cuban American all walk into a high-school gym together, what do you have?\n\n\u201cThe new look of the conservative movement,\u201d declared South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, who along with US Senator Tim Scott, have been barnstorming across the Palmetto State on behalf of fellow Republican Macro Rubio in the final days of the Republican presidential primary.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s not the kind of leadership tableau you\u2019d have expected just a few years ago from the Republican Party, certainly not in a conservative southern state like South Carolina. And the neo-GOP trio is not just racially or ethnically different. With Rubio and Haley both 44, and Scott 50, they all hail from Generation X.\n\nCertainly the large crowd at RB Stall High School in Charleston reacted enthusiastically to them.\n\nSome voters, like Ed Bennett, retired Army, from Charleston, said he\u2019d never thought of them in racial or ethnic terms, but just liked them because of what they stood for and the way they conduct themselves.\n\nOthers were inspired by the idea that, as a first generation American, Rubio was a serious presidential prospect.\n\n\u201cHe is the epitome of the American dream,\u201d gushed Dan Laudone, a home inspector who lives in Pawley\u2019s Island, a coastal community near Myrtle Beach, as he waited for a Rubio rally eventually canceled because of airplane problems.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the closest thing I\u2019ve seen to Ronald Reagan,\u201d declared Karen Beal of Georgetown, whose parents were instrumental in jump-starting the Republican Party in the area.\n\nTracy Kurtz, a forty-something mom at Rubio\u2019s Charleston rally, said Republicans like Rubio, Haley, and Scott are essential to the party\u2019s survival.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what we need,\u201d she said. People \u201care pretty na\u00efve if they think it is going to work any other way.\u201d\n\nBut will it work this way?\n\nThe three political pals plus Caucasian Congressman Trey Gowdy, who is also backing Rubio, \u201clooked like a [United Colors of] Benetton ad,\u201d Haley joked.\n\nThe question: Is it an ad that could sell the GOP\u2019s aging political product to a new universe of voters?\n\nThat\u2019s part of Rubio\u2019s conservative appeal. He told the crowd that he would \u201ctake our principles to people who do not vote for us,\u201d to those who grew up poor, \u201cto the people who live paycheck to paycheck.\u201d\n\nThe crowd of 1,000 or so loved that line \u2014 but you couldn\u2019t help but notice that that same crowd had only a smattering of non-white faces.\n\nNow, let\u2019s set aside front-runner Donald Trump for a minute. Certainly if Rubio won the nomination and tapped Haley for his ticket, that would give the GOP bragging rights when it comes to youth, diversity, and charisma.\n\nBut would that repair the ill will the GOP has created with Latino voters during a campaign filled with harsh rhetoric about illegal immigrants?\n\nThat\u2019s a particularly pertinent question given that Rubio has not only abandoned his previous support for comprehensive immigration reform, but, under pressure from Ted Cruz, has now declared that he would end the Obama-administration\u2019s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program on day one. That would mean no more deportation protection for the so-called dreamers.\n\nOn to health care: Even framed as a restoration of liberty, would the prospect of repealing the Affordable Care Act be greeted with equanimity by minority voters who have gained health coverage because of Obamacare? Or might they actually be willing to forgo the heady freedom of facing serious illness without proper medical care?\n\nIn a primary where most of the Republican candidates share similar views, those are probably questions for a later day. That is, for the general election, should Rubio or Cruz emerge as the GOP nominee.\n\nStill, substance usually matters in the end.\n\nWhich is to say this:\n\nAs inspiring as it is to see Republicans embracing diverse political champions, it may be that some of the party\u2019s tattered tenets need to reflect the modern world as well.", "article_metadata": {"eomportal-loid": "4.1.2514526387", "eomportal-id": 253541, "description": "Marco Rubio is selling youth, diversity, and charisma.
