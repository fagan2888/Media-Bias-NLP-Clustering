It accused Mr McGhie and the union of acting like a branch of the ALP, and said members of POP wanted to accept the latest pay offer from Ambulance Victoria to sign a new EBA.\n\nMr McGhie said he had never heard of a group called POP and suspected it was a fictitious creation by Health Department staff to try to fracture the union and pressure it into accepting a deal.\n\n\"It just goes to show what they will stoop to rather than putting their efforts into a positive negotiation process to try to get a positive outcome for all parties. I think it's a pretty low act,\" he said.\n\nMr McGhie said Mr Felle had represented the Health Department on behalf of the Victorian government and Health Minister David Davis at every meeting with the union since they started negotiating a new EBA in August 2012. If the POP group had been concocted by departmental staff, Mr McGhie said Mr Davis or some of his advisers were \"probably\" aware of it.\n\n\"There certainly needs to be some explanation to it,\" he said.\n\nOn Friday, opposition health spokesman Gavin Jennings questioned whether Mr Davis was involved in the creation of the potentially fake group and its letter, saying he had been at war with paramedics for more than two years.\n\n\"In that time, Mr Davis labelled paramedics 'hardline' and 'thugs', and accused them of exploiting the crisis in ambulance for their own benefit. But now we know that Mr Davis' representative at the negotiating table has been engaging in grubby underhanded politics,\" he said.\n\nA spokesman for Mr Davis did not answer questions about whether he had seen the letter or been involved in its creation. But he said the Health Department was seeking further information about \"the document in question and its origins\".\n\nMr Felle did not comment.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Victoria", "application-name": "The Age", "og": {"site_name": "The Age", "description": "The Victorian Health Department is investigating a potentially fraudulent campaign designed to destabilise the paramedics' union and end its long-running dispute with the government over pay and conditions.", "title": "Probe into fake letter claims at centre of paramedics pay dispute", "url": "http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/probe-into-fake-letter-claims-at-centre-of-paramedics-pay-dispute-20141004-10qb55.html", "image": "http://images.theage.com.au/2014/02/12/5155383/FAIRFAX-logo.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://images.theage.com.au/2014/02/12/5155383/FAIRFAX-logo.jpg"}, "description": "The Victorian Health Department is investigating a potentially fraudulent campaign designed to destabilise the paramedics' union and end its long-running dispute with the government over pay and conditions.", "site": "@theage", "card": "summary", "title": "Probe into fake letter claims at centre of paramedics pay dispute"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Open The Age", "robots": "ACAP allow-present prohibited-modification=annotation", "fb": {"app_id": 230318243699378}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.theage.com.au", "msapplication-task": "name=Weather;action-uri=http://www.theage.com.au/weather;icon-uri=http://www.theage.com.au/favicon.ico;", "description": "The Victorian Health Department is investigating a potentially fraudulent campaign designed to destabilise the paramedics' union and end its long-running ..."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb317\"", "article_summary": "The Victorian Health Department is investigating a potentially fraudulent campaign designed to destabilise the paramedics' union and end its long-running dispute with the government over pay and conditions.\nBut now we know that Mr Davis' representative at the negotiating table has been engaging in grubby underhanded politics,\" he said.\nIf the POP group had been concocted by departmental staff, Mr McGhie said Mr Davis or some of his advisers were \"probably\" aware of it.\n\"In that time, Mr Davis labelled paramedics 'hardline' and 'thugs', and accused them of exploiting the crisis in ambulance for their own benefit.\nAdvertisementAnother attachment was personal correspondence between Mr Felle and the Australian Taxation Office."}
