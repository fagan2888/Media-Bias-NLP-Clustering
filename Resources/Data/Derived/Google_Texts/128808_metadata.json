According to they survey's findings, the cost of employer health benefits slowed to 2.1% growth in 2013 - with the average cost per employee averaging $10,779/year (including medical, dental, and other health coverage). However, employers expect the rate of growth to rebound next year, to 5.2%.\n\nThe national survey included responses from ~2,800 public and private US organizations with 10 or more employees. Here's a review of their findings.\n\nSummary of Key Findings\n\nHealth benefits costs rose faster for very large employers (5,000+ employees) who saw average increases of 3.7% compared to ~1% for employers with less than 500 employees.\n\nThe rate of growth varied by US region. The South saw a 5.3% increase, Northeast a 3.3% increase, West a 1% increase, and Midwest only a 0.1% increase.\n\nTo reduce cost increases, small employers shifted more costs to employees via higher deductibles. Larger employers were more likely to use consumer-directed health plans or employee health management programs to control costs.\n\nLooking to 2014, employers anticipate increase costs to cover more employees, as it's anticipated fewer employees and dependents will opt out of employer coverage because of the individual mandate.\n\nFrom 2012 to 2013, consumer-directed health plans (CDHPs) rose from 16% to 18% of all covered employees, respectively. There are now as many CDHP enrollees as HMO enrollees nation-wide.\n\n6% of larger employers say they will terminate their employee health plans in the next five years in favor of the public health insurance exchanges.\n\nThe number of small employers that say they are likely to terminate their health plans in the next five years increased from 22% in 2012 to 31% in 2013.\n\nSource: Mercer National Survey of Employer-Sponsored Health Plans 2013\n\nChart Highlights\n\nSource and more charts here: Mercer National Survey of Employer-Sponsored Health Plans 2013\n\nMap source: Mercer via Business Insurance News.\n\nSurvey Methodology\n\nAccording to Mercer's website, the National Survey of Employer-Sponsored Health Plans is conducted using a national probability sample of public and private employers with at least 10 employees; 2,842 employers completed the survey in 2013. The survey was conducted during the late summer, when most employers have a good fix on their costs for the current year.
