We're not Johnny-come-latelies.\"\n\nHe also warned President Obama that the contraception mandate in his signature health care law might \u201cpush aside\u201d some of his biggest supporters.\n\n\u201cWe want to be with you. We want to be strong, and if you keep doing this, we\u2019re not going to be able to be one of your cheerleaders,\u201d said Dolan, several days after the Supreme Court agreed to hear a challenge to the mandate by the Christian-owned retail chain Hobby Lobby.\n\nDolan also said he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d that Congress has failed to pass immigration reform and put the blame on the Republican-led House that has yet to vote on the issue.\n\n\u201cYou guys have got to get your act together,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to let you guys off the hook. \u2026 We\u2019re disappointed.\u201d\n\nDolan also acknowledged that efforts to make same-sex marriage legal across the country appear to be gaining momentum.\n\n\"I think I'd be a Pollyanna to say there doesn't seem to be kind of a stampede to do this,\" he said. \"I regret that.\"\n\nHe also suggested the church has been \u201cout marketed\u201d on the issue by forces such as Hollywood and high-profile political leaders who support the change.", "article_metadata": {"classification": "/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/STATE AND LOCAL/States Rights,/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/STATE AND LOCAL/Legislation,/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/STATE AND
