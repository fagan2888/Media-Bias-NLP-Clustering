Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., a member of the committee who voted no.\n\nBut that wasn\u2019t the only reason some Republicans chose to oppose Lynch as Attorney General Eric Holder\u2019s replacement.\n\nEarlier this month, The Daily Signal reported on an investigation into Lynch\u2019s decision while serving as U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York to not bring criminal charges against banking giant HSBC for an alleged tax evasion scheme.\n\nThe bank also faced accusations that its employees funneled millions of dollars to the Iranian government, Middle Eastern terrorists and Mexican drug cartels.\n\n>>> Read More: Senator to Loretta Lynch: Why Did No One Go to Jail for Laundering Money to Terrorists?\n\nSen. David Vitter, R-La., a member of the Judiciary Committee, has been leading the probe into her decisions not to jail any HSBC employees for allegedly laundering more than $200 million through its U.S. branches and helping wealthy clients avoid paying taxes.\n\nHeadquartered in London, HSBC is one of the world\u2019s largest banking and financial services organizations serving some 51 million customers.\n\nInstead of criminally prosecuting individuals responsible for the money laundering scandal, Lynch helped negotiate a $1.92 billion dollar settlement with HSBC in December 2012.\n\nAs for the tax evasion scheme, nearly five years after the Justice Department became aware of the violation, it is still not publically known whether the government has criminally charged HSBC.\n\nMeanwhile, Swiss prosecutors raided the bank\u2019s Geneva headquarters last week over reports that HSBC\u2019s Swiss bank allowed clients to dodge taxes.\n\n\u201cMs. Lynch has made it clear that she will not stand up to President Obama\u2019s lawlessness, or even egregious cases of white collar crime like HSBC\u2019s money laundering and tax evasion,\u201d said Vitter today in a prepared statement.\n\nDuring her confirmation hearing for attorney general last month, Lynch said she has been \u201cvery aggressive\u201d in pursuing white-collar crime.\n\nLynch\u2019s Response to the HSBC Investigation\n\nEarlier this week, Lynch responded to inquires from Vitter about her decision to settle the terrorist case with HSBC\u2014and more importantly\u2014the Justice Department\u2019s decision not to go after the bank for its hand in an alleged tax evasion scheme.\n\nResponding to media reports that HSBC shielded clients from their tax liabilities, Lynch said she \u201cdoes not recall reviewing or being aware\u201d of such information.\n\n>>> Read More: Senator Raises More Questions Over HSBC Money Laundering Scandal\n\nVitter alleges that the Justice Department was aware of such allegations \u201cat least as early as April 2010,\u201d which was well before the December 2012 money laundering settlement was reached.\n\n\u201c[A]pparently this widely-available information never trickled-down to Ms. Lynch during her negotiations with HSBC for a deferred prosecution agreement,\u201d Vitter said.\n\nLynch maintains that the settlement with HSBC in the money laundering case\u2014which was negotiated by prosecutors in her former office\u2014does not restrict the Justice Department from pursuing future legal action for the alleged tax evasion scheme.\n\nShe would neither confirm nor deny the existence of any pending lawsuit.\n\n\u201cI am not in the position to comment \u2026 or even to confirm or deny any particular investigation,\u201d said Lynch in an official response to Vitter\u2019s inquiries. \u201c[B]ut if I am confirmed as Attorney General, I look forward to learning more about the Department\u2019s enforcement efforts in this area.\u201d\n\nThe American people \u201ccannot wait for Ms. Lynch\u2019s on-the-job training,\u201d said Vitter in response to her statement, adding:\n\n[T]hey need to know that crimes by banks\u2014no matter how big\u2014will be prosecuted in a timely manner so that their nest eggs are safe and our economy is protected from systemic financial catastrophe. Confirmation of Ms. Lynch would not inspire this much needed confidence.\n\nLynch said the punishment forced upon HSBC in the money laundering case was \u201cappropriate to address the compliance failures and sanctions violations.\u201d\n\nThe terms of the settlement, she said, are \u201cperhaps the most stringent ever imposed on a financial institution,\u201d within the scope the Justice Department was able to pursue.\n\nLynch\u2019s Long Resume\n\nLynch, if confirmed by the Senate, would be the first African-American woman to be the nation\u2019s top law enforcement official.\n\nSupporters praise Lynch for her role in prosecuting terrorism, civil rights and political corruption over a decorated prosecuting career.\n\n\u201cThere is good reason to believe that Ms. Lynch will be more independent than the current attorney general and make strides toward recommitting the department to the rule of law,\u201d said Hatch, a Republican who voted yes this morning.\n\nHatch said that Lynch\u2019s record \u201cdoes not include anything sufficient to overcome the presumption in favor of confirmation.\u201d\n\nThe Senate is expected to decide Lynch\u2019s fate in the next two weeks, in what is expected to be a contentious vote.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Despite criticism for her decision not to jail the perpetrators of a controversial white-collar crime, the nomination of Loretta Lynch moves forward.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Despite criticism for her decision not to jail the perpetrators of a controversial white-collar crime, the nomination of Loretta Lynch moves forward.", "title": "Lynch\u2019s Confirmation Moves Forward Despite HSBC Scandal", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/dpaphotostwo276846.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-02-26T15:49:14+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1MVrAXx"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Despite criticism for her decision not to jail the perpetrators of a controversial white-collar crime, the nomination of Loretta Lynch moves forward.", "title": "Lynch\u2019s Confirmation Moves Forward Despite HSBC Scandal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/dpaphotostwo276846.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Law", "tag": "nominations", "published_time": "2015-02-26T13:44:14+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-26T15:49:14+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "loretta lynch, lynch, hsbc, hsbc settlement, lynch hsbc, hsbc scandal, hsbc tax evasion, hsbc money laundering, vitter, david vitter"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc0be\"", "article_summary": "During her confirmation hearing for attorney general last month, Lynch said she has been \u201cvery aggressive\u201d in pursuing white-collar crime.\nBut that wasn\u2019t the only reason some Republicans chose to oppose Lynch as Attorney General Eric Holder\u2019s replacement.\nInstead of criminally prosecuting individuals responsible for the money laundering scandal, Lynch helped negotiate a $1.92 billion dollar settlement with HSBC in December 2012.\n>>> Read More: Senator to Loretta Lynch: Why Did No One Go to Jail for Laundering Money to Terrorists?\n>>> Read More: Senator Raises More Questions Over HSBC Money Laundering ScandalVitter alleges that the Justice Department was aware of such allegations \u201cat least as early as April 2010,\u201d which was well before the December 2012 money laundering settlement was reached."}
