Thousands of Oklahomans with disabilities and serious medical conditions depend on the program.\n\nCurrently, all states participate in Medicaid. However, Medicaid is an optional program for states to offer, Gomez said.\n\nTo participate in the program, the federal government requires states to provide a certain level of services to specific populations.\n\nIf Oklahoma can\u2019t afford to provide those services, the state wouldn\u2019t receive federal money to administer the program, which pays for more than half of the Medicaid expenses in Oklahoma.\n\nFiscal crisis\n\nThat\u2019s where the state\u2019s current fiscal crisis comes in.\n\nIn the past five years, the Health Care Authority has had to cut almost $500 million from the program, through limiting services available to SoonerCare members and cutting the amount of money the agency pays health care providers to deliver care.\n\nBy the end of June, Gomez anticipates the agency cutting $64 million from the program. Because the Medicaid program receives matching federal money, that cut in state money will mean $164 million in state and federal money no longer available.\n\nAdditionally, Gomez anticipates his agency will need to cut at least $100 million from its budget in the 2017 state fiscal year, which begins July 1.\n\nPlus, the state\u2019s finances aren\u2019t expected to improve, Gomez said.\n\n\u201cNo one believes the 2017 fiscal year cut will be the last cut,\u201d Gomez said. \u201cAnd if we think we\u2019re not going to be out of the woods by fiscal year 2018, we may be looking at more cut scenarios.\u201d\n\nGomez said beyond providing federally mandated services, he\u2019s also concerned Oklahoma won\u2019t be able to pay health care providers enough money for the care they deliver to Medicaid members.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t have appropriate access to care, then we shouldn\u2019t be in the business of having a Medicaid program, and our rates are that driving factor,\u201d Gomez said. \u201cAre providers as businesses going to be able to afford to take our rates and serve our people?\u201d\n\nFacing a potential $100 million budget cut, Gomez said he anticipates recommending significant provider rate cuts \u2014 at least a 12.5 percent rate cut. This is the largest provider rate cut the agency has considered in recent years.\n\nPresently, Medicaid pays physicians about 87 percent of what Medicare pays them to deliver care. With the 12.5 percent rate cut, physicians would be paid about 76 percent of what Medicare pays.\n\nGomez said he fears that if the agency must make that deep of a provider rate cut, providers will leave the program, unable to afford to give care to some of Oklahoma\u2019s poorest residents.\n\nLimited access\n\nWes Glinsmann, director of state legislative affairs at the Oklahoma State Medical Association, said a survey of 231 physicians in Oklahoma regarding Medicaid rates showed that many of the physicians surveyed would consider leaving the program if rate cuts above 10 percent were passed.\n\nPhysicians with independent practices often depend on Medicaid payments for their monthly bills because Medicaid pays physicians more promptly, often within seven to 10 days, versus private insurance companies that aren\u2019t that quick to reimburse.\n\nWithout the Medicaid program\u2019s payments, these physicians, especially in rural Oklahoma, would be left without an important piece of their business, Glinsmann said.\n\nAnd without these physicians in the program, thousands of Oklahomans will left without many care options.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to still see those people without access to care without physician care,\u201d Glinsmann said. \u201cThey\u2019re just going to end up in the emergency room, where your costs are going to be significantly higher on the back end.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s being done?\n\nRep. Doug Cox, who works as an emergency department physician in Grove, said he presented a bill earlier this month that would remove 111,000 adults from the state\u2019s Medicaid program.\n\nCox said he filed that legislation with the program\u2019s future in mind. The legislation would save the state an estimated $130 million, but the federal government would have to approve the move, Cox said.\n\nThe proposed legislation wouldn\u2019t affect low-income people who receive Medicaid benefits but are considered able-bodied, are not pregnant and are under 65 years old. Many in this group are single mothers.\n\nCox said the state Medicaid program is one of the largest expenses for the state, and it\u2019s alarming to think the state could be at a place where it could no longer afford to participate in the federal program.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I had suggested we ask the federal government for permission to eliminate services to the able-bodied adults,\u201d Cox said. \u201cThat alone is a tough thing to say because a lot of those are low-income single moms, but in order to have enough money to continue to serve the most vulnerable populations \u2014 seniors, children and pregnant women \u2014 we may have to eliminate something else.\u201d\n\nCox said he is even more concerned about the cuts to the Medicaid program because other state agencies that also serve low-income adults are cutting back, as well.\n\nThe state Health Department announced Tuesday that it would cut back funding for federally qualified health centers, which serve as safety net providers for thousands of Oklahomans. The agency no longer will pay these centers for the care they provide to uninsured Oklahomans who can\u2019t afford to pay.\n\nAdditionally, the Health Department is considering closing five to seven health departments, which further limits medical care options for thousands of Oklahomans, Cox said.\n\nLawmakers have been talking about the budget shortfall for several weeks, but the human faces affected by the cuts are beginning to emerge, Cox said.\n\n\u201cI think reality is truly setting in this week,\u201d Cox said.\n\nSome health care advocates and Democratic leaders have argued that some of Oklahoma\u2019s budget woes would be relieved if the state accepted federal money to expand its Medicaid program, a key provision of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nCox said he was originally a supporter of Medicaid expansion, which would provide coverage for thousands of low-income, uninsured adults.\n\nHowever, Cox said he doesn\u2019t think Medicaid expansion will happen in Oklahoma\u2019s current political climate.\n\n\u201cAnd so I\u2019m looking for other ways to help people have access to health care,\u201d Cox said. \u201cOne of the popular programs that Oklahoma can take great pride in is our Insure Oklahoma program, and I\u2019m looking for ways to allow more people to participate in that program.\u201d\n\nGomez said he hopes lawmakers will take time to contemplate long-term solutions that could help ensure the Medicaid program remains a financially viable option for the thousands of residents who depend on it to manage, for example, chronic, serious diseases.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe anybody wants to just continue down this road to where we have to make a decision on whether or not we can even afford a Medicaid program,\u201d Gomez said. \u201cIn my heart of hearts, I don\u2019t believe that.\u201d\n\nContributing: Rick M.
