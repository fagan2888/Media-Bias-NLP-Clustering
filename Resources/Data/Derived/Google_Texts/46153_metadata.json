But first: The latest health reforms on the Hill, and what we learned from HHS Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell's six-stop tour to pitch the White House budget.\n\nHOW WAYS & MEANS WILL TACKLE HEALTH CARE THIS YEAR \u2014 Chair Kevin Brady stressed that the panel will be \"very aggressive\" when tracking how CMS implements the MACRA physician payment law, even as the committee works to develop an alternative to Obamacare and reform hospital payment laws.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nIn an interview with Pro's Erin Mershon, Brady laid out priorities that include tackling cuts to hospital outpatient departments and changing post-acute care payments. And \"there could be bipartisan momentum\" to reform the Bipartisan Budget Act, which included a provision on so-called site neutrality for hospital payments, Brady said. The story for Pros: http://politico.pro/1M6c269\n\nSENATE HELP MARKS UP MENTAL HEALTH, OPIOID BILL \u2014 The Senate HELP Committee at 10 a.m. will mark up five pieces of bipartisan mental health reform and opioid abuse legislation, Pro's Brianna Ehley reports.\n\nThe committee will consider a manager\u2019s amendment to a broad mental health reform bill, and a manager\u2019s amendment to a substance abuse treatment bill, as well as smaller measures addressing substance abuse. The mental health reform bill was chiefly crafted by Chairman Lamar Alexander and ranking Senator Patty Murray but also takes language from a measure sponsored last summer by Sens. Chris Murphy and Bill Cassidy that will not be marked up.\n\n\u2014 Murray on the legislation: \u201cI'm glad that we\u2019ve established a strong, bipartisan foundation for work to improve care for mental illnesses and substance use disorders in our country,\" she said in a release. \"And I believe many of my colleagues, on both sides of the aisle, would agree that we should keep building on it.\"\n\nE&C CUTS $30 BILLION FROM HEALTH PROGRAMS \u2014 The House Energy and Commerce Committee on Monday approved roughly $30 billion in cuts to health programs despite Democratic claims that the GOP proposal was a rehashed attempt to undermine the ACA and shift costs to states. The story for Pros: http://politico.pro/1nMLtHs\n\n\u2014 CBPP's Bob Greenstein is concerned: \"The ACA has reduced the number of uninsured people by about 20 million; the budget would reverse those gains, and its deep additional Medicaid cuts would intensify the damage,\" the head of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities writes. http://bit.ly/1RNkt2F\n\nWELCOME TO WEDNESDAY PULSE \u2014 where we're still on schedule, despite the D.C. Metro system's best attempts to derail us. Tips to ddiamond@politico.com or @ddiamond on Twitter, and with help today from Brianna Ehley, Brett Norman and Sarah Karlin-Smith.\n\nWHAT WE LEARNED FROM BURWELL's BUDGET TOUR \u2014 HHS Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell on Tuesday concluded her six-stop tour to tout the budget to congressional committees, and PULSE pulls out three takeaways:\n\n\u2014 Everyone loves Sylvia. The Republican-led hearings were remarkably friendly, a distinct departure from the pitched battles that Congress fought with Burwell's predecessor, Kathleen Sebelius. \"They didn't lay a glove on you,\" Rep. Tom Cole joked to Burwell as one of those budget hearings, at a House Appropriations Subcommittee, drew to a close.\n\n\u2014 There's still a key fight over funding. While Republican leaders agreed that fighting opioid addiction is a top priority, Burwell carefully sidestepped some direct questions about the Senate's new legislation \u2014 the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act \u2014 which the White House has said lacks the necessary funds.\n\n\u2014 She celebrated wrapping up with an on-message rap. \"Just wrapped my sixth budget hearing,\" Burwell tweeted on Tuesday, a day after President Obama said she'd challenged him to a rap battle. \"I've got my mind on the budget and the budget on my mind.\"\n\n'THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT AND BEING PRESIDENT' \u2014 In her victory speech en route to sweeping last night's primaries, Hillary Clinton took a subtle shot at Bernie Sanders' Medicare-for-all plan, which many economists have said is prohibitively expensive and politically unworkable.\n\n\"Every candidate makes [big] promises \u2026 but every candidate owes it to you to be clear and direct about what our plans will cost and how we are going to make them work,\" Clinton said. \"That's the difference between running for president and being president.\"\n\n\u2014 Total votes on Super Threesday, by candidate\n\nPULSE's personal count, as of 4 a.m. ET\n\nClinton: 3.7 million votes\n\nTrump: 3.2 million\n\nSanders: 2.8 million\n\nCruz: 1.9 million\n\nKasich: 1.6 million\n\nRubio: 1.0 million\n\nICMYI: FDA PRIORITIZES REVIEW OF GENERIC DRUGS THAT ADDRESS MONOPOLY \u2014 FDA quietly updated a policy on Friday to expedite review of generic drug applications that are looking to copy a drug produced by only one company but not covered by any patents or other exclusivities.\n\nPro's Sarah Karlin-Smith points out that the move appears to be an agency solution to the Martin Shkreli problem \u2014 where the price of an old medicine can be jacked up exponentially because of insufficient competition. The new policy could expedite review of as many as 125 generic drug applications, FDA told Bloomberg. It's worth noting that priority review moves generic drugs to the front of the line, but does not guarantee an agency review within a particular time period. See the FDA notice: http://1.usa.gov/1R1dfZg\n\nCDC ISSUES SWEEPING GUIDELINES ON OPIOIDS \u2014 Officials are saying that Tuesday's guidelines are intended to \"turn around\" a culture of pain management that has largely overlooked the dangers of addiction, Pro's Brett Norman and Sarah Karlin-Smith report.\n\nCDC Director Tom Frieden says the guidelines send a message to primary care providers: the risks of addiction and death from opioids outweigh the benefits for \"the vast majority\" of patients suffering from chronic pain. The story for Pros: http://politico.pro/1QWbSxc\n\n\u2014 Why one expert expects the voluntary guidelines to become rules: \"I'm confident that we\u2019re going to see licensing boards and state regulatory agencies pick these up and turn them into laws and regulations and rules,\" Bob Twillman, executive director of the American Academy of Pain Management, told Pro's Brett Norman.\n\nHe said the dosing guidelines in particular were problematic. \"A lot of practitioners will take those numbers and make them ceiling doses \u2026 as if they are written in stone,\" Twillman said. Other doctors will say \"this is just too much \u2014 I\u2019m just going to avoid all the hassle and not prescribe them at all.\"\n\n** A message from National Community Pharmacists Association (NCPA): More transparency is needed into generic drug pricing and reimbursement rates set by drug plan middlemen. Bipartisan legislation (H.R. 244) would enhance oversight of federal health programs and help ensure pharmacy reimbursement for generic drugs reflects market fluctuations.

One proposal: \"We need a new specialized agency: a Public Health Emergency Management Agency,\" Klain writes. http://bit.ly/1QWMc3s\n\nHOUSE PANEL GRILLS OFFICIALS OVER FLINT CRISIS \u2014 Lawmakers on Tuesday spent hours blistering a former EPA official and two former leaders of Flint, Mich., POLITICO's Annie Snider reports. The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform is conducting an inquiry into why officials waited so long to address the city's toxic water, and the panel released a new batch of internal EPA emails yesterday.\n\nTwo key quotes\n\n\u2014 \"I'm not so sure Flint is the community we want to go out on a limb for \u2026 At least without a better understanding of where all that money went.\" - EPA official's email from September 2015\n\n\u2014 \"There's a special place in hell for actions like this.\" - Rep. Buddy Carter at yesterday's hearing\n\n\u2014 Next up: EPA chief Gina McCarthy and Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder will appear in front of the committee on Thursday.\n\nMEDPAC's NEW REPORT IS OUT \u2014 Among other recommendations, the commission suggested a slew of Medicare Advantage payment reforms, including doing away with caps on payment based on which county the plan operates in. The report: http://1.usa.gov/1UxyGpt\n\nVALEANT PLUNGES ON WALL STREET \u2014 The heavily scrutinized drug maker lost more than $11 billion in market value on Tuesday after executives said that Valeant's revising its strategy of hiking drug prices, lowering its quarterly guidance and may default on its debt. The only good news: Investors who shorted the stock made a killing.\n\nValeant's closing share price\n\n\u2014 Monday: $69.04\n\n\u2014 Tuesday: $33.51\n\nASCO WEIGHS IN ON STATE OF CANCER CARE \u2014 The American Society of Clinical Oncology's review of cancer care in America calls out major achievements \u2014 such as the declining mortality associated with breast, colorectal and cervical cancers \u2014 but notes that there's growing inequity based on affordability and availability of providers and testing. ASCO's report: http://bit.ly/1R1z8HW\n\n\u2014 Where cancer care could go. \"New approaches to cancer treatment are extending and improving lives, but they also raise tough questions about how to apply what we're learning for patients quickly, efficiently and equitably,\" ASCO president Julie Vose said. The organization calls on providers to implement tactics such as developing alternative payment models and applying lessons from the \"Choosing Wisely\" campaign to reduce waste and duplicative tests.\n\nHOW ANTI-VAXXERS HELPED SPREAD DISEASE \u2014 A new JAMA review confirms media reports from last year: Recent U.S. measles outbreaks have been sparked by intentionally unvaccinated individuals and further fueled by waning immunity in vaccinated people. http://bit.ly/1VbojIl\n\nSince measles was technically eliminated in the United States in 2000 \u2026\n\n\u2014 There have been at least 1,416 measles cases\n\n\u2014 56.8% of these measles patients were unvaccinated\n\n\u2014 70.6% of these unvaccinated patients claimed non-medical exemptions\n\nON THE HILL TODAY \u2014 The American Lung Association\u2019s \"LUNG FORCE Heroes\" \u2014 people who have been personally affected by lung cancer \u2014 will be lobbying lawmakers to increase funding for lung cancer.\n\nON A SAD NOTE \u2014 Many of you have heard by now of the death Monday of Peggy Girshman, one of the finest health and science journalists, a founding editor of Kaiser Health News, and a friend to many of us and our readers. (Pro's Jennifer Haberkorn calls her the \"kindest, funniest POLITICO Pulse tipster there ever was,\" and she was instrumental in helping me when I was first starting out in health journalism, too.)\n\nHere\u2019s a remembrance from NPR's Joe Neel http://n.pr/1S2a7ii and from the Association of Health Care Journalists. https://t.co/0ioVjmyf5O Miss you, Peg.\n\nWHAT WE'RE READING\n\nA New York City hospital executive quit over a $764 million electronic health record implementation that he compared to the Challenger space shuttle disaster: http://nyp.st/1Uyeynd\n\nAs part of her AHCJ-Commonwealth Fund project, Sarah Kliff digs into the reality of what happens when a provider makes a medical error \u2014 and the depression and tragedy that can follow these doctors and nurses as \"second victims\": http://bit.ly/1ptgphK\n\nA new JAMA viewpoint explores the challenges and opportunity of bundled payments: http://bit.ly/22l4Y9U\n\nDoes the FDA get enough love on the Hill? Ex-FDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg doesn't think so, and she tells STAT News's Rick Berke that the agency is chronically underfunded: http://bit.ly/1MlTNUW\n\nAustin Frakt argues that TV drug ads \u2014 yes, TV drug ads \u2014 can be helpful to patients after all: http://nyti.ms/22jjeTL\n\nPaul Levy \u2014 the hospital CEO who began blogging in 2006 and continued even after leaving health care \u2014 is officially hanging it up after 4,646 posts: http://bit.ly/1QWPjbJ\n\n** A message from National Community Pharmacists Association (NCPA): While approximately 80 percent of prescription drugs dispensed are generic drugs, the reimbursement system for these medications is largely unregulated and a mystery to pharmacists and patients. The lack of transparency also raises questions as to whether drug plan middlemen, pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) corporations, are overpaid by Medicare and other federal health programs. Moreover, when generic drug prices spike, PBM corporations are slow to update reimbursement rates, leaving community pharmacies with payments that don\u2019t cover costs and unsustainable financial losses. H.R. 244 would increase transparency and facilitate timely payment updates.
