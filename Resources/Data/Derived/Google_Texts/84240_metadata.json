No truce or cease fire with ISIS,\" added Syrian National Coalition spokesman Monzer Abkik.\n\nStill, the reports did nothing to allay the fears of lawmakers who are preparing for a potential vote on whether to approve the plan before Congress convenes for recess.\n\nSome lawmakers are concerned the weapons provided to the moderate Syrian opposition could fall into ISIS's hands.\n\nOther lawmakers distrust the rebels.\n\nSteven Sotloff, one of American journalists beheaded by ISIS, was believed to have been captured by moderate rebels in Syria, then sold to ISIS.\n\nA vote on a short-term spending bill was delayed last week after the White House asked House Republicans to attach the authorization to the bill.\n\nIt\u2019s also possible GOP leaders might decide to hold a separate vote on the authorization to equip the rebels.\n\nThe Hill was not able to immediately reach the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights after several requests for more information on its original report on the ceasefire.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "\"Not a single\" U.S.-vetted rebel group has entered into a truce with ISIS, an official said.", "description": "\"Not a single\" U.S.-vetted rebel group has entered into a truce with ISIS, an official said.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Kristina Wong", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "\"Not a single\" U.S.-vetted rebel group has entered into a truce with ISIS, an official said.", "title": "Syrian opposition: No ISIS cease-fire", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/defense/217652-syrian-opposition-no-isis-cease-fire", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T04:20:37-05:00", "type": "article"}, "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T04:20-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/defense/217652-syrian-opposition-no-isis-cease-fire", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "dcterms.date": "2014-09-14T06:22-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Kyle Balluck", "dcterms.type": "Text", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-14T06:22:45-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T04:20:37-05:00"}, "keywords": ",,", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/defense/217652-syrian-opposition-no-isis-cease-fire", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "\"Not a single\" U.S.-vetted rebel group has entered into a truce with ISIS, an official said.", "card": "summary", "title": "Syrian opposition: No ISIS cease-fire"}, "dcterms.title": "Syrian opposition: No ISIS cease-fire"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdeaee\"", "article_summary": "Any such deal between moderate Syrian opposition forces and ISIS could derail congressional support for President Obama's plan to train and equip the Syrian forces -- a key tenet of the president's strategy against ISIS.\nReports that the Syrian moderate opposition has entered into a cease-fire with the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) in a Damascus suburb are not true, according to Syrian National Coalition officials.\nSome lawmakers are concerned the weapons provided to the moderate Syrian opposition could fall into ISIS's hands.\nADVERTISEMENT\"Not a single\" U.S.-vetted rebel group has entered into a truce with ISIS, an unidentified senior Syrian National Coalition official told The Hill on Saturday.\nNo truce or cease fire with ISIS,\" added Syrian National Coalition spokesman Monzer Abkik."}
