However, some doctors have long experimented with ketamine as an off-label treatment for severely depressed patients, finding positive results in adults and children.\n\nKetamine brought \u201crapid\u201d antidepressant effects in patients with treatment-resistant depression, according to researchers at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. However, even as doctors prescribe ketamine to some patients, medical researchers hope to develop a drug similar to ketamine, given its hallucinatory effects and potential for abuse.\n\nThus, lead researcher Lisa Monteggia says a heart drug called memantine may provide similar antidepressant relief in such cases without the troublesome side effects of ketamine. Yet the researchers also acknowledge that metamine might not provide the same speed of relief that has become a defining trait of ketamine.\n\n\u201cAlthough, both ketamine and memantine have similar actions when nerve cells are active, under resting conditions, memantine is less effective in blocking nerve cell communication compared to ketamine,\u201d Monteggia said in a press statement. \u201cThis fundamental difference in their action could explain why memantine has not been effective as a rapid antidepressant.\u201d\n\nThrough poorly understood mechanisms, the two drugs alter signals from the NMDA receptors, particularly those associated with the effectiveness of other antidepressants. The neuroscientists say the new findings may help the development of new ways of blocking those receptors with fewer unsavory side effects.\n\nLast year, researcher Demitri Papolos of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, told NPR he\u2019d found success in using ketamine to treat children with bipolar disorder. In particular, a 7-year-old girl experienced rapid relief of symptoms after suffering severe nightmares, separation anxiety, and psychotic episodes. Only by chance was ketamine discovered as an experimental treatment for the girl, who received the drug as an anesthetic at a dental appointment.\n\n\u201cShe got ketamine, and for two weeks she was completely asymptomatic,\" Papolos said. \"We had never seen anything like it before.\" That was five years ago. Today, the girl is still taking ketamine and is still free of symptoms.\u201d\n\nPapolos says ketamine had two effects on patients: a lowered body temperature and rapid relief from anxiety.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "ketamine, ketamine and depression, ketamine and anxiety, special k and depression, ketamine and experimental, ketamine and experimental depression treatments", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Ketamine continues to show promise for treating severe depression resistant to traditional therapies.
