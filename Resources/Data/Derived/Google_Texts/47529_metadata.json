Johnny Joannou, D-Portsmouth, a lawyer who served in the General Assembly for 34 years and lost his seat in a June 2015 Democratic primary, died Friday at 76.\n\nJoannou lost to fellow Democrat Steve Heretick, who now holds the seat representing Portsmouth and Norfolk.\n\nGov. Terry McAuliffe backed Heretick in the primary. Joannou had opposed the expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, the governor\u2019s top priority.\n\n\u201cI am saddened by the passing of former Senator and Delegate Johnny Joannou,\u201d McAuliffe said in a statement.\n\n\u201cJohnny will be remembered for his decades of devoted service to his community and his commonwealth as a member of the General Assembly. My thoughts and prayers are with the family and friends who are grieving this loss today.\u201d\n\nSpeaker of the House Bill Howell, R-Stafford, said: \u201cParty labels were always an afterthought to Johnny; he did what he thought was right, and he wasn\u2019t afraid to tell you about it, either. The entire House of Delegates mourns the loss of a friend. Cessie and I are keeping Johnny\u2019s wife, Chris, and their family in our prayers.\u201d\n\nDel. Chris Jones, R-Suffolk, chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, said Joannou was one of his closest friends.\n\n\u201cJohnny was a man of great character,\u201d Jones said. \u201cI trusted and respected him deeply. His experience and understanding of state government made him an invaluable member of our committee. On behalf of the committee and its staff, I offer my deepest condolences to the Joannou family.\u201d\n\nSenate Majority Leader Thomas Norment, R-James City, also mourned Joannou\u2019s loss.\n\n\u201cHaving first been elected to the House during Mills Godwin\u2019s second term as governor, Delegate Joannou retained the dedication and pragmatism of the elected officials of his era,\u201d Norment said.\n\n\u201cAs a native son of Portsmouth, he proved to be an effective advocate and champion for the city he loved. Throughout his 13 terms in the House and two in the Senate, he placed principle and the interests of his district ahead of partisanship.\n\n\u201cHe was fiercely devoted to the people of Portsmouth and never shied away from reaching across the aisle to achieve positive results for the people who elected him to serve.\u201d\n\nRep. Robert \u201cBobby\u201d Scott, D-Newport News, called Joannou a friend and former colleague in the legislature.\n\n\u201cHe was well-known for being a talented lawyer and for his independence,\u201d Scott said.\n\n\u201cJohnny was always willing to work with both sides of the aisle and he fought hard to achieve results for his constituents, regardless of the political consequences,\u201d Scott said.
