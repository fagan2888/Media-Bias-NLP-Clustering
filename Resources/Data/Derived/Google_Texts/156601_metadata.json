I believe that scripture says that it\u2019s a sin but I always follow that up by saying you know what, we\u2019re not against anybody.\u201d\n\nKing pressed him to explain, commenting, \"How can it be if we don't know what causes it? You don't know why you're a heterosexual.\"\n\n\"There's a lot of things Larry that I don't understand- so I just don't want to preach on it, preach about it,\" Osteen said.\n\nKing enquired, \"Does gay marriage annoy you?\" Osteen said, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t annoy me. From a scripture point of view, it\u2019s not what my faith would teach, but it doesn\u2019t annoy me.\"\n\nThe interview with Larry King is another example of the somewhat mixed messages offered by Rev. Osteen on homosexuals.\n\n\n\nOn October 2, 2013 Pastor Osteen joined Josh Zepps on HuffPost Live for a more relaxed and intimate interview.\n\nZepps read a piece that he liked from Osteen's new book: \"It doesn't matter who likes you or doesn't like you, all that matters is that God likes you. He accepts you, he approves of you.\" Zepps followed up by asking if that included homosexuals.\n\n\"Absolutely,\" Osteen insisted, \"I believe that God breathed life into every person and that every person is made in the image of God and you have accept them as they are, on their journey. I'm not here to preach hate or push people down.\"\n\nPastor Osteen also shared his thoughts with Larry King on the new pope, whom he likes, and told King, \"I believe Heaven is a physical place somewhere.\n\nAlso on HuffPost: Statements On LGBT People From Faith Leaders Statements On LGBT People From Faith Leaders\n\n1 of 13 Archbishop Desmond Tutu \"Desmond Tutu leaves no doubt about his opinions regarding LGTB rights, declaring: 'I would not worship a God who is homophobic and that is how deeply I feel about this.'
