The $90 million expansion would double the emergency room and add a five-story, 160-bed tower.\n\nIf all goes according to plan, the hospital would add 26 bays to its ER by the end of 2016 and open the new tower by the end of 2017. Hospital Administrator Ken Bradley says the hospital is looking to build now because the community is growing: In particular, senior citizens.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re living longer, which is a wonderful trend, but as our community and as our citizens age, their need for health care services in some cases go up exponentially,\u201d Bradley said.\n\nThe hospital already has a senior ER, and plans to tailor more programs for the elderly. The public will have the chance to comment on the plans August 4 and August 28.\n\nCheck here for more on those meetings.\n\nAbe Aboraya is a reporter for WMFE in Orlando.
