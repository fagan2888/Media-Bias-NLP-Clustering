The SWAT team from the Arapahoe County Sheriff’s Office surrounded a house Sunday night after a man inside fired a shot at deputies.

It was not clear what caused them to respond to the area.

“Our deputies are fine. Nobody was hit,” sheriff’s department spokeswoman Julie Brooks said.

SWAT commanders weren’t certain whether there was anybody else in the house on the 20400 block of East Hampden Avenue.
