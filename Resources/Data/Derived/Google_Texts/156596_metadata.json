GCHQ agents watched as Guardian staffers went to their basement and attacked the machine with disc grinders and other tools. The destruction was ordered by Prime Minister David Cameron, even though newspaper editors had told GCHQ officials that copies of the documents were also stored outside the country.\n\n\u201cThe Guardian continued to report on the Snowden data from America,\u201d the museum says in a label.\n\nDocuments released under the Freedom of Information Act last summer showed that the Obama administration knew that the British were intending to force the newspaper to smash the laptop. At least one NSA official said it was \u201cgood news.\u201d\n\nKieran Long, a senior curator at the museum, told The Guardian earlier this year that it had decided to include the machine in its exhibit when a medieval scholar had pointed out how the museum's own artifacts were destroyed by the government in centuries past.\n\nThe free exhibition, titled \u201cAll of This Belongs to You,\u201d is running from April 1 to July 19. It was designed to be shown in the run-up to the U.K.\u2019s election day on May 7.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The laptop was destroyed under watch from British spy officials.", "description": "The laptop was destroyed under watch from British spy officials.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Julian Hattem", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The laptop was destroyed under watch from British spy officials.", "title": "Smashed Snowden laptop on display in British museum", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/237880-smashed-snowden-laptop-on-display-in-british-museum", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/blogs/snowdenedward_040814getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T03:39-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/237880-smashed-snowden-laptop-on-display-in-british-museum", "dcterms.date": "2015-04-03T16:36-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Julian Hattem", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Government Communications Headquarters, The Guardian,,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-03T16:36:37-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/237880-smashed-snowden-laptop-on-display-in-british-museum", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The laptop was destroyed under watch from British spy officials.", "card": "summary", "title": "Smashed Snowden laptop on display in British museum"}, "dcterms.title": "Smashed Snowden laptop on display in British museum"}, "article_summary": "A laptop that was used to store leaked files from Edward Snowden and then destroyed under watch from U.K. intelligence officers is now on display at a prominent London museum.\n\u201cThe Guardian continued to report on the Snowden data from America,\u201d the museum says in a label.\nDocuments released under the Freedom of Information Act last summer showed that the Obama administration knew that the British were intending to force the newspaper to smash the laptop.\nGCHQ agents watched as Guardian staffers went to their basement and attacked the machine with disc grinders and other tools.\nIt was designed to be shown in the run-up to the U.K.\u2019s election day on May 7."}
