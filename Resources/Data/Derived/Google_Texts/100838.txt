Rep. Allan Rothlisberg, R-Junction City, has suggested that women over the age of 50 do not require gynecological services.

Perhaps one of the state’s ladies would like to explain to Rothlisberg why women over the age of 50 still require gynecological care, but don’t require obstetric care? Then can we commit to never letting any men as ill-informed as Rothlisberg anywhere near a place where decisions regarding women’s reproductive health are being made?

When did the men in Kansas get so stupid?
