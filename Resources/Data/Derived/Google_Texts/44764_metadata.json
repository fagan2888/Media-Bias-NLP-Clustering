Or at least, if he is a socialist, he is also, at the same time, a capitalist.\n\n\u201cI think Bernie Sanders\u2019s use of the word \u2018socialism\u2019 is causing much more confusion than it is adding value,\u201d said Lane Kenworthy, a professor of sociology at the University of California at San Diego. Mr. Kenworthy, who recently wrote a book called \u201cSocial Democratic America\u201d and thinks about these sorts of things for a living, offered a suggestion: \u201cHe is, if you want to put it this way, a democratic socialist capitalist.\u201d\n\nUgh. Do we have to put it that way? In addition to being a mouthful, that still seems as if it\u2019s going to confuse a lot of people.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAfter all, Mr. Sanders does not want to nationalize the steel mills or the auto companies or even the banks. Like Mrs. Clinton, he believes in a mixed economy, where capitalist institutions are mediated through taxes and regulation. He just wants more taxes and more regulation than Mrs. Clinton does. He certainly seems like a regular Democrat, only more so.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not socialism, it\u2019s social democracy, which is a big difference,\u201d said Mike Konczal, an economic policy expert at the left-wing Roosevelt Institute. Social democracy, Mr. Konczal noted, \u201cimplies a very active role for capitalism in the framework.\u201d\n\nSocial democracy, Mr. Sanders will have you remember, is not what they were up to in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. It\u2019s the little-of-this, little-of-that philosophy of parties like Labour in Britain or the Social Democrats in Germany. Such parties have abandoned their past support for the nationalization of industry and have presided for long periods over economies that certainly appeared capitalist to visiting American tourists, albeit with higher taxes than we have in the United States.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Sanders himself emphasizes the \u201cdemocratic\u201d part of democratic socialism, and promised in last week\u2019s debate that \u201cwe\u2019re gonna explain what democratic socialism is.\u201d He cited Denmark, which has very high taxes, very generous social programs and a robust economy driven by private capital investment, as an example of a place that does social democracy really well. (Though, as Matt Yglesias at Vox noted, Denmark\u2019s Social Democrats have been out of power for 11 of the last 15 years while the country\u2019s policies have continued to look pretty social democratic, further highlighting the difficulty of figuring out who\u2019s really a socialist or not, or what.)\n\nMr. Konczal laid out four hallmarks. You might be a social democrat if you support: a mixed economy, that is, a combination of private enterprise and government spending; social insurance programs that support the old and the poor; a Keynesian economic policy of government borrowing and spending to offset economic recessions; and democratic participation in government and the workplace.\n\nIf that\u2019s what social democracy is, it\u2019s not obvious what the term would add to the American political lexicon. Most Democrats would tell you they support all four of those things. So would quite a few Republicans.\n\nMr. Sanders said on the campaign trail this week that police and fire departments are \u201csocialist institutions,\u201d as are public libraries. He noted that Social Security and Medicare, which are very popular with Americans, are \u201csocialist programs.\u201d This, again, is more confusing than clarifying. If supporting Social Security and public firefighting makes you a social democrat, the term does nothing to distinguish Mr. Sanders from his opponents.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at the policies, there\u2019s a way to see it as Bernie has cranked up Hillary\u2019s agenda to 11,\u201d Mr. Konczal said. To wit: Mrs. Clinton favors preserving Social Security with some enhancements for the poorest beneficiaries, while he wants to raise taxes on the rich to expand it in ways that could add $65 per month to the average benefit. This, like most political debates, is a disagreement about how far to turn the knobs when adjusting policy; it does not seem to call for a separate ideological label.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThat said, Mr. Konczal did offer one difference between Mr. Sanders\u2019s and Mrs. Clinton\u2019s worldviews that is of kind rather than degree. This is decommodification: the idea that some goods and services are so important that they ought to be removed from the market economy altogether.\n\nThe idea behind the Affordable Care Act, and behind Mrs. Clinton\u2019s approach to tinkering with Obamacare, is that quality health insurance should be affordable to everyone, and that people who can\u2019t afford it should be given subsidies to buy it. For a democratic socialist, that\u2019s not good enough; instead, health care should simply be provided to everyone without charge, removing the profit motive from health care.\n\nBut even this is a matter of degrees. Mr. Sanders favors Medicare for all: a single-payer health care system, with the federal government as the sole insurer. This would remove the profit motive from health insurance but not from health care, which could continue to be provided by private doctors and hospitals, often working on a for-profit basis. Mr. Sanders is not proposing to go further, like Britain, and have doctors work directly for the government. Nor does he appear inclined to decommodify broad swathes of the economy; in other countries, even conservatives often endorse special, less-marketized rules for health care than for other sectors.\n\nThis distinction is real, but it\u2019s not clear to me that it merits Mr. Sanders his own ideological label. So when Mr. Kenworthy, the California professor, proposed the \u201cdemocratic socialist capitalist\u201d label to me, I responded by asking how that\u2019s different from being a very liberal Democrat.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there is a difference,\u201d he said. As such, I hope Mr. Sanders is not too offended if I simply describe him as \u201cvery liberal.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20151020033003, "twitter": {"description": "The senator from Vermont calls himself a socialist, but he doesn\u2019t want to nationalize the steel mills.
