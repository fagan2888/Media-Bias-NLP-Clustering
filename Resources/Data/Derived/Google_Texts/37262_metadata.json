Mike Huckabee on Tuesday offered up some words of advice to fans of Sen. Ted Cruz who haven\u2019t liked his criticism of the Texas Republican\u2019s tactics: \u201cGet over it.\u201d\n\nThe radio host told his listeners that although \u201cso many people have been mad\u201d at him for questioning Cruz\u2019s effort to defund Obamacare, he was standing by his critique of the senator.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve questioned whether or not what he did was the best thing for this argument,\u201d he said on \u201cThe Mike Huckabee Show.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t like Ted Cruz. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m disrespecting Ted Cruz. You know, I\u2019ve found that some people, if you say anything other than Ted Cruz is the greatest living senator that America has ever had, they\u2019re mad at you.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, get over it,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m going to call it like I see it, folks.\u201d\n\nAnd in this case, Huckabee said, \u201cI\u2019m telling you that it\u2019s harder to get 60 Democrats to vote against their party and their president than it is to get 51. And so I\u2019m sticking by this.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd the reason that a lot of the very conservative Republican senators\u2026 were completely against this whole effort and move was because they knew what they were doing was moving toward a situation that they could not get themselves out of,\u201d he said.\n\nHuckabee again knocked Cruz\u2019s marathon speech on the Senate floor, noting it \u201cwas not a filibuster.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think the one thing that he did that was valuable, he brought out a lot of things about Obamacare that we needed all to know and be reminded of,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the unfortunate thing, that vote still went forward. He didn\u2019t stop the progress or the flow of the Senate business.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "The former Arkansas governor says he stands by his critique of the senator.", "title": "Huckabee to Cruz fans: 'Get over it'", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2013/10/mike-huckabee-ted-cruz-fans-get-over-it-98339.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2012/10/121031_mike_huckabee_reuters_328.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Mike Huckabee,Government Shutdown (740),Ted Cruz", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "The former Arkansas governor says he stands by his critique of the senator.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc2a5\"", "article_summary": "| REUTERS Huckabee to Cruz fans: 'Get over it'Former Arkansas Gov.\nIt\u2019s not that I\u2019m disrespecting Ted Cruz.\nStory Continued Below\u201cI\u2019ve questioned whether or not what he did was the best thing for this argument,\u201d he said on \u201cThe Mike Huckabee Show.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t like Ted Cruz.\nYou know, I\u2019ve found that some people, if you say anything other than Ted Cruz is the greatest living senator that America has ever had, they\u2019re mad at you.\u201d\u201cWell, get over it,\u201d he said.\nHuckabee again knocked Cruz\u2019s marathon speech on the Senate floor."}
