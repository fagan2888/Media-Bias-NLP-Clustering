Matt Bevin warmed to the Medicaid expansion in the 2010 health care overhaul quickly after taking office last month.\n\nAt a Dec. 30 press conference, Bevin \u2014 a Republican who narrowly won his party\u2019s primary and was elected by a wide margin in November \u2014 announced he plans to keep the Obamacare expansion in place, albeit with some tweaks that may or may not be acceptable to federal regulators.\n\nMimicking a tactic of Republican supporters of the Affordable Care Act in other states, Bevin called for adjustments to Medicaid expansion as part of broader reforms to make Kentuckians \u201cas undependent as possible\u201d on welfare spending.\n\nObamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion adds childless, able-bodied, working-age adults to a program previously meant for pregnant women, the elderly, the disabled, children and impoverished families. More than 400,000 Kentuckians have enrolled in the welfare expansion since January 2014.\n\nDuring his campaign, Bevin pledged to roll back the Medicaid expansion his Democrat predecessor, Steve Beshear, implemented without the Kentucky Legislature\u2019s approval.\n\n\u201cNo question about it, I would reverse that immediately,\u201d Bevin said in February.\n\nClick here for more from Watchdog.org", "article_metadata": {"prism.subsection1": "state-local", "classification": "/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/STATE AND LOCAL/Issues", "dcterms.modified": "2016-01-08 05:49:38 EST", "dcterms.abstract": "Kentucky Gov.
