Local business owner Kenny Peoples thought he'd lost everything after his trailer was stolen last week.

After he was set back thousands of dollars, the community is coming together.

Peoples started his business, Peoples Lawn and Irrigation in Panama City nearly two decades ago. And sometime Tuesday, his trailer was stolen off of a storage lot on South Thomas Drive.

"It had two commercial-grade mowers," People said. "Five weed eaters, one edger, hedge trimmers, blowers. The trailer itself was a 24-foot enclosed trailer."

Worth more than $23,000, a 15-year investment, and Peoples' livelihood. Despite the loss, he's found a silver lining: An outpouring of support from friends and clients.

"I told the sheriff [deputy], it's almost like somebody hit me in the stomach," Peoples said. "I ain't never had nobody steal everything that I work with. It's like a carpenter losing everything he works with."

Dozens of shares on Facebook warn friends to be on the lookout for the trailer.

"Facebook friends, and clientele big time," he said. "I've got two or three people that's comes forward and said they'd pretty much help me try to rebuild in everything, so I mean, I might have to take them up on it."

The help goes beyond social media. Peoples' clients are offering the tools and funds to get the business up and running again.

"One of them said that they had lose everything in Katrina," he said. "They said they know exactly how this is. So, they called me, took initiative."

And Peoples said every little bit counts.

"I don't have a huge company, but it means a lot to me and to my family," he said.
