In a competitive industry that\u2019s changing rapidly, the obstacles are many. But knowledge is power, as they say, so in Retirement Advisor\u2019s recent Advisor Survey we asked your peers to name these obstacles directly. The answers ran the gamut from specific product concerns to looming legislation worries to straightforward sales hurdles that would resonate equally with those who sell houses or medical equipment or tax planning advice. Following are the five obstacles that independent insurance agents say are the most significant they\u2019ll face this year, along with suggestions for how to meet them head-on.

Lead generation (50.59%) Selling insurance products comes with its own unique set of lead gen challenges, not least among them the fact that prospects are either a) reluctant to admit they need what you\u2019re selling, as is often the case with life insurance products or b) afraid to plan for one of their own looming obstacles, namely, how they will fund their retirement.\n\n2. The economy (44.71%) The U.S. economy is making baby strides back to full health, but we\u2019re still nowhere near the flush years of the late \u201880s and \u201890s. Prospects must make calculated calls about how to invest their money. There is also the fear factor: plenty of consumers are hesitant to trust financial advisors of all stripes, with insurance advisors on the low end of the spectrum. A recent Deloitte study revealed that just 20 percent of consumers believe banks to be highly trustworthy, while 14 percent highly trust life insurers; 13 percent, annuity carriers; and 11 percent, insurance agents and brokers.\n\n3. Health care reform (35.29%) The beast that reared its head in early 2010 with the signing of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act shows few signs of quieting five years later. More than a year after the act was formally rolled out, consumers still have questions about their coverage options, fears over losing favored provider access and doubts that they can afford the level of coverage they need.\n\n4. Industry legislation (20%) It\u2019s been a busy few days in Washington, as anyone following the ongoing debate over the DOL fiduciary standard will tell you. This piece of legislation \u2014 still in its drafting stage \u2014 is just one of the regulatory items awaiting resolution, effectively creating a waiting game for advisors. When resolution will actually come is anyone\u2019s guess, but the prospect of tighter industry regulation in coming years seems certain. And it\u2019s one certainty that leaves uncertainty in its wake. It\u2019s difficult to play when you don\u2019t know the rules of the game. Your clients may not face the same oversight concerns, but they are none too pleased with the current state of government themselves. When asked about the biggest fears clients are facing, 47 percent of survey respondents listed the government as a source of fear.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Nichole Morford", "description": "Selling insurance is important but challenging work.
