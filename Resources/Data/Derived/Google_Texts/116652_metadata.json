And risk, after all, is what auto insurers try to avoid.\n\n\n\nBut what the industry is really avoiding, says the Consumer Federation of America, is rewarding low-mileage, safer drivers with better rates.\n\n\"Large auto insurers frequently fail to reward drivers with low mileage despite a strong relationship between this mileage and insurance claims,\" the CFA says in a study. \"In fact, three of the five largest insurers often give low-mileage drivers no break at all\" \u2014 despite 61% of U.S auto insurance consumers saying mileage should be a factor in determining auto insurance costs.\n\n\n\nWorse, in the opinion of the CFA, is that the auto insurance industry is sticking it to demographic groups who can afford it the least. \"The failure of most large insurers to adequately reward low mileage especially harms lower-income and older drivers, because they drive the least,\" says Stephen Brobeck, executive director. \"This lack of concern for mileage, along with an emphasis on other non-driving factors such as occupation and income, help explain why insurers charge many lower-income drivers such high prices for minimal, state-required liability coverage,\" he adds.\n\n\n\nThe CFA looked at some of the biggest auto insurers in the nation, including State Farm, Allstate, Progressive, Geico and Farmers. Using a sample driver (a 30-year-old single women with no history of accidents or traffic tickets driving a 2005 sedan on a $30,000 salary), the CFA compared insurance quotes for 5,000 and 20,000 miles annually. In 49 states \u2014 California mandates that auto insurers use mileage when formulating insurance costs \u2014 Farmers, Progressive, and Allstate provided the same yearly premium for both the 5,000 and 20,000 miles driven.", "article_metadata": {"layout": "main", "description": "Auto insurance companies seem to be taking low-risk drivers for granted, but consumers aren't standing for it.", "author": "Brian O'Connell", "og": {"site_name": "MainStreet", "description": "Auto insurance companies seem to be taking low-risk drivers for granted, but consumers aren't standing for it.", "title": "Most Big Auto Insurers Are Just Taking Advantage of Your Low-Mileage Driving", "url": "https://www.mainstreet.com/article/most-big-auto-insurers-are-just-taking-advantage-of-your-low-mileage-driving", "image": {"width": 600, "secure_url": "https://s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/walkingandbiking.jpg", "identifier": "https://s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/walkingandbiking.jpg", "height": 400}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "section": "Insurance", "keywords": "auto, auto insurance, auto insurance rates, low mileage drivers, low mileage insurance, Geico, State Farm", "fb": {"app_id": 925400040808836}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MainStreet", "section": "Insurance", "tag": "State Farm", "published_time": "2015-05-28T11:00Z", "author": "https://www.mainstreet.com/author/459200"}, "date": "2015-05-28T11:00Z", "contentType": "article", "guid": 13165352, "twitter": {"description": "Auto insurance companies seem to be taking low-risk drivers for granted, but consumers aren't standing for it.", "title": "Most Big Auto Insurers Are Just Taking Advantage of Your Low-Mileage Driving", "url": "https://www.mainstreet.com/article/most-big-auto-insurers-are-just-taking-advantage-of-your-low-mileage-driving", "image": {"src": "https://s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/walkingandbiking.jpg", "identifier": "https://s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/walkingandbiking.jpg"}, "site": "@mainstr", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "auto, auto insurance, auto insurance rates, low mileage drivers, low mileage insurance, Geico, State Farm"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd33c2\"", "article_summary": "The CFA looked at some of the biggest auto insurers in the nation, including State Farm, Allstate, Progressive, Geico and Farmers.\n\"In fact, three of the five largest insurers often give low-mileage drivers no break at all\" \u2014 despite 61% of U.S auto insurance consumers saying mileage should be a factor in determining auto insurance costs.\nAnd risk, after all, is what auto insurers try to avoid.\n\"Large auto insurers frequently fail to reward drivers with low mileage despite a strong relationship between this mileage and insurance claims,\" the CFA says in a study.\nWorse, in the opinion of the CFA, is that the auto insurance industry is sticking it to demographic groups who can afford it the least."}
