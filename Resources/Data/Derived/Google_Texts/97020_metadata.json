A Tesla -- specifically a Tesla Model S P85D, the $120,000 electric speedster with a 221-horsepower front motor and a 470-horsepower rear motor.\n\nHitting the \"insane\" button engages both at the same time, allowing you to reach 60 mph in just over 3 seconds -- and scare the pants off friends and family members, if you use it without warning.\n\nBrooks Weisblat of the DragTimes website did just that in the clip above.\n\n\"With 0-60 MPH coming in just 3.1 seconds along with no audible clue of what\u2019s about to happen, the aggressive launch brings out some very interesting and funny reactions, including a flying iPhone that gets stuck to the back seat from the G Forces,\" Weisblat wrote on his blog.\n\nWhile his passengers freak out like kids on a roller coaster, Weisblat says the whole experience is about as safe as rapid acceleration could possibly be.\n\n\"It's very safe, the car has all-wheel drive and is very stable the entire time,\" Weisblat told Mashable. \"We've even done 0-60 in 3.3 seconds in the rain with no tire spin at all.\"\n\nIt's not quite the \"ludicrous speed\" mode of Spaceball One, but it might be about as close as you'll get in a mass-produced automobile.\n\nThe video even caught the attention of Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who tweeted a link to it on Tuesday night:\n\nGreat DragTimes video of people experiencing P85D \"Insane Mode\" acceleration for the first time https://t.co/gqN9oremMQ \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 28, 2015\n\nFor a little more fun, check out a second version of the video, which contains some NSFW language:", "article_metadata": {"description": "What kind of car would come with an \"insane\" mode?
