That is the lowest uninsured rate since Gallup began tracking coverage statistics in 2008.\n\n\n\nDavis, who is the head of one of the nation's largest health-care systems, added that the law was designed to hit three objectives: improving access and quality as well as decreased cost.\n\nRead MoreObamacare toothache! Enrollment numbers were juiced up\n\n\"There are things in the ACA that have mandated changes in quality,\" Davis continued. \"We have fewer hospital readmissions, and we have few hospital-acquired infections.\"\n\nHowever, the third and most difficult objective that the health-care industry grapples with is cost, also known in industry circles as \"bending the cost curve.\" Health-care inflation rates have slowed, Davis said, although not fast enough for some.\n\n\"The rate of increase in Medicare and Medicaid expenditures is diminishing,\" Davis explained. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services estimate spending growth in 2014 of 4.2 percent for Medicare and 12.8 percent for Medicaid.\n\nRead MoreObamacare's fewer fans, more enrollees\n\n\"What we're seeing is the decrease in revenues that have been associated with so many aspects of policy\" associated with federal health-care costs, Davis said. \"What we see is shrinking margins [but] increased pressure on the hospitals.\"\n\nOverseeing the seven-campus health system with more than 3,500 patient beds, Davis believes that the financial disadvantage the Affordable Care Act presented to hospitals can only be addressed one way: by reinventing the health-care business model from pay-per-service to a population management approach.\n\nPopulation management offers a centralized source for health-care services to patients\u2014from primary care to specialists or diagnostic visits\u2014 under one corporate roof. Still, it's just a first step.\n\n\"Bending the cost curve in health care has got to be the focus of everybody's attention\u2014all the policymakers,\" contended Davis.\n\nThe CEO offered a few objectives that could revitalize health-care policy. These include addressing how end-of-life Medicare costs have ballooned; raising consumer awareness about the dangers of rising obesity; and pharmaceutical drug development designed to look beyond treating symptoms of chronic diseases.\n\n\"We've only begun to scratch the surface, because a lot of the most difficult issues we don't deal with,\" Davis said.", "article_metadata": {"AssetType": "blogpost", "description": "Despite the endless controversies dogging Obamacare, the CEO of Mount Sinai Health Systems believes the legislation is meeting many of its goals.", "author": "Katie Kramer", "og": {"site_name": "CNBC", "description": "Despite the endless controversies dogging Obamacare, the CEO of Mount Sinai believes the legislation is meeting many of its goals.", "title": "I believe in Obamacare: Mount Sinai Health CEO", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2014/11/21/mount-sinai-chief-obamacare-is-working.html", "image": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2014/08/05/101895740-453179414.1910x1000.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Despite the endless controversies dogging Obamacare, the CEO of Mount Sinai believes the legislation is meeting many of its goals.", "title": "Mount Sinai chief: Obamacare is working", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2014/11/21/mount-sinai-chief-obamacare-is-working.html", "image": {"src": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2014/08/05/101895740-453179414.1910x1000.jpg"}, "creator": "@Kramer_Katie", "site": "@CNBC", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"ios": {"app_name": "CNBC Business News and Finance", "app_store_id": 398018310}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=398018310", "GOOGLEBOT": "unavailable_after: 31 Dec 9999 23:59:59 GMT", "keywords": "On The Money, Health Care, Hospitals, On The Money, Obamacare, business news", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cnbc", "published_time": "2014-11-22T12:00:00-0500", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/CNBC", "section": "On The Money", "modified_time": "2014-11-22T12:09:43-0500", "tag": "Obamacare"}, "pageNodeId": 102208216, "news_keywords": "Mount Sinai, Obamacare works, meeting its goals, davis, believe in"}, "article_summary": "Enrollment numbers were juiced up\"There are things in the ACA that have mandated changes in quality,\" Davis continued.\nThe CEO offered a few objectives that could revitalize health-care policy.\nPopulation management offers a centralized source for health-care services to patients\u2014from primary care to specialists or diagnostic visits\u2014 under one corporate roof.\n\"Bending the cost curve in health care has got to be the focus of everybody's attention\u2014all the policymakers,\" contended Davis.\nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services estimate spending growth in 2014 of 4.2 percent for Medicare and 12.8 percent for Medicaid."}
