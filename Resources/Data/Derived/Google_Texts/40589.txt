Monica Folts and her husband, Brian Folts, have an unusual way of training for marathons, triathlons and even the Pikes Peak Ascent. They do most of their running on side-by-side treadmills in the basement of their Lakewood home before dawn, watching TV.

They love to watch Jimmy Fallon. Sometimes she makes him watch Grey’s Anatomy.

“That’s the bad morning for me,” he said.

It’s working for them, though. She won the Rock “N’ Roll Denver Marathon women’s title Sunday in 2 hours, 58 minutes, 22 seconds. He finished seventh among the men in 2:47:05.

“It’s my first time ever breaking three hours,” she said. “It’s been a goal of mine forever, and I can’t believe I did it. It’s amazing.”

They do their weekend long runs outside, but they do the rest of their running on the treadmills before work, starting at 5:30 a.m. After running for 60-90 minutes they bike to work downtown.

Brian has always liked running on the treadmill, a contraption some runners call the “Dreadmill” when they are forced to run indoors.

“I’ve always liked it,” he said. “I got her into it. It’s always just been easier to me.”
