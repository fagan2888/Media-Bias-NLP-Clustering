Brussels, Belgium

Either the rules for who can take part in marathons are being relaxed, or there was a herd of zebras on the loose in Brussels.

That’s right, a group of zebras, also known as a ‘dazzle’, were spotted running around the capital of Belgium Friday.

Three of the black-and-white animals were first seen at the Van Praet Tunnel, and police believe they escaped from a local zebra ranch.

Confused onlookers snapped many images and videos of the graceful animals as they pranced around the city, however police have confirmed they have now been caught.

No one was believed to have been injured by the escaped zebras, although many people’s excuses for why they were late to school or work were probably not believed.
