Trey Gowdy (R-SC) earlier this week [see update \u2013 from late last year], but Real Clear Politics picked it up today, and it\u2019s definitely worth a fresh look. As the newly-appointed chair of the select committee investigating Benghazi, Gowdy has bristled at criticisms that all of the questions have already been answered \u2014 especially when those criticisms come from national media outlets who have shown remarkably little curiosity about the collapse of American policy in Libya. In his presser, Gowdy challenged the critics to answer the questions his committee will probe \u2014 or at least to start asking them:\n\n\u201cWe will not waver in our commitment to see that justice is done for this terrible act in Benghazi, and make no mistake, justice will be done.\u201d That was the president of the United States over a year ago.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re investigating exactly what happened, but my biggest priority now is bringing those folks to justice.\u201d That was the president of the United States over a year ago. No one has been arrested. No one has been prosecuted. No one has been brought to justice. We don\u2019t even have access to the witnesses.\n\nYou in the media were good enough for my 16 years as a prosecutor not to tell me how to do my job, and so far in Congress, y\u2019all have been good enough not to tell me how to do my job. I\u2019m not telling you how to do your job. But I\u2019m going to ask you some questions, and if you can\u2019t answer these questions, then I\u2019ll leave you to draw whatever conclusion you want to draw about whether or not the media has provided sufficient oversight.\n\nCan you tell me why Chris Stevens was in Benghazi the night that he was killed? Do you know? Does it bother you whether or not you know why Chris Stevens was in Benghazi? Do you know why we were the last flag flying in Benghazi after the British had left and the Red Cross had been bombed? Do you know why requests for additional security were denied? Do you know why an ambassador asking for more security days and weeks before he was murdered and those requests went unheeded? Do you know the answer to why those requests went unheeded? Do you know why no assets were deployed during the siege? And I\u2019ve heard the explanation \u2014 which defies logic, frankly \u2014 that we couldn\u2019t have gotten there in time, but you know, they didn\u2019t know when it was going to end. So how can you possibly cite that as an excuse? Do you know whether the president called any of our allies and said, \u201cCan you help? We have men under attack.\u201d Can you answer that? Do any of you know why Susan Rice was picked? The secretary of state did not go. She says she doesn\u2019t like Sunday talk shows. That\u2019s the only media venue she does not like, if that\u2019s true. Why was Susan Rice on the five Sunday talk shows? Do you know the origin of this mythology that it was spawned as a spontaneous reaction to a video? Do you know where that started? Do you know how we got from no evidence of that to that being the official position of the administration?\n\nIn conclusion, Congress is supposed to provide oversight, the voters are supposed to provide oversight, and you are supposed to provide oversight. That\u2019s why you have special liberties, and that\u2019s why you have special protections. I am not surprised that the president of the United States called this a phony scandal. I\u2019m not surprised Secretary Clinton asked, \u201cWhat difference does it make?\u201d I\u2019m not even surprised that Jay Carney said Benghazi happened a long time ago. I\u2019m just surprised at how many people bought it.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "\u201cI\u2019m just surprised at how many people bought it.\u201d", "title": "Reminder: When Gowdy threw down gauntlet to media on Benghazi questions", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2014/05/18/video-gowdy-throws-down-gauntlet-to-media-on-benghazi-questions/", "image": {"secure_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/V6kK7gAU0-A/0.jpg", "identifier": "http://img.youtube.com/vi/V6kK7gAU0-A/0.jpg"}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-05-18T15:01:56+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-05-18T15:29:45+00:00"}, "keywords": "Benghazi, media bias, select committee, Trey Gowdy,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd60ec\"", "article_summary": "I\u2019m not surprised Secretary Clinton asked, \u201cWhat difference does it make?\u201d I\u2019m not even surprised that Jay Carney said Benghazi happened a long time ago.\nThat\u2019s the only media venue she does not like, if that\u2019s true.\nDoes it bother you whether or not you know why Chris Stevens was in Benghazi?\nI am not surprised that the president of the United States called this a phony scandal.\nDo you know why we were the last flag flying in Benghazi after the British had left and the Red Cross had been bombed?"}
