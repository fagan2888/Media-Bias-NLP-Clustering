In a very funny sketch during last night's episode of Saturday Night Live on NBC, the show took on the growing trend of politically correct social media commentators who demand racial and gender diversity over all else. In a preview for a new CBS sitcom, the sketch showed a family called the Dudleys who change based on Twitter feedback.

Initially, the Dudleys are made up of a man and his wife with two young daughters. However, feedback causes the show to become centered on an interracial gay couple. Even that change isn't enough, as the Twitter comments immediately demand that the couple show "real intimacy" on television. Host Woody Harrelson, playing one of the gay men, then begins to simulate making out with the other gay character, played by Kenan Thompson.

One of the Dudley daughters is then changed from a ballerina into a Staff Sergeant in the United States Marine Corps, as a way to break gender stereotypes. The other daughter is transformed into the character Crazy Eyes from the Netflix show Orange is the New Black, featuring a cameo by the actual actress.

Once the sitcom had been fully crafted to meet the standards of the fans on Twitter, it was then reverted to the original format when a box of snail mail arrives that demands more white people on television. One funny letter includes the final tag: "P.S. Repeal Obamacare"

Woody Harrelson was hosting the show as part of a promotional tour for the latest installment of the "Hunger Games" film series. The sketch was easily one of the funniest of the evening, along with another about new football anti-concussion rules in which Harrelson played a coach.
