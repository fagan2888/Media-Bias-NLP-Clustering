Dennis Baxley of Ocala, Colleen Burton of Lakeland, Neil Combee of Polk County, Mike Hill of Pensacola, Larry Metz of Yalaha, Kathleen Peters of South Pasadena and John Wood of Winter Haven are all attending the conference, according to Wood\u2019s office. Rep. Mike LaRosa, R-St. Cloud, was also authorized by the House to attend but is not in California for the event.\n\nNo members of the Senate are confirmed to be attending the conference, including Sen. Kelli Stargel, R-Lakeland, who serves as ALEC\u2019s state co-chair in Florida alongside Wood.\n\nRepresentatives attending the conference have been given permission by the Speaker\u2019s office to use their taxpayer-funded member accounts for travel expenses. However, it\u2019s not clear whether any of them will choose to do so.\n\nWood said he hasn\u2019t yet decided if he\u2019ll pay for his travels with taxpayer dollars or leftover campaign funds. In past years, he\u2019s used campaign contributions.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a great policy exchange on a number of different issues that state legislators are facing across our nation,\u201d said Wood. \u201cThere\u2019s no real particular agenda other than the mission of ALEC is limited government, free markets and federalism. Those are my principles, and those are principles that we hope to apply to good public policy decisions.\u201d\n\nThe ALEC conference has been criticized, though, as a chance for corporate interest groups to influence state legislators behind closed doors. The national group\u2019s Private Enterprise Advisory Council includes representatives from AT&T, State Farm and Exxon Mobil, among other groups.\n\n\u201cAt ALEC\u2019s meeting, elected politicians and corporate representatives will meet behind closed doors to craft model bills, which often benefit the corporations\u2019 bottom line,\u201d wrote Peter Butzin of Common Cause, a liberal group, in a statement released this week.\n\nIn addition to hearing from conservative leaders \u2014 including Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, all candidates for president \u2014 ALEC task forces will discuss key policy agendas. Health care and energy issues will be among the most interesting and important, said Wood.\n\nThis will be ALEC\u2019s first meeting since the Florida House decided not to expand health coverage for Floridians using private insurers and federal Medicaid dollars. And it\u2019s the first since the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a critical provision of the Affordable Care Act in June.\n\n\u201cALEC has been pretty consistently against Medicaid expansion as a way to provide better health outcomes to our population, so I think the position we\u2019ve taken in the Florida House is consistent with their thinking,\u201d Wood said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Conservative legislators from around the country are flocking to San Diego this week for an annual gathering focused on states\u2019 rights, shrinking government and free-market policies.", "application-name": "Tampa Bay Times", "og": {"image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.tampabay.com/iwov-resources/images/og-default.png", "height": 600}, "site_name": "Tampa Bay Times", "description": "Conservative legislators from around the country are flocking to San Diego this week for an annual gathering focused on states\u2019 rights, shrinking government and free-market policies.", "title": "Seven members of Florida House attending conservative ALEC conference in San Diego"}, "twitter": {"site": "@TB_Times", "image": "http://www.tampabay.com/iwov-resources/images/og-default.png", "description": "Conservative legislators from around the country are flocking to San Diego this week for an annual gathering focused on states\u2019 rights, shrinking government and free-market policies.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Seven members of Florida House attending conservative ALEC conference"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#115220", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=988277045", "msapplication-TileImage": "/iwov-resources/images/ie10TBTpin.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Among the attendees at the annual meeting of the American Legislative Exchange Council, more commonly called ALEC, are seven members of the Florida House.\nThis will be ALEC\u2019s first meeting since the Florida House decided not to expand health coverage for Floridians using private insurers and federal Medicaid dollars.\nNo members of the Senate are confirmed to be attending the conference, including Sen.
