But that\u2019s what one man did after finally getting health insurance under the Affordable Care Act. The moving letter is going viral and making rounds on social media.\n\nIt\u2019s from a man named Brent Nathan Brown, addressed directly to the president, and reads as follows:\n\nTo My President,\n\nI sincerely hope that this reaches you, as far too often praise is hard to come by. Apologies to people who deserve it perhaps even less so.\n\nI did not vote for you. Either time. I have voted Republican for the entirety of my life.\n\nI proudly wore pins and planted banners displaying my Republican loyalty. I was very vocal in my opposition to you\u2013particularly the ACA.\n\nBefore I briefly explain my story allow me to first say this: I am so very sorry. I understand written content cannot convey emotions very well\u2013but my level of conviction has me in tears as I write this. I was so very wrong. So very very wrong.\n\nYou saved my life. I want that to sink into your ears and mind. My President, you saved my life, and I am eternally grateful.\n\nI have a \u2018pre-existing condition\u2019 and so could never purchase health insurance. Only after the ACA came into being could I be covered. Put simply to not take up too much of your time if you are in fact taking the time to read this: I would not be alive without access to care I received due to your law.\n\nSo thank you from a dumb young man who thought he knew it all and who said things about you that he now regrets. Thank you for serving me even when I didn\u2019t vote for you.\n\nThank you for being my President.\n\nHonored to have lived under your leadership and guidance,\n\nBrent Nathan Brown\n\nYou may also enjoy:\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nPinterest\n\nGoogle\n\nEmail\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "It's not often you'll hear a lifelong Republican say \"Thanks, Obama\" without the slightest hint of irony.
