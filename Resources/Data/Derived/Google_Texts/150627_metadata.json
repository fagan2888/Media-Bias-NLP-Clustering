That now leaves Community and HCA /quotes/zigman/1545475/delayed /quotes/nls/hca HCA as the nation\u2019s two-largest hospital chains.\n\nHCA and Community are just miles apart from each other; HCA is based near Vanderbilt University in Nashville, while Community is headquartered in the Nashville suburb of Franklin, 18 miles away. Nashville is a hub of sorts for health-care companies, many of which were spin-offs from venerable HCA or the creation of former officials of the hospital company.\n\nCommunity Health is one step removed from being a direct HCA spinoff. Its founders included two men who left HCA to join another health-care company before forming Community Health. HCA still appears to be the bigger company as it employs 204,000 people at 165 hospitals and 115 free-standing surgery centers in 20 states and England.\n\nCommunity Health now has more hospitals, 206, in more states, 29, to its name. But its employee count of 135,000 is well below that of HCA. Because of its surgery centers, HCA can count 280 facilities overall.\n\nCommunity announced in late July that it was buying Naples, Fla.-based Health Management for $3.8 billion. Health Management share holders will get $10.50 per share in cash and roughly 7% of a Community Health share for each Health Management share they own.\n\nAmid a down day in health care, shares of both Community and HCA were up. HCA added 1.5% to $49.10 while Community was up roughly 1% to $40.48.\n\nFollow Russ Britt on Twitter @russbrittmktw\n\nFollow Health Exchange on Twitter @MWHealthBlog\n\nMore health-care news from MarketWatch:\n\nGOP senators seek another Obamacare repeal, and offer alternative\n\nMerck hits new high as analyst sees opening for cancer drug\n\nAriad shares jump on rumor of takeover", "article_metadata": {"article.author": "Russ Britt", "description": "Two leaders in hospital operations formalize their merger, putting Community Health Systems atop the heap along with HCA Holdings Inc.", "application-name": "MarketWatch.com", "article.page": "Health Exchange Blog", "og": {"site_name": "Marketwatch", "description": "Two leaders in hospital operations formalize their merger, putting Community Health Systems atop the heap along with HCA Holdings Inc.", "title": "With Community Health deal done, two hospital firms are tied for largest", "url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2014/01/27/with-community-health-deal-done-two-hospital-firms-now-at-top-of-heap/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/MWimages/MW-DR328_mw_soc_NS_20150801233302.png", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Marketwatch.com", "description": "Two leaders in hospital operations formalize their merger, putting Community Health Systems atop the heap along with HCA Holdings Inc.", "title": "With Community Health deal done, two hospital firms are tied for largest", "url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2014/01/27/with-community-health-deal-done-two-hospital-firms-now-at-top-of-heap/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/MWimages/MW-BT412_hospit_ME_20140127170238.jpg"}, "site": "MarketWatch", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.published": "2014-01-27T16:58:00-05:00", "article.access": "free", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "msapplication-tooltip": "MarketWatch", "article.type": "Health Exchange", "article.id": "BL-MW243B-1935", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2014/01/27/with-community-health-deal-done-two-hospital-firms-now-at-top-of-heap/", "app_id": 283204329838}, "article.created": "2014-01-27T16:58:00-05:00", "author": "Russ Britt", "article.updated": "2014-01-27T17:05:29-05:00", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch", "image_count": 2}, "article.section": "Markets", "article.headline": "With Community Health deal done, two hospital firms are tied for largest", "msapplication-task": "name=SmartMoney;action-uri=http://www.smartmoney.com/;icon-uri=http://www.smartmoney.com/favicon.ico"}, "article_summary": "Health Management share holders will get $10.50 per share in cash and roughly 7% of a Community Health share for each Health Management share they own.\nCommunity Health now has more hospitals, 206, in more states, 29, to its name.\nIts founders included two men who left HCA to join another health-care company before forming Community Health.\nCommunity announced in late July that it was buying Naples, Fla.-based Health Management for $3.8 billion.\nCommunity Health is one step removed from being a direct HCA spinoff."}
