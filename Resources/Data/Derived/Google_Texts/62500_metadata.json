(Photo: Courtesy of the Matheny School) Story Highlights Joshua wanted to communicate and had been frustrated by his limited ability to do so\n\nPositive forms of communication includes PECS (Picture Exchange Communication Systems)\n\nWhen 3-year-old Joshua Rincon arrived at The Matheny School in August 2013, it was clear to his teacher, Dawn Williams, that \"he wanted to communicate and had been frustrated by his limited ability to do so.\"\n\nThe key to unlocking Josh's communication, said Williams, has been \"encouraging him to use a variety of positive forms of communication including PECS (Picture Exchange Communication Systems), real pictures and objects, voice output switches and, perhaps the most successful of all, using his pointer finger to make choices.\"\n\nJoshua's father, Jairo Rincon, a Hillsborough resident, said improved communication has been one of his son's major achievements since coming to Matheny.\n\n\"His communication,\" Rincon said, \"has improved so he can let us know his needs and preferences. He has learned how to use his utensils, and he is also able to play and entertain himself. And his behavior has improved.\"\n\nJoshua Rincon with Dawn Williams during a visit to the Peapack-Gladstone Firehouse.

The Hillsborough School District, Rincon said, was supportive.\n\nMatheny is the correct environment for Josh, Rincon believes, because of the level of attention and interaction that is required. And, \"the IEP (Individualized Education Program) is followed more aggressively.\" The teachers and therapists at Matheny, Rincon, said, are \"excellent. Their level of expertise is very high. They are always bringing new ideas about Joshua's education and his physical progress.\"\n\nWilliams points out that Joshua has become more independent and adept at daily living skills such as self-feeding, which, she adds, \"is great because he loves to eat! He is also very proud when he is successful using his custom toileting chair.\" Rincon said he and his wife, Grecia, often refer to Williams as \"his second mom. She is so caring and loving. We are so glad she is our son's teacher and his caregiver.\"\n\nThe Matheny School is part of the Matheny Medical and Educational Center, a special hospital and educational facility for children and adults with medically complex developmental disabilities.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://mycj.co/1GiejEH", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Matheny School helps unlock communications barriers for special needs student from Hillsborough", "og": {"site_name": "MY CENTRAL JERSEY", "description": "Matheny School helps unlock communications barriers for special needs student from Hillsborough", "title": "Matheny School helps special-needs student", "url": "http://www.mycentraljersey.com/story/news/local/somerset-county/2015/04/21/matheny-school-helps-student/26139797/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/mycentraljersey.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Matheny School helps unlock communications barriers for special needs student from Hillsborough", "title": "Matheny School helps special-needs student", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e35008e3886b772d2b2ba37f7b18d7aa050b7b31/c=17-0-1496-1479&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Bridgewater/2015/04/21/B9317005518Z.1_20150421164810_000_GFFAH8JN8.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@MyCentralJersey", "site": "@MyCentralJersey", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=859380356", "fb": {"app_id": 177893718898560}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "Matheny School, cerebral palsy, communication, special needs"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd4f1\"", "article_summary": "The Matheny School is part of the Matheny Medical and Educational Center, a special hospital and educational facility for children and adults with medically complex developmental disabilities.\n\"His communication,\" Rincon said, \"has improved so he can let us know his needs and preferences.\nThe teachers and therapists at Matheny, Rincon, said, are \"excellent.\nJoshua received early intervention through the Arc of Somerset County's Jerry Davis School, and his social worker recommended Matheny.\nJoshua Rincon with his family at Matheny\u2019s annual picnic."}
