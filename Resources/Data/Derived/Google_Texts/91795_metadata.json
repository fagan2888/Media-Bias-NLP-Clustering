Between the age of the main and water flowing through there, one of the joints broke down.\u201d\n\nA temporary patch now covers the street where the main broke. \u201cThis week our paving contractor will go in and do a permanent repair,\u201d Thompson said.\n\nThe game between the Rockies and the Cincinnati Reds, originally scheduled for Saturday night, was played at 7:10 p.m. Sunday as the second game of a split doubleheader.\n\nThe Denver Office of Emergency Management requested the Saturday game be postponed at about 6:50 p.m., about 40 minutes after the scheduled start time. The water main break at 20th and Blake cut off the water supply to the ballpark.\n\nThe 12-inch main served only Coors Field, and no other businesses in the area lost water pressure.\n\nSaturday\u2019s game was scheduled for 6:10 p.m., but at about 5:55 p.m. the Rockies announced the game would be delayed because of the water problem. At about 6:45 p.m., the Rockies announced that the game was being moved to Sunday night.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Rockies fans returning to Coors after water main break closes stadium", "title": "Rockies fans returning to Coors after water main break closes stadium", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/08/17/rockies-fans-returning-to-coors-after-water-main-break-closes-stadium/", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140816__watermainp1-2.jpg", "height": 480}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140816__watermainp1-2.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-17T12:24:11+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T10:28:35+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf491\"", "article_summary": "The water main break at 20th and Blake cut off the water supply to the ballpark.\nAfter being washed out by a water main break on Saturday, baseball resumed at Coors Field on Sunday after crews worked late into the night to repair the break.\n\u201cThis week our paving contractor will go in and do a permanent repair,\u201d Thompson said.\nIt isn\u2019t clear what caused the break, which workers had repaired by 12:30 a.m., said Travis Thompson, spokesman for Denver Water.\nThe 12-inch main served only Coors Field, and no other businesses in the area lost water pressure."}
