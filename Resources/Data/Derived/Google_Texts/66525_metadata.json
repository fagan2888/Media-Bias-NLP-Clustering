Axford had been on the family medical emergency list, but that move expired Sunday.\n\n\u201cIt gives us a little bit more time is all,\u201d Rockies manager Walt Weiss said. \u201cIt\u2019s a day-to-day situation.\u201d\n\nAxford remains in Denver where his son, Jameson, underwent surgery last week to fight an infection in his right foot. Jameson was bit twice by a rattlesnake last month in the backyard of a rental house near Scottsdale, Ariz.\n\nHe was moved to Denver from a Phoenix-area hospital by medical emergency flight to be closer to a plastic surgery specialist. And Jameson on Friday left the intensive care unit for the first time.\n\nAxford, who pitched in the Rockies\u2019 season-opening series at Milwaukee before leaving the team, has been keeping game-ready while in Denver, Weiss said.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been staying in shape and throwing, keeping his arm in shape,\u201d Weiss said.\n\nScott Oberg was called up from Triple-A Albuquerque to replace Axford in the Rockies\u2019 bullpen. He made his major-league debut last week at San Francisco.\n\nRoster move coming. The Rockies will need to make room on their 25-man roster for Jorge De La Rosa\u2019s return to the rotation Monday. That likely means Christian Bergman will be optioned.\n\nBergman, who was on the opening-day roster for the first time, started a game in San Francisco last week and was available in the bullpen Saturday and Sunday in L.A.\n\nWeiss said he has not yet decided on the roster move. \u201cWe\u2019ll wait as long as we need to on that one,\u201d he said.\n\nAnderson in a good place in L.A. Dodgers starter Brett Anderson, who left Colorado after last season after the Rockies declined his contract option, said he\u2019s doing much better with his new team. He\u2019s healthy and, after Hyun-jin Ryu went down with a shoulder injury, Anderson moved into the No. 4 spot in the Dodgers\u2019 rotation.\n\n\u201cEven if you pitch bad, it\u2019s still better than being on the side,\u201d Anderson said. He pitched just eight games for the Rockies in 2014 after a broken finger and a bulging disc in his back sidelined him.\n\n\u201cIt was tough, but you can\u2019t feel sorry for yourself,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cI still get to come to the field. I\u2019m a baseball rat.\u201d\n\nAnderson is 1-0 with a 3.27 ERA in two starts for L.A. He\u2019ll pitch Monday at San Francisco.\n\nNick Groke: ngroke@denverpost.com or twitter.com/nickgroke", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "John Axford moved to Rockies\u2019 restricted list while caring for his son in Denver", "title": "John Axford moved to Rockies\u2019 restricted list while caring for his son in Denver", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/04/19/john-axford-moved-to-rockies-restricted-list-while-caring-for-his-son-in-denver/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150419__axfordp1.jpg", "height": 481}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150419__axfordp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-19T13:20:14+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-25T03:58:25+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf273\"", "article_summary": "The Rockies on Sunday placed Axford on the restricted list, a roster move that allows them to bring the right-hander back on a day\u2019s notice.\nLOS ANGELES \u2014 Rockies relief pitcher John Axford will continue his leave from the team so he can care for his 2-year-old son after a rattlesnake bite.\nAxford, who pitched in the Rockies\u2019 season-opening series at Milwaukee before leaving the team, has been keeping game-ready while in Denver, Weiss said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a day-to-day situation.\u201dAxford remains in Denver where his son, Jameson, underwent surgery last week to fight an infection in his right foot.\nHe was moved to Denver from a Phoenix-area hospital by medical emergency flight to be closer to a plastic surgery specialist."}
