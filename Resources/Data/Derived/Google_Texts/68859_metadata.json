Nothing attempted by his predecessor, George W. Bush, remotely compares in imperial hubris. Mr. Bush gained explicit congressional consent for his invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq. In contrast, the Obama administration has not even published a legal opinion attempting to justify the president\u2019s assertion of unilateral war-making authority. This is because no serious opinion can be written.\n\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsor This became clear when White House officials briefed reporters before Mr. Obama\u2019s speech to the nation on Wednesday evening. They said a war against ISIS was justified by Congress\u2019s authorization of force against Al Qaeda after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, and that no new approval was needed. But the 2001 authorization for the use of military force does not apply here. That resolution \u2014 scaled back from what Mr. Bush initially wanted \u2014 extended only to nations and organizations that \u201cplanned, authorized, committed or aided\u201d the 9/11 attacks.\n\nAnd Ackerman\u2019s not alone.\n\nRobert Chesney, a professor at the University of Texas School of Law, told the Daily Beast this week that Obama\u2019s claim of authority to bomb ISIS targets in Syria was \u201con its face\u201d an \u201cimplausible argument.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe 2001 AUMF requires a nexus to al Qaeda or associated forces of al Qaeda fighting the United States,\u201d explained Chesney, but \u201csince ISIS broke up with al Qaeda it\u2019s hard to make\u201d the case that authority granted by the AUMF still applies.\n\nAnd as The Nation magazine\u2019s Zo\u00eb Carpenter reports:\n\nThe White House\u2019s dismissal of the need for congressional approval is also in conflict with positions Obama himself expressed as a presidential candidate. \u201cThe President does not have power under the Constitution to unilaterally authorize a military attack in a situation that does not involve stopping an actual or imminent threat to the nation,\u201d Obama declared to The Boston Globe in 2008. The situation in Iraq and Syria does not appear to meet that standard. Obama acknowledged on Wednesday that \u201c[w]e have not yet detected specific plotting against our homeland.\u201d Meanwhile, intelligence sources say that the threat from ISIS has been grossly exaggerated. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine a better indication of the ability of elected officials and TV talking heads to spin the public into a panic, with claims that the nation is honeycombed with sleeper cells, that operatives are streaming across the border into Texas or that the group will soon be spraying Ebola virus on mass transit systems\u2014all on the basis of no corroborated information,\u201d former State Department counterterrorism adviser Daniel Benjamin told The New York Times.\n\nAccording to Ackerman, the president has put himself in a perilous position.\n\n\u201cThe president seems grimly determined to practice what Mr. Bush\u2019s lawyers only preached,\u201d the Yale professor concludes in his op-ed. \u201cHe is acting on the proposition that the president, in his capacity as commander in chief, has unilateral authority to declare war. In taking this step, Mr. Obama is not only betraying the electoral majorities who twice voted him into office on his promise to end Bush-era abuses of executive authority. He is also betraying the Constitution he swore to uphold.\u201d\n\nAnd Carpenter says that in addition to defying Congress and his constitutional obligations, Obama should also be worried about the implications for his new strategy under international law. She writes:\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that the legality of an extended cross-border campaign isn\u2019t only a question of the separation of powers. As Eli Lake noted at The Daily Beast, the White House has not explained the basis for the strikes under international law. While the administration\u2019s current attempt to circumnavigate Congress is hypocritical as well as potentially illegal, it\u2019s also consistent with the way Obama has exercised US military power before. As Spencer Ackerman notes, he\u2019s extended drone strikes across the Middle East and North Africa; initiated a seven-month air campaign in Libya without congressional approval; prolonged the war in Afghanistan; and, in recent months, ordered more than 1,000 troops back into Iraq. Promises of no boots on the ground notwithstanding, Obama\u2019s war footprint is large, and expanding.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Following his announcement to bomb Syria without congressional approval, president slammed for total disregard for constitutional safeguards regarding war-making.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "Jon Queally | Common Dreams", "og": {"site_name": "MintPress News", "description": "Following his announcement to bomb Syria without congressional approval, president slammed for total disregard for constitutional safeguards regarding war-making.", "title": "Obama Charged With 'Imperial Hubris' Unmatched Even By Bush", "url": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/obama-charged-imperial-hubris-unmatched-even-bush/196515/", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Netherlands-Nuclear-S_Muha11.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-09-12T15:56:22-05:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Following his announcement to bomb Syria without congressional approval, president slammed for total disregard for constitutional safeguards regarding war-making.", "creator": "@jonqueally", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Netherlands-Nuclear-S_Muha11.jpg", "title": "Obama Charged With 'Imperial Hubris' Unmatched Even By Bush", "site": "@MintPressNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100003161352196}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MintpressNewsMPN", "section": "Daily Digest", "tag": "War", "published_time": "2014-09-13T05:00:15-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-09-12T15:56:22-05:00"}}, "article_summary": "Obama Charged With \u2018Imperial Hubris\u2019 Unmatched Even By BushFollowing his announcement to bomb Syria without congressional approval, president slammed for total disregard for constitutional safeguards regarding war-making.\nPromises of no boots on the ground notwithstanding, Obama\u2019s war footprint is large, and expanding.\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsor This became clear when White House officials briefed reporters before Mr. Obama\u2019s speech to the nation on Wednesday evening.\nNothing attempted by his predecessor, George W.
