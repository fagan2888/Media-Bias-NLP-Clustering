A weekend break-in at Taft Middle School resulted in at least $10 thousand worth in computer thefts. But how Taft's principal handled it raised a few eyebrows.

An Oklahoma City police report written Monday morning said Taft Principal Helen Johnson didn't care that her school had been broken into. “She was not concerned with the theft or any sort of damage,” the report read. “She really took the tone with me that she could not be bothered with this.”

School District Spokesperson Tierney Tinnin says that's not what really happened. “At the end of the day, it was one o'clock in the morning and what was said and what was perceived is not the way it was supposed to be. I can tell you she values taxpayer dollars. She's a wonderful person and competent leader,” she said.

Tinnin said the school district has systems in place that handle these kinds of things. And school principals aren't necessarily a part of how the District responds.
