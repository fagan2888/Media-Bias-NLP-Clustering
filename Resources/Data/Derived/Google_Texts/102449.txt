The Melville Police Department will host its annual Easter Fair Thursday through Saturday with carnival rides for the entire family. The town also will honor the champion Lady Hurricanes basketball team with a parade Saturday morning.

Cyndi Rowe with the police department said the fair on the grounds of the Melville Civic Center, 1105 First St., will serve as a fundraiser for the struggling police department.

“We need it. We are making it, but it’s rough,” Rowe said. The city began this year with a new administration and a mountain of debt.

As a result, the town on the Atchafalaya River in northern St. Landry Parish is only able to operate one police car. Money it raises during the event will purchase badly needed equipment and, officials hope, get more police vehicles on Melville streets.

Rowe said this is the eighth year for the festival.

The main attraction will be carnival rides by Jim’s Rides. People may save a bit of money by purchasing their armbands in advance.

Rowe said the armbands are $12 in advance and $15 at the fair. They can be bought in advance at the police department, located in the City Hall complex at 516 Church St.

Each armband allows unlimited rides, but each is good for only one day. People who want to ride all three days of the fair will need three armbands.

“We will have rides for younger children as well as riders for older children and adults,” Rowe said.

The fair will be open from 3 to 10 p.m. each day, through Saturday will start earlier because of the parade.

That parade honors North Central High School’s women’s basketball team that recently won the 2015 LHSAA Class 1A State Championship.

“We are celebrating our own Jazlyn Robertson, who was named MVP,” said Alderwoman Caretta Robertson, who has the honor of being Jazlyn’s aunt.

“It should be a nice parade,” said Robertson, who said several Melville families plan to host homecomings that weekend.

The parade will form up on the fair grounds at 10 a.m. on Saturday and will march out at 11 a.m.

It will then parade through town and return to the fair grounds.

Robertson said individuals, groups and organizations are encouraged to participate “There is no fee. We want everyone to join us in celebrating St. Landry Parish’s state champs,” Robertson said.
