NEW YORK (MainStreet) — Joel Rasmussen has been renting short-term vacation rentals in Austin for more than seven years, hosting 52 weeks per year for tourists visiting the popular Texas city where festivals such as South by Southwest and Austin City Limits take place.

“Our properties are in the South Congress area,” Rasmussen told MainStreet. “Soco Spaces is a major draw for visitors to Austin.”

But as the sharing economy rises in popularity -- with 4 million consumers who used Airbnb alone -- so too does the liability, and the standard insurance offered on Airbnb and similar accommodations websites, like VRBO.com and Homeaway.com, are not sufficient to cover hosts like Rasmussen.

Like many who rent out their properties through sharing services, Rasmussen is focused on generating income. But he's also prudent about making sure he's covering his back, given the sharing economy horror stories out there from unruly guests.

Festival lodging in Austin can run $500 to $600 per night. As a result, loss of rent is significant for Rasmussen, who advertises his vacation rentals on HomeAway.com and maintains insurance called Assure through HomeAway, which includes a million-dollar commercial liability policy.

“Loss of income is my first and foremost concern but also just having coverage that specifically permits and covers short term rental as an allowed use,” said Rasmussen.
