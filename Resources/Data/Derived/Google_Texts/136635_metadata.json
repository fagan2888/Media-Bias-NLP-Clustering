Ted Cruz (R-TX) got an earful outside an Indiana ice cream shop on Tuesday from a Trump supporter who accused him of being the \"establishment candidate.\u201d\n\nIn video captured by ABC News, Kathy Hiel grilled Cruz about the delegate selection process and his votes in the Senate. Using language reminiscent of GOP frontrunner Donald Trump, Hiel accused the Texas senator of benefiting from a rigged system that allows candidates to court and win delegates regardless of the outcome of a state\u2019s popular vote.\n\n\u201cHow can you have delegates without a vote?\u201d Hiel asked Cruz.\n\n\u201cEvery state sets up different rules,\u201d Cruz replied. \u201cI don\u2019t control the rules, but I can tell you the Washington establishments who I\u2019ve been fighting against every day, whether in leading the fight against Obamacare or leading the fight against amnesty, I\u2019m the one who has led the fight. Donald Trump is the one who funded the Gang of 8 that pushed for amnesty.\u201d\n\n\u201c$15,000 over 4 years isn\u2019t funding much of anything,\u201d Hiel shot back.\n\n\u201cWell I gave zero dollars to them and I led the fight against it,\" Cruz countered. \"Donald Trump in 2013 was tweeting out his support for amnesty.\"\n\n\u201cYou led the fight in favor of auditing the Fed and didn\u2019t show to vote. You led the fight against TPP but yet voted in favor of it,\u201d Hiel said.\n\n\u201cMa\u2019am, I\u2019ll have a respectful conversation with you but not\u2014\" a frustrated Cruz interjected.\n\n\u201cThat is my respect,\u201d Hiel said. \u201cI\u2019m asking you. You fight on the wrong end.\u201d\n\nCruz has built his name on lashing out at what he often calls the \u201cWashington cartel\u201d and staging high-profile stunts like reading Dr. Seuss\u2019 \u201cGreen Eggs and Ham\u201d on the Senate floor during a 21-hour-long push to defund Obamacare. Still, Trump, who has never worked in politics, has had success framing Cruz as a D.C. player who engaged in \u201cdirty tricks\u201d to remain competitive in the 2016 race. A pact forged this week between Cruz and Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R) to try to defeat Trump in key primary states, including Indiana, added fuel to that narrative.\n\nAccording to ABC News, Hiel admitted at the end of her back-and-forth with Cruz that she was a Trump supporter and didn\u2019t believe the Texas senator was a natural-born citizen because he was born in Canada.\n\n\u201cWith the collusion of Ted and the Republican Party and John Kasich I feel that they should\u2014both men should just step out,\u201d Hiel said. \u201cThey\u2019re just doing nothing but trying to hurt the front-runner when they actually don't have a chance of winning.\u201d\n\nWatch Heil's exchange with Cruz below:", "article_metadata": {"p": {"domain_verify": "da088b457e7d0e91a9f692968f1043c1"}, "og": {"site_name": "Talking Points Memo", "description": "Sen.
