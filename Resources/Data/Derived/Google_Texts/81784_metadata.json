Exhibit A will forever be Donald Trump, but Chris Christie makes a strong Exhibit B.\n\nChristie is rising. He\u2019s doubled his support in New Hampshire since early November, climbing to third or fourth in the latest Granite State polls, and is said to be rising in the race to be an \u201cestablishment\u201d alternative to the likes of Trump and Ted Cruz.\n\nIn part, Christie\u2019s current \u201cmoment\u201d reflects a masterful ability to sound pugnaciously conservative despite a mixed political record. In the debates, he demonstrates his natural gifts as a communicator, staring directly at the camera and speaking straightforwardly to viewers in their living rooms. He repeats the same anecdotes, jokes, and talking points with such fluidity that the average voter wouldn\u2019t know he\u2019s used them 1,000 times before. He bristles with impatience at arguments between his rivals, sneering with boredom, and mocks their minute disagreements as \u201cendless debate about how many angels fit on the head of a pin.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a schtick \u2014 the man of action in a sea of talkers, the Mr. Fix-It among the ineffectual wonks \u2014 that must be appealing to the kind of voter who likes Trump\u2019s style but wishes it was backed up by even a shred of substance. And while it bodes ill for productive political discourse, it obviously works for Christie, because he\u2019s kept at it. And it has the tangential benefit of masking what is at best a spotty history of conservative policymaking.\n\nRELATED: There\u2019s No Denying Chris Christie Is a Serious Political Talent\n\nSteven Malanga\u2019s detailed review of Christie\u2019s record as governor shows some distinct conservative victories: vetoing tax hikes, cutting the spending increases enacted by his Democratic predecessor Jon Corzine, enacting a 2 percent cap on annual property-tax increases, and moving the ball in the right direction on pension reform for state employees, one of the most intractable problems in New Jersey politics.\n\nBut Malanga\u2019s overarching portrait is of a governor who took on a juggernaut of wildly irresponsible tax-and-spend Democratic state legislators and ended up settling for modest, probably insufficient reforms. And his broader record of flip-flopping on conservative priorities is troubling.\n\nHe may not be a consistent conservative, but he does a really convincing job of playing one on TV.\n\nChristie chose to not join other states in the lawsuit against Obamacare. As a presidential candidate, he opposes the expansion of Medicaid nationally, but he agreed to expand the program in New Jersey under the president\u2019s signature health-care law, with the caveat that the expansion would be rescinded if the federal government broke its funding promises. In the November debate, Christie bizarrely claimed that, \u201cWe stopped Obamacare in New Jersey because we refused to participate in the federal exchange .\u201d But New Jersey does participate in the federal exchange; it didn\u2019t set up its own state exchange.\n\nFew Republicans tear into teachers\u2019 unions with such relish; he\u2019s called the American Federation of Teachers the \u201csingle most destructive force in public education in America\u201d and suggested they need \u201ca punch in the face.\u201d But as governor, Christie accepted the Obama administration\u2019s Common Core standards, explaining that \u201cwe signed on to try to get funds during a really difficult fiscal time.\u201d Before the audience of CPAC in 2015, he said he regretted how the standards had been implemented.\n\nChristie describes himself as a rare beast: a pro-life Republican governor from the Northeast who vetoed state funding for Planned Parenthood and earned praise from New Jersey Right to Life. But earlier in his political career, in a 1994 race, he painted himself as pro-choice and said he personally donated to Planned Parenthood.\n\nAnd just this week, Christie told Sean Hannity he\u2019s changed his mind on guns. This is a man who once declared that he does not believe New Jersey citizens should be permitted to own a licensed weapon just because they want one. Not long ago, NR\u2019s Charles C. W. Cooke described the New Jersey governor\u2019s record on the Second Amendment as \u201c execrable .\u201d\n\nThese opportunistic shifts may not matter, of course. The final weeks before the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary could make GOP voters reassess the candidates with a new level of scrutiny and seriousness. But it could also turn out that style matters more than substance in the post-Obama political landscape. Christie is no doubt banking on the latter possibility: He may not be a consistent conservative, but he does a really convincing job of playing one on TV.\n\n\u2014 Jim Geraghty is the senior political correspondent for National Review.", "article_metadata": {"tweettext": "Chris Christie may not be a consistent conservative, but he does a really convincing job of playing one on TV.", "sailthru.author": "Jim Geraghty", "description": "Chris Christie may not be a consistent conservative, but he does a really convincing job of playing one on TV.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "title": "Chris Christie 2016 -- Republican Candidate?
