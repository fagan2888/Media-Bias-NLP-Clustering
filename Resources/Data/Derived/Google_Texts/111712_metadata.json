Carl Levin (D-MI), a Democrat, has held since 1979.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nTerri Lynn Land, Michigan\u2019s ex-Secretary of State and a Republican National Committeewoman, is running her U.S. Senate campaign on an aggressive conservative populist message that seems more fit for red state Republicans than a Republican running in a bluish-purple state like Michigan.\n\nA national mood against President Barack Obama is hurting Democrats, especially those who don\u2019t have the luxury of incumbency like Land\u2019s opponent Rep. Gary Peters (D-MI). Package all that together with a series of mishaps Peters and his campaign have made so far, and it puts Land in striking distance two months from election day.\n\nThe biggest slip-up by Peters in Michigan\u2013for which he still hasn\u2019t provided an answer\u2013is that he told a group that \u201cimmigration reform is not about enforcement.\u201d There is also how Peters claims he is against outsourcing American jobs but actually engaged in the process as Michigan\u2019s lottery chief. Acccording to the Washington Free Beacon, he\u2019s been rolling in the dough, making thousands\u2013potentially more\u2013in profits off of outsourcing by an investment property of his.\n\nIf that wasn\u2019t bad enough, Peters has claimed he\u2019s for equal pay for women and men in the U.S. job market but only pays women in his U.S. House office 67 cents for every dollar paid to men who work for him, according to a recent National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) hit on Peters.\n\nLand told Breitbart News in a phone interview:\n\nStarting right out with immigration, he tells one group it\u2019s important to secure the border but another group that it\u2019s not about enforcement. So it\u2019s nice to talk about it but where does he stand? And then as far as equal pay, when you\u2019re not paying the women in your own office the same as the men\u2013and it\u2019s 67 cents on the dollar\u2013that\u2019s not the place you should be. When I was Secretary of State, we actually created programs where men and women could learn skills for management so that when they were ready they could apply for management jobs and move up the ladder as far as pay and responsibilities and that\u2019s what you want to do in your job. We actually did it\u2013by the time I left the Secretary of State\u2019s office, we had more women managers than when I started with a program that definitely worked. As far as outsourcing, he claims he\u2019s against that but yet did that when he was the lotto director and then also through the stimulus bill outsourced to foreign countries for car manufacturing. We build the best cars in America, and Detroit put America on wheels\u2013and we do the best here in Michigan.\n\nThe theme of Land\u2019s campaign is \u201cMichigan First,\u201d something she said in an interview means that she believes the role of government is to enact policies that help ordinary Americans\u2013in her case, Michiganders\u2013succeed economically. Land told Breitbart News:\n\nWhat we\u2019re talking about with Michigan First is jobs and the economy. Michigan has been through some tough times here and we need to make sure we have some good-paying jobs here in Michigan, and in order to do that we need to have a tax structure that\u2019s fair, simpler and lower. I went out and visited with businesses across this state\u2013manufacturers, retailers\u2013and they basically say they need stability. We need to know what the tax code is going to be, we need to know what the regulations are so we can invest in capital and grow our businesses so we have good-paying jobs.\n\nIt may sound like House Budget Committee chairman Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI)\u2013and his out-of-touch 2012 vice presidential campaign rhetoric of \u201cjob creators\u201d that has since translated into his support for comprehensive immigration reform and amnesty for illegal aliens\u2013all over again, but it\u2019s not. There\u2019s a key distinction here. The Washington establishment of the Republican Party has been focused for years on helping business owners\u2013industry\u2019s elite players, a small group of wealthy but influential commercial titans. What Land is talking about is helping everyday workers, the people who vote in elections in America. And what she\u2019s doing is no accident: It\u2019s a coordinated message across her press strategy and policy strategy, and it\u2019s tapping into a national discontent with Washington, D.C.\n\nLand has offered a series of \u201cMichigan First\u201d plans on issues like immigration, transportation, and trade policy. Her transportation, or her \u201cRoads, Bridges and Highways Michigan First\u201d plan calls for a series of policy reforms that return power on infrastructure rebuilding back to the states and away from Washington, D.C., and her \u201cMichigan First\u201d trade policy isn\u2019t a traditional \u201cfree trade\u201d deal\u2013it calls for restrictions on outsourcing of American jobs to foreign countries so those jobs stay in the U.S. rather than go to increasingly globalized corporations around the world.\n\nLand\u2019s immigration plan, perhaps the most interesting of them all, focuses on how America\u2019s \u201cbroken border with Mexico has cost Michigan jobs,\u201d honing in on the drastically negative economic effects of open borders policies on struggling Americans. It calls for tough interior and border enforcement, so that illegal aliens aren\u2019t getting jobs that Michigan\u2019s citizens and legal immigrants could be doing, and for blocking any amnesty for illegal aliens.\n\nAnd while the immigration plan is far from perfect\u2013it does call for an increase in H1B high-tech visas in response to a supposed \u201cshortage\u201d of high-tech workers in the U.S. that experts like Robert Charette have argued in IEEE Spectrum magazine is based on false data-it does focus on low-skilled workers, on getting Americans back to work rather than helping illegal aliens.\n\nThis is impressive for a Republican running in a state like Michigan. It allows Land to say she\u2019s pro-immigration reform, but only in support of reforms that are positive for the country and for Michigan\u2013those that put \u201cMichigan First\u201d\u2013rather than the Democrats being able to paint her into a \u201cparty of no\u201d box they\u2019ve been trying to do with Republicans nationally for a long time.\n\nLand told Breitbart News:\n\nWe need to reform our immigration system\u2013it\u2019s too complex for folks that want to do it legally. It\u2019s too challenging. We need to make it so folks can go through the process to come here legally. Second, I\u2019m a mom\u2013and these children who have come across the border, we need to get them back to their parents. That should be a priority, and we need to do that. With the border, we need to secure the border and make sure people can\u2019t come here illegally\u2013and then with all three of those, it will make the system work and work for our great country.\n\nMichigan\u2019s 2014 U.S. Senate race offers Republicans a chance to test out new, voter-focused messages aimed at detailing how liberal policies of the Democrats are hurting everyday people\u2013rather than just the messages of the past few years of how the Democrats\u2019 policies are hurting wealthy businessmen. It lets Land say she\u2019s not anti-government, but in favor of making government serve the needs of her constituents rather than serve the needs of special interests and big-time donors.\n\n\u201cAs Secretary of State, it was all about customer service. We reduced the operation and reduced cost but delivered more services and were able to deliver a lot of them online,\u201d she said. \u201cWe actually made government work for the people\u2013that\u2019s my background of eight years, and I actually believe we can bring that to the federal government, make it work for the people. From that, that should be our priority.\u201d\n\nThat kind of logic applies especially to the Detroit bankruptcy situation. Liberal Democratic and big government policies sank Detroit to an all-time low, making it perhaps the biggest U.S. city to be forced into declaring bankruptcy. But it\u2019s practical policies from Republicans, Land says, that will pull it back from the flames and burst it back to life. According to Land:\n\nThe good news is we have Gov. Snyder, who\u2019s working very hard with the emergency manager Kevyn Orr to get that on the right track. They\u2019ve got a great plan\u2013the folks in Detroit and across Michigan have been very supportive of that. They\u2019ve got nonprofits and the autos who have contributed to the legacy cost of the pensions of employees with the city of Detroit. As I mentioned, Detroit put America on wheels, and they need to get the support they need to do that again. The good news is the pensioners came together on the plan and supported it, and we need everyone to come together and make sure Detroit is successful. We need Detroit to be successful for Michigan to be successful.\n\nWhat Land\u2019s doing is working: She\u2019s polling neck-and-neck with Peters, and the liberal leftwing billionaire hedge fund manager Tom Steyer\u2013an architect behind funding a \u201cclimate change\u201d battle in Congress\u2013has dumped millions into Michigan to attack Land.\n\n\u201cWith Gary Peters slipping in the polls, national Democrats are spending over $1.8 million on the Michigan U.S. Senate race this week, and Steyer is committed to $2.6 million over the next 3 weeks, almost exclusively on ads attacking Terri Lynn Land,\u201d Joe Kildea, a Land campaign adviser, said in an email.\n\nLand is a few points back, according to the Real Clear Politics polling average, but she\u2019s stayed within a few points of Peters in most major polls\u2013even taking some leads\u2013since the end of 2013. A break or two for Land may blow this race, which most prognosticators are considering a toss-up, wide open. If she pulls that off, it would mean a Republican won in a blue state using a conservative populist message, yet again emboldening the cause of grassroots conservatives on a national level.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A perfect storm is brewing in Michigan that may propel a Republican into the U.S. Senate seat Sen.
