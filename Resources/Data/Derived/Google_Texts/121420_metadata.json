The findings reveal:\n\nEighty-five percent of hospitals reported strong or total commitment to population health or have population health in their vision statements.\n\nHospitals are almost as likely to consider their \"population\" to be the patients that use their health system (70 percent) or their geographic service area (69 percent).\n\nMore than 90 percent of hospitals agreed or strongly agreed that population health was aligned with their mission. However, only 19 percent of those hospitals strongly agreed that they had the financial resources available for population health while less than 20 percent strongly agreed that their hospital has programs to address socioeconomic determinants of health.\n\nThe survey also found the most common partnerships with community organizations were with public health departments, chambers of commerce, health insurance companies and community clinics.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- download the survey results (.pdf)\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nThe future of population health management\n\n3 strategies to drive population health\n\nAscension CEO Tony tersigni on culture change and population health strategies\n\nWhy the next generation of nurses must look at social determinants of health\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "The push for patient-centered care and improving\u00a0population health\u00a0has led to increased collaboration among hospitals, according to a nationwide\u00a0survey\u00a0from the American Hospital Association.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "The push for patient-centered care and improving\u00a0population health\u00a0has led to increased collaboration among hospitals, according to a nationwide\u00a0survey\u00a0from the American Hospital Association.", "title": "Population health initiatives drive hospital collaboration", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/population-health-initiatives-drive-hospital-collaboration/2015-08-27", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "American Hospital Assocation,Care Delivery,Community Partnerships,health determinants,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes,Population Health,public health", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe25b4\"", "article_summary": "The findings reveal:Eighty-five percent of hospitals reported strong or total commitment to population health or have population health in their vision statements.\nTo learn more:- download the survey results (.pdf)Related Articles:The future of population health management3 strategies to drive population healthAscension CEO Tony tersigni on culture change and population health strategiesWhy the next generation of nurses must look at social determinants of health\nThe survey asked hospital leaders about their partnerships with community organizations, the process of assessing community health needs and the structure of population health initiatives.\nMore than 90 percent of hospitals agreed or strongly agreed that population health was aligned with their mission.\nThe push for patient-centered care and improving population health has led to increased collaboration among hospitals, according to a nationwide survey from the American Hospital Association (AHA)."}
