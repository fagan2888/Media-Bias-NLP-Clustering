Consider the many ironies of the 2014 elections. Georgia, the state with the highest unemployment in the nation, just elected as its United States senator a businessman who is \u201cproud\u201d of his career of outsourcing. The voters of Illinois overwhelmingly approved a referendum calling for a higher minimum wage, but they also chose as their governor a Wall Street type who in the past has asserted that the minimum wage ought to be reduced or eliminated. And the public as a whole, driven to fury by the spectacle of Washington gridlock, just handed over the U. S. Senate to a party that has enshrined obstructionism as its most precious article of faith.\n\nLow turnout is one reason for these contradictory results. Big money is a second. But a third reason voters did these futile, clashing things is that this is our fourth hard-times election in a row. Lashing out blindly and in all directions against the powerful \u2014 against low wages as well as against a comfortable \u201cclass\u201d that is amply represented in Washington \u2014 is still our political default position, some six years after the financial crisis and the Wall Street bailout. For many Americans, the recession is still on. They know that their region hasn\u2019t recovered \u2026 that their household wealth isn\u2019t coming back \u2026 that people like them no longer have a shot at the middle-class life in which they were raised.\n\nThe point of the Tea Party movement, back in 2009 and 2010, was to attach this anger to the free-market philosophy. Tea Partyers figured out a way to oppose the bailouts even though Republicans had passed them. They mimicked the protest fashions of the 1930s even though that was a period uniquely lousy for Republicans. They screamed about what they called \u201cthe ruling class\u201d even though their bad ideas would only empower our economic rulers. And taking the novels of Ayn Rand as inspiration, they hijacked the populist sensibility on behalf of the \u201cjob creators\u201d \u2014 the poor, disrespected billionaires, your comrades in suffering.\n\nIn their mission of rescuing free-market orthodoxy after free-market orthodoxy had crashed the global economy, the Tea Party succeeded. They don\u2019t hold protests in parks anymore, but their distinctive species of cultural theft persists nevertheless; it will go on until economic conditions on the ground improve or until the genuine owners of the populist tradition finally take it back from them.\n\nThere is no danger of either happening any time soon. Indeed, it is now possible for a Republican soldier like Frank Luntz to explain the Republican victory by writing, \u201cPeople say Washington is broken and on the decline, that government no longer works for them \u2014 only for the rich and powerful.\u201d You read that right: After deliberately breaking Washington, the Republican Party just rode to power by protesting Washington\u2019s brokenness. Having done all they could to enrich the rich and empower the powerful, the GOP has now succeeded in presenting itself as America\u2019s warrior for social justice.\n\nLuntz isn\u2019t the only one saying things like this. Consider the recent doings of Freedom Partners, a group aligned with the Koch brothers, whose TV commercials ran wall-to-wall in Kansas during the last week before the election. Navigate your way to their website and click upon the link reading \u201cCronyism in America,\u201d and you will find a remarkable exposition of purest market populism, in which every form of government economic activity from the 2009 stimulus down to licenses issued by local governments is said to be a kind of corruption, a cruel trick played on average people by the powerful. Populism of this sort is enormously useful because it allows Freedom Partners to vituperate against rich and powerful business interests without actually threatening rich and powerful business interests.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Once again, Republicans used their patented brand of fake populism to make Democrats look like chumps", "author": "Thomas Frank", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Once again, Republicans used their patented brand of fake populism to make Democrats look like chumps", "title": "The GOP\u2019s poisonous double-speak: Thomas Frank on how Republicans hijacked the midterms", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/11/09/the_gops_poisonous_double_speak_thomas_frank_on_how_republicans_hijacked_the_midterms/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/11/rove_koch.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Once again, Republicans used their patented brand of fake populism to make Democrats look like chumps", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/11/rove_koch.jpg", "title": "The GOP\u2019s poisonous double-speak: Thomas Frank on how Republicans hijacked the midterms", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "The GOP\u2019s poisonous double-speak: Thomas Frank on how Republicans hijacked the midterms", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 2014 elections, David Koch, Editor's Picks, GOP, Karl Rove, Populism, robo-calls, The Koch Brothers, The Republican Party", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdebf5\"", "article_summary": "In their mission of rescuing free-market orthodoxy after free-market orthodoxy had crashed the global economy, the Tea Party succeeded.\nThe point of the Tea Party movement, back in 2009 and 2010, was to attach this anger to the free-market philosophy.\nPopulism of this sort is enormously useful because it allows Freedom Partners to vituperate against rich and powerful business interests without actually threatening rich and powerful business interests.\nThey mimicked the protest fashions of the 1930s even though that was a period uniquely lousy for Republicans.\nTea Partyers figured out a way to oppose the bailouts even though Republicans had passed them."}
