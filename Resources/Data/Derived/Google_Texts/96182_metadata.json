Suddenly, two police officers appeared, their guns drawn, yelling, \u201cChico Police Department.\u201d\n\n\u201cI had tunnel vision,\u201d Gill said, \u201cThe only thing I could see was their guns.\u201d\n\nAfter telling him to step outside with his hands in the air, the officers lowered their guns and explained. They had received a report \u2014 later determined to be unfounded \u2014 that a suspect in a domestic disturbance had fled into Gill\u2019s house. The police officers asked the then-26-year-old if one of them could do a sweep of the premises. Afraid and feeling he had no alternative, Gill agreed. One officer remained with him, while the other conducted the search. After that they took down Gill\u2019s identification information. Then they were gone \u2014 but not out of his life.\n\nInstead, Gill became the subject of a \u201csuspicious activity report,\u201d or SAR, which police officers fill out when they believe they\u2019re encountering a person or situation that \u201creasonably\u201d might be connected in some way to terrorism. The one-page report, filed shortly after the May 2012 incident, offered no hint of terrorism. It did, however, suggest that the two officers had focused on Gill\u2019s religion, noting that his \u201cfull conversion to Islam as a young [white male] and pious demeanor is [sic] rare.\u201d\n\nThe report also indicated that the officer who entered the house had looked at Gill\u2019s computer screen and recalled something \u201csimilar to \u2018Games that fly under the radar\u2019\u201d on it. According to the SAR, this meant Gill \u201chad potential access to flight simulators via the Internet.\u201d Gill suspects that he was probably looking at a website about video games. The SAR also noted earlier police encounters with Gill, in his mosque and on the street. It recorded his \u201cfull beard and traditional garb\u201d and claimed that he avoided \u201ceye contact.\u201d\n\nIn short, the Chico Police Department was secretly keeping tabs on Gill as a suspected terrorist. Yet nowhere in the SAR was there a scintilla of evidence that he was engaged in any kind of criminal activity whatsoever. Nevertheless, that report was uploaded to the Central California Intelligence Center, one of a network of Department of Homeland Security-approved domestic intelligence fusion centers. It was then disseminated through the federal government\u2019s domestic intelligence-sharing network as well as uploaded into an FBI database known as e-Guardian, after which the Bureau opened a file on Gill.\n\nWe do not know how many government agencies now associate Wiley Gill\u2019s good name with terrorism. We do know that the nation\u2019s domestic-intelligence network is massive, including at least 59 federal agencies, over 300 Defense Department units, and approximately 78 state-based fusion centers, as well as the multitude of law enforcement agencies they serve. We also know that local law enforcement agencies have themselves raised concerns about the system\u2019s lack of privacy protections.\n\nAnd it wouldn\u2019t end there for Gill.\n\nThe Architecture of Mass Suspicion\n\nThe SAR database is part of an ever-expanding domestic surveillance system established after 9/11 to gather intelligence on potential terrorism threats. At an abstract level, such a system may seem sensible: far better to prevent terrorism before it happens than to investigate and prosecute after a tragedy. Based on that reasoning, the government exhorts Americans to \u201csee something, say something\u201d \u2014 the SAR program\u2019s slogan.\n\nIndeed, just this week at a conference in New York City, FBI Director James Comey asked the public to report any suspicions they have to authorities. \u201cWhen the hair on the back of your neck stands, listen to that instinct and just tell somebody,\u201d said Comey. And seeking to reassure those who do not want to get their fellow Americans in trouble based on instinct alone, the FBI director added, \u201cWe investigate in secret for a very good reason, we don\u2019t want to smear innocent people.\u201d\n\nThere are any number of problems with this approach, starting with its premise. Predicting who exactly is a future threat before a person has done anything wrong is a perilous undertaking. That\u2019s especially the case if the public is encouraged to report suspicions of neighbors, colleagues, and community members based on a \u201chair-on-the-back-of-your-neck\u201d threshold. Nor is it any comfort that the FBI promises to protect the innocent by investigating \u201csuspicious\u201d people in secret. The civil liberties and privacy implications are, in fact, truly hair-raising, particularly when the Bureau engages in abusive and discriminatory sting operations and other rights violations.\n\nAt a fundamental level, suspicious activity reporting, as well as the digital and physical infrastructure of networked computer servers and fusion centers built around it, depends on what the government defines as suspicious. As it happens, this turns out to include innocuous, First Amendment-protected behavior.\n\nAs a start, a little history: the Nationwide Suspicious Activity Reporting Initiative was established in 2008 as a way for federal agencies, law enforcement, and the public to report and share potential terrorism-related information. The federal government then developed a list of 16 behaviors that it considered \u201creasonably indicative of criminal activity associated with terrorism.\u201d Nine of those 16 behaviors, as the government acknowledges, could have nothing to do with criminal activity and are constitutionally protected, including snapping photographs, taking notes, and \u201cobservation through binoculars.\u201d\n\nUnder federal regulations, the government can only collect and maintain criminal intelligence information on an individual if there is a \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d that he or she is \u201cinvolved in criminal conduct or activity and the information is relevant to that criminal conduct or activity.\u201d The SAR program officially lowered that bar significantly, violating the federal government\u2019s own guidelines for maintaining a \u201ccriminal intelligence system.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s good reason for, at a minimum, using a reasonable suspicion standard. Anything less and it\u2019s garbage in, garbage out, meaning counterterrorism \u201cintelligence\u201d databases become anything but intelligent.\n\nWhen the Mundane Looks Suspicious\n\nThe SAR program provides striking evidence of this.\n\nIn 2013, the ACLU of Northern California obtained nearly 2,000 SARs from two state fusion centers, which collect, store, and analyze such reports, and then share those their intelligence analysts find worthwhile across what the federal government calls its Information Sharing Environment. This connects the fusion centers and other federal agencies into an information-sharing network, or directly with the FBI. Their contents proved revealing.\n\nA number of reports were concerned with \u201cME\u201d \u2014 Middle Eastern \u2014 males. One headline proclaimed, \u201cSuspicious ME Males Buy Several Large Pallets of Water at REDACTED.\u201d Another read, \u201cSuspicious Activities by a ME Male in Lodi, CA.\u201d And just what was so suspicious about this male? Read into the document and you discover that a sergeant at the Elk Grove Police Department had long been \u201cconcerned about a residence in his neighborhood occupied by a Middle Eastern male adult physician who is very unfriendly.\u201d And it\u2019s not just \u201cMiddle Eastern males\u201d who provoke such suspicion. Get involved in a civil rights protest against the police and California law enforcement might report you, too. A June 2012 SAR was headlined \u201cDemonstration Against Law Enforcement Use of Excessive Force\u201d and reported that \u201ca scheduled protest\u201d by demonstrators \u201cconcerned about the use of excessive force by law enforcement officers\u201d was about to occur.\n\nWhat we have here isn\u2019t just a failure to communicate genuine threat information, but the transformation of suspicion into pernicious ideological, racial, and religious profiling, often disproportionately targeting activists and American Muslims. Again, that\u2019s not surprising. Throughout our history, in times of real or perceived fear of amorphously defined threats, government suspicion focuses on those who dissent or look or act differently.\n\nCounterterrorism Accounting\n\nLaw enforcement officials, including the Los Angeles Police Department\u2019s top counterterrorism officer, have themselves exhibited skepticism about suspicious activity reporting (out of concern with the possibility of overloading the system).\n\nIn 2012, George Washington University\u2019s Homeland Security Policy Institute surveyed counterterrorism personnel working in fusion centers and in a report generally accepting of SARs noted that the program had \u201cflooded fusion centers, law enforcement, and other security outfits with white noise,\u201d complicating \u201cthe intelligence process\u201d and distorting \u201cresource allocation and deployment decisions.\u201d In other words, it was wasting time and sending personnel off on wild goose chases.\n\nA few months later, a scathing report from the Senate subcommittee on homeland security described similar intelligence problems in state-based fusion centers. It found that Department of Homeland Security (DHS) personnel assigned to the centers \u201cforwarded \u2018intelligence\u2019 of uneven quality \u2014 oftentimes shoddy, rarely timely, sometimes endangering citizens\u2019 civil liberties and Privacy Act protections\u2026 and more often than not unrelated to terrorism.\u201d\n\nEffectiveness doesn\u2019t exactly turn out to be one of the SAR program\u2019s strong suits, though the government has obscured this by citing the growing number of SARs that have triggered FBI investigations. However, according to a report from the Government Accountability Office (GAO), the FBI doesn\u2019t track whether SARs uploaded into the domestic intelligence network actually help thwart terrorism or lead to arrests or convictions.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Suspicious Activity Report is the newest way Big Brother is secretly keeping tabs on ordinary citizens", "author": "Matthew Harwood and Hina Shamsi", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The Suspicious Activity Report is the newest way Big Brother is secretly keeping tabs on ordinary citizens", "title": "America\u2019s dystopian new normal: Endless suspicion, limitless spying", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/11/09/mass_surveillance_out_of_control_uncle_sams_limitless_spying_database_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/11/shutterstock_145644685.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Suspicious Activity Report is the newest way Big Brother is secretly keeping tabs on ordinary citizens", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/11/shutterstock_145644685.jpg", "title": "America\u2019s dystopian new normal: Endless suspicion, limitless spying", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "America\u2019s dystopian new normal: Endless suspicion, limitless spying", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, CIA, Department of Homeland Security, FBI, Homeland Security, mass surveillance, Spying, TomDispatch.com, TSA", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdef21\"", "article_summary": "Nevertheless, that report was uploaded to the Central California Intelligence Center, one of a network of Department of Homeland Security-approved domestic intelligence fusion centers.\nA few months later, a scathing report from the Senate subcommittee on homeland security described similar intelligence problems in state-based fusion centers.\nThis connects the fusion centers and other federal agencies into an information-sharing network, or directly with the FBI.\nCounterterrorism AccountingLaw enforcement officials, including the Los Angeles Police Department\u2019s top counterterrorism officer, have themselves exhibited skepticism about suspicious activity reporting (out of concern with the possibility of overloading the system).\nAt a fundamental level, suspicious activity reporting, as well as the digital and physical infrastructure of networked computer servers and fusion centers built around it, depends on what the government defines as suspicious."}
