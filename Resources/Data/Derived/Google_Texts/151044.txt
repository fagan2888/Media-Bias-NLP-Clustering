Drudge Report editor, Breitbart News contributor, and Washington Times columnist Charles Hurt is a potential candidate for Congress in Virginia’s 5th District, according to the Richmond Times-Dispatch.

Hurt’s brother, Rep. Robert Hurt (R-VA), announced last week that he is retiring from Congress when his term ends in 2016.

In addition to his weekly “Nuclear Option” column for Breitbart News, Hurt is a Fox News contributor who is the former Washington editor of the New York Post. His columns have resonated with Breitbart News readers because they often take on the GOP establishment and the cronyism associated with Washington’s bipartisan permanent political class.

Robert Hurt reportedly decided to retire because “he had come to loathe the political process of Washington.”

Robert Hurt defeated Rep. Tom Perriello (D-VA), who got elected along with Obama in 2008, in 2010 in a race that signified how unpopular President Barack Obama—and his liberal policies like Obamacare and cap and trade—was. Despite having barely won his election in a Republican-leaning district after a recount in 2008, Perriello veered to the left and embraced Obama’s agenda, voting for Obamacare and cap and trade. And that gave Robert Hurt all the ammunition he needed to oust Perriello. Obama campaigned for Perriello in the last days of the election to no avail.

As the Richmond Times-Dispatch noted, Robert Hurt, 46, is “a married father of three teenagers” and “a lawyer and former member of the Chatham Town Council. He served in the House of Delegates from 2002 to 2007 and in the state Senate from 2008 to 2011.”

Former Del. Clarke Hogan and NASCAR driver Jeff Burton may also reportedly run for the 5th District seat.
