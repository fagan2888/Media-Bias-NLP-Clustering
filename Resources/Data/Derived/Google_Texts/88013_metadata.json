We still have quite a ways to go before we can declare it\u2019s a breakout, but there\u2019s been some other news around wages that is also brightening outlook.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: You know, we\u2019ve been seeing these stories of companies like Walmart or McDonald\u2019s announcing planned wage increases. Is that likely to have an impact on the overall economy considering the number of low-wage workers there are?\n\nERIC MORATH: Yes, I think it will have an impact in pockets of the economy. Keep in mind, one of the fastest growing areas during this recovery has been restaurant jobs, and not too far behind that has been retailers. A lot of folks have taken up employment in these fields, and so now that we might be seeing some wage growth by the leaders in those areas, that could translate into better consumer spending.\n\nBut it might not have a huge impact on the overall wage growth, because you have to keep in mind \u2014 these are low-wage jobs, often $8, $10, $12 an hour.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: And how does that compare with what the cost of living or the consumer price index is these days?\n\nERIC MORATH: Well, one good note, wages have been growing 2.2 percent over the past year, according to yesterday\u2019s jobs report. At the same time, consumer prices, thanks to falling oil, has been barely moving ahead at all. So, these wage increases should feel real to consumers. So, it is a help.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: OK. And then how does this fit in this larger picture? You mentioned the price of oil. When the price of oil goes down, people feel like they have more money in their pockets. Is that the reason they go out to restaurants, and that\u2019s the reason restaurants have to hire more workers. I mean, how does it all connect?\n\nERIC MORATH: Yes, there\u2019s definitely a connection there. Restaurants have been one area, one of the few areas within consumer spending that we\u2019ve really seen strong growth with the fall in oil prices. It hasn\u2019t quite translated to other areas like your general merchandise stores yet. So, that\u2019s connection, that people feel a little bit better and maybe they go out and spend.\n\nBut the consumers are still cautious. We are seeing the highest savings rates in several years, and we\u2019ve seen, since the holiday season, not particularly robust overall consumer spending. So, I think there\u2019s still a sense that, you know, after the deep recession, people just aren\u2019t willing to open up their wallets quite as far.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: And then how do these numbers about wage increases connect to this overall job creation report because this is all the jobs that are created, not necessarily just low-wage jobs, right?\n\nERIC MORATH: Oh, that\u2019s right. So we had been seeing a quite robust job growth before March, the previous 12 months. We\u2019d seen the strongest job creation on a monthly average since the 1990s.\n\nSo, certainly that was quite strong. We had a step-back in March. That could be for a number of reasons, including \u2014 you know, a stronger dollar reducing exports and there\u2019s an economic slowdown in Asia and parts of Europe, and that might just be causing businesses to be a little bit cautious.\n\nThe trend for jobs is still up. We\u2019d expect to see wages accelerate if we continue to be adding jobs at the pace we had been before last month.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: All right. Eric Morath of \u201cThe Wall Street Journal\u201d joining us from Washington \u2014 thanks so much.\n\nERIC MORATH: Sure, anytime.", "article_metadata": {"description": "There was a bright spot in Good Friday's disappointing jobs report that revealed the number of jobs added fell well below expectations: Wages, stuck for so long, are finally starting to go up.
