Melina Mara/The Washington Post\n\nVoters decide who controls the Senate, the size of the Republican majority in the House and the fate of most of the country\u2019s governors.\n\nOn Tuesday, voters will decide who controls the Senate, the size of the Republican majority in the House and the fate of most of the country\u2019s governors.\n\nOn Tuesday, voters will decide who controls the Senate, the size of the Republican majority in the House and the fate of most of the country\u2019s governors.\n\nThey are scared in Colorado, worried about Ebola and illegal immigration. They are angry in North Carolina, convinced that the president aims to take their guns and limit their health care. They are frustrated in New Hampshire, searching in vain for politicians who will admit the success of Obamacare.\n\nOn Election Day 2014, more than two years before the end of a two-term presidency that floated into being on a cloud of hope, voters sound sullen, even surly. And some non-voters pronounce themselves almost audaciously hopeless, dismissing the multibillion-dollar political campaign industry as a cynical sideshow that ignores the pain of Americans who have lost jobs, see no career paths and wonder what\u2019s gone wrong with their country.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t even want to vote for the guy I want to vote for because I\u2019m tired of hearing his name,\u201d said Chelsea Boucher, 31, in Colorado Springs. She cast her ballot for Democratic incumbents in the Senate and governor\u2019s races, but did it with no enthusiasm, both because Gov. John Hickenlooper was inundating her TV with commercials and because those ads warned ad nauseum that the other guy would attack women\u2019s reproductive rights, as if that were the only issue women cared about.\n\nThere\u2019s an epidemic of annoyance, a veritable virus of vitriol, aimed at nearly every politician who approves those incessant, infernal messages that bash the other guy and turn local elections into referendums on a president heading into lame-duck territory.\n\nJohn Deuser is a registered Republican in Wichita, who drifted away from his roots this year to volunteer for independent Senate candidate Greg Orman and vote for Democrat Paul Davis for governor. Deuser felt pushed out of his comfort zone by last year\u2019s government shutdown. The retired accountant, who had spent 20 years working for Pizza Hut, grew disgusted that lawmakers were getting paid while federal employees were furloughed.\n\n\u201cAt that point, I said, \u2018You know what? I\u2019m not voting for any incumbent,\u2019 \u201d Deuser said. \u201cYou can\u2019t even get along enough to make some kind of decision to keep the government running? What is that all about?\u201d\n\nBut in most races, there was little opportunity to send a throw-the-bums-out message; more than 8 in 10 congressional seats, even in this sour political season, were rock-solid locks for the incumbent, either because no serious challenger stepped up, or because the district had been carved to render one party\u2019s chances almost nil, or because voters keep reelecting their representative even if they think the capital has become a vile pit of snakes.\n\nAccording to exit polls, more than half of voters say they\u2019ve had it with Democrats. And Republicans. And President Obama.\n\nThe Democrats \u201care not for the people,\u201d said Genevieve Haynes, 72, who lives in Prince George\u2019s County, Md., and voted for Republican Larry Hogan for governor. \u201cI was a Democrat up to Jimmy Carter, and that was the end of that. Then I just didn\u2019t vote\u201d for three decades.\n\nShe returned to the polls as a Republican, though really she\u2019s become more of a libertarian, except that she considers a third-party vote a waste. As for the Democrats, \u201cthe way they\u2019re taxing us, we\u2019re not going to have any money left,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople who can work should go to work and not be on welfare.\u201d\n\nIn Sutton, N.H., Joanna Murphy, 51, is similarly indisposed toward Republicans: \u201cThese people don\u2019t represent people like myself that are self-employed, that care about the environment, care about education. They\u2019re in a different world. They care about what\u2019s in their pockets.\u201d\n\nMurphy is miffed by all the ads that bash Democratic candidates for voting with Obama: \u201cWhat is so wrong with being associated with President Obama?\u201d she asked. \u201cHealth-care reform has helped a lot of people. I don\u2019t understand why Democrats are running away from it.\u201d\n\nIt was a day of voters heading to the polls with heavy reservations \u2014 for legalizing marijuana even as they worried that the nation was medicating itself to avoid dark realities, for incumbents even as they blamed the people in office for doing nothing.\n\nRick Waldenmeyer, 70, a retired salesman in Leawood, Kan., is a registered Republican who says Washington has become \u201ca dark hole,\u201d a den of dysfunction. \u201cIt used to be, even if there were great disagreements, people were able to get together for the common good,\u201d he said. \u201cNow it\u2019s, \u2018Hey, my way or the highway.\u2019 \u201d\n\nEven so, Waldenmeyer voted for Republican Sen. Pat Roberts because \u201che\u2019s one of those people who will go back and forth, he will work with the Democrats, he will work with the Republicans.\u201d\n\nSo many factors go into a vote \u2014 family tradition, ideology, a candidate\u2019s personality \u2014 that there are inevitably contradictions in how people behave at the polls. In Arkansas, for example, some voters said they supported a measure to raise the minimum wage even as they voted for Republicans who warned that higher minimums would lead employers to hire fewer people.\n\nThe economy remains a sore spot for many Americans \u2014 in exit polls, 7 in 10 voters say the economy is doing poorly, and an even larger share are worried about the economy\u2019s direction \u2014 and as usually happens in politics, the guy at the top is held accountable.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been so many Obama crises, I can\u2019t keep track of them,\u201d said Denell Whittingham, 62, in Harrisburg, Ark. As she chose between Mark Pryor and Tom Cotton in the Senate race, she thought not of policy positions but of the president and her roll call of crises: immigration, Ebola, the Secret Service, Obamacare.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of like we\u2019re all tired and weary,\u201d she said.\n\nIn New Hampshire, where Senate candidate Scott Brown (R) ran ads saying Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen \u201cvotes with Obama 99 percent of the time,\u201d voters echoed that line.\n\n\u201cThe argument that she voted with Obama 99 percent of the time, I think, is resonating,\u201d said Ernie Richards, 71, who concluded that Brown was \u201cnot someone that\u2019s going to do one thing and say another.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, in North Carolina, voters on both sides put Obama at the fulcrum of their decision-making. In Mocksville on Sunday night, two brothers wearing overalls and driving dark red trucks adorned with homemade signs touted their support of GOP Senate candidate Thom Tillis.\n\nWilliam Easling, 75, and his younger brother Gerald, 72, crafted posters calling this \u201cthe worst-run administration in history.\u201d\n\n\u201cKay Hagan voted for Obamacare!\u201d said one sign, ripping the Democratic senator for her support of the president.\n\nElsewhere in North Carolina, the only state to back Obama in 2008 but not in 2012, Democratic voters agree this election is about the president.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe in Republicans,\u201d declared Marvin \u201cChicago\u201d Godfrey, of Greensboro as he got into a van shuttling people to the polls Tuesday. \u201cWhen Barack first ran, I used to volunteer in the office downtown for him. So that\u2019s why I\u2019m out tonight. This is for him.\u201d\n\nIn much of the country, though, Americans were out neither for Republicans nor Democrats, but rather for the party of none.\n\n\u201cI used to vote and care but I just lost interest,\u201d said Mitzi Martin, 30, a waitress at Poor Boy Lloyd\u2019s, a Baton Rouge, La., institution for politicians and statehouse workers. ESPN2 was on the TV; no one clamored for any of the news channels.\n\nAt PJ\u2019s Coffee in Baton Rouge, Lauren Merrell, 22, a barista and a psychology major at Louisiana State University, also said she would not vote: \u201cI\u2019ve been too busy with school and work.\u201d Merrell, who has amassed college loans that she said \u201care closer to $50,000 than zero,\u201d concluded from all the ads that \u201cas a young person, I feel I\u2019m not represented. When we get out, there are no jobs for us.\u201d\n\nIn Pella, Iowa, Duane Sabin, 62, didn\u2019t want to say whom he voted for, only that \u201cI voted for the person who has lied the best.\u201d\n\nHe said he has lost faith in politicians: \u201cYou ever hear of swollen-head disease? It\u2019s when people have such big heads you can\u2019t even fit it into your car. That\u2019s what our politicians suffer from. Maybe it\u2019s a virus.\u201d\n\nJose DelReal in New Hampshire, Karen Heller in Louisiana, Elahe Izadi in Kansas, Kathryn Le Dain in Maryland, Wesley Lowrey in North Carolina, Ed O\u2019Keefe in Georgia, Sebastian Payne in Alaska, Hunter Schwarz in Arkansas, Ben Terris in Iowa and Katie Zezima in Colorado contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Both Republicans and Democrats say they\u2019re fed up with Washington \u2014 even as most send incumbents back.", "author": "http://facebook.com/fisherm", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Both Republicans and Democrats say they\u2019re fed up with Washington \u2014 even as most send incumbents back.", "title": "At the polls, voters express exasperation and anxiety", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/at-the-polls-voters-express-exasperation-and-anxiety/2014/11/04/b1bb82ba-6456-11e4-bb14-4cfea1e742d5_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/11/04/National-Politics/Images/America_Votes-0d320-6063.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@mffisher"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/at-the-polls-voters-express-exasperation-and-anxiety/2014/11/04/b1bb82ba-6456-11e4-bb14-4cfea1e742d5_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Elections, midterm elections, midterm elections results, midterms, democrats, republicans, iowa senate rage, Colorado senate race, new Hampshire senate, Arkansas elections, John Hickenlooper, scott brown, Jeanne Shaheen, mary Landrieu, Tom Cotton, mark pryor, kay hagan, thom tills, republican senate, midterm elections republicans, midterm elections democrats", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "http://facebook.com/fisherm"}, "news_keywords": "Elections, midterm elections, midterm elections results, midterms, democrats, republicans, iowa senate rage, Colorado senate race, new Hampshire senate, Arkansas elections, John Hickenlooper, scott brown, Jeanne Shaheen, mary Landrieu, Tom Cotton, mark pryor, kay hagan, thom tills, republican senate, midterm elections republicans, midterm elections democrats", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "eomportal-uuid": "b1bb82ba-6456-11e4-bb14-4cfea1e742d5"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcff4f\"", "article_summary": "According to exit polls, more than half of voters say they\u2019ve had it with Democrats.\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe in Republicans,\u201d declared Marvin \u201cChicago\u201d Godfrey, of Greensboro as he got into a van shuttling people to the polls Tuesday.\nShe returned to the polls as a Republican, though really she\u2019s become more of a libertarian, except that she considers a third-party vote a waste.\nOn Tuesday, voters will decide who controls the Senate, the size of the Republican majority in the House and the fate of most of the country\u2019s governors.\nThey are angry in North Carolina, convinced that the president aims to take their guns and limit their health care."}
