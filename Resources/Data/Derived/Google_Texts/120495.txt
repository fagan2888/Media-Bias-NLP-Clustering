The CDC reports compared the first nine months of 2014 with annual statistics going back as far as 1997, from the National Health Interview Survey. Among the highlights: — The number of uninsured dropped from 48.6 million in 2010 to 37.2 million for the period from Jan.-Sept. last year. That amounted to 11.4 million fewer uninsured since the signing of the health care law. — In 2014, about 27 million people said they had been without coverage for more than a year. — Some 6.8 million people were covered through the health care law's new insurance markets during July-Sept. of 2014. — The most significant coverage gains last year came among adults ages 18-64. Nearly 40 million were uninsured in 2013. But that dropped to 32.6 million in the first nine months of 2014. — States that moved forward with the law's Medicaid expansion saw a bigger decline in the share of their residents uninsured.

The Centers for Disease Control released a pair of reports on Monday calculating that 11 million people who had been uninsured now have insurance, thanks to Obamacare. While 37 million people are still uninsured—some 4 million who would be eligible for Medicaid expansion if the states took it, the remainder undocumented immigrants and people either unaware of or purposefully boycotting insurance— this is the lowest uninsured population in more than 15 years.The discrepancy between the White House's announcement that 16.4 million have gained insurance through Obamacare and the CDC's numbers is that the CDC's numbers don't include the second round of enrollments that began last fall.

Not everyone sees this as a good thing. "House Speaker John Boehner says it amounts to a 'legacy of broken promises.'" What promises were broken, exactly, this article doesn't clarify. Considering the biggest broken promise from Republicans of the past five years—a replacement plan for Obamacare—it's hard to take him too seriously.
