A Salt Lake City police officer has been placed on paid leave after refusing to work at a gay pride parade, reports the Associated Press.

The officer’s name was not released, but department spokeswoman Lara Jones said there will be an internal affairs investigation into the matter.

“We don’t tolerate bias and bigotry in the department, and assignments are assignments,” Jones told the press. “To allow personal opinion to enter into whether an officer will take a post is not something that can be tolerated in a police department.”

Jones hastened to emphasize that the officer in question is not representative of the overall department’s views on people in the LGBTQ community.

“We have gay men and women that serve in the police department,” Jones said to the Salt Lake Tribune. “One officer’s situation does not reflect the vast majority of officers that work in the Salt Lake City Police Department and certainly not Chief [Chris] Burbank’s.”
