It’s a cross-country connection that proved to be life-saving for West Virginia resident and leukemia survivor Randy Pence, a father of three, and one that he was finally able to establish in person this past Saturday.

As reported by WNCN , Pence was able to meet Steven Lasiter, the once-stranger from California who provided him with the bone marrow he needed during his bout with cancer almost four years ago, for the first time at an event held by the Duke Adult Bone Marrow Transplant Program. The program is now in its 30th year, and treated its 5000th recipient earlier this June.

The two men had established an email correspondence a year after the transplant, but it was still an overwhelming experience to see each other in the flesh.

“There’s some things that just leave you speechless and for me to be speechless is pretty amazing,” Pence told WNCN.

And while Lasiter, a one-time Marine and present-day firefighter, has had plenty of experience with saving lives, it was still an unique opportunity he was presented with.

“Being a firefighter, I’ve helped many people through the course of my career. I’ve never had the chance to see it all the way until the end and see how much of an impact something very specific I had done would actually impact someone’s life,” said Lasiter, who originally signed up as a potential donor through the organization Be The Match because a colleague’s relative was in need of a transplant. Though he wasn’t a match for that person, he did turn out to be one for Pence.

Though the two men may never see each other again, they both feel that their shared journey will forever entwine them together, with Pence calling them “blood brothers,” a sentiment that Lasiter can’t help but agree with.

“We’ve definitely become blood brothers, literally,” he said. “This bond that’s been found here is going to be unbreakable.”
