Former White House adviser David Axelrod is widely known for trying to halt President Obama’s healthcare agenda in his first term, but even then, he said he was acutely aware that the system needed fixing.

In an interview on “The Daily Show with Jon Stewart,” the former adviser said his daughter struggled with seizures for nearly two decades — costing him $10,000 or more out of pocket every year.

“I almost went bankrupt,” Axelrod told the Comedy Central host in a show that aired late Tuesday. “So I knew why we needed to reform the healthcare system, but my job was to tell him what the politics were.”

Axelrod said he knew the task was “very difficult” because seven presidents had tried and failed to reform healthcare. But he said Obama wouldn’t back down.

“He said, ‘I get all that, but what are we supposed to do for eight years and put our approval rating on the shelf and just admire it?’ ” Axelrod recalled. “And he said, ‘If we don’t do it now, it’ll never get done.’ ”

On the night that the Affordable Care Act finally passed Congress, Axelrod said he cried in his White House office because he thought about “all the families that would never have to go through” what he did. Axelrod said he also went and thanked the president, to which Obama replied, ‘That’s why I do the work,’ ” he said.

Stewart quipped back: “If I’d been him, I would have been like, ‘See, I told you.’ ”
