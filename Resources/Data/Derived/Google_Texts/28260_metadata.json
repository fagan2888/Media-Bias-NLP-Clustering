Hospitals listed in the report represent a sample of the more than 450 general acute care facilities across the Golden State. The report doesn\u2019t include urgent cares or community health centers that also offer medical services, according to Covered California, the state\u2019s health insurance plan exchange. It\u2019s unclear which plans patients carried, but hospitals operated by Kaiser Permanente were among those that were highly represented, the data show.\n\nBy law, hospital emergency departments have to accept all patients, but in 18 months, there were 65,040 emergency room visits made by those who were enrolled in health insurance through Covered California.\n\nAlso in the data:\n\n\u00b7There were 10,928 incidents of cancer treatment provided, including surgery and chemotherapy.\n\n\u00b7Covered California enrollees had 5,745 babies delivered.\n\n\u00b7Almost 90 transplants were performed for Covered California enrollees at eight hospitals in the state, including lung, kidney, heart and liver transplants.\n\nOpen enrollment for those who want health insurance coverage this year ends January 31. Those who qualified and went without health insurance in 2015 will have to pay a penalty at tax time, which can go up to $325 per adult and $162.50 per child or 2 percent of the total household taxable income, whichever is higher. That rate will rise to $695 per single filer and 2.5 percent come next tax season.", "article_metadata": {"description": "With Obamacare\u2019s open enrollment deadline fast approaching, Covered California officials released new figur", "title": "Covered California pushes deadline message to uninsured", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailynews.com/government-and-politics/20160119/covered-california-pushes-deadline-message-to-uninsured", "image": {"width": "512px", "identifier": "http://local.dailynews.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/small/dailynews_new.png", "height": "512px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Covered California pushes deadline message to uninsured"}, "twitter": {"domain": "dailynews.com", "description": "With Obamacare\u2019s open enrollment deadline fast approaching, Covered California officials released new figur", "title": "Covered California pushes deadline message to uninsured", "url": "http://www.dailynews.com/government-and-politics/20160119/covered-california-pushes-deadline-message-to-uninsured", "image": {"src": "http://local.dailynews.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/small/dailynews.png?052016"}, "site": "@ladailynews", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id551745144", "iphone": "id502957174", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.ladailynews"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "Affordable Care Act,Covered California,daily, Affordable Care Act", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Affordable Care Act,Covered California,daily, Affordable Care Act"}, "article_summary": "With Obamacare\u2019s open enrollment deadline fast approaching, Covered California officials released new figures Tuesday to drive the message that having health insurance coverage means access to hospital care without worrying about big bills.\nThe report doesn\u2019t include urgent cares or community health centers that also offer medical services, according to Covered California, the state\u2019s health insurance plan exchange.\n\u00b7Covered California enrollees had 5,745 babies delivered.\n\u00b7Almost 90 transplants were performed for Covered California enrollees at eight hospitals in the state, including lung, kidney, heart and liver transplants.\nThe data offer some details into how many patients who purchased health plans through Covered California were treated in 111 hospitals statewide for 18 months beginning in January 2014."}
