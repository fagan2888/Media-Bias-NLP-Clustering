( Jeremy Raff/KQED )\n\nWhen it comes to vaccination rates, Alameda County made the comeback of the year in California.\n\nThe county was named by state officials as the \u201cmost improved\u201d for raising the rate of kindergartners with \u201cup-to-date\u201d immunizations, said Amy Pine, immunization director of the Alameda County Public Health Department.\n\n\u201cWe made it our mission to say, \u2018No shots, no records, no school,\u2019\u201d Amy Pine, Alameda County Public Health Department\n\nAbout 97 percent of kindergartners in Alameda had up-to-date vaccinations this school year, compared to 89 percent a year ago, according to the county\u2019s records.\n\n\u201cWe made it our mission to say, \u2018No shots, no records, no school,\u2019 \u201d Pine said. \u201cThe school personnel \u2026 worked so hard. They are the heroes.\u201d\n\nThe countywide turnaround is due in large part to improvement in vaccination rates recorded in the Oakland Unified School District. The district lifted its rates of kindergartners with up-to-date vaccinations from only 75 percent in 2014-15 to 97 percent this year.\n\nIndividual schools had major improvement, like Thornhill Elementary School in Oakland\u2019s Montclair district, which saw its up-to-date vaccination rate skyrocket from 14 percent last year to 96 percent this year.\n\n\u201cWe doubled down on this issue, and we\u2019re glad to see our efforts are paying off, because what it\u2019s really about is the health of all of our children,\u201d said Oakland Unified School District spokesman Isaac Kos-Read.\n\nEven though it\u2019s an issue that gets a lot of attention in the media, the number of parents choosing not to vaccinate their children due to personal beliefs was actually not a major phenomenon in Alameda. Only 1.5 percent of kindergartners in the county had such exemptions in 2014-2015 and it fell to 1 percent this year.\n\nAll children are required to be vaccinated against a range of diseases in order to attend school \u2014 unless they have filed a \u201cpersonal belief exemption\u201d or a medical exemption with their school.\n\nLast summer, California Gov. Jerry Brown signed a law abolishing the personal belief exemption. The law takes effect in July, and in the next school year all students must be vaccinated unless they have a medical exemption.\n\nAlameda County\u2019s major challenge was students with incomplete vaccination records who were allowed \u201cconditional entry\u201d to school. The rate of such admissions was 9.7 percent last year, and this year it has plummeted to 2 percent.\n\nIn Oakland, conditional entrants represented 25 percent of kindergartners last year, and that dropped to about 2 percent, Pine said.\n\nThe high rate of conditional entrants at some schools was in part because those exemptions were used inappropriately, she said. Some school personnel interpreted \u201cconditional entry\u201d to mean that students were allowed to enter school as long as their parents promised to get them the shots in the future.\n\nBut conditional entry is meant for kids who were recently vaccinated and aren\u2019t due for the next shot in the series yet or those who have a temporary medical exemption.\n\nFixing the problem\n\nSchools with low vaccination rates aren\u2019t necessarily filled with unvaccinated children, Pine said. It\u2019s often due to poor record keeping and administrative challenges.\n\nSchool support staffers struggle to enter complete vaccination records because of turnover, lack of training and inadequate time to enter the data or follow up with parents, she said.\n\nAlso, schools have been reluctant to turn away kids just because they don\u2019t have complete vaccinations. There was a financial disincentive to exclude children as schools get funding based on attendance, but the state has taken steps to change that, Pine said.\n\nSchools with problematic vaccination rates in 2014-2015 received a letter saying they would be audited if their Fall 2015 rates didn\u2019t improve, she said.\n\nTo help boost vaccination rates, Pine said, the county department ranked schools on a \u201ccommunity immunity\u201d honor society based on their vaccination rates and sent the listing to school personnel. She said seeing the information displayed like that encouraged officials from schools that were ranked low to ask the county health department how they could turn that around.\n\nThe county health department worked with schools to train staff, she said. A measles outbreak tied to Disneyland, which was first reported last January, helped to boost public awareness about the importance of vaccines, encouraging parents and schools to put a priority on immunizations, Pine said.\n\n\u201cSchools really have to give protected and focused time to staff to do it, where they won\u2019t be interrupted,\u201d Pine said.\n\nIt\u2019s challenging for front desk staff to enter data when students and parents are constantly coming up to them and signing in and out of school.\n\n\u201cMuch of what we needed was in the records,\u201d said Thornhill Elementary School\u2019s secretary, Sheila Smith. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a matter of obtaining it. It was a matter of finding the time.\u201d\n\nShe said entering immunization data is complicated for school staff because not all medical records look alike and the office environment is constantly distracting.\n\nShe said she asked for some dedicated time to work on the project and used personal hours as well, she said.\n\nThe principal, Steven Daubenspeck, said when he learned the school\u2019s rate was so low last year, he began holding weekly meetings to check in with staff to increase accountability on vaccination record keeping. A lot of the information hadn\u2019t been entered on time, he said.\n\n\u201cI was shocked,\u201d he said. \u201cI got the staff to really rally around, and focus on it. I do have immune-compromised kids here, and it\u2019s a life-and-death issue.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The issue was kids who were not up to date with their vaccines.
