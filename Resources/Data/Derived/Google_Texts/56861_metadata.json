Among adolescents sporting the hairstyle, fewer freckles \u2014 a sign of future skin cancer risk \u2014 were counted by dermatologists in a recent study.\n\nThey\u2019re calling it the \u201cNew Big Bang Theory.\u201d By covering the face during youthful exposure to the sun, adolescents may lower their long-term risk of developing deadly skin cancer as they age, wrote Crystal Agi and Bernard Cohen in an editorial this month in JAMA Pediatrics. \u201cFor the past few years, we have embraced this hairstyle in our teenage patient population to encourage discussion of sun protective measures,\u201d they wrote. \u201cIt is believed that the majority of an individual\u2019s lifetime sun exposure occurs during childhood and adolescence, making diligent sun protection during these years critical.\u201d\n\nScientists believe freckles, while not posing a direct health threat, are somehow associated with melanoma in adults. \u201cThose of us who care for children and adolescents should not overlook the influence of a celebrity model even if the big bangs disappear as hairstyles evolve,\u201d they wrote. \u201cThis is a cool way for pediatricians to open conversations with kids about sun protection.\u201d\n\nStill, some kids aren\u2019t buying Bieber\u2019s hype. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t care if a doctor told me about his hair,\u201d Ambrie Rodriguez, 13, of New York City, told the NY Daily News. \u201cI don\u2019t like him. He\u2019s not a role model.\u201d Likewise, 13-year-old Vivian Zhen, also of New York City, denied any affinity for the popstar. \u201cHis hair won\u2019t help others \u2014 he only does things for attention.\u201d\n\nSeveral years ago, Bieber even rapped about New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady for emulating the sweeping hairstyle, closely guarding his signature coiffe. Yet, this week, the singer\u2019s spokesman declined to comment on the JAMA editorial, leaving others to wonder whether clinicians should even broach the subject of the Bieb. Might the same effect be achieved with a hat? Pediatricians throughout New England should take note: Tom Brady wears hats.\n\nSource: Agi, Crystal, Cohen, Bernard.
