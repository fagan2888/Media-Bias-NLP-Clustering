I believe that any human being in this country, regardless of wealth, should receive a reasonable level of basic healthcare, as determined by a qualified physician, for the health condition they have.

It is not morally right for a poor or uninsured person to suffer without proper treatment because they are poor and/or lack health insurance to cover the cost.

In this country, a reasonable level of basic health care, for any legitimate health condition, should be a right, not a privilege.

Children born into poverty deserve the same care for broken bones, cancer, diabetes, or any other disease or condition, regardless of parents wealth.

Many companies do not offer insurance for employees and cannot afford to do so. Many people cannot afford insurance on the private market. Charities can only cover so much.

Before Obamacare, insurance companies regularly denied health insurance, due to pre-existing conditions, even to those that could afford the premiums.

Most of us are one auto-accident or family catastrophic health condition away from bankruptcy, without health insurance.

Yes, we need to reduce the cost of healthcare and insurance. Other countries have done it and we should make that a priority.

But, in the meantime, as a nation, we do not need to be in the business of intentionally denying proper healthcare access to fellow human beings, based on their socio-economic background.

We do not need the haves and the have nots, when it comes to proper healthcare in this country.
