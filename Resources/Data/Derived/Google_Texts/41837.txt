Sam Pesin, President of Friends of Liberty State Park, urges voters to not support New Jersey’s ballot measure regarding open space funding.

We apologize for the lateness of urging you now to vote No on ballot measure 2, which seemed from its innocent language to be another positive open space measure that would help state parks, as well as open space acquisition, with an increased source of sustainable funding.

The Friends board heard this past weekend from trusted people who are very involved in the state park service that passage of ballot measure 2 will take major funds away from Liberty State Park and other state parks, mainly giving them for open space in suburban and rural areas.

Land trust organizations and other environmentalists who don’t care about state parks or urban areas pushed for this ballot measure to support their mission. The legislation setting up the ballot measure was very deceiving.

So please vote No to stand up for LSP and other state parks with their backlog of $400 million of needed capital improvements.

If measure #2 passes, the Friends will need your help in contacting legislators to advocate that the measure’s “enabling legislation” ensures that some money goes to state parks and to work for other sources of state funds.
