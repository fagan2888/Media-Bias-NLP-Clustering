They\u2019ve managed to turn their brutal image into something now even youngsters look up to and want to be a part of. In February, we saw this happen in Yemen with a group of boys not playing cops and robbers, but a \u2018game\u2019 of Jihadi John and the Christian captives. While these children only re-enacted the brutal mass beheadings with sticks, elsewhere in Yemen recently, youngsters actually attempted to immolate a 10-year-old boy as ISIS did to Jordanian pilot Muath Al Kasaesbeh.\n\nInspired by the video of Daesh burning to death the Jordanian pilot Muath Al Kasaesbeh, a group of boys set about re-enacting the atrocity in their Al Dahthath village in Yemen\u2019s northern province of Ibb.\n\nAccording to local journalist Mohammad Mouzahem, as many as seven boys recently entrapped a 10-year-old boy in a wooden cage and poured fuel over him. One of them acted as a Daesh leader sitting on a chair and gave orders to his operatives to set the boy on fire.\n\nArriving in the nick of time, residents were shocked when they saw the boy alight crying for help as his friends watched.\n\nMouzahem said: \u201cThe villagers took him to a local hospital where he received treatment for burns to one of his legs.\u201d\n\nDespite living in a destitute village where power cuts are frequent, Mouzahem said the graphic clip of the pilot reached the village via WhatsApp and mobile phones.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Horrific. .05/26/2016 18:58:07PM EST.", "author": "Leah Barkoukis", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Horrific.", "title": "Leah Barkoukis - Inspired by Murder of Jordanian Pilot, Yemeni Children Light Village Boy on Fire", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/leahbarkoukis/2015/03/12/inspired-by-murder-of-jordanian-pilot-yemeni-children-light-village-boy-on-fire-n1969718", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2015/3/12/16.png", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Horrific.", "title": "Leah Barkoukis - Inspired by Murder of Jordanian Pilot, Yemeni Children Light Village Boy on Fire", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/leahbarkoukis/2015/03/12/inspired-by-murder-of-jordanian-pilot-yemeni-children-light-village-boy-on-fire-n1969718", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2015/3/12/16.png", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Inspired by Murder of Jordanian Pilot, Yemeni Children Light Village Boy on Fire , Leah Barkoukis, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "While these children only re-enacted the brutal mass beheadings with sticks, elsewhere in Yemen recently, youngsters actually attempted to immolate a 10-year-old boy as ISIS did to Jordanian pilot Muath Al Kasaesbeh.\nAccording to local journalist Mohammad Mouzahem, as many as seven boys recently entrapped a 10-year-old boy in a wooden cage and poured fuel over him.\nInspired by the video of Daesh burning to death the Jordanian pilot Muath Al Kasaesbeh, a group of boys set about re-enacting the atrocity in their Al Dahthath village in Yemen\u2019s northern province of Ibb.\nArriving in the nick of time, residents were shocked when they saw the boy alight crying for help as his friends watched.\nOne of them acted as a Daesh leader sitting on a chair and gave orders to his operatives to set the boy on fire."}
