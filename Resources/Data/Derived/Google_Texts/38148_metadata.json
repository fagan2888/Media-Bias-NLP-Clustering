This has led to predictable carping from Republicans, who think it\u2019s unfair that men are subsidizing services, specifically maternity care, that they will never use. Jonathan Cohn at the New Republic has a good explanation for men about why they should be paying for maternity care: The long-term prosperity of the U.S. depends on healthy citizens, men supply the sperm, it\u2019s just a genetic lottery that made you a man and not a woman, and think of your mother who had to bear you!\n\nJessica Grose Jessica Grose is a frequent Slate contributor and the author of the novel Sad Desk Salad. Follow her on Twitter.\n\n\n\nBut even if you don\u2019t care at all about the women bearing the children, you should care about live human babies that are going to be born regardless of whether their mothers get adequate prenatal care. And really, really bad things happen to babies whose mothers don\u2019t get adequate prenatal care.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nOne-third of all American women will have some kind of pregnancy-related complication, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. When women don\u2019t get adequate prenatal care, those complications don\u2019t get caught and potentially prevented, which is why babies born to mothers who are low-income and uneducated are more likely to have a low birth weight, which can lead to infant health problems like respiratory distress and bleeding in the brain. It can also lead to lifelong health problems, like high blood pressure, heart disease, and diabetes, according to the March of Dimes.\n\nHalf of these babies will be male babies, by the way. Some of those boys and their sisters who are born prematurely (which is more likely to happen when mothers aren\u2019t getting adequate prenatal care) cost the United States approximately $26 billion annually, according to a 2006 report from the Institute of Medicine. That\u2019s $51,600 per infant born prematurely (thanks, American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology, for doing that math).\n\nShould we be charging those male babies who were premature more money when they become adults because they cost so much more when they were born? No, because that\u2019s not how insurance works\u2014as Amanda Marcotte pointed out in a post on Tuesday.", "article_metadata": {"fb-share": "Men Who Don't Want to Pay for Maternity Care Don't Understand the Circle of Life", "sailthru.author": "Jessica Grose", "description": "The Affordable Care Act says that women cannot be charged higher rates for insurance than men are.
