Their activities were recorded by photographer Steve Eberhardt.\n\nThe groups had posted on their Facebook pages the names, background information, and contact information of the counter-demonstrators.\n\nOn Saturday, August 01, 2015, hundreds of people bearing Confederate flags and guns had gathered at Stone Mountain park to promote the Confederate flag as a symbol of \u201cheritage, not hate.\u201d\n\nThe rally was convened in reaction to calls from the Atlanta branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People to remove the carving of Confederate generals from the side of the mountain.\n\nAt the rally, a group of counter demonstrators faced off with the flag supporters.\n\nDiMassimo shredded and stomped on a Confederate flag while preaching against racism.\n\nLucier, a prominent figure in Atlanta\u2019s Black Lives Matter movement, also stood on the flag and delivered an impassioned speech as the crowd jeered.\n\nThe back and forth was heated, and at one point a flag supporter began to draw a gun on DiMassimo, but a police officer intervened.\n\nFurther backlash was yet to come.\n\nThe flag rally was organized by a man named JT Nicholson who started a Facebook page called CSA Flag Rally 2015 (CSA stands for Confederate States of America).\n\nOn August 02, 2015, Nicholson posted the following message:\n\n\u201cThrough a little investigating threw [sic] a source from Tennessee he said ** Ive [sic] been investigating the four main protestors at the rally all day and I have all their names locations and the groups they are with etc. Also photos of them standing on the American flag etc. They are also Actors. All four of them make movies and have a production company.. ** So they were paid to start drama and hate!\u201d\n\nHe then posted photos of three counter-demonstrators.\n\nHe had drawn red circles around them to distinguish them from the rest of the crowd. The photos were accompanied by personal information that seemed to have been gleaned from their social media pages.\n\nAtlanta Progressive News has obtained copies of the photos, but is declining to publish them in these circumstances.\n\nThe photos have since been taken down, although the original message is still on the CSA Flag Rally 2015 Facebook page as of the afternoon of August 08, 2015.\n\nAnother page called Confederate Flag Stealers posted similar information but with an even scarier tone.\n\nThe page\u2019s users also targeted Lucier but somehow found her home address and posted it, along with threats of violence.\n\nThere is speculation that they paid for a background check in order to find the information.\n\nThe page was rife with racial slurs and hateful rhetoric.\n\nSupporters of the targeted activists began appealing to Facebook to remove the page.\n\nFacebook initially responded by saying that the page did not violate its community standards.\n\nBy August 07, 2015 that changed. Enough people had reported the page that Facebook finally took it down.\n\nThe rally at Stone Mountain happened amidst a wave of backlash against the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nThe KKK has ramped up activity, most notably holding a demonstration in Charleston, South Carolina, where a White supremacist murdered nine Black churchgoers earlier this year.\n\nConfederate flag rallies have taken place in dozens of other U.S. cities. Confederate flags were recently discovered placed on the grounds of Ebenezer Baptist church.\n\nAlso, as Atlanta Progressive News previously reported, Councilman Michael Julian Bond (Post 1-at-large) received a hateful and threatening email after the Atlanta City Council recently passed a resolution he had authored calling for Gov. Nathan Deal to initiate a study of how the carving could be augmented:\n\nhttp://atlantaprogressivenews.com/2015/07/29/atlanta-councilman-receives-threat-after-stone-mountain-resolution-passes/\n\nConfederate Flag supporters are planning another rally at Stone Mountain for August 22, 2015.\n\n(END/2015)", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.2.8", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda52c\"", "article_summary": "(APN) ATLANTA \u2014 Two groups involved in a recent pro-Confederate flag rally appear to have threateningly targeted counter-demonstrators online.\nConfederate flag rallies have taken place in dozens of other U.S. cities.\nDiMassimo shredded and stomped on a Confederate flag while preaching against racism.\nThe flag rally was organized by a man named JT Nicholson who started a Facebook page called CSA Flag Rally 2015 (CSA stands for Confederate States of America).\nAll four of them make movies and have a production company.. ** So they were paid to start drama and hate!\u201dHe then posted photos of three counter-demonstrators."}
