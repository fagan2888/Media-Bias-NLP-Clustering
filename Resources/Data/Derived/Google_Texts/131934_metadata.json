(AP Photo)\n\nHealth insurance customers in many states will see major increases in 2016\u2014some by double-digit percentages\u2014according to a new report by the Kaiser Family Foundation. And what\u2019s the advice many are receiving to combat these increases? Just take advantage of Obamacare subsidies, the Advanced Premium Tax Credit, to reduce the premiums.\n\nThis line of thinking is completely backward.\n\nIndividuals and families who are facing these health insurance premium increases next year\u2014a direct result of the Affordable Care Act\u2014are being told to check out the \u201csavings\u201d by taking advantage of the subsidies offered through Obamacare. This is a completely upside-down way of considering health care costs, because while the premium payment might be a bit lower in the short term, we will all pay for these subsidies with higher taxes and fees in the long run. This is another deception by the government\u2014that Obamacare subsidies are \u201cfree money,\u201d when in actuality, it costs all of us more in the end.\n\nAccording to Kaiser, which analyzed premiums in 13 states and Washington, D.C., costs will increase in several states\u2014and at alarming rates. In Minnesota, for example, Twin Cities Business reported that those who purchase individual or family health plans via MNsure, Minnesota\u2019s state health exchange, or directly from insurers, will see their premiums rise between 14 and 49 percent next year, an average of 28.5 percent\u2014the highest increase of any state.\n\nGiven that MNsure has one of the lowest rates of exchange enrollment, resulting in a lack of enrollment dollars needed by the exchange for operating expenses, Minnesota\u2019s sharp premium increases may be a result of that low enrollment rate, or alternatively, an attempt to drive people and their dollars into MNsure for relief from the increases.\n\nBut even if the subsidies were the answer\u2014which they are not\u2014a large portion of those in need of health care coverage aren\u2019t even eligible. For example, KARE-11 TV in Minneapolis/St. Paul recently profiled a local freelance writer who pays $700 for Blue Cross Blue Shield coverage for himself and his wife. Because he is self-employed, the writer does not have company health care available. His deductible is $4,000\u2014a threshold the couple must cross in out-of-pocket spending before the 80/20 co-pay begins.\n\nWith the 2016 increases, this writer will pay a $1,000-plus monthly premium next year if he stays with the same policy\u2014meaning this couple will spend more on health insurance than on their mortgage. And this particular writer and his wife don\u2019t qualify for advance premium tax credits\u2014along with about 40 percent of the population.\n\nOne reason premiums are rising, reported Twin Cities Business, is that \u201cplan providers have miscalculated the health levels among those buying plans via MNsure or directly from insurers. They have turned out to be 'sicker\u2019 and \u2018more expensive\u2019 than they anticipated\u201d\u2014something I predicted when Obamacare was first introduced and became law more than five years ago. In order for government health care to survive, the young and healthy must enroll to keep it alive\u2014and that is not happening. Therefore, costs will continue to increase.\n\nTwila Brase is president and co-founder of Citizens\u2019 Council for Health Freedom (CCHF, www.cchfreedom.org), a Minnesota-based national organization dedicated to preserving patient-centered health care and protecting patient and privacy rights.
