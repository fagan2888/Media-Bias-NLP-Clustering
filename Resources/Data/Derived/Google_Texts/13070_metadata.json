He turned the segment into a mini horror film that's as hilarious as it is scary.\n\nBasically, places like food banks have been turned into beacons of hope in the Obamacare process, providing \"navigators\" who can help citizens sign up for the Affordable Care Act. Colbert talks to a guy who runs one of these food banks and then trolls the hell out of one of the \"navigators\" by overusing their safety word \"pumpkin patch.\"\n\nI'm a deeply religious Catholic and I don't believe in contraception.
