In an interview Thursday with The Associated Press, Ginsburg said attitudes have shifted in favor of gay marriage, and predicted the court would rule on the matter either next summer or in 2016.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, she plans to be around when it happens. The 81-year-old justice pooh-poohed any notion that she was ready to resign: \u201cRight now, I don\u2019t see any sign that I\u2019m less able to do the job.\u201d\n\nGinsburg, appointed to the Supreme Court by President Bill Clinton, has since 1993 supplied a reliable liberal vote from the court\u2019s left wing. Ginsburg joined the majority of justices who overturned state partial-birth abortion bans in the 2000 case Stenberg v. Carhart, and later wrote the dissent when the Supreme Court, led by Chief Justice John Roberts, in 2007 reversed course and upheld the federal Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, a law Ginsburg called \u201cirrational.\u201d\n\nWe see you\u2019ve been enjoying the content on our exclusive member website.

The other liberal members of the court\u2014Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, and Stephen Breyer, also objected in that case.\n\n\u201cI have no doubt that if the court had been composed of nine women the result would have been different in Hobby Lobby,\u201d said Ginsburg, a former women\u2019s rights attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union, in this week\u2019s interview.\n\nThe contentious social issue of homosexual marriage has been tumultuous in recent months for state legislatures, clerks\u2019 offices, and federal courts, with judges striking down same-sex marriage bans in multiple states, declaring them in violation of the U.S. Constitution. Appeals courts in Denver and Richmond, Va., have upheld such rulings, and the time seems ripe for the Supreme Court to weigh in. A ruling on the constitutionality of same-sex marriage could either leave the issue to the states to decide, or make such marriages legal across the nation, regardless of state laws.\n\nGinsburg would likely favor nationwide legalization. In June 2013, she joined the Supreme Court majority that struck down part of the federal Defense of Marriage Act, which had recognized marriage as between a man and woman. At the same time, she joined the majority of justices declining to rule on the merits of California\u2019s gay marriage ban, Proposition 8. (The state ultimately began issuing same-sex marriage licenses anyway.)\n\nOn Thursday, Ginsburg suggested the high court was unlikely to kick the gay marriage can down the road again. As other liberals have done, she compared the situation to the civil rights battles of the 1960s, including interracial marriage. \u201cI think the court will not do what they did in the old days when they continually ducked the issue of miscegenation,\u201d Ginsburg said. \u201cIf a [same-sex marriage] case is properly before the court, they will take it.\u201d\n\nSome liberals, concerned about Ginsburg\u2019s age, have called on her to resign from the Supreme Court while Obama still has a chance to fill her vacancy with another liberal nominee. Last year, Ginsburg suffered cracked ribs after falling in her bathroom, but stayed on the job, saying in a subsequent interview that she was in excellent health and was lifting weights regularly.\n\nErwin Chemerinsky, dean of the University of California at Irvine law school, wrote in a Los Angeles Times op-ed in March that Ginsburg should retire this summer, while Democrats still hold a majority in the Senate, which is responsible for confirming the president\u2019s Supreme Court nominees.\n\n\u201cIf Ginsburg waits until 2016 to announce her retirement, there is a real chance that Republicans would delay the confirmation process to block an outgoing president from being able to fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court,\u201d Chemerinsky wrote.\n\nGinsburg countered Thursday: \u201cSo who do you think could be nominated now that would get through the Senate that you would rather see on the court than me?\u201d\n\nThe previous eldest liberal justice, John Paul Stevens, did not retire until 2010, at age 90. Obama ultimately replaced him with Kagan.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "WORLD", "description": "The U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s eldest liberal member, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, believes she and her colleagues will decide the issue of same-sex marriage\u2014once", "title": "WORLD | Ruth Bader Ginsberg: Court will rule on gay marriage by 2016 | Daniel James Devine | Aug. 1, 2014", "url": "http://www.worldmag.com/2014/08/ruth_bader_ginsberg_court_will_rule_on_gay_marriage_by_2016", "image": "http://www.worldmag.com/media/images/content/ginsburg_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "keywords": "world magazine, christian world news magazine, christian views, christian perspectives, god's world magazine", "description": "The U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s eldest liberal member, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, believes she and her colleagues will decide the issue of same-sex marriage\u2014once"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8bce\"", "article_summary": "In June 2013, she joined the Supreme Court majority that struck down part of the federal Defense of Marriage Act, which had recognized marriage as between a man and woman.\nOn Thursday, Ginsburg suggested the high court was unlikely to kick the gay marriage can down the road again.\nAppeals courts in Denver and Richmond, Va., have upheld such rulings, and the time seems ripe for the Supreme Court to weigh in.\nThe U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s eldest liberal member, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, believes she and her colleagues will decide the issue of same-sex marriage\u2014once and for all\u2014within the next two years.\nIn an interview Thursday with The Associated Press, Ginsburg said attitudes have shifted in favor of gay marriage, and predicted the court would rule on the matter either next summer or in 2016."}
