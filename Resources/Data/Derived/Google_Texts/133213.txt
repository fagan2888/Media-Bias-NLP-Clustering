“North Carolina’s state budget impasse is leaving many people in limbo, but none more so than the victims of our state’s sterilization program, who in 2013 were allocated a $10 million compensation pool from which they will equally share. They got their first checks, for $20,000 each, this past October. But since then, they have heard hardly anything from the state about their final payments, which could bring their total compensation to as much as $50,000 each.

All across our state, and in other states as well, victims of North Carolina’s program are wondering when they will get their final checks. The state won’t do the victims the simple courtesy of sending them a mass mailing in which it explains the delay. We here at the Journal editorial board tell several victims fortunate enough to have our phone number the reasons for the delay. There’s the state budget process, which is taking the longest time in years for the legislature and the governor to nail down. And even after the state leaders agree on a budget, it’s uncertain when the next compensation payment will go out.”
