Denver police arrested a man who avoided a traffic stop and later rolled his vehicle on Interstate 25 on Saturday night.

Thomas Pilaar, 42, broke an arm in the crash, and was taken to a hospital and faces vehicular eluding charges.

Pilaar was driving a Nissan Sentra on Colorado Boulevard near Louisiana Avenue at 10:05 p.m. when officers attempted to pull him over.

He sped away, heading southbound on Colorado Boulevard. The officers did not pursue him, and near the interstate people signaled for them to stop and told them that a car had just rolled on northbound I-25, said Doug Schepman, police spokesman.
