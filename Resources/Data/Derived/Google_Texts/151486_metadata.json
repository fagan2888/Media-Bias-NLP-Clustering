Some states have made decisions one way on gay marriage, some states have made decisions the other way, and that's the great thing about our Constitution, is different states can make decisions depending on the values of their citizens.\"\n\nRegarding his father Rafael Cruz, a right-wing pastor who's delivered sermons alleging that gay people are sexual predators and have \"highjacked\" the word \"gay,\" the younger Cruz excused his father's antigay animus by citing his faith.\n\n\"Look, my father is a pastor,\" Cruz told Leno. \"He's a man of deep integrity. Some folks have decided to try to go after him because they want to take some shots at me.\"\n\nWatch the gay-adjacent segment of the interview below, and see Cruz's entire appearance at The Tonight Show.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Texas tea party Republican told Jay Leno his dad's antigay rhetoric is a factor of his faith, and the pastor's 'deep integrity.'", "og": {"image": "http://www.advocate.com/sites/advocate.com/files/2013/11/09/Screen%20Shot%202013-11-09%20at%2011.06.08%20AM.png", "title": "WATCH: Ted Cruz's Homophobic Dad is 'Man of Deep Integrity'", "type": "article", "updated_time": "2015-11-17T22:28:15-05:00"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Advocate", "fb": {"page_id": 19799718480, "app_id": 625763650825412, "pages": 6030918854}, "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "article": {"published_time": "2013-11-10T06:40:22-05:00", "modified_time": "2013-11-10T06:40:22-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd6e88\"", "article_summary": "WATCH: Ted Cruz's Homophobic Dad is 'Man of Deep Integrity'The Texas tea party Republican told Jay Leno his dad's antigay rhetoric is a factor of his faith, and the pastor's 'deep integrity.'\n\"Look, my father is a pastor,\" Cruz told Leno.\n\"I support marriage between one man and one woman,\" Cruz told the Tonight Show host.\n\"He's a man of deep integrity.\nWatch the gay-adjacent segment of the interview below, and see Cruz's entire appearance at The Tonight Show."}
