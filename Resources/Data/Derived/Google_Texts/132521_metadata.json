Inside the white, nondescript facility run by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, Ferraz is awaiting deportation to his native Brazil \u2013 which he left as a teenager.\n\nGuards usher Mustelier through the long corridors and steel doors to a visitation area. She and Ferraz sit across from each other in cubicles separated by glass and talk through a telephone.\n\n\u201cI bring pictures of my kids,\u201d says Ferraz, pointing to a Christmas shot of his three young children. Mustelier and Ferraz talk about their families, what books they like, religion.\n\nBut Ferraz keeps returning to how unhappy he is in detention \u2013 and the fact that if he does get deported, he\u2019ll be going to a country he no longer knows.\n\n\u201cCountries change,\" Ferraz said. \"It\u2019s been 20 years since I left Brazil. It\u2019s a whole different planet.\u201d\n\nMustelier, a Miami psychologist, tries to reassure Ferraz, who says her weekly visits help revive his spirits.\n\n\u201cYou guys are busy,\u201d he tells her. \u201cYou could be bowling, you could be on the beach, you could be eating ice cream, and you come and see us. That gives us encouragement.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s at least one part of the mission that volunteers like Mustelier have taken up. Mustelier is a member of Friends of Miami-Dade Detainees (FOMDD), which has been arranging visits to people detained in immigration limbo at Krome since 2014. The Miami program is part of a national, San Francisco-based network called CIVIC, or Community Initiatives for Visiting Immigrants in Confinement.\n\nThe primary goal, says CIVIC executive director Christina Fialho, is to \u201cend [immigrant detainees\u2019] isolation and offer a connection to the outside world.\u201d And at a time when politicians like Donald Trump have taken to demonizing immigrants, Mustelier says the effort might also cast immigrants like Ferraz in a less sinister light.\n\n\u201cI trust that as people become more aware and they start to see [them] as human beings,\u201d she says, it could have a helpful impact on the polarized immigration reform debate.\n\nAfter Ferraz came to the U.S. on a visitor visa in the 1990s and overstayed, he got married, had a family and settled in the Port St. Lucie, Fla. area working manual and construction jobs. But he was also arrested a number of times \u2014 and sentenced most recently for a felony count of marijuana possession.\n\nAlthough it was a non-violent offense, ICE has increasingly prioritized the detention and deportation of felons, so Ferraz landed at Krome in January. An immigration court ordered him deported in February and the Board of Immigration Appeals dismissed his appeal in June, so it could happen any day now.\n\nImmigration lawyers, however, say that many of the detainees held at immigration detention centers like Krome are not criminal felons. They may have been caught crossing the border, or they may be legal permanent residents who were convicted and served sentences for lesser crimes. They can be eligible for deportation if their crimes are more serious.\n\nMarc Moore, Miami field office director for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, takes issue with CIVIC\u2019s contention that the Krome detainees are unduly isolated.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know where their mission statement is coming from,\u201d says Moore. \u201cOur detainees mix and mingle and have a wide range of visitation hours for visitation, a wide range of interactions with clergy and, frankly, attorneys and other legal representatives. They don\u2019t recreate individually. They recreate together.\u201d\n\nStill, Moore says the visitation program is \u201ccertainly not a negative,\u201d as it gives detainees the opportunity \u201cif they feel like they just want to talk\u201d or hang out with another person.\n\nVolunteers often do more than talk.\n\nLidia Moore (no relation to Marc Moore), who got involved with the Miami volunteer program through her church, says often \u201cit\u2019s just little things,\u201d like putting money on a detainee\u2019s phone account or sending him a book to read.\n\nBut Lidia also recalls helping a young detainee who was about to be released. She says he had no family nearby, so his sister called her and asked her to pick him up. When he was released, it was too late to put him on a bus, so she ended up taking him home, and her husband drove him to the Greyhound station the next day.\n\n\u201cIt was very emotional,\u201d she says. \u201cHe called me his angel \u2014 you know, like a guardian angel.\u201d\n\nLidia, who was born in Cuba, says she volunteers in part to counter the negative comments she hears about immigrants. \u201cAs an immigrant myself,\u201d she says, \u201cI felt that it was important to let [detainees] and their families know that there are Americans who care about them and who aren\u2019t judging them for wanting to come and live in this country.\u201d\n\nGlenn Hutchinson, who teaches writing at Florida International University, recently worked with Mustelier to place a mentally ill Krome detainee at Camillus House in Miami, a homeless and social services agency.\n\n\u201cThe problems seem so big that sometimes it can seem overwhelming,\u201d says Hutchinson.\n\nAs a result, says Fialho of CIVIC, the ultimate goal of her campaign is \u201cto see the immigration detention system end.\u201d More specifically, CIVIC hopes to shift toward alternative programs that let undocumented immigrants who are moving through the immigration court system live at home instead of in a detention cell.\n\nIn the meantime, though, volunteers like Mustelier will continue their weekly visits to Krome, talking and listening to men like Ferraz while they ride out their time in detention.\n\nAs she and Ferraz wrap up their visit, they put their hands up on the glass in a ritual salute.\n\n\u201cBehave,\u201d he tells her, a smile on his face. \u201cGo have ice cream.\u201d\n\n\u201cCuidado, cuidado,\u201d she says. Take care.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"category": "HNF Stories", "description": "Listen \n        Listening...", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://health.wusf.usf.edu/post/krome-corps-volunteers-reach-out-immigrants-detention", "image": "http://health.wusf.usf.edu/sites/shared/npr/styles/medium/nprshared/201602/427945277.JPG", "type": "article", "description": "Listen \n        Listening...", "title": "Krome Corps: Volunteers Reach Out To Immigrants In Detention"}, "org_id": 482, "twitter": {"site": "@HealthNewsFL", "card": "summary"}, "wordCount": 1313, "dc": {"title": "Krome Corps: Volunteers Reach Out To Immigrants In Detention"}, "nid": 11423, "datePublished": "2015-07-28", "story_id": 426893783, "keywords": "federal prison, inmate mental health, immigration, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement", "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Immigration lawyers, however, say that many of the detainees held at immigration detention centers like Krome are not criminal felons.\nMarc Moore, Miami field office director for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, takes issue with CIVIC\u2019s contention that the Krome detainees are unduly isolated.\nIn the meantime, though, volunteers like Mustelier will continue their weekly visits to Krome, talking and listening to men like Ferraz while they ride out their time in detention.\nAlthough it was a non-violent offense, ICE has increasingly prioritized the detention and deportation of felons, so Ferraz landed at Krome in January.\nThe Miami program is part of a national, San Francisco-based network called CIVIC, or Community Initiatives for Visiting Immigrants in Confinement."}
