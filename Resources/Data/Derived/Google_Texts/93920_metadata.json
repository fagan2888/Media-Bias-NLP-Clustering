Although the choice of whether or not to breastfeed is a very personal one, for moms who choose to breastfeed, supporting this decision can have far reaching benefits.\n\nAlthough the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends breastfeeding for at least 12 months, many mothers struggle to meet this recommendation. While more than 75 percent of women in the United States begin breastfeeding, when mothers return to work after their babies are born many have difficulty finding the time and space to express milk. The Affordable Care Act seeks to support new moms by requiring employers to provide reasonable break time and a place for nursing mothers to express breast milk for one year after the child\u2019s birth. Long term these family-friendly benefits are a win-win, as they are also good for business, by lowering health care costs, absenteeism, turnover rates, and increasing employee productivity and loyalty.\n\nJoin host Fred Munroe as he speaks with Genevieve Colvin, the Program Manager for BreastfeedLA, and members of the local Central Coast Breastfeeding Coalition as they discuss strategies available to assist businesses and organizations reduce barriers to breastfeeding among employees who have recently given birth in order to ease their transition back to work, as well as move toward full compliance with new breastfeeding laws.\n\nCentral Coast Voices is sponsored by ACTION for Healthy Communities in collaboration with KCBX and made possible through underwriting by Joan Gellert-Sargen.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Community", "description": "Broadcast date: 6/4/2015 Breastfeeding has many benefits: it can help in bonding with a baby, it provides cost savings for a family, and it offers both", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "Central Coast Voices", "og": {"url": "http://kcbx.org/post/breastfeeding-work-let-s-make-it-work", "type": "article", "description": "Broadcast date: 6/4/2015 Breastfeeding has many benefits: it can help in bonding with a baby, it provides cost savings for a family, and it offers both", "title": "Breastfeeding at Work- Let\u2019s Make It Work"}, "story_id": 443541506, "twitter": {"site": "@kcbxnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@kcbxnews"}, "author": "Fred Munroe", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Breastfeeding at Work- Let\u2019s Make It Work"}, "nid": 23319, "datePublished": "2015-05-29", "wordCount": 301, "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb38d\"", "article_summary": "While more than 75 percent of women in the United States begin breastfeeding, when mothers return to work after their babies are born many have difficulty finding the time and space to express milk.\nAlthough the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends breastfeeding for at least 12 months, many mothers struggle to meet this recommendation.\nBroadcast date: 6/4/2015Breastfeeding has many benefits: it can help in bonding with a baby, it provides cost savings for a family, and it offers both mother and baby a number of important health benefits.\nLong term these family-friendly benefits are a win-win, as they are also good for business, by lowering health care costs, absenteeism, turnover rates, and increasing employee productivity and loyalty.\nCentral Coast Voices is sponsored by ACTION for Healthy Communities in collaboration with KCBX and made possible through underwriting by Joan Gellert-Sargen."}
