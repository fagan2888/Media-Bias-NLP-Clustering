Agence France-Presse/Getty Images\n\nNintendo Co.\u2019s shares rose 4% Monday after it unveiled a Pokemon trading-card game for Apple Inc.\u2019s iPad, a move some investors interpreted as a break with the company\u2019s longstanding hesitation about putting its games on other companies\u2019 devices.\n\nNintendo shares rose as high as \u00a512,125, the highest level since July 30, during Monday trading in Tokyo.\n\nThe new iPad app is similar to a version of the Pokemon Trading Card Game that is already available on Windows and Mac computers. It was introduced at the Pokemon World Championship, a tournament held over the weekend in Washington, D.C., said a spokeswoman for the Pokemon Co., an affiliate of Nintendo.\n\n\u201cInvestors took the reports as a sign of a change in Nintendo\u2019s stance of avoiding developing full games for smartphones and tablets,\u201d said Yusuke Sakai, a senior trader at T&D Asset Management.\n\nA Nintendo representative in Japan confirmed the new app on Monday but declined to discuss its implications for Nintendo\u2019s business strategy. The Pokemon spokeswoman said the app\u2019s release date hasn\u2019t been decided. She said the company wasn\u2019t preparing a version for the iPhone or for Android smartphones.\n\nNintendo has kept a cautious stance toward smartphones, although game players are spending more time on mobile devices these days.\n\n\u201cWe are not going to just put our games on smart devices,\u201d Nintendo President Satoru Iwata said in January. \u201cWe need our unique position as a developer of both hardware and software to maintain the scale of business Nintendo aspires to.\u201d\n\nBut the company isn\u2019t totally against the trend.\n\nMr. Iwata said earlier this year that the company would develop a new app by the end of this year to promote its games on smart devices and to help pull it out of a slump that has resulted in three straight years of operating losses.\n\n\u201cOnce there emerges a change in the current view that the company\u2019s future is limited due to a rejection of the smartphone app market, more investors would rush to Nintendo\u2019s shares,\u201d said T&D Asset Management\u2019s Mr. Sakai.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Nintendo Co.'s shares rose 4% Monday after it unveiled a Pokemon trading-card game for Apple Inc.'s iPad, a move some investors interpreted as a break with the company's longstanding hesitation about putting its games on other companies' devices.", "title": "Nintendo Game for iPad Sparks Investor Interest", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/japanrealtime/2014/08/18/nintendo-game-for-ipad-sparks-investor-interest/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-ED580_Pokemo_G_20140818031108.jpg"}, "site": "wsjasia", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "World", "article.headline": "Nintendo Game for iPad Sparks Investor Interest", "description": "Nintendo Co.'s shares rose 4% Monday after it unveiled a Pokemon trading-card game for Apple Inc.'s iPad, a move some investors interpreted as a break with the company's longstanding hesitation about putting its games on other companies' devices.", "article_section": "World", "author": "Megumi Fujikawa", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Japan Real Time Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Japan Real Time", "article.summary": "Nintendo Co.'s shares rose 4% Monday after it unveiled a Pokemon trading-card game for Apple Inc.'s iPad, a move some investors interpreted as a break with the company's longstanding hesitation about putting its games on other companies' devices.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2014-08-18T07:15:48-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-161", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/japanrealtime/2014/08/18/nintendo-game-for-ipad-sparks-investor-interest/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-JRTB-17677", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "World", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Nintendo Co.'s shares rose 4% Monday after it unveiled a Pokemon trading-card game for Apple Inc.'s iPad, a move some investors interpreted as a break with the company's longstanding hesitation about putting its games on other companies' devices.", "title": "Nintendo Game for iPad Sparks Investor Interest", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/japanrealtime/2014/08/18/nintendo-game-for-ipad-sparks-investor-interest/", "image": {"width": 553, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-ED580_Pokemo_G_20140818031108.jpg", "height": 369}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Japan Real Time", "article.id": "BL-JRTB-17677", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-08-18T07:13:48-04:00"}, "article_summary": "Nintendo shares rose as high as \u00a512,125, the highest level since July 30, during Monday trading in Tokyo.\n\u201cWe are not going to just put our games on smart devices,\u201d Nintendo President Satoru Iwata said in January.\nNintendo has kept a cautious stance toward smartphones, although game players are spending more time on mobile devices these days.\nThe new iPad app is similar to a version of the Pokemon Trading Card Game that is already available on Windows and Mac computers.\nInvestors would be pleased if Nintendo characters such as Pikachu had a bigger presence on smartphones."}
