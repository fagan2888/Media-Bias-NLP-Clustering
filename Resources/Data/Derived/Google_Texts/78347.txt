On the most recent episode of “Girls,” Marnie’s life is temporarily ruined by an embarrassing music video she shot with her ex Charlie; he’s uploaded the video to the web and her attempts to get it taken down (and to ignore all the vicious comments) aren’t working.

The video is pretty awful — the second in an ongoing series of musical humiliations for Marnie. (Remember her cover of Kanye West’s “Stronger” last season?) In it, she dances and kicks in a stairwell, lies on the floor under a metric ton of sepia filter, flips off the camera and… writes music?… while lip-syncing a heavily AutoTuned cover of Edie Brickell’s “What I Am.”

Here are the lyrics Marnie sings, for those who were distracted by her dancing:

I’m not aware of too many things

I know what I know, if you know what I mean

Philosophy is the talk on a cereal box

Religion is the smile on a dog

I’m not aware of too many things

I know what I know, if you know what I mean, d-do yeah…

The song was born the same year as the 25-year-old “Girls” characters; in 1988 it was the breakout hit for Brickell’s band, Edie Brickell & New Bohemians. Brickell released two albums with New Bohemians — but “What I Am” was their signature.

Perhaps the fast-rising Brickell, in 1988, was something of a spiritual predecessor to our “Girls.” A Los Angeles Times review of a New Bohemians performance asked whether “What I Am” reflected “[d]elusions of grandeur on Brickell’s part? A bit too much spinach, perhaps?” But the reviewer concluded:

22-year-old Brickell indeed came off as a self-assured young woman — but charmingly, not condescendingly, so. A native Texan who only began her first tour outside that state last month, Brickell seems at once both slyly insinuating and shyly guileless.
