The actress told Vanity Fair that she showed director Ivan Reitman how she would interpret the \u201cTerror Dog\u201d her character becomes at the end of the movie: \u201cI remember starting to growl and bark and gnaw on the cushions and jump around. Ivan cut the tape and said, \u2018Don\u2019t ever do that again.\u2019\u201d\n\nLast week, in the pages of Time magazine, former Montana Gov. Brian Schweitzer auditioned for the role of Democratic primary challenger to Hillary Clinton. He also decided to growl, bark and gnaw on the cushions.\n\nHe slammed his own party as \u201cpartially owned by corporate America.\u201d He suggested that President Obama \u201croll[ed] over and [got] scratched on the belly by corporations like a fat dog.\u201d He ripped Obamacare as giving \u201cyour taxpayer dollars to private insurance companies.\u201d He even reached back to Woodrow Wilson to attack Clinton: \u201cYou can\u2019t be the candidate that shakes down more money on Wall Street than anybody since, I don\u2019t know, Woodrow Wilson, and be the populist.\u201d\n\nThere may be an opening to challenge Clinton from the left, notwithstanding her stratospheric polling numbers across the Democratic Party\u2019s ideological spectrum. Some think the post-recession anger towards the one-percenters may leave her vulnerable to attacks tying her to the previous Clinton presidency, with its record of financial deregulation and expanded international trade. Even if that\u2019s not enough to deny her the nomination, a faction on the party\u2019s left flank may be inclined to breathe oxygen into a primary challenge so issues related to economic inequality will dominate the 2016 political discussion.\n\nBut Brian Schweitzer\u2019s \u201cTerror Dog\u201d approach is unlikely to exploit the opportunity.\n\nSchweitzer may fancy himself the 2016 version of Howard Dean, who shook up the 2004 primary by appearing before the Democratic National Committee and incredulously asking, \u201cWhat I want to know is why in the world the Democratic Party leadership is supporting the president's unilateral attack on Iraq?\u201d\n\nDean was trying to rally a stunned and divided party struggling to respond to a Republican commander-in-chief whose job approval ratings had soared in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks. Today\u2019s backdrop is dramatically different. A Democrat is in the White House, and Democrats remain pretty happy about that. Obama\u2019s approval among party members is generally around 80 percent.\n\nMoreover, Democratic support for Obamacare is similarly high: 76 percent. Many rank-and-file Democrats feel personally invested in defending the signature achievement of the Obama presidency. Schweitzer\u2019s introduction to primary voters as the guy who thinks Obama\u2019s biggest legacy is a fundamentally rotten sellout to special interests at best appeals to one-fifth of the primary electorate.\n\nLess obvious at first glance, but potentially revealing, is his animus toward the man who brought the early 20th century progressive wave to the Democratic Party: Woodrow Wilson.\n\nSchweitzer\u2019s knock on the 28th president last week was not his first. In a January interview with Slate he used Wilson in his attack on Obama: \u201cI called [Obama] a corporatist. He seems to be OK transferring taxpayer dollars into pharmaceutical companies\u2019 pockets. He\u2019s certainly OK transferring them into the military-industrial complex\u2019s pockets. He\u2019s not unlike Woodrow Wilson, who was the last really big Democratic corporatist.\u201d\n\nThis is the stuff of cranks, and often right-wing cranks at that.\n\nThere are three empty charges of corporatism thrown at Wilson: He fought World War I on behalf of corporations; he fused corporations with government to prosecute the war; and he created the Federal Reserve at the behest of bankers.\n\nThe claim that the war was fought to line the pockets of the \u201cmerchants of death\u201d was popularized in the mid-1930s by Republican isolationist Sen. Gerald Nye, who led a series of hearings designed to make that case, but failed to uncover much evidence. Further, the accusation ignores that Wilson resisted entering the war for years, and only relented after learning Germany had proposed a military alliance with Mexico with the enticement of American territory upon victory. (As detailed in the book \u201cThose Angry Days,\u201d Nye also hurled anti-Semitic charges at Hollywood film executives in the run-up to World War II. And his immediate reaction to Pearl Harbor was \u201cIt sounds terribly fishy to me.\u201d)\n\nThe specious argument that Wilson tried to use the war to advance a corporatist ideology recurs every decade or so; it was advanced recently by \u201cLiberal Fascism\u201d author Jonah Goldberg. The argument ignores the fact that Wilson faced world war without a significant standing military. If the nationalization of industry were his ultimate goal, he would have fought to maintain it after the war was over, but he did not.\n\nFinally, there is the matter of the Federal Reserve. As Ron Paul wrote in 2010: \u201cOne of the most important sectors of the economy, the banking sector, was already quasi-socialist or corporatist. The Federal Reserve, with its monopoly powers and its chairman and governors appointed by the president, has been an extra-constitutional branch of government since its creation in 1913.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s how libertarians view the central bank and the involvement of government to regulate the banking system. And yes, Woodrow Wilson had to compromise between progressives and bankers in order to get it through Congress. But Franklin D. Roosevelt had to balance those interests as well when he expanded the Federal Reserve\u2019s power over monetary policy. And no one in the Democratic Party with any political ambitions would dare call FDR a corporatist, let alone a violator of the Constitution on behalf of the banks.\n\nSo which of these baseless critiques of Wilson is Schweitzer embracing? And what does it say about his fundamental philosophy when he traffics in such shoddy history?\n\nThe reality, as I have written in the past, is that compromises with corporate interests are necessary for liberals to get legislation through Congress and advance their goals. Conservatives may want to demean any compromise advancing liberalism, and any regulation deemed acceptable by businesses, as \u201ccorporatist,\u201d but why would Schweitzer want to join them?\n\nThere may be an opening to challenge Clinton and spark a grand debate over how to tackle inequality. But Schweitzer\u2019s frontal assault on Obama only marginalizes himself in a Democratic primary. And his dubious grasp of history should give Democrats of all stripes serious pause.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Last week, in the run-up to the 30th anniversary of the release of", "title": "Schweitzer's Bizarre Strategy for Challenging Hillary Clinton | RealClearPolitics", "og": {"url": "http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2014/06/09/schweitzers_bizarre_strategy_for_challenging_hillary_clinton_122904.html", "image": "http://images.rcp.realclearpolitics.com/212412_5_.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Last week, in the run-up to the 30th anniversary of the release of", "title": "Schweitzer's Bizarre Strategy for Challenging Hillary Clinton | RealClearPolitics"}, "twitter": {"site": "@rcp_articles", "card": "summary"}, "tweetmeme-title": "Schweitzer's Bizarre Strategy for Challenging Hillary Clinton | RealClearPolitics", "fb": {"app_id": 1415921935346245}, "keywords": "Election 2016,Hillary Clinton,Brian Schweitzer,", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=1"}, "article_summary": "Brian Schweitzer auditioned for the role of Democratic primary challenger to Hillary Clinton.\nAnd yes, Woodrow Wilson had to compromise between progressives and bankers in order to get it through Congress.\nLess obvious at first glance, but potentially revealing, is his animus toward the man who brought the early 20th century progressive wave to the Democratic Party: Woodrow Wilson.\nBut Schweitzer\u2019s frontal assault on Obama only marginalizes himself in a Democratic primary.\n(As detailed in the book \u201cThose Angry Days,\u201d Nye also hurled anti-Semitic charges at Hollywood film executives in the run-up to World War II."}
