Having apparently run out of George W. Bush excuses for his own failures, President Barack Obama blamed the public’s distrust in government — especially the federal government — on the late President Ronald W. Reagan.

Obama acolyte and MSNBC “Hardball” host Chris Matthews asked the president what the source of America’s distrust in government was. Obama was all too willing to answer, according to IJ Review.

“We’ve had a politics, frankly, you know, the entire Republican Party brand since Ronald Reagan has been ‘government’s the problem,’” the president said. “And if you, day after day, week after week, election after election, are running on that platform and that permeates our culture and it’s picked up by, you know, ordinary citizens who grow skeptical, then it’s not surprising that over time, trust in government declines.”

President Obama had obviously referred to Reagan’s line at his 1981 inauguration: “In this present crisis, government is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem.”

Although the majority of Americans have probably forgotten those words, there are plenty of examples that “government is the problem” without excoriating a dead president.

We have “Cash for Clunkers,” Operation Fast and Furious, the IRS targeting of conservatives scandal, the Department of Justice targeting of the press, the Benghazi debacle and, of course, Obamacare.

The president doesn’t need to parade out a 32-year-old quote to show why the people believe government is the problem — he has only to look to his own administration.
