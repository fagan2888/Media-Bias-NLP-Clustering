I'm with Kamin on this, for reasons I explained here. My Reboot colleague Madeleine Doubek disagrees emphatically. She says this is exactly the kind of extravagant spending that shows state government has no grasp of its dire fiscal condition. Whose side are you on? Take our poll and cast your vote here. Then explain in the comments section.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn case you missed it, there's more expensive work going on at the Capitol complex in Springfield, including an extensive renovation and modernization of the Illinois Supreme Court.

We uncover 5 in our fifth installment of our Fun Facts series on the gubernatorial candidates. Click here!\n\nPENSION PERSPECTIVE Economist and author John Mauldin starts his dissection of the Illinois pension crisis with this quote from economist Thomas Sowell: \"It is hard to imagine a more stupid or more dangerous way of making decisions than by putting those decisions in the hands of people who pay no price for being wrong.\" That sets the tone for Mauldin's thorough analysis of how Illinois got into its pension quagmire. It's definitely worth reading.\n\n\n\nSOUND OFF FOR PENSION REFORM Mauldin's analysis is more evidence for the obvious: Illinois has to reform its pension system or face dire consequences across its economy for decades to come. The special conference committee on pension reform is expected to introduce its compromise bill any day now. We understand the need for compromise, but lawmakers need to understand the long-term harm that will be done if they don't get this right. Use our Sound Off tool took keep the pressure on for a bill that both protects retirement security for public employees and allows the state to turn its finances around. It's easy and effective.

We chart the history of Illinois and its neighbors on minimum wage in this infographic.\n\nLOSING JOBS Gov. Pat Quinn has made raising the minimum wage part of his reelection campaign. We think this will do more to reduce the number of minimum-wage jobs available than to help those already working minimum wage jobs. You can use our Sound Off tool to send that message to Quinn, your state legislators and the four leaders of the General Assembly. You can use our message or create your own.
