That was just days after another man killed three people in a women\u2019s health clinic in Colorado. Both incidents appear to be religiously motivated terrorism. Both crimes were committed with assault weapons.\n\nNevertheless, on Monday, Justice Clarence Thomas handed down an opinion arguing that America needs to allow greater access to assault rifles. The opinion concerned a Highland Park, Illinois, ordinance which \u201cbans manufacturing, selling, giving, lending, acquiring, or possessing\u201d certain kinds of assault rifles. Though the full Court decided not to hear a challenge to an appeals court decision upholding this ordinance, Thomas wanted to take the case and hold that the ordinance violates the Second Amendment. Only Justice Antonin Scalia joined Thomas\u2019s opinion.\n\nHad Thomas\u2019s view prevailed, it could have set off a cycle that gradually made virtually any restrictions on the types of firearms owned by civilians unconstitutional. Noting that assault rifles owned by a large number of gun owners, and that the \u201coverwhelming majority of citizens who own and use such rifles do so for lawful purposes, including self-defense and target shooting,\u201d Thomas claims that nothing else is necessary to hold that these guns are constitutionally protected.\n\nThis is not a frivolous argument, at least under existing precedent. Though the Court\u2019s landmark opinion in District of Columbia v. Heller does permit bans on \u201cdangerous and unusual\u201d weapons, it also does contain language suggesting that a weapon gains more constitutional protection as it enters more common use. Taken to its logical end, however, Thomas\u2019s rule could lead to absurd results.\n\nSuppose, for example, that an unusually conservative Congress is elected in 2016, and that Congress repeals the ban on machine guns. All that would be necessary under Thomas\u2019s rule to render such a ban permanently unconstitutional would be for a large number of gun owners to obtain machine guns and not use them in the commission of a crime. The NRA and gun manufacturers, moreover, would have an obvious interest in ensuring that these guns become commonly held as quickly as possible \u2014 as they would be in a literal arms race to distribute the guns widely before Congress can reinstate the ban.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Had Thomas's view prevailed, it could have set off a cycle that gradually made virtually any restrictions on the types of firearms owned by civilians unconstitutional.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "Had Thomas's view prevailed, it could have set off a cycle that gradually made virtually any restrictions on the types of firearms owned by civilians unconstitutional.", "title": "Justice Thomas Picked Today, Of All Days, To Call For More Access To Assault Rifles", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2015/12/07/3729036/justice-thomas-picked-today-of-all-days-to-call-for-more-access-to-assault-rifles/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/clarence-thomas.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Had Thomas's view prevailed, it could have set off a cycle that gradually made virtually any restrictions on the types of firearms owned by civilians unconstitutional.", "creator": "@imillhiser", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/clarence-thomas-321x214.jpg", "title": "Justice Thomas Picked Today, Of All Days, To Call For More Access To Assault Rifles", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-justice", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/clarence-thomas.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/clarence-thomas.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-07T11:14:54+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/IanMillhiserPublic"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "Justice Justice Thomas Picked Today, Of All Days, To Call For More Access To Assault Rifles CREDIT: AP Photo/Michael DwyerLast Wednesday, a married couple walked into a facility for the developmentally disabled and murdered more than a dozen people.\nNevertheless, on Monday, Justice Clarence Thomas handed down an opinion arguing that America needs to allow greater access to assault rifles.\nThe opinion concerned a Highland Park, Illinois, ordinance which \u201cbans manufacturing, selling, giving, lending, acquiring, or possessing\u201d certain kinds of assault rifles.\nOnly Justice Antonin Scalia joined Thomas\u2019s opinion.\nThough the full Court decided not to hear a challenge to an appeals court decision upholding this ordinance, Thomas wanted to take the case and hold that the ordinance violates the Second Amendment."}
