Cordes\n\nWorld-Herald staff writer\n\nWhen Victor Lee, the CEO of Boone County Health Center in Albion, Nebraska, looks over the vast landscape of health care in rural America, he sees alarming trends.\n\nDozens of rural hospitals across the country have recently closed, including one in Nebraska. His own books show declining margins, falling federal reimbursements and ever-growing amounts of care delivered to patients with no health insurance or ability to pay.\n\nUnless something is done, Lee sees a bleak outlook for health care in the heartland.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been in this business 45 years,\u201d he said, \u201cand this last year is the most dire I\u2019ve seen.\u201d\n\nRural health advocates warn a crisis is rising across the nation\u2019s countryside \u2014 one with the potential to ratchet up the Statehouse debate over whether to expand Medicaid to cover more low-income, uninsured Nebraskans.\n\nNationwide since 2010, 68 rural hospitals have closed, the pace accelerating with each year. A recent study by a health care finance consultant also identified hundreds of other rural hospitals it said are in danger of closing \u2014 a list that includes 15 in Nebraska.\n\nAnd the vast majority of hospitals that have closed or are on the critical list are in states that haven\u2019t expanded Medicaid. Some rural health advocates say it\u2019s time for Nebraska to join the 31 other states that have partnered with the federal government to extend the program to more of the uninsured.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the map, you can\u2019t deny where hospitals have closed and where there\u2019s great vulnerability of more closing, those are the states that didn\u2019t expand Medicaid,\u201d said Maggie Elehwany of the National Rural Health Association.\n\nBut Gov. Pete Ricketts and his administration say Medicaid expansion would be a bad idea for rural Nebraska and the entire state, putting state finances at \u201chuge financial risk.\u201d He said he\u2019d prefer to explore other, less expensive options that would both stabilize funding for rural hospitals and help people who lack insurance.\n\n\u201cI think everyone would agree there\u2019s an issue here,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cThe path people are taking with Medicaid expansion is the wrong one.\u201d\n\nThe issue of whether Nebraska should expand Medicaid has long been politically charged, in large part driven by strong and entrenched feelings over President Barack Obama\u2019s controversial health care law.\n\nBut behind the heated politics are some staggering numbers and weighty issues. Virtually everyone in Nebraska is affected, regardless of whether they\u2019re among the estimated 100,000 low-income Nebraskans \u2014 most of them in the ranks of the working poor \u2014 who could gain insurance under the expansion bill pending in the Legislature.\n\nOne issue that has received scant attention in the debate has been the relative health of health care in Nebraska\u2019s small towns.\n\nBoth sides agree: The current financial state of rural hospitals is much broader than Medicaid expansion. The recent closings have been driven by a mix of falling rural populations, fundamental changes in health care delivery and changes in federal financing for hospitals.\n\nBut expansion advocates say Medicaid expansion can\u2019t be overlooked as a factor, particularly with the strong correlation between hospital closures and whether states have expanded the program. Nearly three-fourths of the recent rural hospital closures have been in the 19 states that haven\u2019t expanded Medicaid.\n\nThe recent study by health care consultant iVantage Health Analytics found a similar correlation: 35 percent of hospitals in nonexpansion states were vulnerable to closing, compared with 20 percent in expansion states.\n\niVantage\u2019s report and the rural health association also cite a direct link between the declining hospital revenues and Medicaid expansion.\n\nCongress earlier this decade slashed federal payments to hospitals for caring for the indigent and uninsured. Part of the thinking was that hospitals would make up the money by seeing more insured patients under Obamacare, including the program\u2019s expansion of Medicaid. But because Nebraska didn\u2019t expand Medicaid, its hospitals have faced the federal cuts but haven\u2019t seen the influx of insured patients \u2014 directly impacting their bottom lines.\n\n\u201cWe got all the cuts but we didn\u2019t get any of the gravy,\u201d said Marty Fattig, CEO of Nemaha County Hospital in Auburn.\n\nThe issue of expanding health insurance coverage is arguably bigger in small-town Nebraska than in the rest of the state.\n\nNot only are some rural hospitals troubled financially, Nebraska\u2019s rural counties also have the state\u2019s highest rates of residents without insurance \u2014 the broader problem Obamacare was intended to help solve.\n\nOf the 37 Nebraska counties with the highest rates of uninsured, 32 are rural, according to data from the University of Nebraska at Omaha\u2019s Center for Public Affairs Research. In all, 13.6 percent of rural residents lack insurance, compared with 12.3 percent in Nebraska\u2019s metro areas.\n\nDespite that, the opposition to Medicaid expansion is most strong in Nebraska\u2019s rural areas.\n\nOf those 32 highest-uninsured rural counties, almost three-fourths are represented by state senators who a year ago helped kill a Medicaid expansion bill. Outside Nebraska\u2019s metro areas, opponents of expansion outnumbered supporters on that vote more than two to one.\n\nState Sen. Al Davis of Hyannis, who supported Medicaid expansion last year but is still weighing this year\u2019s bill, said there\u2019s no doubt many rural constituents strongly oppose expansion. \u201cIt\u2019s anathema to a lot of people,\u201d he said.\n\nSen. Ken Schilz of Ogallala represents eight of the counties with the highest uninsurance rates. He said he\u2019s sympathetic to those without insurance. But he said he shares the governor\u2019s long-term concerns about paying for it, especially if the federal government ultimately backs out of paying for the bulk of the program.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a tough one to figure out how to (help the uninsured) and be fiscally responsible for everything else,\u201d he said.\n\nRural health care advocates say maintaining hospitals is critical for both the physical and economic health of small towns. Public funding from government health care programs has long been key to rural hospitals\u2019 survival.\n\nAfter a rash of rural hospital closings during the 1980s and 1990s, Congress helped put in place a financial safety net.\n\nMany rural hospitals, including 64 in Nebraska and 82 in Iowa, gained status as \u201ccritical access hospitals.\u201d That made them eligible for more generous federal reimbursement rates under Medicare, the federal health care program for the elderly. Other special federal payment programs for rural hospitals were also created, all intended to help them keep their doors open.\n\nBut that financial safety net appears to be fraying.\n\nRural hospital closures have escalated rapidly in recent years, from just three in 2010 to 18 last year. There have already been four closures through the first two months of 2016.\n\nBy far the most have been in the South: 10 in Texas, six in Tennessee and five each in Alabama and Georgia. But there have also been growing numbers in the Great Plains, including two each in Kansas, Minnesota and Missouri and one each in Nebraska and South Dakota.\n\nThe hospital in Tilden, Nebraska \u2014 a critical access hospital \u2014 joined the list in June 2014 after years of struggles.\n\nThe hospital in Norfolk stepped in and established an outpatient clinic in Tilden, hiring about half the hospital\u2019s former workers. But the closure still cost Tilden about 35 good-paying jobs as well as local in-patient and emergency room service.\n\nThe rural closures to date could be just the beginning.\n\niVantage, which specializes in rural health, last month compared the financial performance of the nation\u2019s 2,100 rural hospitals with those that have already closed. It determined some 673 hospitals \u2014 employing nearly 100,000 workers \u2014 shared similar characteristics to the closed hospitals and were thus vulnerable. That was up from 283 in a similar analysis two years earlier.\n\n\u201cRural hospitals have not nearly seen the worst of this yet,\u201d said Michael Topchik, who heads the rural health division at iVantage. \u201cWe really do see a crisis mounting.\u201d\n\nTopchik declined to identity the 15 Nebraska hospitals found to be vulnerable. His company shares its data with the hospitals but doesn\u2019t release it publicly, for fear of harming the facilities.\n\nTopchik and rural health officials cite a number of factors behind the critical state of many rural hospitals.\n\nThere have been declining patient numbers due to both general population decline and shifts in health care to more outpatient care. Rural hospitals also can\u2019t take advantage of economies of scale and often aren\u2019t big enough to engage in more lucrative specialty services, in Nebraska often sending such patients to bigger facilities in Omaha and Lincoln.\n\nHowever, rural health officials say the problems also directly relate to federal and state policy.\n\nSince 2013, the federal \u201csequester\u201d budget cuts have reduced payments under Medicare by 2 percent. Those cuts especially hit rural hospitals, which generally serve older and sicker populations than those in cities.\n\nAdditionally, Congress in 2012 cut the amount of reimbursements to hospitals for providing free care to the poor and uninsured, often referred to as \u201ccharity care\u201d or \u201cbad debt.\u201d Those cuts were particularly deep for rural hospitals, with their federal dollars in that program cut by a third. The cuts were justified by the new business the hospitals would see through Obamacare and Medicaid expansion.\n\nWhat no one anticipated was the subsequent U.S. Supreme Court decision in 2012 that made participation in Medicaid expansion optional for states.\n\nAs states took up the issue, it became highly politicized and partisan. Democratic governors largely embraced expansion. Most Republicans, including Ricketts and his predecessor Gov. Dave Heineman, fought it, spurning the billions of dollars of federal funds the program offered to help cover the poor.\n\nNebraska declined almost $1 billion during the first three years of the program, when the federal government provided 100 percent of the funding. States will be required to pick up 10 percent of the cost by 2021.\n\nToday, the remaining nonexpansion states are largely located in the South and Great Plains \u2014 the same places hospitals are now most troubled.\n\nIn the iVantage study, 21 percent of Nebraska\u2019s rural hospitals were seen as vulnerable. That compared with 14 percent in Iowa and 20 percent in Colorado, the two neighboring states that have expanded Medicaid.\n\nIn the four adjacent states that haven\u2019t expanded Medicaid, vulnerable hospitals numbered 48 percent in Missouri, 36 percent in South Dakota, 29 percent in Kansas and 14 percent in Wyoming.\n\nTopchik said he thinks the federal cuts and states\u2019 decisions not to expand Medicaid are now catching up to many rural hospitals. \u201cThere\u2019s no question expanding Medicaid is an important safety net for rural providers,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvocates for rural hospitals are now calling on Congress to restore the sequester cuts as well as urging the remaining states to expand Medicaid.\n\nIn the Nebraska Legislature, supporters are taking a different approach to Medicaid expansion this year, with a new \u201cprivate option\u2019\u2019 modeled on Arkansas\u2019 program. Rather than adding more low-income uninsured to the Medicaid rolls, the bill would use the federal dollars to help the uninsured buy private insurance.\n\nBut the biggest barrier remains the cost to the state, estimated by the Legislature\u2019s fiscal staff to be about $22 million a year over the next five years. Ricketts warns the costs would go much higher if the federal government ever backs away from its pledge to fund 90 percent of the program.\n\nNow the issue of rural hospital closings could add fuel to the debate. Lee, the Albion hospital administrator, said his hospital isn\u2019t in any imminent danger of closing. But he said if Ricketts and the Legislature don\u2019t move to expand Medicaid, he has little doubt the state will see more closures.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the governor fully understands the ramifications, and if he does he doesn\u2019t care or doesn\u2019t believe it,\u201d Lee said. \u201cBut it\u2019s real. A lot of people in rural Nebraska are going to lose access to health care.\u201d\n\nRicketts said he has certainly spoken with rural hospital administrators who say Medicaid expansion would help their facilities, but he has also heard from some who oppose it. He said he\u2019d welcome the chance to sit down with rural hospital leaders to explore solutions to their finance concerns.\n\nHe said he\u2019s also hoping a change of administration in Washington next year will allow the states to pursue more flexible ways to help the uninsured besides expanding Medicaid.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m always willing to look at how we can do a better job in all our programs,\u201d he said.\n\nCalder Lynch, tabbed by Ricketts last year as Medicaid director in the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services, said there are ways Nebraska could help rural hospitals within the regular Medicaid program, such as enhanced reimbursements for telemedicine and other remotely provided care.\n\n\u201cAccess to health care in rural communities is very important to us,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d invite any health care provider to come to the table and talk about other ways to create more sustainable funding streams.\u201d\n\nFattig, the Auburn hospital administrator, said no one should lose track of the people at the center of the debate: those who have no insurance, often through no fault of their own. Contrary to what some suggest, he said, most of those who would be helped are working people who simply don\u2019t make enough money to afford insurance \u2014 and their health and finances suffer for it.\n\nHe cited the case of a young woman locally who worked three part-time jobs but took home a modest income. She was not eligible for traditional Medicaid but not making enough to qualify for Obamacare subsidies to buy her own insurance.\n\nOne summer evening, the woman fell off a balcony and landed on her head and neck. Because she knew she couldn\u2019t pay, she initially didn\u2019t go to the hospital.\n\nWhen Fattig\u2019s wife ran into the woman downtown and saw her swollen neck and obvious pain, she insisted the woman seek care. A scan at Fattig\u2019s hospital showed the woman had broken a bone in her neck.\n\nFattig said his hospital through its charity care program was able to stabilize her with a cervical collar and prescribed medications. But a specialist in Lincoln declined to see her because she lacked insurance. She\u2019s doing OK now, Fattig said, but he worries about her long-term health.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s right about that?\u201d he said of her story. \u201cIn my opinion, that\u2019s the kind of person we need to cover.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"url": "http://lexch.com/news/regional/rural-health-care-in-critical-condition/article_44f10040-e580-11e5-aebf-6fe3d259434a.html", "type": "article", "site_name": "Lexington Clipper-Herald", "description": "By Henry J.
