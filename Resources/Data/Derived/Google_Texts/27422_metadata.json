Republicans and Democrats will never agree on a way to replace No Child Left Behind, they said. But a new Senate that\u2019s back to work is proving them wrong,\u201d Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said before the vote.\n\nOut of the 17 votes against the measure, 14 were from Republicans, with three Democrats joining them in opposition.\n\n17 no votes on renewing No Child Left Behind. 14 R\u2019s: Crapo Cruz Daines Flake Lee Moran Murphy Paul Risch Rubio Sasse Scott Shelby Vitter \u2014 Chad Pergram (@ChadPergram) July 16, 2015\n\nThe House and Senate now must reconcile its bills before the president has a chance to sign off.\n\nCo-sponsors Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., and Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., will have a tough sell in conference.\n\nThe House version includes a Republican-backed provision allowing federal money to follow low-income children to public schools of their choice.\n\nDemocrats contend this \u201cportability\u201d measure, as it\u2019s known, pulls funding from areas that need it most, aggravating inequalities in poor school districts. The White House has already threatened to veto any legislation including portability.\n\nThe Senate stripped a similar provision from its bill to pull enough Democratic support.\n\nLindsey Burke, an expert in education for The Heritage Foundation, said both rewrites are \u201cmissed opportunities\u201d to restore state and local control in education policy.\n\n\u201cThe Senate version sets the stage for increasing in spending in the next few years, and provides no options whatsoever for funding portability,\u201d Burke said. \u201cThe House version provides only meager portability, with some funds following students to public schools of choice.\u201d\n\nMurray said differences need to be resolved, but downplayed potential contention.\n\n\u201cI am confident we can get this bill over the finish line,\u201d she told Reuters.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Senate Thursday passed a bipartisan rewrite of No Child Left Behind, the nation\u2019s education standards extending the federal reach into public schools.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The Senate Thursday passed a bipartisan rewrite of No Child Left Behind, the nation\u2019s education standards extending the federal reach into public schools.", "title": "Senate Passes No Child Left Behind Overhaul", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150716_SenateNCLB_Johnson.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-07-16T17:37:10+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1JkZcJu"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The Senate Thursday passed a bipartisan rewrite of No Child Left Behind, the nation\u2019s education standards extending the federal reach into public schools.", "title": "Senate Passes No Child Left Behind Overhaul", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150716_SenateNCLB_Johnson.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Education", "tag": "k-12", "published_time": "2015-07-16T16:36:41+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-16T17:37:10+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "No Child Left Behind, Every Child Achieves, Lamar Alexander, Patty Murray"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf7e4\"", "article_summary": "The Senate Thursday passed a bipartisan rewrite of No Child Left Behind, the nation\u2019s Bush-era education standards that extended the federal government\u2019s reach into U.S. public schools.\nRepublicans and Democrats will never agree on a way to replace No Child Left Behind, they said.\n17 no votes on renewing No Child Left Behind.\nThe Senate\u2019s bill would retain No Child Left Behind\u2019s extensive testing standards but gives control to states in deciding whether to use the results in measuring a school\u2019s performance.\nThe legislation passed by a 81-17 vote one week after the House voted along party lines to narrowly pass its more conservative version of No Child Left Behind."}
