Because when it comes to ObamaCare, the math is all wrong. The numbers don\u2019t add up. And somebody had better solve this equation before the whole system comes crashing down.\n\nThe sad truth about the curiously named Affordable Care Act is:\n\n\u00b7 Insurance premiums are rising;\n\nThe Affordable Care Act\u2019s goal \u2013 to provide quality health care at an affordable price to all Americans \u2013 is a noble one. But as things stand now, it is not the sum of all its parts. It just doesn\u2019t add up.\n\n\u00b7 Hospitals are having trouble staying solvent;\n\n\u00b7 Emergency room visits are up, not down;\n\n\u00b7 \u201cNarrow networks\u201d are restricting the number of quality physicians.\n\nFactor in that the Supreme Court could decide this month that states do not have to accept federal subsidies for ObamaCare patients who need them, and things could get exponentially worse in a heartbeat.\n\nHere\u2019s the sorry math. You could say it\u2019s elementary.\n\n1. Premiums are rising.\n\nThe way things are going, the Affordable Care Act may have to be renamed the \u201cCare Act,\u201d because it won\u2019t be affordable for long. Insurance companies are finally discovering the true cost of care based on the needs of people who have bought coverage. This data wasn\u2019t available when the program began, and now that it is, the insurers are asking for large hikes in their rates.\n\nThe rates were initially based on the notion that young and healthy people would sign up for health insurance, and that their participation would balance out the higher costs of older, sicker people. But that hasn\u2019t happened. Many of them are deciding they\u2019d rather pay a small tax penalty and go without health care than pay a higher amount for a plan they feel they don\u2019t need right now. It\u2019s a gamble, but they\u2019re willing to take it, and it means the insurance companies have to raise their rates to accommodate subscribers who, on average, are older and sicker than they anticipated. But when the rates go up, the penalty becomes an even more attractive alternative for the young and healthy. Add the fact that federal subsidies to states that haven't built their own health care exchanges have kept premiums in check, and it\u2019s clear that everything could spin out of control if the Supreme Court pulls the subsidies out of the equation.\n\n2. Hospitals are having trouble staying solvent\n\nAs reported last week in the Wall Street Journal, a recent study by Moody\u2019s Investors Service showed that nonprofit hospitals in the states that expanded Medicaid aren't seeing fewer unpaid bills and more paying customers, which they expected. This refutes \u201ca narrative out there that Medicaid expansion has lowered bad debt and that is driving [financial] improvements at hospitals,\u201d Moody\u2019s analyst Daniel Steingart said.\n\nYou can\u2019t provide quality care if you can\u2019t stay in business, and many hospitals are finding that the cost of accommodating an expanded pool of Medicaid patients does not make up for the decrease in reimbursements they are receiving under ObamaCare. Sure, health care is more affordable. But it won\u2019t make a difference if there\u2019s no hospital to provide it.\n\n3. Emergency Room visits are rising\n\nThe low reimbursements that accompanied the expansion of Medicaid have resulted in a shortage of primary care doctors, and that has pushed more people to visit the ER as their primary source of care.\n\n\"America has severe primary care physician shortages, and many physicians will not accept Medicaid patients because Medicaid pays so inadequately,\u201d says Dr. Michael Gerardi, president of the American College of Emergency Physicians. \"Just because people have health insurance does not mean they have access to timely medical care.\u201d\n\nObamaCare proponents expected that when more people could afford care, they would go to physicians\u2019 offices instead of the ER. It hasn\u2019t turned out that way.\n\n4. Narrow Networks Restrict the Number of Quality Physicians\n\nPresident Obama famously announced in 2009 that under the Affordable Care Act, \u201cIf you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor.\u201d He should have added, \u201cmaybe.\u201d In order to keep their costs down, health insurance companies are increasingly offering \u201cnarrow network\u201d plans that allow subscribers to visit only certain doctors and hospitals. Subscribers have had to sign up for plans that cover visits to some of their physicians, but not all of them.\n\nThis came about because the insurers did the math, and it added up to something the president promised wouldn\u2019t happen: a limited pool of physicians and medical centers \u00ad\u2013 not an improvement in care \u2013 in order to keep the insurers\u2019 costs in check.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act\u2019s goal \u2013 to provide quality health care at an affordable price to all Americans \u2013 is a noble one. But as things stand now, it is not the sum of all its parts. It just doesn\u2019t add up. And like a car heading too fast toward a sharp curve on a wet road, it\u2019s going to spin out of control unless someone hits the brakes, and fast.\n\nNoble goals deserve noble outcomes.
