James Lankford, R-Oklahoma, to attend Tuesday\u2019s State of the Union address in Washington, D.C.\n\nLankford\u2019s office made the announcement Tuesday, one week before President Barack Obama is set to address both houses of Congress. Lankford said he chose Piper because of OKWU\u2019s continued stance for religious freedom in the United States.\n\n\u201cIt is my honor to have Dr. Everett Piper as my guest for this upcoming State of the Union address,\u201d Lankford said. \u201cOklahoma Wesleyan University is a leader in the national struggle to protect the constitutional right of religious liberty in the United States. Their stand for freedom before the Supreme Court will bring clarity to our personal liberties and the battle between religious freedom and religious suppression.\u201d\n\nPiper said he accepted Lankford\u2019s invitation to attend next Tuesday\u2019s address, and will be travelling to Washington to witness what he called a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.\n\n\u201cI am humbled and honored that the senator has extended his invitation to me to attend the State of the Union address,\u201d Piper said. \u201cI graciously accepted the invitation, and appreciate Sen. Lankford\u2019s continued fight to protect religious freedom in our country. Oklahoma Wesleyan University is in the forefront of this and we join Sen. Lankford in fighting for what is right.\u201d\n\nAccording to Lankford, the fight to protect religious freedom continues. He has long been an opponent of the Affordable Care Act, and the mandates attached that say health providers must supply certain forms of birth control \u2014 including prescription drugs that induce abortion. In August, Lankford introduced the Health Care Conscience Rights Act, a bill that he said would ensure that organizations, private businesses, institutions of higher education, health care providers, and insurance companies are not forced to sponsor insurance coverage that violates their religious or moral beliefs.\n\nPiper has been president of OKWU since 2002. Under his administration, OWKU joined with several other private Christian universities and charities in suing the Obama administration to determine whether the Religious Freedom Restoration Act provides protection against the ACA\u2019s mandates on contraception. The U.S. Supreme Court is expected to hear arguments this session to determine if those mandates to nonprofit and religious institutions are constitutional.\n\n\u201cInstead of allowing diversity of thought and practice, the Obama administration demands conformity to their religious worldview,\u201d Lankford said. \u201cI applaud Dr. Piper\u2019s stand for religious freedom, and I remain hopeful that the Courts will rule in favor of religious diversity and practice. Freedom of religious practice is an essential right for every citizen. Americans have the right to choose no faith at all, or to practice a faith and live their faith free of government suppression.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Oklahoma Wesleyan University President Dr. Everett Piper has been invited by Sen.
