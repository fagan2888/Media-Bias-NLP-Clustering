Most were reading amendments, lost in whispered conversations or staring at their smart phones.\n\nBut when a demure woman in glasses and a pastel sweater began speaking into the microphone, the room fell silent.\n\n\u201cGood morning, everyone. My name is Linda Mautner and I\u2019m a surgical nurse in the Palm Beach County area. And I\u2019m also the mother of Ian Mautner, who took his life by diving off of I-95 in Boynton Beach.\u201d\n\nShe continued\u2026\n\n\u201cNormally, I would be coming up here this year to my son\u2019s graduation for the university here, FSU. It seems like everything happened very suddenly. My son became addicted to Kratom at 17-years-old, the summer of his junior year.\u201d\n\nMautner blames her son\u2019s death on Kratom addiction and she wants it banned. Her champion is Democratic Representative Kristin Jacobs of Coconut Creek .\n\nJacobs tried to make Kratom possession a felony last year. She changed that to a misdemeanor this year in hopes of winning more votes. But Jacobs says Kratom is a dangerous drug, and addicted newborns are showing up in hospitals in her district.\n\n\u201cThe very same people who brought you bath salts have come up with a very clever way to package and distribute this drug across our country and throughout the state of Florida.\u201d\n\nBut Kratom defenders are just as passionate and they have heart breaking stories of their own. Susan Ash, founder of the American Kratom Association, considers it a lifesaver.\n\nAsh says she was suffering from undiagnosed Lyme disease, racked with pain, addicted to prescription drugs and unable to function until someone in a support group told her to try Kratom.\n\n\u201cIn 2008 and in my late 30s, I was so ill, I had to move back home to live with my parents. When my friends were going out and getting married and having children. I was reduced to a mostly homebound existence.\u201d\n\nKratom is a safe alternative for narcotics and eases withdraw, says Elizabeth Gardner, an attorney with a private practice in South Florida who worked as a public defender. It\u2019s saving lives, not destroying them, Gardner says.\n\n\u201cThere are significant amount of people that I\u2019ve represented who have maintained sobriety by treating their pain with this tea. This is a tea. It\u2019s not a drug.\u201d\n\nAccording to a staff analysis, few deaths have been linked to Kratom, but it has been associated with seizures and respiratory depression. The Army and the Navy have banned it and the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration considers it as a drug and chemical of concern.\n\nBroward and Palm Beach counties tried, but failed, to pass Kratom bans. Sarasota County regulates its sale. Attempts to ban and regulate Kratom have been stymied by lack of scientific research.\n\nBut until he\u2019s convinced otherwise, conservative Republican Charles Van Zant says he will consider Kratom a threat to society.\n\n\u201cFor those of you who gave testimony today who have lost your lives today to Kratom, I hope sincerely that what our committee does today and our decision, will help you get your lives back.\u201d\n\nThe bill has two more stops before reaching the floor.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"category": "HNF Stories", "description": "After listening to tearful testimony from people for and against, a House committee voted Wednesday to ban Kratom (CRAY-tum) in Florida.", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://health.wusf.usf.edu/post/panel-bans-kratom-tearful-testimony", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/shared/npr/styles/medium/nprshared/201602/465474599.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "After listening to tearful testimony from people for and against, a House committee voted Wednesday to ban Kratom (CRAY-tum) in Florida.", "title": "Panel Bans Kratom On Tearful Testimony"}, "story_id": 465474562, "twitter": {"site": "@HealthNewsFL", "card": "summary", "creator": "@HealthNewsFL"}, "author": "Jim Ash", "org_id": 390, "dc": {"title": "Panel Bans Kratom On Tearful Testimony"}, "nid": 13509, "datePublished": "2016-02-04", "keywords": "kratom, American Kratom Association, U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration", "wordCount": 721, "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2d5a\"", "article_summary": "After listening to tearful testimony from people for and against, a House committee voted Wednesday to ban Kratom (CRAY-tum) in Florida.\nJacobs tried to make Kratom possession a felony last year.\nMy son became addicted to Kratom at 17-years-old, the summer of his junior year.\u201dMautner blames her son\u2019s death on Kratom addiction and she wants it banned.\nBut Jacobs says Kratom is a dangerous drug, and addicted newborns are showing up in hospitals in her district.\n\u201cFor those of you who gave testimony today who have lost your lives today to Kratom, I hope sincerely that what our committee does today and our decision, will help you get your lives back.\u201dThe bill has two more stops before reaching the floor."}
