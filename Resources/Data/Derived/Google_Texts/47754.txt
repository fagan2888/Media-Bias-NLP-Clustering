Spotlight on …DeMarco Murray, RB, Cowboys

When: 2:25 p.m. Sunday when Dallas (5-1) hosts the New York Giants (3-3) in an NFC East game.

What’s up: DeMarco Murray has joined the legendary Jim Brown as the only NFL running backs to rush for at least 100 yards in the first six games of a season. Brown’s streak ended there. After Miami’s Knowshon Moreno took the Week 1 lead, Murray has been the NFL’s leading rusher by a wide margin since Week 2. His 785 yards are 243 better than next-best Le’Veon Bell of Pittsburgh.

Background: Murray grew up in Las Vegas, where he played against Broncos safety Quinton Carter. In his first game as a freshman at Oklahoma, Murray ran for four touchdowns in the first half. But after an injury-prone four years with the Sooners, Murray wasn’t selected by Dallas until the third round of the 2011 draft. Backs drafted ahead of him include Mark Ingram, Ryan Williams, Shane Vereen, Mikel Leshoure and Daniel Thomas.

Klis’ take: Murray’s potentially historic season — he’s on pace for 2,093 yards rushing, 12 shy of Eric Dickerson’s 30-year-old league record — began on draft day when the Cowboys overruled owner Jerry Jones by making the boring selection of guard Zack Martin instead of the entertaining choice of Johnny Football. Football games are won up front. Johnny Manziel would have enhanced the circus, but not contributed as Tony Romo’s backup QB. Martin starts alongside center Tyler Fredrickson, the Cowboys’ first-round draft pick in 2013. And left tackle Tyron Smith was their first-round pick in 2011 — the year Murray was taken in the third. Prioritizing brawn over glitz has put Murray in position for a special season.
