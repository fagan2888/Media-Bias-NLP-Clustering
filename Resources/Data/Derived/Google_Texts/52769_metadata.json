Over the past two days Republicans claimed Democrats and President Obama were unwilling to negotiate on spending levels to keep the government running for fiscal year 2014, so they shut down the government for the second time in seventeen years because a Democrat was in the White House. However, what Republicans are not telling the American people is that Senate Democrats and the President already compromised with Republican demands that spending levels be kept at austerity levels including their precious sequestration cuts despite they are killing jobs and hurting Americans.\n\nThe media has been remiss to report that Senate Democrats caved and gave Republicans the spending levels they demanded because it made better copy to cover extraneous conditions categorically unrelated to federal government spending levels. Indeed, Republicans demanded eliminating, defunding and then delaying implementation of the Affordable Care Act, a conscience clause for inhumane Christian medical providers, and an exemption that gave fanatical Christian employers religious liberty to demand their employees subject themselves to the employer\u2019s biblical prohibitions on contraception. The theocratic gifts to extremist Christians, and ideological gift to the Koch brothers, Heritage Foundation, and teabaggers are unrelated to funding the federal government for the next year, but the media and Republicans still report they had to shut down the government because of Democrats \u201cfailure to compromise.\u201d\n\nUnlike Republicans, Senate Democrats desperately wanted to keep the government operating and made an \u201cenormous compromise\u201d to avoid the Republican shutdown. The Democratic-controlled Senate agreed to funding levels that are much closer to the Republican-controlled House budget plan than they are to the Senate\u2019s 2014 budget proposal, and it is the latest in a long line of Democratic compromises over the past several years. The Senate\u2019s continuing resolution to keep the government operating set relevant funding levels at an annualized total of $986 billion that is dramatically less than the budget plan proposed by House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan. Ryan lusted for spending levels of $1.095 trillion for fiscal year 2014 that means the Democratic Senate\u2019s compromise is 10% less than the levels in the original Ryan budget. Still, it was not enough of a concession for Republicans who assert Democrats are guilty of \u201cfailing to compromise,\u201d or negotiating extraneous issues in funding the government.\n\nAmerica has a longstanding policy of not negotiating with terrorists and hostage takers, and Senate Democrats and President Obama followed the nation\u2019s policy to the letter prompting criminal Republicans to \u201cshoot the hostage;\u201d which in this case is withholding funding to keep the federal government open. Republicans followed typical criminal behavior in extracting spending levels they demanded and then feeling empowered demanded \u201cextra concessions\u201d to satisfy their funding machine and evangelical voting bloc. The problem Republicans now have to face is that although they were successful and likely ecstatic they put 800,000 federal employees out of work, closed down regulatory agencies that protect American consumers, and adversely impacted the economy, the Affordable Care Act is still the law of the land and the American people are livid Republicans cannot accept that simple fact.\n\nAccording to a Quinnipiac and PPP poll released yesterday, Americans were against a government shutdown as a way to stop the health care law from taking effect by a margin of nearly three-to one (72-22%). They are also against Republican plans to block an increase in the nation\u2019s debt limit as a way to eliminate the health law by a margin of 64-27%, and 74% disapprove of Republican terror tactics to kill the three year old healthcare law. Voters are also opposed 58-34% to Congress cutting off funding for the health care law to stop its implementation and it leads one to question why Republicans persist in claiming the American people are behind their terrorism, and why they included extraneous issues in a bill to fund the government.\n\nPresident Obama did what the mainstream media has failed to do throughout the government funding crisis and said \u201cThey\u2019ve shut down the government over an ideological crusade to deny affordable health insurance to millions of Americans.\u201d The Republican terrorists did not shut down the government over spending levels because Democrats and the President already conceded Republican austerity for the sole purpose of averting another GOP-caused crisis. The shutdown is about harming the economy and making the people suffer. The President also said \u201cRepublicans don\u2019t get to hold the economy hostage over ideological demands,\u201d but on that one point the President is wrong; Republicans are holding the economy hostage over ideology that drove their shutdown mindset. In fact, Republicans were predisposed and intent on shutting down the government or they would not have passed legislation to pay military personnel \u201cwhen\u201d they shut down the government two days before the deadline.\n\nDespite what Republicans or the media say, the shutdown is not about Democrats\u2019 \u201cfailure to compromise\u201d or \u201cunwillingness to negotiate,\u201d it is about terrorizing the American people. Even the man who most wants the government \u201cdrowned in a bathtub,\u201d Grover Norquist, complained that the President would not negotiate with Republican terrorists even though he knew well that Democrats made a supreme compromise by acquiescing to Republican funding levels to spare the people the devastation of a shutdown.\n\nThis Republican shutdown is a portent of the approaching debt limit increase meant to instill terror in the population that unless their ransom demands are met, they will refuse to raise the debt ceiling and plunge the nation, and the world\u2019s economy into a financial crisis if their demands are not met. There is no limit to the damage Republicans will inflict on the nation, its economy, and its people over ideology founded on Republicans\u2019 belief that if they cannot rule America, they will take the country down. Republicans could stop the shutdown immediately with a clean continuing resolution, but they will not for two simple reasons; the extremists will not allow it, and Republicans enjoy hurting the people.\n\nRepublicans and their teabagger cohort may hate the Affordable Care Act, but they hate the American people more and if it is not the Affordable Care Act, it will be something else because whatever Republicans are, they are America-hating terrorists first. After four-and-a-half years of covering their hate campaign against Americans, it is high time the media stops reporting Democrats won\u2019t compromise and Obama will not negotiate because every person in America knows, you cannot negotiate with terrorists whether they are teabaggers or Republicans.", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Obama did what the mainstream media has failed to do throughout the government funding crisis and said, \"They've shut down the government over an ideological crusade.\"", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Rmuse", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "President Obama did what the mainstream media has failed to do throughout the government funding crisis and said, \"They've shut down the government over an ideological crusade.\"", "title": "President Obama Went Where The Media Won't By Calling Out the GOP Threat to America", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2013/10/02/president-obama-media-calling-gop-threat-america.html", "updated_time": "2013-10-02T15:46:24+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "Featured News,Barack Obama,continuing resolution,cuts,health care law,paul ryan,Republican Party,Senate,tea party movement,White House,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,hillary clinton,bernie sanders,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "Featured News", "published_time": "2013-10-02T15:46:24+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-10-02T15:46:24+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Barack Obama, continuing resolution, cuts, health care law, paul ryan, Republican Party, Senate, tea party movement, White House"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc2ff\"", "article_summary": "The media has been remiss to report that Senate Democrats caved and gave Republicans the spending levels they demanded because it made better copy to cover extraneous conditions categorically unrelated to federal government spending levels.\nRyan lusted for spending levels of $1.095 trillion for fiscal year 2014 that means the Democratic Senate\u2019s compromise is 10% less than the levels in the original Ryan budget.\nThe Senate\u2019s continuing resolution to keep the government operating set relevant funding levels at an annualized total of $986 billion that is dramatically less than the budget plan proposed by House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan.\nRepublicans followed typical criminal behavior in extracting spending levels they demanded and then feeling empowered demanded \u201cextra concessions\u201d to satisfy their funding machine and evangelical voting bloc.\nDespite what Republicans or the media say, the shutdown is not about Democrats\u2019 \u201cfailure to compromise\u201d or \u201cunwillingness to negotiate,\u201d it is about terrorizing the American people."}
