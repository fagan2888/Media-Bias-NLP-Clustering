From DeLong\u2019s blog:\n\nJune 07, 2003\n\nTIME TO POUND MY HEAD AGAINST THE WALL ONCE AGAIN\n\n\u2026 My two cents\u2019 worth\u2013and I think it is the two cents\u2019 worth of everybody who worked for the Clinton Administration health care reform effort of 1993-1994\u2013is that Hillary Rodham Clinton needs to be kept very far away from the White House for the rest of her life. Heading up health-care reform was the only major administrative job she has ever tried to do. And she was a complete flop at it. She had neither the grasp of policy substance, the managerial skills, nor the political smarts to do the job she was then given. And she wasn\u2019t smart enough to realize that she was in over her head and had to get out of the Health Care Czar role quickly.\n\nSo when senior members of the economic team said that key senators like Daniel Patrick Moynihan would have this-and-that objection, she told them they were disloyal. When junior members of the economic team told her that the Congressional Budget Office would say such-and-such, she told them (wrongly) that her conversations with CBO head Robert Reischauer had already fixed that. When long-time senior hill staffers told her that she was making a dreadful mistake by fighting with rather than reaching out to John Breaux and Jim Cooper, she told them that they did not understand the wave of popular political support the bill would generate. And when substantive objections were raised to the plan by analysts calculating the moral hazard and adverse selection pressures it would put on the nation\u2019s health-care system\u2026\n\nHillary Rodham Clinton has already flopped as a senior administrative official in the executive branch\u2013the equivalent of an Undersecretary. Perhaps she will make a good senator. But there is no reason to think that she would be anything but an abysmal president.\n\nPosted by DeLong at June 7, 2003 10:15 PM | TrackBack", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.vdare.com/posts/ex-clinton-aide-brad-delong-on-hillarys-management-skills?page=no-campaign", "image": "https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/vdare-live/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/29093713/hillary1.jpg"}, "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "So when senior members of the economic team said that key senators like Daniel Patrick Moynihan would have this-and-that objection, she told them they were disloyal.\nHeading up health-care reform was the only major administrative job she has ever tried to do.\nBut there is no reason to think that she would be anything but an abysmal president.\nShe had neither the grasp of policy substance, the managerial skills, nor the political smarts to do the job she was then given.\nWhen junior members of the economic team told her that the Congressional Budget Office would say such-and-such, she told them (wrongly) that her conversations with CBO head Robert Reischauer had already fixed that."}
