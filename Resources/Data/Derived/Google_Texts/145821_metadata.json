Indeed, even progressive New York Times columnist Tom Edsall now concedes that Obamacare is partly to blame for working-class Americans\u2019 all-time low 27% approval rating of Democrats, which Edsall says has now nosedived to \u201cdangerous levels.\u201d\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\n\u201cWe blew it,\u201d said Harkin. \u201cWhat we did is we muddled through and wegot a system that is complex, convoluted, needs probably somecorrections and still rewards the insurance companies extensively.\u201d\n\nHarkin added, \u201cI look back and say we should have either done it the correct way or not done anything at all.\u201d\n\nSchumer agrees.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, Democrats blew the opportunity the Americanpeople gave them,\u201d Schumer said two weeks ago. \u201cWe took their mandate and put all of ourfocus on the wrong problem: health care reform.\u201d\n\nSchumer added, \u201cWe were in the middle of a recession, people were hurting and said,\u2019What about me? I\u2019m losing my job. It\u2019s not health care that bothersme.'\u201d\n\nBut now, progressives like Rep. Henry Waxman (D-CA), Rep. Steny Hoyer (D-CA), and New York Times columnist Paul Krugman are blasting Democrats who dare to speak ill of Obamacare, reports The Hill.\n\n\u201cI disagree with both of them,\u201d Waxman said about comments by fellow Democrats Schumer and Harkin. \u201cI disagree with what they said, and I can\u2019t quite see a lot of value in it\u2026I think the Democrats and Sen. Schumer ought to be proud of it.\u201d\n\nHoyer agreed, stating that \u201cmillions of Americans\u201d now benefit from Obamacare. After the White House\u2019s recent admission that it released inflated enrollment figures, the Obama administration now claims just 6.7 million people are enrolled in Obamacare, not the 8 million it previously claimed. Moreover, the administration will not say what portion of the 6.7 million are among the 5 million Americans whose plans were canceled by Obamacare which then in turn forced them enroll in Obamacare.\n\nTimes columnist Paul Krugman trashed Schumer\u2019s assessment as \u201cdeeply wrongheaded\u201d in a Thursday piece titled, \u201cDemocrats Against Reform.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf more Democrats had been willing to defend the best thing they\u2019ve done in decades, rather than run away from their own achievement and implicitly concede that the smears against health reform were right, the politics of the issue might look very different today,\u201d wrote Krugman.\n\nHowever, with embattled Obamacare architect Jonathan Gruber set to testify on Tuesday about his shocking statements about \u201cthe stupidity of the American voter\u201d and his contention that deception was essential to Obamacare\u2019s passage, it\u2019s unclear how an already unpopular law will turn public opinion around.\n\nIndeed, after four years and eight months of being the law of the land, Obamacare hit a new all-time low approval rating in the Gallup poll of just 37%. For that reason, Democrats\u2019 internecine battle over Obamacare may continue to rage on for months and years to come.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Civil War Erupting Among Democrats Over Obamacare", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Civil War Erupting Among Democrats Over Obamacare", "title": "Civil War Erupting Among Democrats Over Obamacare - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Government/2014/Congress/Senate-Democrats/schumer-grasp-AP.jpg", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2014/12/07/civil-war-erupting-among-democrats-over-obamacare/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Civil War Erupting Among Democrats Over Obamacare", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Government/2014/Congress/Senate-Democrats/schumer-grasp-AP.jpg", "title": "Civil War Erupting Among Democrats Over Obamacare - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "New York Times, Paul Krugman, Senate,Big Government,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "Senate", "published_time": "2014-12-07T06:55:00-07:00", "categories": "Big Government"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "With half of all Senate Democrats who voted for Obamacare no longer in office, top Senate Democrats Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and outgoing Tom Harkin (D-IA) have begun trashing Democrats\u2019 decision to embrace the deeply unpopular Obamacare program.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERA civil war has opened up inside the Democratic Party over Obamacare.\nFor that reason, Democrats\u2019 internecine battle over Obamacare may continue to rage on for months and years to come.\n\u201cI disagree with both of them,\u201d Waxman said about comments by fellow Democrats Schumer and Harkin.\nMoreover, the administration will not say what portion of the 6.7 million are among the 5 million Americans whose plans were canceled by Obamacare which then in turn forced them enroll in Obamacare."}
