(NEW YORK) — A federal judge on Thursday sided with the Republican-controlled House of Representatives in ruling that the Obama administration overstepped its authority in reimbursing insurers without Congressional approval under a provision of the Affordable Care Act.

U.S. District Court Judge Rosemary Collyer said Thursday that she would, however, allow the subsidy program to continue pending appeal. The ruling comes in one of numerous Republican efforts to undo the Affordable Care Act.

If the ruling is upheld, it could foil the ACA’s insurance markets, which are still struggling for stability.

The 38-page opinion notes that the Constitution dictates “no Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law,” but that the administration has paid billions to insurers for the added cost of providing coverage to millions of Americans.

House Speaker Paul Ryan called the decision “a historic win for the Constitution and the American people.”
