WAUSAU (WAOW) --Tax season can be stressful, confusing and flat out frustrating. Several organizations in Wausau will offer services to help people prepare their income taxes.

University of Wisconsin Marathon County, United Way and AARP in Wausau are working with the community to help moderate to low income people and families file taxes.

"Free tax service is very important to residents in our county," said Maiger Moua, a program director at United Way in Wausau.

Organizers say they've been offering free tax services for several years now and they help hundreds of people in Marathon County get the most out of their tax returns.

"There are many credits that low income and elderly people can receive that they might not know about but if they come in and talk to us we're able to calculate those credits for them," explained Ellen Kemnitz, an assistant professor at University of Wisconsin Marathon County.

Local tax service providers say the tax forms will look a little different this year.

"With the affordable care act we will need to ask about health insurance coverage," Kemnitz said.

They say tax payers will need to provide proof of insurance or pay up.

"If you have not had coverage, then you will have a penalty on your taxes," explained Kemnitz.

Organizers say the penalty for not having health insurance can be hundreds of dollars.

Anyone who makes less than $53,000 a year is eligible for these programs.

Organizations are all taking appointments now. Services begin February 3 and run until April.

Tax preparation services are by appointment only.
