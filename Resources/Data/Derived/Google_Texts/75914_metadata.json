Every weekday for the rest of the month, we're presenting a different tournament to determine the very best (or worst) thing in a given field. And we're doing it the way that God intended: Bracket showdowns.\n\nBracket Madness. A new bracket, every weekday of March. [ Vote now ] [ Our picks ] Follow @wirebrackets\n\nWe picked the field, but you vote for the winner. Fill out our interactive bracket, round-by-round, to determine the people's champion, then read through our choices to find out who we think is the best of the best. Each day is a new champion!\n\nHow are you supposed to sit in your office and care about important things \u2014 Ukraine, Obamacare, what movies are good, your job \u2014 when one of your most basic needs is not being met: the need to not be freezing? The need to be comfortable in your own skin, not in a self-esteem way, but in the oh-my-god-these-goodbumps-feel-like-razor-blades-growing-out-of-my-skin way. And that is why The Wire will settle, once and for all, what the best temperature of all time is. You can print out this bracket and tape it on your office fridge.\n\nThe contenders\n\n68\u00b0 F: The favored temperature of wool-wearing jerks who insist upon dressing like British people even though this is America and sometimes it gets above 60\u00b0 outside. Think of the carbon that has been dumped into the atmosphere because men are so vain they wear suits.\n\n73\u00b0 F: The ultimate mainstream temperature. The Gap of air temperatures. The Applebees of air temperatures.\n\n82\u00b0 F: When a warm breeze is actually warm.\n\nAbsolute Zero: The coldest it gets. As it approaches 0\u00b0 Kelvin, water begins to act like waves. Way cool.\n\n200 million\u00b0 Celsius: The temperature of star contained by a donut of magnets that researchers hope to build in France.\n\n30\u00b0 Kelvin: The temperature at which some metals become superconducting.\n\n100\u00b0 F: Some research indicates people murder each other less when it gets this hot outside.\n\n100\u00b0 Celsius: Water boils, which allows you to make delicious pasta dishes like these ones from Martha Stewart\u2122!\n\n32\u00b0 F: If you are a child in a warm place, this is the temperature you root for in hopes of a rare snow day.\n\n88\u00b0 F: Perfect beach temperature. Hot enough that you have motivation to get in the water, not so hot that you bake too quickly.\n\n90\u00b0 F: Excellent sunbathing temperature. Total, complete warmness.\n\n98.6\u00b0 F: How warm you are, right now. Hopefully. Maybe you should check.\n\n100.1\u00b0 F: The temperature at which you have enough of a fever to be able to stay home from school, but not enough of a fever where you will become brain damaged.\n\n140\u00b0 F: The temperature at which bacteria start to die so that you can eat chicken and not vomit.\n\n2,900\u00b0 Celsius: The temperature at which Chernobyl would have reached meltdown.\n\n10 million\u00b0 Celsius: The temperature of the Sun which, while too hot for most outdoor activities, makes life on Earth possible when kept at a safe distance.\n\nYour vote: 73\u00b0\n\nThe Wire's vote\n\nSweet 16\n\nAbsolute zero vs. 100\u00b0 C: Absolute zero is far more interesting. Winner: Absolute zero\n\n10 million\u00b0 C vs. 100.1\u00b0 F: Sure, calling in sick is great. But we need the sun to live every day. Winner: 10 million\u00b0 C\n\n200 million\u00b0 C vs 100\u00b0 F: A star on the earth's surface is far more valuable than a slightly decreased murder rate. Winner: 200 million\u00b0 C\n\n2900\u00b0 C vs. 140\u00b0 F: Think how many bacteria would have been killed in Chernobyl. Winner: 2900\u00b0 C\n\n98.6\u00b0 F vs. 82\u00b0 F: 82\u00b0 the the perfect temperature for wearing shorts. Winner: 82\u00b0\n\n88\u00b0 F vs. 68\u00b0 F: 68\u00b0 is the temperature of torture if you're sitting still in an office all day. Winner: 88\u00b0 F\n\n32\u00b0 F vs. 90\u00b0 F: Snow is beautiful, at least the first time it happens before six months of winter hell. Winner: 32\u00b0\n\n73\u00b0 vs. 30\u00b0 K: 73\u00b0 is always a crowd pleaser. Winner: 73\u00b0\n\nElite 8\n\nAbsolute zero vs. 10 million: This is essentially the critical struggle of the universe. Can the heat of stars triumph over the coldest temperature science believes to be possible? Ha ha, no. Winner: Absolute zero\n\n200 million vs. 2900\u00b0: There are some people who worry that the man-made star will result in some sort of catastrophe. That would be scary and horrible. For nuclear reactors, though, that's old hat. Winner: 2900\u00b0\n\n82\u00b0 vs. 88\u00b0: 88 is too warm, really. Winner: 82\u00b0\n\n32\u00b0 vs. 73\u00b0: We here at The Wire are pessimists, and also residents of New York City on a very cold day. So we see 32 degrees not as the beginning of freezing but the beginning of melting. And we hate Applebee's. Winner: 32\u00b0\n\nFinal Four\n\nAbsolute zero vs. 2900\u00b0: Here's where 2900's Cinderella run of destruction comes to an end. Had Chernobyl been chilled to absolute zero, no meltdown would have occurred. Think about it. Winner: Absolute zero\n\n82\u00b0 vs. 32\u00b0: We are happy it will soon be 32\u00b0 again, hopefully, but we're not idiots. 82 degrees is unquestionably better. Winner: 82\u00b0\n\nThe Championship\n\n82\u00b0 vs. Absolute zero: OK, Absolute zero is pretty cool, because of science. But it's not actually possible to reach it. Therefore, 82\u00b0 triumphs for realness.
