Wichita police have some advice for pizza delivery drivers and their employers after a driver was robbed in southeast Wichita just after midnight Sunday.

"Really for the drivers, once they arrive at an address, it's just about being aware of what's going on," said Sgt. Joe Kennedy. "What I would say is at that point, as soon as driver is robbed, make sure you call 911 right away.

"Have the officers come to that location."

It's something the victim of Sunday's robbery in the 1500 block of S Parkwood did not do, instead waiting until returning to his store after being stripped of the food and cash he was carrying, as well as his jewelry.

The driver told police arriving the Pizza Hut where he worked he was delivering food when a man came up to him, gestured that he had a gun, demanding the loot.

The victim turned it over, before the man ran away westbound with all of it.

The delivery driver was not hurt.

He told police the robber was a 6-foot-tall black man, about 150 pounds and wearing a blue jacket and blue bandanna over his face.

As far as employers are concerned, Kennedy says to be aware of where you are sending your drivers.

"Really it's up to the business to know where they're going, where they're delivering to," he said. "If it's a false number or address. I think nowadays you can pretty much Google any address."
