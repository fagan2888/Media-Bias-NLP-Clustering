You might be eligible for a refundable tax credit. Taxpayers had the option of estimating their 2014 income to see if they qualified for the credit and then having it applied in advance to the cost of the premiums.\n\nLogin required We have used your information to see if you have a subscription with us.

They use them like savings, so that will be a rude surprise for these taxpayers. And we can avoid it by having them go into the exchanges throughout the year.\"\n\nBut what about those taxpayers who don't get refunds \u0097 between 75 percent and 85 percent do, she said \u0097 or those whose refunds aren't big enough to cover what is owed if the subsidy is reduced?\n\nIn that case, \"the easiest thing is you'll have a refund the next year, and we'll take it out of the refund the next year,\" Olson said. \"It's a debt on the books. It's an assessed tax, and we can collect it for 10 years and it's just a computer offset.\"\n\nWhile her job is to take on the Internal Revenue Service where necessary, Olson said the agency's role in verifying income for people applying for the health-care subsidy has been working well. \"They have lessened the time in which they are able to give the answer to the exchange,\" she said.\n\nBut she said there needs to be more outreach and education does need to be done about the Affordable Care Act. She called on the IRS to make its website more informative by offering more examples \"so taxpayers can recognize themselves if you direct them to a page,\" she said.\n\nAs for her own role, Olson said she speaks for taxpayers, interceding in individual disputes with the IRS and pushing for tax reform. She said she understands the agency's constraints and won't propose changes that are unrealistic. \"But,\" she said, \"I'm not going to take as an answer, 'Oh, this is too heavy of a lift.' \"\n\nThere are 74 taxpayer advocates around the country \u0097 at least one in each state \u0097 who work with her, she said.\n\nTo qualify for taxpayer advocate assistance, you must show that you face a significant hardship \u0097 that the IRS is causing you economic harm, that its systems are not working or that your rights have been violated. \"That gets you through the door,\" Olson said.\n\nAsk her what challenges taxpayers face and she answers emphatically, \"Getting assistance from the IRS, getting service from the IRS.\"\n\nIn fiscal year 2013, she said, nearly four out of 10 calls to the IRS did not get through to a live person who could help. The average wait time was 17.5 minutes.\n\nGetting IRS assistance is particularly an issue, she said, when it comes to identity theft, which remains a major issue, although the number of cases has declined since the IRS put \"significant screens\" in place. When identify theft occurs, Olson said, the IRS needs to act more quickly and consistently to help victims.\n\n\"The taxpayer has already gone through an enormous amount of angst and huge inconvenience ... and we do not recognize that in our customer service to them,\" Olson said. Victims of identity theft typically speak to a different person each time they call the IRS, she complained, and \"have to explain their situation over again.\"\n\nShe said the agency should assign each case to one person who can see it all the way through.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Tulsa World", "description": "It's not too early to start thinking about the tax implications of health-care reform.", "title": "Tax advocate Nina Olson gives health-care reform tips", "url": "http://www.tulsaworld.com/business/finance/tax-advocate-nina-olson-gives-health-care-reform-tips/article_f682ec70-0d3d-5b84-8c39-2b9a784c672b.html", "image": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/tulsaworld.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/8/db/8db8b939-a5f9-5aa1-acb3-b423d38fb6a6/52df81afa0005.preview-500.jpg?resize=500%2C384", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@tulsaworld", "card": "summary"}, "description": "It's not too early to start thinking about the tax implications of health-care reform.", "fb": {"app_id": 288003941350366}, "keywords": "irs,income,olson,taxpayers,tax,health,care,advocate,taxpayer,reform,finance,business", "news_keywords": "irs,income,olson,taxpayers,tax,health,care,advocate,taxpayer,reform,finance,business"}, "article_summary": "As for her own role, Olson said she speaks for taxpayers, interceding in individual disputes with the IRS and pushing for tax reform.\nWhen identify theft occurs, Olson said, the IRS needs to act more quickly and consistently to help victims.\nWASHINGTON \u0097- It's not too early to start thinking about the tax implications of health-care reform.\n\"It may mean that they would have a reduced refund, and many taxpayers depend on their refunds for various things,\" Olson said.\nAsk her what challenges taxpayers face and she answers emphatically, \"Getting assistance from the IRS, getting service from the IRS.\""}
