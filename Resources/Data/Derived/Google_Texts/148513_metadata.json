The famed New York Giants player played three different field positions, was inducted in the team\u2019s Hall of Fame, and also managed to earn an impressive career in the broadcast booth.\n\nFor the first time since her late husband\u2019s death, Kathie Lee Gifford returned to the Today Show and dedicated a moving 8-minute tribute to him. Three characteristics she used to describe her husband, were his faith in God, his humility, and his emphasis on hard work.\n\nKathie Lee recounted how Frank grew up during the Great Depression and at times found himself reduced to eating dog food. She said this abject poverty taught him to be grateful for everything he had:\n\n\u201cHe knew what it was like to be hungry,\u201d she said. \u201cHe knew what it was like to have literally no clothes on his back\u2026.They had nothing but they had their faith.\u201d\n\nThe faith he cherished as a child, she said, molded how he lived the rest of his life.\n\n\"That remained with him for the rest of his life. He strayed from his faith on occasion but his faith never left him,\" she said. \"His world got smaller as his God got bigger and he'd want you to know that, that he died in complete peace. He knew every sin he committed was forgiven.\"\n\nKathie Lee also praised her husband for his appreciation of hard work:\n\n\u201cHe knew what hard work was,\u201d she said. \u201cHe never had an entitled moment in his life. And we will miss him so much.\u201d\n\nBy the time she finished, a tissue box appeared because neither she, her co-anchor Hoda Kotb, nor the surrounding crew seemed to be dry-eyed.\n\nShe reminded everyone, however, that his contagious joy never escaped him.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Beautiful tribute..05/26/2016 7:04:36AM EST.", "author": "Cortney O'Brien", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Beautiful tribute.", "title": "Cortney O'Brien - Kathie Lee on Husband Frank\u2019s Faith and Hard Work: \u201cHe Never Had an Entitled Moment in His Life\u201d", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/cortneyobrien/2015/08/17/kathie-lee-on-husband-franks-faith-and-hard-work-he-never-had-an-entitled-moment-in-his-life-n2039792", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2015/8/17/7.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Beautiful tribute.", "title": "Cortney O'Brien - Kathie Lee on Husband Frank\u2019s Faith and Hard Work: \u201cHe Never Had an Entitled Moment in His Life\u201d", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/cortneyobrien/2015/08/17/kathie-lee-on-husband-franks-faith-and-hard-work-he-never-had-an-entitled-moment-in-his-life-n2039792", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2015/8/17/7.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Kathie Lee on Husband Frank\u2019s Faith and Hard Work: \u201cHe Never Had an Entitled Moment in His Life\u201d, Cortney O'Brien, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc167\"", "article_summary": "Kathie Lee also praised her husband for his appreciation of hard work:\u201cHe knew what hard work was,\u201d she said.\nThree characteristics she used to describe her husband, were his faith in God, his humility, and his emphasis on hard work.\nFor the first time since her late husband\u2019s death, Kathie Lee Gifford returned to the Today Show and dedicated a moving 8-minute tribute to him.\nKathie Lee recounted how Frank grew up during the Great Depression and at times found himself reduced to eating dog food.\nHe strayed from his faith on occasion but his faith never left him,\" she said."}
