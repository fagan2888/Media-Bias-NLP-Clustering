Companies that fail to see the distinction and don\u2019t tie to the two together could be harming their own performance, according to a new study.\n\nThe study, collaboration between the University of Edinburgh, Rice University and Brunel University, says that innovation and creativity are multilevel phenomena that demand skilled leadership to maximize.\n\nMany companies, however, say they value workplace creativity, but fail to take ideas and turn them into actionable plans to improve customer service and processes, or to introduce new products to the market.\n\n\u201cWe need to better train managers to see an idea and run with it,\u201d said Jing Zhou, the Houston Endowment Professor of Management at Rice\u2019s Jones Graduate School of Business \u201cIf you wait for the idea to be ready to be implemented, it might be too late.\u201d\n\nThe study involved research conducted between 2002 and 2013. While studies into creativity and innovation have been done in the past, the purpose of this review was to integrate the two.\n\nMaking the Connection Drives Businesses Forward\n\nWhile many companies say they value employee creativity, they fail to take action on those ideas by translating them into performance. Companies that want to survive and thrive, however, need to take ideas to the next level, the study authors suggest.\n\nTraining managers to recognize good ideas and put them into action is critical, Zhu said.\n\nGoogle and 3M serve as examples of successful companies that have taken encouragement of employee creativity to a whole new level.\n\nThey have institutionalized and incentivized the concept, building it into their corporate cultures. With a willingness to also take risks, both companies have also demonstrated their ability to implement ideas and turn them into performance.\n\nThe new study follows a 2013 article by the three authors \u201cCore Knowledge Employee Creativity and Firm Performance: The Moderating Role of Riskiness Orientation, Firm Size and Realized Absorptive Capacity.\u201d\n\nPublished in Personnel Psychology, the study determined creative employees only impacted performance if the company made a concerted effort to translate creativity into action.\n\nThe current study will be published in the Journal of Management\u2019s annual review.\n\nGet Free Updates!
