Just 2 1-2 minutes earlier, he tied the mark with a 20-yard pass to Eric Decker.\n\n\u201cI really feel like it\u2019s a team accomplishment, certainly an offensive accomplishment,\u201d Manning said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of people that played roles in this.\u201d\n\nManning made the throw to Thomas and walked toward the end zone, where his teammates patted him on the head. He then took off his helmet and walking to the sideline and pumped his fist once. His teammates came out to greet him and he gave dozens of high-fives as he grinned and walked to the bench.\n\nDecker picked up the ball after Thomas dropped it and tucked it in the side of his jersey, where it remained as he walked off the field.\n\nManning entered the game with 47 TDs and his first touchdown came on a 36-yard pass to Demaryius Thomas in the second quarter. The second one was a 10-yard throw to Decker early in the fourth period.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not surprised at what Peyton does,\u201d Julius Thomas said. \u201cThe work he puts in every day, you see how he demands the best from himself. Fortunate for us, we\u2019re the beneficiaries of that.\u201d\n\nBrady set the record, which previously belonged to Manning, in 2007. Manning had established the record by throwing 49 touchdown passes in 2004.\n\n\u201cThey were able to make the big plays and we weren\u2019t able to stop them from doing that,\u201d Houston safety Shiloh Keo said.\n\nSurrounded by the best targets he\u2019s ever had, operating a turbocharged assault with a body that\u2019s much less a question mark, Manning is putting up record numbers like he did in that remarkable 2004 season.\n\nThat year, Marvin Harrison, Reggie Wayne and Brandon Stokley all topped 1,000 yards receiving. Manning established NFL records with 49 touchdown throws and a 121.1 passer rating, marks since surpassed by Brady and Aaron Rodgers (122.5).\n\nManning was the NFL\u2019s 2012 Comeback Player of the Year, showing he was every bit as good as before. He\u2019s having his best season at age 37, just two years removed from the four neck surgeries that weakened his right triceps and threatened his career. He hadn\u2019t missed a start with the Colts before 2011.\n\nLast week, Houston interim coach Wade Phillips said Manning\u2019s season was \u201cjust the best year ever of any quarterback.\u201d\n\nManning began 2013 by becoming the first quarterback since 1969 to throw for seven touchdowns in a game. Earlier this month he broke an NFL record he held with Brett Favre for most playoff appearances when he qualified for his 13th trip to the postseason.\n\nAlthough he could set several more standards this season, Manning has insisted his only concern is the Broncos\u2019 win-loss record. He wants desperately to gain home-field advantage and the top seed in the AFC playoffs again.\n\nManning finished Sunday\u2019s game with a career-high 5,211 yards passing. He is 266 from surpassing the single-season record for yards passing set by Drew Brees in 2011.\n\nManning threw 37 touchdown passes last year, which broke a franchise record of 27 set by John Elway in 1997 and tied by Jake Plummer in 2004.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAP Pro Football Writer Arnie Stapleton contributed to this story.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Manning set NFL TD passes record with 51", "title": "Manning set NFL TD passes record with 51", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/12/22/manning-set-nfl-td-passes-record-with-51/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131222__peyton-manning-close-broncos-texans-122213p1-1.jpg", "height": 408}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131222__peyton-manning-close-broncos-texans-122213p1-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-12-22T13:54:26+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T14:41:47+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca659\"", "article_summary": "HOUSTON\u2014Peyton Manning has broken Tom Brady\u2019s NFL record for most touchdown passes in a season with 51.\nAlthough he could set several more standards this season, Manning has insisted his only concern is the Broncos\u2019 win-loss record.\nEarlier this month he broke an NFL record he held with Brett Favre for most playoff appearances when he qualified for his 13th trip to the postseason.\nFortunate for us, we\u2019re the beneficiaries of that.\u201dBrady set the record, which previously belonged to Manning, in 2007.\nManning threw 37 touchdown passes last year, which broke a franchise record of 27 set by John Elway in 1997 and tied by Jake Plummer in 2004."}
