But as the new year began, many people who bought policies through the state\u2019s health insurance exchange still hadn't received their first premium bills, which must be paid by Jan. 10 to get coverage this month.\n\nJohn Calkins, a Watertown insurance agent, is among those getting calls from clients who are \u201cpanicking a little bit.\u201d He\u2019s trying to calm them down. Calkins said it\u2019s typical for there to be problems at the start of the year, when many plans start up, and insurance carriers are scrambling to get everything in order.\n\n\u201cThe first 10 days of January are notorious for this kind of issue,\u201d said Calkins, president of Bozzuto Associates. \u201cThese are not out of the ordinary in some regards. It\u2019s just even more exacerbated because of the volume.\u201d\n\nTim Tracy, a Fairfield insurance broker and president of the Connecticut Chapter of the National Association of Health Underwriters, said the current situation is worse than in previous years. While in the past brokers could easily reach people at insurance companies to work out problems, it can now take an hour of waiting on hold to reach someone, he said. Consumers are also having trouble getting through to representatives at the insurance companies, he added.\n\nKevin Counihan, CEO of Access Health CT, the state\u2019s health insurance exchange, said he\u2019s had discussions with insurers about contingency plans in case some people don\u2019t receive bills by Jan. 10, the payment deadline. But he said that hadn\u2019t yet produced anything to announce.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of obvious concern,\u201d Counihan said, noting that people have been calling Access Health\u2019s call center because they haven\u2019t gotten their bills yet. \u201cEverybody\u2019s trying to make sure they get the premium in on time.\u201d\n\nCounihan\u2019s advice for people who still haven\u2019t received a bill: \u201cWhat I would do is I\u2019d be on the phone to that health plan right away and I\u2019d be saying, \u2018What\u2019s the fastest way for me to get into your eligibility system? Do I give you a credit card? \u2026 You tell me the fastest way that I can assure that I\u2019ll be covered.\u2019\u201d\n\nThree insurers are offering plans through Access Health's individual exchange market: Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield, ConnectiCare Benefits, and HealthyCT.\n\nAnthem spokeswoman Sarah Yeager said Thursday that all of the company's bills for exchange customers had gone out. Anthem has the largest share of exchange customers.\n\nConnectiCare Benefits has already billed more than 99 percent of its approximately 8,100 exchange customers, Michelle Zettergren, the company's senior vice president and chief sales and marketing officer, said Thursday. Those who have not received a bill will get one in the next day or so, she added.\n\nHealthyCT, a new nonprofit insurer, said earlier this week that it had been regularly sending bills to people who signed up through the exchange. The company also sent reminder letters last week to people who had signed up with the company by Dec. 23 but had not paid their bills yet. Those who pay their bills after Jan. 10 will get coverage that takes effect Feb. 1. About a third of customers paid their bills by Jan. 1.\n\nBills paid, waiting for ID cards\n\nWhat about people who paid their bills but haven't yet gotten an insurance ID card?\n\nCounihan said people can ask their insurer for a temporary ID card or identification number to use when getting prescriptions filled or getting care.\n\nEach company has a different way of handling ID cards.\n\nAnthem sends out insurance cards after it receives a member's premium. If members go to the doctor before getting an ID card, the provider can call Anthem to verify coverage, which will be in effect as long as the premium has been paid. Members can also download temporary ID cards through the Anthem website.\n\nConnectiCare sends ID cards to people who are in its system, but the cards are not valid until payment is received.\n\nHealthyCT allows people who have paid their bills to print temporary ID cards through its website.\n\nBecause there can be delays in getting insurance cards, Calkins said he always advises his clients that if they need a prescription filled or a doctor\u2019s appointment just after the start of a new year, they should be prepared to pay out-of-pocket and get reimbursed later.\n\n\u201cI could\u2019ve told you back in September that the first 10 days of January are going to be horrendous, because it\u2019s the nature of the beast,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we didn\u2019t have this federal program, I would still have these same issues.\u201d\n\nCalkins said he suspects insurers will be flexible with customers whose bills don\u2019t arrive promptly, knowing they will likely face criticism -- even if it\u2019s unwarranted -- from politicians if things don\u2019t go smoothly. But he noted that backdating coverage for people could be a major administrative challenge for the carriers.\n\nWho to call\n\nAccess Health is advising people who signed up for coverage but haven\u2019t received a bill, or who have other questions about the health plan, to call their insurance company.\n\nAnthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield customers who have not received a bill can call 1-855-738-6644.\n\nConnectiCare Benefits customers who have not received a bill should call 860-674-5757 or 1-800-251-7722 (TDD/TYY Services 1-800-842-9710).\n\nHealthyCT customers who have not received a bill should call 855-458-4928.\n\nDeadlines\n\nPeople who signed up for insurance through Access Health by Dec. 23 can get coverage effective Jan. 1 if they pay their first premium bill by Jan. 10. Access Health\u2019s open enrollment period for private insurance runs through March 31, and people who qualify for Medicaid can sign up at any time during the year.\n\nAlthough most people are now required to have health insurance as part of the health law commonly known as Obamacare, those who are uninsured for fewer than three months will not face a penalty. That means that people who have not signed up for coverage yet still have time to get insurance and avoid the fine.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Health Care, Affordable Care Act, Obamacare", "original-source": "http://ctmirror.org/2014/01/02/obamacare-coverage-starts-some-ct-customers-are-still-waiting/", "og": {"site_name": "The CT Mirror", "description": "More than 34,000 state residents were slated to begin new private insurance plans Wednesday as part of the federal health law.
