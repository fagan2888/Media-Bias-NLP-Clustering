Sioux Falls, SD

Walmart and the Banquet are teaming up to gather school supplies for low-income families. The items are being collected through Walmart's Fill The Bus program, and will be passed out to children during the Banquet's Project S.O.S.

Donations are being accepted tomorrow at the West Sioux Falls Walmart from 11 a.m. until 4 p.m., and again next weekend at both East and West stores. People can drop off supplies in the cardboard school buses located at the store's entrances.

“It will help a lot of parents alleviate some of that undue stress, for the 'my kid's not going to have a backpack,' or 'my kid's not going to have pencils or pens' or something like that, and this helps them out tremendously,” Assistant Manager Chris Mason said.

Project S.O.S. Will take place on August 16th at Whittier Middle School from nine in the morning until four in the afternoon. In order to receive supplies, the child must be present, accompanied by an adult, and must have one form of identification, such as a Social Security Card, birth certificate, or passport.

We'll hear more about how this program is benefiting families tonight on KELOLAND Weekend News at 10.
