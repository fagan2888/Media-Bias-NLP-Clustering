It’s the end of an era for once high-flying businessman Eike Batista, whose crumbled financial empire is losing one of its best-known baubles.

A Rio de Janeiro court is preparing to auction some of the entrepreneur’s personal possessions next week. Among them is a Lamborghini Aventador that Batista often proudly displayed in the living room of his opulent Rio mansion.

Batista currently is standing trial on charges of insider trading related to the collapse of his oil firm, formerly known as OGX Petroleo e Gas Participacoes . He and his attorneys have repeatedly denied wrongdoing.

The Lamborghini was one of 11 vehicles seized from Batista earlier this month as guarantees to repay investors in the event he is found guilty. Authorities also took a yacht, jewelry, three jet skis and a bejeweled Faberge egg that turned out to be a fake. Under Brazilian law, items that depreciate quickly can be liquidated immediately, with the funds put into escrow until the legal outcome is known.
