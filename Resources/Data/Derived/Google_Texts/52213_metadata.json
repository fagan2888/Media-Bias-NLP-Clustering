The demonstration was part of an effort by workers at fast-food chains around the country to boost the minimum wage to $15 an hour.\n\nSeveral of the protesters went from civil picketing to locking arms and sitting in the street, preventing traffic from passing through.\n\n\u201cAt one point they were walking on both sides of Mack Avenue but they are now concentrating themselves in the eastbound lanes, they have those completely blocked off here, walking and holding up their signs,\u201d WWJ\u2019s Bill Szumanski said from above the scene in Chopper 950.\n\nPolice waited for about 30 minutes, warning the protesters they could either move on their own or face arrest.\n\n\u201cThe protesters who were sitting on Mack Avenue and refusing to move had a bit of a negotiating session between the police department and the organizers \u2014 that didn\u2019t go anywhere,\u201d Szumanski said. \u201cSo, police have now swooped in and what they have done is arrested at least 20, maybe 30 people. They\u2019re leading them away in handcuffs to the back of the squad cars.\u201d\n\nDetroit police say of the 30 people placed in handcuffs, 24 were ticketed for disorderly conduct and released. The remain six are being held because they have outstanding warrants, police said.\n\nOrganizers say the act of civil obedience was choreographed by the D15 campaign to bring more attention to the cause. Pastor W.J. Rideout, one of the protest organizers, offered no apologies for their actions.\n\n\u201cYou know, we\u2019re not afraid anything; I told the police officers and I told the corporation that,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not scared. We\u2019re here to send a message.\u201d\n\nDetroit Assistance Police Chief Steve Dolunt said there was no problem with what was otherwise a peaceful demonstration, \u201chowever, you can\u2019t block the roadway. There are people who do have jobs that have to get to work, kids that have to get to school.\u201d\n\nDolunt said the situation absolutely left police in a lurch.\n\n\u201cBecause of this, we had to pull officers away from school patrol to do this and it exacerbated the situation,\u201d he said.\n\nAuthorities said no force was used during any of the arrests and all of the protesters were compliant during the processing phase.\n\nWhen contacted by WWJ for comment, this is what a McDonald\u2019s spokesperson had to say:\n\nMcDonald\u2019s and our independent franchisees support paying our valued employees fair wages aligned with a competitive marketplace. We believe that any minimum wage increase should be implemented over time so that the impact on owners of small and medium-sized businesses \u2013 like the ones who own and operate the majority of our restaurants \u2013 is manageable. Additionally, we believe that any increase needs to be considered in a broad context, one that considers, for example, the impact of the Affordable Care Act and its definition of \u201cfull time\u201d employment, as well as the treatment, from a tax perspective, of investments made by businesses owners.\n\nIt\u2019s important to know approximately 90% of our U.S. restaurants are independently owned and operated by franchisees who set wages according to job level and local and federal laws. McDonald\u2019s does not determine wages set by our more than 3,000 U.S. franchisees.\n\nThe \u201cFight for $15\u201d campaign, which is backed financially by the Service Employees International Union and others, has gained national attention at a time when the wage gap between the poor and the rich has become a hot political issue. President Barack Obama mentioned the campaign at a Labor Day appearance in Milwaukee.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a national movement going on made up of fast food workers organizing to lift wages so they can provide for their families with pride and dignity,\u201d Obama said, as he pushed Congress to raise the minimum wage. \u201cIf I were busting my butt in the service industry and wanted an honest day\u2019s pay for an honest day\u2019s work, I\u2019d join a union,\u201d he added.\n\nMany fast-food workers do not make much more than the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour, which adds up to about $15,000 a year for 40 hours a week.\n\nKaya Moody, a 20-year-old single mother who works at a different McDonald\u2019s location in Detroit, has taken part in several protests and she admits it hasn\u2019t been an easy sell.\n\n\u201cWe always get the \u2018Do you really think you deserve $15 an hour as a fast food worker?\u2019 We get that a lot and I just feel like, who doesn\u2019t deserve $15 an hour, you know? It\u2019s a living wage. No one can survive off of $8.15 an hour, it\u2019s almost impossible,\u201d Moody told WWJ\u2019s Ron Dewey.\n\nThe protests have been going on for about two years, but organizers have kept the campaign in the spotlight by switching their tactics every few months. In the past, supporters have showed up at a McDonald\u2019s shareholder meeting and held strikes. The idea of civil disobedience arose in July when 1,300 workers held a convention in Chicago.\n\nKendall Fells, an organizing director for Fast Food Forward, said workers in a couple of dozen cities were trained to peacefully engage in civil disobedience ahead of the planned protests.\n\nTM and \u00a9 Copyright 2014 CBS Radio Inc. and its relevant subsidiaries.
