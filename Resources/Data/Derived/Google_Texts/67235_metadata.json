The report says that rather than $200 million, only $21.5 million has actually been recovered from exchanges.\n\nThe Obama administration says Slavitt was talking about funds returned from all states, including the 34 states that returned funds because they never set up their own Affordable Care Act marketplaces to begin with, according to The Hill. The House committee's report, though, argues that for states that never set up their own ACA marketplaces, the remaining balance returned to the Treasury was not a result of CMS' oversight actions, but rather the state's own decision to not establish an exchange, thus forfeiting the grants.\n\nIf CMS is properly conducting oversight of the state-based exchanges, \"the agency should be at the ready to provide timely and accurate information to Congress, especially with regard to how taxpayer dollars are spent and recovered,\" the commitee members write in their report.\n\nRepublican lawmakers have also criticized CMS' oversight of the struggling consumer operated and oriented plans, saying the agency approved loans for the small insurers despite signs of financial instability.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read the House committee's report (.pdf)\n\n- here is The Hill article\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nCMS' Andy Slavitt defends oversight of state exchanges\n\nState exchanges may turn to feds, other states to run their marketplaces\n\nSenate subcommittee blames CMS officials for funding failing CO-OPs\n\nKevin Counihan, Andy Slavitt try to ease insurers' ACA worries", "article_metadata": {"description": "House Republicans say a federal health official intentionally misled Congress when he said the government had recovered $200 million worth of state-based exchange grant money--a claim the Obama administration disputes.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthPayer", "description": "House Republicans say a federal health official intentionally misled Congress when he said the government had recovered $200 million worth of state-based exchange grant money--a claim the Obama administration disputes.", "title": "GOP: Andy Slavitt misled Congress about recovered state exchange grant money", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthpayer.com/story/gop-andy-slavitt-misled-congress-about-recovered-state-exchange-grant-money/2016-05-11", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthpayer.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "healthpayer", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "keywords": "Andy Slavitt,Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS),grants,Health Insurance Exchanges,House Committee on Energy and Commerce,Legal / Regulatory / Risk Management,oversight", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Health Insurance Exchanges,Legal / Regulatory / Risk Management"}, "article_summary": "House Republicans say a federal health official intentionally misled Congress when he said the government had recovered $200 million worth of state-based exchange grant money--a claim the Obama administration disputes.\nRepublican lawmakers have also criticized CMS' oversight of the struggling consumer operated and oriented plans, saying the agency approved loans for the small insurers despite signs of financial instability.\nThe report says that rather than $200 million, only $21.5 million has actually been recovered from exchanges.\nThe Obama administration says Slavitt was talking about funds returned from all states, including the 34 states that returned funds because they never set up their own Affordable Care Act marketplaces to begin with, according to The Hill.\nTo learn more:- read the House committee's report (.pdf)- here is The Hill articleRelated Articles:CMS' Andy Slavitt defends oversight of state exchangesState exchanges may turn to feds, other states to run their marketplacesSenate subcommittee blames CMS officials for funding failing CO-OPsKevin Counihan, Andy Slavitt try to ease insurers' ACA worries"}
