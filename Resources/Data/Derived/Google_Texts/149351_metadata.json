Maybe Miss Hawaii didn\u2019t get the memo.\n\nWhen Aloha State contestant Crystal Lee stepped to the microphone on the Atlantic City boardwalk, she apparently forgot where she was.\n\n\u201cSince Vegas is already considered the ninth island of Hawaii,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019m just so happy to have this opportunity to travel across country to represent the beautiful island of Hawaii.\u201d\n\nMuffled gasps from the Jersey crowd are heard in the background. Maybe they were thinking the same thing we were: \u201cThis ain\u2019t Vegas. That\u2019s the Atlantic Ocean behind you. Not the fountain at the Bellagio.\u201d\n\nLee\u2019s not the first pageant contestant to earn a Miss Knucklehead nod. Last year, Tinton Falls native Michelle Leonardo finished Top 10 in the Miss USA pageant but No. 1 on our list when she forgot the name of the U.S. vice president in a TV interview.\n\nCoincidentally, the Miss USA pageant was then held in \u2026 Las Vegas.", "article_metadata": {"article_author": "Star-Ledger Editorial Board", "medium": "news", "news_keywords": "atlantic-city, opinion", "title": "Knucklehead of the Week: Crystal Lee", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Knucklehead of the Week: Crystal Lee\", \"link\": \"http://www.nj.com/njvoices/index.ssf/2013/09/knucklehead_of_the_week_crysta.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://image.nj.com/home/brightcove01/width620/img/21/260701700001/201309/2337/260701700001_2647851313001_vs-52267daee4b0586a69a27611-1592194043001.jpg?pubId=260701700001\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"11192160\", \"pub_date\": \"2013-09-08T11:07:09Z\", \"author\": \"Star-Ledger Editorial Board\", \"tags\": [\"@njvoices\",\"@perspective\",\"atlantic-city\"] }", "twitter": {"description": "When Aloha State contestant Crystal Lee stepped to the microphone on the Atlantic City boardwalk, she apparently forgot where she was.", "title": "Knucklehead of the Week: Crystal Lee", "image": "http://image.nj.com/home/brightcove01/width620/img/21/260701700001/201309/2337/260701700001_2647851313001_vs-52267daee4b0586a69a27611-1592194043001.jpg?pubId=260701700001", "creator": "@NJ_Opinion", "site": "@njdotcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article_date_updated": "Sunday, September 08, 2013,  7:07 AM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"short_title\": \"\", \"image_url\": \"http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/21/260701700001/201309/2337/260701700001_2647851313001_vs-52267daee4b0586a69a27611-1592194043001.jpg?pubId=260701700001\", \"author_name\": \"njosledit\", \"author_nickname\": \"Star-Ledger Editorial Board\", \"author_id\": \"1828476\", \"source_blog_name\": \"NJ Voices\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.nj.com/njvoices/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "NJ.com", "description": "When Aloha State contestant Crystal Lee stepped to the microphone on the Atlantic City boardwalk, she apparently forgot where she was.", "title": "Knucklehead of the Week: Crystal Lee", "url": "http://www.nj.com/njvoices/index.ssf/2013/09/knucklehead_of_the_week_crysta.html", "image": "http://image.nj.com/home/brightcove01/width620/img/21/260701700001/201309/2337/260701700001_2647851313001_vs-52267daee4b0586a69a27611-1592194043001.jpg?pubId=260701700001", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "NJ.com", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/NJ.comOpinion/"}, "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Sunday, September 08, 2013,  7:05 AM", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "Description": "When Aloha State contestant Crystal Lee stepped to the microphone on the Atlantic City boardwalk, she apparently forgot where she was."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd6af3\"", "article_summary": "Last year, Tinton Falls native Michelle Leonardo finished Top 10 in the Miss USA pageant but No.\nMaybe Miss Hawaii didn\u2019t get the memo.\nCoincidentally, the Miss USA pageant was then held in \u2026 Las Vegas.\nWhen Aloha State contestant Crystal Lee stepped to the microphone on the Atlantic City boardwalk, she apparently forgot where she was.\nAtlantic City\u2019s pageant-peekers were justifiably giddy last week as the Miss America pageant rolled back into town, nine years after absconding for more sinful surroundings in Las Vegas."}
