Pat Tiberi (R-OH) convened a hearing on Tuesday that explored proposals to improve healthcare by changing the way it is treated in the federal tax code.\n\nTiberi, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health, said that members of Congress have put a lot of work into drafting tax-related polices to improve healthcare, and the hearing presented an opportunity to share them.\n\n\u201cIn addition to my colleagues from Ways and Means, I am excited to hear from those members who serve on other committees, but who have worked diligently on health-tax bills,\u201d Tiberi said. \u201cWe are committed to working through regular order and that includes hearing from all those who are working in this space.\u201d\n\nU.S. Rep. Charles Boustany (R-LA) testified about three health-tax bills that he has authored \u2013 the Small Business Healthcare Tax Relief Act, H.R. 2911; the Repeal of the ACA\u2019s Health Insurance Tax Act, H.R. 928; and the Reinvigorating Antibiotics and Diagnostic Innovation (READI) Act, H.R. 3539.\n\n\u201cToday, Americans are struggling to afford the high cost of healthcare that has been made worse by the government mandates imposed through Obamacare,\u201d Boustany said. \u201cAs a doctor, I know that limiting access to care will only drive up healthcare costs and worsen our public health. These commonsense proposals will allow for more flexibility and choice in the marketplace, reduce costs for consumers, and ensure the United States remains on the cutting edge of medical innovation.\u201d\n\nU.S. Rep. Martha McSally (R-AZ) testified about her bipartisan bill, the Halt Tax Increases on the Middle Class and Seniors Act, H.R. 3590, that would prevent a tax increase under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nA provision of the healthcare law would make out-of-pocket medical expenses that exceed 10 percent of seniors\u2019 adjusted gross income tax deductible beginning in 2017. Currently, amounts exceeding 7.5 percent are tax deductible.\n\n\u201cHealthcare costs are already high and since 2005 have risen faster than inflation every year except 2008,\u201d McSally said. \u201cAdditionally, the trend toward rising health insurance deductibles is leaving people exposed to increasing out-of-pocket costs. We should be working to reduce this burden, not making it worse, but that\u2019s not what a hidden tax hike in the Affordable Care Act would do.\u201d\n\nU.S. Rep. Adrian Smith (R-NE) testified about legislation he introduced to exempt consumers who purchased coverage through a Consumer Operated and Oriented Plan (co-op) that was later terminated from paying ACA individual mandate penalties.\n\n\u201cThe premise of my legislation is simple \u2013 regardless of one\u2019s opinion of the ACA, the facts remain: consumers were required to purchase health insurance under that law, many chose to purchase insurance through the state and federal health exchanges, and consumers in 13 states who chose co-op plans lost coverage through no fault of their own,\u201d Smith said. \u201cThose consumers who made a good faith effort to comply with the law should not be forced to pay a penalty because the plan they chose ceased operation.\u201d\n\nU.S. Rep. Kristi Noem (R-SD) testified that her Tribal Employment and Jobs Protection Act, H.R. 3080, would shield Native American tribes from the ACA employer mandate.\n\n\u201cOnly in Washington \u2013 with hastily written legislation like the Affordable Care Act \u2013 could you come up with the scenario tribes and their members now find themselves in,\u201d Noem said. \u201cTribes are being forced to offer coverage, or pay a tax penalty for not providing coverage, to people the federal government is already responsible for caring for. This unnecessarily diverts limited resources that could be used better in other areas. We owe it to tribes to provide them the certainty they need to provide for the general welfare of their members and exempt them from the employer mandate.\u201d\n\nU.S. Rep. Luke Messer (R-IN) discussed his SCHOOL Act, which would exempt schools and educational agencies from ACA\u2019s employer mandate.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard from school leaders across the sixth district of Indiana who say their school systems cannot afford the employer mandate,\u201d Messer said. \u201cOne particular superintendent said this portion of the law will cost his school system almost $1 million annually. That means classroom aides will lose their jobs, sports will be cancelled, and access to more up-to-date instructional materials will be diminished. That\u2019s not fair to our students or our teachers. The House has taken action to exempt our nation\u2019s veterans from the employer mandate. Let\u2019s protect our educators as well.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Ripon Advance", "description": "U.S. Rep.
