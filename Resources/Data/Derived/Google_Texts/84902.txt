Worried about paying for health insurance now that Obamacare has been implemented? One dating website is hoping you’ll avoid the “Obama-drama” and get a sugar daddy to cover your health insurance instead.

SeekingArrangement.com, a dating website that connects attractive young women with wealthy older men, is marketing its services on the uncertainty surrounding the Affordable Care Act. In a YouTube video released Monday, the site informs viewers that their parents and their employment aren’t the only way to get health insurance. And the site takes direct shots at HealthCare.gov, too.

“Why settle for a horrible government site that doesn’t work?” the video narrator asks, as a frustrated man chucks his computer on the ground.

And what are the benefits SeekingArrangement offers that Obamacare doesn’t? Site users won’t have to settle for a bare bones insurance plan, get to choose their own plans and won’t get screwed — by the government.

In the beginning of this year, SeekingArrangment reported that sugar baby enrollment on the site was up considerably, especially among college students looking to pay off their debt.

Watch the video. Caution: It’s a little NSFW.
