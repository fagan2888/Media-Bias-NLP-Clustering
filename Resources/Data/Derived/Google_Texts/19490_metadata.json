The 5-foot, 1-inch successful dieter has revealed her weight loss secrets that have not only helped her stay fit and slim but also beat diabetes.\n\n\"Diabetes has forced me to make exercise a part of my daily life,\" Shepherd told Forbes. \"It just really changed my entire way. I\u2019ve been eating and living, and that\u2019s actually a good thing.\"\n\nDespite her family history of type 2 diabetes, Shepherd ignored her susceptibility to the disease and kept enjoying her favorite meal: pancakes and syrup. In 2007, the TV star was formally diagnosed with pre-diabetes, but this did not deter her from eating the way she wanted to until her doctor gave her a bleak look at her future. Shepherd was told her foot would be cut off if she kept eating the way she did, and she would no longer be able to wear the high heel shoes she loved.\n\nSherri Shepherd at the 6th Annual Comedy For A Cure Benefit hosted by the Tuberous Sclerosis Alliance.

Nerve damage to the legs and feet could result in the individual not feeling pain, heat, or cold, also known as neuropathy. The other problem it can lead to is poor blood flow, which occurs when there is not enough blood flowing to the legs and feet. Poor blood circulation makes it harder for a sore or infection to heal, also known as peripheral vascular disease. These two problems may cause the patient\u2019s skin and tissue around the infection to die, becoming black and smelly, and possibly leading to an amputation.\n\nThe reality of Shepherd\u2019s condition did not sink in until doctors told the TV star she would not be around to raise her 8-year-old son, Jeffrey, if she continued to consume so much food. With the help of friends, Shepherd began to eliminate white foods such as pasta, pancakes, cereal, and anything loaded with sugar, the Daily Mail reports. Shepherd has even shared her weight battle and diabetes diagnosis with the public in her book called How to Lose Weight and Beat Diabetes (Even If You Don\u2019t Have It).\n\nNow, The View co-host has lost 20 lbs. since her major weight loss of more than 40 lbs. in August. Shepherd\u2019s weight loss secrets lie in a healthy diet and exercise. The 46-year-old avid Zumba fan admits to doing Zumba every night for the past two years whether it\u2019s a class or a DVD. She also dished to ABC News she has a fool-proof strategy to avoid overindulging at restaurants, especially during the holiday season.\n\nNEW YORK-DEC 16: TV host Sheri Shepherd attends the world premiere of \"Grudge Match\" at the Ziegfeld Theatre in New York City in 2013.

I eat before I go, cause the point is to have great conversation. So, I\u2019m already full and that helps me.\u201d\n\nThe successful dieter also reveals she keeps a healthy snack readily available in her purse for hunger pangs during the day. \u201cI always carry apples and peanut butter in my purse to give me that boost of energy to get me through the day.\u201d Shepherd\u2019s husband, Lamar Sally, also contributes to the TV star\u2019s rapid weight loss, as he does most of the cooking in the home. The couple\u2019s favorite snack is kale with saut\u00e9ed green peppers, olive oil, and garlic.\n\nAlthough Sally does most of the cooking, Shepherd still plays an active role in the kitchen. The comedian confesses to doing \u201cpush-ups against the [kitchen] counter\u201d and does lunges while doing laundry. \u201c'I have learned to turn my house into a gym,\u201d she comically admits.\n\nShepherd\u2019s weight loss has not only improved her appearance, reversed her type 2 diabetes, but has also given her so much energy to spend time with her son Jeffrey. Her low-carb, low-sugar diet, and regular exercise has allowed her to be medication free and even run races and climb the monkey bars with Jeffrey.\n\n\u201cI want to live, and I'm going to beat this thing. I feel so blessed.\"", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "sherri shepherd, the view, weight loss, weight loss secrets, diabetes, type 2 diabetes", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "The View\u2019s co-host, Sherri Shepherd, dishes out her secrets on her 66-pound weight loss and beating diabetes.", "title": "Sherri Shepherd's 66-Pound Weight Loss Secrets Revealed [PHOTOS]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/sherri-shepherds-66-pound-weight-loss-secret-i-always-carry-apples-and-peanut-butter-photos-265884", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/12/27/sherri-shepherd-samsung-hope-children-gala-cipriani-wall-street-june-11-2013-new-york-city.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The View\u2019s co-host, Sherri Shepherd, dishes out her secrets on her 66-pound weight loss and beating diabetes.", "title": "Sherri Shepherd's 66-Pound Weight Loss Secrets Revealed [PHOTOS]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/sherri-shepherds-66-pound-weight-loss-secret-i-always-carry-apples-and-peanut-butter-photos-265884", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/12/27/sherri-shepherd-samsung-hope-children-gala-cipriani-wall-street-june-11-2013-new-york-city.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/12/27/sherri-shepherd-samsung-hope-children-gala-cipriani-wall-street-june-11-2013-new-york-city.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2013-12-27T14:27:03-05:00", "modified_time": "2013-12-27T15:22:34-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "The View\u2019s co-host, Sherri Shepherd, dishes out her secrets on her 66-pound weight loss and beating diabetes."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd90f2\"", "article_summary": "Shepherd\u2019s weight loss secrets lie in a healthy diet and exercise.\nDespite her family history of type 2 diabetes, Shepherd ignored her susceptibility to the disease and kept enjoying her favorite meal: pancakes and syrup.\nShepherd\u2019s weight loss has not only improved her appearance, reversed her type 2 diabetes, but has also given her so much energy to spend time with her son Jeffrey.\nThe 5-foot, 1-inch successful dieter has revealed her weight loss secrets that have not only helped her stay fit and slim but also beat diabetes.\n\"Diabetes has forced me to make exercise a part of my daily life,\" Shepherd told Forbes."}
