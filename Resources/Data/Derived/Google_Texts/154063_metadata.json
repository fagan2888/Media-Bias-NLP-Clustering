At this moment, Publisher Robert Allbritton and other Politico executives are speaking to a massive news conference (300 RSVPs) in Brussels, Belgium, seat of the European Union, to unveil the first stage our global expansion: a European edition of Politico, launching this spring with a team of 70, as a joint venture with Brussels-based Axel Springer, Europe\u2019s largest news publisher. POLITICO Europe will be based in Berlin, with reporters in major capitals, and newsrooms and business presences in Berlin and Paris. The goal: to create the largest most influential political and policy publication on the Continent.\n\nThe takeaways: 1) The new venture bought European Voice, the dominant publication now covering the EU, and a related Paris-based global events business, DII. Both are PROFITABLE. From the release, off embargo at 7 a.m.: \u201cThe acquisition is a cornerstone of POLITICO's drive to become the leading new media publication on European politics and policy.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n2) Matthew Kaminski, a member of the Wall Street Journal Editorial Board who lived in Europe for 15 years, has been hired as Executive Editor. He will launch with 30 reporters and editors, and scale up from there. Kaminski will report to Politico co-founder and Editor-in-Chief John F. Harris, who will oversee the vision and execution of Politico\u2019s European newsroom, as chairman of the joint venture\u2019s editorial committee.\n\n3) Other leadership: Bill Nichols, Politico editor-at-large, will be the joint venture\u2019s founding editor-at-large. Florian Eder, EU correspondent for Axel Springer\u2019s Die Welt, will be a managing editor. Carrie Budoff Brown, senior White House reporter for POLITICO, will become associate editor and senior reporter. POLITICO\u2019s Gabe Brotman will oversee strategy and business development.\n\n4) The venture will include a website, POLITICO.eu; Euro versions of Playbook and Politico Pro; a weekly paper; and conferences and events in Brussels, Paris, Berlin and elsewhere. The European edition of POLITICO Pro, like its U.S. counterpart, will be a subscription policy news service covering financial services, technology, health care, energy and more.\n\n5) The owner and publisher of European Voice, Sh\u00e9h\u00e9razade Semsar-de Boiss\u00e9son, will run the new business as Managing Director. Playbook got to meet Sh\u00e9h\u00e9razade on a Brussels trip this fall. She has Europe wired, and is fun to drink wine with.\n\n--Full release. http://bit.ly/1z5OHr3 ... www.axelspringer.com/politico\n\n--PICS by Danielle Jones: John Harris and Jim VandeHei in Berlin yesterday http://bit.ly/1yzHhJS ... Robert Allbritton, on the news-conference stage in Brussels this a.m. http://bit.ly/1Iz5lod\n\nJIM VANDEHEI, Politico president and CEO, emails the staff with a Brussels dateline and the subject line, \u201cBig, Breaking Brussels News\u201d: The purchase of European Voice \u201cprovides us instant talent and presence in Brussels ? and an attractive subscriber base in the EU Parliament. ... [O]ur European operation has the same ambitions as all of us here: dominate coverage of our core areas and build a durable and profitable business to sustain great, nonpartisan journalism. ...\n\n\u201cWe are about to go on a hiring spree with the aim of locking up the top editorial and business talent in Europe. DANIELLE JONES, who is helping guide expansion for us back here, plans to keep all of you informed on every important new hire or dimension to our expansion.\u201d Text of Jim\u2019s email http://bit.ly/1AeDhR9 ... Jim speaks in Berlin yesterday (Pic by Gabe Brotman) http://bit.ly/1qui4m9\n\nBIG PICTURE: Politico Publisher Robert Allbritton put CEO VandeHei in charge of the business just over one year ago, and promised rapid change and growth. Since that day: They bought Capital New York and built largest political staff in the state; put editor Susan Glasser in charge of Washington, and expanded Politico Magazine; partnered with Axel Springer, Europe\u2019s largest news publisher; and purchased European Voice and its companion events business. Because they smartly expanded the leadership team, Editor-in-Chief John Harris will have the time and support to help guide the Euro expansion with frequent trips overseas. #globaldomination.\n\nTORTURE INTERVIEW -- \u201cMichael Hayden Is Not Sorry: The Senate report rakes Bush\u2019s former CIA director over the coals. He fires back,\u201d by Politico Magazine\u2019s Michael Hirsh: \u201cHirsh: The report concludes ... [that a]ccording to CIA records, ... no CIA officer including Directors George Tenet and Porter Goss briefed the president on the specific enhanced interrogation techniques before April 2006. Is that true?\n\n\u201cMichael Hayden: It is not. The president personally approved the waterboarding of Abu Zubaydah [in 2002]. It\u2019s in his book! What happened here is that the White House refused to give them [the Senate Intelligence Committee] White House documents based upon the separation of powers and executive privilege. That\u2019s not in their report, but all of that proves that there was dialogue was going on with the White House. What I can say is that the president never knew where the [black] sites were. That\u2019s the only fact I\u2019m aware that he didn\u2019t know.\u201d http://politi.co/1x0MM8Y\n\n--\u201cList of the 13 techniques used on detainees\u201d \u2013 AP: \u201cHere are the methods, as listed by a May 30, 2005, Justice Department memo to the CIA: 1. Abdominal Slap ... 2. Attention Grasp ... 3. Cramped Confinement ... 4. Dietary Manipulation ... 5. The Facial Hold ... 6. The Facial Slap/Insult Slap ... 7. Nudity ... 8. Stress Positions ... 9. Sleep Deprivation ... 10. Wall Standing ... 11. Walling ... 12. Waterboarding ... 13. Water Dousing.\u201d With detailed descriptions of each technique: http://bit.ly/1IyF1KZ\n\n--\u201cEx-CIA Directors: Interrogations Saved Lives\u201d \u2013 WSJ op-ed by former CIA Directors George J. Tenet, Porter J. Goss and Michael V. Hayden and former CIA Deputy Directors John E. McLaughlin, Albert M. Calland and Stephen R. Kappes: \u201cThe program was invaluable in three critical ways: It led to the capture of senior al Qaeda operatives, thereby removing them from the battlefield. It led to the disruption of terrorist plots and prevented mass casualty attacks, saving American and Allied lives. It added enormously to what we knew about al Qaeda as an organization and therefore informed our approaches on how best to attack, thwart and degrade it.\u201d http://on.wsj.com/1x0NnYj\n\nJON STEWART: \u201cThis report is the \u2018Frozen\u2019 of CIA Senate Intelligence Committee redacted torture reports. Let me go, let me go, don't hold me back ... Why do we need to see this stupid old boring CIA torture report anyway? We got to the bottom of this years ago. [Plays a 2007 clip of Pres. Bush saying \u2018This government does not torture people.'] Boom! Pow! If that famed painter of cats and feet says we didn't torture, who are we to disagree? My guess is that the Senate report is just a single piece of paper, saying \u2018This government does not torture people.\u2019\u201d VIDEO: http://bit.ly/1BybPBQ\n\nTORTURE TAKEAWAYS:\n\n--ANDREW SULLIVAN: \u201cThe great achievement of this report ... is its meticulousness. No one can now claim that these torture sessions gave us anything of any worth, while damning this country for decades to come as the worst human rights abuser in the West.\u201d http://bit.ly/1ukz8av\n\n--JEFFREY GOLDBERG: \u201cThe next time a group of Islamist terrorists succeeds in killing large numbers of Americans\u2014and such an attack should be expected\u2014it is important for those who are in positions of power (very much including the writers and commentators who shape popular thinking) to keep in mind that the goal of the United States is to neutralize the threat, and not to seek retribution for the sake of retribution.\u201d http://theatln.tc/1By74Ix\n\n-- R. Jeffrey Smith ?( @rjsmithcpi): \u201cBush himself expressed discomfort when shown pic of detainee in diaper chained to ceiling & forced to defecate on self, sez Intell Rpt.\u201d\n\n--JOHN McCAIN on the Senate floor: \u201c[T]he American people ... must know when the values that define our nation are intentionally disregarded by our security policies ... They must be able to make informed judgments about whether those policies and the personnel who supported them were justified in compromising our values; whether they served a greater good; or whether, as I believe, they stained our national honor, did much harm and little practical good.\u201d http://1.usa.gov/1z5Bwq3\n\n--DAVID IGNATIUS: \u201cThis is a political document, not a dispassionate history, but that\u2019s part of its value: There simply is no way for a democracy to get past a trauma like the interrogation issue without an honest public accounting. It\u2019s a strange healing process, ripping off the scab, exposing our wounds; perhaps it\u2019s like the self-flagellation of the early saints.\u201d http://wapo.st/1Aep32A\n\nDRILLING DOWN:\n\n--\u201cDoes Torture Work? The C.I.A.\u2019s Claims and What the Committee Found,\u201d by NYT\u2019s Matt Apuzzo, Haeyoun Park and Larry Buchanan: \u201cHere are eight cases cited in the report where the C.I.A. made the case that its tactics thwarted plots and led to the capture of terrorists, and how the committee's report undercut those accounts ... Killing of Osama bin Laden ... Thwarting of Dirty Bomb and Capture of Jos\u00e9 Padilla ... Thwarting of the Karachi Plots ... Thwarting of \u2018Second Wave\u2019 Plot and Discovery of Al Ghurabaa Group ... Identification, Capture and Arrest of Iyman Faris ... Thwarting of the Heathrow Airport and Canary Wharf Plot ...
