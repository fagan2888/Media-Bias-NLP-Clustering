Dr. King's life and his legacy particularly celebrated inclusion and his vision of inclusivity was very broad. My grandfather was an enslaved Cherokee First Nation American and he married an enslaved woman. That is a part of the fabric of my own background,\u201d Overby said.\n\nDuring the event, which was produced and hosted by Overby, Stefan Collins, a student at Madison Area Technical College delivered Dr. King\u2019s \u201cI Have A Dream\u201d speech. Dr. Jack E. Daniels was the keynote speaker and performances were given by Milwaukee's Latino Arts String Orchestra and Singers and Dancers from the Ho-Chunk Nation.\n\n\u201cTo put on an event like this is an opportunity to see not only what Dr. King represented but how he wanted us all to celebrate our differences and the uniqueness of the ancestors of this country. It is a definite way to illuminate as to what makes this country wonderful. It was important to have the Ho-Chunk Nation there,\u201d Overby said.\n\nCollin Price, the Public Relations Officer and enrolled member of the Ho-Chunk Nation spoke well of the event which he saw first-hand.\n\n\u201cIt was great to see. This was the second year we've done this. The organizer, Dr. Overby has been doing this for a number of years. Last year, he called our office and discussed that this should be about the diversity and celebration of Dr. King's legacy,\u201d Price said.\n\n\u201cDr. Overby stated he didn't understand why he didn't think to reach to the Native community In Wisconsin considering there are 11 tribes here. So he said he figured he'd give us a call.\u201d\n\n\u201cLast year and this year, we\u2019ve provided a drum and about 20 dancers to participate at this approximate one hour event at the state capital. The Governor, Chairman John Greendeer and other officials in state government were in attendance. It was pretty cool, all of the dancers felt like rock stars taking pictures with everyone,\u201d Price said.\n\nDr. Overby says celebrating several cultures under one roof was a concept worth remembering.\n\n\u201cThe most talked about aspect of this year's event was the recognition that there was an intentional design to bring these groups and these cultures together. This is the only time of year that this happens at the state capitol \u2013 in which there is a celebration with so many diverse groups, including the audience members, who are sitting next to each other celebrating gospel music, Indian dancing and an orchestra of Latino kids. It was a powerful, powerful experience.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Ho-Chunk Nation participated in a diverse celebration honoring the legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. on Monday.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "kpolisse", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/01/24/ho-chunk-nation-participates-mlk-day-celebration-153223", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/approximately_20_ho-chunk_nation_singers_and_dancers_in_full_regalia_participated_in_mlk_celebration_at_the_wisconsin_capitol_-courtesy_ho-chunk_nation.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "Ho-Chunk Nation Participates in MLK Day Celebration"}, "dcterms.date": "2014-01-24T09:00-05:00", "dc": {"title": "Ho-Chunk Nation Participates in MLK Day Celebration"}, "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/01/24/ho-chunk-nation-participates-mlk-day-celebration-153223", "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Ho-Chunk Nation, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., MLK Day, Wisconsin Public Radio, Dr. Jonathan Overby", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.title": "Ho-Chunk Nation Participates in MLK Day Celebration"}, "article_summary": "Last year, he called our office and discussed that this should be about the diversity and celebration of Dr. King's legacy,\u201d Price said.\nCollin Price, the Public Relations Officer and enrolled member of the Ho-Chunk Nation spoke well of the event which he saw first-hand.\nIt was important to have the Ho-Chunk Nation there,\u201d Overby said.\nDr. Jack E.
