Scottsdale, Ariz. — Watch Troy Tulowitzki on the baseball diamond during the carefree days of spring training and you realize that he’s still a kid at heart.

So it makes sense that Tulo would reach out to ailing kids to lift their spirits and induce some smiles.

Tulo is underwriting an all-expense paid trip to spring training for more than 20 patients from Children’s Hospital Colorado’s Center for Cancer and Blood Disorders. The group will visit spring training from March 6-8, the hospital announced in a press release.

“I have done it for the past couple of years,” Tulowitzki said. “It’s a chance to get them out here for a little mini-vacation. We give them a chance to meet some of the players. It’s a good little getaway.

“They are going through some difficult things and spending a lot of time at the hospital. … I’m looking forward to it.”

For many of the young patients, it will be the first trip away from home without their parents. Doctors and nurses will also be on the trip, but mostly it’s a much-needed getaway and a break from the hospital.

During the regular season, Tulo will see some of the kids at Coors Field.

“Some of them will be at the games and they will say hi and I try to remember their faces,” he said. “I remember them talking about how much fun they had at the hotel and playing at the pool. Like I said, it’s a chance for them to get away.”

Tulowitzki admits he often puts on a serious game face, but he lets his guard down around the kids.

“It’s because I like interacting with kids,” Tulo said. “I think people who know me, know that I can be pretty serious in the clubhouse, but you bring a kid around and I’m probably a different guy. I think I have the patience and I enjoy being around them.”
