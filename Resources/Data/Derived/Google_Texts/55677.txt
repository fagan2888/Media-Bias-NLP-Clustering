In Georgia the state is divided into 16 insurance regions, and the premiums differ quite a bit.

"Atlanta is one of the lower cost regions. In Southwest Georgia, the premiums could be as much as 40 percent higher for the same individual," said Bill Custer, a health insurance expert at Georgia State University.

For example, a person between the ages of 26 and 35 could pay 316 dollars a month in Atlanta. That same person would pay 4 dollars more in Macon, and up to a 150 more in southwestern Mitchell County.

Custer saidthose premiums are before any tax credit is applied. A person with a higher income doesnâ€™t have access to a tax credit. But once a tax credit is applied the rate would get lower.

People in Georgia will buy insurance through the federal exchange because state officials declined to set up their own.

Enrollment starts Oct. 1 and runs through March.
