He rallied behind the scenes with board member Michael Quagliano in a heated proxy battle to wrestle for control of the bankcorp\u2019s board.\n\nTo firm his position, Fenton purchased stock options available to him from prior grants that gave him the second-most shares held by an individual. Several investment groups hold more, according to SEC filings.\n\nThe proxy fight, during which Carmichael openly criticized Quagliano and the other members of his slate, ended last month when the sitting board stepped down, and Quagliano took charge.\n\nCarmichael offered several deals for a compromise solution, each failing.\n\nFenton will be paid $120,000 per year.\n\nQuagliano, Fenton and Carmichael did not immediately respond to efforts to contact them.\n\nDavid Migoya: 303-954-1506, dmigoya@denverpost.com or twitter.com/davidmigoya", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Solera shake-up continues: CEO fired and former CFO gets helm", "title": "Solera shake-up continues: CEO fired and former CFO gets helm", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/07/18/solera-shake-up-continues-ceo-fired-and-former-cfo-gets-helm/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-18T14:29:41+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-18T14:29:41+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd18d0\"", "article_summary": "Senior vice president Andrew Seaton also resigned his post with Solera, the holding company for Solera National Bank in Lakewood.\nFenton had been the bank\u2019s CFO and executive vice president from its inception in September 2007 until he was let go last March.\nQuagliano, Fenton and Carmichael did not immediately respond to efforts to contact them.\nThe management shake-up at Solera National Bancorp continues as John Carmichael was fired as CEO and president, and replaced by the board with former chief financial officer Robert Fenton, according to a regulatory filing Friday.\nThe filing said Carmichael was fired \u201cfor cause\u201d on July 14, and Fenton was named the following day."}
