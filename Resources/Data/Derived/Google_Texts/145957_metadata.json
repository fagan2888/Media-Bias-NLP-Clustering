That market has changed markedly with the federal Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe health law abolished exclusions for pre-existing conditions that health insurers previously used to control costs in the individual market. It also created new online marketplaces like Minnesota's MNsure exchange and extended subsidies to shoppers. Finally, the law called for public notice when health insurers seek rate increases in excess of 10 percent.\n\nIn June, the federal government released proposals for big average jumps in Minnesota not just from Blue Cross but also HealthPartners (23-24 percent), PreferredOne (49 percent) and UCare (12 percent). In July, UCare increased its proposed hike to 27 percent.\n\nMedica changed its request this summer, too, and it is now seeking a 14 percent increase. The insurer's earlier proposal fell short of the threshold for disclosure.\n\n\"As more time goes on, you've got a fuller picture of the risk that you're managing,\" said Dannette Coleman, a senior vice president with the Minnetonka-based insurer.\n\nInsurers say rate increases are needed because of big losses in the individual market. The Minnesota Council of Health Plans tabulated losses in excess of $300 million in 2014, although insurers expect to recover roughly half of that amount through financial safety nets in the health law.\n\nBlue Cross says it lost $135 million in the individual market in 2014. Company spokesman Jim McManus said last week in a statement: \"A larger membership in 2015 is translating into even larger losses.\"\n\nIn the past, proposed rate increases in Minnesota only became public once final rates were approved. With advance notice under the health law, Commerce Department officials this summer invited public comment and received about 50 written responses \u2014 almost all in opposition.\n\nEmployer health plans stable\n\nProposed premium jumps in the individual market contrast with findings from a national report last week that found premiums for people with employer health plans increased just 4 percent this year, continuing a decadelong period of relatively slow growth.\n\nPremiums for employer groups are more stable because the market is much bigger, and it hasn't experienced as much change under the health law, said Jim Schowalter, chief executive at the Minnesota Council of Health Plans, a trade group for insurers. State law prevents insurers from taking money from the group market to subsidize individual health insurance premiums, Schowalter said.\n\nModeling that was completed for the state several years ago forecast that the individual market would grow to include 400,000 to 500,000 people by 2016, Schowalter said. But actual enrollment has fallen short \u2014 about 290,000 people at the end of last year \u2014 perhaps because many found coverage through the state's public health insurance programs.\n\n\"That has a big impact in not diluting the cost and not spreading the cost,\" he said. \"It means higher rates.\" Plus, medical claims have swallowed a much bigger share of premium revenue, he said.\n\nBetween 2010 and 2013, health insurers paid out between 82 cents and 91 cents in medical claims for every dollar of premium revenue in the individual market, according to Commerce Department reports. In 2014, premium revenue in the market grew significantly \u2014 from about $710 million to nearly $1 billion \u2014 but insurers paid out just over $1 in medical claims for every dollar of premium revenue.\n\n\"Health care is more expensive in the individual market than expected,\" Schowalter said.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "News,Minnesota", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Duluth News Tribune", "description": "Thousands of Minnesotans who buy health insurance on their own are bracing for final word on whether their premiums will spike next year.\r\nOn Thursday, the Minnesota Department of Commerce is scheduled to release 2016 rates for shoppers who buy individual policies.\r\nFour insurers that collectively c...", "title": "Health insurance premiums to rise for thousands in Minnesota", "url": "http://www.duluthnewstribune.com/news/3849232-health-insurance-premiums-rise-thousands-minnesota", "image": {"width": 200, "identifier": "http://www.duluthnewstribune.com/sites/all/themes/duluthnewstribune_theme/images/touch-icon.png", "height": 200}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Thousands of Minnesotans who buy health insurance on their own are bracing for final word on whether their premiums will spike next year.\r\nOn Thursday, the Minnesota Department of Commerce is scheduled to release 2016 rates for shoppers who buy individual policies.\r\nFour insurers that collectively c...", "title": "Health insurance premiums to rise for thousands in Minnesota", "url": "http://www.duluthnewstribune.com/news/3849232-health-insurance-premiums-rise-thousands-minnesota", "image": "http://www.duluthnewstribune.com/sites/all/themes/duluthnewstribune_theme/images/touch-icon.png", "site": "duluthnews", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"app_id": 264600393705982}, "keywords": "News,Minnesota", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/duluthnews", "tag": "News,Minnesota", "modified_time": "2015-09-28T20:30:55-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Thousands of Minnesotans who buy health insurance on their own are bracing for final word on whether their premiums will spike next year.\r\nOn Thursday, the..."}, "article_summary": "Health insurance premiums to rise for thousands in MinnesotaThousands of Minnesotans who buy health insurance on their own are bracing for final word on whether their premiums will spike next year.\nThe health law abolished exclusions for pre-existing conditions that health insurers previously used to control costs in the individual market.\nState law prevents insurers from taking money from the group market to subsidize individual health insurance premiums, Schowalter said.\n\"We are dying here under the weight of insurance premiums,\" Kristi Nelson, 53, of Hastings, wrote Commerce Department officials in opposition to a possible rate increase.\nBut actual enrollment has fallen short \u2014 about 290,000 people at the end of last year \u2014 perhaps because many found coverage through the state's public health insurance programs."}
