Pat McCrory as He Guides Coal Ash Response\n\nA new analysis of government records reveals that Duke Energy \u2013 the world\u2019s largest private electric utility \u2013 began writing unusually large checks to the national Republican Governors Association while Gov. Pat McCrory and Republican lawmakers debated how to respond to the company\u2019s giant spill of coal ash sludge into the Dan River.\n\nIn four payments from June to December 2014, Duke sent the Republican Governors Association a total of $3,050,000 \u2013 more than 10 times its previous record donation to the RGA. Duke\u2019s contributions made it the top corporate donor to the RGA in 2014 and the second largest donor, behind the $3.5 million given by billionaire Sheldon Adelson, owner of the Las Vegas Sands.\n\nIn 2012, the RGA spent $5 million to boost the election of Pat McCrory as governor, and it is expected to be a major financial backer of his 2016 bid for reelection. Records show McCrory has attended numerous RGA events and helped the association raise funds.\n\n\u201cDuke Energy\u2019s large donations raise questions about the governor\u2019s ability to serve the public interest more than his own political interest,\u201d said Bob Hall, executive director of the nonpartisan watchdog group Democracy North Carolina. \u201cCritics say the coal ash regulation law passed in 2014 was too soft on Duke. Is this money the reason why?\u201d\n\nRGA\u2019s website says its \u201cprimary mission is to help elect Republican governorships throughout the nation.\u201d As a \u201c527 political organization,\u201d it can receive and spend unlimited donations from corporate and other donors to elect candidates, without directly coordinating with the candidate.\n\nThe organization files relatively obscure reports with the Internal Revenue Service. Democracy North Carolina\u2019s analysis shows that Duke Energy and Progress Energy gave RGA a total of only $40,000 in the five years from Jan. 1, 2003 to Dec. 31, 2007, an average of $8,000 a year.\n\nIn January 2008, Pat McCrory, a long-time Duke Energy executive and former Charlotte mayor, announced his campaign for governor. Within weeks, Duke and Progress Energy began sending checks of $10,000 or more to the RGA, according to the IRS disclosure reports.\n\nIn October 2008, candidate McCrory hosted a fundraiser for the RGA in Charlotte. As the invites circulated, Duke Energy stepped up with a gift of $100,000 \u2013 its first six-figure RGA donation. (See the event invitation at: http://www.scribd.com/doc/240852146/101308-Event-Invite).\n\nDuke and Progress Energy gave a total of $155,000 during 2008 \u2013 or 10 times their previous record of $15,000 in 2007. The two companies, now merged, increased their giving after 2008, reaching a high of $275,000 in 2013 before the new high of $3,050,000 in 2014.\n\nThe companies also increased their donations to other 527 partisan committees. Duke Energy gave $200,000 to the Democratic Governors Association in 2012 and another $200,000 in 2014. Progress Energy donated $200,000 to the DGA in 2013.\n\nDuke also donated a total of $235,000 during 2012-2014 to the Republican State Leadership Committee, which its website says promotes \u201cthe election of state Republican candidates.\u201d\n\nHall pointed out that Duke may be donating significant amounts of money to other electioneering committees that do not file disclosure reports \u2013 including Renew North Carolina, a nonprofit set up by Pat McCrory\u2019s supporters to help his political career, and NC House Legislative Partners, which supports Republican General Assembly candidates.\n\n\u201cThe public has a right to know who is donating to our lawmakers and their reelection efforts, directly and through shadow committees,\u201d Hall said. \u201cDuke Energy should lead the way by voluntarily disclosing its contributions to these committees.\u201d\n\n* * * * *\n\nHere are the donations from Duke and Progress Energy and to the Republican Governors Association disclosed (form 8872) at: http://forms.irs.gov/app/pod/basicSearch/search?execution=e1s2\n\nDONATIONS TO REPUBLICAN GOVERNORS ASSOCIATION\n\nDuke Energy 12/12/2014 $ 275,000\n\nDuke Energy 10/21/2014 $ 2,000,000\n\nDuke Energy 09/30/2014 $ 500,000\n\nDuke Energy 06/17/2014 $ 275,000 2014 Total $3,050,000\n\nProgress Energy 09/17/2013 $ 175,000\n\nProgress Energy 04/24/2013 $ 100,000 2013 Total $ 275,000\n\nDuke Energy 11/09/2012 $ 900\n\nDuke Energy 11/02/2012 $ 450\n\nDuke Energy 06/22/2012 $ 175,000\n\nProgress Energy 05/22/2012 $ 25,000 2012 Total $ 201,350\n\nDuke Energy 12/28/2011 $ 25,000\n\nDuke Energy 11/16/2011 $ 450\n\nProgress Energy 11/16/2011 $ 25,000\n\nProgress Energy 10/25/2011 ($ 15,000)\n\nProgress Energy 09/26/2011 $ 15,000\n\nProgress Energy 09/08/2011 $ 15,000\n\nDuke Energy 06/13/2011 $ 75,000\n\nDuke Energy 06/13/2011 $ 25,000\n\nProgress Energy 02/15/2011 $ 10,000 2011 Total $ 175,450\n\nDuke Energy 09/29/2010 $ 50,000\n\nDuke Energy 09/16/2010 $ 50,000\n\nDuke Energy 04/12/2010 $ 25,000\n\nDuke Energy 02/25/2010 $ 25,000 2010 Total $ 150,000\n\nDuke Energy 12/14/2009 $ 25,000\n\nDuke Energy 05/05/2009 $ 15,000\n\nDuke Energy 03/16/2009 $ 50,000\n\nProgress Energy 01/27/2009 $ 10,000 2009 Total $ 100,000\n\nDuke Energy 09/09/2008 $ 100,000\n\nProgress Energy 08/27/2008 $ 20,000\n\nDuke Energy 03/06/2008 $ 25,000\n\nProgress Energy 01/29/2008 $ 10,000 2008 Total $ 155,000\n\nDuke Energy 06/19/2007 $ 5,000\n\nProgress Energy 01/30/2007 $ 10,000 2007 Total $ 15,000\n\nProgress Energy 03/16/2006 $ 10,000 2006 Total $ 10,000", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 71966175060}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://pulse.ncpolicywatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/cropped-logo_shadow-square-270x270.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1e57\"", "article_summary": "In January 2008, Pat McCrory, a long-time Duke Energy executive and former Charlotte mayor, announced his campaign for governor.\nAs the invites circulated, Duke Energy stepped up with a gift of $100,000 \u2013 its first six-figure RGA donation.\nDuke and Progress Energy gave a total of $155,000 during 2008 \u2013 or 10 times their previous record of $15,000 in 2007.\nPat McCrory and Republican lawmakers debated how to respond to the company\u2019s giant spill of coal ash sludge into the Dan River.\nDuke Energy gave $200,000 to the Democratic Governors Association in 2012 and another $200,000 in 2014."}
