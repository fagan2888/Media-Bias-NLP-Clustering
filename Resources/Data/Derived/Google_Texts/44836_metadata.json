The Huskies fell 62-57 at home to Stony Brook.\n\n\u201cThis (loss) came as a total surprise to me,\u201d said veteran Washington coach Lorenzo Romar.\n\nThose Sunday shockers became emblematic of a conferencewide malaise. Other than eighth-ranked Arizona and No. 10 Utah flexing their talent, Pac-12 teams in general have sputtered toward Friday\u2019s opening of league play.\n\nPac-12 teams won just six of 17 games against ranked nonconference opponents. In conference RPI, the Pac-12 is sixth, trailing the four other \u201cpower conferences\u201d and also the new-look Big East. For team RPI, only two Pac-12 teams \u2014 Arizona (11) and Utah (12) \u2014 are among the nation\u2019s top 30. And just two others \u2014 Washington (37) and Stanford (42) \u2014 are in the top 90.\n\nTwo of the Pac-12\u2019s biggest disappointments meet Friday night in Boulder when Colorado (7-5) hosts UCLA (8-5) at 8 p.m. at the Coors Events Center.\n\nColorado, 23-12 last season, was picked in the Pac-12\u2019s preseason media poll to finish third, behind Arizona and Utah. But the Buffaloes have not defeated a team likely to play in the NCAA Tournament this year.\n\nUCLA was picked in the Pac-12 preseason poll to finish fourth. To their credit, the Bruins played Oklahoma, North Carolina, Gonzaga, Kentucky and Alabama in nonconference games but lost all of them.\n\nColorado is hoping to extend its string of three consecutive trips to the NCAA Tournament. But after losing five times in nonconference games, the Buffs are left with a small margin for error. Even going 12-6 in the Pac-12 regular season \u2014 which wouldn\u2019t be easy \u2014 would leave CU a game shy of 20 victories.\n\nMeaning no disrespect to other Pac-12 teams, Colorado coach Tad Boyle likes to say that turning things around \u201cis about us\u201d and not about who is next on the Buffs\u2019 schedule.\n\n\u201cThe way the basketball season plays out,\u201d Boyle said, \u201cis you\u2019ve got your preseason (nonconference) schedule, your conference schedule and you\u2019re guaranteed one game in the conference tournament. Other than that, nothing is guaranteed.\n\n\u201cThe preseason is over and done with. It\u2019s water under the bridge. We have to learn from it.\u201d\n\nHere is a brief look at Pac-12 teams that could make some noise as conference play gets ready to tip off:\n\nArizona (12-1): The Wildcats have impact players everywhere on the court, including the league\u2019s top freshman in 6-6 forward Stanley Johnson. A loss at UNLV shows they can be beaten.\n\nUtah (10-2): The Utes showed they\u2019re for real with a win over Wichita State. Delon Wright is the Pac-12\u2019s best point guard, and 7-foot freshman Jakob Poeltl provides an inside presence that had been missing.\n\nWashington (11-1): Point guard Nigel Williams-Goss and 7-footer Robert Upshaw give the Huskies an outside-inside duo. Upshaw has blocked 55 shots.\n\nStanford (8-3): The Cardinal notched the Pac-12\u2019s most impressive nonconference win at then-No. 9 Texas on Dec. 23. Key components are back from last year\u2019s Sweet 16 run, and frosh Reid Travis hits the boards hard.\n\nColorado (7-5): Despite their disappointing record, the Buffs have one of the league\u2019s top trios with center Josh Scott, forward Xavier Johnson and guard Askia Booker. If those three can get some help, the Buffs could make a run.\n\nUCLA (8-5): The Bruins are in a process of a makeover after losing three players to the first round of the 2014 NBA draft. But a backcourt of Bryce Alford and Norman Powell (only returning starter) is a good start.\n\nOregon (10-3): The Ducks appeared dead in the water with offseason dismissals of key players. But the Pac-12\u2019s top scorer, 6-2 James Young (20.3), returned. Newcomers Dwayne Benjamin and Jordan Bell work hard inside.\n\nCalifornia (10-3): Junior swingman Tyrone Wallace is having a big year, but the loss to Cal State Bakersfield shows the points-starved Bears need injured Jabari Bird (ankle) back soon.\n\nTom Kensler: tkensler@denverpost.com or twitter.com/tomkensler", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Pac-12 basketball aims to rebound from rough nonconference", "title": "Pac-12 basketball aims to rebound from rough nonconference", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/01/01/pac-12-basketball-aims-to-rebound-from-rough-nonconference/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150101__20150102_B10_SP02BKCPAC12p1.jpg", "height": 441}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150101__20150102_B10_SP02BKCPAC12p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-01-01T18:24:23+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T07:27:28+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "University of Colorado"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccdd3\"", "article_summary": "Answer: Each defeated a Pac-12 Conference men\u2019s basketball team this season.\n10 Utah flexing their talent, Pac-12 teams in general have sputtered toward Friday\u2019s opening of league play.\nPac-12 teams won just six of 17 games against ranked nonconference opponents.\nFor team RPI, only two Pac-12 teams \u2014 Arizona (11) and Utah (12) \u2014 are among the nation\u2019s top 30.\nUCLA was picked in the Pac-12 preseason poll to finish fourth."}
