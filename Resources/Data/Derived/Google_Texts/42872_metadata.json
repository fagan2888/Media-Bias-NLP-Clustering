The federal government covers most of the costs of the expansion.\n\nYet in many states Republicans say their Medicaid programs are already bloated, and that piling on new enrollees will bust their budgets down the road. They also don\u2019t trust Washington to hold up its end of the funding.\n\nOn Capitol Hill GOP leaders want to scrap Obamacare, period, and start over with \u201cmarket-oriented\u201d reforms, rendering the expansion debate moot.\n\nCountering those arguments, HHS highlighted Republican-led states they said could benefit from expansion.\n\nFor instance, nearly a quarter of Texans whose incomes would qualify them for Medicaid post-expansion suffer from mental illness or a substance abuse disorder, according to the study. The proportion is even higher in Florida, at 27.7 percent, HHS said.\n\nThe study said 16.4 percent of insured people with substance abuse or behavioral problems sought treatment during 2010-2014 in states that haven\u2019t expanded Medicaid, compared to 11.5 percent of similarly situated, yet uninsured, persons in those states.\n\nThe timing of the report coincides with efforts on Capitol Hill to address the opioid and heroin epidemic that is ravaging the country and forge bipartisan mental health reforms despite election-year politics that are otherwise splintering Congress.\n\n\u201cAs we talk to states, both on the Republican side and Democratic side, behavioral health inevitably comes up as a topic of discussion,\u201d said Mr. Frank, adding the talks are fueled in part by the opioid crisis.\n\n\u201cWe thought it was a good time to inject some new facts into that discussion,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Nearly 2 million uninsured people with a mental illness or substance-abuse problem live in states that haven't expanded Medicaid, the administration said Monday in a report that urges state Republicans to embrace Obamacare as a pathway to recovery and economic growth.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Nearly 2 million uninsured people with a mental illness or substance-abuse problem live in states that haven\u2019t expanded Medicaid, the administration said Monday in a report that urges state Republicans to embrace Obamacare as a pathway to recovery and economic growth.", "title": "HHS says Medicaid expansion will combat opioid crisis, mental illness", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/28/hhs-medicaid-expansion-will-combat-opioid-crisis/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/09/15/634cf8175587bc245f0f6a7067008eed.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/09/15/634cf8175587bc245f0f6a7067008eed.jpg", "description": "Nearly 2 million uninsured people with a mental illness or substance-abuse problem live in states that haven't expanded Medicaid, the administration said Monday in a report that urges state Republican", "card": "summary", "title": "HHS says Medicaid expansion will combat opioid crisis, mental illness"}, "Author": "Tom Howell Jr.", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Health Medical Pharma, Social Issues, Richard Frank"}, "article_summary": "For instance, nearly a quarter of Texans whose incomes would qualify them for Medicaid post-expansion suffer from mental illness or a substance abuse disorder, according to the study.\nIt would also help 371,000 people overcome depression, since nearly a third of those with serious mental illnesses are expected to seek treatment if they have Medicaid coverage.\nThe administration pleaded with reluctant states to expand Medicaid under Obamacare, insisting Monday that nearly 2 million people with mental illnesses or drug problems could get insurance help.\nCountering those arguments, HHS highlighted Republican-led states they said could benefit from expansion.\nOn Capitol Hill GOP leaders want to scrap Obamacare, period, and start over with \u201cmarket-oriented\u201d reforms, rendering the expansion debate moot."}
