I had to actually pull out a pencil and piece of paper and write down potential solutions.\n\nIt actually gets worse later on with a puzzle tied to figuring out how to illuminate a series of spokes that is part of a massive vault door. Solving the sequence requires either a conference with a group of number theorists or blind luck. I chose blind luck after about 20 minutes of wheel twisting and button pushing.\n\nThe participant\u2019s only power besides deduction is called retrospective. This sort of memory or clue-inducer gets enacted when two fingers pinch away on the screen. A haze covers the location and highlights lit areas that might lead to listening to a cassette recording or honing in on an objective.\n\nAdding to help solve the mystery and puzzles, our patient, or experiment, gets easy to access journey housing everything he has found. All objects such a key for a door, an old photograph, a hastily written note, a flask with purple liquid, to name a few, can be carefully examined or read through a 360-degree perspective and simple text display for documents.\n\nDespite the game\u2019s difficulty, figure at least a few hours of explorative action, developers do a great job using the touch-screen functionality of Apple\u2019s magical tablet.\n\nUse a pair of virtual analog sticks on the iPad screen to slowly move about, or tap an area and walk there immediately. All of the puzzles require on-screen tactile responses such as using fingers to roll tumblers, turn door keys, twisting valves, pressing buttons, rotating hoses and tapping on piano keys, for example.\n\nAdditionally, lovers of an aural fright are in for treat. Pop in the ear buds and listen closely as Black Wing Foundation throws in near every combination of sound effects to set a claustrophobic mood and a few hair-raising surprises.\n\nNearly every sound tries to elicit a shiver \u2014 be it a door creaking, water dripping, an ominous musical chord, moaning, heavy breathing, weeping, a choir emoting (plucked from \u201cThe Omen\u201d), church bells ringing loud enough to shake the screen, wind blowing and a crow cawing.\n\nAlthough the action In Fear I Trust will keep the puzzle fan on the edge of his seat, it never attains the genuine horrors seen in comparable titles (reference The Walking Dead from Telltale Games) and will not entice seasoned gamers looking for a mobile fright.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Mobile players solve puzzles and the mystery of test subject 17\u2019s incarceration in a new mobile game for iOS devices.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Mobile players solve puzzles and the mystery of test subject 17\u2019s incarceration in a new mobile game for iOS devices.", "title": "Zadzooks: In Fear I Trust review (iPad)", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/feb/3/zadzooks-fear-i-trust-review-ipad/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/02/03/ipad-photo-fear.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/02/03/ipad-photo-fear.jpg", "description": "Mobile players solve puzzles and the mystery of test subject 17\u2019s incarceration in a new mobile game for iOS devices.", "card": "summary", "title": "Zadzooks: In Fear I Trust review (iPad)"}, "Author": "Joseph Szadkowski", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9655\"", "article_summary": "Trapped in his iPad, a gamer attempts to solve the puzzling psychological horrors of the unknown in the mobile mystery In Fear I Trust (Chillingo and Black Wing Foundation, rated 17+, $2.99).\nInstead, what players get is the horror of having to solve multiple puzzles that would make mathematical- and logic-challenged individual\u2019s weep.\nUse a pair of virtual analog sticks on the iPad screen to slowly move about, or tap an area and walk there immediately.\nAdding to help solve the mystery and puzzles, our patient, or experiment, gets easy to access journey housing everything he has found.\nThis sort of memory or clue-inducer gets enacted when two fingers pinch away on the screen."}
