About 400,000 Virginians still don't have health care coverage, six years after the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act was signed into law.

U.S. Rep. Robert C. "Bobby" Scott, D-Newport News, held a press conference in the Southeast Community Thursday to note the anniversary and push for Medicaid expansion.

Many of the uninsured have incomes that are too high to qualify for Medicaid, but they don't make enough to purchase coverage. Those people drive up health care costs for everyone through the use of emergency services that often go uncompensated, Scott said.

"The only glitch in the (ACA) is that some states, unfortunately like Virginia, have not expanded Medicaid," Scott said. "Everybody in Virginia is suffering as a result of the failure to expand Medicaid."

The conference was held at the Newport News Community Free Clinic, and owner Golden Bethune-Hill shared stories about people who came through her doors too late. One woman, diagnosed with stage 4 uterine cancer, could not be saved.

"Because she was so far advanced, there was little we (could) do," she said.

While Bethune-Hill also has many stories of people they've been able to help, the clinic doesn't have enough resources to reach everyone in the community without insurance. It's run mostly by volunteers and funded with donations, she said.

"The free clinic can only take so many people," Bethune-Hill said.

Expanding Medicaid would give the uninsured access to preventive care and early screening through a primary care physician, she said.

"Hopefully we can get beyond the politics," she said. "We have a lot of work to do."
