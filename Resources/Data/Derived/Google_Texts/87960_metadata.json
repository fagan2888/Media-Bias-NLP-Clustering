No one will mistake him for a political outside, but that doesn't mean that in the past, he's stood for business as usual.\n\n\n\nIn a race of headline grabbing bravado, a John Kasich Town Hall sounds like a walk down memory lane where he highlights accomplishments from years ago in Congress.\n\n\n\nBut where others talk about what they might do, Kasich simply reads from his own resume.\n\n\n\n\"I was one of the architects of balancing the federal budget,\" said Kasich. \"We've taken Ohio from big deficits to surpluses and growth of 347,000 jobs. It's not just being for reform, it's knowing how to get it done and that's what I've done all my career.\"\n\n\n\nThat included when he embraced the expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\n\n\"What we've done is we're treating the mentally ill and trying to get them from going to prison where they cost a lot more money each year,\" said Kasich. \"Helping the drug-addicted to get on their feet and be productive citizens. Helping the working poor to get comprehensive healthcare so they're not ringing up all of our bills in the Emergency Room.\"\n\n\n\nFor that, he took heat from Republicans. The catch is, it doesn't bother him.\n\n\n\n\"People may not want to do it the way I did it but they need to tell you how they'd do it because it's not right to leave those people in the shadows,\" said Kasich.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The earliest part of the 2016 race for the White House has been defined by the rise of the outsider candidates, who proudly push their lack of experience in elected office.", "title": "Kasich: A Different Voice in 2016", "og": {"site_name": "KGAN", "description": "The earliest part of the 2016 race for the White House has been defined by the rise of the outsider candidates, who proudly push their lack of experience in elected office.", "title": "Kasich: A Different Voice in 2016", "url": "http://cbs2iowa.com/news/local/kasich-a-different-voice-in-2016", "image": "http://static-12.sinclairstoryline.com/resources/media/3163a0f7-00e0-42d3-980f-96cec26c3c0f-xhk0a0oM.JPG?1451919854796", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@cbs2iowa", "image": "http://static-11.sinclairstoryline.com/resources/media/3163a0f7-00e0-42d3-980f-96cec26c3c0f-xhk0a0oM.JPG?1451919854796", "description": "The earliest part of the 2016 race for the White House has been defined by the rise of the outsider candidates, who proudly push their lack of experience in elected office.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Kasich: A Different Voice in 2016"}, "author": "Sinclair Broadcast Group", "blitz": "mu-cc36119f-f4dca522-3261b206-4b3bbd3f", "robots": "index, follow", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "keywords": "news,iowa in focus,local,IA", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/kgancbs2", "published_time": "2015-10-01T21:14:24+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=0.5"}, "article_summary": "Ohio Governor John Kasich represented Ohio in the House of Representatives for almost 20 years.\nIn a race of headline grabbing bravado, a John Kasich Town Hall sounds like a walk down memory lane where he highlights accomplishments from years ago in Congress.\nCEDAR RAPIDS, IA (CBS2/FOX28) - The earliest part of the 2016 race for the White House has been defined by the rise of the outsider candidates, who proudly push their lack of experience in elected office.\nBut where others talk about what they might do, Kasich simply reads from his own resume.\nHelping the working poor to get comprehensive healthcare so they're not ringing up all of our bills in the Emergency Room.\""}
