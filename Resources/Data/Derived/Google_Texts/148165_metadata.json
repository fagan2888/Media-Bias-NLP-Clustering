We live in a republic, I understand that, but everyone has to live together.\u201d\n\nHoke said the state constitution and the rule of law would dictate how any potential law would be applied.\n\nThe resolution would only encourage state lawmakers to not accept federal actions and not force them to do anything.\n\n\u201cThe people have got to understand and begin to see if we don\u2019t do something, we can\u2019t defend ourselves at the state border,\u201d Hoke said.\n\nThe resolution would also send members of the Tennessee General Assembly the message that their actions need to back up their anti-federal government rhetoric, said Commissioner Brad Turner, the steering committee\u2019s vice chair.\n\n\u201cIf your actions don\u2019t back that and you don\u2019t stick up for us, that does us no good,\u201d Turner said.\n\nReach Brian Wilson at 615-278-5165.
