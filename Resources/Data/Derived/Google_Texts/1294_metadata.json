Open enrollment for 2015 plans started Saturday and runs through mid-February.\n\n\n\nThe costs don't include subsidies. Individuals making less than roughly $46,000 a year and a four-person family with an income of less than $94,000 a year will qualify for subsidies to offset costs.\n\n\n\nMonroe County, home to the Florida Keys, had the highest average premiums for \"silver plans\" for all three groups of policyholders, as it did last year. In 2015, a 27-year-old individual in Monroe County will pay almost $370 a month for coverage in the \"silver\" plan without subsidies, while a 40-year-old couple with two children will pay almost $1,350 a month.\n\n\n\nGulf County in the Panhandle had the lowest average premiums for all three groups of policy holders.\n\n\n\nNearly 1 million Floridians signed up for health plans in the inaugural year of the law and 91 percent received a subsidy to help pay their monthly premiums.\n\n\n\nWhen looking at year-to-year premium prices for the \"benchmark\" plans in each county, there was wider variation in the premium changes. The \"benchmark\" plans are the second-lowest cost \"silver\" plans in a county. Consumers get a tax credit for health insurance based on income and on the premium for the \"benchmark\" plan in their area.\n\n\n\nRoughly 1 out of 5 Florida counties had drops ranging from 1 to 21 percent in their benchmark premiums for a 27-year-old individual. Four-fifths of Florida's counties saw increases in the premiums of the benchmark plans for a 27-year-old individual. Half of Florida's counties had increases of more than 10 percent.\n\nCopyright 2014 by The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
