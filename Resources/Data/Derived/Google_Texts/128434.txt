Itâs a situation that pits the educator in him against the administrator heâs charged with being.

Every day is a challenge in April Renzetti’s classroom. As a special education teacher at Washington Township High School, she works with students with needs so severe that verbal communication is often difficult, and frustrations can lead to self-injury.

Now, as the Affordable Care Act has pushed the school district to change the way it approaches some of its staffing procedures, she said her job is only going to get harder.

Consistency is key for special needs students, said Renzetti, who spoke on the issue at the board of education’s work session Tuesday night. One student in particular, who is nonverbal and prone to self injury, was making significant strides through daily, one-on-one work with her full-time aide, she said.

Only the aide wasn’t technically a full-time employee of the district. In the morning, she worked part-time as a district employee, and in the afternoon as an employee of Source4Teachers, the company the district uses to outsource its substitute services.

Under Affordable Care Act provisions — which include hefty fines for employers who don’t offer health care to employees working beyond a set amount of hours a week — the technical separation of her employers didn’t matter. According to Board of Education Solicitor Joseph Betley, the Affordable Care Act goes by the “joint employer” legal theory and would view the one-on-one aide as a full-time employee of the district. In order to prevent serious financial risks, the district administration made the call that all part-time employees who fall in that category — originally thought to be 16, but Superintendent Robert Goldschmidt said it could be more — can no longer sub in the district as well.

Renzetti’s student’s aide, unable to work just half-a-day in the schools, left to find full-time work.

“This student is going to get a new person every day to walk the hallways, to take her to lunch. She’s not going to be responsive because she doesn’t know this person,” said Renzetti. She told the board her student’s progress will likely go back to square one.

“I guarantee she’s going to have setback after setback,” she said.

Goldschmidt said it’s a situation that pits the educator in him against the administrator he’s charged with being. He sees the difficulties it’s posing in the classroom, but he also has to pull back and look at the overall impact ACA fines will have on the district’s mission.

“This is an extremely complicated issue that pits the economic well-being of the district against some educational issues in ways that are hard to resolve,” said Goldschmidt. “If we have to pay stiff fines down the line, because we didn’t comply appropriately with the Affordable Care Act, that’s money that won’t go into the classroom ... when we protect the district’s financial interest, we protect programs we provide for kids. People lose sight of that.”

Kevin Bush, president and chief operating officer at Source4Teachers, said Washington Township is the only district he’s seen run into the joint-employer issue.

The Cherry Hill-based company had no role in the district’s decision, but took action to notify the affected employees about the issue as part of its partnership with the district. If the move pushes the employees to seek full-time work, Bush said the company will work to find them daily assignments.

“It’s really not an issue for us, we’re just trying to be a good partner through the district and help them however we can,” said Bush.

The most obvious solution — make all of the one-on-one aides full-time — isn’t as simple as it seems, said Goldschmidt.

“One of the ways we and many other districts have tried to save money in recent years is, where it’s appropriate, to make the aides part-time,” said Goldschmidt, adding the estimated $1 million in savings from the staffing switch has been significant, especially in recent years that have seen state aid cut by the millions and the bills to implement state mandates pile up quickly.

“That doesn’t mean we care more about $1 million than our kids, it’s about finding that balance,” said Goldschmidt. “That’s the fight. That’s the challenge.”

The district has made exceptions from their decision for its job coaches, a highly-specialized position that works with special education students who need job skill training in the field. They develop relationships with the students, as well as local businesses who employ the students, and spend most days outside of the school.

He said they’re looking at every specific situation in the district this impacts to see if they can make exceptions there as well.

“We’re going to have to do this one case at a time to avoid trying to make any blanket exceptions,” said Goldschmidt.

Renzetti is hopeful she’ll soon see her neediest students with one, consistent aide as the district works to resolve the situation, but she’s going to have some difficult days in her classroom in the meantime.

“Until that happens, we’ll have any Joe Schmo who takes the job for the day,” she said.
