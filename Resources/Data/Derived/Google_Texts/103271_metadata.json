He\u2019s counting on me 100 percent,\u2019 \u201d said the filmmaking paddler.\n\nWeihenmayer heard the radio in his ear go silent. He was accustomed to Taney following him, giving instructions through his earpiece. The river roared. Weihenmayer\u2019s kayak pitched violently.\n\nWeihenmayer, who is blind, leaned into his strokes but the kayak tipped. He swam from the boat. Taney, who somehow rolled with half a paddle, arrived seconds later to rescue him.\n\nThere was another hundred miles of kayaking ahead in the expedition and Weihenmayer was rattled. But his relentless drive \u2014 the same inspirational pursuit of sightless adventure that has pushed him to the top of Mount Everest and the tallest peaks on each continent \u2014 led him to walking back up to the top of Lava Falls the next morning in order to kayak it cleanly.\n\n\u201cI had to do it again,\u201d said the 46-year-old Weihenmayer, soon after spending three weeks last month kayaking 277 miles of the Colorado River through the Grand Canyon, one of the most stout stretches of remote whitewater in the country.\n\nBlind since he was 13, Weihenmayer wasn\u2019t aiming for glory. He wasn\u2019t driven by machismo or by competition. He wanted to cleanly paddle the Class V rapid for those whose lives are void of light.\n\n\u201cPeople can get shoved into dark places and they get lost and they can\u2019t climb out. They feel like they have zero impact in the world and they have no purpose,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to reach them and teach them; bring them through my journeys. Show them there\u2019s a process and there\u2019s a tool kit that they can build to live a no-barriers life.\u201d\n\nWeihenmayer, of Golden, is no stranger to adventure. He is an accomplished climber and mountaineer whose r\u00e9sum\u00e9 includes being the only blind person to climb the world\u2019s tallest mountain, in 2001. He skydives and paraglides. He skis the backcountry and climbs frozen waterfalls. He has raced across the Moroccan Desert on foot.\n\nWATCH: No Barriers\u2019 Grand Canyon celebration and reflection\n\nWATCH: No Barriers\u2019 Grand Canyon expedition recap\n\nAs the force behind his No Barriers USA foundation, which aims to change lives through trans- formative outdoor experiences, Weihenmayer\u2019s adversity-dashing feats have prodded more than 500 people to take the \u201cno barriers pledge.\u201d Following his lead, they are volunteering, losing weight, kicking cigarettes, mentoring kids and starting nonprofits.\n\n\u201cWhatever their stretch is,\u201d he said. \u201cWhatever they want to do with their lives, pushing their boundaries.\u201d\n\nKayaking definitely pushed Weihenmayer beyond his already broad limits. Methodical, calculated ascents \u2014 even of the world\u2019s most daunting peaks \u2014 didn\u2019t prepare him for the dynamic, reactionary nature of white- water kayaking. He had to accept that things would go wrong. His boat would be knocked off line. He was going to flip. He was going to have to roll up and fight.\n\n\u201cThe water is moving underneath you in a crazy, chaotic way and everything is hitting you from different directions, and you are trying to understand those forces by what you are hearing and what you are feeling and what your guide is telling you,\u201d Weihen- mayer said. \u201cIt\u2019s such a challenge and it\u2019s relentless, but it\u2019s also very rewarding.\u201d\n\nBlind kayaking is not an individual sport. It takes a floating village. A fleet of guides chased Weihenmayer down the river.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lot like playing two video games at the same time. You have to paddle on your own, plus you are responsible for another person,\u201d said Boulder climber-paddler-musician-troubadour Timmy O\u2019Neill, who has kayaked alongside Weihenmayer for years as they aimed for the ultimate trip down the Grand.\n\nJason Blevins: 303-954-1374, jblevins@denverpost.com or twitter.com/jasonblevins\n\nRead Erik Weihenmayer\u2019s trip reports and see videos from the Grand Canyon at his blog http://www.touchthetop.com/blog/", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Erik Weihenmayer shows once again that barriers can be broken with ambition", "title": "Erik Weihenmayer shows once again that barriers can be broken with ambition", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/10/18/erik-weihenmayer-shows-once-again-that-barriers-can-be-broken-with-ambition/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141018__20141019_CC12_SP19OUTKAYAK1p1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141018__20141019_CC12_SP19OUTKAYAK1p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-10-18T19:44:20+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T23:35:00+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Fishing, hunting"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe062e\"", "article_summary": "Jason Blevins: 303-954-1374, jblevins@denverpost.com or twitter.com/jasonblevinsRead Erik Weihenmayer\u2019s trip reports and see videos from the Grand Canyon at his blog http://www.touchthetop.com/blog/\nMethodical, calculated ascents \u2014 even of the world\u2019s most daunting peaks \u2014 didn\u2019t prepare him for the dynamic, reactionary nature of white- water kayaking.\nHarlan Taney\u2019s kayak paddle snapped in half last month at the bottom of Lava Falls, the Colorado River\u2019s burliest rapid in the Grand Canyon.\nWeihenmayer\u2019s kayak pitched violently.\nUnder water, one-bladed and struggling to right his kayak in the roiling rapid, the veteran river guide had only one thought: His pal, Erik Weihenmayer, could be in trouble."}
