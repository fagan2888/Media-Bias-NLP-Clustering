Under the new law, the federal government imposes a tax on the workers\u2019 \u201cCadillac\u201d health care plan.\n\n\u201cPresident Obama ran on a platform that he would not tax medical plans and at the 2009 AFL-CIO Convention, you stated that labor would not stand for a tax on our benefits.\" Following that promise, however, Obama pushed labor groups for exactly that tax, with the AFL-CIO acceding to the political pressure, according to McEllrath. \"We feel the Federation has done a great disservice to the labor movement and all working people by going along to get along,\" McEllrath said.\n\nLeal Sundet, a \u201ccommitteeman\u201d with the longshoremen\u2019s union, went even further in criticizing the AFL-CIO, saying the group was marching \u201cin lockstep\u201d with Obama on the labor union health care tax. He and McEllrath also expressed stronger support for immigration policy reform than ideas floated by the White House and democratic members of Congress. Sundet said the President\u2019s immigration plan would give only highly paid workers a \u201creal path to citizenship,\u201d while ignoring the working class.\n\nAlthough the labor unions still exercise tremendous political power in American politics, membership has fallen in recent decades. Whereas once a third of the U.S. labor force belonged to unions, today only 11.3 percent of the workforce is comprised of union workers.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "afl-cio, longshoremen's union, afl-cio, longshoremen oppose obamacare, single-payer health care", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "The 40,000-member longshoremen's union has parted ways with the AFL-CIO, citing health care taxes and support for a national single-payer system.", "title": "Longshoremen Part Ways With Major Labor Union In Support Of Single-Payer Health Care", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/longshoremen-part-ways-major-labor-union-support-single-payer-health-care-255288", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/02/longshoremen-leave-afl-cio-partnership-over-obamacare.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The 40,000-member longshoremen's union has parted ways with the AFL-CIO, citing health care taxes and support for a national single-payer system.", "title": "Longshoremen Part Ways With Major Labor Union In Support Of Single-Payer Health Care", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/longshoremen-part-ways-major-labor-union-support-single-payer-health-care-255288", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/02/longshoremen-leave-afl-cio-partnership-over-obamacare.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/02/longshoremen-leave-afl-cio-partnership-over-obamacare.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2013-09-02T13:30:17-04:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-02T13:30:17-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "The 40,000-member longshoremen's union has parted ways with the AFL-CIO, citing health care taxes and support for a national single-payer system."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0ddc\"", "article_summary": "McEllrath said the longshoremen oppose the federal health care law known as Obamacare in favor of a single-payer, nationalized health care policy.\nLeal Sundet, a \u201ccommitteeman\u201d with the longshoremen\u2019s union, went even further in criticizing the AFL-CIO, saying the group was marching \u201cin lockstep\u201d with Obama on the labor union health care tax.\nAlthough the labor unions still exercise tremendous political power in American politics, membership has fallen in recent decades.\nUnder the new law, the federal government imposes a tax on the workers\u2019 \u201cCadillac\u201d health care plan.\nWhereas once a third of the U.S. labor force belonged to unions, today only 11.3 percent of the workforce is comprised of union workers."}
