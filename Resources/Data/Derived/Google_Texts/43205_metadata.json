They found that Pioneer ACOs reduced low-value service volume 1.9 percent in the program's first year, leading to a 4.5 percent drop in spending on such services. The reduction was more pronounced among ACOs that already provided an above-average amount of low-value services.\n\nThe biggest reductions were among the most frequently delivered services, such as cancer screening, according to the study. \"These results are consistent with the hypothesis that alternative payment models with global budgets can discourage overuse even while preserving broad provider discretion in determining which services are of low value,\" Schwartz and his team wrote.\n\nThe research, Schwartz and his team noted, is limited by the fact that many organizations that volunteered for the Pioneer program were likely ahead of the curve on targeting and cutting wasteful practices. Despite these limitations, they said, the research combined with earlier studies suggests that alternative payment models contribute to greater value in care delivery.\n\nThe study also highlights one of the foremost challenges associated with the ACO model in general, the question of getting physicians on board with slowing spending growth, Arnold Milstein, M.D., of the Clinical Excellence Research Center at Stanford University, wrote in a related commentary. Healthcare organizations can improve on this front by presenting waste reduction as an ethical issue, Milstein wrote. \"Although adjusting practice to lower costs is a stretch from physicians' traditional role, the well-being of their patients and their communities now depend on it,\" he added.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services has bet heavily on the success of the Pioneer program, announcing in May that it will expand the program after it saved nearly $400 million its first two years in addition to reducing utilization rates for tests, hospitalizations and procedures. Despite these successes, numerous participants have exited the program since it began, and two of its top quality performers recently announced they may leave due to financial pressures, FierceHealthcare previously reported.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- here's the study abstract\n\n- read the commentary\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nTwo more Pioneer ACOs may leave over financial woes\n\nNext Generation ACOs: How they differ from Pioneer, MSSP models\n\nMedicare ACOs saved $411M in 2014, but few earned bonuses\n\nHHS will expand Pioneer ACO program\n\nPioneer ACO program loses three more participants\n\nPioneer ACO Atrius Health offers tips on community partnerships, sharing best practices\n\nCMS announces 'Next Generation' accountable care organization model\n\nPioneer ACO program loses three more participants\n\nSecrets to cost savings, quality improvements from high-performing Pioneer, MSSP ACOs", "article_metadata": {"description": "Medicare's Pioneer accountable care organizations led to a slight drop in \"low-value\" services their first year, according to a study published in JAMA Internal Medicine.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Medicare's Pioneer accountable care organizations led to a slight drop in \"low-value\" services their first year, according to a study published in JAMA Internal Medicine.", "title": "Pioneer ACOs reduced low-value services in year one of Medicare program", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/pioneer-acos-reduced-low-value-services-year-one-medicare-program/2015-09-24", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "cancer screenings,Care Delivery,low-value services,medical utilization,Overuse,Patient Care & Outcomes,Pioneer ACOs", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccb47\"", "article_summary": "They found that Pioneer ACOs reduced low-value service volume 1.9 percent in the program's first year, leading to a 4.5 percent drop in spending on such services.\nMedicare's Pioneer accountable care organizations (ACOs) led to a slight drop in \"low-value\" services their first year, according to a study published in JAMA Internal Medicine.\nThe reduction was more pronounced among ACOs that already provided an above-average amount of low-value services.\nThe research, Schwartz and his team noted, is limited by the fact that many organizations that volunteered for the Pioneer program were likely ahead of the curve on targeting and cutting wasteful practices.\nThe biggest reductions were among the most frequently delivered services, such as cancer screening, according to the study."}
