Savings will be made, the LAA believes, by solicitors\u2019 firms combining to make economies of scale to compensate for 17.5% cuts in fees being introduced in criminal cases.\n\nResponding to the news, Andrew Caplen, president of the Law Society, said: \u201cWe are extremely disappointed with this announcement. In our view the scheme fails to meet the ministry\u2019s own objectives of ensuring that criminal legal aid must be sustainable with enough solicitors doing criminal duty work.\n\n\u201cSome areas of the country could be left with no legal representation for anyone accused of a crime, depriving vulnerable members of the public from access to justice. We are very concerned that the ministry has not taken into account the views of the overwhelming majority of our members who responded to the consultation, or to the independent consultants who raised concerns about the economic impact on the supplier base.\u201d\n\nJon Black, president of the London Criminal Courts Solicitors\u2019 Association, said: \u201cThis is a really depressing day. The MoJ has shown that it\u2019s hell-bent on forcing through these cuts whatever the warnings, whatever the price to society and justice.\n\n\u201cCivil courts are imploding under the strain of legal aid cuts. The criminal courts are going the same way. By the time the public is really aware of the effects of this attack on our criminal justice, it will be too late,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis carve-up of solicitor contracts in police stations and magistrates\u2019 courts, combined with yet more cuts will cause terrible collateral damage. A fair defence for those who aren\u2019t wealthy will become a lottery.\n\n\u201cAs firms start to close or cut corners to keep afloat we\u2019ll see plummeting standards of defence and miscarriages of justice. It would seem that the government is unconcerned by this. But no one should be hoodwinked, it\u2019s too high a price to pay.\u201d\n\nThe shadow justice minster, Andy Slaughter, condemned the cuts. \u201cThis is a slap in the face to legal aid practitioners and is a frankly pathetic response to the consultation. This does nothing to fix the growing crisis in legal aid and only further highlights how the government are belligerently sticking to their already failing programme,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cCuts to legal aid have led to justice increasingly becoming a privilege for the wealthy few. This is all the more reason why we need a fresh review into the overall impact of the changes.\u201d\n\nAn MoJ spokesperson said: \u201cLegal aid is a vital part of our justice system. We must ensure it is available for the individuals who need it, sustainable for the lawyers who provide it, and affordable for the taxpayers who ultimately pay for it.\n\n\u201cNothing will change for anyone accused of a crime, they will still have the same access to a legally aided lawyer as they do now.\n\n\u201cWhen we began reform, we had one of the most expensive legal aid systems in the world at around \u00a32bn a year. Given the financial crisis this government inherited, we had no choice but to make significant savings. However, we do understand reform will not be easy for some lawyers, so we have introduced a range of measures to support them.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#005689", "description": "Lawyers warn government cuts will lead to miscarriages of justice, with a fair defence for the poor becoming a lottery", "application-name": "The Guardian", "author": "Owen Bowcott", "og": {"site_name": "the Guardian", "description": "Lawyers warn government cuts will lead to miscarriages of justice, with a fair defence for the poor becoming a lottery", "title": "Legal aid contracts for on-call criminal solicitors to be slashed by two-thirds", "url": "http://www.theguardian.com/law/2014/nov/27/on-call-contracts-for-criminal-solicitors-to-be-slashed-by-two-thirds", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/27/1417124888600/A-protest-against-legal-a-012.jpg?w=1200&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=0e19200e96387f283e10e86f0db0dd2e", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"app": {"url": {"ipad": "gnmguardian://law/2014/nov/27/on-call-contracts-for-criminal-solicitors-to-be-slashed-by-two-thirds?contenttype=Article&source=twitter", "googleplay": "guardian://www.theguardian.com/law/2014/nov/27/on-call-contracts-for-criminal-solicitors-to-be-slashed-by-two-thirds", "iphone": "gnmguardian://law/2014/nov/27/on-call-contracts-for-criminal-solicitors-to-be-slashed-by-two-thirds?contenttype=Article&source=twitter"}, "id": {"ipad": 409128287, "iphone": 409128287, "googleplay": "com.guardian"}, "name": {"ipad": "The Guardian", "googleplay": "The Guardian", "iphone": "The Guardian"}}, "creator": "@owenbowcott", "image": "https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/27/1417124888600/A-protest-against-legal-a-012.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@guardian"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Guardian", "al": {"ios": {"url": "gnmguardian://law/2014/nov/27/on-call-contracts-for-criminal-solicitors-to-be-slashed-by-two-thirds?contenttype=Article&source=applinks", "app_store_id": 409128287, "app_name": "The Guardian"}}, "HandheldFriendly": "True", "fb": {"app_id": 180444840287}, "theme-color": "#005689", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/favicons/f06f6996e193d1ddcd614ea852322d25/windows_tile_144_b.png", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "keywords": "Legal aid,Solicitors,UK criminal justice,Law,UK news", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theguardian", "published_time": "2014-11-27T21:49:38.000Z", "author": "https://www.theguardian.com/profile/owenbowcott", "section": "Law", "modified_time": "2014-11-27T21:49:38.000Z", "tag": "Legal aid,Solicitors,UK criminal justice,Law,UK news"}, "thumbnail": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/27/1417124888600/A-protest-against-legal-a-012.jpg?w=620&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=b1f1581514e82325641b877b5943c76a", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Legal aid,Solicitors,UK criminal justice,Law,UK news"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2667\"", "article_summary": "In our view the scheme fails to meet the ministry\u2019s own objectives of ensuring that criminal legal aid must be sustainable with enough solicitors doing criminal duty work.\n\u201cWhen we began reform, we had one of the most expensive legal aid systems in the world at around \u00a32bn a year.\nOn-call, duty contracts for criminal solicitors to attend police stations and courts will be slashed from 1,600 to 527 in England and Wales, the Ministry of Justice has confirmed.\n\u201cThis is a slap in the face to legal aid practitioners and is a frankly pathetic response to the consultation.\n\u201cCivil courts are imploding under the strain of legal aid cuts."}
