While President Obama was meeting with GloZell Green last week to discuss hooded sweatshirts, Vice President Biden appeared on Ellen Degeneres’ show to talk about the importance of getting America’s youth to sign up for the Affordable Care Act.

On the show, Biden praised Ellen for her efforts in getting young people to sign up, before explaining to her audience, which he noted was full of millennials, the importance of signing up.

“I want every mom out there to tell their adult child between the ages of 26 and 35 to sign up, for no other reason than give mom peace of mind,” said Biden. “This is changing the way people are able to live and their peace of mind so please get people to sign up.”

The Vice President then asked to reference a cue card to assist him in explaining how to obtain health insurance.

“May I do this?” he asked, before revealing details about the website that is now fully functioning. “Its easy, its finally working, the website,” quipped Biden. He then continued to disclose the details of the sign-up process.

The two also discussed President Obama’s State of the Union address last Tuesday.

“The thing I loved about his speech, he started talking about what we value, the things you’ve heard me talk about for years,” said Biden, before adding, “It’s good stuff.”

Biden then explained how he’s now a member of the “good wives club,” because he had to pretend to be interested in the President’s speech.

To close the show, Biden surprised Ellen with a special bathrobe from the White House.

“You talked about watching the State of the Union and watching me stand up. Now, next year when you watch it, I want you to be able to be comfortable,” he said. “I brought you a bathrobe with the White House Seal on it.”
