Yet, most children with autism are not diagnosed until age 4 or even older, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. If urgency is an issue, should we routinely screen all toddlers for this disorder? In a new statement, the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) says more evidence is needed to recommend universal early screening for autism.\n\nThis is not a recommendation against screening, the task force added, possibly clouding the picture for many a worried parent. The USPSTF is a volunteer panel of national experts in preventive and evidence-based medicine. Until more extensive research becomes available, these experts suggest families concerned about an individual child should discuss the situation with their health care providers, who should use their own professional judgement to decide whether and when to screen.\n\n\u201cWhile we are learning more about autism every day, there is still much we don\u2019t know about screening for autism,\u201d said Dr. David Grossman, vice chair of the task force, in a brief video accompanying the new statement.\n\nOne in Every 68 Children\n\nAutism spectrum disorder is considered a developmental disorder, meaning children with this disorder do not achieve some of the milestones of typical development or lose abilities they once had. Children with autism find it difficult to communicate with other people and are repetitive in their behavior. That said, symptoms often vary from child to child.\n\nIn fact, the term \u201cspectrum\u201d refers to autism's wide range of possible symptoms, levels of disability, and positive skills. Some children may not make eye contact, others may appear incapable of understanding simple instructions. Some become obsessed with a particular object, others demonstrate noteworthy abilities. As they age, some people with autism learn to function more or less normally, while others require substantial support to perform even basic activities.\n\nAccording to the most recent figures from the CDC, one in every 68 children is diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder. Autism occurs in every racial and ethnic group, yet boys are four to five times more likely to develop this disorder than girls. Currently, no medical tests for autism exist. To diagnose autism, a specialist assesses a person\u2019s intellectual disability and language impairment.\n\nSome doctors believe early detection is important because early treatment can help cultivate new connections around faulty neural pathways in a young child\u2019s brain. Following a careful evaluation of evidence, though, the task force shrinks from recommending universal screening for autism in young children.\n\nNot Enough Research\n\n\u201cInadequate direct evidence\u201d exists for the benefits of screening toddlers and preschool-age children when no concerns of autism have been raised by family members, caregivers, or health care professionals, the task force decided. No existing studies \u201cfocus on the clinical outcomes of children identified with ASD through screening.\u201d At the same time, the task force believes the harms of screening and subsequent interventions are likely to be small.\n\nUltimately, \u201cevidence is lacking, of poor quality, or conflicting,\u201d the members say, leading them to conclude \u201cthe balance of benefits and harms [of screening] cannot be determined.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe task force supports improved awareness of the symptoms of autism and efforts by families, clinicians, and researchers to help children with autism live a better life,\" said Grossman.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "autism spectrum test, early signs of autism, autism, young children, toddlers, screening, universal tests", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "The United States Preventive Services Task Force does not recommend universal screening of young children for autism.", "title": "Universal Screening For Autism Isn't Necessary Yet: Experts", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/autism-spectrum-test-screening-toddlers-experts-374233", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2016/02/19/toddler.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The United States Preventive Services Task Force does not recommend universal screening of young children for autism.", "title": "Universal Screening For Autism Isn't Necessary Yet: Experts", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/autism-spectrum-test-screening-toddlers-experts-374233", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2016/02/19/toddler.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2016/02/19/toddler.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Under the Hood", "published_time": "2016-02-19T14:46:49-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-19T14:46:49-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "The United States Preventive Services Task Force does not recommend universal screening of young children for autism."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9a39\"", "article_summary": "In a new statement, the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) says more evidence is needed to recommend universal early screening for autism.\nAccording to the most recent figures from the CDC, one in every 68 children is diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder.\nThis is not a recommendation against screening, the task force added, possibly clouding the picture for many a worried parent.\nFollowing a careful evaluation of evidence, though, the task force shrinks from recommending universal screening for autism in young children.\nIntensive therapy following early detection of an autism spectrum disorder is believed to lessen the severity of a child's symptoms and in some cases can help mainstream a child."}
