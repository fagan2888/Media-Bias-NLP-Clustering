And their contributions have helped us to sustain progress.\n\nThat\u2019s why, during this year\u2019s Black History Month, we recognize that just as our fight for freedom opened doors for all people, contributions by Hispanics and Latinos also enhance America\u2019s progress.\n\nOne iconic example of someone whose advocacy for the economic future of Hispanic Americans affected the entire nation is C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez. As leader of the United Farm Workers of America for 31 years, he is recognized as a hero in the Hispanic community.\n\nBut Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s championing the causes of Hispanic workers actually improved the lives of people across the land. His leadership for human dignity, fair wages and the rights of workers earned him the Presidential Medal of Freedom posthumously in 1994.\n\nVisit Mes de la Historia Afroamericana \u00bb\n\nInspired by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Ch\u00e1vez became \u201cone of our greatest advocates of nonviolent change,\u201d President Bill Clinton said while bestowing the medal.\n\nCh\u00e1vez, who founded the United Farm Workers of America in 1962, led demonstrations in the Hispanic American community at the same time that King was leading the black community. President Clinton said Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s advocacy brought \u201cdignity to the lives of so many others and provided for us inspiration for the rest of our nation\u2019s history.\u201d\n\nSen. Robert F. Kennedy described him as \u201cone of the heroic figures of our time.\u201d But Ch\u00e1vez always gave credit to those whose examples he followed. And he encouraged others to do the same in order to honor what servants learn from each other. He concluded a 1965 speech with words that still ring true today: \u201cTo truly honor Dr. King, we must do more than say words of praise. We must learn his lessons and put his views into practice so that we may truly be free at last.\u201d\n\nPhotos: Ch\u00e1vez: Oscar Castillo/C\u00e9sar E.
