Following an excellent spell behind Jon Stewart\u2019s desk in the summer of 2013, Oliver was presented with the opportunity to host his own show on HBO and he seized it with both hands.\n\nAt first blush, it seemed that HBO simply wanted a bit of The Daily Show\u2019s action, but it did not take long for Oliver to distinguish his show from his alma mater (so to speak). Oliver\u2019s Last Week Tonight returns this Sunday. The promos are promising \u201cMore of the Same!\u201d and fans couldn\u2019t be happier.\n\nOliver was always a reliable presence on The Daily Show, filling in the gap left by Stephen Colbert as \u201cVice-Captain of the Team\u201d (a role now seemingly shared by married couple Sam Bee and Jason Jones), and Stewart clearly adored the man. Last Week obviously owes many creative debts to Stewart\u2019s program, both in format and tone, but Oliver has made the show his own in unique ways that could really only have happened on HBO.\n\nRelated: John Oliver Just Won the Net Neutrality Battle\n\nFirst, broadcasting on a network that doesn\u2019t rely on commercials gives him the freedom to take on corporations that The Daily Show (or Comedy Central) might fear alienating. There is also the advantage of unrestricted language and content use (and no one can cuss like a Brit\u2026see, for instance, everything about the Russian Space Sex Geckos). But it\u2019s the \u201cdeep dive\u201d that has become the hallmark of his show and has become the key distinguishing feature from TDS.\n\nIn the build to up to his show\u2019s launch, Oliver stated that he was using 60 Minutes as a bit of a blue print, and it\u2019s clear that he relishes the chance to really tackle the intricacies of an issue rather than simply try to squeeze it all into a snarky two-minute segment. And while the venerable old dinosaur of television news is an obvious inspiration, it is really the way Oliver has been able to replicate the experience of being \u201csucked down the rabbit hole\u201d that has given him mass appeal in the Internet age.\n\nAnyone with even a passing experience on the web knows this experience even if they don\u2019t know the term. You open your browser meaning to find out a simple fact and suddenly find yourself spending two hours reading up on, say, the Celtic influence on Arthurian legend, the history of Pykrete or what the \u201886 Mets are doing now.\n\nRelated: Hollywood\u2019s Desperate Measures to Save the 2015 Season\n\nWhile Oliver\u2019s net neutrality episode (his fifth) has clearly had the largest impact, it is episode 18 that really demonstrates the inner workings of the writer\u2019s room and the appeal of the show. Oliver begins a bit about the Miss America pageant, and makes it very clear that the original intention was just to spend a minute or two on the event before moving onto a bigger story, but the more the staff dug, the more they found\u2026until it consumed the episode.\n\nWith the slightly bemused expression of a man coming out of a fever dream and wondering what happened, Oliver lifts a mountain of paper work from under his desk, the results of a week\u2019s worth of Freedom of Information Act requests to the various organizations involved. He then shares his findings and the audience gets sucked in just like the staff did.\n\nIt is one thing to say, \u201cThe Miss America pageant is retrograde, sexist and massively corrupt.\u201d The typical jaded viewer will shrug and think \u201csure.\u201d It is quite another thing to be presented with a plethora of phony scholarships, shell organizations and questionable philanthropic efforts that illustrate, detail by detail, just how messed up the pageant is. By the end of the episode, the viewer is as out of breath, shocked and confused as Oliver. It was great television.\n\nSo, on Sunday, as he rides back into the spotlight, and with the news no less wacky and horrifying than ever, the expectations will be ridiculously high. Oliver seems up to the task.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The past two years have been very good to John Oliver.", "title": "John Oliver\u2019s HBO Show Returns to Take Us Down the Rabbit Hole", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/06/John-Oliver-s-HBO-Show-Returns-Take-Us-Down-Rabbit-Hole", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/johnoliver_hbo.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/06/John-Oliver-s-HBO-Show-Returns-Take-Us-Down-Rabbit-Hole", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/johnoliver_hbo.jpg", "creator": "@DrMonkeyPHD", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The past two years have been very good to John Oliver.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd337f\"", "article_summary": "By the end of the episode, the viewer is as out of breath, shocked and confused as Oliver.\nOliver\u2019s Last Week Tonight returns this Sunday.\nAnyone with even a passing experience on the web knows this experience even if they don\u2019t know the term.\nThe past two years have been very good to John Oliver.\nBut it\u2019s the \u201cdeep dive\u201d that has become the hallmark of his show and has become the key distinguishing feature from TDS."}
