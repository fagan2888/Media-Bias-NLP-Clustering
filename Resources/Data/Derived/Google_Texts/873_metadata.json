In the latter half of 2015 and into 2016, the trend will shift for both insurers to statewide rate decreases, on average, for some small employers. However, there\u2019s no guarantee reductions will continue over the long term.\n\nFor now, at least, health plans attribute their proposed decreases to several factors. Among them is a lower-than-expected medical claims trend from when they first filed 2015-16 rates with state regulators several months ago for small employers with 50 or fewer full-time equivalent employees.\n\n\u201cWe just keep seeing better and better claims history in that population. It\u2019s improved each year,\u201d said Scott Norman, vice president of sales and client services at the Grand Rapids-based Priority Health.\n\nIn a recent rate filing to state regulators, Priority Health cites \u201csomewhat better than expected\u201d claims experience for seeking approval to implement a \u201csmall rate decrease\u201d averaging 2 percent for policies renewing in the latter half of 2015, according to an actuarial memo filed with the rate request.\n\nPriority Health then proposed to drop rates by a statewide average of 2.1 percent for 2016 for its small group HMO and point-of-service plans, according to its rate filing.\n\nWhile acknowledging the future is hard to predict, Norman expects that a continued moderation in annual rate increases \u2014 and perhaps even some decreases \u2014 could continue beyond the projected period. Initiatives to improve how well people engage in their own health and to improve the cost of care will only continue to gain more traction in the years ahead and could have further influence on the medical claims trend, he said.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of things that are coming together and need to come together, but we are definitely moving in the right direction,\u201d Norman said. \u201cI suspect as time goes on, that (the improved medical claims trend) will sustain itself throughout as we start to really focus on those things that matter the most.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re going to see continual decrease, but that moderation that you\u2019re seeing now will continue over the next three to five years.\u201d\n\nRESULTS MAY VARY\n\nAt Blue Cross Blue Shield, employers in the small group market on average would see a 3.3-percent decline in their premiums for policies renewing in the second half of the year. Employers using Blue Cross Blue Shield\u2019s HMO subsidiary, Blue Care Network, will get a nominal average premium increase of less than 1 percent for policies that renew July 1 or Oct. 1, and then a decrease in 2016.\n\nIn West Michigan, small business clients of the Blues will see their premiums decline an average of 2.9 percent from the present plan year. Blue Care Network premiums in West Michigan will increase an average of 1.4 percent under the latest rate proposal.\n\nFor Jan. 1, 2016 policy renewals, Blue Cross Blue Shield proposed a 2.2 percent average decrease statewide, and an average 4.8 percent decrease for Blue Care Network policies. In West Michigan small businesses could see premiums decrease an average of 1.35 percent for Blues policies and 3.95 percent for Blue Care Network in 2016.\n\nBlue Cross Blue Shield had previously proposed an average 2 percent rate increase for policies renewing with the third and fourth quarters.\n\nActual premiums adjustments will vary \u2014 in some cases widely \u2014 based on employers\u2019 benefits packages and where they are located in the state. Averages also are calculated prior to employers making any changes in their benefits packages when they renew policies.\n\nIn 2014, some employers experienced significant volatility in rates as new underwriting criteria kicked in with the Affordable Care Act, causing wide fluctuations in rate increases and decreases between individual employers well above or below reported averages.\n\n\u201cThat volatility inside the average is something we haven\u2019t seen before,\u201d said Shannon Enders of Lakeshore Employee Benefits in Norton Shores.\n\nVOLATILITY REMAINS\n\nEnders reports premiums increases averaging in the mid-single digits for midyear policy renewals. Small employers still using a health plan that does not comply with the coverage mandates of the ACA could face rate volatility when they do convert, he said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s still going to be some bumps in the road for those (employers) going forward,\u201d Enders said.\n\nWhile rate increases have moderated of late, Enders also notes that in the 20 years he\u2019s been in the business, he has seen cycles come and go. The rate proposals from Blue Cross Blue Shield and Priority Health could reflect both an underwriting cycle and changes occurring in the industry that are affecting the medical claims trend, he said, noting rate spikes could still return.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have a couple good years, we\u2019ll have a couple bad years,\u201d Enders said. \u201cThat will go back and forth.\u201d\n\nIn West Michigan, the average premium for health insurance was $13,860 for a family policy in 2014, more than 17 percent higher than just four years earlier, according to the annual survey of health care costs by The Employers\u2019 Association and the Alliance for Health that spans employers of all sizes.\n\nBETTER COORDINATION\n\nOther factors affecting medical claims trends that directly drive annual premium adjustments include the move over the last decade to high-deductible health plans and having employees share more of the cost of coverage, the adoption of workplace wellness by employers to improve employee health, and efforts by insurers and providers to improve care coordination and manage high-cost chronic medical diseases.\n\nPriority Health attributes 80 percent of its medical claims to members who have one or more chronic medical condition such as diabetes, asthma or cardiovascular disease.\n\nAn April article in the industry publication Health Affairs highlighted a study on Blue Cross Blue Shield\u2019s patient-centered medical home initiative that\u2019s credited with avoiding $50 million in costs in 2013 through improved care coordination and management.\n\nBlue Cross Blue Shield also reports that its patient-centered medical home initiative that involved 1,420 physician practices and more than 4,000 doctors generated $155 million in cost savings over a three-year period from 2011 to 2013 because of the ER visits and hospital stays that were avoided.\n\nOBAMACARE\u2019S IMPACT?\n\nThe federal Affordable Care Act, by requiring all health insurers to accept all people seeking coverage no matter their health status, also has eased adverse selection, which Blue Cross Blue Shield says left it with a risk pool that had been the costliest to insure. Prior to the ACA\u2019s passage, Blue Cross Blue Shield was the only carrier in Michigan required by state law to issue policies to everyone.\n\n\u201cThe ACA has definitely put some stability into how the rates are set,\u201d said Nicole Winters-Smith, director of business segment performance for Blue Cross Blue Shield\u2019s middle and small group sales. \u201cThere is no longer an opportunity for other carriers to (set rates) based on previous conditions or to even exclude coverage based on pre-existing conditions. Everybody has the same factors to rate with. So that does level the playing field a bit.\u201d\n\nNationally, an annual outlook issued last June by PricewaterhouseCoopers\u2019 Health Research Institute noted that the medical cost trend across the U.S. had experienced slow growth for the previous five years, a trend that \u201cleft many wondering whether health care costs were bound to run away again.\u201d\n\nThe PwC report projected net medical costs for the U.S. to rise 4.8 percent in 2015, a slight uptick after five years of significantly slower growth, \u201cbut it does not guarantee a return to the double-digit increases of the past.\n\n\u201cIn fact, the contained growth is evidence that structural changes aimed at delivering better quality care at lower costs are starting to hold health care spending growth in check,\u201d the PwC report stated.\n\nOver the long term, the cost of health premiums will depend on the medical claims trends and decisions individuals make when seeking care, Norman said. He notes Priority Health\u2019s push for transparency in health care pricing could help as it allows consumers to look up the cost of an elective procedure beforehand and compare care providers based on price and quality.\n\n\u201cA lot of it depends on us. A lot of it depends on how accountable we are as consumers of health care and making sure we\u2019re doing things to stay healthy and being good consumers,\u201d Norman said. \u201cIf we want to be sustainable, these are the things that have to happen long term.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "After years of steadily rising rates for employee health coverage, small employers may finally get a little relief this year and next from the steep i...", "generator": "runengine.com", "title": "Health insurance premiums moderate \u2014 even decline \u2014 after years of steep increases", "og": {"url": "https://mibiz.com/item/22445-health-insurance-premiums-moderate-%E2%80%94-even-decline-%E2%80%94-after-years-of-steep-increases", "image": "http://mibiz.com/media/k2/items/cache/87841eab0aba86e10e48d7c60af1a734_XL.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "After years of steadily rising rates for employee health coverage, small employers may finally get a little relief this year and next from the steep i...", "title": "Health insurance premiums moderate \u2014 even decline \u2014 after years of steep increases"}, "image": "https://mibiz.com/media/k2/items/cache/87841eab0aba86e10e48d7c60af1a734_S.jpg", "rights": "www.MiBiz.com", "author": "Mark Sanchez", "keywords": "Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan,Priority Health,Blue Care Network,Lakeshore Employee Benefits,The Employers\u2019 Association,Alliance for Health", "original-source": "https://mibiz.com/item/22445-health-insurance-premiums-moderate-%E2%80%94-even-decline-%E2%80%94-after-years-of-steep-increases"}, "article_summary": "Prior to the ACA\u2019s passage, Blue Cross Blue Shield was the only carrier in Michigan required by state law to issue policies to everyone.\nBlue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan, Priority Health and others propose to trim premiums for health policies that renew in the third and fourth quarters of 2015 or on Jan. 1, 2016.\nAfter years of steadily rising rates for employee health coverage, small employers may finally get a little relief this year and next from the steep increases of the past.\nFor Jan. 1, 2016 policy renewals, Blue Cross Blue Shield proposed a 2.2 percent average decrease statewide, and an average 4.8 percent decrease for Blue Care Network policies.\nBlue Cross Blue Shield had previously proposed an average 2 percent rate increase for policies renewing with the third and fourth quarters."}
