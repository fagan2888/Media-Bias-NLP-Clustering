It contends that California\u2019s Department of Managed Health Care discriminated against those morally opposed to abortion and requests an investigation.\n\nThe complaint is under review, said Rachel Seeger, spokeswoman for the federal agency\u2019s Office for Civil Rights.\n\nThe state agency didn\u2019t immediately comment.\n\nThe Catholic conference is challenging a directive the state managed care agency sent Aug. 22 to seven insurance companies. It said that California\u2019s Constitution and a 1975 state law prohibited them from selling group plans that exclude coverage for legal abortions.\n\n\u201cAbortion is a basic health care service,\u201d department director Michelle Rouillard wrote in the letter.\n\nThe civil rights complaint contends that the directive targeted Catholic-run institutions, including Santa Clara University and Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles.\n\nThe schools notified employees last fall that they planned to stop paying for elective abortions, but said faculty and staff members could pay for supplemental coverage that would be provided through a third party.\n\nThe complaint argues that the state action violates the federal Weldon Amendment, which allows the government to withhold federal funding from agencies, programs and state or local governments that discriminate against doctors, hospitals or insurers that don\u2019t offer abortion coverage.\n\n\u201cFor the first time in California \u2013 indeed, for the first time anywhere in the United States \u2013 health plans are now required, as a matter of regulatory fiat, to cover all legal abortions, even late-term abortions, for any reason,\u201d the complaint stated.\n\n\u201cIt is a flagrant violation of their civil rights and deepest moral convictions, and is government coercion of the worst kind.\u201d,\u201d said a statement from Bishop Robert McElroy, auxiliary bishop of the Archdiocese of San Francisco and chair of the Institutional Concerns Committee of the California Catholic Conference.\n\nThe conference represents the archbishops of Los Angeles and San Francisco, and the bishops of Fresno, Monterey, Oakland, Orange, Sacramento, San Bernardino, San Diego, San Jose, Santa Rosa and Stockton.\n\nThe group \u201cis the official voice of the 10 million Catholics and their many parishes, schools, universities, social service agencies in California,\u201d according to a conference press statement.\n\nClashes between governments and religious groups have intensified in recent years over birth control coverage, abortion and religious freedom. Dozens of U.S. Roman Catholic dioceses, charities and colleges have sued in federal court over the contraceptive coverage required under the federal Affordable Care Act.\n\nSeveral evangelical nonprofits have also sued, arguing some of the birth control methods covered under the law are tantamount to abortion. Last June, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the Hobby Lobby chain and other closely held private businesses with religious objections could opt out of the birth control mandate.\n\nCopyright 2014 The Associated Press.", "article_metadata": {"description": "California's Catholic leadership has filed a federal civil rights complaint over a state requirement that health insurance cover abortions.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://sacramento.cbslocal.com/2014/10/01/california-catholics-challenge-abortion-order/", "image": {"width": 1500, "secure_url": "https://cbssacramento.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/163600181.jpg?w=1500", "identifier": "https://cbssacramento.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/163600181.jpg?w=1500", "height": 1000}, "type": "article", "description": "California's Catholic leadership has filed a federal civil rights complaint over a state requirement that health insurance cover abortions.", "title": "California Catholics Challenge Abortion Order"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://cbssacramento.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/163600181.jpg?w=1500", "description": "California's Catholic leadership has filed a federal civil rights complaint over a state requirement that health insurance cover abortions.", "site": "/social/", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "California Catholics Challenge Abortion Order"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "News, Sports, Weather, Traffic and the Best of Sacramento", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "CBS Sacramento", "article": {"publisher": "http://sacramento.cbslocal.com/social/", "author": "http://sacramento.cbslocal.com/social/"}, "keywords": "california news, local, news, abortion, loyola marymount university, santa clara university", "google-site-verification": "44caXBf4kjHeKKAT7ZZ89NaCX25utL_yRSa-qGpwIhY", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://sacramento.cbslocal.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/1e592dab1a834e9f02fdb648f19487a6?s=16", "news_keywords": "abortion, loyola marymount university, santa clara university"}, "article_summary": "It contends that California\u2019s Department of Managed Health Care discriminated against those morally opposed to abortion and requests an investigation.\n\u201cAbortion is a basic health care service,\u201d department director Michelle Rouillard wrote in the letter.\nThe California Catholic Conference, which represents the state\u2019s bishops and archbishops, sent a letter Tuesday to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\nThe Catholic conference is challenging a directive the state managed care agency sent Aug. 22 to seven insurance companies.\nSAN FRANCISCO (AP) \u2013 California\u2019s Catholic leadership has filed a federal civil rights complaint over a state requirement that health insurance cover abortions."}
