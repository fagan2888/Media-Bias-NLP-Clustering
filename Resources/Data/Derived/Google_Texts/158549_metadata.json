Queens Boulevard is one of four New York City streets being targeted for a $250 million safety redesign under a plan from New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio to lower pedestrian deaths. Andrew Hinderaker for The Wall Street Journal\n\nFour New York City streets are being targeted for a $250 million safety redesign under a plan by New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s administration to lower pedestrian deaths.\n\nThe overhaul would include significant sections of Queens Boulevard, 4th Avenue in Brooklyn, Grand Concourse in the Bronx, and Atlantic Avenue in the East New York area of Brooklyn, city officials said.\n\nThe city plans to \u201ccomprehensively reimagine and redesign these corridors into safer, greener and more attractive roadways for residents and businesses,\u201d Department of Transportation Commissioner Polly Trottenberg said Thursday in a budget hearing before the City Council.\n\nAll four of the streets are major thoroughfares, and are considered to be some of the most hazardous for pedestrians in the five boroughs. Twelve pedestrians were killed and 43 seriously injured on Queens Boulevard between 2009 and 2013, for example, while 12 pedestrians were killed and 58 seriously injured on Grand Concourse, according to city officials.\n\nMs. Trottenberg said the city plans to spend $100 million alone on redesigning Queens Boulevard.\n\nThe city plans to add expanded pedestrian space, medians, trees, and dedicated bike paths under the program, called the \u201cVision Zero Great Streets\u201d initiative, along the thoroughfares by 2017.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Four New York City streets are being targeted for a $250 million safety redesign under a plan by New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio's administration to lower pedestrian deaths.", "title": "NYC Streets Targeted for Redesign After Pedestrian Deaths", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2015/03/06/nyc-streets-targeted-for-redesign-after-pedestrian-deaths/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-HH026_NYSTRE_P_20150306125205.jpg"}, "site": "WSJNY", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "New York", "article.headline": "NYC Streets Targeted for Redesign After Pedestrian Deaths", "description": "Four New York City streets are being targeted for a $250 million safety redesign under a plan by New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio's administration to lower pedestrian deaths.", "article_section": "New York", "author": "Mara Gay", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Metropolis Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Metropolis", "article.summary": "Four New York City streets are being targeted for a $250 million safety redesign under a plan by New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio's administration to lower pedestrian deaths.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2015-03-06T18:11:17-05:00", "dj.asn": "10-157", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2015/03/06/nyc-streets-targeted-for-redesign-after-pedestrian-deaths/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-METROB-22652", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "New York", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Four New York City streets are being targeted for a $250 million safety redesign under a plan by New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio's administration to lower pedestrian deaths.", "title": "NYC Streets Targeted for Redesign After Pedestrian Deaths", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2015/03/06/nyc-streets-targeted-for-redesign-after-pedestrian-deaths/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-HH026_NYSTRE_P_20150306125205.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Metropolis", "article.id": "BL-METROB-22652", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2015-03-06T18:11:17-05:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2bfa\"", "article_summary": "Queens Boulevard is one of four New York City streets being targeted for a $250 million safety redesign under a plan from New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio to lower pedestrian deaths.\nAndrew Hinderaker for The Wall Street JournalFour New York City streets are being targeted for a $250 million safety redesign under a plan by New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s administration to lower pedestrian deaths.\nPedestrians cross over Queens Boulevard in the Rego Park neighborhood of Queens.\nThe city plans to add expanded pedestrian space, medians, trees, and dedicated bike paths under the program, called the \u201cVision Zero Great Streets\u201d initiative, along the thoroughfares by 2017.\nMs. Trottenberg said the city plans to spend $100 million alone on redesigning Queens Boulevard."}
