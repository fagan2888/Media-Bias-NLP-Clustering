I think the president is going to get hurt on one of these trips overseas.\u201d\n\nThe WND Superstore has Dan Bongino\u2019s fascinating insider story, \u201cLife Inside the Bubble.\u201d\n\nHe recalled that he had five days to do a preliminary security trip to Prague in 2010 for Obama\u2019s signing of the START treaty with Russia. Ideally, he said, he and his colleagues would have had 20 to 25 days to prepare.\n\nThe sign-language interpreter for Obama and other world leaders at Nelson Mandela\u2019s memorial service Tuesday, Thamsanqa Jantjie, said in interviews published today he frequently has been violent and was hospitalized in a mental health facility for more than a year. He said he is officially classified as disabled by the government because of his schizophrenia.\n\nJantjie, who has been accused of using fake signs that amounted to gibberish, said he suffered a schizophrenic episode while on stage in which he had visions of angels.\n\nRead about the sign language interpreter\u2019s vision of \u201cangels.\u201d\n\nBongino noted there also were problems at the Mandela memorial site, FNB Stadium in Johannesburg, with the magnetometer security screening checkpoints.\n\n\u201cThese are really serious security failures on [South Africa\u2019s] part,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if we can place that degree of trust in some of these international security teams any more.\u201d\n\nThe Secret Service can fill in the holes on longer trips, he noted, and bring in other assets, such as military personnel.\n\n\u201cOn short trips like this, it\u2019s impossible to catch everything,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I think we need to be willing to pull the plug on it.\u201d\n\nHearing voices\n\nThe South African government reportedly was investigating whether the interpreter had been vetted before the memorial.\n\nIn an interview with Johannesburg\u2019s Star newspaper, Jantjie said it was possible that the magnitude of the event triggered the purported schizophrenic episode in which he started hearing voices and hallucinating.\n\nHe told the South African paper he then lost concentration and it was all downhill from there.\n\n\u201cThere was nothing I could do. I was alone in a very dangerous situation,\u201d he said. \u201cI tried to control myself and not show the world what was going on. I am very sorry. It\u2019s the situation I found myself in.\u201d\n\nBongino, who resigned from the Presidential Protective Division in 2011, joined the Secret Service in 1999 as a special agent assigned to investigate financial crimes.\n\nIn 2006, he became a member of the Presidential Protective Division in the administration of President George W. Bush and remained on protective duty during the change in administration to Obama.\n\nHe is now is running for Congress in Maryland\u2019s Sixth District.\n\nBongino was featured on BBC World News television today and will be a guest on Jake Tapper\u2019s CNN program at 4:30 p.m. Eastern.\n\nIn his book, Bongino, 39, said it seemed to him as he served the president as a Secret Service agent that the Obama White House staff \u201clived in a utopian bubble devoid of any acknowledgment of real-world consequences.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey spoke of policies in an idealistic way, rather than how to apply legislative solutions to the real world,\u201d he writes. \u201cWhen a policy not only failed to produce the desired result but in some cases produced the exact opposite result, it was ignored.\u201d\n\nHe writes that the administration \u201clooks on with a blind eye, seemingly proud of its good intentions yet complete lack of results.\u201d\n\nBongino told WND in a previous interview that because President Obama and his staff seem to care more about \u201cgood intentions\u201d and political posturing than sound policy and have little respect for the constraints of executive power, the Obamacare disaster is about to get much worse for Americans.\n\nHe explains in his book that \u201cmany of the bureaucrats and staffers within the Washington, D.C., bubble who had a role in the design of Obamacare legislation were well aware of the media reports about the unpopularity of this legislation, and in an effort to save their careers, they relayed a completely different message to the president.\u201d\n\nBongino, citing clear statements Obama and other Democrat leaders have made, is certain that the intent of Obamacare all along was to move the country toward a single-payer, or socialized, medical system run by the government.\n\nObamacare itself, he argued, is private insurance \u201cin name only.\u201d\n\n\u201cOnce you can own the mechanics of the private insurance industry through state exchanges, you can tax and regulate them to death, and you, effectively, already have a single-payer system,\u201d he told WND.\n\nContract with the people\n\nAs WND reported, Bongino, in his run for Congress, is \u201csigning a contract\u201d with citizens \u2013 featured on the splash page of his website \u2013 to help him avoid the corruption into which so many lawmakers fall in the nation\u2019s capital. He has the endorsement of former Rep. Allen West, R-Fla., who said Bongino left the Secret Service at the height of his success \u201cbecause he is an American patriot and the embodiment of the highest standards of honor, integrity and character \u2026 exactly what we need inside the bubble.\u201d\n\nWatch Bongino\u2019s interview with Sean Hannity on Fox News:\n\nIn his book, Bongino says his \u201cpath into politics had a clear mission: to sound the alarm on what I had learned living inside the \u2018D.C. bubble\u2019 by highlighting the very real consequences of an ever-expanding government and its insulated bureaucracy.\u201d\n\nBongino began his career in law enforcement with the NYPD in 1995.\n\nWatch the trailer for the book here:\n\nSee Bongino talk about his solutions:\n\nHear him discuss \u201cLife Inside the Bubble\u201d:\n\nGet Dan Bongino\u2019s \u201cLife Inside the Bubble.\u201d\n\nMedia wishing to interview Dan Bongino contact us here.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "Allowing a mental-health patient with violent tendencies to stand next to the president of the United States was a \u201cmajor security lapse,\u201d charges a former member of President Obama\u2019s elite Presidential Protective Division of the Secret Service. \u201cWe need to re-evaluate dignitary protection for our people overseas,\u201d said Dan Bongino, author of the newly released [\u2026]", "title": "Ex-Obama agent: Fake interpreter \u2018major security lapse\u2019", "url": "http://www.wnd.com/2013/12/ex-obama-agent-fake-interpreter-major-security-lapse/", "image": "http://www.wnd.com/files/2013/12/339542_Obama-interpreter1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 152299868169938}, "google-site-verification": "5iw1bKISvQcI1qRwIskRfer6GKV4jUf6LImfS9bhaeI", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd01aa\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI think these (short-notice) trips are a mistake,\u201d Bongino told WND.\nWithout the time it takes to do a thorough check, the Secret Service must rely to a large extent on the host government\u2019s security forces, he said.\nIt\u2019s the situation I found myself in.\u201dBongino, who resigned from the Presidential Protective Division in 2011, joined the Secret Service in 1999 as a special agent assigned to investigate financial crimes.\nAllowing a mental-health patient with violent tendencies to stand next to the president of the United States was a \u201cmajor security lapse,\u201d charges a former member of President Obama\u2019s elite Presidential Protective Division of the Secret Service.\n\u201cThese are really serious security failures on [South Africa\u2019s] part,\u201d he said."}
