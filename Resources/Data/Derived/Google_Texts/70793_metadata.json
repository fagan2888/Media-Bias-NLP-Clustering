Manning and his three, first-half touchdown passes were left on the sidelines through most of the second half by a Denver defense that couldn\u2019t get off the field on third-and-long.\n\n\u201cIt was a strange second half,\u201d Manning said.\n\nThe first half was typical Manning. On the first play, he threw a 48-yard completion to Emmanuel Sanders, who ran a post route. Manning later threw touchdown passes to Julius Thomas, Jacob Tamme and Demaryius Thomas.\n\nEntering the intermission, Manning had completed 15-of-19 passes for 191 yards and a remarkable 148.1 passer rating.\n\nTalk about a guy sitting on his stats. In the second half, Manning essentially got the ball twice. The first time was after the Chiefs kept the ball for 19 plays and the first 10 minutes of the third quarter.\n\nLuckily for the Broncos, the Chiefs have a rookie placekicker in Cairo Santos who is not yet ready for NFL pressure. Santos missed a field-goal attempt and couldn\u2019t kick a touchback on a kickoff in altitude, allowing a nice return by Andre Caldwell that set up a Broncos\u2019 field goal.\n\nThe three points was all Manning and the Broncos\u2019 offense mustered in the second half. Can\u2019t score when you don\u2019t have the ball. The Chiefs kept the ball nearly 8 minutes to begin the fourth quarter, then for nearly the final 3 \u00bd minutes of the game.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been in games before like that,\u201d said Manning, who has six touchdown passes and zero interceptions through two games this season, and 497 scoring passes in his career. \u201cCertainly, on third down you get excited when it\u2019s third-and-long. You start warming up and you\u2019re getting ready to get out there.\u201d\n\nPHOTOS: Kansas City Chiefs vs. Denver Broncos at Mile High\n\nWATCH: Denver Broncos bend but don\u2019t break against Kansas City Chiefs\n\nIn the second half, Chiefs quarterback Alex Smith converted third downs of 18, 11, 13, 8, 13 and 9 yards.\n\nYet, Smith\u2019s clutch play wasn\u2019t enough to overcome what Manning put together in the first half. Same with Indianapolis Colts\u2019 quarterback Andrew Luck the previous week. Luck played well in the second half, but Manning built a 24-0 lead in the first.\n\n\u201cSure, we\u2019re always looking to play that four-quarter game,\u201d Manning said. \u201cIt\u2019s something we\u2019ll keep striving for.\u201d\n\nMike Klis: mklis@denverpost.com; Twitter: @mikeklis", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Broncos\u2019 Peyton Manning good vs. Chiefs, but not on field enough", "title": "Broncos\u2019 Peyton Manning good vs. Chiefs, but not on field enough", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/09/14/broncos-peyton-manning-good-vs-chiefs-but-not-on-field-enough/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140914__SMITH-MANNINGp1-1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140914__SMITH-MANNINGp1-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-14T19:54:17+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T05:55:53+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdda09\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIt was a strange second half,\u201d Manning said.\nImagine the kind of game Peyton Manning could have had if he wasn\u2019t benched in the second half.\nLuck played well in the second half, but Manning built a 24-0 lead in the first.\nManning and his three, first-half touchdown passes were left on the sidelines through most of the second half by a Denver defense that couldn\u2019t get off the field on third-and-long.\nIn the second half, Manning essentially got the ball twice."}
