If cannabis were legal many of these people wouldn\u2019t have tried Spice in the first place; in fact, there might not have ever been a market demand that led to the creation and marketing of Spice.\n\nNo matter what your views on cannabis, it doesn\u2019t make you walk around like a zombie and scream at people.\n\nOf course there will always be a small group of people who will try anything if they think it will get them high; bath salts, keyboard cleaner, cough syrup. But people try \u201csynthetic marijuana\u201d and ingest unknown chemicals without really knowing what the effects will be. People assume they are just going to get high and chill; but many of these people now know differently and some of them have paid for that knowledge with their life.\n\nProhibition causes so much harm, even in ways that can\u2019t be seen until it\u2019s too late.
