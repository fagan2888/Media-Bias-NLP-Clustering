Tom Price, Georgia Republican, said members are leaning toward welfare reform as the best use of the tool, known as budget reconciliation. The process lets them pass revenue-related legislation on a majority vote in the Senate and avoid the type of Democratic filibuster that\u2019s doomed a series of GOP efforts, including Wednesday\u2019s bid to beef up scrutiny of Syrian refugees.\n\nEarlier this week, the top Democrat on the Budget Committee warned Mr. Price not to stray from the pact that Congress and Mr. Obama reached in October to lift the \u201csequester\u201d spending caps that the parties agreed to in 2011. The GOP used an overseas war fund to secure extra money for defense spending, yet Democrats already fear that Republicans will backslide on their commitments to domestic programs.\n\nSEE ALSO: The Washington Times to co-host March 10 GOP presidential debate\n\n\u201cI urge you to resist efforts to renege on this agreement with a budget resolution that reduces discretionary spending to a level that again diminishes our ability to sustain our economic recovery and give American families opportunities to thrive,\u201d Rep. Nita D. Lowey of New York said in a letter to the chairman.\n\nMr. Price said he planned to abide by the agreement in his fiscal 2017 plan.\n\n\u201cWhat the leadership has charged us with doing is writing a budget to the letter of the law,\u201d he told reporters.\n\nSEE ALSO: Loretta Lynch backs Obama on \u2018common sense\u2019 gun rules: Executive actions within his authority\n\nConservatives fumed after a tax-cut deal struck by Mr. Obama and House Speaker Paul D. Ryan last month put a major dent in the federal budget, helping to send the deficit soaring by 24 percent, according to the Congressional Budget Office figures released Tuesday.\n\nThe $544 billion deficit projected for 2016 marks the first year since 2009 that the red ink has grown, and it powers the deficit back up over the half-trillion mark, where it had been for most of Mr. Obama\u2019s tenure.\n\nMr. Price said reconciliation would allow the GOP to tackle the deficit without flouting the budget deal.\n\nRepublicans successfully used the process in recent weeks to put an Obamacare repeal on Mr. Obama\u2019s desk for the first time. Though the president vetoed the effort, it served as a model for the GOP to use the tool again.\n\n\u201cI think that was a positive experience for folks in the House and Senate on our side on the aisle,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Price plans to move his budget out of committee during the last week of February, clearing the way for floor action by the first week of March.\n\nRepublicans\u2019 plan will include an Obamacare repeal, as it has in previous years, but it will use reconciliation to offer a new contrast to Mr. Obama and his Democratic allies in a pivotal election year.\n\nMr. Price said their reforms will serve as a \u201cbeacon\u201d to whoever emerges from a raucous GOP nominating race for president.\n\nRepublican leaders have shirked questions about how they would handle a firebrand nominee like businessman Donald Trump. Instead, they\u2019ve promised a clear, conservative agenda that should sync up with whoever GOP voters pick.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re going to do. Take our conservative principles, apply them to the problems of the day, present the country with solutions so that they can make a choice, and whoever our nominee is going to be, we think will carry that forward,\u201d Mr. Ryan, Wisconsin Republican, said at the GOP\u2019s retreat in Baltimore last week.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Kentucky Republican, has more modest goals. He wants to finish the appropriations process this year, so Congress doesn\u2019t resort to the type of catch-all \u201comnibus\u201d bills that lawmakers have needed in recent years to keep the government open.", "article_metadata": {"description": "House Republicans will write their 2017 budget to the maximum level of spending set out in last year's budget deal, but will try to come back and cut spending later this year using the same fast-track tool they turned to in trying to repeal Obamacare, the House Budget Committee chairman said Wednesday.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "House Republicans will write their 2017 budget to the maximum level of spending set out in last year\u2019s budget deal, but will try to come back and cut spending later this year using the same fast-track tool they turned to in trying to repeal Obamacare, the House Budget Committee chairman said Wednesday.", "title": "House Republicans eye reconciliation to trim 2017 budget", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/jan/20/house-republicans-reconciliation-to-trim-2017-budg/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/04/09/Price.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/04/09/Price.jpg", "description": "House Republicans will write their 2017 budget to the maximum level of spending set out in last year's budget deal, but will try to come back and cut spending later this year using the same fast-track", "card": "summary", "title": "House Republicans eye reconciliation to trim 2017 budget"}, "Author": "Tom Howell Jr.", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Business Finance, Congress, Senate, Republican Party"}, "article_summary": "Mr. Price said he planned to abide by the agreement in his fiscal 2017 plan.\nMr. Price said reconciliation would allow the GOP to tackle the deficit without flouting the budget deal.\nMr. Price said their reforms will serve as a \u201cbeacon\u201d to whoever emerges from a raucous GOP nominating race for president.\nRepublicans\u2019 plan will include an Obamacare repeal, as it has in previous years, but it will use reconciliation to offer a new contrast to Mr. Obama and his Democratic allies in a pivotal election year.\nRep.
