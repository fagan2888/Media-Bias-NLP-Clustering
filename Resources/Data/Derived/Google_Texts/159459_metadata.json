(WTVR) -- The Affordable Care Act, by design and even by its name, is meant to give Virginians who can't afford health insurance the ability to purchase it.\n\nBut Lillie Estes, a Richmond community strategist who made less than $15,000 last year, is finding insurance just as unattainable and unaffordable as ever.\n\nWhy?\n\nEstes falls in what is known as the \"Medicaid Gap\" - a group of Virginians who do not qualify for Medicaid but are too poor for the so-called Obamacare tax credits.\n\n\"I see a challenge that needs to be addressed,\" Estes told CBS 6 reporter Joe St. George.\n\nAffordable Care Act tax credits begin when someone makes 138-percent of the poverty level, or about $15,800 a year.\n\nMedicaid in Virginia ends for many families when they make more than $6,000 dollars a year.\n\nMedicaid ended for Estes when her son turned 18.\n\nWhy is there this gap? When the Affordable Care Act passed in March of 2010, the federal government expanded Medicaid to reduce the gap. But the Supreme Court ruled that part of the law unconstitutional, allowing states not to expand Medicaid if they so wish.\n\nTherefore 25 states have thus not expanded Medicaid, Virginia being one of them.\n\n\"There is not a great deal of trust that the money would be there,\" Governor Bob McDonnell told CBS 6 reporter Joe St. George.\n\nMcDonnell said his thoughts on Medicaid expansion are unchanged.\n\nWhile McDonnell acknowledged the federal government would cover 100 percent of the expansion for the first three years, the Governor said beyond that it's unclear, fearing a large, unfunded mandate would be dropped on Virginia's budget.\n\n\"Medicaid has expanded 1600 percent in Virginia in the last thirty years,\" McDonnell said.\n\n\"The federal government can't even get a budget passed - they can't even get a spending deal for 90 days,\" McDonnell added.\n\nThe issue of medicaid expansion and reducing the \"gap\" has been a hot topic on the campaign trail.\n\nDemocrat Terry McAuliffe says he would pressure lawmakers to expand it. Republican Ken Cuccinelli says he sides with current Governor McDonnell and would not support expansion.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Affordable Care Act, by design and even by its name, is meant to give Virginians who can't afford health insurance the ability to purchase it.
