But Thursday\u2019s deadline drama offered no signal of party unity, only fresh reminders of the post-election divisions between a president who\u2019s looking to govern during his last two years in office and a newly invigorated populist wing of the party, led by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.).\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe $1.1 trillion spending bill passed the House late Thursday, with 57 Democrats voting for the bill while 139 voted against it \u2014 with many liberals seething over a provision that rolled back a key financial regulation that is part of the Dodd-Frank law.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Down to the wire)\n\n\u201cA vote for this bill is a vote for future taxpayer bailouts of Wall Street,\u201d Warren said Thursday. \u201cIt is time for all of us to stand up and fight.\u201d\n\nObama and Biden dialed for votes all day, and dispatched Obama Chief of Staff Denis McDonough to meet with House Democrats, hoping to sooth Democrats\u2019 concerns over policy riders that showed up in the trillion-dollar spending bill and were blasted by liberal stalwarts Warren and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.).\n\nWhile the eleventh-hour intervention may have pushed the bill across the finish line, it also sparked a fresh round of finger-pointing among Democrats on Capitol Hill and in the White House. For the increasingly liberal factions of Democrats on Capitol Hill, the White House\u2019s work was too little, too late.\n\n\u201cI do not share the White House\u2019s view,\u201d said Rep. Steve Israel of New York, a member of Democratic leadership after meeting with McDonough.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Tea party fumes over campaign finance plan)\n\nObama\u2019s base said he tried to sell them out\u2014and didn\u2019t even wait to do it until Republicans officially expand their majority in the House and take over the Senate come January. And some on the left worried the wide range of policy riders in a spending bill were a worrisome sign as Republicans take over the Senate next year \u2013 and are already urging Obama to steel himself and ready his veto pen for what\u2019s to come.\n\n\u201cWe gave Democrats in the House multiple opportunities to negotiate the best deal they could get,\u201d White House press secretary Josh Earnest said late Thursday on MSNBC, explaining why the president and others were whipping votes. \u201cThe good news is they got a pretty good deal.\u201d\n\nFew liberals saw things his way. The White House\u2019s support for the measure sent them into a rage, including a very rare and blunt split between Pelosi and the president which began when a White House statement landed in Washington inboxes on Thursday afternoon. The message from the president: The bill has plenty to scoff at, but you should vote for it anyway.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m enormously disappointed the White House feels the only way they could get a bill is to go along with this,\u201d Pelosi said Thursday afternoon, coming to the floor to declare that she wouldn\u2019t be voting for the bill so long as it includes the Dodd-Frank rollback \u201cblackmail.\u201d\n\nEarnest said that while Obama has his problems with what\u2019s in the bill, he was enthusiastic about the negotiations that led to the final deal, including several Democratic priorities.\n\n\u201cThis is the kind of compromise the president\u2019s been seeking from Republicans for years now,\u201d Earnest said.\n\nA year ago, Republicans were willing to shut down the government over trying to defund Obamacare. But by taking the shutdown off the table this time around, Obama enabled Republicans to slip in several measures that liberals hate, including major campaign finance changes he opposes and a rollback of a Dodd-Frank financial regulation he fought so hard to get.\n\nAfter meeting with McDonough, several Democrats said the White House had done nothing to change anyone\u2019s minds. Fighting the battle later was better than compromising now \u2014 the opposite argument that was coming from the White House.\n\n\u201cIf I go home and say \u2018well, I had to vote to give new special favors to billionaires and the big Wall Street banks who destroyed the economy and my district\u2019s still hurting, because otherwise, we would\u2019ve had a 90-day CR.\u2019 You know what they\u2019re gonna say? \u2018What the hell is a 90-day CR?\u2019\u201d said Rep. Peter DeFazio (D-Ore.), referring to a three-month extension of government funding called a continuing resolution.\n\nThough Pelosi was the star of the Democratic revolt, she had major air support on the other side of the Capitol from Warren, who for a second consecutive day railed against the legislation that the White House was pushing. The message from the two was clear: Hold the line.\n\n\u201cDemocrats don\u2019t want it in,\u201d Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) told POLITICO. \u201cI don\u2019t know a Democrat that wants it in at all.\u201d\n\nIn his first big showdown with Congress since the Republican romp in the midterms, Obama chose to stick with his standard of letting the Hill work out the funding, largely playing defense instead of offense, at least until the last minute. The result \u2014 a bill tilted heavily toward Republican priorities \u2014 was a compromise that the White House said Obama was eager to sign as soon as he could get it.\n\nSo instead of touting major wins on the spending bill, the White House had to push smaller victories, like money to fight Ebola and extra funding to fight ISIS.\n\nEarly childhood education, funding for climate action \u2014 those are things they wanted, White House aides repeatedly insisted in the last few days. They got funding for the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. And they stopped Republicans from gutting the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Democrats also believe they were able to achieve higher spending levels overall than they would be able to get starting next year.\n\nWithin the White House, the retrenchment has been underway for days. Avoiding a shutdown, despite how much political damage the 2013 standoff did to Republicans, was a requirement. Protecting against cuts to Obamacare or immediate slashes in response to the president\u2019s immigration reform executive orders was enormous, and they worked themselves into thinking of anything else as sprinkles on top of the icing on the cake. Just the basics of having an omnibus bill instead of just a more temporary continuing resolution funding measure would be a major victory, in their telling.\n\nBut on the Hill, the discontent was palpable.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of stuff in there that\u2019ll give you heartburn,\u201d said Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.).\n\nHeading into the Senate Democrats\u2019 caucus meeting Tester caught the eye of Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.).\n\n\u201cHow\u2019s it going in there?\u201d he asked.\n\nGillibrand frowned. Tester laughed.\n\n\u201cLooks are worth a thousand words,\u201d he said, summing up the mood.\n\nEven though the White House struggled to bend Democrats\u2019 arms, some in the party argued that Obama couldn\u2019t have done much to change the dynamics of this or any other deal \u2014 even when Republicans control both chambers of Congress.\n\n\u201cThis is a compromise that Republicans and Democrats in the House decided on. I don\u2019t worry that it\u2019s going to get better or if it\u2019s going to get worse if the president\u2019s going to be involved more in negotiations,\u201d said Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.).\n\nBrown, who earlier in the day wrote a letter with Louisiana Republican Sen. David Vitter protesting the inclusion of the Dodd-Frank measures, said that the future of the financial regulations now rests with Obama and McConnell.\n\n\u201cNext year, the president\u2019s going to use his veto pen to stop the wholesale destruction of Dodd-Frank,\u201d Brown said.\n\nBrown said he could see some of the logic behind president\u2019s decision to allow the rollbacks in this funding bill.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he wanted to threaten because there\u2019s so much else. But next year: \u2018You weaken Dodd-Frank, I veto this bill, don\u2019t even bother sending it.\u2019 That\u2019s what I hope he does. I think that\u2019s what he does,\u201d Brown said.\n\nEven Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) said he accepted why the deal was struck and why the president and some Senate Democrats supported it. But he also took the unusual move of openly opposing the bill, well before it even came to the House for a vote.\n\n\u201cLook, nobody wants to shut down the government. Nobody sees it as a positive to go to a three-month CR. That\u2019s understandable. On the other hand, there are very onerous provisions which will hurt working people,\u201d he said.\n\nSanders, who may run as the most liberal presidential candidate of 2016, said he hoped that there would be less concessions in the future, though, which is going to take a big push from Obama \u2014 and a lot more coordination with Democrats in the future.\n\n\u201cWe have to work together. The White House plays a very, very important role: Make it clear the president will veto any effort to cut Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, nutrition,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cThe president has got to be a real strong leader on this.\u201d\n\nSeung Min Kim and Rachael Bade contributed to this report.\n\nFollow @politico", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "The president's base says he\u2019s sold them out.", "title": "Liberals: Obama abandoned us", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/12/liberals-obama-abandoned-us-113516.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/12/11/141211_elizabeth_warren2_gty_1160.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Barack Obama,Congress,Nancy Pelosi,Elizabeth Warren,Jose Serrano,Joe Biden,Sherrod Brown,Dodd-Frank", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "The president's base says he\u2019s sold them out.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd30ea\"", "article_summary": "Fighting the battle later was better than compromising now \u2014 the opposite argument that was coming from the White House.\nBrown said he could see some of the logic behind president\u2019s decision to allow the rollbacks in this funding bill.\nAfter meeting with McDonough, several Democrats said the White House had done nothing to change anyone\u2019s minds.\nThe result \u2014 a bill tilted heavily toward Republican priorities \u2014 was a compromise that the White House said Obama was eager to sign as soon as he could get it.\nWithin the White House, the retrenchment has been underway for days."}
