Tim Boyle/Bloomberg News\n\nGood morning. Independent board directors have long been a mark of respectability for U.S. companies and a benchmark for corporate governance that seeks to protect shareholders from C-suite excesses. But on closer scrutiny, the directors of some of America\u2019s largest corporations appear not to be as independent from the companies they run as initially seemed \u2013 potentially making them targets for activist investors. As The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Theo Francis and Joann S. Lublin report, some directors considered independent have close ties to the companies and executives they oversee, or to one another.\n\nSome investors say boards with longtime directors make them less inclined to challenge top executives. Ten-year board veterans hold 36% of board seats at S&P 500 companies, compared with 33% in 2005. Companies often argue that longtime board members contribute valuable insight and institutional memory in chaotic times, and that independence alone is no guarantee directors will do what is best for investors.\n\nWSJ takes a deep look inside America\u2019s boardrooms, with an interactive graphic showing how the biggest companies stack up in terms of board pay, independence and women directors.\n\nCFO JOURNAL TODAY\n\nAt the same time board composition is under scrutiny, a majority of directors agree with placing term and age limits on their tenures, but few firms actually subject executives to such limits, according to a forthcoming survey by EisnerAmper LLP. As CFO Journal\u2019s Maxwell Murphy reports, 75% believe in term and age limits for their board tenures, but most of the companies they work for don\u2019t have any in place. The survey of directors at some 300 companies found that 61% of directors reported that they were not subject to term limits and 76% said their directorships were not subject to age limits.\n\nTHE DAY AHEAD\n\nAt 7:00 a.m. the Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA) will publish results for the Mortgage Purchase Applications index.\n\nAt 8:30 a.m., Bureau of Labor Statistics releases the Consumer Price Index for December.
