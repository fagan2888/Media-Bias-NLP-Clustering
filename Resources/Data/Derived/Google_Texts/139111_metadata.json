So, in anticipation of a sector-wide hack someday, hospitals, insurers, HHS and other health-related organizations will rehearse real-time information sharing during a live, simulated attack.\n\n\"HealthCare.gov is one of the systems that connect these players to the government,\" HHS Chief Information Security Officer Kevin Charest said in an interview. That being the case, testers may exploit that connection during the exercise, he said.\n\nSeparately, security testers routinely try to penetrate HealthCare.gov to identify weaknesses, he added.\n\nCharest spoke on Monday amid allegations by House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Darrell Issa, R-Calif., and other Republicans that data is less secure in the online hub than officials have claimed.\n\nThis spring\u2019s simulated attack, scheduled for March, will not target a specific website, network or facility, but rather execute an assault that touches on all segments of the industry. The storyline is still in development.\n\nPeripherally, in the course of this exercise, HealthCare.gov might be drawn into the attack. \u201cWe want to get as many folks playing as we can,\u201d Charest said.\n\nComplicating security matters that arise from the interconnected networks, health care officials also must comply with medical privacy laws and be attuned to liability issues.\n\nIn an industry where information sharing can break the law, leaders are still trying to figure out how to communicate, HHS officials said.\n\n\"We may create a different way of speaking about incidents -- maybe we can find a way to genericize them such that they are non-attributable,\" Charest said. \"Let\u2019s get the information out, and let\u2019s let folks know what\u2019s happening, but do it in a way that protects the entity doing the sharing.\"\n\nThe results of the March exercise might prompt entities to change their business practices, not just technology operations.\n\n\"We don\u2019t necessarily need a lot about the context if we\u2019re looking at a particular campaign by some would-be attacker,\u201d Charest said. \u201cWhat we need to understand is the M.O.: How is this attacker going about doing what they are doing? And if we can do that in a way that takes the attribution -- Who might be being attacked and what\u2019s happening in their particular networks? -- out of the equation, I think we [enable] the sharing.\"\n\nGet the Nextgov iPhone app to keep up with government technology news.\n\n(Image via Olivier Le Queinec/Shutterstock.com)", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Aliya Sternstein", "description": "A simulated cyberattack will pit insurers, hospitals, HHS and others against a virtual intruder, officials say.", "og": {"site_name": "Nextgov", "description": "A simulated cyberattack will pit insurers, hospitals, HHS and others against a virtual intruder, officials say.", "title": "Network Security Drill Could Probe HealthCare.gov", "url": "http://www.nextgov.com/health/2014/01/network-security-drill-could-probe-healthcaregov/76745/", "image": "http://cdn.nextgov.com/media/img/upload/2014/01/13/011314securityNG.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://cdn.nextgov.com/media/img/upload/2014/01/13/011314securityNG/open-graph.jpg", "description": "A simulated cyberattack will pit insurers, hospitals, HHS and others against a virtual intruder, officials say.", "site": "@nextgov", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Network Security Drill Could Probe HealthCare.gov"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-01-13T21:24:17Z", "sailthru.images.full": "http://cdn.nextgov.com/media/img/upload/2014/01/13/011314securityNG.jpg", "sailthru.title": "Network Security Drill Could Probe HealthCare.gov", "keywords": "healthcare.gov data security, critical infrastructure, obamacare, hhs and obamacare, healthcare.gov", "fb": {"admins": 578600878}, "sailthru.images.thumb": "http://cdn.nextgov.com/media/img/upload/2014/01/13/011314securityNG/sailthru-thumbnail.jpg", "sailthru.tags": "healthcare.gov-data-security,critical-infrastructure,obamacare,hhs-and-obamacare,healthcare.gov,channel-nextgov->-health,type-story,length-medium,site-nextgov", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/Nextgov"}, "sailthru.description": "A simulated cyberattack will pit insurers, hospitals, HHS and others against a virtual intruder, officials say."}, "article_summary": "\"HealthCare.gov is one of the systems that connect these players to the government,\" HHS Chief Information Security Officer Kevin Charest said in an interview.\nPeripherally, in the course of this exercise, HealthCare.gov might be drawn into the attack.\nIntertwined systems that shuttle personal health information, such as the Obamacare website, can create headaches for entities trying to exchange threat intelligence while protecting privacy.\nSeparately, security testers routinely try to penetrate HealthCare.gov to identify weaknesses, he added.\nIn an industry where information sharing can break the law, leaders are still trying to figure out how to communicate, HHS officials said."}
