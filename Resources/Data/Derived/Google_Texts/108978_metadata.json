She wagged her finger at him and let loose a tirade.\n\nRep. Marino had dared to suggest that even though Democrats had a majority in 2009 and 2010, they did nothing to address immigration.\n\nPelosi countered that they had passed the \u201cDream Act.\u201d\n\nWell, thank you for that, Nancy. It\u2019s wonderful that you admit to creating the very cause of today\u2019s crisis on the border. Your display of indignance seems to have triggered a bout of unintended honesty.\n\nBut Nancy, have you forgotten the old saw, \u201cIf you can\u2019t stand the heat, get out of the kitchen?\u201d You should have noticed by now that there\u2019s a lot of heat in the political kitchen.\n\nWhile most Americans see open borders as a bad idea, the Democrats haven\u2019t gotten the message. They are trying to promote amnesty as a way to solve the job crisis, eliminate the deficit and enhance \u201cdiversity.\u201d\n\nFunny thing, though, the public just isn\u2019t buying it; most polls show people are dead set against it.\n\nBy the way, in her tirade, Ms. Pelosi referred to Rep. Marino as an \u201cinsignificant person.\u201d That\u2019s her opinion of the man who represents Pennsylvania\u2019s Tenth District. What do you suppose she thinks about us lesser Americans who only represent ourselves?\n\nPithanthropy the Human Conditioner by Jim Bozeman\n\nYou can order Pithanthropy, The Human Conditioner, in print and on Kindle from Amazon.com\n\nREAD MORE: Pithanthropy the Human Conditioner by Jim Bozeman here", "article_metadata": {"description": "\u201cRep.
