The company\u2019s most significant redesign since 1999 does away with the old font and its serifs (those little lines at the end of each character) and replaces them with the same custom typeface used in the logo for Google\u2019s new parent company, Alphabet.\n\nThe new look does more than just make the logo sleeker and more modern while echoing the newly created holding company. It also speaks to where Google is going \u2014 namely, its increasing presence on our mobile devices. Google\u2019s Vice President of Product Management Tamar Yehoshua and Director of User Experience Bobby Nath explained the transition on the company\u2019s blog:\n\n\u201cOnce upon a time, Google was one destination that you reached from one device: a desktop PC. These days, people interact with Google products across many different platforms, apps and devices\u2014sometimes all in a single day. You expect Google to help you whenever and wherever you need it, whether it\u2019s on your mobile phone, TV, watch, the dashboard in your car, and yes, even a desktop!\u201d\n\nRelated: 10 Biggest Tech Flops of the Century\u200b\u200b\n\nGoogle said in May that the number of searches on mobile devices had surpassed those on computers in 10 countries, including the U.S. and Japan. Its simplified new logo will load faster and read better \u201ceven on the tiniest screens.\u201d And when six letters are still too much to fit on one of those tiny screens, the company will present a four-color \u201cG\u201d icon that matches its new logo, or four animated dots that morph into other forms; the swirling new feature is meant to \u201crepresent Google\u2019s intelligence at work and indicate when Google is working for you,\u201d according to a post on Google\u2019s Design blog.\n\nIn other words, they\u2019re a tiny bit of swirling fun that will placate you as you wait for your information to load \u2014 and remind you that you\u2019re using a Google service and not some other company\u2019s product. Together, the new logo, the new \u201cG\u201d icon and the colored dots are Google\u2019s way to keep stamping its brand on our increasingly mobile world.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/09/01/Google-s-New-Logo-Sign-Where-Company-Headed", "type": "article", "site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "title": "Google\u2019s New Logo Is a Sign of Where the Company Is Headed"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/09/01/Google-s-New-Logo-Sign-Where-Company-Headed", "creator": "@yuvalrosenberg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd87bc\"", "article_summary": "The new look does more than just make the logo sleeker and more modern while echoing the newly created holding company.\nTogether, the new logo, the new \u201cG\u201d icon and the colored dots are Google\u2019s way to keep stamping its brand on our increasingly mobile world.\nGoogle is shaking things up again, rolling out a new logo that indicates where the company is going even as it keeps the colored letters that have become so familiar.\nThe company\u2019s most significant redesign since 1999 does away with the old font and its serifs (those little lines at the end of each character) and replaces them with the same custom typeface used in the logo for Google\u2019s new parent company, Alphabet.\nThese days, people interact with Google products across many different platforms, apps and devices\u2014sometimes all in a single day."}
