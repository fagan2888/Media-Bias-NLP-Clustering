I strongly support defunding Planned Parenthood. The organization is obsolete now that Obamacare covers services provided by Planned Parenthood. It is not fair to hardworking taxpayers for the government to keep spending their money on layers and layers of social services. Itâ€™s past time to live within our budget and to cut overlapping programs.
