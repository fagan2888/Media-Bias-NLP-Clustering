Fox News was putting on a brave face, though the sourness and anger were barely contained: but MSNBC, an avowedly liberal network, was in a state of almost convulsive ecstasy.\n\nAs dawn broke a woman, interviewed outside her run-down house somewhere upstate, shed tears while telling an interviewer what the victory meant for her. \u201cI now know,\u201d she sobbed, \u201cthat my house won\u2019t be foreclosed on.\u201d I hope she was right: but the evidence of the seven years since Obama the miracle-worker took office suggests she may have been disappointed.\n\nAmerica was angry after two terms of George W Bush. Though he could not stand, his party\u2019s candidate would be punished for how Mr Bush and the lunatics around him had made America an international pariah. The financial crisis of 2008 \u2013 the collapse of Lehmann Brothers came between the conventions and polling day \u2013 was the last straw.\n\nI had seen Obama at the primaries, and at the Democrat Convention. I had waited for him to speak intelligently and practically about the state of America and how he would put it right, but I waited in vain. The clich\u00e9 at the time, which became more relevant later, was about how he campaigned in poetry but would govern in prose. Some prose can be magnificent: but not his.\n\nHis stump oratory \u2013 especially his convention speech, delivered from a preposterous mock-Grecian stage set in Denver \u2013 was vacuous. He is clever and has a way with words: but his words contained little. He entranced audiences, first in his own party \u2013 which is why he beat Hillary Clinton, arrogant and boring then as now, for the nomination \u2013 and then in the wider electorate. John McCain \u2013 old, white, Republican and with the media\u2019s hate figure, Sarah Palin, as his running mate \u2013 didn\u2019t have a prayer.\n\nAs Lehmann\u2019s sank, political leaders, including potential presidents, met to discuss what to do. Mr Obama said nothing: and the liberal media praised him for his silence, suggesting it showed his wisdom by reserving judgment on so complex a matter. Perhaps it did. Or perhaps it showed he didn\u2019t have a clue. America\u2019s slow, stumbling path to recovery, and its awesome level of debt \u2013 just under $19 trillion, or 104 per cent of GDP \u2013 suggest the latter. The great stimulus the Democrats then engineered disappeared and achieved nothing.\n\nThe sobbing woman in upstate New York was white and middle-aged. To glimpse how little Mr Obama has done for his own constituency \u2013 the poor blacks \u2013 it is worth reading an instructive article in the latest New Yorker. It is about evictions in Milwaukee, a city that is 40 per cent black. An industry exists to service evictions \u2013 courts, lawyers, removal men, bailiffs \u2013 and operates full-time, dealing with masses who cannot pay their rent, or their mortgages.\n\nRacial tensions, which a black president was supposed to heal, seem worse than ever \u2013 remember Ferguson \u2013 and Mr Obama\u2019s interventions have often been clumsy and grandstanding\n\nMr Obama was elected promising to end such misery: but he hasn\u2019t, and he never would. America has astonishing wealth: it also has astonishing deprivation and squalor, because there isn\u2019t enough well-paid work to go round. I don\u2019t know Milwaukee, but am familiar with cities such as Baltimore, Newark and Trenton on the east coast, which have square miles of squalor on a scale unknown in Britain. Detroit teeters on the verge of extinction: in thriving cities such as Los Angeles and Washington DC pockets of affluence sit cheek-by-jowl with areas of appalling poverty and crime.\n\nRacial tensions, which a black president was supposed to heal, seem worse than ever \u2013 remember Ferguson \u2013 and Mr Obama\u2019s interventions have often been clumsy and grandstanding. He has failed to control immigration, even though (unlike in Britain) he has the sovereign power to do so. And America has largely rejected Obamacare, which displays all that can go wrong with massive state intervention.\n\nBut if Mr Obama\u2019s economic legacy is poor, his other achievements \u2013 or failings \u2013 are alarming. He has largely removed America from international conversations. After the disastrous interventions in the Islamic world after 2001 it is quite right it should think more deeply about such expeditions: but that does not mean the superpower\u2019s global responsibility can be abdicated completely. The Kerry intervention in Syria last week was typically, and tragically, late. Mr Obama\u2019s international legacy is the repulsive sight of Vladimir Putin, whom he underestimated, ruling the roost, the barbarians of Isil (for dealing with whom he had no strategy) and a Europe mired in introspection.\n\nIt was interesting, after Donald Trump triumphed in New Hampshire last week, how many of his voters complained of feeling that America was being kicked around in the world. A great nation that is being forced to confront its global impotence is one for whom the bombastic Mr Trump holds inevitable appeal; and an America with such deep-seated social and economic problems is one that will look to Bernie Sanders. After all, everything else has been tried, so why not what he calls \u201cdemocratic socialism\u201d?\n\nSince George H.W. Bush left office in 1993 America has been ruled by a spin-obsessed sex addict, a dangerous halfwit and a clever incompetent\n\nBarack Obama created neither the poverty, nor the suspicion and loathing with which America was regarded in the world after George W Bush. However, he promised to cure the first, and has been found wanting; and he has used the second as an excuse to do nothing except withdraw. His role as President is now little more than as a spokesman for the bleeding heart and the bleeding obvious. When he is gone no one will miss him, least of all the one-time allies who feel he has spurned them. He has made America much less relevant.\n\nSince George H.W. Bush left office in 1993 America has been ruled by a spin-obsessed sex addict, a dangerous halfwit and a clever incompetent. They all bore the imprimatur of their respective party machines. For much of America, Barack Obama is the last straw. He is the creator of Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders. If one of them becomes president \u2013 and I wouldn\u2019t rule it out \u2013 and the world doesn\u2019t like it, they know whom to blame.\n\nRead more of Simon Heffer's column", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "DCSext.articleId": 12154670, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03520/84093984_In_this_D_3520696k.jpg"}, "site": "@Telegraph", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "barack obama, george w bush, bill clinton, Donald Trump,World News,News", "DCSext.cmsSect": "Comment;Simon_Heffer;Personal_View;US_Politics;Donald_Trump", "DCSext.Channel": "news", "DCSext.MLC": "/news/worldnews/donald-trump", "DCSext.Content_Type": "Story", "news_keywords": "barack obama, george w bush, bill clinton", "WT.cg_n": "news", "title": "How seven years of Obama created Trump", "section-id": 9408, "GSACategory": "donaldtrump", "tmgads.pagetype": "Story", "DCSext.akamigeo": "US", "tmgads.section": "news-worldnews-donald_trump", "GSAMLC": "worldnews/donaldtrump", "GSAArticleType": "Story", "DCSext.pd": 1, "WT.cg_s": "worldnews", "description": "America has been run for nearly a decade by a clever incompetent.
