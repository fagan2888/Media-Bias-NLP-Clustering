House members are also set to take up several other major bills that day, including Senate Bill 575, a measure banning health insurance plans sold on the Affordable Care Act's marketplace from covering abortions \u2014 setting the scene for opponents to use parliamentary maneuvers and other tactics to delay a vote.\n\nState Rep. Larry Phillips, the Sherman Republican who chairs the House Homeland Security Committee, told The Texas Tribune last week that bringing the Senate version of campus carry to the House floor allows members \"to have a full debate and discuss it so that something of that magnitude does not become law without being debated here.\"\n\nProponents of the measure argue that not allowing concealed handgun license holders to carry their firearms on campus infringes on the rights of law-abiding citizens \u2014 and, at worst, could leave them without a means to defend themselves during an attack.\n\nBut the proposal has been criticized by some high-ranking university officials, including University of Texas System Chancellor William McRaven, who wrote a letter to lawmakers in January expressing his concern that allowing guns on college campuses \u201cwill lead to an increase in both accidental shootings and self-inflicted wounds.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re in a heated debate with somebody in the middle of a classroom, and you don\u2019t know whether or not that individual is carrying, how does that inhibit the interaction between students and faculty?\u201d McRaven asked at a Texas Tribune event in February.\n\nMcRaven and others have suggested gun-wielding students might intimidate classmates and professors to the point of curbing freedom of speech.\n\nIn advance of Tuesday's debate, the office of state Rep. Chris Turner, D-Fort Worth, released correspondence the lawmaker had sent McRaven asking whether the addition of certain provisions to campus carry legislation might improve it.\n\nMcRaven responded with several suggestions, including banning handguns at research laboratories that pose biosafety hazards, university premises that are connected to a hospital, and crisis counseling centers and other areas where people are in \"high stress or emotionally charged circumstances.\"\n\nTurner also asked whether McRaven feared a campus carry policy would hurt the university's competitiveness in hiring top quality professors.\n\nGiven that studies of college faculty reveal that the majority oppose campus carry, McRaven said, \"it is reasonable to conclude\" that candidates for jobs at the University of Texas might instead accept offers from universities in states that don't allow it.\n\nGov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, has said he will sign both open and campus carry measures if they clear the Legislature.\n\nReporter Juli\u00e1n Aguilar contributed to this story.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Supporters of campus carry will be fighting against the clock on Tuesday when the Texas House takes up previously delayed legislation requiring public universities and colleges to allow concealed handguns on their campuses.", "parsely-title": "House to Take Up Campus Carry Ahead of Deadline", "twitter": {"description": "Supporters of campus carry will be fighting against the clock on Tuesday when the Texas House takes up previously delayed legislation requiring public universities and colleges to allow concealed h...", "title": "House to Take Up Campus Carry Ahead of Deadline", "url": "https://www.texastribune.org/2015/05/26/texas-house-takes-campus-carry-ahead-key-deadline/", "image": "https://static.texastribune.org/media/images/CampusCarry2_jpg_407x1000_q100.jpg", "creator": "@MorganSmith", "site": "@TexasTribune", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 154122474650943, "pages": 124434790836}, "og": {"site_name": "The Texas Tribune", "description": "Supporters of campus carry will be fighting against the clock on Tuesday when the Texas House takes up previously delayed legislation requiring public universities and colleges to allow concealed handguns on their campuses.", "title": "House to Take Up Campus Carry Ahead of Deadline", "url": "https://www.texastribune.org/2015/05/26/texas-house-takes-campus-carry-ahead-key-deadline/", "image": "https://static.texastribune.org/media/images/CampusCarry2_jpg_800x1000_q100.jpg", "type": "article"}, "parsely-tags": "Guns In Texas,Higher Education,The 84th Legislature", "parsely-author": "Morgan Smith", "parsely-section": "front-page", "parsely-type": "post", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/texastribune/"}, "parsely-pub-date": "May 26, 2015, 6 a.m.", "parsely-image-url": "https://static.texastribune.org/media/images/CampusCarry2_jpg_407x1000_q100.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "parsely-link": "http://www.texastribune.org/2015/05/26/texas-house-takes-campus-carry-ahead-key-deadline/"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1864\"", "article_summary": "Greg Abbott, a Republican, has said he will sign both open and campus carry measures if they clear the Legislature.\nTurner also asked whether McRaven feared a campus carry policy would hurt the university's competitiveness in hiring top quality professors.\nSupporters of campus carry will be fighting against the clock on Tuesday when the Texas House takes up previously delayed legislation requiring public universities and colleges to allow concealed handguns on their campuses.\nAfter a month of discussion over whether to attach campus carry to another piece of gun legislation \u2014 an effort to squeeze the controversial measure through \u2014 House lawmakers opted to consider the bill, Senate Bill 11, on its own.\nIn advance of Tuesday's debate, the office of state Rep.
