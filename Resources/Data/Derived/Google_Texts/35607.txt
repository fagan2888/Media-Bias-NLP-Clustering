The next time you eat at Abrusci’s Italian Restaurant in Wheat Ridge, don’t bother tipping your server.

The restaurant at 3244 Youngfield St. announced Tuesday that it will institute a no-tipping policy starting July 20.

Instead of tipping, diners will be required to pay a 20 percent service charge on their checks that will go directly to restaurant payroll and benefits, according to a news release. Customers will still be able to evaluate their experience via a confidential survey provided with each check.

Under the change, all servers, whether salaried or hourly, will be paid a minimum of $20/hour, according to the release. The average kitchen wage will go up to $14.50/hour, from $11/hour. Most servers will be moved to a 34-hour salaried work week and will receive two weeks of paid sick leave/vacation and discretionary annual bonuses. Restaurant owners are also exploring health-care options for full-time employees.

“All of our employees are like family and they deserve to be treated like family,” restaurant owner Nancy Progar said in a statement. “Everyone who works in our restaurant deserves a living wage. Happier employees mean better food and service which results in happier customers. While this approach to compensation will be slightly more expensive for us, we feel that it will allow us to be more successful in the future. In addition, we believe that a customer’s written review will be a much better vehicle for feedback and improvement than an arbitrary tip.”

Abrusci’s follows in the footsteps of some very well known restaurants across the U.S. Among those that have replaced tipping with surcharges or all-inclusive prices are Alinea in Chicago, Chez Panisse in Berkeley, French Laundry in Napa Valley and Per Se in New York.
