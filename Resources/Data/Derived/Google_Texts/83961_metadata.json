In behavioral tests, the mice whose genes had been learned faster, remembered events longer and solved complex exercises better than mice without the alteration.\n\nThe PDE4B-inhibited mice also spent more time in open spaces, brightly lit spaces and displayed lower levels of fear in the presence of cat urine, as opposed to regular mice who displayed normal levels of fear at the potential of cat nearby.\n\nResearchers said they are now working on drugs to inhibit the enzyme, which will be tested with animals to further observe their potential use in humans.\n\n\"In the future, medicines targeting PDE4B may potentially improve the lives of individuals with neurocognitive disorders and life-impairing anxiety, and they may have a time-limited role after traumatic events,\" said Dr. Alexander McGirr, a psychiatrist-in-training at the University of British Columbia.\n\nThe study is published in Neuropsychopharmacology.", "article_metadata": {"description": "By changing a gene in mice, researchers were able make them more intelligent and less susceptible to fear and anxiety, according to a new study.", "og": {"site_name": "UPI", "description": "By changing a gene in mice, researchers were able make them more intelligent and less susceptible to fear and anxiety, according to a new study.", "title": "'Brainy mice' may lead to better cognitive disorder treatments", "url": "http://www.upi.com/Health_News/2015/08/14/Brainy-mice-may-lead-to-better-cognitive-disorder-treatments/9721439561793/", "image": "http://cdnph.upi.com/sv/ph/og/i/9721439561793/2015/1/14395660558868/v2.1/Brainy-mice-may-lead-to-better-cognitive-disorder-treatments.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@UPI", "image": "http://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/9721439561793/2015/i/14395660558868/v2.1/Brainy-mice-may-lead-to-better-cognitive-disorder-treatments.jpg?lg=4", "description": "By changing a gene in mice, researchers were able make them more intelligent and less susceptible to fear and anxiety, according to a new study.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "'Brainy mice' may lead to better cognitive disorder treatments"}, "fb": {"app_id": 130795020312660}, "keywords": "Health, Alzheimer's Disease", "google-site-verification": "vnkcuJA1Q89cLmy4OZpuQKOf5Jf6ny_RVh7BpxZ11a0", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Health, Alzheimer's Disease"}, "article_summary": "Researchers believe their work to inhibit the enzyme phosphodiesterase-4B, or PDE4B, in mice could lead to new treatments for disorders that include cognitive declines, such as Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia and post-traumatic stress disorder.\nThe researchers altered genes in mice to inhibit PDE4B is present in many organs of vertebrates, including humans.\nLEEDS, England, Aug. 14 (UPI) -- By changing a gene in mice, researchers were able make them more intelligent and less susceptible to fear and anxiety, according to a new study.\nIn behavioral tests, the mice whose genes had been learned faster, remembered events longer and solved complex exercises better than mice without the alteration.\n\"Cognitive impairments are currently poorly treated, so I'm excited that our work using mice has identified phosphodiesterase-4B as a promising target for potential new treatments,\" said Dr. Steve Clapcote, a lecturer in pharmacology at the University of Leeds, in a press release."}
