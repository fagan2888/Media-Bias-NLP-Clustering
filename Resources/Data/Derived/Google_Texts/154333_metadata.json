(Photo: Ralph Binder, courtesy Monmouth University )\n\nForty-eight years ago this Monday, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. touched down at a small airport outside Red Bank on a chartered flight from New York and made the 15-minute trek by car to what was then-Monmouth College in West Long Branch.\n\nKing, 37, who would be martyred in Memphis, Tennessee, just 18 months later, had accepted an invitation to address the school as part of its student union lecture series.\n\nLongtime Asbury Park Press columnist Bill Handleman, who died in 2010, reflected on the famous civil rights leader\u2019s visit in 2007. Handleman recalled then that Monmouth College was then a small liberal arts school, not particularly known for being all that liberal.\n\n\u201cIn the autumn of 1966, Monmouth County was a safe place, out of range,\u201d Handleman wrote. \u201c(Seemingly) stuck in the happy days of the Eisenhower administration\u201d a decade earlier.\n\nBoylan Gymnasium, which at the time was called Alumni Memorial Gymnasium, was packed that morning with what Handleman described as \u201ca sea of white faces.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow, it\u2019s a fact that we\u2019ve come a long, long way but it doesn\u2019t hold truth,\u201d King sermonized. \u201cAnd I\u2019m afraid if I stop at this point, I will leave you the victims of a dangerous optimism. If I stop here, I will send us away the victims of an illusion wrapped in superficiality. So, in order to tell the truth, it is necessary to move on and not only talk about the fact that we\u2019ve come a long, long way but to make it powerfully clear that we still have a long, long way to go before the ideal of integration is a reality.\u201d\n\nIn 1966, the violence and murder against blacks and white civil rights workers was still a \u201cpopular pastime\u201d in some parts of the country, he said. A year earlier, more than 40 people were killed in Alabama and Mississippi and not a single one had been convicted.\n\n\u201cIn the last 18 months, some 57 churches, Negro churches, have been burned to the ground in the state of Mississippi,\u201d King said. \u201cNothing has been done about it. It seems that they have a new motto in Mississippi, not attend the church of your choice, but burn the church of your choice.\u201d\n\nThere was progress, King said. At that moment in Grenada, Mississippi, the civil rights leader explained, his organization was working to complete the desegregation of previously all-white schools. However, it was not a job for the timid.\n\n\u201cAnd on the first day of going to the previously all white school, what do they confront? They find grown men beating little children with chains, with clubs, with sticks. All of this reminds us that we still have a long, long way to go.\u201d\n\nThe Asbury Park Press covered King\u2019s speech on Oct. 6, 1966. The newspaper reported in its evening edition that there were about 2,600 students and faculty members in attendance.\n\nWhile King had received an enthusiastic reception, the article observed that some students later stormed out of the gymnasium and others, including a sitting Monmouth County freeholder and college trustee who was seated in the third row, began heckling King when his remarks turned to his opposition of the Vietnam War.\n\n\u201cIt seems to me that if a nation can spend that much money on a war in Vietnam and it can spend $20 billion to put a man on the moon, it can spend billions of dollars to place God\u2019s children on their own two feet here on earth,\u201d King said. \u201cThe challenge is the question of whether we have the will. It seems, at times, that we are more concerned about the size of the national gross product rather than about how many people benefit from it. It seems at times that we are more concerned about winning the war in Vietnam than we are about winning the war against poverty here at home.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: http://on.app.com/1vDDugD", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "On Oct. 6, 1966, the Rev.
