For freshmen and sophomores, tuition will be discounted. The programs typically cost about $10,000 per year.\n\nThere are a lot of questions that we won't know the answer to for awhile, such as, how many people are really equipped to work and get a degree at the same time. And how useful will the program actually be? Perhaps only a small number of students will actually get something out of it.\n\nBut this is a brilliant experiment from Starbucks.\n\nStarbucks has always been ahead of the curve, when it comes to retail, when it comes to benefits. The fact that Starbucks made healthcare available has always been one reason why people sought out Starbucks jobs. Except now, in the age of Obamacare, with healthcare more readily available to individuals, that isn't as much of a draw.\n\nNot only is it less of a draw, it's less of a hook to keep current employees employed. Turnover is constantly going to be an issue for retailers. This should help. Employees who are working towards a degree will be less inclined to leave if it means losing subsidized access.\n\nThe benefit should also help Starbucks maintain a high quality of applicant. It sounds perverse in an era where unemployment is still high, but companies constantly complain about having a hard time finding reliable people. An applicant interested in getting a degree is probably the kind of employee you want, even if they're just there for a couple years.\n\nAgain, it's easy to imagine this being of limited benefit to a small number of employees. Online education is still relatively unproven. Maybe the degree won't go very far. But from Starbucks' perspective \u2014 which desires to reduce turnover and attract a high quality applicant \u2014 there are some good reasons to introduce this benefit.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#185f7c", "sailthru.author": "Joe Weisenthal", "application-name": "Business Insider", "twitter": {"description": "This should help Starbucks get the very best applicants.", "title": "Starbucks Has A Brilliant Plan To Give Free College To Thousands Of Employees", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/starbucks-free-college-plan-2014-6", "image": "http://static4.businessinsider.com/image/539ed28f69bedd7d6c572bcc-506-253/starbucks-has-a-brilliant-plan-to-give-free-college-to-thousands-of-employees.jpg", "creator": "thestalwart", "site": "bi_university", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.verticals": "education,clusterstock,careers,retail,moneygame", "linkedin": {"owner": "mid:1d5f7b"}, "sailthru.tags": "Starbucks, Joe Weisenthal,", "news_keywords": "Starbucks, Joe Weisenthal,", "author": "Joe Weisenthal", "sailthru.date": "2014-06-16", "sailthru.title": "Starbucks Has A Brilliant Plan To Give Free College To Thousands Of Employees", "theme-color": "#185f7c", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://static3.businessinsider.com/image/5255940e69bedd0d32e7e54a-50-50/starbucks-has-a-brilliant-plan-to-give-free-college-to-thousands-of-employees.jpg", "description": "This should help Starbucks get the very best applicants.", "tbi-image": "http://static6.businessinsider.com/image/5255940e69bedd0d32e7e54a/starbucks-has-a-brilliant-plan-to-give-free-college-to-thousands-of-employees.jpg", "fb": {"app_id": 155043519637}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://static1.businessinsider.com/assets/images/us/favicons/mstile-144x144.png?v=BI-US-2016-03-31", "date": "2014-06-16", "article": {"publisher": "businessinsider", "author": "http://www.businessinsider.com/author/joe-weisenthal"}, "sailthru.description": "This should help Starbucks get the very best applicants.", "viewport": "width=1024", "og": {"site_name": "Business Insider", "description": "This should help Starbucks get the very best applicants.", "title": "Starbucks Has A Brilliant Plan To Give Free College To Thousands Of Employees", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/starbucks-free-college-plan-2014-6", "image": "http://static1.businessinsider.com/image/539ed28f69bedd7d6c572bcc-1190-625/starbucks-has-a-brilliant-plan-to-give-free-college-to-thousands-of-employees.jpg", "type": "article"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Business Insider", "title": "Starbucks Has A Brilliant Plan To Give Free College To Thousands Of Employees", "sailthru.image.full": "http://static6.businessinsider.com/image/5255940e69bedd0d32e7e54a/starbucks-has-a-brilliant-plan-to-give-free-college-to-thousands-of-employees.jpg", "tbi-vertical": "education"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7fee\"", "article_summary": "Starbucks will give free college tuition to thousands of employees.\nThe coffee chain is partnering with Arizona State University to allow Starbucks employees to get degrees through the university's highly-acclaimed online degree program.\nThe fact that Starbucks made healthcare available has always been one reason why people sought out Starbucks jobs.\nMaybe the degree won't go very far.\nBut from Starbucks' perspective \u2014 which desires to reduce turnover and attract a high quality applicant \u2014 there are some good reasons to introduce this benefit."}
