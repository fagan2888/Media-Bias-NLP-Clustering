A third vehicle was also struck, injuring the driver.\n\nHobbs ran away after the crash but was caught by police that night. Six passengers who had been in the stolen Tahoe with him also were arrested.\n\nRothstein dismissed the defense argument of youth and said no matter how old a person is, stealing a car and driving at that speed is against the law.\n\n\u201cAll of these things are pretty common sense,\u201d Rothstein said.\n\nThe 30-year sentence included the maximum 15 years for a felony charge of hit-and-run causing death and an additional 15 years for two counts of second-degree homicide. During the first 10 years, Rothstein ordered Hobbs to spend at least 20 hours annually talking to high school students about his experience in an effort to decrease reckless teen driving. After he is released from prison, Hobbs must serve 20 years of extended supervision.\n\nHobbs did not have a driver\u2019s license. He admitted being high on marijuana at the time of the crash.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about a person who shouldn\u2019t have been on the road,\u201d Assistant District Attorney Antoni Apollo said.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, http://www.jsonline.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "An 18-year-old has been sentenced to 30 years in prison for a February hit-and-run crash that killed a Milwaukee couple a block from their home.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "An 18-year-old has been sentenced to 30 years in prison for a February hit-and-run crash that killed a Milwaukee couple a block from their home.", "title": "18-year-old gets 30 years for Milwaukee crash that killed 2", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jul/19/man-18-gets-30-years-in-crash-that-killed-milwauke/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/07/19/a611422a3441ad207c0f6a706700ce37.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/07/19/a611422a3441ad207c0f6a706700ce37.jpg", "description": "An 18-year-old has been sentenced to 30 years in prison for a February hit-and-run crash that killed a Milwaukee couple a block from their home.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "18-year-old gets 30 years for Milwaukee crash that killed 2"}, "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9032\"", "article_summary": "MILWAUKEE (AP) - An 18-year-old has been sentenced to 30 years in prison for a February hit-and-run crash that killed a Milwaukee couple a block from their home.\nHobbs ran away after the crash but was caught by police that night.\nAfter he is released from prison, Hobbs must serve 20 years of extended supervision.\nMilwaukee County Circuit Court Judge Stephanie Rothstein agreed but said the best place for Hobbs to learn those lessons is behind bars, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel (http://bit.ly/1Lxces1 ) reported.\nDefense attorneys argued that as Michael Hobbs matures, he will better understand the consequences of stealing a Chevrolet Tahoe and causing the crash."}
