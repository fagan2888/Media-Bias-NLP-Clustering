Talk to Flores for five minutes, and you\u2019ll feel a special allegiance to the Lone Star state.\n\nFlores touts himself as a congressman who can get along with anyone \u2014 a skill that\u2019s essential to lead.\n\nThat\u2019s why he threw his hat into the ring to chair the Republican Study Committee, a group of House Republicans responsible for advancing a conservative social and economic agenda.\n\nAlthough familiar to relatively few Americans, the RSC is one of the nation\u2019s most influential groups of conservatives. Holding the chairmanship can be substantial to a congressman\u2019s career.\n\nRecent RSC chairmen include Jeb Hensarling of Texas, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, and Jim Jordan of Ohio, chairman of the Oversight Subcommittee on Economic Growth.\n\n>>> 3 Lawmakers Offer Their Political Smarts to Head RSC\n\nThis year offers three contenders for the chairman\u2019s seat: Flores, Mick Mulvaney of South Carolina and another Texan, Louie Gohmert.\n\nFlores, 60, says one stark difference between him and his competitors is that he\u2019s not one to make enemies out of allies.\n\n\u201cIf you look at my history in Congress in the last four years, you won\u2019t see that I\u2019ve done anything to embarrass the team or to burn bridges in the conference,\u201d Flores says in an interview with The Daily Signal. \u201cYou won\u2019t find any volatile quotes out in the press where I\u2019ve run the team down publicly.\u201d\n\nInstead, Flores says he maintains a collaborative, member-driven leadership style.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have all the answers, so my goal is to make sure that the 180-some odd members of the RSC each have a seat at the table where we can talk about their vision.\u201d\n\n>>> Roots and Ribs: Louie Gohmert Wants to Head Conservative Caucus\n\n>>> Mick Mulvaney Relishes Opportunity to Move This Group to the Right\n\nBut that\u2019s not to say Flores is afraid to ruffle some feathers.\n\nA ninth-generation Texan, Flores grew up Baptist in Stratford, a small town in the Texas Panhandle. He delivered papers at the age of 10; by 13, he spent six days a week during the summer driving a tractor, building fences and working cattle.\n\nHe paid his own way through Texas A&M University, graduating in 1976 with a degree in accounting. In 1985, he received a master\u2019s degree in business administration from Houston Baptist University.\n\nThis humble-yet-determined upbringing formed the foundation for Flores\u2019 conservative views and values.\n\nThe Strategy\n\nWhen Bill Flores finds himself in disagreement with leadership, his strategy is to walk into the appropriate office and confront the situation head-on.\n\n\u201cBut that stays inside that room,\u201d he stresses.\n\nIssues that Flores hopes to spearhead as chairman of the RSC include job creation and economic growth, restoration of a strong national defense, promotion of traditional social values and balancing the federal budget.\n\nFlores already is a member of the House Budget Committee. He also hopes to leverage his experience as president and CEO of Phoenix Exploration, an oil and gas company, to spearhead a new conservative strategy to make America an energy superpower.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d love to see an energy strategy for the first time in a long time, something like the Jindal-Flores plan that we just published six weeks ago.\u201d\n\nThese issues all come second to repealing and replacing Obamacare, a move that Mulvaney, Gohmert and Flores say they agree upon.\n\nBesides saying he is a \u201cbetter consensus leader\u201d than his two competitors, Flores touts his record on national defense as a pillar for mustering support away from Mulvaney, who some GOP insiders figure is leading the race.\n\nOf the 38 national defense bills considered important to the RSC, \u201cI\u2019ve got a 100 percent voting record,\u201d Flores says. \u201cLouie\u2019s [score] is 67 percent and Mulvaney\u2019s is 13 percent \u2014 and these are the votes that the RSC members think are important.\u201d\n\nIn a conference that places a high value on national security, the talking point carries a lot of weight.\n\n>>> Lame-Duck Congress Must Renew Commitment to Missile Defense\n\nAnother potential breaking point?\n\nMulvaney told The New York Times that he is open to granting legal status to some of the estimated 11 million immigrants living in the U.S. illegally \u2014 a major bone of contention between the party\u2019s \u201cestablishment\u201d and conservative wings.\n\nFlores and Gohmert say they oppose any form of amnesty or \u201creward\u201d for those in the country illegally.\n\nThe Way Forward\n\nWhether Flores wins or loses in his bid for RSC chairman, one thing looks certain: The congressman will continue serving the Lone Star State with an optimistic smile, helping to anchor the RSC\u2019s clout with Republican majorities in the House and Senate.\n\n\u201cIn the 114th Congress, [the RSC] is going to be the biggest, most influential caucus in Congress,\u201d Flores says. \u201c[It has] the ability to have the greatest impact for the good of the American people that we\u2019ve see in a long time.\u201d\n\nGiven the new political landscape, Flores says, conservatives \u201cneed to make sure that we take advantage of its size, its character and the passion of its members.\u201d\n\nWhy?\n\n\u201cTo make sure that we can take the headwinds that are coming out of Washington in the face of our American businesses and families and turn those headwinds into tailwinds.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Bill Flores touts himself as a congressman who can get along with anyone \u2014 a skill that\u2019s essential to lead House conservatives.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Bill Flores touts himself as a congressman who can get along with anyone \u2014 a skill that\u2019s essential to lead House conservatives.", "title": "This Texan Hopes to Be Conservatives' 'Consensus Leader'", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/flores.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-11-18T12:57:40+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1xpjn89"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Bill Flores touts himself as a congressman who can get along with anyone \u2014 a skill that\u2019s essential to lead House conservatives.", "title": "This Texan Hopes to Be Conservatives' 'Consensus Leader'", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/flores.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "lame duck,politics", "published_time": "2014-11-17T03:01:52+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-18T12:57:40+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Republican Study Committee, Bill Flores, Louie Gohmert, Mick Mulvaney, RSC, rsc race"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2277\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIn the 114th Congress, [the RSC] is going to be the biggest, most influential caucus in Congress,\u201d Flores says.\nThis humble-yet-determined upbringing formed the foundation for Flores\u2019 conservative views and values.\nAlthough familiar to relatively few Americans, the RSC is one of the nation\u2019s most influential groups of conservatives.\n>>> 3 Lawmakers Offer Their Political Smarts to Head RSCThis year offers three contenders for the chairman\u2019s seat: Flores, Mick Mulvaney of South Carolina and another Texan, Louie Gohmert.\nRecent RSC chairmen include Jeb Hensarling of Texas, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, and Jim Jordan of Ohio, chairman of the Oversight Subcommittee on Economic Growth."}
