Play dates at the park didn\u2019t necessarily mean a parent had to accompany a child. Now times have changed. If you allow your child to play alone outside, it could land you in jail. That\u2019s exactly what happened to one Florida mom.\n\nNicole Gainey of Port St. Lucie was locked up for child neglect after letting her son Dominic walk to a playground about 15 minutes away from their home.\n\nAccording to the NY Daily News, the seven-year-old was passing a public pool when someone asked him where his mom was.\n\n\u201cThey asked me a couple questions and I got scared so I ran off to the park and they called the cops,\u201d the boy told WPTV-TV.\n\nPolice found the boy at the park a little while later and asked him where he lived. They took him home and later arrested his mom.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t the first time Dominic was allowed to walk to the park by himself. Gainey said that he did have a cell phone in case she needed to contact him.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m totally dumbfounded by this whole situation,\u201d Gainey told the station.\n\n\u201cHonestly didn\u2019t think I was doing anything wrong. I was letting him go play,\u201d she said.\n\nCops informed her that with registered sex offenders in the area, allowing her son to play at the park was not safe.\n\nSome parents may see nothing wrong with what Gainey did. In fact, they may praise her for not being an overprotective parent. A recent study by PLOS One revealed that there is link between overprotective moms and childhood obesity. Gainey may be viewed as a great parent for allowing her son independence. But, others may not be so quick to wave the \u201cmom of the year\u201d flag.\n\nThe reality is that we live in a different world. When I was 7, I was allowed to ride my bike alone. I would also walk to the park alone. My Mom would tell me \u201cjust make sure you\u2019re home before it gets dark.\u201d Nowadays, you have to think twice before letting your kids roam free. Playgrounds are a breeding ground for pedophiles.\n\nPeriodically I check the registered sex offender list in my area. It turns out we have a few in our neighborhood. In fact, one lives right around the corner from us. We pass by his street every weekend when we take the kids out for a walk. My children are only 4 and 1. They\u2019re way too young to play outside by themselves. But, I can tell you they won\u2019t be allowed to go anywhere by themselves at age 7.\n\nPhotos: Morgue File\n\nStacy-Ann Gooden (aka Weather Anchor Mama) can be seen delivering the weather on the news weeknights in New York City.
