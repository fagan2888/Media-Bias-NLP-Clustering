HIGH POINT, N.C. -- Hey, I am Alix! Welcome to our new segment, Ask Alix. If you have a question for me about ways technology can make life a little easier, send it to AskAlix@wghp.com.

Today we're talking taxes.

While not the most exciting topic, there are some great apps out there to help you get your taxes done quickly.

The two best apps for filing taxes are the Turbo Tax app and the H&R Block app.

Turbo Tax's app is free so you just pay when you print or file. The app will ask you a series of questions and then you snap a photo of your W-2 form.

The app searches about 350 tax deductions and credits to make sure you get the maximum refund.

Most reviewers love this app because it's quick and easy to use.

H&R Block's app is also free. Anyone can file federal returns through the app for free, but it costs $9.99 to prepare a state return.

This app works best for simple returns so it's best for people filing a 1040EZ. All you have to do is take a picture of your W-2 form and it will automatically fill out the form.

For any apps like these it's important to remember to create a strong password and check the app frequently to ensure none of your information is compromised.

Donation Assistant by TaxAct and TaxAct DocVault are great apps for tracking charitable donations and managing documents for filing next year.

This year the IRS is also tweeting out some helpful tips for filing this year. If you signed up for health insurance through the Marketplace some of these tips are great for filing this year.
