Heavily-shorted stocks usually pop when the broader market rises. Not this time.

The 50 stocks in the S&P 500 with the highest short interest are up an average of 1% since the stock market scraped an intraday low on Aug 24, according to Bespoke Investment Group. That’s well below the average gain of the remaining 450 stocks, which stands at 8%.

Bespoke said that bucks the trend that usually plays out when markets rise–and it’s not the only way the recent run-up has been unusual.

Bespoke noted that in rallies like the current one, investors usually see smaller stocks outperform larger stocks, growth names outpace value stocks and beaten-up shares bounce the most. That’s not what’s happening this time, though.

The smallest stocks in the S&P 500 aren’t up nearly as much as their large-cap peers, continuing a trend that’s been playing out for much of the year. Bespoke’s data show that the 50 biggest stocks in the S&P are up an average of 11% since Aug. 24, versus an average increase of 3.9% for the 50 smallest stocks.

Additionally, stocks with the highest and lowest price-to-earnings multiples are both leading since Aug. 24. Bespoke said it’s usually the case that highly-valued names outperform low-valued firms during rallies like these.

While beaten-down shares usually bounce the most coming out of a correction, that too hasn’t been the case over the last three months. Bespoke data show that the worst performers leading into the market selloff remain the laggards as the market recovers.

The S&P 500 is off fractionally the past two sessions. But it’s still up 12% from its Aug. 24 intraday low.
