The pretty clear answer there is no. It's a massive breach of personal privacy.\"\n\nWhen CNNMoney read through the computer code on the Healthcare.gov website on Friday, certain lines of code that indicated the website was sending such personal information during the sign-up process were gone.\n\nCooper Quintin, a staff technologist at EFF, confirmed that the code was gone.\n\n\"That's a great first step for them to take,\" he said.\n\nWhile Healthcare.gov is no longer relaying your personal information on the front end, there's no telling what information might get shared once it is stored in the government's computers, however.\n\n--CNN's Jim Acosta contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "obamacare website, healthcare.gov website, obamacare privacy, healthcare.gov privacy, obamacare website privacy, obamacare website sharing information, jose pagliery, pagliery, tech news, obamacare", "title": "Obamacare website reins in personal data sharing", "og": {"site_name": "CNNMoney", "description": "Healthcare.gov was secretly telling marketers if you smoke.
