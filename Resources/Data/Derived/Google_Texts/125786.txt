(Worthy News) - The administration's Trans-Pacific Partnership treaty legislation is 5,554 pages long, twice that of Obamacare and nearly 3 feet high, a legislative nightmare highlighted in a tweet from Sen. Jeff Sessions Monday.

The Alabama Republican used his photo to alert critics that because the bill is fast-tracked, it cannot be filibustered or amended. Not only is the legislation filled with 2 million words, it measures exactly 2 feet high and weighs an amazing 100 pounds. The TPP is a trade agreement among 12 Pacific Rim countries. [ Source ]
