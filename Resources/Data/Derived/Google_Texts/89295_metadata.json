He may have been in the car for an hour, Officer Jae Berg said.\n\nThe boy\u2019s grandmother called 911 at 1:05 p.m. after she and others could not find him after looking for more than 15 minutes, he said.\n\nMore than a dozen residents, police officers and firefighters did a sweep of the area, including inside the house, a nearby lake and near Highway 174, city spokeswoman Sally Ellertson said in a statement.\n\nA patrol sergeant found the unresponsive boy inside a car parked on the street between the child\u2019s home and a neighbor\u2019s house.\n\nFirefighters and medics performed CPR and tried to cool down Zachary, Berg said. The boy was taken by ambulance to Cook Children\u2019s Medical Center, where he died in the emergency room about 3 p.m., according to the Tarrant County medical examiner.\n\nKansas-based Kids and Cars, a national child safety organization, reported that 15 children have died in hot cars in the U.S. this year. Four have been in Texas.\n\nNorth Texas had a hot car death this year, in July, when a 2-year-old girl was unknowingly left strapped in her safety seat.\n\nJanette Fennell, president and founder of Kids and Cars, said for years, Texas has had more hot car deaths than most states.\n\nShe advised parents to always \u201clook before you lock\u201d to prevent the possibility of forgetting a child in a car.\n\n\u201cThe most important thing that parents need to understand \u2026 they need to understand that this can happen to anyone,\u201d Fennell said. \u201cThe biggest mistake people make is they say, \u2018No this could never happen to me.\u2019\u201d\n\nShe said 33 percent of cases of hot car deaths happen when a child gets into a car and can\u2019t get out. In 54 percent of hot car deaths, parents forget to take their children out of the car.\n\nShe advised parents to always lock their doors and keep their car keys out of reach of children.\n\n\u201cThese vehicles are really attractive to little ones,\u201d she said. \u201cThey may not understand that once you get in \u2026 they may not know how to get out.\u201d\n\nTexas House Bill 2574, which passed in June, requires new parents to receive vehicle heatstroke education, along with other materials, upon discharge from the hospital. That bill goes into effect Sept. 1.\n\nThe temperature reached 98 degrees Sunday afternoon at the Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport.\n\nJan Null, a meteorologist and lecturer at San Jose University, said that a car in 98-degree weather could have an internal temperature of 140 degrees.\n\n\u201cObjects or a person inside the car in direct sunlight would have been significantly hotter,\u201d Null said by email.", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RoZXNjb29wYmxvZy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDE1LzA4LzUteWVhci1vbGQtYm95LWluLWNyaXRpY2FsLWNvbmRpdGlvbi1hZnRlci1wYXNzaW5nLW91dC1pbi1ob3QtY2FyLWluLWJ1cmxlc29uLmh0bWwv", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Danielle Grobmeier", "og": {"site_name": "The Scoop Blog", "description": "[Post updated at 9:32 p.m.] A 5-year-old boy died Sunday after being found inside a hot car in Burleson, according to city officials.
