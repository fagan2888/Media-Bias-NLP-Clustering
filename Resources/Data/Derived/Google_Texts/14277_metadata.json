Phil Bryant (R) was elected in 2011 with 61% of the vote, after winning the Republican Primary with 59%. This year, he is running for reelection. With the February filing deadline fast approaching, Bryant has no opposition so far. \u201cIts going to be just about a walk-in for Bryant\u2026,\u201d says Bill Minor, dean of Mississippi journalists. \u201cBryant might get by unopposed.\u201d (Minor, known for his incisive reporting during the Civil Rights struggles in Mississippi, says, \u201cAt 92, I\u2019m still getting hate mail.\u201d)\n\nTwo Republicans have been mentioned as potential primary challengers to Bryant, but neither is likely to make the race. The better known name is that of state Sen. Chris McDaniel (R), who ran a spirited but unsuccessful race against US Sen. Thad Cochran (R) last year. But a campaign for governor would present different challenges for McDaniel. Hayes Dent, president of a public affairs firm in Jackson, says McDaniel would have several problems, including \u201cfall-out from the 2014 Senate primary,\u201d a very bitter contest that sharply divided the state\u2019s Republicans. Moreover, fundraising for hardcore conservative McDaniel might be more difficult in a race for a state office, mainly devoid of federal issues. Finally, many Tea Partiers are comfortable with Bryant. So the word is that McDaniel is considering a race for either lieutenant governor or attorney general.\n\nThe other GOPer getting mentioned for governor is state Sen. Michael Watson, now in his second term. Watson, 37, was a big supporter of McDaniel last year and would face some of the same problems as McDaniel in running against Bryant. In any case, like McDaniel, says a Jackson insider, \u201cWatson is sitting back and looking to run statewide. He\u2019s waiting to see if there an open statewide office.\u201d\n\nAs for the Democrats, they \u201care really struggling to find someone,\u201d says the Jackson insider, noting that party loyalists have tried to recruit Public Service Commissioner Brandon Presley, former gubernatorial candidate Bill Luckett and former Secretary of State Dick Molpus for the governor\u2019s race. But Presley filed for reelection to the PSC and Luckett and Molpus opted out.\n\nAlso getting mentioned is former US Rep. Travis Childers (D), a moderate with a populist streak, who was the Democratic nominee against Cochran last year, garnering 37% of the vote. But the death of US Rep. Alan Nunnelee (R) last week created a vacancy in the 1st District (Tupelo, etc.), the district that Childers served in Congress from 2008 to 2011. This might provide a more realistic opportunity for him than a statewide race. (\u201cThat special election is going to be huge,\u201d says Dent, with as many as 12 candidates.) In any case, Childers has shown no interest in the governor\u2019s race.\n\nNevertheless, the Democratic Party\u2019s website solicits money for #FirePhil in 2015, criticizing Bryant for the state\u2019s still-high jobless rate and for \u201c230,000 working people\u201d who are without health insurance, a reference to Bryant\u2019s refusal to participate in Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion program. Minor notes that the state would have received $9 billion had it agreed to participate.\n\nBut Bryant\u2019s solid hold on the governor\u2019s office reflects the economic progress the state has made during his tenure. Although Mississippi\u2019s unemployment rate was 7.3% last November, the highest jobless rate of any of the 50 states, it was significantly down from the 9.4% when he took office in January 2012. Moreover, Bryant stays focused on job creation and assistance to low income earners. In his state of the state address in January, he advocated a $50 million expenditure for workforce training, an income tax credit for \u201cworking Mississippians\u201d earning less than $52,000 annually, and $3 million for scholarships for those attending technical schools or community colleges.\n\nWith an absence of drama in the governor\u2019s race, political attention in the state is likely to be on the down-ballot statewide offices. There\u2019s going to be \u201cmusical chairs\u201d in Mississippi, says Dent.\n\nEither McDaniel or Watson might challenge Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves (R), who is not on good terms with the governor. Already Tim Johnson, a former state senator \u2013 and an Elvis impersonator \u2013 switched from the Republican to the Democratic Party and announced that he will challenge Reeves in the General Election. In his announcement, Johnson, 55, said, \u201cThe Republican Party leaders\u2019 actions against supporting Medicaid expansion and threatening our local hospitals was the final, deciding factor for me,\u201d reported the Clarion-Ledger. (State GOP chairman Joe Nosef said, \u201c[T]his begs the question of whether he\u2019s really been a Republican all these years, or just a Republican impersonator.\u201d)\n\nThe other office likely to be contested is that of attorney general. Incumbent Jim Hood is the last statewide Democratic officeholder in the state and continues to be popular. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t get involved in controversial issues,\u201d says the insider. \u201cHe fought the insurance companies post-Katrina\u2026 If he runs again, he should win handily. If he doesn\u2019t, that should be the big race here.\u201d\n\nThe primaries will be held on August 4, with a runoff, if needed, on August 25. The General Election will be held on November 3. All state officials, the legislature, and local offices will be up for election.
