The technology exists and the genie is not going back into the bottle. The problem is we were caught red handed, and then bungled the damage limitation.\n\n\n\nOnce the story leaked, President Obama should have grabbed the phone and called Chancellor Merkel.\n\nCan you imagine if this had happened on Bill Clinton\u2019s watch? He would have called the chancellor right away, schmoozed her, smoothed things over and by the end of the conversation they not only would have figured out how to limit the political fallout, but been the closer for it.\n\nOr, if Obama wanted to be a tough guy he could have said, \u201clook, Angela, you\u2019re probably taping my calls, we\u2019re taping yours, so let\u2019s call it even\u201d.\n\nInstead, Obama waited for Merkel to call him. When she finally did, he apparently gave her the cold shoulder, and had his press secretary say the president knew nothing about what the NSA was doing.\n\nThat\u2019s cold comfort to Merkel and Germans, who have first hand experience with spying from their Nazi and East German Stasi days.\n\nIn the parliamentary elections last month, Chancellor Merkel reassured voters that America was not spying on Germans.\n\nNow it looks like she was played for a fool.\n\nThis causes her political problems at home, as well as in the bilateral relationship. That's bad enough.\n\nBut there is a bigger problem with the NSA spying scandal. The president\u2019s response is the same \"the-dog-ate-my-homework\" excuse he\u2019s given on Fast and Furious, Benghazi, IRS harassment, FBI press wiretaps, and now ObamaCare.\n\nEither the president is lying about these scandals, which is bad enough, or he is telling the truth, which is even worse.\n\nIf the president doesn\u2019t know what his administration is doing, then who does? Has the federal government gotten so big and complicated that it is now on auto-pilot?\n\nDumb policies can be reversed with a change of attitude, or new leadership. But if government is out of control, it will be a lot harder and take much longer to fix.\n\nKathleen Troia \"K.T.\" McFarland is a Fox News National Security Analyst and host of FoxNews.com's \"DefCon 3.\" She served in national security posts in the Nixon, Ford and Reagan administrations", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.modified": "2015-07-15 01:02:04 EDT", "dcterms.abstract": "Once the story leaked, President Obama should have grabbed the phone and called Chancellor Merkel.", "twitter": {"description": "Once the story leaked, President Obama should have grabbed the phone and called Chancellor Merkel.", "creator": "@foxnews", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2013/11/01/nsa-spying-revelations-obamacare-untruths-is-our-government-out-control.html", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-news/opinion/2013/11/01/nsa-spying-revelations-obamacare-untruths-is-our-government-out-control/_jcr_content/par/featured-media/media-1.img.jpg/0/0/1422661436330.jpg?ve=1", "title": "NSA spying revelations, ObamaCare untruths -- is our government out of control?", "site": "@foxnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.publisher": "Fox News", "parsely-metadata": "{\"author\":\"K.T.
