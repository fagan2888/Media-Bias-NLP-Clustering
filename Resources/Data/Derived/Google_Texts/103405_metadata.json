It encourages people to see where their senator stands on the issue.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nTheir ad notes that since 2000, nearly all the job growth in the U.S. has gone to immigrants.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re urging every citizen to ask a very simple question of their Senators \u2014 and of anybody who wants to be a Senator,\u201d NumbersUSA President Roy Beck said. \u201cWho should get the next jobs? Do they think their constituents who are looking for work should have priority for jobs? Or are they committed to catering to special-interest groups and helping corporate lobbyists continue to flood the labor market with new foreign workers who, through no fault of their own, depress the wages and job prospects for workers already here?\u201d\n\nThe new ads, according to a spokeswoman, are backed by a seven-figure buy and will air in Kentucky, Arkansas, North Carolina, Alaska, Georgia, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Iowa, Michigan, and Kansas over the coming weeks.\n\n\u201cPolling shows that most Americans believe annual legal immigration should be reduced to improve the jobs and wages for American workers,\u201d Beck said. \u201cBut many in Congress don\u2019t agree.\u201d\n\nThe ad encourages people to go to Number USA\u2019s website to see how their senator scores based on the group\u2019s immigration criteria. For example, Sen. Kay Hagan (D-NC) has an F, Sen. Mark Pryor (D-AR) boasts a D, Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) has an F, Sen Mark Begich (D-AK) has an F, and Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-KY) has a B+.\n\nWatch the new ad:", "article_metadata": {"description": "Numbers USA Launches New Ad Campaign Stressing Immigration's Negative Impact on American Jobs", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Numbers USA Launches New Ad Campaign Stressing Immigration's Negative Impact on American Jobs", "title": "Numbers USA Launches New Ad Campaign Stressing Immigration's Negative Impact on American Jobs - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Government/2014/10/15/Stop-Illegal-Immigrationpng.png", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2014/10/15/numbers-usa-launches-new-ad-campaign-stressing-immigration-s-negative-impact-on-american-jobs/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Numbers USA Launches New Ad Campaign Stressing Immigration's Negative Impact on American Jobs", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Government/2014/10/15/Stop-Illegal-Immigrationpng.png", "title": "Numbers USA Launches New Ad Campaign Stressing Immigration's Negative Impact on American Jobs - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Mark Pryor, Mitch McConnell, Senate,Big Government,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "Senate", "published_time": "2014-10-15T11:01:21-07:00", "categories": "Big Government"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2989\"", "article_summary": "For example, Sen.
