The program covers 7 million adults and 5 million children who are enrolled in Medi-Cal, the state\u2019s version of Medicaid for low-income Americans.\n\n\u201cWe have been serving underserved communities in the state for over 50 years. Unfortunately, given the situation with the Denti-Cal program, we\u2019ve been forced to question our continued participation,\u201d Castellanos said.\n\n\u201cThe rates are very low. The rates have not been increased since 2001,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had an additional rate cut in 2013. Salaries, rents, everything goes up every year.\u201d\n\nLast year, Western Dental provided care to 562,672 Medi-Cal recipients statewide, according to the state Department of Health Care Services.\n\n\u201cWe are working to ensure that all impacted Medi-Cal members will have access to quality dental care,\u201d department spokesman Tony Cava said in an email.\n\nEarlier this month, Moody\u2019s Investors Services downgraded Western Dental\u2019s parent company, Premier Dental Services, noting \u201cdeclining levels of government reimbursement\u201d and the increase in adults with Denti-Cal because of Obamacare, which last year expanded the number of California adults eligible for Medi-Cal.\n\n\u201cIn addition, the higher frequency of Denti-Cal patient visits is also displacing higher-paying, out-of pocket or commercial insurance customers, resulting in a lower average reimbursement rate for the company's services,\u201d Moody\u2019s wrote in the report.\n\nCastellanos said Denti-Cal patients account for half of the company\u2019s business.\n\n\u201cThe concentration of Denti-Cal patients in our facilties is overwhelming,\u201d he said.\n\nThe change could affect local nonprofit dental providers if Denti-Cal patients can\u2019t find new dentists.\n\n\u201cI think you\u2019ll see people having to go to the community clinics for that, because where else will they go?\u201d said Pamela Austin, executive director of the Gary Center, a La Habra nonprofit that offers dental care.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what other commercial, for-profit companies would provide that. You\u2019re losing money the minute they walk in the door, the reimbursement is so poor.\u201d\n\nCastellanos said he expects other Western Dental offices will be forced to turn away Denti-Cal patients as the company continues assessing its finances. To further cut costs, he said, two undisclosed clinics in California will close.\n\nThe company also announced last week that about 200 California employees will be laid off. Western Dental employs about 3,600 people statewide.\n\nCastellanos said the company will continue accepting Medicaid patients in other states where it operates, because reimbursement rates there are higher.\n\nContact the writer: cperkes@ocregister.com 714-796-3686", "article_metadata": {"content_section": "undef", "description": "Life: Low income patients could be denied dental coverage | cal, dental, denti, patients, company, western, care, reimbursement, castellanos, state", "author": "COURTNEY PERKES", "og": {"site_name": "The Orange County Register", "description": "Orange-based Western Dental will stop accepting some new patients from Denti-Cal, a state-run dental program for low-income residents, because of insufficient reimbursement and a surge of new customers who have gained the coverage through the health care reform known as Obamacare.", "title": "Orange-based dental provider to stop accepting some low income patients from state-run program", "url": "http://www.ocregister.com/articles/cal-662685-dental-denti.html", "image": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/ocregister/gallery/noq6o1-b88415233z.120150521172649000gli9q56g.10.jpg", "locale": "en-US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/ocregister/gallery/noq6o1-b88415233z.120150521172649000gli9q56g.10.jpg"}, "description": "Orange-based Western Dental will stop accepting some new patients from Denti-Cal, a state-run dental program for low-income residents, because of insufficient reimbursement and a surge of new customer", "site": "@ocregister", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Orange-based dental provider to stop accepting some low income patients from state-run program"}, "content_author": "COURTNEY PERKES", "fb": {"app_id": 107698536003308}, "content_thumbnail": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/ocregister/thumb/noq6o1-b88415233z.120150521172649000gli9q56g.10.jpg", "content_type": "article", "Keywords": "cal, dental, denti, patients, company, western, care, reimbursement, castellanos, state", "publication_date": "2015-05-21", "access-type": "paid", "section": "undef", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "content_title": "Orange-based dental provider to stop accepting some low income patients from state-run program"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd0a8\"", "article_summary": "The company has 150 offices in the state and is the largest provider of dental care to patients insured by Denti-Cal.\n\u201cWe are working to ensure that all impacted Medi-Cal members will have access to quality dental care,\u201d department spokesman Tony Cava said in an email.\nThe change could affect local nonprofit dental providers if Denti-Cal patients can\u2019t find new dentists.\n\u201cThe concentration of Denti-Cal patients in our facilties is overwhelming,\u201d he said.\nWestern Dental employs about 3,600 people statewide."}
