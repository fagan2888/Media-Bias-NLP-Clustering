He then went inside the home and told his girlfriend to retrieve his gun, authorities said.\n\nRodriguez got back in his vehicle with his girlfriend and drove until he found 36-year-old Enrique Rodriguez Garcia and another man a few blocks away, at Estelle and California Avenue, authorities said.\n\nRodriguez stopped driving and from his car questioned the men for about five to seven minutes, when he and Garcia began to argue, Hillsborough County sheriff\u2019s spokeswoman Cristal Bermudez Nunez said, citing an arrest affidavit.\n\nGarcia then moved his left arm toward Rodriguez, who fired a shot, killing Garcia, the affidavit said. Garcia was not armed, authorities said.\n\nRodriguez did not attempt to drive away or remove himself from the situation, Nunez said. After the shooting, he returned to his home, dropped off his girlfriend and the gun, and drove to a friend\u2019s house, according to the affidavit.\n\nThe friend called authorities to report the shooting about 4:35 a.m., as deputies were responding to another call about the shooting. They found the body of Garcia in the street with a gunshot wound to the upper body, Nunez said.\n\nGarcia, 36, was homeless, Nunez said.\n\nDeputies went to the friend\u2019s house and met with Rodriguez, who was detained and interviewed. He was later booked at the Hillsborough County Jail without bail.\n\nThe man who was with Garcia was at the scene when deputies arrived, Nunez said. He is considered a witness.", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sat, 03 Jan 2015 14:56:08 -0400", "Description": "A Gibsonton man faces a murder charge after using his car to chase two people he caught in his yard and fatally shooting one of them during a confrontation, deputies said.", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "A Gibsonton man faces a murder charge after using his car to chase two people he caught in his yard and fatally shooting one of them during a confrontation, deputies said.", "title": "Deputies: Gibsonton man pursues intruders, fatally shoots one", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/news/crime/deputies-gibsonton-man-pursues-intruders-fatally-shoots-one-20150103/", "image": {"width": 384, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20150103/ARTICLE/150109846/AR/0/AR-150109846.jpg", "height": 324}, "updated_time": "2015-01-03T15:29:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "tbo.com", "description": "A Gibsonton man faces a murder charge after using his car to chase two people he caught in his yard and fatally shooting one of them during a confrontation, deputies said.", "title": "Deputies: Gibsonton man pursues intruders, fatally shoots one", "image": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20150103/ARTICLE/150109846/AR/0/AR-150109846.jpg", "site": "@TBOcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2015-01-03T14:56:08Z-04", "modified_time": "2015-01-03T15:29:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd23c1\"", "article_summary": "The man who was with Garcia was at the scene when deputies arrived, Nunez said.\nA Gibsonton man faces a murder charge after using his car to chase two people he caught in his yard and fatally shooting one of them during a confrontation, deputies said.\nThe friend called authorities to report the shooting about 4:35 a.m., as deputies were responding to another call about the shooting.\nRuben Rodriguez, 29, told sheriff\u2019s detectives he returned his home, at 6207 Estelle Ave., about 3:30 a.m. Saturday and saw the intruders running away.\nRodriguez got back in his vehicle with his girlfriend and drove until he found 36-year-old Enrique Rodriguez Garcia and another man a few blocks away, at Estelle and California Avenue, authorities said."}
