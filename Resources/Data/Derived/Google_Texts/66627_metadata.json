So far, 27 states and the District of Columbia have expanded Medicaid, and several more states, including some with Republican leadership, are considering Medicaid expansion, FierceHealthPayer previously reported. In its report, Families USA called for the expansion of Medicaid to all states.\n\nIn those expansion states--along with Wisconsin, which did not expand Medicaid as a whole but did offer it to childless adults--childless adults who earn less than $16,105 annually now qualify for Medicaid, noted the latest Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF) survey of Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) eligibility, enrollment, renewal and cost-sharing policies. In non-expansion states, they do not qualify at all.\n\nMedicaid coverage for children and pregnant women remains high across the board, according to KFF. CHIP covers children at or above 200 percent of the FPL in all but two states, with 19 of those states covering them at or above 300 percent, according to the report. In addition to making more children eligible for the program, 33 states have eliminate the waiting period when a child must be without group coverage before enrolling.\n\nThe ACA protects the coverage for children until 2019--though without Congressional action, funding for CHIP will expire in September, causing some children to face higher premiums and others to lose coverage altogether, the report stated.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read the Kaiser Family Foundation report\n\n- check out Families USA's Health Reform 2.0 report (.pdf)\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nMedicaid expansion roundup: Where are all the states now?\n\nTexas and Florida remain wary to expand Medicaid\n\nAfter momentum surge, Medicaid expansion may contract\n\nPush is on to expand Medicaid in Kansas, Wyoming", "article_metadata": {"description": "Medicaid expansion has been particularly beneficial to low-income adults without children, many of whom had not been previously able to obtain coverage through their employers.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthPayer", "description": "Medicaid expansion has been particularly beneficial to low-income adults without children, many of whom had not been previously able to obtain coverage through their employers.", "title": "Childless adults biggest winners under Medicaid expansion", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthpayer.com/story/childless-adults-biggest-winners-under-medicaid-expansion/2015-01-23", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthpayer.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "healthpayer", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "keywords": "low-income children,Medicaid Expansion,Medicare,Medicaid,CHIP,Pregnant Women,working adults", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Medicare,Medicaid,CHIP"}, "article_summary": "Texas and Florida remain wary to expand MedicaidAfter momentum surge, Medicaid expansion may contractPush is on to expand Medicaid in Kansas, Wyoming\nSo far, 27 states and the District of Columbia have expanded Medicaid, and several more states, including some with Republican leadership, are considering Medicaid expansion, FierceHealthPayer previously reported.\nIn its report, Families USA called for the expansion of Medicaid to all states.\nMedicaid coverage for children and pregnant women remains high across the board, according to KFF.\nHistorically, adults without children have been excluded from Medicaid, noted the advocacy group."}
