Just last week, her co-worker had a run-in with that man and gave her a description of what he looked like and how he acted.\n\n\u201cConversations he was having with the realtor and questions he would ask and mannerisms and this gentleman fit that to a T,\u201d Touchatt said.\n\nTouchatt was alone in the house with the man, so she pretended like nothing was wrong.\n\n\u201cYou just never know how people are going to react when backed into a corner so I didn't want to question him. I was just scared to death,\u201d Touchatt said.\n\nShe kept calm and texted her husband and the homeowner, asking them to call 911.\n\nWhen a 911 operator called her, she kept playing it cool. She answered their questions with a yes or no and pretended like she was talking to a potential home buyer.\n\n\u201cI did ask him if he was prequalified for a home loan, I tried to talk to him like a normal client,\u201d Touchatt said.\n\nTouchatt's plan worked. When the man finally left, police were already in the area and pulled him over just a block away. They found a bottle of prescription narcotics on him they say he took from the home.\n\n\u201cIt's irritating, you can't trust anybody,\u201d the homeowner Jesse Soria said.\n\n\u201cI was very scared but I surprised myself at remaining calm,\u201d Touchatt said.\n\nPolice haven't released the man's name yet but they did say he was arrested in 2010 for doing the same thing, stealing prescription narcotics during an open house.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "A Wichita real estate agent catches a man raiding the medicine cabinets during an open house and police say the same guy has been doing the same thing all over town.", "language": "english", "author": "Parrish Alleman", "og": {"description": "A Wichita real estate agent catches a man raiding the medicine cabinets during an open house and police say the same guy has been doing the same thing all over town.", "title": "Real estate agent helps catch prescription drug thief posing as potential home buyer", "url": "http://www.kake.com/findit/sundayheadlines/Real-estate-agent-helps-catch-thief-posing-as-potential-home-buyer-231384571.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/iupl/D17/873/D17873DE247E499796A595EA45C2D629", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/870/A83/870A8345817A43A6988824E807F61693.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kake.com", "description": "A Wichita real estate agent catches a man raiding the medicine cabinets during an open house and police say the same guy has been doing the same thing all over town.", "creator": "@KAKEnews", "url": "http://www.kake.com/findit/sundayheadlines/Real-estate-agent-helps-catch-thief-posing-as-potential-home-buyer-231384571.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/Open_house_drug_thief.jpg", "title": "Real estate agent helps catch prescription drug thief posing as potential home buyer", "site": "@KAKEnews", "card": "summary"}, "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Real estate agent helps catch prescription drug thief posing as potential home buyer", "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "google-site-verification": "H0mev8O__gMqb34WcvOyZgBXFMRQZvDAQ0YTSGJ9hGQ", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Real estate agent helps catch, prescription drug thief posing as"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdbd5\"", "article_summary": "A Wichita real estate agent catches a man raiding the medicine cabinets during an open house and police say the same guy has been doing the same thing all over town.\nPolice say the man arrested today on west Pawnee is responsible for at least two similar incidents in the last few months.\nPolice haven't released the man's name yet but they did say he was arrested in 2010 for doing the same thing, stealing prescription narcotics during an open house.\nShe answered their questions with a yes or no and pretended like she was talking to a potential home buyer.\nTouchatt was alone in the house with the man, so she pretended like nothing was wrong."}
