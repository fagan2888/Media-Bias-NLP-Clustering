How would you react if you got a survey call from SWEPCO regarding its power-line proposal?

The people and the Spirits of the land tell me that the power-line proposal is not a good idea. We need to keep our environment as natural and safe as possible.

Larry Foster

"EagleD"

I feel I don't have enough information about the whole thing to answer a survey, because I try to be thorough and would want to know all sides.

Carol White

"Cowgirl Judy"

Caller ID is wonderful!

Kristina Keck

"Grandma's Helper"

I don't live here, so I'd tell my 90-year old-grandmother to say No Way! No Way!

Char Cato

"ObamaCare Contact"

They need to face up to the reality that the powerline project is bad and will impact this area in ways that they will never realize until it's too late.

Hillary Fogerty

"Professor Girl"

"SWEPCO has failed to consider environmental and social impact of their plans, demonstrating a cavalier attitude toward the very communities they profess to serve. I cannot in trust any proposal they make, nor support any expansion of power lines through Ozarkan communities."
