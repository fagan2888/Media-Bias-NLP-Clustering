My family got ensnared in the 1095-A paperwork pit.

From \u201cOctober 2014 to June 2014\u201d?\n\nWe were finally able to un-enroll in the ObamaCare plan.\n\nThen, after being bounced around by the exchange to various voicemail dead ends, with hours of migraine-inducing on-hold music, we were told there\u2019s absolutely nothing wrong with the 1095-A form \u2014 which shows payment of premiums we didn\u2019t pay to a plan we never enrolled in and didn\u2019t want in the first place.\n\nThis is just one little horror story. In California, at least 800,000 taxpayers got screwed-up 1095-As.\n\nAs a result, some 50,000 people filed the wrong form. Another 750,000 were told they\u2019ll get corrected forms this month. Hah! Good luck with that.\n\nThe costs in time, money and anxiety to hardworking families dealing with this paperwork perdition are enormous.\n\nUnknown numbers of people are still waiting for their forms as April 15 looms. More face the added expense and aggravation of filing amended returns through no fault of their own.\n\nMost of the media have been insulated from these problems because they get their insurance through their employers.\n\nBut one other journalist smacked head-first into reality. Laura Krantz, a former NPR staffer, is now a Scripps Fellow in environmental journalism at the University of Colorado, Boulder.\n\nEarlier this month, she found out that Connect for Health Colorado had mysteriously canceled her health and dental insurance.\n\nAfter four days in phone hell, she learned she had lost her insurance coverage and her tax credit \u2014 and had to redo all of her paperwork.\n\nShe still believes the ultimate solution is \u201csingle payer.\u201d But another liberal who entered 1095-A hell has seen the light.\n\nSan Franciscan Melissa Klein, a former President Obama supporter, exposed her ordeal with Covered California last week. The exchange botched her 1095-A, then insisted she\u2019d never enrolled despite invoices documenting her payments.\n\nAfter hours in phone hell, her case remains unresolved, and she can\u2019t file her taxes. How is it, she wondered, that \u201cAmazon can ship something to NYC in an hour,\u201d but the White House and Covered California \u201ccan\u2019t create a health-care system that functions\u201d?\n\nKlein concluded, better late than never: \u201cI no longer believe that the government should mandate health care \u2026 A great idea is just an idea if you can\u2019t execute.
