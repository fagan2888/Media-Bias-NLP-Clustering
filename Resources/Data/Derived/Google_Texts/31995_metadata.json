The top managers for the two Democratic candidates discussed the DNC\u2019s authority to determine the number of debates.\n\nThe DNC has sanctioned four debates before the Iowa caucus next year, two fewer than in the \u201908 election cycle, and mandated that the candidates do not participate in any outside debates.\n\n\n\nO\u2019Malley and Sanders have both protested the limited number of debates this cycle.\n\nSign up for and more view example\n\n\u201cOver here on our side there\u2019s no debate,\u201d said O\u2019Malley on Tuesday on New Hampshire radio, criticizing the DNC\u2019s one sanctioned debate in the Granite State on December 19. \u201cRight now, the DNC in a very strange way, unprecedented, never before, is telling the people of New Hampshire that the Democratic Party can only afford one debate that\u2019s going to happen at the height of Christmas shopping season, which adds insult to the injury.\u201d\n\nFor O\u2019Malley, who is trailing in the polls, televised public debates would provide a crucial venue to gain name recognition among voters and jumpstart his campaign. His campaign has alleged that the DNC\u2019s rules unfairly favor frontrunner Hillary Clinton.\n\nSanders has also repeatedly called for more debates, saying that he is \u201cdisappointed\u201d with the DNC\u2019s rules.\n\nBut the Vermont Senator, who is attracting large crowds at campaign rallies\u2014including 28,000 at a recent event in Portland\u2014is less eager than O\u2019Malley to pursue a path that would put him at odds with the Democratic Party. He is highly unlikely to participate in a debate that does not include Clinton, and his campaign spokesman said Wednesday that the debates must include all candidates.\n\nTad Devine, a top advisor to Sanders, called the \u201cdebate debate\u201d a \u201cdistraction.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re looking to be part of some splinter group or something like that,\u201d said Devine. \u201cOur view is we want to work with the Party and not against it.\u201d\n\nThe DNC\u2019s exclusivity rule, which threatens candidates with exclusion from debates if they hold debates outside the sanctioned six, is new. In 2008, Clinton and Barack Obama debated more than a dozen times before the Iowa caucus, mostly outside the DNC framework.\n\nA lawyer for O\u2019Malley\u2019s campaign has said the DNC\u2019s exclusivity rule is \u201clegally unenforceable,\u201d arguing that under Federal Election Commission rules, the format and structure of debates is controlled by the debate sponsor, and not by the political party. O\u2019Malley and Sanders have both called for a more open debate process.\n\n\u201cI do not believe it\u2019s enough,\u201d Sanders said on the debate. \u201cDebates are one way to engage people in the democratic process.\u201d He said Wednesday he would like to see the AFL-CIO or other groups sponsor additional debates.\n\nThe DNC has defended the number of debates, saying the number of debates is sufficient for the candidates. Clinton has declined to comment on whether she thinks the number of debates is sufficient, saying she is eager to debate her rivals for the Democratic nomination.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to show up for the debates as they are scheduled, and I look forward to having robust good opportunity to exchange views with my fellow candidates,\u201d Clinton said in New Hampshire earlier this month.\n\nO\u2019Malley on Tuesday also challenged Clinton to speak out for more debates among the Democratic candidates for president, saying that he has waited for her to speak out.\n\n\u201cI have called upon Secretary Clinton herself in fact to call for more debates and the silence has been deafening,\u201d said O\u2019Malley in his Wednesday radio interview. \u201cWhat we should be doing is having a debate about the issues that matter to people around their kitchen table.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Martin O'Malley\u2019s campaign has reached out to Bernie Sanders about arranging debates outside those sanction by the party.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "In a bid to put pressure on Hillary Clinton.", "title": "Martin O'Malley Lobbies Bernie Sanders For More Debates", "url": "http://time.com/4001669/martin-omalley-bernie-sanders-debates/", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/gettyimages-484059570.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/gettyimages-484059570.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012"}, "description": "In a bid to put pressure on Hillary Clinton.", "site": "TIME", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Martin O'Malley Lobbies Bernie Sanders For More Debates"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "keywords": "martin o'malley debates, hillary clinton debates, debates, democratic debates, bernie sanders debates", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/time"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Martin O'Malley debates, Hillary Clinton debates, debates, Democratic debates, Bernie Sanders debates"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbad5\"", "article_summary": "Dave Hamrick, the manager of O\u2019Malley\u2019s campaign, called Sanders\u2019 campaign manager, Jeff Weaver, an O\u2019Malley spokeswoman confirmed.\nTad Devine, a top advisor to Sanders, called the \u201cdebate debate\u201d a \u201cdistraction.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re looking to be part of some splinter group or something like that,\u201d said Devine.\nO\u2019Malley and Sanders have both protested the limited number of debates this cycle.\nThe top managers for the two Democratic candidates discussed the DNC\u2019s authority to determine the number of debates.\nO\u2019Malley and Sanders have both called for a more open debate process."}
