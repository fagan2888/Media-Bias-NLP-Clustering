We were in a good mood. We\u2019d just returned from the shooting range, where I\u2019d managed to jam an AK-47 three times because I\u2019m from Massachusetts. But the meeting was about that Obamacare, and the mood went from jubilant to about as dour as its been in this office for a long time.\n\nWe were getting downgraded. All of us. The folks with babies, the folks sending kids off to college and the folks just starting out in life. Down two levels, too. See, health care is complicated, so the folks here in Washington made it simple for us Americans: There\u2019s now four levels\u2013 bronze, silver, gold and platinum. To simplify, for small businesses like us, they made everything else \u2014 including a better plan \u2014 illegal. And we were going down two.\n\nNo one gets rich here at TheDC. To earn a little extra, I tend bar on the weekends (I love that job). One woman parks cars; another works as a sous chef; one guy does videography work at night; some of us write for magazines. We work here because we love the job, and we love our coworkers and our bosses. We go on fun trips, we laugh all day and we retire to the bar \u201cthe colonel\u201d let us build in the back. But when you hike the cost of health care by an average of 57 percent in our office alone, we all take a hit. And to complicate it further, in order to find out just how screwed we are, we have to personally visit our office manager, who has to ask us how old we are so she can use government charts to figure out what we have to pay.\n\nIt\u2019s the brainchild of the privileged, and millionaire intellectuals who think we workers don\u2019t understand what\u2019s good for us, and it\u2019s meant to help. Affordable Care Act, it\u2019s called.\n\nAfter a few backroom discussions about how far we could get if we overthrew Tucker, I decided to just grumble to my beer.\n\nThen I saw this group \u201cOut 2 Enroll,\u201d which had tweeted the following.\n\nTOMORROW: The health care marketplace opens up. #ReadySetEnroll! pic.twitter.com/S5UhLfLKWj \u2014 Out2Enroll (@Out2Enroll) November 14, 2014\n\n\n\nAnd then I realized I\u2019m living in a world where my health care costs explode, my coverage goes down and liberal groups celebrate this by tweeting images of clowns on trains flying down mountains in fantasy land. And I\u2019m somehow a jerk because Sarah Palin is an idiot, or something.\n\nOh, and \u201ccheck your privilege,\u201d bartender.\n\nFollow Bedford on Twitter and Facebook", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Christopher Bedford", "description": "Even its biggest fans think Obamacare is a fantasy clown train barreling off the page", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "On Thursday, The Daily Caller had a rare mandatory staff meeting.
