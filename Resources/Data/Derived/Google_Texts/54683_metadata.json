Moreover, the Board denied Patent Owner\u2019s Motion to Amend because it found that Patent Owner had not shown that its proposed substitute claims 17, 18, and 20-25 were patentable over the prior art. The Board noted that claims 2 and 11-16 were not at issue in this proceeding because the Board had declined to institute inter partesreview of these in its Decision to Institute.\n\nThe \u2019936 patent relates to \u201ca language independent software development tool having a graphical user interface, also referred to as an Integrated Development Environment or IDE.\u201d The IDE exchanges, edits, debugs, visualizes, and develops software code for \u201cdata manipulation centric languages.\u201d The disclosed IDE includes a visualizer that allows for the display of code in ways different than a typical text editor.\n\nThe Board\u2019s Decision to Institute had expressly construed the claim term \u201cdata manipulation language\u201d to mean \u201ca programming language used to access data in a database, such as to retrieve, insert, delete, or modify data in the database,\u201d and the claim term \u201cgraphical representation of flows\u201d to mean \u201ca diagram that depicts a map of the progression (or path) through the source code.\u201d Nonetheless, because the Board found that many of the arguments relating to obviousness were more accurately viewed as claim construction issues, the Board also construed other claim terms as well.\n\nThe Board maintained its initial construction for the claim term \u201cdata manipulation language,\u201d finding that the change proposed by Patent Owner did not affect the Board\u2019s substantive analysis and that Patent Owner\u2019s arguments that the Board should depart from the dictionary definition proffered by Dr. Nick Roussopoulos (Petitioner\u2019s declarant) were not persuasive. The Board was also not persuaded by the testimony of Mr. Ivan Zatkovich (Patent Owner\u2019s declarant) on this point. The Board was not persuaded that its initial construction for the claim term \u201cgraphical representation of flows\u201d needed any modification either.\n\nAs for certain claim terms not previously construed, the Board went on to analyze terminology such as \u201cprogram flows\u201d (dependent claim 3) and \u201cdata flows\u201d (dependent claim 4). The Board then went on to discuss the prior art.\n\nIn this connection, the Board maintained its preliminary finding that claim 1 is unpatentable based on the combination of Coad and the Oracle and Oracle8 Primers. Although Petitioner disputed this finding, the Board concluded that Petitioner\u2019s assertions on this point were based on claim constructions that the Board had not adopted, and that certain testimony by Mr. Zatkovich (Patent Owner\u2019s own declarant) was in agreement with the Board\u2019s position.\n\nRegarding Petitioner\u2019s challenge that claims 1 and 3-10 would have been obvious in view of Antis taken in combination with Coad (claims 1, 3, 5, 6, 8, and 10) or in view of Antis taken in combination with Coad and one other reference (claims 4, 7, and 9), the Board maintained that independent claim 1 was unpatentable in view of the obvious combination of Antis and Coad. Then, after noting that Patent Owner had not separately argued the patentability of certain claims depending from independent claim 1, namely, dependent claims 5, 6, 8, and 10, the Board likewise concluded that these dependent claims were unpatentable as having been obvious in view of Antis and Coad.\n\nIn related fashion, the Board found that dependent claim 3 was unpatentable as having been obvious in view of Antis taken in combination with Coad. Although there was conflicting evidence on this point, the Board credited the evidence proffered by Petitioner \u2013 especially the testimony of Dr. Roussopoulos \u2013 which the Board found was supported by objective evidence. The Board contrasted this with Patent Owner\u2019s evidence, which, according to the Board, was based on unpersuasive and unsupported testimony.\n\nThe Board found that Petitioner had not shown by a preponderance of the evidence that dependent claim 4 would have been obvious in view of Coad, Antis, and Burkwald. According to the Board, for example, the conclusions of Dr. Roussopoulos\u2019s were unsupported on this point.\n\nThe Board next addressed dependent claims 7 and 9. For essentially the same reasons as discussed in connection with independent claim 1, the Board concluded that claim 7 was unpatentable in view of the obvious combination of Antis, Coad, and Eick, and that claim 9 was unpatentable based on the obvious combination of Antis, Coad, and Building Applications.\n\nThe Board denied Patent Owner\u2019s Contingent Motion to Amend, which sought to replace claims 1 and 3-10 with proposed, amended claims 17-25 (in the event that claims 1 and 3-10 were, respectively, were found to be unpatentable). According to the Board, Patent Owner had not met its burden of showing that the amended claims were patentable not only over the prior art references applied to the original patent claims, but also over other IDE\u2019s known in the art. And even if Patent Owner\u2019s burden to show that the claims as proposed to be amended were patentable over the prior art of record, the Board said that it would still not be persuaded that the proposed claims were patentable over Coad viewed in combination with either the Oracle Primers or Antis.\n\nSAS Institute, Inc. v.
