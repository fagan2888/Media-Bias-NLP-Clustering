This includes increased support for the PulseNet surveillance system and outbreak response and for the Integrated Food Safety Centers of Excellence to establish a new Northeast Regional center.\n\nMore than $2 million will also to help states build their capacity for advanced molecular detection, an emerging field that combines next-generation genomic sequencing with bioinformatics to more quickly identify and respond to disease outbreaks.\n\nCDC funds all 50 state health departments, six local health departments, and eight territories or U.S. affiliates through the ELC mechanism. The funding helps pay the salaries of nearly 1,500 epidemiologists, lab technicians, and health information systems staff in the state, territorial, local, and tribal health departments.\n\n(To sign up for a free subscription to Food Safety News, click here.)\n\n\u00a9 Food Safety News", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Food Safety News", "description": "On Monday, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced funding for states to help them fight infectious disease outbreaks more quickly and develop better interventions to protect the public\u2019s health.
