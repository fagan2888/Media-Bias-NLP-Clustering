An attempted traffic stop leads to a dramatic high speed chase across the metro on Monday afternoon.

It ended with the suspect crashing out and trying to hide inside a home near N.E. 50th and Douglas.

There were several people inside the home. They said they were playing a video game when the suspect, who happens to be their next door neighbor, dashed through the door and told them police were after him.

The chase started near I-35 and S.E. 44th. The driver recklessly weaving in and out of traffic going up to 115 miles per hour down Wilshire Boulevard.

The suspect, identified as Deontae Thomas, 22, took off running. He eve even ran passed his own house and then into his neighbor’s home. The neighbor said the suspect is no stranger. He’s known him for years.

“We were playing a game and he just knocked on the back door and came in,” said the neighbor, who didn’t want to share his name. “We were like, what’s going on? And he’s like; they’re after me or something!”

The house was surrounded by dozens of troopers on the ground and two news helicopters in the air. One of the men was able to convince Thomas to go back outside and surrender. Thomas was taken into custody. Police also confiscated his black back pack; he was seen carrying throughout the chase.

Troopers said it was empty, but it smelled of marijuana.

The motorcycle turned out to be stolen. Thomas is sitting in jail, facing a number of different charges.
