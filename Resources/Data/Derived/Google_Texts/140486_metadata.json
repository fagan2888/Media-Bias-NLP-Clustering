Airmen previously could defer their fitness assessment for six months after giving birth.\n\nThe ease on fitness testing for new mothers aligns with other recent changes announced by the Air Force to boost retention of female airmen, who struggle to balance their careers with having a family. New mothers now can defer a deployment for up to a year after giving birth, up from the current six months dwell time. Also, for one year, they are exempt from temporary duty and short tours or assignments in which dependents are restricted from accompanying them.\n\nThe new deferments apply to airmen who gave birth on or after March 6, 2015. The service says it doesn\u2019t anticipate significant mission or readiness issues from the changes.\n\nThe goal of the new policy is to alleviate the strain on talented airmen \u201cwho choose to leave the Air Force as they struggle to balance deployments and family issues, and this is especially true soon after childbirth,\u201d Secretary of the Air Force Deborah Lee James said in a statement.\n\nThe Air Force \u201crecognizes the potential retention benefits\u201d associated with providing female airmen \u201coptions that allow them to serve and support their family without having to choose one over the other,\u201d she said.\n\nJames announced during a speech this spring that the Air Force would increase deployment dwell times for new mothers.\n\nNews on extention of the fitness testing window comes on the heels of the Navy\u2019s announcement earlier this month that it would triple its maternity leave, from six to 18 weeks, for women in the Navy and Marine Corps.\n\nThe Air Force says it\u2019s researching \u201copportunities, in conjunction with the Department of Defense, to extend the maternity and convalescent leave period\u201d in a similar fashion to what the Navy is doing.\n\nAirmen and soldiers currently receive six weeks of maternity leave.\n\nsvan.jennifer@stripes.com", "article_metadata": {"DC.description": "To keep talented female airmen after they start a family or expand on one, the U.S. Air Force is giving women more time to get into shape following childbirth.", "description": "To keep talented female airmen after they start a family or expand on one, the U.S. Air Force is giving women more time to get into shape following childbirth.", "title": "Female airmen have more time to get into shape after having a child", "og": {"type": "article", "image": "http://www.stripes.com/polopoly_fs/1.356131.1435877449!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_490/image.jpg", "site_name": "Stars and Stripes", "description": "To keep talented female airmen after they start a family or expand on one, the U.S. Air Force is giving women more time to get into shape following childbirth.", "title": "Female airmen have more time to get into shape after having a child"}, "pinterest": "nopin", "robots": "ACAP allow-index", "GOOGLEBOT": "index, follow", "fb": {"admins": 100001735654878, "page_id": 45623437315, "app_id": 165185360164551, "pages": 45623437315}, "google-site-verification": "hlKKPUwK4Mj52FGnItKp6N6dig0k7ssfOeVtcespZ_0", "keywords": "Air Force Europe", "organization": "Stars and Stripes", "DC.subject": "Air Force Europe", "DC.title": "Female airmen have more time to get into shape after having a child"}, "article_summary": "KAISERSLAUTERN, Germany \u2014 To keep talented female airmen after they start a family or expand on one, the U.S. Air Force is giving women more time to get into shape following childbirth.\nJames announced during a speech this spring that the Air Force would increase deployment dwell times for new mothers.\nThe Air Force \u201crecognizes the potential retention benefits\u201d associated with providing female airmen \u201coptions that allow them to serve and support their family without having to choose one over the other,\u201d she said.\nThe ease on fitness testing for new mothers aligns with other recent changes announced by the Air Force to boost retention of female airmen, who struggle to balance their careers with having a family.\nAirmen and soldiers currently receive six weeks of maternity leave."}
