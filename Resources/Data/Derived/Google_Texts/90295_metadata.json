That's got to be a top priority,\" he said.\n\n\"(W)hen it comes to immigration reform, we have to remind ourselves that there are people behind the statistics, that there are lives that are being impacted,\" Obama said, referring to the more than 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the country.\n\n\"(P)utting things off for another year, another two years, another three years, it hurts people. It hurts our economy. It hurts families,\" the president added.\n\nThe Senate approved last June a bipartisan bill that strengthens border security and includes a path to citizenship for the undocumented.\n\nThe Republicans who control the House presented in late January their immigration-reform policy, which only contemplates a guarantee of citizenship for young people who were brought into the country as children and are now enrolled in college or are serving in the Armed Forces.\n\nFollow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatino\n\nLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino", "article_metadata": {"classification": "POLITICS/Immigration, POLITICS/White House, COUNTRIES/USA", "dcterms.modified": "2014-02-15 12:44:15 EST", "dcterms.abstract": "President Barack Obama said during a radio interview that immigration reform will pass before he leaves office in January 2017.", "twitter": {"image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/global.fncstatic.com/static/managed/img/fn-latino/politics/0/0/Obama%20Immigration%20Reform%20Speech.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "site": "@foxnewslatino", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@foxnewslatino"}, "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.publisher": "Fox News Latino", "parsely-metadata": "{\"title\":\"Obama: Immigration Reform Will Pass Before Leaving Office\",\"link\":\"http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/politics/2014/02/15/obama-immigration-reform-will-pass-before-leaving-office/\",\"image_url\":\"http://a57.foxnews.com/global.fncstatic.com/static/managed/img/fn-latino/politics/0/0/Obama%20Immigration%20Reform%20Speech.jpg?ve=1&tl=1\",\"type\":\"article\",\"identifier\":\"f118d3655a634410VgnVCM100000d7c1a8c0RCRD\",\"section\":\"politics\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-02-15T17:44:15Z\",\"tags\":[\"POLITICS/Immigration\",\" POLITICS/White House\",\" COUNTRIES/USA\"]}", "prism.aggregationType": "front", "keywords": "immigration policy,immigration reform,border security,Barack Obama,another year,economy,House,Maryland,Obama", "prism.channel": "fnl", "dc.description": "President Barack Obama said during a radio interview that immigration reform will pass before he leaves office in January 2017.", "dc.identifier": "urn:uuid:f118d3655a634410VgnVCM100000d7c1a8c0RCRD", "pagetype": "article", "dc.subject": "immigration policy,immigration reform,border security,Barack Obama,another year,economy,House,Maryland,Obama", "classification-isa": "immigartion, whitehouse", "description": "Motorola Mobility, el fabricante de los tel\u00e9fonos inteligentes de Lenovo, nos est\u00e1 dando pistas sobre el posible relanzamiento de un popular tel\u00e9fono: el ic\u00f3nico Motorola Razr.
