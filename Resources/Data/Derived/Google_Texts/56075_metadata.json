I don\u2019t want people dying on the streets, and I say this all the time. And I say this \u2014 look, I did five speeches, maybe six speeches today. We had a lot of rallies. We had of thousands and thousands of people. I mean, we get big crowds.\u201d\n\nTrump added, \u201cEvery time I talk about this I get standing ovations. The Republican people, they\u2019re wonderful people. They don\u2019t want people dying on the streets. Sometimes they\u2019ll say Donald Trump wants single payer because there\u2019s a group of people \u2014 as good as these plans are and by the way your insurance will go way down, you\u2019ll have better plans, you\u2019ll get your own doctor, which Obama lied.\u201d\n\nWatch:\n\nThe New York billionaire also said that people with pre-existing conditions would still be able to get insurance under his plan and that Obama lied \u201c28 times\u201d that patients could keep their original plan and their doctor under the ACA.\n\n\u201cIf that were in the private sector you\u2019d be sued for fraud, OK? He lied to get the plan through, and it\u2019s turned out to be a disaster,\u201d Trump said. \u201cObamacare is dead. It\u2019s going to be repealed, it\u2019s going to be replaced.\u201d\n\n*Trump tweeted out clarifications of his remarks on the Obamacare mandate late Friday afternoon.\n\nI was asked about healthcare by Anderson Cooper & have been consistent- I will repeal all of #ObamaCare, including the mandate, period. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 19, 2016\n\nI was referring to a backstop for pre-existing conditions. I will eliminate the law, in its entirety, & replace it w/ something much better. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 19, 2016\n\nI will replace it with private plans, health savings accounts, & allow purchasing across state lines.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 19, 2016\n\nI\u2019m self-funding and I am going to take care of the people \u2013 not the special interests and insurance companies like the other candidates. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 19, 2016\n\nRemember, Cruz and Bush gave us Roberts who upheld #ObamaCare twice! I am the only one who will #MAKEAMERICAGREATAGAIN! \u2014 Donald J.
