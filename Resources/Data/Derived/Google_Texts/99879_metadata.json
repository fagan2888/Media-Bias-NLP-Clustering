This put into question the eligibility of other forms of alternative schools that receive state dollars.\n\nFinne said there are many programs under the umbrella of public schools that are controlled by independent, private groups \u201cjust like the charter schools.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe judges did not anticipate this, but there was an immediate outcry in the press and among respected legal scholars here in Washington state saying the court decision is wrong,\u201d Finne said.\n\nShe said the court\u2019s ruling was \u201coutstanding for its mean-spiritedness,\u201d since the decision came directly after many students at charter schools testified Nov. 19 during a committee hearing in the state Senate.\n\n\u201cSummit Public Schools and other charters throughout the state are bringing a vital public school lifeline to underserved communities and students desperate for better opportunities,\u201d Jen Davis Wickens, Summit\u2019s chief regional officer, testified.\n\n\u201cIn our last parent survey, 100 percent of Summit Sierra parents said they would recommend their school to other families. \u2026 Taking this choice away from them is absolutely not fair.\u201d\n\nSummit Sierra in Seattle, along with other charter schools in the state, opened in this past fall.\n\n\u201cI chose this school above other potential schooling options, because I felt like its learning environment was ideal for me,\u201d Kai Worley-Flannell, a student at Summit Sierra High School, testified. \u201cThe traditional school system does not work for every student, and not every student can afford to go to a private school.\u201d\n\nHe went on to say:\n\nWhen I heard the news that charters had been deemed unconstitutional, I was saddened. School for us had been going on for about two weeks, and I had already made a few friends. My grades improved because the way the school teaches worked for me. These public charter schools are revolutionizing the way education happens, and revolutionizing the way our state functions. \u2026 Our schools must stay open, so students like me can continue to flourish.\n\nWashington voters passed a charter school initiative in 2012. Washington became the 42nd state to approve charter schools as an alternative to the regular public schools.\n\n\u201cIt is disappointing that Washington is not following the example of the [41 other] states and the District of Columbia [that] have enacted charter school laws and seen incredible educational gains,\u201d Heritage\u2019s Reim said.\n\nAt the beginning of the 2015-2016 school year, public school teachers went on strike, leaving students home during the first few days of school.\n\n\u201cParents of children in Washington public schools desperately need options, especially in light of the public school teachers\u2019 strike earlier this year that left 53,000 kids out of school,\u201d Reim said. \u201cTeachers at Washington\u2019s charter schools are showing up to work, even though it is unclear if they will get paid and unlikely they will have a job when this school year comes to a close.\u201d\n\nWashington charter schools received state funding for the fall. The decision to eliminate funding is set to go into effect Dec. 14.\n\nThe charter schools have enough money, secured from a private donation, to operate through the current school year, The Daily Signal previously reported.\n\nThe Washington Education Association, the statewide teachers\u2019 union, challenged the charter school law. Now union leaders hope the court\u2019s decision will allow legislators to instead focus on funding for grades K-12 in regular public schools, The News Tribune reported.\n\nAs far as next steps for proponents of charter schools, and their students, the issue is expected to be one of the main issues when the state legislature convenes Jan. 11, Finne said.\n\nRepublicans control the state Senate, while Democrats control the House.\n\n\u201cI have been told by two leading Republicans in the House and in the Senate that there are enough votes, including Democrats in the House, to pass a charter school law,\u201d Finne said.\n\nShe said the speaker of the House would have to allow a vote on such legislation, which eventually would have to survive a potential veto by Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Charter schools in Washington took a hit from the state's top court, leaving roughly 1,300 children and their families wondering what's to next.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Charter schools in Washington took a hit from the state's top court, leaving roughly 1,300 children and their families wondering what's to next.", "title": "State Court Sends Charter Schools Back to the Drawing Board", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151123_WaCharterSchools_Jessen.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-01-26T08:06:58+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1jih9Ci"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Charter schools in Washington took a hit from the state's top court, leaving roughly 1,300 children and their families wondering what's to next.", "title": "State Court Sends Charter Schools Back to the Drawing Board", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151123_WaCharterSchools_Jessen.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Education", "tag": "k-12,school choice", "published_time": "2015-11-25T20:15:03+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-26T08:06:58+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Washington charter schools, Summit Public Schools, Washington Policy Center, Washington supreme court, school choice, education reform"}, "article_summary": "Charter schools in Washington state face an uncertain future, leaving roughly 1,300 children and their families wondering what to do.\nWashington became the 42nd state to approve charter schools as an alternative to the regular public schools.\nAs eight of nine new charter schools in the state navigate their first school year, the Washington Supreme Court upheld a decision that deemed the state\u2019s charter school law unconstitutional.\nThese public charter schools are revolutionizing the way education happens, and revolutionizing the way our state functions.\n\u2026 Taking this choice away from them is absolutely not fair.\u201dSummit Sierra in Seattle, along with other charter schools in the state, opened in this past fall."}
