Researchers are now saying this puts them at risk for eating disorders.\n\nBetween believing that all of our Facebook friends live better lives than us \u2014 their pictures don\u2019t really capture everything \u2014 and getting cheated on through Facebook, it\u2019s no surprise that more and more younger people are ditching it for other social media sites like Twitter and Instagram. Further proving Facebook\u2019s negative effects on the population, a new study \u2014 though not the first of its kind \u2014 finds that women are becoming less happy with their bodies as they spend more time on the site.\n\nThe study looked at the inherent notion that a person, when looking at photos of someone else, will compare that person\u2019s body to their own. A total of 881 college-going women were questioned on their Facebook use over the course of one month, while also being asked how much attention they pay to other people\u2019s photos, specifically with regards to how that person dresses and what their body looks like. They were also asked about their eating habits, how they felt about their own bodies, and where they wanted their weight to be when compared to how much they weighed at the time, HealthDay reported.\n\nThe researchers found that most women wanted to lose about 20 lbs. Whereas the women weighed, on average, about 149 lbs., they wanted to go down to about 130 lbs. Their inclinations to lose weight were linked to not only more time spent on Facebook, but also time spent looking at news feeds and photos, feeling bad about their own bodies, and comparing themselves to others. The researchers said that seeing these photos and feeling inferior to the people in them was a step toward developing eating disorders.\n\n\u201cWomen tend to present their ideal self on Facebook, not necessarily their actual, true self,\u201d said study author Petya Eckler, a lecturer in journalism at the University of Strathclyde in Scotland, according to HealthDay. \u201cFeeling negatively about yourself and increased body comparison is sort of the first step toward disordered eating. Not in everyone, but that\u2019s definitely one of the phases women go through.\u201d\n\nWhile it was unclear whether or not these women realize Facebook photos tend to be glamorized, the influence of someone\u2019s photos on Facebook may be so effective on a person\u2019s psyche because \u201cparticipants in social media are people we know,\u201d Eckler said in a press release. Therefore, the comparisons \u201chit closer to home,\u201d regardless of how unrealistic or edited they may be.\n\nThe study didn\u2019t prove a cause-and-effect relationship, and although the women didn\u2019t show symptoms of eating disorders, their eating patterns were affected by the photos they saw. According to the National Association of Anorexia and Associated Disorders (ANAD), more than half of teenage girls and almost a third of boys manage their weight in ways that are more harmful than anything. These included skipping meal, fasting, smoking cigarettes, vomiting, and taking laxatives. Among 185 college girls surveyed 58 percent said that they felt pressured to be a certain weight.\n\nConsidering that eating disorders have the highest mortality rate of any mental illness, according to ANAD, it would benefit parents and loved ones to notice signs of an eating disorder \u2014 though it\u2019s not always easy. These include a preoccupation with food, an \u201cunrelenting\u201d fear of gaining weight, excessively thin facial or body hair, abnormal weight loss, sensitivity to cold, quickly consuming a lot of food, refusal to eat, lack of menstruation, and a self-esteem that\u2019s easily influenced when someone mentions their body image.\n\nEckler\u2019s findings were presented this week at the annual conference of the International Communication Association in Seattle.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "eating disorders and women, facebook and eating disorders, women see pictures of facebook, facebook and weight, facebook photos", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Women who spent more time on Facebook looking at friends' photos were more likely to have problems with their own body image as they compared their friends' bodies to their own.
