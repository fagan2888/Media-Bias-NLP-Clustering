The largely Sunni-Muslim city in the north is a strategic hub for Iraq\u2019s oil industry, as well as a gateway to Syria.\n\nThe militants, also known as ISIS, or ISIL, captured military depots, equipment and weapons in Mosul. They also seized provincial government headquarters and freed more than 1,000 prisoners. Thousands of residents fled north toward the Kurdish autonomous region, jamming roads. Some were Iraqi soldiers, who left their uniforms in the streets.\n\nIn Baghdad, newly-reelected Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki addressed the most serious challenge yet in his eight-year tenure.\n\nNOURI AL-MALIKI, Prime Minister, Iraq (through interpreter): I call upon the parliament to live up to its responsibility to declare a state of emergency and general mobilization. We have to declare a comprehensive mobilization and the highest alert in political, financial and popular capabilities to defeat terrorism and bring life to normal in all areas occupied by terrorists, either in Mosul or any other city.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: But Maliki\u2019s Shiite-led government has largely failed in reconciling with Iraq\u2019s Sunni population. The Islamic State has taken advantage of the breach. The Sunni extremist group previously took over Fallujah and parts of Ramadi in western and central Iraq.\n\nIt\u2019s also a principal combatant in Syria\u2019s civil war, but has fought against other rebel groups as fiercely as many of its units have fought against the army of President Assad. The group\u2019s ambitions there have led to a rupture with al-Qaida\u2019s core organization, which sides with the Syrian rebellion.\n\nThe attack on Mosul now threatens to draw nearby Kurdish forces into the fighting as well.\n\nThat drew this reaction from the U.S. State Department today.\n\nJEN PSAKI, State Department Press Secretary: The threat ISIL is presenting is not just threat to Iraq or the stability of Iraq, but it is a threat to the region. And this growing menace exemplifies the importance of Iraqis from all communities working together to confront this common enemy.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Iraq\u2019s parliament has announced it will meet Thursday to decide on a state of emergency.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sunni militants pushed Iraqi army units from parts of Iraq\u2019s second largest city, Mosul, after days of fighting.
