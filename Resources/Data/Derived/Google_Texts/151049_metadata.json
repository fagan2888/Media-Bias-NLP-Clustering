Republican primary, according to polls. U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, who angered some in his own party by shutting down the federal government in a failed attempt to stop the Affordable Care Act, stands second.\n\nThe two insurgents won the GOP\u2019s first two races in Iowa and New Hampshire.\n\nA GOP establishment candidate has not placed better than third in S.C. poll averages. But U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida is hoping to punch his primary ticket out of the state.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at the primary that likely will narrow the Republican field to four candidates.\n\nWhat\u2019s at stake?\n\nDonald Trump: A win could propel the New York billionaire toward the GOP nomination. He remains ahead in national polls but his S.C. lead is narrowing, according to one poll released this week. Anything less than a victory in the Palmetto State would be disappointing to Trump, who has led in S.C. polls since the summer. If Trump falters, blame will be placed on his critical comments during last Saturday\u2019s debate about former President George W. Bush\u2019s role in the 9/11 attacks and his off-color language.\n\nTed Cruz: The U.S. senator from Texas needs to finish second in South Carolina, a state with a large bloc of evangelical voters, his main base of his support. Cruz won in Iowa, a state where a majority of GOP voters are evangelicals. And he has one of the best ground games in South Carolina A third-place finish will be blamed on voters thinking his campaign has played dirty tricks.\n\nMarco Rubio: The U.S. senator from Florida wants to come out of South Carolina as the candidate of the GOP establishment. He has a chance with S.C. Gov. Nikki Haley\u2019s recent endorsement and rising poll numbers, some of which show him challenging Cruz for second. A poor finish could be a sign that voters are worried about his lack of experience.\n\nJohn Kasich: The Ohio governor made strong gains in South Carolina after a finishing second in New Hampshire. But the Republican race\u2019s more moderate candidate was starting from the back of the pack in South Carolina. Kasich could come in fourth, which would be good enough to keep going to March primaries in Ohio and Michigan, more favorable Midwestern ground.\n\nJeb Bush: The former Florida governor needs to beat expectations and finish third to remain in the race. Bush invested a great deal in the state, where his father and brother won en route to the White House. Bush and his allied super PAC have spent the most on ads, and his brother, a former president, and mother, a former first lady, campaigned for him.\n\nBen Carson: The retired neurosurgeon is polling last in South Carolina, just months after challenging Trump for the lead in the GOP race. Like Bush, a top-three finish realistically is a must to keep going. Carson, who said Friday he would not quit the race, has S.C. support, having raised the most money among active Republican candidates from donors in the state last year.\n\nKeys\n\nTrump has the backing of a board base of voters \u2014 from moderates to evangelicals \u2014 and is looking to win support across the state.\n\nCruz wants a strong showing in the Upstate and Pee Dee, areas where social conservative candidates, Mike Huckabee in 2008 and Rick Santorum in 2012, fared well.\n\nRubio could use help from Charleston and Hilton Head, coastal areas where GOP establishment candidates can perform better.\n\nKasich and Bush will look for support from the coast to the military-heavy Midlands.\n\nCarson, like Cruz, needs a boost from Upstate evangelicals.\n\nTop S.C. endorsements\n\nTrump received the endorsement of Lt. Gov. Henry McMaster.\n\nRubio has endorsements from Haley, U.S. Sen. Tim Scott of North Charleston and U.S. Rep. Trey Gowdy of Spartanburg.\n\nBush has the support of U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham.\n\nCruz has the backing of U.S. Reps. Jeff Duncan of Laurens and Mark Sanford of Charleston.\n\nRecent S.C GOP primary history\n\nThe last time the White House was open was in 2008, when U.S. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., beat former Gov. Mike Huckabee, R-Ark., by less than 4 percentage points in South Carolina.\n\nIn the 2012 race to face Democrat President Barack Obama, South Carolina\u2019s three decade-long streak of choosing the eventual GOP presidential nominee was snapped. Former U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich soundly defeated former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, who went on to win the GOP nomination.\n\nTurnout\n\nRecord turnout is expected.\n\nThe large GOP field and interest generated by Trump are credited with producing high turnouts in the Iowa and New Hampshire GOP races earlier this month.\n\nBut the number of South Carolinians voting Saturday will dwarf those states. In 2012, for instance, 603,856 voters went to the polls for the S.C. GOP primary, 61 percent more than the combined voted in Iowa and New Hampshire that year.\n\nBallot\n\nThe ballot will have 12 names, but just six candidates remain active \u2014 Bush, Carson, Cruz, Kasich, Rubio and Trump.\n\nThe six who have dropped out but will appear on the ballot are: Chris Christie, Carly Fiorina, Jim Gilmore, Mike Huckabee, Rand Paul and Rick Santorum.\n\nS.C. GOP polls\n\nAverage of polls from Sunday through Froday, according to Real Clear Politics\n\nDonald Trump: 31.8%\n\nTed Cruz: 18.4%\n\nMarco Rubio: 17.8%\n\nJeb Bush: 10.3%\n\nJohn Kasich: 9.5%\n\nBen Carson: 6.9%\n\nWhat\u2019s at stake in the S.C. primary?\n\n\u2014 50 delegates to the Republican Convention that will nominate the GOP candidate for president\n\n\u2014 The top-finisher statewide will get 29 delegates\n\n\u2014 Also, the top-finisher in each South Carolina congressional district \u2014 there are seven \u2014 will get three delegates\n\n\u2014 After Iowa and New Hampshire, Donald Trump is leading the delegate count \u2014 at 17.
