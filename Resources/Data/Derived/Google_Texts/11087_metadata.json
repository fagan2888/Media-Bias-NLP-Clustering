Patients reported thier experiences to the website Vitals.com. New Hampshire patients have the shortest average wait time at just 15 minutes and four seconds.\n\nOverall, wait times decreased compared to last year. The national average was down by more than a minute by comparison. The average wait time in Alabama decreased by almost a minute compared to last year.\n\nThat comes as a surprise for experts who predicted longer wait times and more crowded waiting rooms in the first year of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nReasons for the decrease could include increased use of urgent care and retail clinics. Physician assistants and nurse practitioners could also be taking the load off primary care doctors, said Vitals.com founder Mitch Rothschild.\n\n\"If you look at the number of urgent care centers, I guarantee you there are probably twenty-five percent more than there were a few years ago.\"\n\nThe differences in wait times between states and cities might boil down to the number of medical providers, Rothschild said. Sixty of the state's 67 counties are classified as having a shortage of primary care physicians, according to the Alabama Rural Health Association.\n\n\"Probably the doctor-patient ratio is the main reason,\" Rothschild said.\n\nThe amount of time patients wait for doctors depends on more than just geography. Different specialties have different average wait times. Unfortunately for those who dread the drill, dentists have the shortest wait time at 13 minutes and 31 seconds. Pain specialists have the most agonizing wait at 24 minutes and 52 seconds.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "news", "title": "Alabama patients have the nation's longest average wait for doctors", "og": {"site_name": "AL.com", "description": "Alabama patients spend the longest stretches in the waiting room in the country, according to a recent report from Vitals.
