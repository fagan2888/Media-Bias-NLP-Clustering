But they cut out the part of the video where the very same cop beat the man to a pulp.\n\nLast year, Greater Boston\u2019s Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority Transit Police released video of what seemed to be a \u201chero cop.\u201d The officer saved the life of a man who almost fell (or apparently jumped), onto the tracks in front of a subway train.\n\nBut now, a full-length version of the previously-edited video, has revealed much more to the story.\n\nAn investigation by local 5 news has proven that the police deliberately edited the video to highlight the actions of the officer which would make him look heroic. But they cut out the part of the video where the very same cop beat the man to a pulp.\n\n\n\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsor\n\nThe MBTA video clearly shows Detective Sean Conway grabbing a man who was about to go over the edge of the subway platform.\n\nChief Paul MacMillan praised Conway at the time, calling him a hero.\n\n\u201cHe was alert, he saw what was going to happen and he took appropriate action, so we\u2019re very proud of him,\u201d MacMillan said last spring.\n\nWatch the short, edited version and you will see an apparently drunk Anthony Ferrier being saved by the officer.\n\nBut after the video ends, you see Detective Conway punching Ferrier in the face repeatedly. Ferrier\u2019s lawyer released a photo (above), that shows severe facial injuries the man sustained at the hands of the supposedly \u201cheroic\u201d cop.\n\n\u201cThe MBTA misled the public and clearly intended to do so,\u201d David Milton, Ferrier\u2019s lawyer said. \u201cIf they truly believe the officer\u2019s actions were appropriate beginning to end, they should have released the entire video and let the public decide.\u201d\n\nThe MBTA didn\u2019t release the video at first. It took eight months and a lawsuit to get them to finally hand it over.\n\nThe MBTA released a statement stating their belief that \u201cDetective Conway\u2019s use of force was justified and commensurate for the situation.\u201d\n\nThey added that \u201cConway was in compliance with policy.\u201d\n\n\u201cProperly trained police officers do not punch people in the face,\u201d Ferrier\u2019s lawyer said. \u201cProperly trained police officers receive extensive training in subduing suspects.\u201d\n\nWatch the local WCVB 5 report below and help us SPREAD THE WORD!", "article_metadata": {"description": "Last year, Greater Boston\u2019s Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority Transit Police released video of what seemed to be a \u201chero cop.\u201d The officer saved the life of a man who almost fell (or apparently jumped), onto the tracks in front of a subway train.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "M.
