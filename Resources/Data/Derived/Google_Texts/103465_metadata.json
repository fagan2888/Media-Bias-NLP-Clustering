Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, took on President Barack Obama\u2019s foreign policy strategy, arguing that the country needs to elect a new leader who is willing to confront the \u201creal and dangerous threats\u201d facing the nation.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve all got to come together and find conservative leadership that will confront the very real and dangerous threats America faces in this world,\u201d Ernst said at the Conservative Political Action Conference, or CPAC, outside Washington, D.C. \u201cThe reality is, the world is in turmoil, and President Obama does not want to face that fact.\u201d\n\nCriticizing Obama for once referring to the Islamic State\u2014also known as ISIS\u2014as a \u201cJV\u201d team, Ernst, who served in the military for more than 23 years, stressed the urgency for new leadership.\n\n\u201cThe San Bernardino attacks proved this is not just some JV force in the Middle East,\u201d she said. \u201cISIS is present in all 50 states, according to the FBI. Think about that for a moment.\u201d\n\nErnst sits on the Senate Armed Services Committee, which oversees the nation\u2019s military. She is also a member of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.\n\nThe lack of leadership in confronting ISIS, Ernst said, is not just hurting the homeland. The administration\u2019s \u201cinability to stand tall and destroy ISIS\u201d is bleeding into other sectors of the country\u2019s foreign policy, she argued.\n\n\u201cRussia is taking advantage of our lack of leadership in Eastern Europe and the Middle East right now,\u201d Ernst said, adding:\n\nOver the past seven years, the Obama-Clinton foreign policy strategy has been to give ground to Vladimir Putin from Ukraine to Syria, [and] to retreat from making tough choices in the defense of American interest in our national security.\n\nRallying young conservatives in the room, Ernst said the time is now to elect new leadership.\n\n\u201cWe need to make this happen,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need a conservative who will help our allies and protect our national security.\u201d\n\nRunning through Saturday, CPAC offers conservatives across the country an opportunity to gather with fellow activists and leaders for speeches, panels, exhibits, and other activities at Gaylord National Resort and Convention Center at Maryland\u2019s National Harbor.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sen.
