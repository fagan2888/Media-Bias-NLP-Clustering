He lost his left arm and left leg above his knee. His jaw needed to be reconstructed, and his mouth was wired shut.\n\nLoading View on Instagram\n\n\n\nAccording to TODAY, his life immediately changed \u2014 and not for the better:\n\nA soldier who had been dedicated to fitness since he was a teenager, Galloway gained weight and spent hours every day laying in bed after returning home from the hospital, consumed by depression and alcohol. In 2010, a look in the mirror jolted him into turning his life around, and he dedicated himself to getting back in shape.\n\n>>> READ MORE: Life After War\n\nNow Galloway spends his days running, climbing, weight-lifting and training for races. His journey back to fitness and inspiration started during late nights at a 24-hour gym where he would adjust different machines so he could use them with his missing limbs. He\u2019s finished multiple marathons, seven Tough Mudder events and 12 Spartan Races.\n\nLoading Team @QuestNutrition had some fun this past weekend at the Georgia #spartanrace. View on Instagram\n\n\u201cWhat kept me moving was never going back to where I came from,\u201d he told Men\u2019s Health. \u201cI wanted people to see more than my injury.\u201d\n\nLoading Me during the second WOD at the @CrossFit competition #GarageGames1 in GA View on Instagram\n\n\n\nGalloway is passionate about leading other veterans to recovery, before they hit the low point he did during his own recovery. His involvement in the nonprofit, Team X-T.R.E.M.E., gave him the opportunity to participate in physically demanding races wearing gas masks to raise money to take injured veterans on morale-boosting trips.\n\nLoading Right before jumping out of the plane to the start line of the Heroes heat at the Leesburg #SpartanRace last summer racing with #TeamXtreme View on Instagram\n\n\n\n\u201cIf I can show them the route I took to success,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cThen they can follow the same, and that makes me feel good.\u201d His other motivation for success: his three children.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m showing my two sons and my daughter that no matter what happens to you in life, you can continue pushing. You can continue to be happy and do whatever you want to do. I feel like I\u2019m showing them what they need to do, because as a parent, you can try to preach to your children all day long. They don\u2019t hear your words. They only see your actions. And I hope that I\u2019m showing them a healthy, happy way of leading their life.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "He overcame drinking, depression to become incredible athlete", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "He overcame drinking, depression to become incredible athlete", "title": "This Amputee Veteran's Inspiring Story", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/2D274906951147-today-veteran-mens-health-141007-01.blocks_desktop_medium1.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-10-07T16:12:31+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1xmvFLz"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "He overcame drinking, depression to become incredible athlete", "title": "This Amputee Veteran's Inspiring Story", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/2D274906951147-today-veteran-mens-health-141007-01.blocks_desktop_medium1.jpg"}, "creator": "@kelsrenhar", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Security", "tag": "veterans", "published_time": "2014-10-07T16:10:46+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-07T16:12:31+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "men's health, noah galloway,"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3567\"", "article_summary": "View on Instagram\u201cWhat kept me moving was never going back to where I came from,\u201d he told Men\u2019s Health.\nLoading #Bataan View on InstagramThe 32-year-old father of three is the \u201c2014 Ultimate Men\u2019s Health Guy\u201d and will adorn newsstands across the nation this month with his November cover in Men\u2019s Health magazine.\nHis involvement in the nonprofit, Team X-T.R.E.M.E., gave him the opportunity to participate in physically demanding races wearing gas masks to raise money to take injured veterans on morale-boosting trips.\n\u201cThen they can follow the same, and that makes me feel good.\u201d His other motivation for success: his three children.\n\u201cI\u2019m showing my two sons and my daughter that no matter what happens to you in life, you can continue pushing."}
