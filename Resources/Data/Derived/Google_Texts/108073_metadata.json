For instance, only 1 of 10 Americans are aware the Stimulus gave middle class workers an almost secret tax cut when the economy needed it the most, and the massive deficit savings could add decades to the life of Medicare. Obama\u2019s accomplishments \u2014 beyond preventing a greater depression, insuring 17 million and leading us into the Obamaboom, our longest private-sector job expansion ever \u2014 are complex, purposely subtle, and almost impossible to convey in a 30-second ad.\n\nAs soon as he took office, Obama refused to be the president who just prevented a greater depression.\n\n\u201cHe wanted to do stuff, not just avoid stuff,\u201d Grunwald writes. \u201cHe wanted to be a Ronald Reagan of the left.\u201d\n\nTo do this he committed his advisors to focus on policies that worked and told them to leave the politics to him. This approach has enabled him to enact the kind of change that has tilted government back toward advocating for people in a way comparable to the way Reagan shifted the scales towards the rich and their favorite people \u2014 corporations . While no one thing he\u2019s enacted has been as paradigm-shifting as lowering the top tax rate from 70 to 28 percent, or the creation of Medicare and Medicaid, the sum of his feats may end up as equally revolutionary \u2014 and possibly could even end up saving the planet from the worst of the climate crisis.\n\nOn the other hand, Obama\u2019s failure to sell his accomplishments could end up costing him much of his legacy, should a Republican sweep into office determined to uninsure millions, unleash Wall Street\u2019s most destructive instincts, and supersize carbon pollution.\n\nThe historic nature of Obama\u2019s presidency and even his election are now so politicized that attempting to explicate them risks seeming oblivious to the real economic troubles that still vex us, or alienating liberals who despise incrementalism, or feeding the angst of the hard right that takes even his existence as an insult.\n\nBut if there\u2019s ever a time to stop and appreciate the singular presidency we\u2019re all living through, it\u2019s now. Here are five hidden successes that Mike Grunwald has revealed.\n\n1. Kicking the big banks out of the student loan business.\n\nThis first success is the most forgotten because it was buried in the same bill that gave us the Affordable Care Act. By taking over the student loan program and kicking out Sallie Mae and other private lenders who raked in enormous fees without the risk such loans usually entail, it was the only \u201cgovernment takeover\u201d Obama actually signed into law. \u201cThe bill then diverted the budget savings into a $36 billion expansion of Pell Grants for low-income undergraduates, plus an unheralded but extraordinary student-debt relief effort that is now quietly transferring the burden of college loans from struggling borrowers to taxpayers,\u201d Grunwald writes.\n\n2. Shrinking health care cost inflation and saving us billions.\n\nA big complaint from from the left during the passage of the Affordable Care Act was that the law doesn\u2019t regulate the health industry sufficiently to contain costs. Industry profits and insurance offerings were closely regulated \u2014 eliminating, for instance, co-pays for \u201cquit-smoking programs, birth control pills, certain cancer screenings and other preventive care\u201d \u2014 but the bill leaned more on trying to control the growth of health care spending by including \u201cevery cost-control idea in circulation.\u201d Yet the result has been better than the law\u2019s proponents expected. \u201cHealth care is still getting more expensive, but since 2010, the growth rate has slowed so drastically that the Congressional Budget Office has slashed its projection for government health spending in 2020 by $175 billion,\u201d Grunwald writes. \u201cThat\u2019s enough to fund the Navy for a year, or the EPA for two decades.\u201d This is the kind of reform that makes traditional Medicare sustainable, which is exactly why Republicans in Congress just voted to repeal it again.\n\n3. Taking on two of our leading causes of preventable death.\n\nYou probably know about the Administration\u2019s efforts \u2014 led by the First Lady \u2014 to take on childhood obesity directly with school lunches and more indirectly by trying to create a culture of nutrition and exercise. But one major victory the Obama Administration scored in a decades-long effort to prioritize health over profits was the FDA taking over the regulation of the tobacco industry. \u201cI remember President Bill Clinton crusading for the Food and Drug Administration to regulate tobacco, but I somehow missed that Obama finally made it happen,\u201d Grunwald writes.\n\n4. Clamping down on too-big-to-fail banks and putting government to work for consumers.\n\nJust as many on the left will forever compare Obamacare unfavorably to single-payer, many wanted to see the big banks broken up. Instead, the president went with policies that are almost impossible to explain without drool-inducing PowerPoints but have achieved many of the goals that progressives hoped to see from reform. Grunwald says that \u201cthe bottom line is that financial behemoths no longer enjoy much of a \u2018too-big-to-fail subsidy.'\u201d But even more importantly, there is now an independent government agency designed to protect the borrowers who suffered the most during the financial crisis. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Grunwald writes, \u201cis most influential new regulatory agency since the EPA, already collecting more than $10 billion in fines from financial players that used to enjoy relative impunity.\u201d And guess what would be one of the very first thing Republicans would eliminate.\n\n5. Transforming the way we produce energy.\n\nThere\u2019s no issue that divides the two political parties more than the need to fight climate change: One wants to reduce carbon pollution while the other wants to increase it. For seven years, Obama has driven us toward reduction. First, there was the Stimulus, which \u201ctransformed the U.S. clean-energy sector, blasting an astonishing $90 billion into renewables and other long-neglected green priorities, while birthing a new research agency called ARPA-E.\u201d Then through regulation where with just one rule he\u2019s backed, \u201cfor commercial air conditioners, will singlehandedly reduce U.S. energy use by 1 percent.\u201d By thrusting us to the point that renewables can compete with its dirtier alternatives on cost alone, this most important advancement of the Obama era may be one change that may irreversible. But be assured, that any Republican president would do his best to set us back on highway to climate catastrophe.\n\nU.S. President Barack Obama smiles as he holds his end of the year news conference at the White House in Washington December 18, 2015.
