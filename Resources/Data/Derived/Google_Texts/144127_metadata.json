And distraction has been academically shown to increase the danger of prescription errors.\u201d\n\nIn this new format, pharmacists will be monitoring prescriptions and staff remotely via computer screens. The group says in its complaint to the state health department that this not only presents privacy issues for consumers, but it also violates Florida statute requiring direct pharmacist supervision of pharmacy staff.\n\nWalgreens spokesman Michael Pozin said in a statement that the stores\u2019 new format allows pharmacists to \u201cpractice at the top of their profession, consistent with state Pharmacy Practice Acts, and offers a broad range of needed health care services to local communities.\u201d\n\nThe statement also said Walgreens worked closely with each state Board of Pharmacy to review the new model.", "article_metadata": {"category": "HNF Stories", "description": "A consumer and labor watchdog has filed a complaint with Florida\u2019s Department of Health, targeting the way Walgreens pharmacists talk to customers.
