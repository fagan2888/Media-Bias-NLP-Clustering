SYRACUSE, N.Y. -- Dentists in New York state are treating more children on Medicaid, but fewer children and adults with private dental insurance, according to a report.

The percentage of children on Medicaid who had at least one annual dental visit increased in New York from 32 percent in 2005 to 43 percent in 2013, the report by the American Dental Association shows.

Medicaid is the government health insurance program for the poor.

The report says there has been a substantial gain in access to dental care among children on Medicaid nationwide.

But dentists are seeing fewer privately-insured patients.

The percentage of privately-insured children in New York who had at least one annual dental visit declined from 65 percent in 2005 to 62 percent 2013. Meanwhile, the percentage of privately-insured adult New Yorkers who went to the dentist dipped from 61 percent to 58 percent.

Cost is the top reason people avoid dentists, according to the report. Between 2003 and 2013 average dental charges in New York rose 5.4 percent for children and 3.8 percent for adults.

The report says the federal Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, has not helped matters because it does not require insurers to cover adult dental care.

In New York, 38 percent of dentists accept children on Medicaid. The payment rates dentists get for treating them dropped nearly 34 percent between 2003 and 2013, according to the report.
