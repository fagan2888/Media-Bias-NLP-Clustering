In the wake of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s enactment in 2010, conservative lawmakers lambasted the contraceptive move as a serious affront to devout business owners in their districts.\n\nDozens of businesses sued, saying they run their companies in line with deeply held beliefs and that they particularly object to insuring morning-after pills, which they equate with abortion. They said that if the mandate stood, their firms would have to choose between violating their faith or dropping health care coverage for their employees.\n\nThe 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver eventually said Hobby Lobby \u2014 a family-owned chain of craft stores based in Oklahoma \u2014 had a legitimate case against the administrative mandate. Some circuit courts agreed, but others didn\u2019t.\n\nIn November, the Supreme Court said it would consider challenges from Hobby Lobby and Conestoga Wood Specialties, a Pennsylvania-based firm whose Mennonite owners did not win their challenge at the circuit court level.\n\nIt is difficult to assess each justice\u2019s position on the question because it \u201creally hasn\u2019t come before the court before,\u201d said Randy Barnett, a professor at the Georgetown Law Center.\n\nInstead, it may be useful to look at how the high court has applied a key law aimed at protecting religious liberties, or other legal precedents at play.\n\nClues in case law?\n\nAnalysts pointed to a pair of Supreme Court decisions that came down before and after Congress passed the Religious Freedom and Restoration Act, a 1993 law aimed at preventing burdens on the right to exercise religious beliefs.\n\nCongress passed the legislation, which figures prominently in lawsuits against the contraception mandate, in part as a response to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Employment Division v. Smith. In that case, the state of Oregon refused to provide unemployment benefits to American Indians who were fired from a rehabilitation clinic after testing positive for the key ingredient in peyote.\n\nJustice Antonin Scalia, a devout Catholic with a conservative record, wrote the Smith opinion that effectively limited Americans\u2019 ability to cite their religious beliefs in seeking exemption from valid laws. Otherwise, Justice Scalia wrote at the time, it \u201cwould open the prospect of constitutionally required religious exemptions from civic obligations of almost every conceivable kind.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe criticism he got from the religious community on that was huge,\u201d Mr. Burrus said.\n\nAfter enactment of the Religious Freedom and Restoration Act, the court used the law in 2006 to uphold the religious freedoms of a New Mexico church whose sacramental tea had been seized by federal agents because it contained an illegal hallucinogen.\n\nMr. Barnett noted that Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., a member of the court\u2019s conservative wing, was aggressive in applying the act in the case Gonzales v. O Centro Espirita Beneficente Uniao do Vegetal, even if members of the conservative wing are not inclined to be lenient about drug use in general.\n\nFree-speech questions\n\nThere also is a free-speech component to the case. The 10th Circuit judges who sided with Hobby Lobby cited the landmark Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission case of 2010, which held that corporations hold free-speech rights that entitle them to make independent political expenditures.\n\n\u201cThe idea that people don\u2019t lose their rights when they organize in a corporate form is common to both situations,\u201d Mr. Barnett said.\n\nDespite conventional wisdom that breaks the court into liberal and conservative wings and a swing vote \u2014 often Justice Anthony M. Kennedy \u2014 it is difficult to say which justices might uphold a business\u2019 right to religious freedom, the analysts said.\n\nMr. Burrus said Justice Stephen G. Breyer, who is typically associated with the court\u2019s liberal wing, is partial to judicial balancing tests, or measuring various interests against each other, or striking a balance between competing interests. The Obama administration has been giving out exemptions to the health care law as it grapples with the high number of people who lost existing health care plans that did not meet Obamacare\u2019s coverage requirements.\n\nThe administration also issued an accommodation for nonprofit employers who object to the contraception mandate, so it may be difficult for the government to argue that it is impossible for them to carve out an exception for the for-profit companies.", "article_metadata": {"description": "When the Supreme Court next year decides whether the Obama administration can force for-profit companies to insure birth control, the punditry around abortion or the \"war on women\" will be overshadowed by legal precedent and acts by Congress that weigh religious liberty against government mandates, legal scholars say.", "Author": "Tom Howell Jr.", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "When the Supreme Court next year decides whether the Obama administration can force for-profit companies to insure birth control, the punditry around abortion or the \u201cwar on women\u201d will be overshadowed by legal precedent and acts by Congress that weigh religious liberty against government mandates, legal scholars say.", "title": "Supreme Court position on Obamacare birth control mandate a tough call", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/dec/25/supreme-court-position-on-obamacare-birth-control-/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/12/25/12252013_ap652395232838201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/12/25/12252013_ap652395232838201.jpg", "title": "Supreme Court position on Obamacare birth control mandate a tough call", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "description": "When the Supreme Court next year decides whether the Obama administration can force for-profit companies to insure birth control, the punditry around abortion or the \"war on women\" will be overshadowe"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Law Crime, Religion Belief, Politics, Trevor Burrus, Supreme Court"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8088\"", "article_summary": "The Obama administration has been giving out exemptions to the health care law as it grapples with the high number of people who lost existing health care plans that did not meet Obamacare\u2019s coverage requirements.\nIn November, the Supreme Court said it would consider challenges from Hobby Lobby and Conestoga Wood Specialties, a Pennsylvania-based firm whose Mennonite owners did not win their challenge at the circuit court level.\nThey said that if the mandate stood, their firms would have to choose between violating their faith or dropping health care coverage for their employees.\nCongress passed the legislation, which figures prominently in lawsuits against the contraception mandate, in part as a response to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Employment Division v.
