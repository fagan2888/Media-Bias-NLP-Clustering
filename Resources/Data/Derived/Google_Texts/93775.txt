The Riverside Co. is purchasing textile distributor Momentum Group from Norwest Equity Partners. Momentum, based in Irvine, California, designs textiles for offices along with the heath care and hospitality sectors.

“Momentum has performed exceptionally well for many years and has developed a truly unique and differentiated business model driven by continuous improvement and enabled by technology,” says Norwest principal Andrew Cantwell. Financial terms of the deal, which closed on April 1, we’re not disclosed. Norwest invested in Momentum in 2011. BlackArch Partners and Faegre Baker Daniels are advising Norwest.
