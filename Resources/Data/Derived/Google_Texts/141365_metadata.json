Gabrielle Giffords, the NRA targeted a pair of Brooklyn lawmakers Monday with a menacing image of bullets next to photos of the two gun control advocates.\n\nAmerica\u2019s 1st Freedom, an NRA publication, tweeted the image of state Sen. Roxanne Persaud and Assemblywoman Jo Anne Simon, both Democrats, weeks after they announced legislation aimed at controlling the sale of ammunition.\n\nLUPICA: OBAMA'S BIG MOMENT AS HE TAKES ON GUN LOBBY\n\nThe two lawmakers and other local supporters \u2014 including Mayor de Blasio and Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams \u2014 condemned what came across as a veiled threat.\n\nA National Rifle Association publication showed the organization's opposition to an ammunition limit bill with this tweet Monday morning. (@NRAA1F via Twitter)\n\n\u201cI think it is irresponsible in the times that we are living in to place a target around someone,\u201d Persaud told the Daily News. \u201cBy placing someone\u2019s picture with bullets next to them you are playing on the fears of people.\u201d\n\nEDITORIAL: DANGEROUS FIGHTING WORDS ON GUNS AND GUN CONTROL\n\nPersaud said the picture has \u201cthe potential to cause harm\u201d because you don\u2019t know if a psycho who is upset about the proposal will react to something like that.\n\nSimon agreed the photo was \u201cirresponsible\u201d and simply an attempt by the NRA to intimidate her and stir up its gun-loving base.\n\n\u201cThey are clearly trying to be intimidating and it is not working,\u201d Simon said.\n\nThe organization showed its staunch opposition in a blog post to a bill the lawmakers announced last month limiting ammunition purchases over a 90-day period.\n\nNRA REACTS TO NEW YORK AMMO LIMIT BILL BY TRYING TO BULLY THOSE SEEKING GUN LAWS\n\nDemocrat State Sen. Roxanne Persaud of Brooklyn is one of two lawmakers who announced the gun control bill last month. (nysenate.gov)\n\n\u201cIn truth, such legislation should simply be laughed off and quickly forgotten,\u201d America\u2019s 1st Freedom editor Mark Chesnut wrote.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, the anti-gun climate in New York requires that we all take it seriously. New York gun owners should make sure their representatives know how strongly they oppose this ridiculous assault on their rights.\u201d\n\nEXCLUSIVE: MOM OF MURDERED TEEN ZAEVION DOBSON PRAISES OBAMA\n\nA picture that was part of the tweet showed snapshots of the legislators surrounded by four bullets.\n\nSimon and Persaud said they have received threatening emails and tweets since they unveiled plans for the bill on Dec. 20 with Adams.\n\nDemocratic state Assemblywoman Jo Anne Simon, shown in a February 2015 file photo, announced proposed new limits on ammo purchases with state Sen. Persaud. (Theodore Parisienne/for New York Daily News)\n\nDe Blasio and Adams rushed to their defense.\n\n\u201cKnock it off,\u201d de Blasio tweeted. \u201cYour graphic is obnoxious and suggestive.\u201d\n\nAdams tweeted that the NRA \u201cis shamefully attacking compassionate efforts\u201d to reduce gun violence.\n\nBARACK OBAMA WILL REVEAL EXECUTIVE ACTIONS ON GUN CONTROL TUESDAY\n\nThe borough president had proposed the idea of ammo restrictions to the two state lawmakers.\n\n\u201cThe bills that we have drafted are intended to be a conversation starter, which will result in the right common-sense solution for New York,\u201d Adams said in a statement. \u201cWe cannot be deterred by the level of hateful rhetoric that extremists are engaging in behind the cover of social media, which has already sparked a number of dangerous threats.\u201d\n\nThis is truly disturbing! I hope the NRA is responsible enough to remove this tweet. https://t.co/hB8fznXwEo \u2014 Jo Anne Simon (@JoAnneSimonBK52) January 4, 2016\n\nKnock it off, @NRAA1F. Your graphic is obnoxious and suggestive. I stand with @joannesimonbk52 & @senatorpersaud. https://t.co/eD0iMtmL6a \u2014 Bill de Blasio (@BilldeBlasio) January 4, 2016\n\n.@NRAA1F we will not cower to your scare tactics. Proud to stand with @joannesimonbk52 & @SenatorPersaud https://t.co/4zpvcqisSc \u2014 Scott M. Stringer (@scottmstringer) January 4, 2016\n\nCity Controller Scott Stringer tweeted, \u201cWe will not cower to your scare tactics.\u201d\n\nAn NRA spokesman did not reply to an email seeking comment.\n\nRepresentatives for Twitter also didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request to know whether the tweet violates the company\u2019s policy against threatening posts. Company executives have declined to comment on specific Twitter accounts in the past.\n\nSimon called the legislation an \u201canti-stockpiling bill\u201d and said the goal is to limit the amount of ammo gun-owners can purchase to no more than twice the capacity of their weapons every 90 days.\n\nFormer Alaska Gov.
