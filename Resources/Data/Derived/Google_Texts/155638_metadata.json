Fu Wengui, nicknamed \u201cgiraffe boy,\u201d has three extra vertebrae in his neck \u2014 a condition known as congenital scoliosis \u2014 causing pain, stress on his nerves, and making it difficult for him to walk. The corrective surgery, sponsored by an undisclosed Beijing charity, will allow Wengui to go out in public again, without the unwanted attention.\n\n\"I hope I can have a normal neck,\" said Wengui, the NY Daily News reported. The extra vertebrae press on his nerves in his neck and make it difficult for him to walk. Currently, Wengui doesn\u2019t like to go out anymore because his condition attracts attention from strangers as he struggles to walk.\n\nAt the age of 6, Wengui was diagnosed with congenital scoliosis and an abnormal chest frame. This spinal deformity occurs very early in development, in the first six weeks of embryonic formation, says the Scoliosis Research Society, and it mostly happens before the mother knows she is pregnant. While it is typically discovered during the infant or toddler period, the condition does not appear until a child\u2019s adolescent years, like in Wengui\u2019s case.\n\nThe Chinese teen is expected to undergo a surgical procedure by doctors in Chaoyang Hospital in Beijing, who are making out a treatment plan. Surgical treatments Wengui may go through include spinal fusion and hemivertebra removal. In spinal fusion, the abnormal curved vertebrae are fused together so that they heal into a single, solid bone. This is able to stop the growth in the abnormal part of the spine, preventing the curve from getting worse. In hemivertebra removal, a single hemivertbra can be surgically removed, and then doctors use metal implants to correct the curve. The procedure will only fuse two to three vertebrae together.\n\nIt remains unknown exactly how much of Wengui\u2019s neck can be removed without causing severe damage. The corrective surgery for the boy\u2019s neck is expected to relieve his condition. Wengui\u2019s dad, Fu Genyou, like his son, hopes to eliminate the public commotion the long neck causes. \u201cHe always causes a stir whenever he goes out,\u201d said Genyou, the Daily Mail reported.\n\nWengui's surgery date is pending on the treatment plan doctors in Beijing are designing for him to shorten his neck.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "chinese boy, chinese teen, ju wengui, giraffe boy, long neck, congenital scoliosis, vertebrae, corrective surgery", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A Chinese teen with congenital scoliosis will undergo corrective surgery on three extra vertebrae for his \u201cgiraffe\u201d neck.", "title": "Teen With 'Giraffe'-Long Neck To Receive Surgery [PHOTO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/giraffe-boy-long-neck-undergo-corrective-surgery-3-extra-vertebrae-what-congenital-300272", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/28/chinese-boy-get-corrective-surgery-super-long-neck.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A Chinese teen with congenital scoliosis will undergo corrective surgery on three extra vertebrae for his \u201cgiraffe\u201d neck.", "title": "Teen With 'Giraffe'-Long Neck To Receive Surgery [PHOTO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/giraffe-boy-long-neck-undergo-corrective-surgery-3-extra-vertebrae-what-congenital-300272", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/28/chinese-boy-get-corrective-surgery-super-long-neck.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/28/chinese-boy-get-corrective-surgery-super-long-neck.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Conditions", "published_time": "2014-08-28T12:05:26-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-28T12:05:25-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A Chinese teen with congenital scoliosis will undergo corrective surgery on three extra vertebrae for his \u201cgiraffe\u201d neck."}, "article_summary": "Wengui's surgery date is pending on the treatment plan doctors in Beijing are designing for him to shorten his neck.\nIt remains unknown exactly how much of Wengui\u2019s neck can be removed without causing severe damage.\nFu Wengui, nicknamed \u201cgiraffe boy,\u201d has three extra vertebrae in his neck \u2014 a condition known as congenital scoliosis \u2014 causing pain, stress on his nerves, and making it difficult for him to walk.\nThe extra vertebrae press on his nerves in his neck and make it difficult for him to walk.\nThe corrective surgery, sponsored by an undisclosed Beijing charity, will allow Wengui to go out in public again, without the unwanted attention."}
