Bill Maher took direct aim at religion on “Real Time” on Friday night, connecting Indiana’s religious freedom law, a horrible anti-gay California ballot initiative and ISIS in one epic piece.

“The root of this problem is that more than half of all Americans still believe the Bible is the actual or inspired word of God,” Maher said, of the Indiana bill. “But now 55 percent also support gay marriage, which must be very confusng.

“On the one hand, God has clearly spelled it out: he hates fags. But you like your gay neighbors Rob and Larry! But the Bible tells you to kill them. Yes, it literally says kill them. What to do?”

Maher was just getting started, as he went after the “Kill the Gays” initiative proposed by a California lawyer named Matt McLaughlin, and urged people to take fundamentalists at their word when they say insane things. Then he pivoted to the Middle East.
