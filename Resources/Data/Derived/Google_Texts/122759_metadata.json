The project will stabilize the tip of the point, will stabilize the harbor side and it will stabilize the east side,\" Campbell said.\n\nThe City of Destin funded the first phase.\n\nBut for phase two the city is hoping for more than $10 million in funds from the Natural Resources Damage Assessment Program.\n\n\"The actual NRDA funding is actually recreational based funding,\" Campbell said.\n\nDestin officials say the NRDA funding is still being processed and won't be available until the fall.\n\nThey hope to begin construction sometime in January, which they say could take a year to complete.", "article_metadata": {"description": "City engineering officials say construction on the popular recreation area will resume in January.
