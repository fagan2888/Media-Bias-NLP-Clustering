(AP) \u2014 A South Dakota city with fewer than 15,000 residents is continuing to establish itself as an international archery powerhouse.\n\nYankton, a Missouri River community in the state\u2019s southeast corner, recently beat out Mexico City (population 8.8 million) in its bid to host the 2015 World Youth Championships. The weeklong event next June will draw some 600 competitors from more than 60 countries to the National Field Archery Association center.\n\nLike many of the archery centers popping up around the U.S., the NFAA Easton Yankton Archery Complex is riding a wave of popularity boosted by a string of bow-friendly Hollywood movies.

And participation at national events has nearly doubled from just shy of 2,400 in 2011 to more than 4,400 in 2013, and USA Archery expects the trend to continue when this year\u2019s numbers are finalized.\n\nOlympic medalist Khatuna Lorig, who is training in Chula Vista, California, for the 2016 Rio de Janeiro summer games, said archery is a terrific family activity.\n\n\u201cThey can shoot and have fun without breaking bones,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a safe sport, and it gives you mental strength, it gives you physical strength and keeps you in shape.\u201d\n\nIn 2012, Lorig spent 15 days training actress Jennifer Lawrence for her role in the blockbuster movie \u201cThe Hunger Games.\u201d The Olympian said she never expected the movie would become such a phenomenon, and the fictional bow-and-arrow-toting heroine Katniss Everdeen helped give archery a certain cachet with kids.", "article_metadata": {"description": "SD archery complex earning international cred", "author": "Dirk Lammers", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "SD archery complex earning international cred", "title": "SD archery complex earning international cred", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/06/29/sd_archery_complex_earning_international_cred/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/archery-complex.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "SD archery complex earning international cred", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/archery-complex.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "title": "SD archery complex earning international cred", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "SD archery complex earning international cred", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc500\"", "article_summary": "Like many of the archery centers popping up around the U.S., the NFAA Easton Yankton Archery Complex is riding a wave of popularity boosted by a string of bow-friendly Hollywood movies.\n(AP) \u2014 A South Dakota city with fewer than 15,000 residents is continuing to establish itself as an international archery powerhouse.\nIndividual memberships to USA Archery, the sport\u2019s governing body in the country, have jumped from about 4,700 in 2011 to nearly 13,000 as of May 31.\nThe weeklong event next June will draw some 600 competitors from more than 60 countries to the National Field Archery Association center.\nOlympic medalist Khatuna Lorig, who is training in Chula Vista, California, for the 2016 Rio de Janeiro summer games, said archery is a terrific family activity."}
