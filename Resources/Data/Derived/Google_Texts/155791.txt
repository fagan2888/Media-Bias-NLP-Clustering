SPRINGFIELD – The U.S. Attorney’s Office said a Decatur man has been charged with robbing a convenience store, then killing a woman to keep her from telling authorities.

The Springfield office said in a news release early Saturday that armed robbery and murder charges against 23-year-old Kelton Snyder are contained in a five-count grand jury indictment returned Thursday.

Authorities said Snyder and another man allegedly robbed the Circle K convenience story on April 3 using masks and firearms. They said Snyder and “conspirators” killed Paige Mars two days later to keep her from going to law enforcement.

The indictment said that Mars had served as the driver of a getaway car during the robbery.

The FBI said Snyder was previously charged in Macon County and now is in U.S. Marshals Service custody.
