The United States Department of Agriculture has recognized the need for affordable healthy eating tips and guidelines for the public, which is why \u201cHealthy Eating on Budget\u201d was born. The webpage is designed to help families find better deals while shopping, provide time-saving ideas, and encourage kitchen cooking and reinventing of leftovers.\n\n\u201cMost of us need to increase our intake of whole fruit, dark-green and orange vegetables, whole grains, and fat-free or low-fat dairy,\u201d according to the USDA\u2019s website.\n\nAccording to the USDA Healthy Eating Index, many Americans are struggling to meet the recommendations from the Dietary Guidelines and often substitute our hunger or lack of resources for less healthy and nutritionally satisfying meals.\n\n\u201cCost is often considered a barrier to eating healthier and the new resource will help consumers overcome this perception,\u201d said the site.\n\nThe USDA has also produced a \u201cHealthy Eating on a Budget\u201d cookbook along with easy-to-read tip sheets. The cookbook\u2019s recipes are featured in a two-week sample menu based on a 2,000-calorie diet. There is also an additional grocery and pantry list to help households plan their purchases as effectively as possible in order to optimize their budget.\n\nTips To Save:\n\nLook for brand name coupons in the Sunday paper inserts every week. Some stores will even double the value of brand name coupons on certain days. Stay organized with your coupons and develop a system that\u2019s easiest for quick and hassle-free finding. The use of three-ring binders, accordion-style organizers, or even plain envelopes are some of the most widely used. Write out a well thought out grocery list and stick to it. This will decrease the chance of being swayed by snacks or easy-made food. Keep foods organized and give them their own place in your kitchen. This will prevent repeat purchases and unnecessary food substitutes. Join your store\u2019s loyalty program in order to receive free savings and electronic coupons straight to your email. Make it simple and straightforward. Simple meals are usually inexpensive and easy to make, which should be a priority throughout the week.\n\nThe importance of learning how to stretch your dollar when you have children, is to provide them with as much nutritionally satisfying meals as possible each day. When children are saved from becoming overweight or obese, they decrease the risk of leading an unhealthy adult life in the future.\n\nToday\u2019s children have grown up eating more processed, packaged, and nutrient-empty foods than any other generation to date, giving birth to a new kind of solution seeking. Childhood obesity has more than doubled in children and tripled in adolescents in the past 30 years, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), a building trend that begs for new solutions. A child who is obese has an 80 percent chance of becoming an obese adult, according to the CDC.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "6, tips, eating, healthy, budget, brought, you, usda", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "The USDA has created a new webpage full of resources in order to help families provide healthy meals on a budget.", "title": "New USDA Program Helps People Eat Healthy On A Budget", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/6-tips-eating-healthy-budget-brought-you-usda-285854", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/01/new-resources-families-trying-eat-healthy-budget.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The USDA has created a new webpage full of resources in order to help families provide healthy meals on a budget.", "title": "New USDA Program Helps People Eat Healthy On A Budget", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/6-tips-eating-healthy-budget-brought-you-usda-285854", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/01/new-resources-families-trying-eat-healthy-budget.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/01/new-resources-families-trying-eat-healthy-budget.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2014-06-01T22:13:55-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-02T00:13:02-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "The USDA has created a new webpage full of resources in order to help families provide healthy meals on a budget."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd00c\"", "article_summary": "The United States Department of Agriculture has recognized the need for affordable healthy eating tips and guidelines for the public, which is why \u201cHealthy Eating on Budget\u201d was born.\nThe USDA has also produced a \u201cHealthy Eating on a Budget\u201d cookbook along with easy-to-read tip sheets.\nThe USDA has created a new webpage full of resources in order to help families provide healthy meals on a budget.\nMoney is often seen as a hurdle to eating healthy for many.\nAccording to the USDA Healthy Eating Index, many Americans are struggling to meet the recommendations from the Dietary Guidelines and often substitute our hunger or lack of resources for less healthy and nutritionally satisfying meals."}
