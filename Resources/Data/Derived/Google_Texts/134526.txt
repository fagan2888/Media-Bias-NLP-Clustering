JACKSON TOWNSHIP -- Former first daughter Chelsea Clinton spent part of this snowy evening in northeastern Pennsylvania.

Clinton headlined a fundraiser at a home in Luzerne County Monday evening.

About 80 people turned out at the home in the Back Mountain all to help raise money for Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign.

The event was private, but attendees said Chelsea Clinton spoke on her mother's behalf for about 20 minutes.

"I was a delegate for her during the last time that she ran in Colorado and I'm as invigorated tonight as I was back when she ran back then. And her daughter, you know they say apple trees make apples, it's no surprise to me that Chelsea hit it right out of the park," said Mark Bufalino of Shavertown.

Hillary Clinton won the Democratic primary in Pennsylvania when she ran for president in 2008.

The Keystone State's primary election this year is April 26.
