Insurers in many states will seek major premium hikes.\n\nLooming rate increases aren\u2019t the only signs of severe stress. Each week brings new evidence that Obamacare is due for more than a checkup; it needs life-saving surgery.\n\nOn April 19, UnitedHealthcare, the nation\u2019s biggest insurer, said it would stop offering coverage in many states next year because of heavy losses. The company had expanded coverage to 34 states, but now it says it can\u2019t afford to cover hundreds of thousands of people in most of those states.\n\nUnited isn\u2019t alone in hemorrhaging. Insurers lost at least $3 billion selling individual plans in 2014, according to researcher Brian Blase, with the Spending and Budget Initiative at the Mercatus Center of George Mason University.\n\nNo wonder other insurers warn that they may follow UnitedHealthcare to the exit, unless they win major premium rate hikes for next year. How high will they go? Here\u2019s a clue: Insurers received $7 billion in a federal subsidy program in 2014. That program expires at the end of this year. Blase and his colleagues estimate premiums would have had to be 26 percent higher in 2014 without that subsidy.\n\nOther options to balance premiums and medical costs: Insurers can raise deductibles, narrow their networks of hospitals and doctors, or find other ways to cut costs.\n\nObamacare is lagging on many fronts:\n\n\u2022 Far fewer people have signed up for private coverage this year than the 20-plus million that the Congressional Budget Office and other experts projected when Congress passed the law in 2010.\n\n\u2022 Insurers are losing money because the people buying polices are older and sicker \u2014 therefore, more expensive to cover \u2014 than experts projected.", "article_metadata": {"description": "News stories of recent days suggest a stabbing pain in the wallet awaiting people who buy health coverage for 2017 through Obamacare exchanges.
