Bale\u2019s relief at scoring, and the magnitude of the win, was evident as he charged over the touchline to hug coach Chris Coleman.\n\nBeating Israel on Sunday will secure a first trip to a tournament since the 1958 World Cup for Wales, which began Thursday by rising to an all-time high ninth in FIFA\u2019s rankings.\n\n\u201cWe know what we have to do,\u201d Bale said. \u201cWe are a strong team, we are together. We know what our capabilities are. We have earned the right to be in this position.\u201d\n\nBelgium nudged closer to the finals in France by beating Bosnia-Herzegovina 3-1 with first-half goals from Marouane Fellaini and Kevin De Bruyne, and a late penalty from Eden Hazard.\n\nWith three games remaining, Israel stayed two points behind Belgium in third after routing Andorra 4-0.\n\nThe top two teams from each of the nine groups are guaranteed a place in France. The best third-place team also qualifies and the other eight contest a play-off.", "article_metadata": {"description": "With a late bullet-header, Gareth Bale powered Wales closer to the European Championship and ending a 58-year wait to qualify for a major tournament again.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "With a late bullet-header, Gareth Bale powered Wales closer to the European Championship and ending a 58-year wait to qualify for a major tournament again.", "title": "Bale powers Wales closer to 1st tournament in 58 years", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/sep/3/bale-powers-wales-closer-to-1st-tournament-in-58-y/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/09/03/d48238459b0efb27800f6a706700ff4e.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/09/03/d48238459b0efb27800f6a706700ff4e.jpg", "description": "With a late bullet-header, Gareth Bale powered Wales closer to the European Championship and ending a 58-year wait to qualify for a major tournament again.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Bale powers Wales closer to 1st tournament in 58 years"}, "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcbeb\"", "article_summary": "NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) - With a late bullet-header, Gareth Bale powered Wales closer to the European Championship and ending a 58-year wait to qualify for a major tournament again.\nIt had been a frustrating 82 minutes for Bale until he rose in the penalty area to meet Ashley Richards\u2019 cross with a powerful header.\nThe top two teams from each of the nine groups are guaranteed a place in France.\nBeating Israel on Sunday will secure a first trip to a tournament since the 1958 World Cup for Wales, which began Thursday by rising to an all-time high ninth in FIFA\u2019s rankings.\n\u201cWe know what we have to do,\u201d Bale said."}
