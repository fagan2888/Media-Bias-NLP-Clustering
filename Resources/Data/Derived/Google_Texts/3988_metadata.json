She was composed, confident, articulate and deftly criticized Bernie Sanders on a range of issues, but without sounding too strident or caustic. But what about substance? Is Clinton newly progressive on some issues or mostly defending centrist status quos as before?\n\nThe verdict, according to a range of progressive analysts is Clinton is talking a more progressive game than her policy prescriptions would deliver. This is true for some of the bigger issues: expanding Social Security, regulating Wall Street, reforming criminal justice, the latest Pacific rim trade agreement, and stating that being a woman makes her the \u201coutsider\u201d candidate.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at six issues that highlight the style verses substance gap.\n\n1. Expanding Social Security. As Isaiah J. Poole wrote at The Campaign for America\u2019s Future, \u201cUnless you listened carefully, you might have missed the expanse of daylight between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders when asked about their plans for Social Security at the CNN Democratic debate Tuesday. It\u2019s a gap that is alarming people who are fighting to protect and strengthen Social Security.\u201d Clinton was asked is she would support Sander\u2019s plan to increase Social Security benefits how much the wealthy pay toward the program from their income taxes. Only the first $118,000 is taxed for it.\n\nClinton said she strongly supported Social Security and opposed privatization efforts, but when asked if she\u2019s raise benefits, replied, \u201cI want to enhance the benefits for the poorest recipients of Social Security\u2026 particularly widowed and single women.\u201d As Poole wrote, \u201cWhat alarmed Social Security activists is that underneath Clinton\u2019s positive language\u2013\u2018fully support,\u2019 \u2018enhance\u2019 \u2013 appears to lie support for policies, including from leading conservatives like Pete Peterson\u2013that would actually undermine Social Security.\u201d\n\nRepublican Paul Ryan, the House Ways and Means Committee chair, uses the same language to protest the poorest people, but \u201cwould reduce benefits for the top 70 percent of wage earners while maintaining benefits for the bottom 30 percent,\u201d Poole said. \u201cThe last thing we need right now is to fear a Trojan horse from a presidential candidate who says she \u2018fully supports\u2019 Social Security.\u201d\n\n2. Wall Street reformer? Beyond the competing rhetoric by Clinton and Sanders that each would take a tougher line with Wall St. practices that undermined the economy and upended millions of lives\u2014such as pushing mortgage-backed securities\u2014the verdict on Democracy Now by 2016 Green Party presidential candidate, Dr. Jill Stein, was clear: Clinton might toughen some oversight but she would not reinstate a law repealed by her husband, President Bill Clinton, which created a new world of risky markets.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s sort of talking out of both sides of her mouth: She wants to go against Wall Street, but she won\u2019t support [reviving] Glass-Steagall,\u201d Stein said. \u201cGlass-Steagall being the law that separated speculative banking from everyday consumer banking and\u2026 prevents banks from taking risks at consumers\u2019 burden\u2026 it prevents bailouts from going forward. So, you know, Glass-Steagall was repealed under the Clinton administration and needs to be brought back. But Senator Clinton does not support it.\u201d\n\n3. Criminal Justice and Prison Reformer? During one of the few exchanges on criminal justice\u2014when legalizing marijuana came up\u2014Clinton said, \u201cWe have got to stop imprisoning people\u2026 We need more states, cities, and the federal government to begin to address this so that we don\u2019t have this terrible result that Senator Sanders was talking about where we have a huge population in our prisons for nonviolent, low-level offenses that are primarily due to marijuana.\u201d\n\nAccording to The Marshall Project, an investigative journalism website tracking criminal justice, only a very small percentage of prison overcrowding is due to non-violent drug offenses. In 2014, only 3.6 percent of people in state prison were there for drug offenses, and 0.3 percent were in federal prison for pot. \u201cAs TPM\u2019s Dana Goldstein pointed out, any attempt to cut incarceration by as much as 50 percent\u2014the target of some reformers\u2014will require shorter sentences not just for marijuana, not just for drugs, and not just for crimes considered non-violent,\u201d the Marshall Project wrote. \u201cBut that\u2019s not an easy sell during a highly competitive campaign season.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "She speaks like a progressive, but don't let that fool you", "author": "Steven Rosenfeld", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "She speaks like a progressive, but don't let that fool you", "title": "6 signs the new Hillary is still the old Hillary", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/10/17/6_signs_that_show_the_new_hillary_is_still_the_old_hillary_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/10/hillary_clinton_debate.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "She speaks like a progressive, but don't let that fool you", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/10/hillary_clinton_debate.jpg", "title": "6 signs the new Hillary is still the old Hillary", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "6 signs the new Hillary is still the old Hillary", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, AlterNet, Hillary Clinton, news, Politics, Progressivism", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Expanding Social Security.\nIs Clinton newly progressive on some issues or mostly defending centrist status quos as before?\nShe was composed, confident, articulate and deftly criticized Bernie Sanders on a range of issues, but without sounding too strident or caustic.\nThe verdict, according to a range of progressive analysts is Clinton is talking a more progressive game than her policy prescriptions would deliver.\nTopics: AlterNet, Hillary Clinton, news, Politics, Progressivism, Elections News, Social News, Politics NewsThis article originally appeared on AlterNetDuring Tuesday\u2019s Democratic debate, Hillary Clinton tried to display a new and more progressive version of the Hillary who Americans have seen for years: as First Lady, U.S."}
