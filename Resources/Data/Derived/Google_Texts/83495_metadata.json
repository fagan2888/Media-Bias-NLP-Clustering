This includes provisions to deal with conflicts of interest\".\n\nCape Schanck resident Irene Wyld is among those opposing the development, and said the RACV had not been receptive to requests the plan be lowered in height. \"They don't feel the need to talk to us because they are big and powerful and they will not compromise on anything,\" she said.\n\nThe RACV did not respond to repeated attempts to contact it on Sunday.\n\nMornington Peninsula mayor Bev Colomb confirmed conflicts of interest had caused the delay on the vote on the proposed RACV resort. The hold-up would only be a matter of weeks, she said. \"Everyone wants to be around the table and feel conflict-free,\" she said. \"This is just a postponement. We will be determining the issue soon.\"\n\nThe Municipal Association of Victoria's chief, Rob Spence, said that conflict of interest rules were very tight in the state. \"And that's why you get situations like what you are observing at Mornington Peninsula,\" he said.\n\nIn Melbourne City Council's case, six councillors, including the lord mayor, had been unable to vote since 2013 on a plan to introduce a subdivision tax to create new open space in the city.\n\nHigh-rise builder Central Equity had contributed thousands of dollars to the election campaigns of the Doyle team, and the chair of planning Ken Ong.\n\nMs Hutchins granted the councillors in that case an exemption allowing them to vote on the subdivision tax, but warned the council these requests should not become \"par [for] the course\".\n\nThe need for the Local Government Minister to be called in led Greens councillor Rohan Leppert to renew calls for a total ban on building developers making donations to state and local government candidates.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "RACV, Cape Schanck, National Golf Club, Mornington Peninsula Shire Council, Mornington Peninsula", "application-name": "The Age", "og": {"site_name": "The Age", "description": "A $135 million hotel and conference centre at Cape Schanck has been put on hold after a number of Mornington Peninsula Shire councillors said they were members of the RACV, the group behind the development.", "title": "Conflicts of interest shut down council vote on big Mornington Peninsula project", "url": "http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/conflicts-of-interest-shut-down-council-vote-on-big-mornington-peninsula-project-20150524-gh8iwv.html", "image": "http://www.theage.com.au/content/dam/images/g/h/8/l/k/7/image.related.articleLeadwide.620x349.gh8iwv.png/1432456394595.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@theage", "image": {"src": "http://www.theage.com.au/content/dam/images/g/h/8/l/k/7/image.related.articleLeadwide.620x349.gh8iwv.png/1432456394595.jpg"}, "description": "A $135 million hotel and conference centre at Cape Schanck has been put on hold after a number of Mornington Peninsula Shire councillors said they were members of the RACV, the group behind the development.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Conflicts of interest shut down council vote on big Mornington Peninsula project"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Open The Age", "robots": "ACAP allow-present prohibited-modification=annotation", "fb": {"app_id": 230318243699378}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.theage.com.au", "msapplication-task": "name=Weather;action-uri=http://www.theage.com.au/weather;icon-uri=http://www.theage.com.au/favicon.ico;", "description": "A $135 million hotel and conference centre at Cape Schanck has been put on hold after a number of Mornington Peninsula Shire councillors said they were members ..."}, "article_summary": "Mornington Peninsula councillors have a conflict of interest over plans for a $135 million RACV conference centre at Cape Schanck.\nMornington Peninsula mayor Bev Colomb confirmed conflicts of interest had caused the delay on the vote on the proposed RACV resort.\nCouncil officers had recommended approving the project, and opponents say councillors were waving it through purely on economic grounds.\nPlans for a $135 million RACV conference centre at Cape Schanck have been put on hold, after Mornington Peninsula councillors said they had a conflict of interest \u2013 due to their memberships with the motoring group.\nLocal Government Minister Natalie Hutchins has been called in to adjudicate on whether the conflicts of interest in this case are severe enough to stop councillors voting."}
