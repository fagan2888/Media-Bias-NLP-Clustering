Four current Hall County employees were recently promoted to leadership positions, which school officials said is a reflection of the strength of the district’s employees.

“You’d be very proud,” said Brad Brown, executive director for human resources for Hall County Schools. “In each of the people we interviewed, you’d be proud of the professionalism, the honesty and the passion. ... I’ve had so many people say it was a good process.”

The Hall County Board of Education approved four leadership positions at a called board meeting Tuesday.

Karla Swafford, previously serving as West Hall Middle School principal, was approved as the new director of special education. Rodney Stephens, West Hall Middle assistant principal, will replace Swafford as principal.

Kristin Finley, who worked alongside Stephens as West Hall Middle assistant principal, was approved to become principal at East Hall Middle School, and Jennifer Kogod will serve as Chestatee Academy’s new principal. She currently serves as one of the school’s assistant principals.

Three other new principals were previously approved for the 2015-2016 school year, including Donna Wiggins to replace retiring Debra Smith at Riverbend Elementary; Laurie Hitzges, to team with current co-principal Brittany Bennett as co-principal at World Language Academy; and Pam Doig to replace retiring Catherine Rosa at McEver Arts Academy.
