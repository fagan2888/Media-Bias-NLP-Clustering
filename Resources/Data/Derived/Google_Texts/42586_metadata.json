So far, Cristol is the only woman seeking the Democratic nomination to replace retiring Board members Mary Hynes and Walter Tejada.\n\nChristian Dorsey, who sought and lost the Democratic nomination to Chris Zimmerman and Walter Tejada in 2002 and 2003, said he has decided 2015 is the right time to try again and \u201cpropel the next progressive wave in Arlington.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are an extremely well-planned community\u2026 but even in a well-planned community like Arlington we still face challenges, and those challenges are immense,\u201d Dorsey said, adding that he has \u201cthe right set of skills and perspectives for this point in time in Arlington.\u201d\n\nThat perspective includes having served on the board of the Arlington Street People\u2019s Assistance Network, as chair of the Arlington Tenant-Landlord Commission and as executive director of the Bonder and Amanda Johnson Community Development Corporation in the Nauck neighborhood.\n\n\u201cWe have to be honest, Arlington is a privileged place but we still have people who are suffering from stagnating wages, many people in our community are on fixed incomes\u2026 people don\u2019t have the means that they used to,\u201d Dorsey said. \u201cThat means that we have to deliver good government at maximum value, but also come up with innovative ways of making it a little easier for people to go through life.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can save money by doing good,\u201d Dorsey said. \u201cProgressive values often make very sound fiscal sense.\u201d\n\nAndrew Schneider, president of the Yorktown Civic Association and a life-long Arlingtonian, has made \u201clistening\u201d and \u201csolving old problems in new ways\u201d central tenets of his campaign.\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019ve learned anything over the past twelve months, it\u2019s been that the public confidence in Arlington has been shaken,\u201d said Schneider. \u201cMy candidacy is founded on helping to restore that confidence. You do not restore the public confidence through the sandbox politics and knee-jerk opposition that has characterized our community dialogue over the past two years.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou restore the public confidence by listening to the messages that have been sent and acknowledging that they have been heard, by listening to all of Arlington. Every corner, ever corridor, every neighborhood \u2014 one Arlington, one community.\u201d continued Schneider. \u201cI\u2019ve listened, and I\u2019ve heard a consistent message: make things easier for me, for my family, for my children, for my business, for my aging parents.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs a County Board member you will have my pledge to act every day to make Arlington one strong and vibrant community,\u201d Schneider promised. \u201cI will never stop listening or working on behalf of you.\u201d\n\n\u201cArlington is not just the suburb across the river \u2014 with a lot of soul, I might add. We are also the city on the hill, which has been a leader of communities around the region and country,\u201d he said. \u201cI love the Democratic party, and I\u2019m honored to stand on the shoulders of those who have come before me and made this community the great place it is today.\u201d\n\nPeter Fallon, who last ran for the County Board nomination in 2014, cited his track record of community involvement, including service on the county\u2019s Planning Commission. He said he didn\u2019t always win friends while on the commission \u2014 but said that\u2019s a good thing.\n\n\u201cI gained a reputation for coming across a bit prickly,\u201d Fallon said. \u201cIf I come off prickly or mad it\u2019s because I see someone not getting a fair hearing or being brushed aside. I demand fairness and that everyone, even the little guy, deserves a voice. I have advocated for these folks even when it was not the most popular or politically expedient thing to do.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe way things are going right now, maybe we can use a little pricklier County Board member,\u201d Fallon continued. \u201cShifts in the landscape have put some of our bedrock democratic principles into question. We need someone who is tough enough to defend these values and experienced enough to make sure the right things get done.\u201d\n\nFallon, who said he has \u201creached out to 10,000 voters\u201d and is \u201ca different candidate than I was a year ago,\u201d advocated against making radical changes to county policy.\n\n\u201cWe still have to do more to keep our economy competitive, address school overcrowding and make our tax dollars stretch further,\u201d he said. \u201cI know that some of you are upset and want to take an axe to the county, but this is a time to use a scalpel.\u201d\n\nJames Lander, current chair of the Arlington School Board and a U.S. Navy veteran, was the last to announce his candidacy at the meeting.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m excited because this is a historic time in our wonderful community,\u201d Lander said. \u201cThis is a time for bold, experienced, reform-minded leadership. I am that leader, I am that reform candidate.\u201d\n\nLander said that as a County Board member, he would work to add school capacity, maintain green space and preserve affordable housing.\n\n\u201cI will be results-oriented and will focus on feasible solutions,\u201d he said. \u201cAs your County Board member, I will support our schools by maximizing existing facilities. As a steward of your tax dollars, I understand that we cannot afford to build enough facilities fast enough to accommodate our enrollment crisis. We must be more creative and innovative in our thinking and our approach.\u201d\n\nEarlier in the night, speaking as the School Board chair, Lander encouraged Democrats to support additional funding for schools, beyond what\u2019s proposed in the County Manager\u2019s budget recommendation.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t cut our way forward,\u201d he said.\n\nAs did other candidates, Lander said he would prioritize the retention of businesses in Arlington, in part by exploring \u201clow-cost ways to improve the processes by which businesses work with our county government.\u201d He concluded by saying that he was ready to make tough decisions as a County Board member.\n\n\u201cI will not tolerate the status quo,\u201d he said. \u201cI will make principled decisions based on what\u2019s best for our community, even if it means being the lone dissenting voice.\u201d\n\nThe Democratic primary will be held on Tuesday, June 9.", "article_metadata": {"city": "Arlington", "description": "(Updated at 5:35 p.m.) Change and a fresh perspective is needed on the County Board -- that was the overall message from the five Democrats\u00a0seeking the", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "ARLnow.com - Arlington, Va. - Breaking News, Opinions & Community Happenings", "description": "(Updated at 5:35 p.m.) Change and a fresh perspective is needed on the County Board -- that was the overall message from the five Democrats\u00a0seeking the nomination for two open board seats.\r\n\r\nWhile all of the candidates touted their \"progressive values\" at Wednesday's Arlington Co", "title": "County Board Candidates Promise Change, Progressive Values", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://www.arlnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ge-041_825x550.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-03-06T17:35:20+00:00", "url": "https://www.arlnow.com/2015/03/06/county-board-candidates-promise-change-progressive-values/", "type": "article"}, "country": "USA", "State": "Virginia", "keywords": "arlington democrats,county board,election,news", "article": {"section": "News", "published_time": "2015-03-06T16:30:34+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-06T17:35:20+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcca61\"", "article_summary": "While all of the candidates touted their \u201cprogressive values\u201d at Wednesday\u2019s Arlington County Democratic Committee meeting, most suggested that the Democratic status quo is in need of a refresh.\n\u201cAs your County Board member, I will support our schools by maximizing existing facilities.\n(Updated at 5:35 p.m.) Change and a fresh perspective is needed on the County Board \u2014 that was the overall message from the five Democrats seeking the nomination for two open board seats.\nI am that leader, I am that reform candidate.\u201dLander said that as a County Board member, he would work to add school capacity, maintain green space and preserve affordable housing.\n\u201cThe County Board needs new insights and perspectives\u2026 we need leaders with renewed energy and optimism,\u201d said Katie Cristol, a relative unknown in political circles who delivered an energetic speech to the standing room only crowd."}
