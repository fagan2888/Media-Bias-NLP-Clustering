Firefighter Who Failed Fitness Tests Injures Herself 10 Days Into Job

The push for supposed gender equality in the workplace has put increasing pressure on emergency services as well as the armed forces to lower the bar for physical ability in order to allow for more women in their ranks. The New York Fire Department did just that, allowing women who had failed their physical fitness tests to graduate from the academy.

Now a woman who was allowed to become a New York firefighter despite her failing to meet physical standards has injured herself after only ten days on the job.

Choeurlyne Doirin-Holder broke her foot during a routine equipment check and is not out on paid medical leave. Doirin-Holder made headlines last summer, when her classmates publicly criticized her, claiming she was unfit for the job. However, a judge ruled her a “priority hire” despite her physical limitations.





The New York Post reports:

A firefighter who was allowed to graduate the Fire Academy despite failing physical tests has already gone out on medical leave — just 10 days into the job, The Post has learned. Probationary firefighter Choeurlyne Doirin-Holder injured herself Monday while conducting a routine check of equipment at Queens’ Engine 308 in South Richmond Hill. Getting off the truck, Doirin-Holder missed a step and landed on her left foot, suffering a fracture, sources said. It was her second shift after a transfer from Engine 301. In training for a hazmat assignment, officers found her struggling to perform the required tasks. Firefighters called the tripping incident embarrassing — and alarming. “If you’re going to get hurt in the firehouse checking a rig, what would happen at a fire?” an insider asked.

PC attitudes and rhetoric about equality do not make women physically equal to men. Putting them into positions like this when they do not qualify will only put theirs and other’s safety at risk.
