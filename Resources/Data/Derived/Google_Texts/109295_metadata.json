Arguably, that article -- by the Guy\u2019s talented predecessor as \u201cTime\u201d religion writer, lay Catholic Mayo Mohs -- put the \u201cJesus freaks\u201d permanently on the cultural map.\n\nThe following can only sketch mere strands of a complex phenomenon and offers as much theorizing as hard fact. For some of the history, the Guy is indebted to the valuable \u201cEncyclopedia of Evangelicalism\u201d by Randall Balmer of Dartmouth College.\n\nQuick summary: The Jesus Movement developed pre-existing phenomena into a youth wing that energized and reshaped U.S. evangelical Protestantism as a whole. This occurred just as evangelicalism was clearly emerging as the largest segment of American religion while beginning in the mid-1960s moderate to liberal \u201cmainline\u201d Protestant groups began inexorable decline.\n\nThe Jesus Movement was related to and influenced by the \u201cCharismatic Movement,\u201d which first reached public notice around 1960. This wave took a loosened version of Pentecostal spirituality into \u201cmainline\u201d Protestant and Catholic settings and, especially, newer and wholly independent congregations, along with free-floating gatherings akin to the secular Woodstock (August, 1969).\n\nEarly \u201cstreet Christians\u201d clustered around hot spots such as the Living Room in San Francisco\u2019s Haight-Ashbury district, the Christian World Liberation Front adjacent to the University of California at Berkeley, Seattle\u2019s Jesus People Army, and His Place on the Sunset Strip (led by Arthur Blessitt who later evangelized his way across the nation pulling an outsize wheeled cross).\n\nThe first and foremost impact of the movement was upon the lives of individual teens and young adults who turned to robust Christian faith in those years. There\u2019s no way of calculating the number of those affected by these scattered phenomena. Many were enabled to escape the bonds of substance abuse and other aspects of the youth culture\u2019s underside. Some later popped up as ministers and lay leaders.\n\nLove Inn is an example of a second aspect, a Jesus haven that eventually turned into a conventional congregation complete with a Christian school. Its founder in 1969 was \u201cScott\u201d Ross, a noted rock D.J. who was \u201cborn again\u201d in an era of drug-related deaths and other tragedies. One early Love Inn participant was star guitarist Phil Keaggy, one of many Christian rock and pop artists who were emerging.\n\nThe third result was groups that grew into megachurches.\n\nContinue reading \"What\u2019s the Jesus Movement\u2019s impact 45 years later?\", by Richard Ostling.", "article_metadata": {"description": "JOSH\u2019S QUERY:\r\n\r\n[Referring to Time magazine's 1971 cover story on the youthful \"Jesus \r\nRevolution\"] \u00a0A lot has happened since then -- culturally, religiously, \r\nmovement-wise -- and I\u2019d be fascinated to see you revisit your journalistic \r\nand theological mind.\r\n\r\nTHE RELIGION GUY\u2019S RESPONSE:\r\n\r\nThis interests Josh because his parents were members of Love Inn, which \r\ntypified the youth-driven \u201cJesus Movement\u201d of those days.
