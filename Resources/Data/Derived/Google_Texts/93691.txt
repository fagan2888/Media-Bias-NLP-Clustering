Police on Friday are looking for a hit-and-run suspect who ran away from a car after causing a crash that ejected one person from a car and left them with life-threatening injuries.

Authorities are still searching for the suspect, said Tyrone Campbell, a Denver police spokesman.

The collision happened at 4:15 a.m. Friday at Interstate 25 on the ramp toward northbound Interstate 225, authorities say. The I-25 ramp was then closed.

Two vehicles collided on the ramp when one car rammed a car carrying four people, Campbell said. One of the passengers in the car that was struck was thrown out of the car, he said, and suffered life-threatening injuries.

The conditions of the other passengers in the car was unknown as of Friday afternoon.

The driver of the other car, who is a suspect in the hit-and-run crash, abandoned the car on foot.

Campbell said it was too early to determine whether alcohol was a factor in this crash.

This story will be updated as new details are available.
