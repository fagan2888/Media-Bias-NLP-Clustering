Previously, she was the Director of the Health Privacy Project at the Center for Democracy & Technology (CDT), leading efforts to promote privacy and security protections for electronic personal health information.\n\nBeing immersed in D.C. conversations and meetings, McGraw has her finger on the pulse of major policy happenings in healthcare IT. With the Stage 3 proposed rule scheduled to be released in a few weeks at the beginning of March, Healthcare Informatics Senior Editor Gabriel Perna recently spoke with McGraw to see if she\u2019d offer some predictions for our readers.\n\nBelow are excerpts from part one of this two-part interview series.\n\nThe Stage 3 proposed rule of meaningful use is coming soon. What are your expectations?\n\nI think that based on the emphasis on the Office of the National Coordinator, [it will focus on] making sure the goals of interoperability are achieved, the capability to exchange data and for disparate systems to be able to take that data and consume it and use it to populate their electronic health record (EHR) systems. We\u2019re not talking digital fax machines. We\u2019re talking about the ability to meaningfully exchange data so the recipient can use it and also disclose it, so the real sharing of data envisioned by HITECH (the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act) and by the Affordable Care Act (ACA) can actually occur.\n\nWhen we were talking about Stage 3 initially as a Health IT Policy Committee\u2014we started the conversation well before Dr. DeSalvo came on board and the ONC started to double down on interoperability\u2026.and we as a policy committee thought it\u2019s important that Stage 3 move towards more achievement of outcomes vs. necessarily the objectives that emphasize a lot process. This was a hard discussion. While there was recognition among the committee that this was indeed the ultimate goal of meaningful use, the trajectory of how you get there and if you take your foot off the foot of the gas of some of these process objectives, there was a lot less consensus on that. If you abandoned an objective entirely and just asked them to demonstrate good outcomes for diabetes patients, for example, there was concern we\u2019d lose the progress we\u2019d made process wise in Steps 1 and 2.\n\nThe Policy Committee\u2019s Stage 3 was a thoughtful articulation of the tension between wanting to move to more outcome-based measures and concern about abandoning the incremental approach. After that discussion, the focus on interoperability occurred and that creates the imperative to think about the most important achievements that we need to get from the expenditure of the tax dollars of Stage 3. It\u2019s less money than Stage 1 and 2, a lot less. And we always presume the program is going to have an escalator-type trajectory, rather than incrementally managing how providers do things.\n\nI do suspect there will be more of a focus on interoperability and potentially a bit of relief in terms of the degree of specificity for the objectives and maybe some of the quality reporting measures. It\u2019s hard to predict. CMS sets these measures, not ONC. I\u2019m sure there is cross-office dialogue and I do sense from the way ONC has been proceeding, thinking through the roadmap to interoperability, they presume this is an all hands on deck exercise. I think that leads me to presume there will be a heightened focus on interoperability in Stage 3, and relief on some of the objectives providers complained about.\n\nWhat are some things you\u2019ll be looking for from the Stage 3 proposed rule that pushes the industry forward on interoperability?\n\nI think it will be interesting to see what comes out in the proposed rule. There was pushback and discomfort among the meaningful user community, the providers and hospitals participating in program, with how the objectives for the exchange of data were presented in Stage 2. This includes the certain percentages of exchange needing to happen, in terms of provider to provider exchange of data, the requirements that patients need to take advantage of view , download and transmit and at least take a look at their data or exchange in a secure email. That still feels like a check the box approach to achieving interoperability, as opposed to looking holistically at whether you\u2019re care is better coordinated for your patients because you\u2019ve able to exchange data with all the patients\u2019 providers, regardless whether you\u2019re seeing providers within your institution or outside of boundaries. The presumption is that in most cases, except for people who come into closed systems like Kaiser, patients, especially those with multiple chronic illnesses, are going to have multiple providers using multiple vendor systems. How do you reward the interoperable exchange of data, in a way that\u2019s less check the box? There is not as many options as we\u2019d like, outcomes measured is one way.\n\nWhat about this notion that Stage 3 could be interoperability only?", "article_metadata": {"com.silverpop.brandeddomains": "www.pages04.net,assistedhousingfinancialinsider.com,assistedhousinginsider.com,commercialleaselawinsider.com,constructionsuperconference.com,efaconference.com,secure.rhq.com,secure2.rhq.com,www.addictionpro.com,www.apartmentlawinsider.com,www.assistedhousinginsider.com,www.behavioral.net,www.commercialleaselawinsider.com,www.commercialtenantsleaseinsider.com,www.communityassociationinsider.com,www.constructionsuperconference.com,www.entjournal.com,www.environmentsforaging.com,www.etouches.com,www.fairhousingcoach.com,www.hcd11.com,www.healthcare-informatics.com,www.healthcarebuildingideas.com,www.healthcaredesignmagazine.com,www.herdjournal.com,www.ihealthtran.com,www.landlordvtenant.com,www.ltlmagazine.com,www.nycapartmentlaw.com,www.taxcredithousinginsider.com,www.vendomegrp.com,www.vendomerealestatemedia.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "com.silverpop.cothost": "engage4.silverpop.com"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb12b\"", "article_summary": "Deven McGraw is a name that should be familiar to most health IT policy followers.\nBeing immersed in D.C. conversations and meetings, McGraw has her finger on the pulse of major policy happenings in healthcare IT.\nI think that leads me to presume there will be a heightened focus on interoperability in Stage 3, and relief on some of the objectives providers complained about.\nWhat are some things you\u2019ll be looking for from the Stage 3 proposed rule that pushes the industry forward on interoperability?\nHow do you reward the interoperable exchange of data, in a way that\u2019s less check the box?"}
