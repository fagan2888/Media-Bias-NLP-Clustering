Research by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that, in 2014, 80 percent of all covered workers had to pay an annual deductible, the amount they pay out of pocket before insurance kicks in. The average deductible was $1,215, up 47 percent from the $826 average in 2009, the study said.\n\nJason Mahler, a large-market strategist with insurance giant AON, said at a recent seminar in Albuquerque that employers will be putting more emphasis on encouraging employees to espouse healthier lifestyles in order to reduce their need for health care services, make them more productive in the workplace, and help cut the volume and size of insurance claims.\n\nAs a result, workplace wellness programs are becoming more common, but some employers are also using financial incentives to encourage employees to take up healthier lifestyles.\n\nWellness programs can include\n\n\u2022 Discounted gym memberships, or free or low-cost exercise classes at a gym or at the workplace\n\n\u2022 Free or discounts on tobacco cessation programs and rewards for staying tobacco-free\n\n\u2022 Free health-risk screenings that check things like body fat, blood pressure, weight and blood glucose levels\n\n\u2022 Access to care coordination to help an employee manage a chronic health situation, such as diabetes\n\n\u2022 Education on nutrition and benefits of exercise, and healthy food cooking demonstrations\n\n\u2022 Exercise challenges with merchandise or financial rewards\n\n\u201cWe are encouraging our members to take more responsibility for their health and wellness. If employees or employers move to a high-deductible health plan, then they need tools to see where their health care dollars are going to serve them better,\u201d said Becky Kenny, spokeswoman for Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Mexico.\n\nAON Health Transformation Strategist Aparna Niroola said employers can nudge workers to take more responsibility for their health by offering them opportunities to exercise, giving guidance on nutrition and monitoring key health measurements, such as blood pressure and blood glucose levels.\n\nThe speakers said technology, such as wrist-worn devices that can track statistics on steps, calories burned and sleep quality, or contact lenses that can measure blood glucose levels, would likely play a greater role in employer wellness programs of the future.\n\nMany employers in Albuquerque have already embraced the wellness concept with programs that encourage employees to lose weight, stop smoking, get fit or avoid the risk of flu.\n\nWhile mostly available at larger companies, there are options for businesses with 20 or fewer employees, as well, said Linda Reiter, senior director of clinical quality and medical management for NM Health Connections, which began offering insurance in late 2013.\n\nHealth Connections has a partnership with the Wellness Council of America to provide smaller employers with educational programs about the benefits of exercise and healthy nutrition. These can be combined with information about workplace safety and stress or injury reduction through stretching techniques, Reiter said.\n\nKenny said Blue Cross also offers some wellness programs to small employers.\n\nOne new trend, Reiter said, is to offer online \u201cvirtual\u201d wellness campaigns, where employees can log in and form teams to meet specific goals, like losing weight. \u201cIt\u2019s something that small companies should think about,\u201d she said.\n\nHelping make it worthwhile\n\nCompanies that already have wellness programs typically offer incentives, such as the chance to lower premiums, discounts on health club memberships, free health-risk assessments, flu shots or cash rewards.\n\nWells Fargo employees, for example, can earn up to $800 toward a health savings account by completing an extensive health assessment and education program.\n\nPresbyterian Healthcare Services employees who smoke pay higher monthly premiums, but the company offers employees and their eligible dependents free access to the American Cancer Society\u2019s Quit for Life smoking cessation program.\n\nPublic Service Company of New Mexico will reimburse up to $750 a year for certain tobacco quitting aids and employees who remain tobacco-free for several months can receive a cash reward, said Ryan Baca, a PNM media representative.\n\nBaca credits her employer\u2019s wellness programs with helping her to lose 65 pounds and become an avid cyclist. The company offers employees things such as discounted weight watcher classes and free biometric testing. There is also an on-site gym at the Downtown office that employees can use for a nominal monthly fee.\n\n\u201cAfter the ACA passed, we realized change was coming and we really had to change our programs to emphasize wellness because, in the past, we had seen significant increases in health costs,\u201d said PNM Human Resources Manager Laurie Monfiletto.\n\nShe said the wellness programs and coordinating care for employees with chronic health conditions has enabled PNM to save $3 million on its health plans and claims over three years.\n\nHealth and Wellness specialist Shane Schumann at the Albuquerque Bernalillo County Water Utility Authority\n\nsaid the agency\u2019s wellness programs\u2019 focus has been on results, such as helping employees lose weight or bring their blood pressure under control. That has helped the agency save money on insurance.\n\n\u201cNow that seems to be shifting toward what benefit it brings to employees. It\u2019s more focused on the person,\u201d Schumann said.\n\nHe said field employees attend mandatory wellness meetings conducted by a trainer before or after work where they learn about nutrition, exercise and techniques to avoid workplace injuries. Office employees can attend free classes at Sports & Wellness gyms. Yoga classes recently became part of the wellness offerings.\n\nCustomer service representative Mellisa Cuellar tried the yoga class and took advantage of the free gym classes, something she said she probably wouldn\u2019t have done if her employer didn\u2019t offer them.\n\nKeeping employees motivated to participate in wellness programs is a challenge, said Silvia Gentile, human resources manager at SolAero Technologies, which bought Emcore\u2019s space photovoltaics business in December.\n\n\u201cSome things work initially \u2013 and then they don\u2019t,\u201d Gentile said.\n\nShe said the company has tried offering incentives, such as an airplane trip for the winner of its \u201cbiggest loser\u201d weight loss contest.\n\nOther incentives companies mentioned included the chance to lower insurance premiums or win prizes like an iPad or gift card.\n\n\u201cOften it comes back to culture of the company,\u201d said Eric Weinstein, executive vice president and managing director of AON in Albuquerque. \u201cWellness has to be ingrained throughout to have that lasting impact.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. \u2014 Spurred in part by ACA, more employers embrace initiatives to provide incentives to help employees improve their health", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Rosalie Rayburn | Journal Staff Writer", "og": {"url": "http://www.abqjournal.com/555998/wellness.html", "image": "http://www.abqjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/mb01_jd_16mar_3health.jpg", "type": "website", "description": "Spurred in part by ACA, more employers embrace initiatives to provide incentives to help employees improve their health", "title": "Updated: Promoting wellness"}, "fb": {"pages": 76430478236, "app_id": 419447351433280}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde7bf\"", "article_summary": "Baca credits her employer\u2019s wellness programs with helping her to lose 65 pounds and become an avid cyclist.\n\u201cOften it comes back to culture of the company,\u201d said Eric Weinstein, executive vice president and managing director of AON in Albuquerque.\nMany employers in Albuquerque have already embraced the wellness concept with programs that encourage employees to lose weight, stop smoking, get fit or avoid the risk of flu.\nAs a result, workplace wellness programs are becoming more common, but some employers are also using financial incentives to encourage employees to take up healthier lifestyles.\nKenny said Blue Cross also offers some wellness programs to small employers."}
