Limited arrays of physicians and doctors are a common feature of the plans, which are striving to offer low-cost products that appeal to Americans who have previously declined to buy health insurance.\n\nTo be included in Anthem's Kentucky network, hospitals must meet specific criteria, including the requirement that they serve\u2014directly or through an affiliate\u2014at least four of Kentucky's eight Medicaid regions and meet certain quality and cost-effective benchmarks. The insurance department has since ordered the insurer to accept applications from UK Healthcare, Our Lady of Bellefonte and Highlands Regional because they meet Anthem's conditions.Officials have not shared the details of other complaints that are not yet resolved.According to Anthem spokeswoman Gene Rodriquez, a network strategy pushes patients to hospitals with the best rates is necessary in order to keep plans affordable. \u201cWe did a lot of research, and it's what our own customers have asked for,\u201d Rodriguez said. \u201cIt's to ensure those costs were kept at a reasonable rate.\u201dIn addition to Anthem, four other insurers are selling policies through Kynect\u2014 Humana United Healthcare , Bluegrass Family Health and Kentucky Health Cooperative. As of Nov. 21, more than 56,000 Kentucky residents had enrolled in health insurance through the exchange. Approximately 640,000 Kentuckians were uninsured when Kynect opened Oct. 1.In October, Seattle (Wash.) Children's Hospital filed what was believed to be the first lawsuit to arise from friction over narrow networks in exchange plans, arguing that state regulators inappropriately approved plans that excluded the facility.Follow Rachel Landen on Twitter: @MHrlanden", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#0a365e", "description": "Eleven Kentucky hospitals have filed complaints with the state's insurance department because they were left out of narrow provider networks in plans sold on Kynect, Kentucky's new insurance exchange.", "title": "11 Ky. hospitals say they were excluded from exchange plans", "og": {"site_name": "Modern Healthcare", "description": "Eleven Kentucky hospitals have filed complaints with the state's insurance department because they were left out of narrow provider networks in plans sold on Kynect, Kentucky's new insurance exchange.", "title": "11 Ky. hospitals say they were excluded from exchange plans", "url": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20131126/NEWS/311269973", "image": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/modernhealthcare/mh-logo/master/mh-logo-fb-lg.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com", "description": "Eleven Kentucky hospitals have filed complaints with the state's insurance department because they were left out of narrow provider networks in plans sold on Kynect, Kentucky's new insurance exchange.", "title": "11 Ky. hospitals say they were excluded from exchange plans", "image": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/modernhealthcare/mh-logo/master/mh-logo-twitter.jpg", "creator": "@modrnhealthcr", "site": "@modrnhealthcr", "card": "summary"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Modern Healthcare", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "url": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20131126/NEWS/311269973", "published_at": "2013-11-26", "msapplication-TileImage": "https:/raw.githubusercontent.com/modernhealthcare/mh-logo/master/ms-touch-icon-144x144-precomposed.png", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "image": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/modernhealthcare/mh-logo/master/mh-logo-g-plus.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb334\"", "article_summary": "As of Nov. 21, more than 56,000 Kentucky residents had enrolled in health insurance through the exchange.\n\u201cIt's to ensure those costs were kept at a reasonable rate.\u201dIn addition to Anthem, four other insurers are selling policies through Kynect\u2014 Humana United Healthcare , Bluegrass Family Health and Kentucky Health Cooperative.\nLimited arrays of physicians and doctors are a common feature of the plans, which are striving to offer low-cost products that appeal to Americans who have previously declined to buy health insurance.\n\u201cWe did a lot of research, and it's what our own customers have asked for,\u201d Rodriguez said.\nTo be included in Anthem's Kentucky network, hospitals must meet specific criteria, including the requirement that they serve\u2014directly or through an affiliate\u2014at least four of Kentucky's eight Medicaid regions and meet certain quality and cost-effective benchmarks."}
