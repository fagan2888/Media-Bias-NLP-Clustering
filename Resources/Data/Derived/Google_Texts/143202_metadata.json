Nowak, the research director of Breakaway Policy Strategies, a health care consulting company. A survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that the average deductible for individual coverage in employer-sponsored plans was $1,217 this year.\n\nIn comparison, the average deductible for a bronze plan on the exchange \u2014 the least expensive coverage \u2014 was $5,081 for an individual and $10,386 for a family, according to HealthPocket, a consulting firm. Silver plans, which were the most popular option this year, had average deductibles of $2,907 for an individual and $6,078 for a family.\n\nJon R. Gabel, a health economist at NORC, a research organization affiliated with the University of Chicago, said that employer-sponsored plans had lower deductibles, in part, because they provided more generous coverage than the most popular exchange plans. The typical employer-sponsored health plan would qualify as a gold-level policy under the standards of the Affordable Care Act, Mr. Gabel said.\n\nThe website for the federal insurance marketplace serving 36 states, HealthCare.gov, strongly encourages consumers to focus on premiums: When consumers search for a plan online, the results are ranked by premium price, with plans offering the lowest premiums listed first.\n\nBut insurance plans with lower premiums generally have higher deductibles. Gina Brown, 37, of Nashville, was paying about $155 a month for a Blue Cross Blue Shield of Tennessee plan, after taking account of her subsidy. But her deductible was $4,000, she said, and so she avoided going to the doctor even when she got an ear infection over the summer.\n\n\u201cI attempted to treat it with over-the-counter and homeopathic meds,\u201d she said. \u201cEventually it went away.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMs. Brown recently got a job with health benefits, so she canceled the marketplace plan. Her new insurance has a deductible of $1,000, but primary care visits and prescriptions are not subject to the deductible.\n\n\u201cNow that I know I can go and safely just pay a co-pay,\u201d she said, \u201cit makes me feel better.\u201d\n\nMark Yuschak, 57, of Jackson, N.J., said he had a silver plan with an annual deductible of $3,000. He discovered its limits in March.\n\n\u201cMy wife had an incident, a digestive disorder, and we had to go to the emergency room of a hospital in Freehold, N.J.,\u201d Mr. Yuschak said. \u201cWe presented our insurance card and filled out all the forms. They told us, \u2018You don\u2019t have a co-payment, you\u2019re free to go.\u2019 \u201d\n\nLater, though, they received a bill \u201cthat could choke a horse,\u201d Mr. Yuschak said \u2014 for more than $1,000. \u201cOur insurance wouldn\u2019t cover any of it because we had not met our deductible.\u201d\n\nCarol Payne, a respiratory therapist in Gilbert, Ariz., signed up through HealthCare.gov for a Blue Cross Blue Shield plan with a $6,000 deductible. She pays $91 toward her monthly premium and gets a subsidy of $353 to cover the rest.\n\nThe plans she could have chosen with lower deductibles were from insurers that \u201cwere not as reputable,\u201d Ms. Payne said. She has used the insurance for preventive care and an emergency room visit after a car accident.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just doing what I can to keep myself healthy,\u201d she added. \u201cI mean, $6,000 \u2014 do they think I\u2019ve just got that under my mattress?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nPeople with low incomes may qualify for subsidies that reduce their deductibles, co-payments and other out-of-pocket costs. The assistance is available to people with incomes from 100 percent to 250 percent of the poverty level (from $23,550 to $58,875 for a family of four), but only if they choose a silver plan.\n\nConsumers also benefit from a provision of the Affordable Care Act that limits out-of-pocket costs, which include deductibles. The limit this year is $6,350 for an individual and $12,700 for a family plan. But in general, the limits apply only to care provided by doctors and hospitals in a plan\u2019s network and do not cap charges for out-of-network care.\n\nDr. Rebecca Love, of Moab, Utah, is well on her way to passing that limit. Dr. Love, 63, who has degenerative arthritis and a host of other health problems, pays $422 a month in premiums for a plan that has a deductible of $6,000. But she has already paid more than $6,000 in medical costs this year that did not count toward her deductible because the doctors and hospitals \u2014 more than 100 miles away in Grand Junction, Colo. \u2014 were not in her network.\n\nTo see certain specialists in her network, Dr. Love said, she would have had to travel to Salt Lake City, which is much farther away and requires driving through a treacherous mountain pass.\n\n\u201cMedical care costs too much and health insurance as it stands doesn\u2019t address this,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat have we become?\u201d\n\nMs. Wanderlich, who had suffered the brain hemorrhage, was even avoiding preventive care until last month, when she had to get a prescription renewed and her doctor\u2019s office required her to be seen first. Grudgingly, she went for an annual physical exam on Sept. 12. She was relieved to learn that she owed only $30 for the visit; the provider billed her insurer more than $1,200.\n\nWhen the next open enrollment period begins on Nov. 15, Ms. Wanderlich said, she will probably switch to a plan with a narrower network of doctors and a smaller deductible. It will probably mean losing her specialists, she said, but at this point she is resigned.\n\n\u201cA $6,000 deductible \u2014 that\u2019s just staggering,\u201d she said. \u201cI never thought I\u2019d say this, but how many minutes until I get Medicare?\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20141017222629, "twitter": {"description": "Some people enrolled in private coverage through the Affordable Care Act are hesitating to use their insurance because of the high out-of-pocket costs.", "title": "Unable to Meet the Deductible or the Doctor", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/18/us/unable-to-meet-the-deductible-or-the-doctor.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003154254"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/10/18/us/JP-HEALTH/JP-HEALTH-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/18/us/unable-to-meet-the-deductible-or-the-doctor.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003154254", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/18/us/unable-to-meet-the-deductible-or-the-doctor.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "us", "channels": "NytNow", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/us/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Oct. 17, 2014", "edt": "NewYork", "keywords": "Health Insurance and Managed Care,Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010),Preventive Medicine,Emergency Medical Treatment,Drugs (Pharmaceuticals)", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Abby Goodnough and Robert Pear", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/10/18/us/JP-HEALTH/JP-HEALTH-thumbLarge.jpg", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "byl": "By ABBY GOODNOUGH and ROBERT PEAR", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "Some people enrolled in private coverage through the Affordable Care Act are hesitating to use their insurance because of the high out-of-pocket costs.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/10/18/us/JP-HEALTH/JP-HEALTH-thumbStandard.jpg", "description": "Some people enrolled in private coverage through the Affordable Care Act are hesitating to use their insurance because of the high out-of-pocket costs.", "CG": "us", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Oct. 17, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/p/robert_pear/index.html", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/national/index.html", "section": "U.S.", "modified": "2014-10-28", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/us/index.jsonp", "tag": "Drugs (Pharmaceuticals)", "published": "2014-10-17", "section-taxonomy-id": "23FD6C8B-62D5-4CEA-A331-6C2A9A1223BE"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "slug": "18health", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20141028153611, "hdl_p": "Unable to Meet the Deductible or the Doctor", "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/18/us/unable-to-meet-the-deductible-or-the-doctor.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/10/18/us/JP-HEALTH/JP-HEALTH-videoSixteenByNine1050.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Some people enrolled in private coverage through the Affordable Care Act are hesitating to use their insurance because of the high out-of-pocket costs.", "title": "Unable to Meet the Deductible or the Doctor"}, "pdate": 20141017, "des": "Drugs (Pharmaceuticals)", "articleid": 100000003154254, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Unable to Meet the Deductible or the Doctor", "PST": "News"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda22f\"", "article_summary": "Her new insurance has a deductible of $1,000, but primary care visits and prescriptions are not subject to the deductible.\n\u201cA $6,000 deductible \u2014 that\u2019s just staggering,\u201d she said.\nThe typical employer-sponsored health plan would qualify as a gold-level policy under the standards of the Affordable Care Act, Mr. Gabel said.\nA survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that the average deductible for individual coverage in employer-sponsored plans was $1,217 this year.\nBut her deductible was $4,000, she said, and so she avoided going to the doctor even when she got an ear infection over the summer."}
