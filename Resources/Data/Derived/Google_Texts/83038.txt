The Ghana National Fire Service (GNFS) as part of its proactive measures in ensuring safety has inaugurated a rescue team in Accra to help ensure safety on the roads during the yuletide.

This initiative would enable the team to respond fast and efficiently to emergency cases to save lives.

Assistant Chief Fire Officer (ACFO) Ebenezer Simpson, Greater Accra Regional Fire Officer speaking at the inaugural ceremony noted that the operation Road Traffic Collision as well as Search and Rescue Squads in five strategic locations within the region would address the painful situations victims go through in times of accidents.

He added that the team would be positioned at Tema to cover the Motorway, Abelenkpe to cover the N1 and parts of Achimota, Weija to take care of the Mallam and Winneba stretch and Amasaman to take care of the Achimota and Nsawam stretch.

ACFO Simpson said the squads have acquired the required training and skills to handle such emergency situations and the needed recourses to enable them deliver efficiently.

“This is to enable the people access how prepared we are as a service towards emergency situations during this yuletide.”

He said the service do not want incidents to occur before they act hence the need for the intervention on roads to ease casualties.

He advised architects to provide adequate exit points in their works for safety.

Deputy Chief Fire Officer (DCFO) Wynni Azomyann, Director of Finance and Administration, who represented the Chief Fire Officer, said the rescue squad at vantage points would be working 24/7 and have prepared adequately to ensure that accidents and disasters are curtailed.

He said despite the financial constraints the GNFS is making sure that Ghanaians are well protected as far as road accidents and fire fighting are concerned.

DCFO Azomyann urged all to be fire cautious and report fire cases immediately when in small stages before it gets out of hand.

Where lives are threatened the fire service would be there to ensure safety and as such has joined forces with other institutions as far as fire fighting and safety is concerned to make sure this year’s festivities would be accident free.
