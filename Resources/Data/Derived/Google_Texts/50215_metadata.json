Barney Frank said extending the life of the federal agency could be a good way for President Obama and the Democrats to get back in the good graces of corporate elites:\n\nA lot of the business people supported Obama in \u201908 \u2026 and then we really pissed them off mightily with the financial reform bill.\n\nThat measure was dubbed the Dodd-Frank Act after Frank, then a House Democrat from Massachusetts, and cosponsor Chris Dodd, then a Senate Democrat from Connecticut.\n\nNow, though, Republicans will have their own \u201cserious problem\u201d with big business interests, Frank suggested, if they follow the lead of House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., and don\u2019t extend the charter of the Export-Import Bank, which expires Sept. 30.\n\n>>> Commentary: House Highlights Dodd-Frank Deficiencies\n\n\u201cI think this is finally starting to get to the business community now,\u201d Frank said in the interview. \u201cPart of this was the real significance of the defeat of Eric Cantor.\u201d\n\nFrank noted that Cantor, McCarthy\u2019s predecessor in the No. 2 House leadership post, was a supporter of the Ex-Im Bank and had Wall Street connections. The Virginia Republican lost a primary challenge this summer and is leaving Congress.\n\nCantor, Frank said, was one of Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein\u2019s \u201cbest friends in government\u201d and Cantor\u2019s wife \u201cused to work\u201d at Goldman Sachs.\n\n\u201cSome of the \u2026 business guys say, \u2018OK, I don\u2019t agree with [Republicans] on abortion and gay rights, but those aren\u2019t the real issues. Their real issues are the economy.\u2019 \u201d Frank said. He added:\n\nAnd then Cantor loses and now Kevin McCarthy shifts his position on the Export-Import Bank.\n\nBut if McCarthy and conservatives such as Frank\u2019s successor as chairman of the Financial Services Committee, Jeb Hensarling of Texas, succeed in convincing House Republicans to let Ex-Im\u2019s charter expire, the Massachusetts Democrat said, they\u2019ll have \u201ca serious problem\u201d with business leaders aligned with the Chamber of Commerce\u2019s support for the bank.\n\n>>> Hensarling\u2019s Choice: Success Should Depend on Hard Work, Not Friends in Washington\n\nThe 80-year-old agency provides taxpayer-backed loans and loan guarantees to foreign countries and companies to buy U.S. products.\n\nIn the past, liberals argued the bank promotes corporate welfare, but many Democrats \u2014 including President Obama and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts \u2014 now say the agency helps small businesses compete in the global market and creates jobs.\n\nStill, \u201cold guard\u201d liberals such as pioneering consumer advocate Ralph Nader and Rep. Alan Grayson, D-Fla., remain opposed to the bank.\n\nConservatives, meanwhile, argue that Ex-Im furthers corporate welfare and cronyism, as the bank benefits a few big companies such as Boeing, General Electric, and Caterpillar.\n\nMcCarthy, the House\u2019s new No. 2 Republican, surprised many by speaking out in June against the agency, which some critics call the \u201cbank of Boeing.\u201d\n\nFrank co-sponsored the 2012 bill extending the life of Ex-Im, which passed the House with Cantor\u2019s push and was signed by Obama. Now, he says he \u201cwished we lived in a world where there were no export subsidies.\u201d\n\nHe told Huffington Post:\n\nLet me put it this way. If I know that there were [government] subsidies being cut off to Boeing, I would recommend that people buy stock in Airbus. \u2026 As long as other countries subsidize their exports, we would be putting our guys at a competitive disadvantage.\n\nMany business leaders may align with the Republican Party, Frank said, but they are in favor of subsidies such as those provided by Ex-Im and decried by lawmakers such as Hensarling and Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah.\n\n>>> What\u2019s Oprah Got to Do With Opportunity?
