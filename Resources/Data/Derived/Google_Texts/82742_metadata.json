The Broncos currently have just 52 players on their 53-man roster, so Welker could be added immediately once it gets word from the league.\n\nEven if Welker\u2019s four-game suspension is rescinded after he served just one game, it\u2019s unclear whether the Broncos would activate him for their second game Sunday against the Kansas City Chiefs. But all signs point to Welker being ready to play at a moment\u2019s notice. He was cleared from his concussion injury last week by an independent doctor.\n\nThe new drug policy would include first-ever testing for human growth hormone. It would also raise the marijuana levels required for a positive test and shift positive amphetamine or stimulant tests in the offseason from the jurisdiction of the performance-enhancement policy, which penalizes first-time offenders with four-game suspensions, to the substance-abuse policy, where first-time violators are put in the program, but not suspended until a second infraction.\n\nWelker was handed a four-game suspension after the league found he tested positive for an amphetamine. Welker in a statement to The Denver Post that he vigorously disagreed with the league\u2019s finding. His case seemed to serve as a bargaining chip for the league and union to seriously engage in new drug policy negotiations.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Kansas City Chiefs,NFL drug policy,NFLPA,suspensions,Wes Welker", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "First-and-Orange", "description": "The NFL Players Association's 32 team representatives will vote on a revised drug policy on Friday, according to two NFL sources close to negotiations.", "title": "NFL players to vote on drug policy Friday night, source says", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/2014/09/11/source-player-reps-vote-drug-policy-friday/29494/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/files/2014/09/wes-welker-peyton-manning.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "The NFL Players Association's 32 team representatives will vote on a revised drug policy on Friday, according to two NFL sources close to negotiations.", "creator": "@mikeklis", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/2014/09/11/source-player-reps-vote-drug-policy-friday/29494/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/files/2014/09/wes-welker-peyton-manning.jpg", "title": "NFL Players to vote Friday on drug policy, source says; Wes Welker may be reinstated that night", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "The NFL Players Association's 32 team representatives will vote on a revised drug policy on Friday, according to two NFL sources close to negotiations."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde904\"", "article_summary": "The NFL Players Association\u2019s 32 team representatives will vote on a revised drug policy on Friday, according to two NFL sources close to negotiations.\nHis case seemed to serve as a bargaining chip for the league and union to seriously engage in new drug policy negotiations.\nOne source said if the players approve the new policy Friday afternoon, Broncos\u2019 receiver Wes Welker could be among several players reinstated from their suspensions by Friday night.\nThe new drug policy would include first-ever testing for human growth hormone.\nWelker was handed a four-game suspension after the league found he tested positive for an amphetamine."}
