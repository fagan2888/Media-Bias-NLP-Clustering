If it\u2019s good, I\u2019ll vote for it. If it\u2019s bad, I\u2019ll vote against it.\u201d\n\nBarrow\u2019s comment comes two days after his campaign \u2013 and that of his opponent, GOP challenger Rick Allen \u2013 fought back against $2 million worth of attack ads the national Democratic and Republican parties aired for several weeks in Georgia\u2019s 12th Congressional District.\n\nOn Wednesday, Barrow launched a campaign commercial re-assuring voters he\u2019s no Obama booster, while Allen rolled out a TV spot saying partisan attacks against his construction company using insider deals to land lucrative projects are \u201cshameful smears.\u201d\n\nBoth candidates will face off at 3 p.m. today in the race\u2019s first and only scheduled Augusta-area debate at the Evans Government Center. Allen is scheduled to speak to the Rotary Club from noon to 1 p.m. Friday at the Snelling Center on the Augusta Goodwill campus at the corner of Washington and Furys Ferry roads.\n\nMuch of the Rotary Club\u2019s question-and-answer session focused on Barrow facing his first midterm election in a district redrawn by Republicans in 2011 to exclude the Democratic legislator\u2019s Savannah base and replace it with most of GOP-leaning Columbia County. He won re-election in 2012, soundly defeating farmer Lee Anderson.\n\nBarrow estimates the district\u2019s makeup is now 55 percent Republican and 45 percent Democrat.\n\nHe said his fifth re-election campaign remains as competitive as ever, supporting a Public Opinion Strategies poll released Thursday that shows he is well below the 50 percent mark on the ballot in a virtual tie with Allen.\n\nThe survey, which phoned 400 likely general election voters Sept. 15-17, found 44 percent of respondents support Barrow, 42 percent back Allen and 11 percent are undecided.\n\nBarrow said he has been able to beat the odds in the past because he votes for the people, not his party.\n\n\u201cCongress has changed dramatically over the last 30 or 40 years and the most compelling driving force that is making it more partisan is gerrymandering,\u201d Barrow said, referencing the act of drawing a district to favor a certain party.\n\nBarrow said redistricting nationwide has led to a Congress more controlled by legislators who speak from the \u201cextreme wings of the warring parties\u201d and a fear among Americans that dysfunctional representation reflects poorly on them.\n\n\u201cWe are not at all as screwed up as our Congress,\u201d Barrow said. \u201cWe are not really as partisan as a nation as our Congress is.\u201d\n\nBarrow said the brand that is most needed in Congress is \u201cindependent,\u201d somebody who represents the people as a whole and will decide issues on merit, not on which party is proposing, opposing or benefiting.\n\nMembers of the Rotary Club agreed, saying gerrymandering has skewed representation.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very upset of what has happened here,\u201d Superior Court Judge David Roper said of redistricting. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a chance of electing a senator or House representative from our area of Columbia County. It\u2019s not right.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Augusta, georgia, newspaper, classifieds, augusta chronicle news, news, sports, entertainment, local information, masters, golf, masters tournament, local businesses, shopping, daily deals, north augusta, SRS, south carolina, CSRA, aiken, Elections, Government, Metro, Latest News, Wesley Brown", "og": {"site_name": "The Augusta Chronicle", "description": "Rep.
