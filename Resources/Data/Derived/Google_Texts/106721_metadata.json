But the joke is on Benjamin and the film\u2019s creators, because not only are the businessman and his cohort plastic, but so is everyone else in the film, including Benjamin and the drippy young woman he runs off with in the end. All of them exist thanks to celluloid. If not for plastic, there would be no \u201cThe Graduate.\u201d\n\nAlong with plastic, here are some of the other things Mark Miodownik\u2019s new book, \u201cStuff Matters: Exploring the Marvelous Materials That Shape Our Man-made World,\u201d celebrates: concrete, glass, porcelain, paper, graphite (aka pencil lead) and stainless steel. But if all this reminds you overmuch of another tedious shopping expedition to Staples, wait a sec. Before you click away to some story about a feckless celebrity\u2019s Twitter gaffes, know also that \u201cStuff Matters\u201d makes the seemingly banal objects of our everyday lives into an endless source of wonder, dreams and possibility. Miodownik may start out with bricks and coffee mugs, but by the time he\u2019s done, he\u2019s thrilled his readers with invisibility cloaks, bionic human limbs, exploding billiard balls and an elevator to outer space.\n\nMiodownik is a materials scientist and a professor of materials and society at University College of London, which seems a rather unfair hoarding of talents, since he also writes a splendid sentence and communicates the often recondite basics of his discipline with enviable ease. \u201cGold is the full-fat cream of the metal world,\u201d he tosses off at one point. Indeed it is. His description of the small delight of a brown paper bag \u2014 \u201cit comes out first in its flat-pack condition, but then its bottom is pushed out and it makes that glorious sound of thunder as the concertinaed paper sides are deployed into their upright positions\u201d \u2014 is positively Updikean. In the course of this wide-ranging little book, Miodownik becomes a sort of Bill Buford of molecules.\n\n\u201cStuff Matters\u201d also serves as an introduction to the fringes and furtherest reaches of the material world, including its man-made cutting edges. There are probably other books where you can learn that, thanks to the discoveries of deep-sea explorers, scientists have devised a form of living, self-healing concrete containing tiny organisms that excrete calcite, a mineral constituent of concrete, whenever they are exposed to the outside environment. (Good for maintaining inaccessible structures like bridges and the linings of nuclear reactors.) They\u2019ve also devised a \u201ctextile version of concrete\u201d that can be rolled out, arranged and finally dampened to make it assume a rigid form. (Good for slapping up quick shelters in the aftermath of a disaster.) Some new forms of concrete can even be taught to purify air.\n\nStill other writers may tell you how samurai swords came to be \u201cten times stronger and sharper than other swords\u201d or what a raw cocoa bean tastes like or that the pure glass at the center of a decorative scarab found on the mummy of King Tut was incredibly rare in the ancient world and produced by lightning or that the biggest diamond known to humanity is a planet in the constellation of Serpens Cauda and five times the size of Earth.\n\nYou can no doubt find other (if not more bewitching) descriptions of an outlandish substance called aerogel, invented nearly a century ago but still something not many people get the chance to see in person, let alone touch. \u201cThere is no weight to it that you can perceive,\u201d Miodownik writes after holding a block, \u201cand its edges fade away so imperceptibly that it is impossible to see where the material stops and the air begins. Add to this its ghostly blue color and it really is like holding a piece of sky in your hand.\u201d However, I challenge you to find all these and many additional wonders between the covers of a single book. Scientists growing a human windpipe in a laboratory! Graphene, \u201cthe thinnest, strongest, stiffest material in the world,\u201d and so conducive of electricity that it may in time be used to bring the touch-sensitivity of an iPhone screen to \u201cwhole objects and even buildings\u201d!", "article_metadata": {"description": "From living concrete to a lump of sky, the secret marvels of what human beings make", "title": "\u201cStuff Matters\u201d: Unpacking the small, material wonders of everyday life", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "From living concrete to a lump of sky, the secret marvels of what human beings make", "title": "\u201cStuff Matters\u201d: Unpacking the small, material wonders of everyday life", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/05/25/stuff_matters_unpacking_the_small_material_wonders_of_everyday_life/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/05/stuff_matters1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "From living concrete to a lump of sky, the secret marvels of what human beings make", "title": "\u201cStuff Matters\u201d: Unpacking the small, material wonders of everyday life", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/05/stuff_matters1.jpg", "creator": "@magiciansbook", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Laura Miller", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Books, Chemistry, Editor's Picks, Mark Miodownik, Must-Do, Nonfiction, Physics, Science, Stuff Matters, What to Read", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "\u201cStuff Matters\u201d also serves as an introduction to the fringes and furtherest reaches of the material world, including its man-made cutting edges.\nBefore you click away to some story about a feckless celebrity\u2019s Twitter gaffes, know also that \u201cStuff Matters\u201d makes the seemingly banal objects of our everyday lives into an endless source of wonder, dreams and possibility.\nBut if all this reminds you overmuch of another tedious shopping expedition to Staples, wait a sec.\nIn the course of this wide-ranging little book, Miodownik becomes a sort of Bill Buford of molecules.\nThey\u2019ve also devised a \u201ctextile version of concrete\u201d that can be rolled out, arranged and finally dampened to make it assume a rigid form."}
