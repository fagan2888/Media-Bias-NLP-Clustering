When and if it does, there\u2019s nothing in the current laws to suggest that it could ever be done on an involuntary basis. However, an expert opinion \u2014 that is, the opinion of an expert in RFID technology, not specifically in the field of microchipping humans \u2014 that is currently circulating has parents in fear. For some of these parents, the fear isn\u2019t a loss of privacy, or a risk of a medical reaction to the device \u2014 it\u2019s of the end times.\n\nThe book of Revelation warned of the \u201cmark of the beast,\u201d and Tim LaHaye\u2019s Left Behind series made it a narrative and cinematic reality for millions of readers and viewers. Before and since, many have speculated about what exactly this \u201cmark\u201d might be \u2014 what it would look like, and how it would be made. A tattooed bar code, readable by a machine, was a popular theory for a while. Since microchipping animals has become common, however, some have speculated that this would be the mark.\n\nIn fact, a 2012 rumor warned that the Affordable Care Act would require microchipping of all patients, and set off an Anti-Christ scare. Snopes thoroughly debunked that \u2014 it was not about microchipping, but about registering medical devices such as pacemakers. There was another story later, a hoax that scared many, claiming the government was microchipping people via the ebola vaccine.\n\nWhat about microchipping kids, though, in order to find lost children as easily as finding a lost dog? Well, according to 13 News Now, one expert thinks that it is coming soon. Stewart Lipoff, an electronics engineer and RFID expert, says microchipping humans with chips similar to those in electronic devices isn\u2019t a reality yet, but he thinks it could be done soon.\n\nIn his hypothetical, doorways could be equipped with RFID readers, making it easy to track people \u2014 such as a kid who has been snatched.\n\nIs it realistic, though? First, there would be medical consent and privacy issues for a kid that simply aren\u2019t a part of microchipping a dog. Second, even Lipoff admits that these chips can\u2019t currently be tracked in the way he\u2019s describing.\n\nStill, the notion has people worried, for religious reasons as well as medical and privacy-related ones. On Twitter, it\u2019s easy to see that for many, this is the end the Bible predicted.\n\nTracking kids via Microchip \u2018can\u2019t be far off,\u2019 says expert http://t.co/HyJdezE1Vv Neither Is Anti-Christ n Jesus Will Return To Rule All \u2014 Great Danes \uf8ff (@bigBucksCo) May 9, 2015\n\nTracking kids via microchip \u2018can\u2019t be far off,\u2019 says expert http://t.co/zThezV9YGw via @kens5 \u201cMark of the Beast\u201d tech here-now!

If you\u2019re hearing this particular \u201cexpert opinion\u201d and reading the sign of the beast in it, take a deep breath \u2014 you probably have nothing to fear.\n\n[Photo by: Scott Olson/Getty Images]", "article_metadata": {"description": "An RFID expert's prediction that we'll soon be microchipping kids had parents worried -- that this may be the Mark of the Beast as described in Revelation.", "og": {"site_name": "The Inquisitr News", "description": "An RFID expert\u2019s prediction that we\u2019ll soon be microchipping kids had parents worried \u2014 that this may be the Mark of the Beast as described in Revelation.", "title": "Expert\u2019s Prediction Of Microchipping Kids Provokes Anti-Christ Fears", "url": "http://www.inquisitr.com/2076689/expert-prediction-of-microchipping-kids-provokes-fears-of-antichrist/", "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/microchipping-kids-has-parents-fearing-mark-of-beast.jpg", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-09T00:04:29+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-09T00:31:44+00:00"}, "type": "article"}, "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/microchipping-kids-has-parents-fearing-mark-of-beast.jpg", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ed1c24", "datePublished": "2015-05-09T00:04:29+00:00", "fb": {"pages": 71179904752, "app_id": 164157850314499}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/assets/0cec37/dist/images/logos/inq-win.png", "keywords": "obamacare,mark of the beast,microchips,rfid,technology", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "y_key": "f282393706a5fd85", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/microchipping-kids-has-parents-fearing-mark-of-beast.jpg", "height": 409, "width": 670}, "site": "@theinquisitr", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "An RFID expert\u2019s prediction that we\u2019ll soon be microchipping kids had parents worried \u2014 that this may be the Mark of the Beast as described in Revelation."}, "viewport": "width=980"}, "article_summary": "What about microchipping kids, though, in order to find lost children as easily as finding a lost dog?\nIt\u2019s unlikely anyone will be easing parental duties by microchipping kids anytime soon \u2014 and it may never happen.\nFirst, there would be medical consent and privacy issues for a kid that simply aren\u2019t a part of microchipping a dog.\nIn fact, a 2012 rumor warned that the Affordable Care Act would require microchipping of all patients, and set off an Anti-Christ scare.\nRead Rev 13 \u2014 Izzy (@izzyt84) May 8, 2015Tracking kids via microchip \u2018can\u2019t be far off,\u2019 says expert \u2013 *Rev."}
