Some studies have shown that bivalirudin is a safer option than the longtime standard option, heparin. Bivalirudin, however, costs about 400 times more than heparin.\n\n\"Which trial to believe is controversial and not entirely clear,\" said Dr. Peter Berger, senior vice president for clinical research at the North Shore-LIJ Health System, in a press release. \"But nearly everyone agrees that if the more expensive blood thinner is not safer or better in some way, the less expensive one ought to be used.\"\n\nThe most recent study on the drugs, Minimizing Adverse Hemorrhagic Events by Transradial Access Site and Systemic Implementation of Angiox, or MATRIX, is published in the New England Journal of Medicine. Researchers recruited 8,404 patients at 78 medical centers in Europe who were undergoing stent placement.\n\nThe three-trial study sought to find which drug was more effective for patient outcome, whether continuing to give bivalirudin to patients 4 to 6 hours after surgery was beneficial, and how each effected arterial access for surgeons placing stents.\n\nThe researchers reported negligible differences in the benefits of the two drugs in all three cases, although lower doses of heparin were found to be safer and effective, especially when paired with a glycoprotein inhibitor.\n\nIn an editorial by Berger that is also published in the New England Journal of Medicine alongside the MATRIX study results, he suggests studies that more evenly test the effects of the two drugs -- including more accurately measuring, and explaining, the use of glycoprotein inhibitors -- are necessary to determine whether one drug truly has benefits over the other.\n\n\"Many studies raise more questions than they answer,\" Berger said. \"It will be interesting to see whether doctors accept the results of the MATRIX Trial or wait for more studies before deciding which blood thinner they prefer.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "Conflicting studies on the blood-thinning drugs heparin and bivalirudin show them to have no clear benefit over one another aside from one being more expensive.", "og": {"site_name": "UPI", "description": "Conflicting studies on the blood-thinning drugs heparin and bivalirudin show them to have no clear benefit over one another aside from one being more expensive.", "title": "Expensive blood thinner no more effective than cheaper drug", "url": "http://www.upi.com/Health_News/2015/09/02/Expensive-blood-thinner-no-more-effective-than-cheaper-drug/7811441200221/", "image": "http://cdnph.upi.com/sv/ph/og/i/7811441200221/2015/1/14412066982452/v2.1/Expensive-blood-thinner-no-more-effective-than-cheaper-drug.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/7811441200221/2015/i/14412066982452/v2.1/Expensive-blood-thinner-no-more-effective-than-cheaper-drug.jpg?lg=4", "description": "Conflicting studies on the blood-thinning drugs heparin and bivalirudin show them to have no clear benefit over one another aside from one being more expensive.", "site": "@UPI", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Expensive blood thinner no more effective than cheaper drug"}, "fb": {"app_id": 130795020312660}, "keywords": "Health", "google-site-verification": "vnkcuJA1Q89cLmy4OZpuQKOf5Jf6ny_RVh7BpxZ11a0", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Health"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddb86\"", "article_summary": "\"But nearly everyone agrees that if the more expensive blood thinner is not safer or better in some way, the less expensive one ought to be used.\"\nBlood thinners are used during the placement of cardiac stents, mesh-like cages inserted into narrowed arteries to restore proper blood flow, to prevent blood clots during angioplasty procedures.\n\"It will be interesting to see whether doctors accept the results of the MATRIX Trial or wait for more studies before deciding which blood thinner they prefer.\"\nSome studies have shown that bivalirudin is a safer option than the longtime standard option, heparin.\nResearchers recruited 8,404 patients at 78 medical centers in Europe who were undergoing stent placement."}
