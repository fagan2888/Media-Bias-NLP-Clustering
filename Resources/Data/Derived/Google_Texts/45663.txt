Interview with Tasha Maty and Holly Fasold, owners

Q: How did you get involved in this business?

A: We have been in the fashion industry for several years and decided to branch out on our own.

Q: What distinguishes you from other businesses in your category?

A: We have been the first ones around to offer quality merchandise to our customers along with a very personalized shopping experience. Eighty percent of our merchandise is under $100. We travel extensively around the world looking for unique and affordable styles for our customers. We do not buy anything online as we want to guarantee and feel the quality of merchandise we purchase.

Q: What do you like best about your line of work?

A: Helping people feel good about themselves. We are so excited when our customers are so happy walking out the door with their new clothing. We will not let anybody leave without loving their purchase. We love the whole aspect about being personal shoppers and pride ourselves in taking it to the next level with our customers.

Q: What is your businessâ€™ biggest challenge?

A: Letting people know our locations. We rely on word of mouth from our customers and we have done exceptionally well.

Q: Something people might be surprised to learn about you or your business:

A: We pride ourselves in buying very limited quantities in any given styles to guarantee our customers will not see themselves walking down the street. Our extensive vendor list from all over the world guarantees that aspect for our customers.
