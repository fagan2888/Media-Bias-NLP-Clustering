More than half of those surveyed \u2014 54 percent \u2014 \u201cstrongly\u201d favor a label.\n\nOverall support crossed party lines. \u201cYou see bipartisan support, although different levels of support,\u201d said Mark DiCamillo, Field Poll director. Eighty-six percent of Democrats supported a label with 12 percent opposed; among Republicans, 60 percent supported and 37 percent opposed.\n\nThis is the second Field Poll in two years on the question, with a slight increase over the 2014 results showing 74 percent support.\n\nRegistered voters across the state were asked about their support for a warning stating: \u201cStudies show that daily consumption of soda and other sugary drinks contributes to diabetes, obesity and tooth decay.\u201d\n\nThe poll was commissioned by The California Endowment and the California Center for Public Health Advocacy. CCPHA executive director Harold Goldstein said he was \u201cheartened\u201d that even more voters support a warning label now than two years ago.\n\n\u201cWhat it means to us is voters in California want to know the scientific truth about the harmful effects of these sugary drinks,\u201d Goldstein said, \u201cand they want that information right there on the front of cans and bottles.\u201d\n\nSupport was especially strong among Latino voters with 85 percent in favor and 13 percent opposed. Even among Latino Republican voters, support ran to 74 percent.\n\n\u201cThere is not a single subgroup within Latino voting populations that opposes warning labels, at least that we could identify,\u201d said DiCamillo. Latinos make up 23 percent of the state\u2019s registered voters overall, he said, and \u201care a growing subgroup.\u201d\n\nLast year, the California Legislature considered a bill that would require a warning label on beverages with added sweeteners that exceeded 75 calories in 12 ounces. The bill stalled in the Senate Health committee when four members who were present at the hearing abstained from voting.\n\nIn a statement Bob Achermann, executive director of CalBev, an industry group, said labels about calories and ingredients are already available and that a warning suggesting sugary beverages are a unique driver of obesity and diabetes would mislead people.\n\n\u201cThe best way to promote balanced lifestyles is through fact-based information,\u201d Achermann said, \u201crather than simplistic approaches that target just one product but don\u2019t ultimately address complex health challenges.\u201d\n\nNumerous business groups have also voiced their opposition to warning labels.\n\nThe poll included two questions that asked respondents to select which of three beverages (a 12-ounce can) had the most sugar:\n\nCoke (39 grams)\n\nMinute Maid Lemonade (40 grams)\n\nHawaiian Punch (21 grams)\n\nOnly 7 percent of respondents correctly said the can of Minute Maid had the most sugar. In addition, 34 percent said Hawaiian Punch had the most sugar, even though it has about half the sugar content of Coke or Minute Maid Lemonade.\n\nIn the second question, people picked from:\n\nO.N.E. Mango Coconut Water (30 grams)\n\nGlaceau Orange Mango FruitWater (0 grams)\n\nHonest Lemon Tea (21 grams)\n\nOnly 14 percent of people correctly picked the coconut water. Fully one-third of respondents \u2014 33 percent \u2014 said the Glaceau FruitWater had the most sugar, even though it is a sugar-free drink; 32 percent picked the Honest Lemon Tea.\n\nGoldstein, the public health advocate, said that marketers are \u201cpurposely confusing consumers\u201d by using words like \u201chonest\u201d in the names of their products.\n\n\u201cOne of the great benefits of a warning label is consumers will no longer be confused,\u201d he said. When they\u2019re grocery shopping, they don\u2019t have to \u201cwonder which (beverages) are harmful and which ones are not.\u201d\n\nWhen asked why they supported warning labels, 28.6 percent of respondents said that they would promote \u201cgreater personal responsibility\u201d in helping people cut their sugar consumption, while 28 percent said consumers have a \u201cright to know the truth\u201d about harmful products. Another 21 percent said parents would be able to make more informed beverage choices for their children.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Nearly 80 percent of voters polled approve of a warning label on sugar-sweetened beverages, and that support was bipartisan.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Californians Overwhelmingly Support Soda Warning Labels, Poll Shows\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2016\\/01\\/13\\/californians-support-a-soda-warning-label-field-poll-shows\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2016-01-13 00:01:05\",\"mod_date\":\"2016-01-13 16:52:34\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":138239,\"author_id\":\"240\",\"author_name\":\"Lisa Aliferis\",\"author_display_name\":\"Lisa Aliferis\",\"tags\":[\"News\",\"Soda Warning Label\",\"Sugar-Sweetend Beverages\"],\"categories\":[\"Policy\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2016\\/01\\/2474643298_e77c48e85a_o-e1452669578137.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "Nearly 80 percent of voters polled approve of a warning label on sugar-sweetened beverages, and that support was bipartisan.", "title": "Californians Overwhelmingly Support Soda Warning Labels, Poll Shows", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2016/01/13/californians-support-a-soda-warning-label-field-poll-shows/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2016/01/2474643298_e77c48e85a_o-1440x960.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "news,soda warning label,sugar-sweetend beverages", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "CCPHA executive director Harold Goldstein said he was \u201cheartened\u201d that even more voters support a warning label now than two years ago.\n\u201cOne of the great benefits of a warning label is consumers will no longer be confused,\u201d he said.\nNearly four out of five registered voters \u2014 78 percent \u2014 support a warning label on sugary beverages, according to a statewide Field Poll released Wednesday.\n\u201cYou see bipartisan support, although different levels of support,\u201d said Mark DiCamillo, Field Poll director.\nEven among Latino Republican voters, support ran to 74 percent."}
