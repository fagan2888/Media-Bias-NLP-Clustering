(WYFF) A South Carolina mother says a tow truck driver refused to help her disabled daughter because she supports Bernie Sanders.

Kelle McWade’s 25-year-old daughter was in an accident on I-26 in Asheville. She said their longtime family mechanic sent Ken Shupe, the owner of Shupee Max in Travelers Rest, to help her, because he couldn’t get there fast enough.

“When he got up there, he put his truck in the position to have it pulled up, pulled the chains down, went around the back, saw the sticker on the back of her car and the sign in her back window, came back and said, ‘I can’t tow you.’ She said, ‘Why? Is there something wrong with the car?’ He said, ‘No, you’re a Bernie supporter.’ She said, ‘What, are you serious?’ Needless to say she was in shock. Her jaw just dropped,” McWade said.

McWade’s daughter suffers from psoriatic arthritis, fibromyalgia, early stage Crohn’s disease and ankylosing spondylitis, which means her spine is in the process of fusing. She has to take multiple medications and supplements, according to WYFF.
