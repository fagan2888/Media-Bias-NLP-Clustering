Scott Applewhite / AP Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, center, and other GOP leaders speaks with reporters on Capitol Hill in Washington, Tuesday, July 30, 2013, after a GOP strategy session.\n\nRob Portman is big on green. the Republican Senator from Ohio owns three hybrid vehicles, including a Chevy pickup and the 2006 Ford Escape his daughter took to college. His home outside Cincinnati is LEED-certified, with floors of reclaimed wood, special foam insulation and a geothermal heating and cooling system. He is even a graduate of Dartmouth College, whose nickname is the Big Green.\n\nSo it is ironic that when Portman began to shepherd a long-overdue energy bill through the Senate, his mantra was Go small. \u201cIt\u2019s not the biggest bill in the world,\u201d the mild-mannered Republican says as he tosses a football with an aide in his Washington Senate office. \u201cBut it is a model of how we can work through the system on a bipartisan basis and make important progress.\u201d\n\nUnder President George W. Bush, Congress passed a pair of sweeping energy overhauls, mostly offering oil and gas companies fresh tax breaks. Barack Obama\u2019s first term, in turn, was marked by nasty spats over energy policy, including a controversial stimulus with billions in new green investment and a cap-and-trade bill that was torpedoed by GOP opposition. To avoid a repeat, Portman and his Democratic partner, Senator Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, opted for a different approach.\n\n(MORE: Grid Politics)\n\nTheir bill is crafted to skirt controversy. It has no mandates. It doesn\u2019t add to the deficit. It has been stripped of contentious provisions, including a federal loan program for commercial buildings and another aimed at boosting the government\u2019s use of green vehicles.\n\nThe search for an energy consensus reflects unexpected new realities for both the carbon-based- and renewable-energy industries. The Solyndra solar debacle spoiled the market for green subsidies, which liberals love. Meanwhile, booming domestic production has eased the political pressure to find new sources of oil at home. As Shaheen puts it, \u201cWe\u2019ve tried to craft the bill in a way that will actually allow it to get through.\u201d\n\nWhich is why the measure focuses on efficiency at a time when the U.S. wastes more energy than Japan produces in a year. It would create new efficiency codes for residential and commercial construction, offer incentives to states to meet them, provide worker training and require the federal government to adopt energy-saving techniques. \u201cI think a lot of conservatives believe that this is an area where as a country we can do a lot more,\u201d Portman says.\n\nAnd while the bill may be modest in scope, supporters say its impact would be significant. A recent study by the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy found that the legislation and a bundle of likely amendments could save consumers and businesses up to $65 billion through reduced energy costs and create 174,000 jobs by 2030. \u201cSure, we would love to see this bill do more. That\u2019s always the case,\u201d says Suzanne Watson, the group\u2019s policy director. \u201cBut it is a first step after a long time.\u201d\n\n(MORE: A Bump on the Road to Green)\n\nThis being Congress, even relatively simple legislation attracts conflict. No sooner had the measure hit the floor of the Senate than it stalled. Louisiana Republican David Vitter held up debate over his demand for an unrelated vote on Obamacare. Other Senators are trying to add provisions that advance the prospects of the long-suffering (and still in limbo) Keystone XL pipeline, which environmentalists oppose.\n\nProspects are dimmer in the House. Tea Party Republicans remain leery of any government meddling in what they see as the private marketplace. \u201cOur job is to make them understand that this is not the role of government,\u201d says Nicolas Loris, an economic policy analyst at the Heritage Foundation, whose advocacy arm is one of several influential conservative groups urging members to oppose the Shaheen-Portman approach.\n\nStill, Portman thinks he has a shot to get the scaled-down bill to the President\u2019s desk by the end of the year. If he\u2019s right, it will be a sign that Congress can do something useful on energy even if the appetite for sweeping change has eased for now. \u201cWe have consensus,\u201d Portman says. \u201cLet\u2019s make progress where we can.\u201d\n\nMORE: 1 Billion Live Without Electric Light", "article_metadata": {"description": "Rob Portman is big on green. the Republican Senator from Ohio owns three hybrid vehicles, including a Chevy pickup and the 2006 Ford Escape his daughter took to college.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "After years of squabbling, can Washington declare a truce on energy policy?", "title": "A Paler Shade of Green | TIME.com", "url": "http://business.time.com/2013/09/19/a-paler-shade-of-green/", "image": "https://timebusinessblog.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/1500_bportman_0930.jpg?w=600", "type": "article"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "The latest news and commentary on the economy, the markets, and business", "fb": {"admins": "1124331582,512158401,808970553,100000018008769", "app_id": 53177223193}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "application-name": "Business & Money", "google-site-verification": "RuBIxOwStTsi-KOuQpMhdd-F4UmaxCoOJAOJ8D2hh8Y", "keywords": "new energy,", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/time"}, "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://business.time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/d8fe9c72e6ddb8decc694e4fdd84f015?s=16", "news_keywords": "new energy,"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0a09\"", "article_summary": "So it is ironic that when Portman began to shepherd a long-overdue energy bill through the Senate, his mantra was Go small.\nHe is even a graduate of Dartmouth College, whose nickname is the Big Green.\nBarack Obama\u2019s first term, in turn, was marked by nasty spats over energy policy, including a controversial stimulus with billions in new green investment and a cap-and-trade bill that was torpedoed by GOP opposition.\nRob Portman is big on green.\nIt has been stripped of contentious provisions, including a federal loan program for commercial buildings and another aimed at boosting the government\u2019s use of green vehicles."}
