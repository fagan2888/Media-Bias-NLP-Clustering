The Affordable Care Act has enabled more than 16.4 million Americans to receive healthcare coverage. Advancements in technology improve both diagnoses and treatment quality. Retail health offers a convenience used by more than 10 million patients at 1,800 retail health locations. Along with the current challenges facing the healthcare system, such as an aging population, increased patient volume and physician shortages, these changes prompt the expansion of the traditional role of a nurse.\n\nGenerally, Americans believe nurses\u2019 roles are expanding as they share increased responsibilities to support the delivery of high quality healthcare, according to a poll commissioned by University of Phoenix College of Health Professions. The survey also found that adults in the United States view their experience with nurses as overwhelmingly positive. In fact, 95 percent found nurses to be a valuable addition to the healthcare system as a whole, and 87 percent view nurses as trusted sources of health information.", "article_metadata": {"vf": {"unique_id": "reviewjournal-nid-2078641"}, "twitter": {"description": "Changes in the healthcare system affect what employers are looking for in nursing candidates.", "title": "What employers look for in the 21st century nurse", "url": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/sponsored-content/what-employers-look-the-21st-century-nurse", "image": {"src": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/20177309_web.jpg"}, "creator": {"identifier": "@reviewjournal", "id": 15358759}, "card": "summary"}, "al": {"web": {"should_fallback": "true"}, "android": {"url": "review-journal://?eid=8090050205", "app_name": "review-journal", "package": "com.LVRJ"}, "ios": {"url": "review-journal://?eid=8090050205", "app_store_id": 540820524, "app_name": "review-journal"}}, "google-play-app": "app-id=com.LVRJ", "parsely-author": "(BPT)", "parsely-section": "Sponsored Content", "keywords": "Sponsored Content,,", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-08-18T11:03:01Z", "parsely-link": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/sponsored-content/what-employers-look-the-21st-century-nurse", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "(BPT)", "parsely-title": "What employers look for in the 21st century nurse", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1098299519", "Googlebot-News": "noindex, nofollow", "description": "Changes in the healthcare system affect what employers are looking for in nursing candidates.", "fb": {"admins": 630759385, "app_id": 195491203833571}, "parsely-type": "post", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-18T04:03:01-07:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=0.9", "og": {"site_name": "Las Vegas Review-Journal", "description": "Changes in the healthcare system affect what employers are looking for in nursing candidates.", "title": "What employers look for in the 21st century nurse", "url": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/sponsored-content/what-employers-look-the-21st-century-nurse", "image": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/20177309_web.jpg", "type": "article"}, "parsely-tags": "Sponsored Content", "parsely-image-url": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/20177309_web.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd252\"", "article_summary": "Retail health offers a convenience used by more than 10 million patients at 1,800 retail health locations.\nIn fact, 95 percent found nurses to be a valuable addition to the healthcare system as a whole, and 87 percent view nurses as trusted sources of health information.\nAlong with the current challenges facing the healthcare system, such as an aging population, increased patient volume and physician shortages, these changes prompt the expansion of the traditional role of a nurse.\n(BPT) - Over the last decade, a number of changes have transformed the healthcare industry.\nThe survey also found that adults in the United States view their experience with nurses as overwhelmingly positive."}
