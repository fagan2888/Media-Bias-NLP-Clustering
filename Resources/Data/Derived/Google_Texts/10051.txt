The Wainwright Liberty Ship Exhibit at the Historical Society Of Bay County Museum was loaned a very special item to add to it's collection Saturday morning.

In 1944, Jeannette Brown-Godfrey participated in a ship launching as the flower girl for the S.S Nick Stoner Ship, during that time her family was nominated to christen the ship.

Each flower girl was given a gold bracelet for memorabilia which Brown-Godfrey kept for more than 70 years.

That bracelet along with an original champagne bottle known as the "Dead Solider" used in the christening will be on display at the museum.

"It is a part of the community," said Brown-GodFrey who grew up in Panama City. "It was a part of the activities going on at the time and Wainwright was an important part of Panama City and it was a war effort, Panama City was very patriotic."

Brown-Godfrey traveled with her daughter and Granddaughter to the Bay County Museum Saturday to drop off the bracelet.

Brown-Godfrey currently lives in Mississippi.
