Any hope of having peace in the Middle East is dependent on a long term deal between Israel and Palestine.\u201d\n\nPHOTOS: The Queen Of Mean: 15 Times Michelle Obama Was A Very Angry First Lady \u2014 Tantrums, Feuds, Fights & More!\n\nIn addition, \u201cBill pointed out how Obama has refused to go to the border in Texas to see the immigration humanitarian crisis firsthand, choosing instead to attend several fundraisers in the Lone Star state,\u201d the source revealed.\n\nClinton also takes aim at Obama\u2019s key aide, senior adviser Valerie Jarrett, according to the insider.\n\n\u201cObama has credited Jarrett with demanding that free birth control for women be part of the Affordable Care Act. This became a rallying point for conservatives, which Clinton said Obama should have anticipated,\u201d the source continued. \u201cThere is no other free medication given to anyone, and women covered by ACA could certainly afford to pay a small co-pay. Why hand this hot button issue to the Republicans on a platter?\u201d\n\n\u201cBill has tried to give advice to Obama in the past, but it falls on deaf ears,\u201d said the source. \u201cIn Bill\u2019s opinion, Obama is just riding out his term, and only cared about getting healthcare passed. It\u2019s going to make it very hard for Hillary to have any chances of winning, because Obama has made such a mess of things.\u201d\n\nPHOTOS: President Obama Through The Years\n\nAs Radar previously reported, Bill Clinton recently told Florida Democratic gubernatorial candidate Charlie Crist that his alliance with Obama would hurt his chances for re-election.\n\nClinton privately told Charlie at the event that he wouldn\u2019t be any endorsing anyone until after the primary,\u201d an insider revealed. \u201cHe also warned Charlie that his close relationship with Barack could hurt his chances, because he is political poison.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was very apparent to everyone in Charlie\u2019s camp that Bill had a major problem with his close ties to Obama,\u201d the source continued, explaining that \u201cA majority of Charlie\u2019s campaign staff are Obama acolytes, including former campaign manager Jim Messina.\u201d\n\nDespite being chosen by President Obama to be Secretary of State, don\u2019t expect \u201cHillary to ask Obama to campaign for her once she decides to run,\u201d the source reveals. \u201cIn fact, Bill has been strategizing on ways Hillary can distance herself from the Obama administration. The Clintons will have no problem throwing Obama under the bus if that is what it will take to win.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://i0.wp.com/radaronline.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/bill-clinton-tells-friends-obama-sabotaging-hillary-chance-become-next-president-pp-sl.jpg?fit=50%2C50", "description": "RadarOnline.com has learned that Bill Clinton has already been complaining about how he feels the President has been treating his wife.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "p": {"domain_verify": "57308aa914ffad6d8f01b012ce894b31"}, "og": {"site_name": "Radar Online", "description": "With rumors swirling that Barack Obama has promised his support to projected Hillary Clinton challenger Elizabeth Warren for the 2016 presidential race, RadarOnline.com has learned that Bill Clinto...", "title": "O No He Didn\u2019t!
