It added: \"The governor must execute laws, not sabotage them.\"\n\nA spokesman for the courts could not immediately be reached.\n\nWolf spokesman Jeff Sheridan said the governor had no immediate comment but would soon be \"responding to the filing.\" Wolf in February imposed a moratorium on executions until he receives the report of a task force studying the future of capital punishment, unleashing a new round of praise and criticism. At the time, 183 men and women were on death row, confined to their cells 23 hours a day.\n\nMichael, of Lemoyne, Cumberland County, was awaiting execution for the 1993 kidnapping of Krista Eng, 16. His death warrant has been signed four times.\n\nAnother convict spared by Wolf's moratorium is Terrance Williams, 48, a former star quarterback at Germantown High School sentenced to death for the 1984 murder of Amos Norwood, a 56-year-old Germantown church volunteer. He was to be executed in March.\n\nKane's brief asked the high court for \"extraordinary relief,\" arguing Wolf only has constitutional power to issue reprieves of specific sentences - not an entire class of sentences - and under certain circumstances can grant a commutation or pardon.\n\nReprieves, she argued, are meant to be temporary - usually to allow inmates to pursue legal remedies. When Wolf announced his moratorium, he wrote that he would lift it after seeing the report's recommendations and after \"all concerns are addressed satisfactorily.\"\n\n\"What constitutes the point at which 'all concerns are addressed satisfactorily?' What are the concerns? Who is going to determine whether and when they are satisfactorily addressed?\" said the filing, signed by Lawrence M. Cherba, who heads the office's criminal division, and Amy Zapp, who oversees the appeals section.\n\n\"In law and in reality, the governor . . . seeks to replace judicial review of capital sentencing with his own review based on his own personal standard of satisfaction, namely an infallible judicial process that can never be attained,\" it argued. \"Such a roadblock to death-sentence executions is impermissible.\"\n\nacouloumbis@phillynews.com\n\n717-787-5934@AngelasInk", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "news", "og": {"url": "http://articles.philly.com/2015-07-10/news/64245425_1_wolf-capital-sentencing-moratorium", "site_name": "philly-archives", "type": "article", "description": "HARRISBURG - Calling Gov.
