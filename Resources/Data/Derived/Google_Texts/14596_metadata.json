Now, students applying for federal and state financial aid can feel the effects of the government\u2019s mistake, too.\n\nThe IRS announced last month that close to 1 million HealthCare.gov customers received the wrong information on 1095-A forms, which are needed to file taxes. The error is causing delays in their ability to file returns and receive refunds.\n\nThose delays could affect students filling out Free Applications for Federal Student Aid (FAFSAs), as the current year\u2019s tax returns are needed to apply for and receive financial assistance from the federal government.\n\n\u201cI am in a huge mess,\u201d a commenter on the blog for TaxAct, a free tax preparer, wrote late last month. \u201cI have to get the taxes done so i [sic] can get the FAFSA rolling before the deadline. Indirectly, one form is messing with my whole life.\u201d\n\nAccording to the post, the user selected an insurance plan in Maryland and was told her 1095-A form was sent Jan. 31. By Feb. 24, however, the commenter still hadn\u2019t received the form.\n\n\u201cThis thing is all having a cascading effect,\u201d Ed Haislmaier, a health policy expert at The Heritage Foundation, told The Daily Signal.\n\n\u201cThis thing is all having a cascading effect,\u201d said Heritage Foundation health policy expert Ed Haislmaier.\n\nProblems With 1095-A Forms\n\nOne of the major aspects of the Affordable Care Act touted by the law\u2019s proponents and the Obama administration is the ability for consumers to receive subsidies.\n\nThose who did so must reconcile their tax credits.\n\nTo determine how much recipients may owe or receive from the IRS, the state and federal health insurance exchanges provide them with a 1095-A form, which includes the cost of the second lowest silver plan in their area\u2014which is used in calculating the subsidies\u2014and how much they actually received each month.\n\nThough the majority of filers who earned subsidies were sent the correct 1095-A form, the Internal Revenue Service announced last month that 800,000 HealthCare.gov customers received the wrong information on the document.\n\nIn California, which operates its own exchange, 100,000 consumers also received 1095-A forms with erroneous information.\n\nTo remedy the issue, government officials requested those affected delay filing their tax returns. For the estimated 50,000 who already did so, the Department of Treasury announced last month those individuals would not have to amend their returns.\n\n>>> Commentary: Why We\u2019re Still Talking About Obamacare\n\nThe FAFSA\n\nTo fill out a FAFSA, students need either the current year or previous year\u2019s tax return, among other documents, Karen McCarthy, senior policy analyst at the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators, told The Daily Signal. And though students have the ability to fill out the application using estimations of data on their returns for this year, the FAFSA will have to be amended in the future.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s generally a little more straight forward and easier if you\u2019ve already filed your return,\u201d McCarthy said.\n\nShortly after April 15, the Department of Education will reach out to applicants who filed FAFSAs without the current year\u2019s tax return and asks them to update their information.\n\nWhether the delay in the information impacts the aid students can receive depends on the institution, as some financial assistance is awarded on a first-come, first-served basis.\n\nMcCarthy specifically pointed to Pell Grants and student loans as aid packages that are available to students regardless of when they apply. By contrast, others like supplemental grant programs, federal work study, and institutional and state aid have \u201climited dollars.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome funds run out earlier in the process, and when they\u2019re gone, they\u2019re gone,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cSome funds run out earlier in the process, and when they\u2019re gone, they\u2019re gone,\u201d said Karen McCarthy.\n\nFor some students, colleges request a federal tax transcript\u2014which includes tax return information\u2014from the IRS in addition to what\u2019s provided on a FAFSA. The tax transcript serves as a way for schools to ensure that the data on the FAFSA matches what\u2019s on the applicants\u2019 tax returns, McCarthy said.\n\nEach year, the Department of Education selects roughly 30 percent of FAFSA applicants for verification, in which tax transcripts are requested, she said. Some applicants are randomly selected, and others are flagged because of inconsistent answers on the form.\n\nIn addition, individual institutions also select applications for verification, which can include the whole pool of hopeful students.\n\nIf there\u2019s a delay in filing tax returns and a tax transcript from the IRS is requested, there could be issues with students receiving their aid.\n\nIn an email to The Daily Signal, Mark Kantrowitz, senior vice president and publisher of Edvisors.com, said delays in filing tax returns wouldn\u2019t derail a student\u2019s eligibility for aid. However, he did say that it could lead to a lag in when students receive their financial aid.\n\n>>> The Government Gave Close to 1 Million HealthCare.gov Customers the Wrong Tax Information. Here\u2019s Why That Matters.\n\nApproaching Deadlines\n\nThe IRS hasn\u2019t yet said if the correct 1095-A forms were sent to those who received the wrong information, and the deadline to file returns\u2014April 15\u2014is quickly approaching.\n\nFor students filing FAFSAs, though, deadlines aren\u2019t as concrete.\n\nThe federal government requires those requesting aid for the 2015-2016 school year to complete their forms by June 30, 2016. But the Department of Education encourages students to apply as early as possible, as aid is limited.\n\nThough students have more than a year to complete the form according to the federal deadline, states and individual colleges set their own, which range from Feb. 15 to June 30. States like Washington, North Carolina and Kentucky encourage students to submit their FAFSAs as close to Jan. 1, 2015 as possible. Others like Montana and Maryland had a March 1 deadline, while South Carolina and New Jersey require students to submit their FAFSAs by June.\n\nA spokesman for the Department of Education told The Daily Signal the agency hasn\u2019t had an increase in call or chat volume from students who were experiencing problems with filing their FAFSAs because of delayed tax returns. The spokesman did not respond to additional questions.\n\nThe IRS also did not respond to The Daily Signal\u2019s request for comment.\n\nMcCarthy told The Daily Signal it\u2019s likely students filing FAFSAs who are delayed in filing their tax returns because of erroneous 1095-A forms are on a case-by-case basis. However, she reassured students their questions can be answered by the institution they would like to attend.\n\n\u201cIf they do have a delay in being able to file their tax returns that\u2019s beyond their control, I would encourage them to get in touch with their financial aid office to find out about if there is any impact,\u201d she said.\n\n>>> IRS Official Warns That \u2018Thousands\u2019 of Obamacare Enrollees Could See Delay in Tax Refunds", "article_metadata": {"description": "Erroneous information given to ACA enrollees could delay refunds for thousands of Americans.
