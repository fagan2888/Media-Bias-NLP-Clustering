DUBLIN--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/rvd8w3/healthcare_cloud) has announced the addition of the "Healthcare Cloud Computing Market by Application (PACS, EMR, CPOE, RCM, Claims Management), Deployment (Private, Public), Service (SaaS, IaaS), Pricing (Pay as you go) & by End-User (Providers, Payers) - Analysis and Global Forecasts to 2020" report to their offering.

Cloud computing helps store, manage, and process data from disparate locations, and delivers hosted services over the internet. In the healthcare industry, cloud computing as a technology is offered in four forms computation, storage, memory, and networking. Cloud computing is increasingly being adopted in the healthcare industry owing to the increasing pressure to curtail healthcare costs while maintaining the quality of care provided to patients.

The global healthcare cloud computing market is segmented on the basis of application, deployment model, service model, pricing model, component, end user, and region. By application, the market is categorized into clinical information systems (CIS) and nonclinical information systems (NCIS). In 2015, CIS is expected to hold the largest share of the market. This segment is expected to grow at the fastest rate during the forecast period (2015 to 2020).

On the basis of deployment model, the healthcare cloud computing market is categorized into public cloud, private cloud, and hybrid cloud. In 2015, the private cloud segment is estimated to account for the largest share of the market.

The market, by service model, is segmented into software-as-a-service (SaaS), platform-as-a-service (PaaS), and information-as-a-service (IaaS). In 2015, the software-as-a-service segment is expected to account for the largest share of the market.

The healthcare cloud computing market, by pricing model, is segmented into pay-as-you-go and spot pricing. In 2015, the pay-as-you-go segment is expected to account for the largest share of the market.

On the basis of component, the market is divided into hardware, software, and services. In 2015, the software segment is estimated to account for the largest share of the market.

On the basis of end user, the healthcare cloud computing market is divided into healthcare providers and healthcare payers. In 2015, the healthcare providers segment is estimated to account for the largest share of the market.

Key factors expected to spur the growth of this market are reforms in various countries benefiting healthcare IT, proliferation of new payment models and the cost-efficiency of cloud technology, and the implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA). Moreover, teleCloud and the formation of accountable care organizations (ACOs) are creating growth opportunities for the market. However, the security of patient data on the cloud is a crucial issue likely to restrain the growth of this market.
