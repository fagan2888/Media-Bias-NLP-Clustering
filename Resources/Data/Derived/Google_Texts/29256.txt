While many in the United States and abroad rejoiced at the Supreme Court’s same-sex marriage ruling on Friday, the Islamic State sadistically “celebrated” in Syria by throwing gay men off of buildings.

In a new video, which has since been removed from YouTube, ISIS sympathizers are seen hurling four gay men off a rooftop while hundreds gathered below to watch the gruesome executions.

ISIS extremists then took to Twitter to share photos from the execution along with the hashtag #LoveWins.
