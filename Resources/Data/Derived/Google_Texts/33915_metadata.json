No Republican president \u2013 and we\u2019re going back to the very first, Abraham Lincoln \u2013 has ever won the White House without winning Ohio.\n\nIn fact, the way the electoral college map skews toward Democratic presidential candidates, most political analysts see the Republican nominee coming up short of the 270 electoral votes needed to win without taking both Ohio and Florida.\n\nBarack Obama won them in his two elections, but he would have been elected president with or without them. George W. Bush, on the other, would have lost in both 2000 and 2004 without winning both Florida and Ohio.\n\nEnter John Kasich.\n\nOhio\u2019s Republican governor has done practically everything a candidate for the Republican presidential nomination can do except formally announce his candidacy and set up a committee with the Federal Elections Commission.\n\nThe ranks of those who believe Kasich will not run are becoming thin indeed.\n\nSo, if Ohio is so all-fired important to the GOP\u2019s chance of winning back the White House (and it is), does that mean Kasich has to be on the GOP ticket, either as the presidential or vice presidential candidate, when the Republicans gather for their nominating convention next July?\n\nWell, maybe so. Or maybe not. But it probably wouldn\u2019t hurt if he were on the ticket \u2013 given that he was re-elected last fall with nearly 64 percent of the vote and has a high approval rating among Buckeye voters.\n\n\u201cMost people, myself included, think that if Kasich were on the ticket, either as president or vice president, it would probably be a fair bet that the Republicans would win Ohio,\u2019\u2019 said John C. Green, director of the University of Akron\u2019s Ray C. Bliss Institute for Applied Politics.\n\nBut, Green, said, \u201cthere are no guarantees. You never know. It couldn\u2019t hurt.\u201d\n\nLarry J. Sabato, director of the University of Virginia\u2019s Center for Politics, and his colleagues, Kyle Kondik and Geoffrey Skelley wrote a detailed piece on the 2016 electoral college map for last week\u2019s edition of Sabato\u2019s Crystal Ball, a closely watched weekly newsletter of national politics.\n\nSabato, Kondik and Skelley made it very clear they think there is no clear path to the White House for the Republicans without winning Ohio and Florida.\n\n\u201cIf a Republican can\u2019t win Ohio, can he win other competitive Midwestern states that are usually more Democrat, such as Pennsylvania or Wisconsin?,\u2019\u2019 They wrote.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s very doubtful as the Keystone and Badger states have been more Democratic than Ohio in every presidential election going back to 1964, when Lyndon Johnson performed slightly better in Ohio than Wisconsin,\u201d they wrote.\n\nPennsylvania, they said, has been more Democratic than Ohio in every election since 1948.\n\nAnd what about Florida?\n\n\u201cSimilarly, if Republicans can\u2019t win Florida, they would likely have to make it up in the Midwest and Pennsylvania,\u2019\u2019 Sabato\u2019s Crystal Ball said.\n\nSo if Florida and Ohio are so important for the Republicans, what about a Florida/Ohio GOP ticket, or an Ohio/Florida ticket? Would that seal the deal for the GOP?\n\nAfter all, there are two well-known Florida Republicans in the mix for the GOP nomination \u2013 former governor Jeb Bush and U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio.\n\n\u201cA Bush/Kasich ticket or a Rubio/Kasich ticket could conceivably be enough to win both states,\u2019\u2019 Green said. \u201cAnd winning Ohio and Florida \u2013 well, that would be a giant step for the Republicans.\u201d\n\nKondik, Skelley, and Sabato seem not to be so sure that Bush or Rubio might give the GOP a home state advantage in Florida, although they point out that the last two presidents did get a boost in their home states \u2013 Illinois and Texas. Both Illinois and Texas were not as competitive as Florida Is likely to be.\n\nSabato\u2019s Crystal Ball said it is worth mentioning that Kasich \u201chas strong approval ratings back home (61 percent, according to Quinnipiac University), although he is a less plausible nominee that Bush, Rubio or (Wisconsin governor) Scott Walker.\u201d\n\nBut, they said, \u201che might have the best case of any of the potential nominees for prompting a ratings change in his home state, though as with the others, we would need strong polling data to back that up.\u201d\n\nKasich is nothing like most of the ever-growing crowd of GOP presidential contenders.\n\nHe\u2019s taken positions that don\u2019t go over well with the party\u2019s conservative wing, which holds enormous influence in some early caucus and primary states like Iowa and South Carolina.\n\nThe Ohio governor favors Common Core education standards, favors Ohio accepting Medicaid dollars from Obamacare, and has wagged his finger and lectured his own party for not doing enough for the poorest among us.\n\nHis philosophy might hinder him in some early primaries and caucuses, Green said, \u201cbut, from a general election standpoint, he looks like a real asset.\u201d\n\nKasich, Green said, \u201chas this unorthodox Republicanism that could appeal to a lot of people. He\u2019s totally un-scripted. If people are looking for an authentic human being, spontaneous and un-scripted, they\u2019d have one in John Kasich.\u201d\n\nKasich has set up a non-profit 527 committee called New Day for America to raise money for his travels around the country, to early primary and caucus states and elsewhere. It could easily be converted into a presidential exploratory committee.\n\nThe question many are asking is simple: Can he win?\n\nNo one has the answer to that.\n\nGreen said Kasich would have \u201ca chance to be competitive early because the field is so large.\u201d\n\nAnd the idea that Kasich might concentrate what money he has on New Hampshire\u2019s first-in-the-nation primary might work well.\n\n\u201cNew Hampshire has a penchant for supporting mavericks,\u2019\u2019 Green said. \u201cBut he would have to do well. And coming in second wouldn\u2019t be that bad.\u201d\n\nBut as the field narrows \u2013 and it will \u2013 Kasich would have a real challenge in raising the kind of money it will take to be competitive in later primaries, Green said.\n\n\u201cHe needs to find some very wealthy person or persons to fund a Super PAC for him,\u2019\u2019 Green said.\n\nGreen said he has no idea when Kasich might formally announce \u2013 assuming he does. But he does not believe it is getting too late.\n\n\u201cI could see him making it official sometime around Labor Day,\u2019\u2019 Green said.\n\nWhen and if Kasich makes it official, one thing will be clear \u2013 his biggest advantage might be that he has the words \u201csecond-term governor of Ohio\u201d on his resume.\n\nBecause, once again, Ohio is at the heart of it all.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Politics", "description": "Can the Republicans win the White House without winning Ohio next year?
