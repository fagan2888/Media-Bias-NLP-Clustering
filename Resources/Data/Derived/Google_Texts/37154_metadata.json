And that, by my estimate, is about four million people. In return, we\u2019ll have a fixed system where over 30 million people will now for the first time be able to access fairly price and guaranteed health insurance\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe currently have a highly discriminatory system where if you\u2019re sick, if you\u2019ve been sick or [if] you\u2019re going to get sick, you cannot get health insurance. The only way to end that discriminatory system is to bring everyone into the system and pay one fair price.\n\nYesterday\u2019s interview transcript between Chuck Todd and the Architect of ObamaCare, Mr. Jonathan Gruber, M.I.T. should be screaming from every newspaper this morning. But there was hardly a blip on the radar screen. Real Clear Politics has the video. Mr. Gruber revealed the singular truth about the real reason our government created and passed ObamaCare \u2014 it was not about an \u201caffordable\u201d new system; it was about a \u201cdiscriminatory\u201d old system, and the government \u201cfix\u201d. Here\u2019s what Gruber described:\n\nThe Affordable Care Act was merely a red herring for what the government really thought about the healthcare system \u2014 that it was discriminatory, and could be used as another vessel for wealth transfer.\n\nThe legislative name for ObamaCare is the Affordable Care Act. This name was chosen precisely to appeal to Americans to consider buying a health insurance plan from a government-run exchange. Who doesn\u2019t like the idea of something that is \u201caffordable\u201d? By using that term, it suggested that the current system of health care was the opposite \u2013\u201dunafforable\u201d.\n\nWhere to start?\n\nThe most glaring and insulting concept in his statement is the idea that someone is a \u201cgenetic winner\u201d and \u201ca lottery winner\u201d that has been \u201cpaying an artificially low price because of this discrimination\u201d.\n\nThe idea of a \u201cgenetic winner\u201d is incredibly chilling. Brave New world-ish even. It completely removes the idea of personal responsibility in the health equation. We are somehow only and entirely healthy or not because of superior genetics, and therefore those who are should be financially punished for it due to a government-imposed standard of \u201cfairness\u201d.\n\nThe next absurity goes hand-in-hand with that \u2014 the idea that people who \u201cwon\u201d the \u201cgenetic lottery\u201d are paying artificially low prices for insurance. By what standard is something \u201cartificially low\u201d (or not)? The government standard! Not the insurance market. The government tells us something is artificially low and therefore needs to be corrected. It is their justification to punish the \u201cwinners\u201d, a form of reparation of to those who the government considers \u201cgenetic lottery losers\u201d. Pay up! It\u2019s not fair you have been paying too low of a price!\n\nGruber also describes in detail how the government has decided the system is discriminatory: \u201cwhere if you\u2019re sick, if you\u2019ve been sick or [if] you\u2019re going to get sick, you cannot get health insurance. At every point in time \u2014 present, past, and future \u2014 the system discriminates. If you might get sick in the future, you cannot have insurance now! Such a statement defies all logic. But it doesn\u2019t matter. The groundwork is laid bare: our health care discriminates.\n\nWhat is the solution? Gruber explains that the only way to level the playing field and be fair is to force the \u201cgenetic winners\u201d to pay their fair share (sound familiar?). And finally, finally, Gruber tells us, \u201cIn return, we\u2019ll have a fixed system where over 30 million people will now for the first time be able to access fairly price and guaranteed health insurance\u201d.\n\nA fixed system now. Because the government decided the system was \u201cbroken\u201d. It was the fault of the genetic lottery winners and the artificially low prices who discriminated against those who did not have insurance.\n\nOf course, there was no distinction of the uninsured between those who could not get insurance or who chose not to have insurance either. The Uninsured were discriminated against. And that needed to be fixed \u2014 by the government. We\u2019re here to help.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act is only about being affordable to some. It is revealed to be another giant wealth transfer. Take the genetic lottery winners, kick them off their freely chosen policies, put them on the more expensive ObamaCare government exchanges, and subsidize those who have been discriminated against to make it fair for all.\n\nFairness is yet again the objective of, and gift from, the government \u2014 no matter the cost to our wallets or our dignity.", "article_metadata": {"rating": "general", "description": "We Finally Have The Real Reason Behind Obamacare: Discrimination and Wealth Transfer, Healthcare, Genetic Winners, Lottery Winners,", "og": {"description": "We Finally Have The Real Reason Behind Obamacare: Discrimination and Wealth Transfer, Healthcare, Genetic Winners, Lottery Winners,", "title": "We Finally Have The Real Reason Behind ObamaCare: Discrimination and Wealth Transfer"}, "robots": "index, follow", "revisit-after": "7 days", "keywords": "We Finally Have The Real Reason Behind Obamacare: Discrimination and Wealth Transfer, Healthcare, Genetic Winners, Lottery Winners,", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc27b\"", "article_summary": "This name was chosen precisely to appeal to Americans to consider buying a health insurance plan from a government-run exchange.\nThat means that the genetic winners, the lottery winners who\u2019ve been paying an artificially low price because of this discrimination now will have to pay more in return.\nThe government tells us something is artificially low and therefore needs to be corrected.\nTake the genetic lottery winners, kick them off their freely chosen policies, put them on the more expensive ObamaCare government exchanges, and subsidize those who have been discriminated against to make it fair for all.\nIt was the fault of the genetic lottery winners and the artificially low prices who discriminated against those who did not have insurance."}
