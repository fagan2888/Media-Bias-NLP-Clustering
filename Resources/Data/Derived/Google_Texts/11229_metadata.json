Patrick Meehan (R-PA), passed 251-173, with ten Democrats voting in favor.\n\nRep. Ed Royce (R-CA), chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, explained why the bill was so necessary, especially in light of Obama's ill-conceived nuclear agreement with Iran:\n\n\u201cThe Iranian regime has actively funded terrorist groups and operations that have resulted in the deaths of hundreds of Americans. While U.S. courts have held Iran liable for these attacks, requiring Iran to compensate American victims, these judgments remain unpaid. \u201cThe Obama Administration didn\u2019t get compensation for the families of those whose lives were taken by Iranian terrorism in negotiations. U.S. officials admitted they didn\u2019t even try. Once sanctions are lifted, Iran will hit a jackpot in the billions. And American victims will still be out in the cold. That\u2019s wrong. This legislation addresses this injustice. There should be no sanctions relief until Iran pays up what it owes the families of these Americans.\u201d\n\nThe National Republican Congressional Committee, meanwhile, had some harsh words for \u2018nay\u2019 votes like Rep. Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ):\n\n\u201cKyrsten Sinema is putting the interests of a state sponsor of terrorism over the very people he was elected to represent and protect,\u201d said NRCC Communications Director Katie Martin. \u201cInstead of taking a stand against Iran and standing up for their innocent victims, Sinema has turned a blind eye to their indiscretions. Arizona families deserve a member they can trust to protect them, and not the terrorists.\u201d\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned the world this week that relieving Iran from sanctions will only help to clear their path to a nuclear bomb. Any effort to slow that process, as H.R. 3457 intends, is a good start.\n\nThis is the latest effort from congressional Republicans to stymie key provisions in Obama\u2019s nuclear agreement with Iran. Additionally, before it secured enough votes, the nuclear deal faced bipartisan rejection. Democratic senators like Chuck Schumer and Bob Menendez, for instance, came out strongly against it. Considering Obama has basically admitted that the deal will finance terror, he cannot be surprised by its number of defectors.\n\nThe president, not usually one to keep both ears open for his critics, is expected to veto the bill.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Good start..05/27/2016 7:46:23AM EST.", "author": "Cortney O'Brien", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Good start.", "title": "House Passes Bill to Make Iran Compensate Terror Attack Victims", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/cortneyobrien/2015/10/03/house-passes-bill-to-make-iran-compensate-terror-attack-victims-n2060336", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2008/38/a94f2023-6ebb-4c2c-a586-28eb8026364e@news.ap.org.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Good start.", "title": "House Passes Bill to Make Iran Compensate Terror Attack Victims", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/cortneyobrien/2015/10/03/house-passes-bill-to-make-iran-compensate-terror-attack-victims-n2060336", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2008/38/a94f2023-6ebb-4c2c-a586-28eb8026364e@news.ap.org.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "House Complicates Iran Deal by Passing Bill to Make Iran Compensate Terror Victims, Cortney O'Brien, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "While U.S. courts have held Iran liable for these attacks, requiring Iran to compensate American victims, these judgments remain unpaid.\n\u201cInstead of taking a stand against Iran and standing up for their innocent victims, Sinema has turned a blind eye to their indiscretions.\n\u201cThe Obama Administration didn\u2019t get compensation for the families of those whose lives were taken by Iranian terrorism in negotiations.\nThe Justice for Victims of Iranian Terrorism Act (H.R.\nConsidering Obama has basically admitted that the deal will finance terror, he cannot be surprised by its number of defectors."}
