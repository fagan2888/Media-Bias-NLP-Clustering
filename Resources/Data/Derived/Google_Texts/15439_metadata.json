This is the first time a majority has held that position since 1993 when Pew started asking the question.\n\nPew Research\u2019s poll showed a broad increase among almost all segments of the population, with the largest increases belonging to women, blacks, and Republicans.\n\nThe NRA used this broad increase of support to their advantage in the 2014 election. The NRA spent more than $28 million in 2014 and was successful in over 90 percent of their races, according to The Washington Times.\n\nOne of those elections was Arizona\u2019s 2nd Congressional where the NRA poured in more than $20,000.\n\nBy focusing on rallying their members, they helped Rep. Martha McSally unseated an anti-gun incumbent by just 161 votes out of nearly 220,000 total votes cast.\n\nThis was an especially important victory as it was the seat held by former Rep. Gabby Giffords (D-Ariz.), who survived an assassination attempt and went on to create a gun control group, Americans for Responsible Solutions.\n\nSince the election last year, they have been working on increasing membership, which hit 5 million for the first time this year.\n\nBy mobilizing gun owners to vote, the NRA was able to make the difference in many close elections, including McSally\u2019s.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s this realization \u2014 gun owners know their rights are under attack \u2014 but there\u2019s a bigger issue out there: that people are feeling suffocated, whether its businesses being stifled from regulation, Obamacare or being told how much soda we can drink. There\u2019s been an overreach into our personal freedom. It\u2019s a serious issue, and people are taking notice,\u201d Chris Cox, the executive director of the NRA Institute for Legislative Action, told The Washington Times.\n\nAlthough the NRA\u2019s budget was significant to many races in 2014, it will be a drop in the bucket to the billions that all the campaigns and political action committees will be spending in 2016.\n\nSo instead of dollars, the group will have to focus on its strength \u2014 mobilization.\n\n\u201c2016 is going to be much different. It\u2019s a national election year; we know it\u2019s going to be challenging and expensive,\u201d Cox said. \u201cWe\u2019re constantly working to improve. We have the best grassroots organization in the country and continue to build it out.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "Chris Cox, executive director of the Institute for Legislative Action, the political and lobbying arm of the National Rifle Association (AP Photo/Mark Humphrey) Looking to build on the gains made in 2014, the National Rifle Association is preparing a massive 2016 voter outreach strategy and it...", "title": "NRA gears up for 2016, plans to focus on voter mobilization - Red...", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://redalertpolitics.com/files/2015/05/ff59fd28-2ada-4ec8-85a6-ae1868c4ab54-620x372-600x360.jpeg", "height": 360}, "url": "http://redalertpolitics.com/2015/05/18/nra-gears-2016-plans-focus-voter-mobilization/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 1285945407, "app_id": 529886110401651}, "msvalidate.01": "0F003B4674EABE0F24651B476B61A43C", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/RedAlertPolitics", "tag": "president", "published_time": "2015-05-18T13:12:35+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-18T13:12:35+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca1f7\"", "article_summary": "According to Pew Research Center, a majority of Americans now support gun ownership over gun control.\nBy mobilizing gun owners to vote, the NRA was able to make the difference in many close elections, including McSally\u2019s.\nThe NRA used this broad increase of support to their advantage in the 2014 election.\nIt\u2019s a serious issue, and people are taking notice,\u201d Chris Cox, the executive director of the NRA Institute for Legislative Action, told The Washington Times.\nThe NRA spent more than $28 million in 2014 and was successful in over 90 percent of their races, according to The Washington Times."}
