Approximately 135,000 \"dual eligible\" patients enrolled in managed long-term care in New York are eligible for the FIDA program in the state.\n\nThe state health department began enrolling \"dual eligibles\" on Jan. 1, starting with people who live in New York City and in Nassau County. But so far, far more people have chosen to opt out than have elected to participate.\n\n\u201cThere are currently 765 individuals who have opted in and 27,932 individuals who have opted out,\u201d a health department spokesperson told Capital in an email. \u201cThis is comparable to what other states participating in the demonstration have experienced. Approximately 70 percent of the eligible population has not made a decision on enrollment yet.\u201d\n\nState health officials said it is too soon to gauge the program's viability.\n\nThough the program is voluntary, the state will begin \"passive enrollment\" of all dual-eligibles in New York City and Nassau County on April 1. It will allow anyone to opt out if they are worried about losing continuity of care with their current physician.\n\nThe second phase of the FIDA enrollment program, for people living in Suffolk and Westchester counties, was to begin April 1, but is being delayed. The health department said late last week that it and the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services \u201care temporarily pausing\u201d the implementation of FIDA in Suffolk and Westchester \u201cdue to network deficiencies.\u201d\n\nThe FIDA program has been controversial among some health care providers and patient advocacy groups who say they\u2019re concerned about patients\u2019 ability to drop out of the program if they are not satisfied and about patients' ability to maintain their regular doctors.\n\n\u201cWe are still in the first phase of the launch of the program. We anticipate that enrollments will increase every month. Call volume suggests that recipients and their caregivers are carefully considering their options,\u201d the state health department said in a statement to Capital. \u201cThe Department is committed to the fully integrated program and will continue to work with all stakeholders to increase enrollment numbers while also focusing on the quality of the patient experience for those already enrolled.\u201d\n\nFor people who are already enrolled, early reports suggest FIDA is working well, allowing doctors to coordinate care in a way they\u2019ve never been able to before, said Krystal Scott, New York state policy director at the Medicare Rights Center.\n\n\u201cPeople who are currently enrolled are, as far as we\u2019ve heard, able to access services, which is great,\u201d Scott said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/albany/2015/03/8563390/slow-start-ambitious-state-medicaid-initiative", "image": "http://www.capitalnewyork.com/sites/default/files/a%20-%20medicaid_0.png", "type": "article", "title": "Slow start for ambitious state Medicaid initiative"}, "robots": "all", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "Just a few hundred participate in reform program"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfbd8\"", "article_summary": "Call volume suggests that recipients and their caregivers are carefully considering their options,\u201d the state health department said in a statement to Capital.\nThe state health department began enrolling \"dual eligibles\" on Jan. 1, starting with people who live in New York City and in Nassau County.\nApproximately 135,000 \"dual eligible\" patients enrolled in managed long-term care in New York are eligible for the FIDA program in the state.\n\u201cThere are currently 765 individuals who have opted in and 27,932 individuals who have opted out,\u201d a health department spokesperson told Capital in an email.\nApproximately 700,000 dual eligibles in New York State account for roughly 37 percent of Medicare spending and 45 percent of Medicaid spending, or about $36 billion a year, according to a 2012 report by the United Hospital Fund\u2019s Medicaid Institute."}
