It doesn\u2019t\u2019 matter how.\u201d\n\nHis fastest lap was 2 minutes, 2.135 seconds and stunned the Ducati garage. Ducati rider Andrea Dovizioso appeared to be cruising to the pole when Marquez was trotting through pit lane on foot.\n\nMarquez dropped to seventh before he got back on the track and ripped through each sector, picking up time with each split to earn his 23rd career pole position.\n\nTwo hours later, Marquez said he still didn\u2019t know if the warning light was an engine or gearbox problem. He stopped the bike to preserve the engine because MotoGP allows teams to use only five in a season.\n\nBut even then, he still had to run stiff-legged and stiff-armed in his protective riding gear.\n\n\u201cThe last lap was pushing 100 percent,\u201d he said. \u201cI nearly crashed.\u201d\n\nMarquez was lucky to be so close to his garage when the problem happened. Had he been at the far turn, it would have been about a two-mile run and too far to even bother.\n\nMovistar Yamaha\u2019s Jorge Lorenzo and Valentino Rossi will start third and fourth Sunday. Rossi won the season opener in Qatar.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sprint on foot lands Marquez on pole yet again in Austin GP", "title": "Sprint on foot lands Marquez on pole yet again in Austin GP", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Sprint on foot lands Marquez on pole yet again in Austin GP", "title": "Sprint on foot lands Marquez on pole yet again in Austin GP", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/04/11/sprint_on_foot_lands_marquez_on_pole_yet_again_in_austin_gp/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/austin-gp-motorcycle-racing.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Sprint on foot lands Marquez on pole yet again in Austin GP", "title": "Sprint on foot lands Marquez on pole yet again in Austin GP", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/austin-gp-motorcycle-racing.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Jim Vertuno", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd27d3\"", "article_summary": "Ducati rider Andrea Dovizioso appeared to be cruising to the pole when Marquez was trotting through pit lane on foot.\nTopics: From the Wires, Entertainment News, NewsAUSTIN, Texas (AP) \u2014 Not even a stopped bike and a \u201csprint\u201d on foot could keep Marc Marquez off the pole at the MotoGP Grand Prix of the Americas.\nTwo hours later, Marquez said he still didn\u2019t know if the warning light was an engine or gearbox problem.\nWith barely three minutes left in qualifying Saturday, Marquez had to ditch his Repsol Honda shortly after leaving his garage when a warning light flashed.\nHe stopped the bike to preserve the engine because MotoGP allows teams to use only five in a season."}
