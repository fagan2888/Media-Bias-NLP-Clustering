He imagines other people must think the worst.\n\n\u201c\u2018You must have molested him, you must have beaten him with a hammer when no one was looking,'\u201d he said. \u201cWe were just normal parents. We thought we were doing everything right. Since my kids could talk, we talked about drugs, smoking, premarital sex. The only subject I didn\u2019t harp on with the kids was suicide. If I covered the basics, that would take care of itself.\u201d\n\nBruce wishes he could stop the next kid.\n\nMaine is trying.\n\nThousands of teachers, bus drivers and school lunch workers will be trained over the next three years to spot the warning signs of suicide \u2014 not to solve problems themselves so much as to whisk a troubled student to someone who can \u2014 all the result of a new state law.\n\nMaine is one of 11 states in the country to adopt some form of mandatory training for school employees.\n\nIt\u2019s also one of six states with a new federal suicide prevention grant, $1.2 million to spend on outreach and suicide screening through school-based health centers starting this spring.\n\nLast year, at least 15 teenagers committed suicide in Maine; the Medical Examiner\u2019s Office is still working on the official tally. If that number holds, it would be about twice the number who took their own lives in 2012.\n\nGrace Eaton lost her son Glen Gilchrist 16 years ago. She pushed for the new Maine mandatory training law, rallying legislators and other parents. She\u2019s now the school counselor at Livermore Elementary School. A year after Glen\u2019s death, she took the training to become a \u201cgatekeeper,\u201d someone trained to spot the warning signs.\n\nThe signs were there \u2014 a busy senior at Mt. Blue High School, Glen was a standout athlete but hard on himself \u2014 and Eaton had asked once, point blank, would he ever commit suicide?\n\nHe\u2019d told her of course not.\n\n\u201cIf one teacher sees signs and helps that student, isn\u2019t it worth it?\u201d Eaton said. \u201cIf I could go back 16 years myself, of course I would do things differently, the things I know today. I didn\u2019t get that chance.\u201d\n\nTo read the full story, go to http://www.sunjournal.com/news/lewiston-auburn/0001/11/30/maine-schools-suicide-watch-training-all-personnel-begins-suicide-rate-rises-among-teens/1496192#.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\u201cBruce\u201d knew his teenage son was stressed, overscheduled with sports, extracurriculars and a girlfriend, busy sometimes five nights a week.
