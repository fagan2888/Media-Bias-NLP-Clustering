The 50 x 20-foot opening in the Earth\u2019s surface said that the story was just a \u201ctypical\u201d cover to mislead media.\n\n\u201cI came here to do two things, and that\u2019s look pretty in front the cameras, and call attention to an arbitrary sales tax that punishes tanning bed users and businesses,\u201d Cowher said. \u201cThe media covered Occupy Wall Street like the great moral crusade of our time, but Occupy Tanning Salon is just this story of, \u2018Oh, look at this jagoff eating cars and causing problems.\u2019 Really? That\u2019s my legacy? Gitdahellaht.\u201d\n\nCowher swallowed a 2002 Saturn after arriving, which one local likened to \u201cshowing up at a Super Bowl party and eating the grill before even saying \u2018Hi.\u2019 \u201d Cowher just called it an \u201caccident.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought it might have been a Primanti\u2019s. Fact of the matter is I can\u2019t see anything down here.\u201d\n\nLocal reports indicated that the driver of the Saturn was unhurt after escaping through the passenger\u2019s side window. The vehicle was lifted out Tuesday night.\n\nThe target of Cowher\u2019s ire is a 10-percent sales tax on tanning salon goers, which is supposed to be collected by businesses and remitted to the federal government. The IRS ruled in 2013 that the tax applied only to \u201ctaxable indoor tanning services,\u201d and that \u201cqualified physical fitness facilities\u201d offering tanning services at no additional cost are exempt.\n\nThe tax, which took effect soon after Obamacare was signed into law, generated a fuss alongside dozens of other Obamacare provisions for which the IRS is responsible. But it largely has been a novelty \u2014 a pop-culture punchline that invokes Snooki and generates far less revenue than the government predicted. The possibilities for that vary: a lack of compliance, businesses shuttering, and poor forecasts, POLITICO noted this year.\n\nPerhaps a fourth is on its way: deterrence via sinkhole.\n\n\u201cNah, I\u2019m not here to be an obstacle, I\u2019m just here to raise awareness. Hashtag that,\u201d Cowher said. \u201c#RepealTheTanningTax, #Sinkhole, #StandWithCowher. That\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about. I\u2019m not leaving here until I\u2019m trending in Pittsburgh.\u201d\n\nAs of press time, the Obama administration had already granted a modest amount of unused stimulus funds to satisfy Cowher\u2019s hunger with gravel.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "A sinkhole outside a Pittsburgh-area tanning salon has opened up to Red Alert Politics in an exclusive interview, saying its reason for coming into being was \"an act of protest\" that had been \"bubbling up\" since the implementation of a punitive Obamacare tax in 2010.", "title": "Sinkhole opens up outside tanning salon to protest Obamacare tax -...", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://redalertpolitics.com/files/2014/08/Sinkhole-Swallows-Car_Deat-600x400.jpg", "height": 400}, "url": "http://redalertpolitics.com/2014/08/13/sinkhole-opens-outside-tanning-salon-protest-obamacare-tax/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 1285945407, "app_id": 529886110401651}, "msvalidate.01": "0F003B4674EABE0F24651B476B61A43C", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/RedAlertPolitics", "tag": "satire", "published_time": "2014-08-13T14:31:31+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-13T14:37:34+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "The IRS ruled in 2013 that the tax applied only to \u201ctaxable indoor tanning services,\u201d and that \u201cqualified physical fitness facilities\u201d offering tanning services at no additional cost are exempt.\nA sinkhole outside a Pittsburgh-area tanning salon has opened up to Red Alert Politics in an exclusive interview, saying its reason for coming into being was \u201can act of protest\u201d that had been \u201cbubbling up\u201d since the implementation of a punitive Obamacare tax in 2010.\nThe target of Cowher\u2019s ire is a 10-percent sales tax on tanning salon goers, which is supposed to be collected by businesses and remitted to the federal government.\n\u201cThe media covered Occupy Wall Street like the great moral crusade of our time, but Occupy Tanning Salon is just this story of, \u2018Oh, look at this jagoff eating cars and causing problems.\u2019 Really?\n\u201cI came here to do two things, and that\u2019s look pretty in front the cameras, and call attention to an arbitrary sales tax that punishes tanning bed users and businesses,\u201d Cowher said."}
