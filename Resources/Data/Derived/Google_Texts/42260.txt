Back in January, we brought you the story of Fumio Demura, the martial arts expert whose credits include working as Mr. Miyagi's stunt double in The Karate Kid franchise, Mortal Combat, Rising Sun, and The Island of Dr. Moreau.

Demura’s dojo faces closure as the City of Santa Ana plans to acquire his property as well as eight other small businesses as part of the Bristol Street Widening Project. The project has been around since the early 90's, but is only now reaching the phase that threatens these businesses.

After the story aired, the Institute for Justice contacted the Bristol Street Business Coalition to help fight against Santa Ana’s eminent domain abuse and save Demura’s business.
