Daily Mail columnist Piers Morgan is taking his gun control stance to whole new level after launching an attack against President Obama for pointing his finger like a gun in a new Buzzfeed video to promote Obamacare.

“President Obama pretends to fire a gun to promote health care. Is it just me that finds this appalling?” the former CNN host, who now resides in London, tweeted Friday to his nearly 4.4 million followers.

“100,000+ people a year hit by gunfire in America — and President Obama thinks it’s ‘cool’ to promote healthcare by pretending to fire a gun,” he added, receiving 86 retweets. “Maybe I’d laugh more at Obama’s gun pose if he’d kept a single one of his promises to Newtown families re guns.”

One Twitter user suggested that Mr. Morgan’s gun control efforts failed in the U.S. “Do you expect gun culture will change overnight?” he asked.

“No, but I will keep trying,” Mr. Morgan declared.

“The man who killed the 3 Muslim students had 12 guns in his home incl 4 handguns, 2 shotguns & 6 rifles. It was his ‘right,’” Mr. Morgan scoffed.

In another tweet on Sunday, the British columnist memorialized Michele Ferrero, the owner of chocolate maker Ferrero SpA.

“His beloved Kinder eggs, unlike guns, are banned in U.S. for being hazardous to kids’ health,” he said.
