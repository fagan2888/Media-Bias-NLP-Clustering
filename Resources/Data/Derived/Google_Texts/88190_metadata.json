Salaries of employees who were not part of Clinton\u2019s office for a full fiscal year were not included. Because the Senate fiscal year extends from Oct. 1 to Sept. 30, Clinton\u2019s first year in the Senate, which began on Jan. 3, 2001, was also not included in the analysis.\n\nIronically, Clinton herself has been a big supporter of the equal pay movement, a position that will undoubtedly be undermined upon the discovery of the pay gap in her own Senate office.\n\n20 years ago, women made 72 cents on the dollar to men. Today it's still just 77 cents.
