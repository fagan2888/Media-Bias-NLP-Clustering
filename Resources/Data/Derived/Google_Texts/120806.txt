Have you ever thought of trauma as anything other than the most horrific act? Before learning about Trauma Informed Care, I wouldn’t have believed that over 70% of society has experienced some form of trauma in their lives; and most likely as a child.

Trauma includes a wide range of occurrences such as:

• all types of abuse,

• physical and sexual assault and bullying,

• fighting or living with war and terrorism,

• surviving a natural disaster or accident,

• surviving the death of a loved one,

• surviving a life altering experience such as a recession, divorce or job loss

Let’s explore the trauma and the changing family structure just for a millisecond. Today 41.5% of all babies from all races combined are born to single mothers. And for those married couples having children, Jennifer Baker of the Forest Institute of Professional Psychology in Springfield, Missouri reports that the divorce rate in America for first marriages is 50%, the divorce rate for second marriages is 67% and for third marriages is 74%.

Children living with a single parent or a parent living with an unmarried partner are most at risk for child abuse, which is over eight times the rate of children living with married biological parents. What might happen when a child experiencing trauma doesn’t get the help he or she needs? Take a look: (Child Abuse & Criminal Behavior (www.childhelp.org/pages/statistics/).

• 14% of all men in prison in the USA were abused as children.

• 36% of all women in prison were abused as children.

• Children who experience child abuse & neglect are 59% more likely to be arrested as a juvenile,

• 28% more likely to be arrested as an adult, and 30% more likely to commit violent crime.

According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office on Women’s Health, 85% – 95% of women in the public mental health system report a history of trauma, with the abuse most commonly having occurred in childhood. So, the Centers for Disease Control, along with Kaiser Permanente commissioned one of the largest investigations ever conducted to assess associations between childhood traumas and later-life health and wellbeing. Almost two-thirds of the study participants reported at least one adverse childhood experience of physical or sexual abuse, neglect, or family dysfunction, and more than twenty percent reported three or more such experiences.

The National Council (www.thenationalcouncil.org) says that trauma occurs when a person is overwhelmed by events or circumstances and responds with intense fear, horror, and helplessness. Extreme stress overwhelms the person’s capacity to cope. An individual’s experience of trauma impacts every area of human functioning — physical, mental, behavioral, social, spiritual. There is a direct correlation between trauma and physical health conditions such as diabetes, COPD, heart disease, cancer, and high blood pressure.

Since Kentucky ranks #44 out of 50 in overall health according to the 2012 America’s Health ranking, I’d say it’s time to take a look at how past trauma is affecting our citizens mental AND physical health, not the least of which is the economic impact of trauma on our community. The ACE Study revealed that the economic costs of untreated trauma-related alcohol and drug abuse alone were estimated at $161 billion in 2000. The human costs are incalculable.

Trauma is widespread but healing is possible which is why trauma informed care matters.

According to SAMHSA’s National Center for Trauma-Informed Care, when an organization works to become trauma informed, every part of the organization is assessed and potentially adapted to include a basic understanding of how trauma affects a person’s life. Through understanding trauma and its impact, trauma informed organizations strive to be supportive and avoid re-traumatization. Trauma informed organizations ask the question “what has happened to you?” instead of “what’s wrong with you?” Providers in trauma informed organizations not only guide and support people, but they also engage in self-care practices to help manage the effects of chronic exposure to others trauma and their own past trauma, if they have one.

A national movement has emerged supporting trauma informed care. People who suffer because of trauma receive services from a wide array of community providers – emergency services, law enforcement and courts, social services, housing and shelters, mental health care and substance abuse treatment, and primary healthcare. Any of these organizations can move towards becoming trauma informed and when they do, the people receiving their services are better satisfied, more engaged and experience more successful outcomes.

Want to know if you or someone you care about is receiving trauma informed care? Ask these questions about the organization providing services:

• Have you been asked if you’ve experienced some kind of trauma and encouraged to discuss how this has affected your life?

• Do you know if evidence based treatments are available or being used to assist you?

• Do the providers help you to feel empowered that you can heal from the trauma you’ve experienced?

• Do you feel safe and free from re-traumatization when receiving care?

Seven Counties is one of the first organizations in Kentucky to embrace Trauma Informed Care. I’m impressed by the compassion of care not only for the people we serve but for the employees that deliver the care. I’ll be participating in agency wide Trauma Informed Care training to learn how to adopt better options of care not only for my team but for my family and friends.
