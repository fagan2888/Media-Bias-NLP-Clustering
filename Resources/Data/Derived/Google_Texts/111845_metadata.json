Pictured are (L-R) Ava Shaw(4) and Matilda Lamaro(3) at Kidz on Regent Child Care Centre in Regents Park.\n\nPARENTS who refuse to vaccinate their children must be stripped of childcare payments unless their care is quarantined to the family home.\n\nThe Productivity Commission\u2019s report into childcare has adopted a tough line on vaccination on the basis that all \u00adparents must play a collective role in protecting children from preventable diseases.\n\nMirroring The Sunday Telegraph\u2019s successful No Jab, No Play campaign that has forced all governments to act, the report warns access to childcare rebates \u201cmust be conditional on the child being fully immunised, \u00adunless care \u00adoccurs in the child\u2019s home\u201d.\n\nThe message is stronger than current arrangements that offer a range of exemptions for vaccine refusers who argue they are conscientious objectors.\n\nIn NSW, childcare centres can ban children who are not vaccinated and other states are considering similar reforms. Parents are required to vaccinate children as a condition of the childcare benefit but can seek \u00adexemptions as conscientious objectors or \u201cvaccine refusers\u201d if a GP signs a form to show the parents are aware of the risks.\n\nSocial Services Minister Scott Morrison said he was happy to consider any calls to toughen current protections.\n\n\u201cThe commission makes some very important suggestions in this area. I am open to everything in the report. I am not ruling anything in or out\u201d\n\n\u201cThe commission makes some very important suggestions in this area. I am open to everything in the report. I am not ruling anything in or out,\u201d Mr Morrison said. \u201cThere have been positive outcomes from those types of linkages. There\u2019s nothing to suggest that what has been done in the past wouldn\u2019t be continued.\u201d\n\nLabor leader Bill Shorten went further, backing the commission\u2019s call for action as a commonsense measure.\n\n\u201cKids deserve to grow up safe and healthy. I\u2019m not comfortable with the idea of subsidising people who put kids\u2019 health at risk,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cChildcare support should go to people who are doing the right thing by their child and the children they play with. Families who do the right thing by immunising their child shouldn\u2019t have to worry about whether their child is going to pick up a preventable illness at their childcare centre.\n\n\u201cThis shouldn\u2019t be a political issue, it\u2019s common sense.\u201d\n\nMr Morrison has called for a bipartisan approach on childcare, encouraging Labor to sit down with the government to reach agreement in the Senate and help Australian families with rising care costs.\n\nMr Shorten said the four conditions that would guide Labor on childcare were improving affordability, accessibility, quality and participation.\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s a good idea we\u2019ll sign up to it, but we\u2019ll fight any unfair cuts to childcare support,\u2019\u2019 Mr Shorten said.\n\n\u201cThe Liberals have made plenty of mistakes when it comes to childcare, but if they are finally serious about doing something positive on this, then we\u2019re prepared to work with them. The first thing that Tony Abbott can do is reverse his \u00adbillion-dollar cut to childcare in the last Budget and the $6000 families around Australia were slugged \u2014 that\u2019s the equivalent of three months\u2019 worth of childcare.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"MobileOptimized": 320, "description": "PARENTS who refuse to vaccinate their children must be stripped of childcare payments unless their care is quarantined to the family home.", "generator": "tcog", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/vaccinate-your-children-or-forget-government-rebate-for-daycare/news-story/f632383347b531efa8012a6adbb55bc8", "image": "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/c656edf334e65651ca8a3509ec0de87b", "type": "article", "description": "PARENTS who refuse to vaccinate their children must be stripped of childcare payments unless their care is quarantined to the family home.", "title": "Vaccinate or forget daycare rebate"}, "twitter": {"site": "@dailytelegraph", "image": "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/c656edf334e65651ca8a3509ec0de87b", "description": "PARENTS who refuse to vaccinate their children must be stripped of childcare payments unless their care is quarantined to the family home.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Vaccinate or forget daycare rebate"}, "robots": "noarchive", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "vr": {"canonical": "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/link/f632383347b531efa8012a6adbb55bc8?domain=dailytelegraph.com.au"}, "articleid": "f632383347b531efa8012a6adbb55bc8", "keywords": "vaccine refusers, right thing, conscientious objectors, childcare support, childcare rebates, childcare payments, preventable diseases, Labor leader, family home, tough line, childcare centres, commonsense measure, preventable illness, political issue, billion-dollar cut, bipartisan approach, unfair cuts, rising care costs, childcare benefit, Australian families, positive outcomes, rising costs, Queensland, Australia, Federal Government, Social Services, Tony Abbott, Lawrence Springborg, Jo-Ann Miller, Scott Morrison, Bill Shorten, Sarah Vogler, Cameron Dick", "article": {"published_time": "2015-02-21T13:00:00.000Z", "modified_time": "2015-02-21T10:18:29.000Z"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "Pictured are (L-R) Ava Shaw(4) and Matilda Lamaro(3) at Kidz on Regent Child Care Centre in Regents Park.\nPARENTS who refuse to vaccinate their children must be stripped of childcare payments unless their care is quarantined to the family home.\n\u201cChildcare support should go to people who are doing the right thing by their child and the children they play with.\nIn NSW, childcare centres can ban children who are not vaccinated and other states are considering similar reforms.\nThe Productivity Commission\u2019s report into childcare has adopted a tough line on vaccination on the basis that all \u00adparents must play a collective role in protecting children from preventable diseases."}
