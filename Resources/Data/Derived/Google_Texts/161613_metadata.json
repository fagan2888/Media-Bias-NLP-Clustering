Here\u2019s something you rarely hear me say about Obama: He\u2019s totally right. I\u2019ve made this same point more than once myself. One of the defenses used most often by fans of O\u2019s executive amnesty is that it\u2019s not much of an affront to separation of powers because it\u2019s temporary. Sure, he\u2019s seizing lawmaking power from the branch that\u2019s constitutionally empowered to wield it, but it\u2019ll last only as long as his presidency does. His successor can cancel it with one line scribbled on a piece of paper. Back in reality, it won\u2019t work that way. The deep insight of Obama\u2019s power grab, what makes it sinisterly brilliant, is that it recognizes how reluctant Americans are to abandon the policy status quo, even if that status quo is brand new and imposed through dubious means. ObamaCare is a quintessential example: Despite the law\u2019s abiding unpopularity, even states that went for Romney in 2012 are more inclined to keep it and give it a shot now than to repeal it. When you combine that tendency towards inertia with the momentous fact that Latinos are becoming a bigger part of the national electorate, the next president is guaranteed to think twice about pulling the plug on executive amnesty \u2014 even if he\u2019s a Republican. Quote:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s true a future administration might try to reverse some of our policies. But I\u2019ll be honest with you \u2014 the American people basically have a good heart and want to treat people fairly and every survey shows that if, in fact, somebody has come out and subjected themselves to a background check, registered, paid their taxes, the American people support allowing them to stay. So any future administration that tried to punish people for doing the right thing, I think, would not have the support of the American people,\u201d Mr. Obama told a supportive crowd at a town hall meeting in Nashville. \u201cIt\u2019s true, theoretically, a future administration could do something that I think would be very damaging. It\u2019s not likely, politically, that they reverse everything we\u2019ve done.\u201d\n\nPrecisely. A newly elected Republican president would need to do something about O\u2019s order to placate the conservatives who voted for him, but revision is much more likely than rescission. One obvious reason why:\n\nLatinos like it a lot. Whites do not, a fact that will give even a Democratic successor pause in keeping O\u2019s order as is, but there are arguments that can and will be made to soften some of the white opposition, especially as the heat surrounding the issue right now cools over time. In fact, the White House is already making them. Here\u2019s another taunt to amnesty opponents from one of O\u2019s immigration apparatchiks:\n\nThe man who will oversee President Obama\u2019s new temporary amnesty said Tuesday that part of the reason for the program was to get the illegal immigrants working on the books, making it economically impossible for them ever to be deported by a future president\u2026 \u201cIf this program does what we want it to do, you will now have literally millions of people who will be working on the books, paying taxes, being productive. You cannot so easily by fiat now remove those people from the economy,\u201d said Mr. Rodriguez, who took over as agency director earlier this year.\n\nThe economy is perennially the most important issue to voters. Convince people who mildly oppose Obama\u2019s executive order that they\u2019re risking another recession if the order is rescinded and millions of amnestized workers become illegal laborers again and what happens to their opposition then? Remember, Democrats don\u2019t need to persuade a majority of whites or a majority of the total electorate that O\u2019s order is a good thing which they should support. All they need to do is persuade them that there are enough pros to neutralize the cons and therefore they shouldn\u2019t have a strong opinion about this when they go to vote. Meanwhile, in theory, Latinos will remain grateful to Obama and the Dems for their work on it and will reward them for it. That\u2019s how executive amnesty is supposed to work. And if it does, a Republican successor will be boxed in politically.\n\nYour one consolation is that inertia in public opinion over policy changes can work for the GOP too. If President Cruz decides to use O\u2019s precedent to issue an executive order summarily lowering income tax rates by 10 percent, a measure sure to be popular with everyone except the left, good luck getting his Democratic successor to pull the plug on that by rescinding the order entirely.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Yep.", "title": "Obama taunts GOP: The next president won\u2019t reverse my executive amnesty", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2014/12/10/obama-taunts-gop-the-next-president-wont-reverse-my-executive-amnesty/", "image": {"width": 475, "identifier": "http://media.hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/gal.jpg", "height": 264}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@allahpundit"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-10T16:31:14+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-10T18:36:24+00:00"}, "keywords": "amnesty, deportation, executive, immigration, nashville, Obama, President, reverse,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "article_summary": "One of the defenses used most often by fans of O\u2019s executive amnesty is that it\u2019s not much of an affront to separation of powers because it\u2019s temporary.\nThat\u2019s how executive amnesty is supposed to work.\nObama taunts GOP: The next president won\u2019t reverse my executive amnestyposted at 11:31 am on December 10, 2014 by AllahpunditSkip to 1:25 of the clip for the key bit.\nRemember, Democrats don\u2019t need to persuade a majority of whites or a majority of the total electorate that O\u2019s order is a good thing which they should support.\nConvince people who mildly oppose Obama\u2019s executive order that they\u2019re risking another recession if the order is rescinded and millions of amnestized workers become illegal laborers again and what happens to their opposition then?"}
