As RevCycleIntelligence.com reported, an innovative discipline level within the healthcare supply chain realm is emerging as healthcare costs increase.\n\nSteve Kiewiet, Vice President of Supply Chain Operations at BJC HealthCare, spoke with RevCycleIntelligence.com to provide an expert overview of the current state of healthcare supply chain and its greater implications on revenue cycle. BJC Healthcare is 2015\u2019s winner of the national healthcare provider Supply Chainnovator award by Gartner, Inc, for End-to-End Supply Chain Visibility (E2ESCV).\n\nKiewiet says the healthcare supply chain industry is currently not at the same level as many other industries in terms of efficiency, collaboration, transparency, and connections. \u201cWe have a lot of ground to cover to make the changes necessary to live in the new healthcare economy growing out of healthcare reform and the Affordable Care Act,\u201d says Kiewiet.\n\nTo help cover more ground, Kiewiet says the healthcare supply chain must focus on end-to-end visibility. Supply manufacturers are disciplined in their supply chain efficiency as raw materials progress towards finished goods. However, once a finished good is produced, \u201cfrom that point up until it\u2019s used for a patient, we haven\u2019t focused on efficient tracking like we need to,\u201d he explains.\n\n\u201cDue to vertical internal structures, supplies and supply data historically have been siloed and firewalled so that information important for efficient business operations is fragmented. We end up spending billions of dollars of inventory within these various silos because we live in a world where you can never run out of anything ever, in the interest of what is best for the patient,\u201d says Kiewiet.\n\nInformation about inventory usage used to be generally unknown, which proved especially problematic, he says. Strategies are now in place to better identify what will be used, when, how, where, and by whom, says Kiewiet.\n\n\u201cWe found a couple of innovative supplier partners who said, \u2018Let\u2019s break those firewalls and let\u2019s do something different.\u2019 What does \u2018different\u2019 look like, and what would the value of that be? What value can we drive regardless of an ownership model in starting to have true visibility on that supply chain?\u201d he asks.\n\nRadio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology, says Kiewiet, provides a valuable solution. As HealthITSecurity.com reported, such encrypted information within a mere tag can prove valuable for tracking purposes.\n\nKiewiet says streamlined data-sharing allows for reduced process variation along the healthcare supply chain. \u201cWhen we have visibility of product from finished goods to the use on the patient and we actually capture demand and consumption versus capturing purchasing activity, we capture consumption activity,\u201d maintains Kiewiet. \u201cWe significantly reduce waste and variation in the supply chain. Inventory levels come down for everybody. Product expiration can be virtually eliminated,\u201d he says.\n\nProducts that are at risk of expiration or obsolescence cost money. With increased visibility and collaboration along the healthcare supply chain, products are more likely to be consumed before their shelf life ends, he says, which saves money.\n\nKiewiet\u2019s work began with stents within cardiac cath labs and GI endoscopy labs. Areas of anticipated tangible growth include procedural areas, interventional radiology, operating rooms and implants, he adds.\n\nThe link between healthcare supply chain and revenue cycle is crystal clear, says Kiewiet. Whatever is documented into a procedure must be billed for accordingly, he says. \u201cWe are now developing revenue cycle and clinical data systems along with our inventory system,\u201d he explains. \u201cBecause everything is tagged and everything is visible in our inventory system, we know when a product comes out of storage and goes into a procedure room and is then scanned or documented into a procedure as part of electronic medical records,\u201d he adds.\n\nBilling records and bills must correspond neatly with everything done in a procedure before payment tracking ensues, says Kiewiet. Merging together inventory records, clinical documentation records, and charging records is a top priority, he says. The availability of such information in real time is essential to tracking excess products that later fall off the clinical documentation radar, states Kiewiet. If a product, for instance, is opened and then thrown away or simply was not used, such information should be documented and linked to the inventory record.\n\n\u201cWe can provide real time consumption and inventory record data after a case closes. We can provide a report to the managers of those units that says, 'Ten things came out of inventory and went into that room for this procedure. These things were documented and used. One was opened and thrown away. One wasn\u2019t documented anywhere, and it\u2019s not back in storage. Where is it?'\u201d\n\nAlthough preliminary industry-wide averages exist, acquiring accurate baseline data regarding such numbers is rare, says Kiewiet. Most systems fail to track several billions in healthcare dollars \u2013 about 5 percent \u2013 of expiration or waste because the healthcare industry is not yet able to mimic the fast-paced supply chain models of, say, its consumer goods neighbor, Kiewiet maintains. \u201cWe document a piece of it when we do a physical inventory here and there, but it\u2019s not something we\u2019ve measured. It\u2019s not a discipline that\u2019s been built into the healthcare world yet,\u201d he says.\n\nThe development of robust supply chain teams is key to driving change into the healthcare economy, says Kiewiet. Still, RFID adaption rates and associated requirements are lagging behind technological capabilities.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the ability to do barcode reading in general, the bigger issue to highlight around technology and supply chain in healthcare is data standards,\u201d Kiewiet states. \u201cEven in the stent space, if I go pull a stent off my shelf, (regardless of the manufacturer), that package will have anything from 2-7 barcodes on it. They all have different standards and all have different data tied to the barcode. Which one do I read?\u201d he asks.\n\nThe implementation of standards for data, RFID, barcodes, and product naming would help a lot, he maintains. \u201cTechnology has to be very versatile and very robust to be able to compensate for the lack of data standards,\u201d he explains.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t underestimate how much money we may be losing that we\u2019re not even aware of because we haven\u2019t taken complete control of our supply chain. It\u2019s not just about negotiating a better unit cost. It\u2019s much bigger than that. It\u2019s around aligning our entire supply chain industry from manufacturing to patient use in removing variation and waste. Until we do that together, we\u2019ll fight forever over the pennies in the pricing fight that goes on,\u201d Kiewiet advises.\n\n\u201cWe could remove enough waste from the supply chain that the device manufacturers can achieve strong financial performance and deliver value for their shareholders. The hospitals can do what they need to do and maintain their operating margins and take care of patients and make people better,\u201d explains Kiewiet. \u201cThere is value enough in taking control of the supply chain excess of our industry to fix it. Even with a heavy investment of technology into this, everybody would still come out well ahead.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "An innovative discipline level within the healthcare supply chain realm is emerging as healthcare costs increase.
