It is also the first championship an Edmond teenager has ever qualified for, but then tragedy struck.\n\nAllen Copeland's horse died just before this weekend's big competition. Copeland only has two days to learn his routine on a new horse named Bonita.\n\n\u201cI'm not sure, I've only ridden her one time so I don't know what to expect,\u201d said Copeland.\n\nCopeland rode his former horse, \"Lil Jerry Longlegs\", for two years and they recently qualified for the Futurity. But Lil Jerry died suddenly from colic.\n\n\u201cHe died in the trailer, actually on the way to the hospital,\u201d said trainer Jody Brainard.\n\nIt was a difficult loss, especially for a 14-year-old boy.\n\n\u201cIt was devastating. When I heard the news I was shocked,\u201d said Copeland.\n\nThrough a gracious gesture, a fellow reiner let Copeland use her horse, Bonita, and now Copeland is trying to get used to her.\n\nLil Jerry had a long stride; Bonita's is short and quick. Jerry was lovable, Bonita wants to work and be left alone.\n\n\u201cTiming is something we will not have in a few rides, it's like dancing,\u201d said Brainard. \u201cThe longer you dance with someone the better you are, but he can overcome it,\u201d he added.\n\nCopeland will be competing against the whole United States, Canada, Mexico and foreign countries. He said he will focus on winning, just like he did with Jerry.\n\n\u201cWhen you lose something, you got to keep moving, you can't let it stop you for good and that's what I feel like I'm doing, moving forward every day,\u201d Copeland told News 9.\n\nCopeland competes on Saturday.\n\nThe \"Futurity\" features 1,100 horses and competitors from eight countries. They are competing for nearly $2 million in cash and prizes.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "The Super Bowl of horse reining competitions is in Oklahoma City this weekend and millions of dollars are at stake.", "author": "Lacie Lowry", "og": {"url": "http://www.news9.com/story/30663867/edmond-teen-overcomes-heartbreak-to-compete-in-reining-championship", "image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/9386257_G.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The Super Bowl of horse reining competitions is in Oklahoma City this weekend and millions of dollars are at stake.", "title": "Edmond Teen Overcomes Heartbreak To Compete In Reining Championship"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/9386257_G.jpg", "description": "The Super Bowl of horse reining competitions is in Oklahoma City this weekend and millions of dollars are at stake.", "card": "summary", "title": "Edmond Teen Overcomes Heartbreak To Compete In Reining Championship"}, "wnreadableurl": "edmond-teen-overcomes-heartbreak-to-compete-in-reining-championship", "ROBOTS": "index,follow,noarchive", "owner": "KWTV", "fb": {"app_id": 538140636230283}, "date": "2015/12/03", "KEYWORDS": "Competition, horse, reining, National Reining Horse Association Futurity, Edmond, Copeland, okc, news 9, kwtv", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS16", "verify-v1": "d5ZN+GNiazjgWlnr3WHikwraMvFljdUSLMgex4CGnc8=", "news_keywords": "Competition, horse, reining, National Reining Horse Association Futurity, Edmond, Copeland, okc, news 9, kwtv"}, "article_summary": "The Super Bowl of horse reining competitions is in Oklahoma City this weekend and millions of dollars are at stake.\nBut Lil Jerry died suddenly from colic.\nThe event is the 50th running of the National Reining Horse Association Futurity.\nAllen Copeland's horse died just before this weekend's big competition.\nCopeland rode his former horse, \"Lil Jerry Longlegs\", for two years and they recently qualified for the Futurity."}
