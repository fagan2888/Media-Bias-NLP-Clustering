West Wing has its own Obama Doctrine shorthand -- HAGEL IN AFGHANISTAN -- LEHANE, FABIANI update\n\nWelcome to June. BEHIND THE CURTAIN: For those pining for an Obama Doctrine victory for the president, here it is: \u201cDon't Do Stupid Shit.\u201d Playbook rarely prints a four-letter word -- our nephews are loyal readers. But we are, in this case, because that is the precise phrase President Obama and his aides are using in their off-the-record chats with journalists.\n\nIf the aim was to get this phrase in circulation to define the Obama doctrine, mission accomplished! It appeared in the L.A. Times at the end of Obama\u2019s Asia trip this spring, was reprised in the lead story of Thursday\u2019s New York Times, and is used TWICE in today\u2019s NYT -- once in the news columns, and once in a column by Tom Friedman, who was part of an off-the-record roundtable with Obama on Tuesday:\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n--MARK LANDLER on p. 4, \u201cWhite House Memo: In Obama\u2019s Speeches, a Shifting Tone on Terror\u201d: \u201cIn his second term, a time that presidents typically set about cementing their legacies as statesmen, Mr. Obama has instead settled on a minimalist foreign policy \u2014 one that he laid out at West Point and sums up with a saltier version of the phrase, \u2018don\u2019t do stupid stuff.\u2019 \u2018There is a fundamental and profound distinction between this speech and the earlier speeches,\u2019 said David J. Rothkopf, the publisher of Foreign Policy magazine. \u2018The Nobel Prize speech was infused with hope, ambition, and the desire to better the world. This speech is built around the idea of not doing stupid stuff.\u2019\u201d http://goo.gl/ZUbKcM\n\n--THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN in Sulaimaniya, Iraq, on SundayReview p. 11, \u201cObama\u2019s Foreign Policy Book: Here are a few working titles for the president\u2019s consideration\u201d: \u201cWhen President Obama sits down to write his foreign policy memoir he may be tempted to use as his book title the four words he reportedly uses privately to summarize the Obama doctrine: \u2018Don\u2019t Do Stupid Stuff\u2019 (with \u2018stuff\u2019 sometimes defined more spicily).\u201d http://goo.gl/GCHKjT\n\n--WHAT\u2019S CLEAR is that the White House is pushing this line hard, and effectively. What\u2019s not clear is how a high school clich\u00e9 will help successfully define a foreign policy that many on the right and left find soft and uninspired.\n\n--FLASHBACK 1 \u2013 Dylan Byers on Tuesday, \u201cObama holds private lunch with foreign policy journalists\u201d: \u201cPresident Obama held a private ninety-minute lunch meeting with foreign policy journalists on Tuesday \u2026 Over a chicken lunch in the Roosevelt Room, the president led a wide-ranging discussion on Afghanistan, his forthcoming commencement speech at West Point, and other foreign policy matters with the likes of Thomas Friedman, David Brooks, E.J. Dionne and Jeffrey Goldberg.\u201d http://goo.gl/LqukOG\n\n--FLASHBACK 2: Mark Landler, in the lead story of Thursday\u2019s Times: \u201cIn private conversations, the president has used a saltier variation of the phrase, \u2018don\u2019t do stupid stuff\u2019 \u2014 brushing aside as reckless those who say the United States should consider enforcing a no-fly zone in Syria or supplying arms to Ukrainian troops.\u201d http://goo.gl/WG20of\n\n--FLASHBACK 3: Christi Parsons, Kathleen Hennessey and Paul Richter in the L.A. Times and Chicago Tribune of April 29: \u201cThe president's aides have scrambled to put things in simpler terms. \u2018Don't do stupid stuff\u2019 is the polite-company version of a phrase they use to describe the president's foreign policy.\u201d\n\n--FLASHBACK 4: Christi Parsons and Kathleen Hennessey in the L.A. Times and Chicago Tribune last Sunday: \u201cPrivately, White House officials have described the working label for Obama's doctrine as \u2018Don't do stupid stuff.\u2019 Within the tight circle of foreign policy aides in the White House, the shorthand captured Obama's resistance to a rigid catch-all doctrine, as well as his aversion to what he once called the \u2018dumb war\u2019 in Iraq.\u201d\n\n--FLASHBACK 5: Steve Chapman of the Chicago Tribune editorial board, in Thursday\u2019s paper: \u201cInstead of trying to do great things, he's settled for a policy that his aides summarize as \u2018Don't do stupid stuff\u2019 -- though they use a different word than \u2018stuff.\u2019\u201d http://goo.gl/bPPaS6\n\n--FLASHBACK 6: In February, The Columbian newspaper of Vancouver, Wash., reported that it kept selling out of \u201cDon't Do Stupid Stuff\u201d mugs. http://goo.gl/9oQ8d3\n\nBREAKING \u2013 \u201cLewis Katz, co-owner of The Inquirer, dies in plane crash\u201d \u2013 Philly Inquirer: \u201cLewis Katz, 72, co-owner of The Philadelphia Inquirer, The Daily News and Philly.com, died Saturday night in the crash of a private jet at a Massachusetts airfield. \u2026 All seven people were killed aboard the private aircraft that crashed at Hanscom Field and erupted into a fireball \u2026 The Gulfstream IV crashed about 9:40 p.m. Saturday as it was departing for Atlantic City International Airport in New Jersey \u2026\n\n\u201cThe Boston Globe reported that Katz had attended an event in Concord, Mass., Saturday afternoon at the home of historian Doris Kearns Goodwin and her husband, Richard Goodwin. NBC10 was reporting that one of the passengers was Anne Leeds, 74, the wife of Longport commissioner Jim Leeds. Leeds told the Atlantic City Press that Katz had invited his wife, a former teacher, to the fundraiser in support of an education program created by the Goodwins' son Michael in the Concord Carlisle schools.\n\n\u201cOn Tuesday, Katz and H.F. \u2018Gerry\u2019 Lenfest bought out their partners for $88 million, gaining control of the media company that owns the Inquirer.\u201d http://goo.gl/I3wwVt\n\nCHRIS WALLACE, on \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d: \u201cBy the way, national security adviser Susan Rice is appearing on two Sunday Shows today [ABC\u2019s \u2018This Week\u2019 and CNN\u2019s \u2018State of the Union\u2019], but the White House still has not made her available to us since we interviewed her back in September of 2012, just five days after the Benghazi attack.\u201d\n\nPRINT-EDITION LEADS: NYT 2-col. lead, \u201cAMERICAN SOLDIER FREED BY TALIBAN IN PRISONER TRADE: U.S. Swaps 5 Guant\u00e1namo Detainees for the Only P.O.W. in Afghan War\u201d \u2026 WashPost banner, \u201cU.S. swaps 5 Taliban detainees for captive soldier: QATAR HELPS NEGOTIATE HIS RELEASE \u2013 Army sergeant held in Afghanistan nearly 5 years\u201d \u2026 L.A. Times 2-col. lead, \u201cU.S. soldier freed in swap with Taliban: Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, held captive since 2009, is released in a deal aided by Qatar.\u201d\n\nSUNDAY BEST \u2013 Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, from Bagram Air Base near Kabul in Afghanistan, to David Gregory on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d: \u201cI want to congratulate \u2026 all who had something to do with this. But also to thank the emir of Qatar, the Qatari government, and all the people in Qatar who helped make this occur. The transaction really was done by the Qatar government and the emir's commitment to getting that accomplished. We facilitated that in different ways. But in the interest of our own intelligence and procedures, I don't want to go much further than that.\u201d\n\nDAVID GREGORY: \u201c[D]oes this pave the way for perhaps a new round of negotiations with the Taliban, directly between the United States and the Taliban, about the Taliban's future in running Afghanistan?\u201d\n\nHAGEL: \u201cWell, it could, it might, and we hope it will present an opening. As you know, we have strongly supported an Afghan-led effort to come to an agreement with the Taliban. As you know, we had engaged with the Taliban up until 2012. They broke off those negotiations. We've had no formal relationship since then. So maybe this will be a new opening that can produce an agreement.\u201d\n\nDRIVING THE WEEK \u2013 \u201cUkraine showdown to shadow Obama in Europe,\u201d by AFP\u2019s Stephen Collinson: \u201cPresident Obama departs Washington late Monday on a trip to Europe ringing with historic echoes \u2026 The East-West showdown over Russia's annexation of Crimea \u2026 will dominate each stop of Obama's tour to Poland, the Group of Seven summit in Belgium and France for 70th anniversary commemorations of the D-Day landings. On the World War II battlefields in France, there will be several potentially awkward personal encounters between Obama and Russian President Vladimir Putin.\u201d http://goo.gl/y43bpY\n\n** A message from GE: For unique views on policy from the best in the news, check out gepressing.com, presented by GE. **\n\nBUZZ: Working behind the scenes for Steve Ballmer in his bid to own the L.A. Clippers: Mark Fabiani and Chris Lehane -- known for their deep ties into the sports world, political world and City of Angels world.\n\nUNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES \u2013 \u201cGOP\u2019s Obamacare fears come true,\u201d by Kyle Cheney and Jennifer Haberkorn: \u201c36 states rely on HealthCare.gov, the federal exchange, to enroll people in health coverage. At least two more states are opting in next year, with a few others likely to follow. Only two states are trying to get out. That\u2019s precisely the opposite of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s original intent: 50 exchanges run by 50 states. The federal option was supposed to be a limited and temporary fallback.\n\n\u201cBut a shift to a bigger, more permanent Washington-controlled system is instead underway \u2014 without preparation, funding or even public discussion about what a national exchange covering millions of Americans means for the future of U.S. health care. It\u2019s coming about because intransigent Republicans shunned state exchanges, and ambitious Democrats bungled them.\u201d http://goo.gl/gOIwpq\n\nBEYOND THE BELTWAY:\n\nCA GOV \u2013 L.A. Times A1, below fold, \u201cUSC DORNSIFE/TIMES POLL: Brown\u2019s GOP foes in dead heat: Kashkari\u2019s ad blitz appears to help him against Donnelly in Tuesday\u2019s primary,\u201d by Seema Mehta and Michael Finnegan: \u201cHalf of Californians deemed likely to vote \u2026 supported Brown's reelection. Among his chief challengers, both Republicans, Neel Kashkari was far behind at 18% and Tim Donnelly trailed at 13%. The difference \u2026 was within the \u2026 margin of error. Still, Kashkari's position represented a boost from earlier public polling that showed the political neophyte and former Treasury Department official trailing Donnelly, an assemblyman from San Bernardino County. The apparent movement suggested that Kashkari's recent blitz of television ads and glossy mailers was paying dividends.\u201d http://goo.gl/lWRZPq\n\nIA SEN \u2013 Des Moines Sunday Register lead story, \u201cIOWA POLL: A Register exclusive since 1943 \u2013 Ernest has big lead in GOP primary: Her support could be enough to win nomination outright,\u201d by Jennifer Jacobs: \u201cSelf-described \u2018mother, soldier, conservative\u2019 Joni Ernst is a convincing 18 points ahead of her closest GOP rival, \u2018proven business leader\u2019 Mark Jacobs, in the Republican race for U.S. Senate \u2026 Her support from 36 percent of likely GOP primary voters, which doubles Jacobs' 18 percent, would be enough to win Tuesday's five-person primary outright. The victor needs at least 35 percent.\u201d http://goo.gl/mJWTmg\n\nNH SEN -- Boston Sunday Globe A1, above fold, \u201cBrown got big stake in obscure Fla. firm: For advisory role, an award with initial worth of $1.3m,\u201d by Noah Bierman and Todd Wallack: \u201cAn obscure company in West Palm Beach that markets itself as a firearms manufacturer made a splashy announcement last summer: It was appointing Scott Brown \u2026 to its advisory board. \u2026 Brown received stock that was worth $1.3 million at the time. Its value has declined considerably since then, as the stock price has fallen by half. \u2026 It was founded as a beauty supply company in New Jersey \u2026 before reinventing itself as a wireless data firm from California and then again last year as a South Florida-based firearms maker \u2026\n\n\u201cIt is the kind of company, with scant assets and a shifting business model, that some financial professionals warn investors to steer away from. The company \u2026 has churned out press releases to attract small investors \u2026 and issued millions of shares of stock \u2026 During a brief encounter after a campaign event in Hopkinton, N.H., on Saturday, Brown declined to answer questions about his involvement with the company or the level of scrutiny he applied to its business methods before agreeing to associate himself with it.\u201d http://goo.gl/cyD6uL\n\nNY GOV -- DE BLASIO BACKS CUOMO IN HOUR OF NEED \u2013 \u201cDespite dustup, NY Gov Cuomo gets liberal backing,\u201d by AP\u2019s David Klepper in Albany: \u201cGov. Andrew Cuomo beat back a challenge from the left Saturday, narrowly winning the nomination of the Working Families Party with a promise to support liberal priorities while taking on state senators who have blocked them. \u2026 The governor did not appear at the convention but spoke to delegates over the phone. He promised to support liberal priorities including a minimum wage hike, the decriminalization of small amounts of marijuana and public campaign financing. \u2026\n\n\u201cCuomo got a boost from [Mayor Bill] de Blasio, \u2026 who personally vouched for Cuomo and told delegates that the governor is too powerful an ally to reject.\u201d http://goo.gl/wgsdcO\n\n--BEING THERE \u2013 \u201cWFP leaders urge skeptical members to support Cuomo,\u201d by Capital New York\u2019s Laura Nahmias: \u201cEmma Wolfe, a top aide to Mayor Bill De Blasio, huddled with state Attorney General Eric Schneiderman. \u2026 In the billiards room just off the the hotel\u2019s foyer, state committee and party members sprawled across the hotel\u2019s pool tables with markers and posterboard, producing anti-Cuomo signs that read \u2018No to Cuomoccio\u2019 \u2026 A popular sign, which many convention attendees had taped to their shirts, expressed skepticism of a potential deal with Cuomo. It read: \u2018I am a non-believer. Do you believe?\u2019\u201d http://goo.gl/i97ZWA\n\nWEEKEND WEDDING \u2013 Caitlin Dunn and Alex Conant \u2013 N.Y.
