It\u2019s totally rebuilt itself,\u201d said Ambition co-founder Jared Houghton, referring to the southern city\u2019s focus in recent years on providing fast Internet service and nurturing entrepreneurship. \u201cIt\u2019s much cheaper to operate here and we get great talent.\u201d\n\nSeeded with $600,000 from Chattanooga venture incubator Lamp Post Group, Ambition aims to improve on leaderboards, badges and other trappings of early gamification efforts.\n\nAmbition allows customers to define the things they care about for each employee function, like the number of leads generated, demos and deal closings, and then track them by pulling from emails, phone calls and other sources. In this way, each employee is assigned their own \u201cambition\u201d score, allowing them to compete independently and as part of a team, despite having different jobs.\n\nThe startup is in the process of integrating its software to pull data from Salesforce.com\u2019s platform and may explore other data sources as well, Mr. Houghton said.\n\nAmbition sells the software as a service to companies for between $20 and $30 per employee per month.\n\nMr. Houghton said Ambition employs 13 now and he expects to hire another five or 10 during the next six months. Current customers include phone repair startup iCracked.com Inc. and logistics and shipping companies including Access America Transport Inc. and GlobalTranz Enterprises Inc.\n\n\u201cWe [will] sell into Fortune 500 companies in Atlanta, Minneapolis and in Chicago,\u201d Mr. Houghton said, adding the target customers\u2019 locations were another reason for leaving Silicon Valley for Chattanooga. \u201cIt\u2019s not like we\u2019re a consumer app.\u201d\n\nInvestors also include High Line Venture Partners, Redpoint Ventures, Promus Ventures, Initialized Capital, Acequia Capital and individuals including Paul Buchheit, Justin Kan, Ryan and David Petersen, Anand Swaminathan, Patrick and John Collison, and Bobby Goodlatte.\n\nCORRECTION 6/4/14: This story was changed to correct the name of Ambition Solutions Inc.\n\nWrite to Lizette Chapman at lizette.chapman@wsj.com.
