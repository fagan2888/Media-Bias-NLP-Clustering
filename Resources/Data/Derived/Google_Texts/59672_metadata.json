Definition: Completely dominated by an opponent.\n\nUgh. It was ugly. Vlad drove the lane and dunked in BO\u2019s face \u2014 then dissed his mother.\n\nIf ESPN showed the whole thing on replay, they\u2019d go to super slo-mo at the end and some jock announcer would say, \u201cBoom! Right there! Watch the head fake \u2014 skadoosh! Someone go pick up Obama\u2019s jockstrap!\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s recap: The 44th president gets his undies all in a wad after someone fires off some chemical weapons in Syria and kills 1,400 \u2014 never mind that 100,000 have died in the\n\n2\u00bd-year-long civil war there, BO was up in Martha\u2019s Vineyard on the golf course when the gas hit, so that really ruined his game and wrecked his fun beach time. Someone must pay!\n\nSo the president announced he was going to fight a Democrat-style war, you know, lob a few bombs in, reduce an aspirin factory to rubble, but just for a few days, not so long it would push back next weekend\u2019s tee time. Boots on the ground? Hell no. Maybe no boots in the air, either: Just some drones, bombing some rocks in the desert, enough to make us all feel good at next weekend\u2019s cocktail party that someone somewhere was paying a hefty price for using those chemical weapons. For the children, darn it!\n\nThen, seriously, the president went to play golf. Right after his urgent announcement. Urgency schmurgency.\n\nCongress, meanwhile, wondered what all the urgent rhetoric was about.\n\nWait, it gets so much better. Then, days later, the president said, don\u2019t worry: It\u2019s not like, BOMBING bombing. It\u2019s a limited action \u2014 we don\u2019t want to, say, topple the guy responsible for gassing 500 children, we want to hit the three D\u2019s: Degrade, Deter, Drive It 300 Yards: Wait, just two D\u2019s.\n\nThe president said he had the mojo to go, but, just to be a total bro, he was gonna get the \u201call good\u201d from his peeps in Congress. Unless they no go-ed. Then would he go? Wouldn\u2019t say. So just be cool and get on board, eh?\n\nBut Congress balked (maybe it was the phone calls running 100-1 against going to war in, where again, Syria?). And while the mainstream media busied itself bashing the GOP for suddenly hating war, it was the Cocktail Party Left (CPL) that really didn\u2019t want to muss its hair in Syria. Or ruin the weekend.\n\nSo, to the rescue, a warrior: swift boat cap\u2019n John F. Kerry. During 1,259 hours of Senate hearings (over two days), the Vietnam vet who hated war (and, really, the American military as well, and, frankly, himself) said, no no, wait, whoa: This attack on Syria will be a pinprick, \u201cunbelievably small.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the president was in Sweden. Why? Who knows. \u201cI didn\u2019t set a red line, the world set a red line,\u201d he said about the red line he set when he set the red line on Syrian chemical weapons. The next day, he was heading to Russia, but he wouldn\u2019t be meeting with that ol\u2019 meanie face Putin. That guy was being nice to an American who divulged an expansive U.S. program that, like the old USSR days, spies on all homeland citizens. Phooey to him.\n\nSo, despite the big \u201creset\u201d of relations with Russia, Mr. Obama snubbed its president in his own country, called him a slouching schoolboy, then showed up late for dinner, miffing the host. Too soon, playtime in St. Petersburg was over and the president came home to D.C. and returned to \u2014 work, you\u2019re thinking? No, the golf course.\n\nBack to the rescue came Secretary of State Kerry. Asked whether Syrian President Bashar Assad could do anything to avert the coming pinprick, Lurch said: \u201cSure, he could turn over every single bit of his chemical weapons to the international community in the next week.\u201d Boom, another red line. But the State Department quickly said, \u201cno red, no red.\u201d Instead, their high school spokeswoman Jen Psaki said Mr. Kerry was merely making a \u201crhetorical argument.\u201d\n\nToo late. Mr. Putin jumped in and offered to help broker the deal. In fact, he\u2019d lead the whole thing \u2014 and take credit for it, too. But the White House said, wait, it was really our idea from the get-go, and when we had a secret meeting in Russia with Pooty Poot, we brought it up \u2014 first!\n\nIn the end, Congress bailed (don\u2019t expect a Syria vote), Mr. Obama and Mr. Kerry embarrassed themselves again, and Mr. Putin ended up lecturing America \u2014 in The New York Times, no less \u2014 about the misguided notion of American exceptionalism. Oh, and then the Russian president headed to Iran for some talks on helping the rogue nation get its nuclear program up and running.\n\nStill, who could\u2019ve seen such a development? Um, Mitt Romney. \u201cRussia is, without question, our No. 1 geopolitical foe. They fight every cause for the world\u2019s worst actors,\u201d the Republican presidential candidate said six months before the 2012 election.\n\nAnd how did Mr. Obama respond: \u201cThe 1980s,\u201d he said in a debate, \u201care now calling to ask for their foreign policy back because the Cold War\u2019s been over for 20 years.\u201d\n\nHardcore pwned.\n\n\u2022 Joseph Curl covered the White House and politics for a decade for The Washington Times and is now editor of the Drudge Report.
