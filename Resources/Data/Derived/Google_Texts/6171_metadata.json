Ted Cruz (R-TX) made his case Saturday for why he was a top-tier candidate.\n\nCruz has claimed he's built his firewall in southern states, many of which will hold their primaries on March 1. Yet, Trump managed to chip away at some of Cruz's evangelical support, a sign of the fight ahead.\n\nCruz declared Saturday that he was far and away the most conservative man left standing in the race for the Republican nomination.\n\n\"There is only one candidate who has led the fight against amnesty, who has led the fight against Obamacare, who has led the fight to defend life and marriage and religious liberty,\" Cruz said.\n\nHe added that \"if you are a conservative,this is where you belong.\"\n\nCruz took a moment at the beginning of his remarks to recognize Jeb Bush's contribution to the race after the former Florida governor dropped out. He also asked for a moment from the audience to remember the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, whose funeral Cruz attended Saturday.\n\nNow Cruz will move onto contests in Nevada and then Super Tuesday on March 1.\n\n\"You can go with Washington deal makers or we can stand together with a proven, consistent Constitutional conservative and bring back morning in America,\" Cruz said.", "article_metadata": {"p": {"domain_verify": "da088b457e7d0e91a9f692968f1043c1"}, "og": {"site_name": "Talking Points Memo", "description": "As the race for the Republican nomination narrows, Sen.
