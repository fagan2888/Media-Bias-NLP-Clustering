Created a study committee and approved clinical research. Doesn\u2019t provide a legal mean to obtain cannabis-derived products.\n\nThe Put Patients First Act: Introduced on Jan. 13, 2015. If passed, would create a program for marijuana growth, cultivation, testing, quality assurance and dispensing of the drug for medicinal purposes. The bill is under review in a state judiciary committee.\n\nSen. Tom Davis\u2019 bill: To be introduced this month. Would create a highly regulated program to monitor all medical marijuana growth and prescription. Would give doctors the ultimate choice to prescribe and would protect patients who use the drug from prosecution.\n\nCompassionate Access, Research Expansion and Respect States Act of 2015: Federal bill introduced March 10, 2015. If passed would allow patients, doctors and businesses in states that have already passed medical marijuana laws to participate in those programs without fear of federal prosecution.
