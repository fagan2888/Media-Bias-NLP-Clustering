Conservation quickly became one of Roosevelt\u2019s concerns, and during his presidency he established four national game preserves, five national parks and 150 national forests in acts that protected about 230 million acres of public land.\n\nAlthough he failed to make the Grand Canyon a national park, Roosevelt used the American Antiquities Act of 1906 to proclaim the canyon and 17 other sites as national monuments.\n\n\u201cWhen you think about things like Westward Expansion and exploration of the continent, it was really the Indian lands that were being discovered,\u201d Balsom said. \u201cThe railroad came to the Grand Canyon in 1901 and there were several attempts to set it aside as protected land because it was already being overrun with enterprise\u2014with hotels, shantytowns, that all were about expanding the opportunity.\u201d\n\nRoosevelt in 1903 recognized the Grand Canyon as something that needed protection from logging, mining and other damaging enterprises. In a statement he made during a visit to the canyon that year, Roosevelt called on Americans to help preserve the unique gorge that formed during six million years of erosion.\n\n\u201cLet this great wonder of nature remain as it now is,\u201d he said. \u201cDo nothing to mar its grandeur, sublimity and loveliness. You cannot improve on it. But what you can do is to keep it for your children, your children\u2019s children, and all who come after you, as the one great sight which every American should see.\u201d\n\nBy declaring it a national monument, Roosevelt took the first steps to remove the canyon from the public arena and protect it from development, Balsom said. He also cleared the way for it to become a national park in 1919\u2014three years after the creation of the National Park Service\u2014and for the federal government to help protect tribal lands located within and adjacent to the park.\n\n\u201cThe Grand Canyon is protected for all time, so in a way the tribal land is protected,\u201d Balsom said. \u201cWe have a responsibility to preserve this place, and tribes, in some ways, look to us to do our job. We have a job to protect the Grand Canyon in perpetuity.\u201d\n\nEleven tribes, including the Havasupai, have geographic or cultural claims to the canyon. The Hopi, Hualapai, Navajo, Paiute and Zuni tribes have cultural claims to the 1.2-million-acre national park, while the Havasupai tribe actually lives in the canyon system.\n\nIn a 2007 interview, Roland Manakaja, a resident of the Havasupai village of Supai, located in the bottom of Havasu Canyon, talked about growing up without a knowledge of the outside world. Although part of the Grand Canyon system, Havasu Canyon is outside the boundary and jurisdiction of the National Park Service.\n\nIn the 1950s and \u201860s, Supai residents rarely saw visitors, Manakaja said. As a youth, he was unacquainted with outsiders or their ways. Even neighboring tribes had no idea there was a tribe living in the canyon, he said.\n\nQuoting a Havasupai prophecy, Manakaja said his people\u2014and the canyon\u2014were destined to be \u201chidden from the public eye.\u201d\n\nThe prophecy states that should the canyon be made public, \u201cthe water, the environment would be degraded, devastated, contaminated and polluted for one\u2019s gain,\u201d Manakaja said. \u201cWhoever that one person was had a lot of power, had a lot of money. That isn\u2019t the way it\u2019s supposed to work. It\u2019s supposed to work in a way where the gain goes to everyone\u2014the children, elders, with respect to the past, the present and the future.\u201d\n\nApproximately 5 million people visit the Grand Canyon on a yearly basis, with more than 20,000 of them traversing the last eight miles to the canyon where the Havasupai live. Supai is accessible only by foot, horseback or helicopter.\n\nThe National Park Service tries to maintain cooperative relationships with all tribes and uphold Roosevelt\u2019s plea that people do not \u201cmar the \u2026 great loneliness and beauty of the canyon.\u201d\n\nAlthough the park service and the Havasupai tribe operate visitor\u2019s centers, museums and other services for tourists, efforts are being made to preserve the canyon\u2019s sacred cultural histories, Balsom said. A medallion on the floor of the visitor\u2019s center includes the names of all tribes affiliated with the Grand Canyon, she said.\n\n\u201cThe tribes helped design it, and everyone who comes to the visitor\u2019s center has to walk over it to see the canyon,\u201d she said. \u201cThe medallion represents the continuity of our relationship with tribes and it honors the fact that Indians are the present and the future of this country, not just the past.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "On January 11, 1908, President Theodore Roosevelt declared the Grand Canyon a national monument, placing under federal protection the sacred site.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "leeanne", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/01/11/native-history-roosevelt-declares-grand-canyon-national-monument-153056", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/grand-canyon-aerial.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "Native History: Roosevelt Declares Grand Canyon a National Monument"}, "dcterms.date": "2014-01-11T10:00-05:00", "dc": {"title": "Native History: Roosevelt Declares Grand Canyon a National Monument"}, "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/01/11/native-history-roosevelt-declares-grand-canyon-national-monument-153056", "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "President Theodore Roosevelt, Native American Sacred Sites, Grand Canyon, Havasupai, National Park Service", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.title": "Native History: Roosevelt Declares Grand Canyon a National Monument"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb24b\"", "article_summary": "Although he failed to make the Grand Canyon a national park, Roosevelt used the American Antiquities Act of 1906 to proclaim the canyon and 17 other sites as national monuments.\nAlthough part of the Grand Canyon system, Havasu Canyon is outside the boundary and jurisdiction of the National Park Service.\nThis Date in Native History: On January 11, 1908, President Theodore Roosevelt declared the Grand Canyon a national monument, placing under federal protection the 10-mile-wide, 277-mile-long and one-mile-deep canyon that for thousands of years had been held sacred by Indigenous Peoples.\nWe have a job to protect the Grand Canyon in perpetuity.\u201dEleven tribes, including the Havasupai, have geographic or cultural claims to the canyon.\n\u201cThe railroad came to the Grand Canyon in 1901 and there were several attempts to set it aside as protected land because it was already being overrun with enterprise\u2014with hotels, shantytowns, that all were about expanding the opportunity.\u201dRoosevelt in 1903 recognized the Grand Canyon as something that needed protection from logging, mining and other damaging enterprises."}
