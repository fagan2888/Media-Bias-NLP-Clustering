While the military was initially able to coast on previous investments, the index notes that these budget cuts are beginning to take a toll on equipment, training, and personnel needs.\n\n>>> Read the full 2016 Index of U.S. Military Strength\n\nOf the four military branches, the Army has taken the biggest hit, receiving a \u201cweak\u201d rating in the index\u2019s evaluation after years of budget cuts have forced reductions in troops. This has diminished the Army to its smallest size since prior to World War II.\n\nThe Air Force\u2019s rating also dropped, falling into the \u201cmarginal\u201d category as many of its planes near the end of their usable lifespan.\n\nWood said inadequate funding has left the Air Force unable to modernize much of its equipment and to provide adequate flight programs and training for its pilots.\n\nMeanwhile, the index found that the global threat environment has worsened.\n\nFor the first time, North Korea was rated as a \u201csevere\u201d threat to the U.S. after the nation made advancements in ballistic missile technologies, leaving it with nuclear weapons capable of reaching American facilities and allies in the region.\n\nFurther, China continues to act aggressively, evidenced most recently in its island-building in the South China Sea, while Russia remains assertively involved in Ukraine and Syria.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at what China and Russia bring to the table in terms of state capacity, to be able to operate at scale across continental size land-masses with large inventories and munitions of very robust and mature capabilities, it\u2019s a different kind of threat\u2014it\u2019s more enduring, and it\u2019s more profound,\u201d Wood said.\n\nHe said as these threats endure while budget caps force the military to shrink, leaving it unable to modernize, it strains national security resources and leaves American interests in a weakened position.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Why that matters.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Why that matters.", "title": "US Continues to Slash Its Military Budget", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151028_MilitaryIndex_Johnson.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-10-28T18:21:58+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1RBULzi"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Why that matters.", "title": "US Continues to Slash Its Military Budget", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151028_MilitaryIndex_Johnson.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Security", "tag": "military", "published_time": "2015-10-28T17:15:20+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-28T18:21:58+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "military, Index of U.S. Military Strength, Dakota Wood, budget"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd06f2\"", "article_summary": "The military\u2019s budget has been slashed 15 percent during the past four years.\nThe United States is scaling back its military while nations hostile to American interests continue to grow in strength and aggression, according to The Heritage Foundation\u2019s annual Index of U.S. Military Strength, released Wednesday.\nHe said as these threats endure while budget caps force the military to shrink, leaving it unable to modernize, it strains national security resources and leaves American interests in a weakened position.\n>>> Read the full 2016 Index of U.S. Military StrengthOf the four military branches, the Army has taken the biggest hit, receiving a \u201cweak\u201d rating in the index\u2019s evaluation after years of budget cuts have forced reductions in troops.\nWhile the military was initially able to coast on previous investments, the index notes that these budget cuts are beginning to take a toll on equipment, training, and personnel needs."}
