Adoption rates were highest among millennials, at 44%, and lower among older generations.\n\nBut though high-deductible plans appear to be making inroads in the health care landscape, the report found that employees are under-utilizing health savings accounts, which accompany high-deductible plans and allow for tax-exempt savings earmarked for medical expenses.\n\nThose with high-deductible plans put aside less than half of the maximum amount in their HSAs, even though HSA dollars carry over to the next year, unlike with flexible spending accounts.\n\nBoth younger and older users saved less than they could in HSAs, but the trend was particularly acute for millennials: the average individual 25-year-old only put aside 22% of the 2016 limit.\n\nThe report found that few large employers, only 6%, offered solely high-deductible plans, an unexpected trend given predictions that employers would offer only high-deductible plans to keep costs down\n\nThe research also found that a minority of large employers using the Benefitfocus platform, or 36%, offered at least one voluntary benefit to employees, and an even smaller percentage of employees\u201414%-- actually enrolled in that benefit.\n\nSuch benefits\u2014which include critical illness, hospital indemnity and accident insurance\u2014are paid for by employees, but employer participation allows for lower rates than employees could access on their own.\n\nThe Benefitfocus report pulled from more than 700,000 employee records across about 500 large employers in 2015, only using data from those who enrolled through the company\u2019s online benefits enrollment platform. The companies studied bridged various industries, including education, health care, pharmaceuticals and biotechnology and manufacturing.\n\nSubsequent reports will examine the small and midsize markets, as well as industry-specific health care benefits.\n\nMore from MarketWatch", "article_metadata": {"lifp_basePath": "https://id.marketwatch.com/access", "twitter": {"domain": "marketwatch.com", "description": "A new report finds that high-deductible plans are making inroads among employers and employees.", "creator": "@emmarcourt", "image": {"width": 1320, "identifier": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-EF611_checku_ZG_20160216113452.jpg", "height": 742}, "site": {"id": 624413}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "parsely-author": "Emma Court", "article.content_group": "marketwatch", "article.section": "Personal Finance", "parsely-type": "post", "description": "A new report finds that high-deductible plans are making inroads among employers and employees.", "parsely-link": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/this-is-what-your-health-insurance-looks-like-this-year-2016-02-16", "author": "Emma Court", "parsely-title": "This is what your health insurance looks like this year", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=336693422", "parsely-pub-date": "2016-02-16T12:31:00-05:00", "page.site": "marketwatch", "robots": "noarchive,noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 283204329838}, "parsely-section": "MW_Personal Finance", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "og": {"site_name": "MarketWatch", "description": "A new report finds that high-deductible plans are making inroads among employers and employees.", "title": "This is what your health insurance looks like this year", "url": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/this-is-what-your-health-insurance-looks-like-this-year-2016-02-16", "image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-EF611_checku_ZG_20160216113452.jpg", "type": "article"}, "ob": {"image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-EF611_checku_ZG_20160216113452.jpg"}, "article.id": "47F36712-D4A8-11E5-9AFC-676FBE349BB9", "position": 1}, "article_summary": "First introduced as an insurance option by the Affordable Care Act, high-deductible plans offer smaller monthly premiums but higher caps on out-of-pocket health expenses.\nSubsequent reports will examine the small and midsize markets, as well as industry-specific health care benefits.\nThe companies studied bridged various industries, including education, health care, pharmaceuticals and biotechnology and manufacturing.\nBut though high-deductible plans appear to be making inroads in the health care landscape, the report found that employees are under-utilizing health savings accounts, which accompany high-deductible plans and allow for tax-exempt savings earmarked for medical expenses.\nThose with high-deductible plans put aside less than half of the maximum amount in their HSAs, even though HSA dollars carry over to the next year, unlike with flexible spending accounts."}
