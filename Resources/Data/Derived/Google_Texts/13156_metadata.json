AUGUSTINE, Fla. - St. Johns County Sheriff's Office on Tuesday arrested a 20-year-old St. Augustine man for impersonating a law enforcement officer.\n\n\n\nDeputies say a detective in an unmarked vehicle noticed a police interceptor model 1999 Ford Crown Victoria traveling at a low rate of speed on International Golf Parkway about 8:30 p.m. Monday. As Detective Justin \"Chance\" Anderson legally passed the vehicle, he realized the car had red and blue lights activated, according to the St. Johns County report.\n\nAnderson pulled over and the Crown Victoria drove by. Anderson then made a traffic stop on the suspect vehicle and identified the driver as Matthew Michael Lee McMahon.\n\nDeputies say McMahon provided numerous statements on the roadside as to why he was in possession of emergency lights.\n\nOnce Anderson determined McMahon has never been a certified law enforcement officer, he was charged with impersonating a law enforcement officer and unlawfully displaying blue lights. He was booked into the St. Johns County Detention Facility on $5,500 bond.\n\nCopyright 2014 by News4Jax.com. All rights reserved.
