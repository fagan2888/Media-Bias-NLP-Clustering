Liberty Tax Service is hosting their first Christmas dinner for local families Friday.

Staff at the Chipley office have spent the past few days turning their office in to a dining area. The event will run from 3 p.m. until 6 p.m.

Volunteers will serve a variety of food in what they're calling a "good southern dinner". They'll have ham, turkey, peas, and cornbread, just to name a few.

They're also handing out gifts to children.

"We don't know of anyone who does a public event like this at no cost," store owner Penny Corley explained. "We know there are quite a few needy people in the area and even those that are not needy. So we want to do this as a service to our community and just allow everybody to come out and celebrate the holiday."

The staff are prepared for 150 people to attend. They'll also be available to answer question people may have about their taxes.
