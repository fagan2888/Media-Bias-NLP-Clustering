There are several new forms all relating to Obamacare. One form that many taxpayers may receive is IRS Form 1095-A Health Insurance Marketplace Statement. If you applied for health insurance through one of exchanges on the Health Insurance Marketplace, you\u2019ll receive this form.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nThe form is not issued by the IRS. It is issued by the Marketplace where you purchased your health insurance coverage. The forms were issued at the end of January, so you will likely have received it by early February. If you did not receive the form (many did not), contact the Marketplace directly to obtain a copy. You will need this form when completing your income tax return.\n\nForm 1095-A provides the dates of coverage, the amounts you spent each month for the coverage, who in your household was covered and other information needed to complete IRS Form 8962 Premium Tax Credit. The information on the 1095-A will be used to reconcile advance payments of the premium tax credit made on your behalf to your insurance provider and to calculate the premium tax credit you are claiming on your tax return.\n\nYou may receive more than one Form 1095-A if different members of your household had different health plans or if you updated your coverage information during the year or if you changed plans during 2014.

What do certain terms mean (e.g., Second Lowest Cost Silver Plan)? What do I do with this form once I\u2019ve filled it out? How can I use this form to file my 2014 tax return? Is my 1095-A form correct (and what do I do if it\u2019s not)?\n\nMorales states, \u201cThis is a new concept for everybody. It\u2019s important to seek help because it is a complicated process and there are many new tax forms involved.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"classification": "/FOX BUSINESS/COLUMNS/Taxpertise,/FOX
