Last year, Regan Wheeler took home a fourth-place finish in the Barrel Racing during the annual Jim Mason Memorial Roping and Barrel Race event.

Fast forward a year to Sunday where Wheeler, the 2014 Miss Rodeo Logan County, highlighted yet another fun-filled afternoon of roping and riding at the Jim Mason Memorial — an unofficial kick-off to the 2014 Logan County Fair activities — as she earned her first ever Logan County Fair rodeo event victory.

Wheeler posted a time of 15.896 seconds, just edging out Kari Mueller's time of 16 seconds flat and Taya McAdow's 16.06, to take the top spot in barrel racing.

"I've been working hard with this mare I have, 'Rocket,' and she is kind of hitting a new gear, so that's exciting," said Wheeler, who will be competing on the Northeastern Junior College rodeo team this year. "I'm preparing for college rodeo, so it feels good that she is being consistent. It feels really good (to win). This is my first time winning at the county (fair)."

Team roping acted as the main event on Sunday, with over 80 registered teams each taking their turn in the arena.

Nine teams made it to the third go round with a chance to win, but it was the team of Chris Anderson and Michael Shaffer, who led after the second round, that would hold on for the first-place finish.
