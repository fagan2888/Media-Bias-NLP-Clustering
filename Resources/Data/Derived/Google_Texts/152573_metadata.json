On the surface, the CFPB says it is:\n\n\u201cA 21st Century agency that helps consumer finance markets work by making rules more effective, by consistently and fairly enforcing those rules, and by empowering consumers to take more control over their economic lives.\u201d\n\nWe have 20th Century bureaucracies that say they do this but who\u2019s counting.\n\nThe difference between the old and new has to do with the access the CFPB has to the personal finances of all Americans. It has access to their mortgage payments and details, credit card statements and details, auto loan payments and details \u2013 in effect anything you own and details.\n\nThe news media and politicians fret about the NSA\u2019s domestic spying program, whether the government can scoop up meta data of all the people you call, when and for how long and the gathering face recognition, retina scans, fingerprints and other biometric data on the people by the government but not a word about government intrusion on the financial lives of all Americans.\n\nWhat people don\u2019t know and what a new polls reveals is that people recoil in anger when they learn that, under CFPB rules, the government is collecting identifiable financial data of each American that gives government bureaucrats an intimate picture of a person\u2019s financial status at any point in time.\n\nIf the CFPB teams up with the Internal Revenue Service, ObamaCare, the U.S. Census Bureau, the National Security Agency (NSA), the Federal Communications Commission\u2019s recent takeover of the Internet and the U.S. banking system and there is no part of your life that you own.\n\nYour privacy is not just dead. It\u2019s buried.\n\nThe poll, conducted by the U.S. Consumer Coalition (USCC), a grassroots organization that works to protect consumers\u2019 rights to access free-market goods and services, is the first national survey about the CFPB and how Americans feel about the agency once they find out what it does.\n\nThe poll showed that an overwhelming majority of Americans want to see the CFPB subject to congressional oversight through the appropriations process.\n\n\u201cAmericans have spoken loudly for the first time in this survey that they believe this agency is invading their privacy and restricting their freedom of choice in a way that makes them very uncomfortable,\u201d said Brian Wise, Senior Advisor to the U.S. Consumer Coalition.\n\nAccording to a press release, the USCC commissioned the nationwide survey of 3,225 likely voters and 3,604 adults to better understand how Americans feel about the CFPB. Key Findings of the USCC-Zogby Analytics Poll include:\n\n\u2022 A majority (55%) of respondents believe the CFPB\u2019s data collection program is similar or worse than the controversial NSA monitoring program.\n\n\u2022 Only 20% of those polled believed that the CFPB should be able to collect and review Americans\u2019 credit card statements without their knowledge.\n\n\u2022 78% of respondents believe the CFPB should have to seek Congressional approval for its budget like other agencies.\n\n\u2022 Nearly 70% of those polled believe that the government should not be able to tell consumers how to spend their money or make financial decisions for their families.\n\n\u2022 71% agreed that it is the consumer\u2019s responsibility to determine whether or not to take out loans and mortgages with unfavorable terms as long as they are presented clearly.\n\n\u201cWe have a powerful agency unilaterally regulating products and industries while subjecting Americans to an unprecedented invasion of their personal financial data. And it\u2019s clear Americans don\u2019t like it,\u201d said Wise. \u201cThey clearly oppose the agency\u2019s activities to invade their privacy, track their purchases, and efforts to tell them what products they can and cannot use.\u201d\n\nContinuing from the release:\n\n\u201cThe CFPB has come under fire in recent months for proposing controversial regulations of consumer financial products without congressional approval. The CFPB instituted a program to acquire and monitor the purchases of more than 500 million credit cards of American consumers. The CFPB has also refused to provide information to Congress on the purpose of the data collection program, or agree to allow Americans an opportunity to opt-out.\u201d \u201cConsumers are increasingly against the government telling them how to spend their money and are skeptical of the claim that mountains of their personal data are needed to keep them safe \u2013 not from terrorists in this case \u2013 but from themselves and their own choices. USCC hopes that this survey will raise awareness about a number of the questionable activities of the CFPB and serve as a catalyst for real reform to protect America\u2019s consumers from the so-called \u2018consumer protector.'\u201d\n\nBased on these findings, Americans are sending a clear message to Congress, the President and the bureaucracies he controls \u2013 BUTT OUT!", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hidden away in Obama\u2019s legislative achievements \u2013 somewhere between ObamaCare and his $700 billion stimulus spending law is the creation of a new agency.", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "author": "Bob Conover", "og": {"site_name": "Liberty News Now", "description": "Hidden away in Obama\u2019s legislative achievements \u2013 somewhere between ObamaCare and his $700 billion stimulus spending law is the creation of a new agency.", "title": "Americans Hate New Government Agency That Monitors Spending", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://www.libertynewsnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/money-being-watched.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-06-20T12:12:13+00:00", "url": "http://www.libertynewsnow.com/poll-says-americans-hate-new-government-agency-that-monitors-their-spending/article1630", "type": "article"}, "robots": "noodp", "ca_image": "http://www.libertynewsnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/money-being-watched-150x150.jpg", "article": {"section": "Featured", "tag": "NSA", "published_time": "2015-06-20T10:00:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-20T12:12:13+00:00"}, "ca_title": "Poll Says Americans Hate New Government Agency That Monitors Their Spending", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWe have a powerful agency unilaterally regulating products and industries while subjecting Americans to an unprecedented invasion of their personal financial data.\nThe president wanted to create the \u201cconsumer protection\u201d agency to do what other federal agencies already do only better \u2013 protect consumers from themselves.\nThe difference between the old and new has to do with the access the CFPB has to the personal finances of all Americans.\n'\u201dBased on these findings, Americans are sending a clear message to Congress, the President and the bureaucracies he controls \u2013 BUTT OUT!\nThe poll showed that an overwhelming majority of Americans want to see the CFPB subject to congressional oversight through the appropriations process."}
