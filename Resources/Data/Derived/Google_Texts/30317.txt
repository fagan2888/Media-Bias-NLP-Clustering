Sioux Falls, SD

The Sanford Pentagon has been through its two biggest tests. After it showcased an NBA exhibition game workers were able to learn and fix any kinks. Needless to say they didn't disappoint on opening night of the college basketball season.

All 3,250 seats were full at the Sanford Pentagon as fans from all over packed in to watch Wisconsin take on St. Johns. These two power houses have played in spectacular venues all over the world, but maybe nothing like the $19 million facility they stepped into Friday night.

"It's as good of a venue as I've been to. From the locker rooms, to all the state of the art bells and whistles, and from a design stand point its first rate," St. John's Head Coach Steve Lavin said.

Wisconsin gave up a home game to play in Sioux Falls where the school has ties with the Krabbenhoft family. The Badgers also received a check for $260,000 for making the trip. Another positive is tapping into South Dakota's young basketball players.

"There are good players everywhere, but if there are some real good ones that want to take a look at Wisconsin we're not that far away. Us coming up here getting a little paycheck for the school, giving our alumni and others a chance to see us play, it's very positive," Wisconsin Head Coach Bo Ryan said.

Badger alum Ryan Evans was on hand. Evans, a 2013 graduate, was in attendance not only to check out his former team, but also to check out his new home. The 6-6 forward was acquired by the Skyforce earlier in the week.

"It's amazing. Kelby Krabbenhoft did a great job with the arena. I'm excited to play here. They say it sells out every game, so there is no better place to be in the D-League," Skyforce Forward Ryan Evans said.

You can Evans and the rest of the new look Skyforce in their season opener at the Pentagon Friday Nov. 22 and Saturday Nov. 23 against Reno. Tip off is set for 7 o'clock.
