The Marion Police Department is spending their Christmas Eve by giving back to the citizens they serve every day by caroling and donating toys to children.

“We have been doing this for several years now but each year it gets bigger and bigger,” explained Marion Police Chief Randall Davis, “so next year if everything works out it could even be bigger and we could serve the community a lot more.”

Member of the police department and volunteers from the community started their day off singing Christmas carols with residents of the Beehive Assisted Living Facility, then returned to Town Hall so children could pick out a couple of toys to have on this day before Christmas.

“They have done a wonderful job organizing this,” explained Marion Town Alderman, Lisa Lindley, “It is just so wonderful to see those little children’s faces light up when they get a new bike or new doll and I am just so proud to be a citizen of the town and not just an alderman and I really am proud and blessed that we are showing the true spirit of Christmas and that is giving.”

The Police Department has been working for past several months on their annual toy drive and it was a community wide effort to make sure town hall was filled with toys and Police Chief Randall Davis is glad to bring joy to children during the holidays.

“It makes me feel great, because that is what we are here for is the kids and I remember when I was a little boy, Christmas meant a lot to me and so this is not hard to know how they are going to feel, you know, we have all been there,” explained Davis.

In the end, Chief Davis wants to continue holding community events to let the Town of Marion know that they are there for their citizens.

“We all know that police is there to really just try to curb and prevent crime but we are here to serve also and this is part of our service right here in this community and as long as we are out here, this is what Marion police plan is to stay in the community and help out as much as possible,” explained Davis.
