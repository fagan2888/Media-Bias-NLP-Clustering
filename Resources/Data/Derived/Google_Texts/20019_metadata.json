Andrew Cuomo told WCNY radio host Susan Arbetter over the weekend that \u201cextreme conservatives\u201d who are \u201cright-to-life, pro-assault-weapon, anti-gay,\u201d have \u201cno place in the state of New York.\u201d\n\nAlabama Gov. Robert Bentley responded to Cuomo\u2019s comments, saying \u201cWe will protect the Freedoms of individuals and welcome any one or any company to Alabama.\u201d\n\nAlabama House Speaker Mike Hubbard also chimed in. \u201cIf (Gov. Cuomo) doesn\u2019t want hard working pro-life and pro-2nd Amendment people in his state, we will gladly take them here in Alabama,\u201d Hubbard said.\n\nAt least one conservative New Yorker has already indicated he will be leaving the state because of Cuomo\u2019s comments. New York native Sean Hannity said he\u2019s planning to leave The Empire State for good in favor of a lower-tax state, probably in the south.\n\n\u201cNow I want to tell you something \u2013 I was born and raised in New York,\u201d Hannity said. \u201cI want you to know that and I can\u2019t wait to get out of here. I really can\u2019t. I don\u2019t want to pay their 10-percent state tax anymore. I live in the second-highest property taxed county in the entire country in Nassau County. I can\u2019t wait to sell my house to somebody who wants it.\n\nNow personally, I welcome anyone to come down to Alabama \u2014 regardless of their political beliefs \u2014 to experience firsthand why this is the greatest state in the country.\n\nBut all of this got me thinking, what if we could just come to some sort of agreement with the State of New York? What if we could make some trades? We\u2019ll send some of our leftwing liberals up north in return for the handful of conservatives they have.\n\nAnd so, with that, I present to you The Great Alabama \u2014 New York Trade of 2014.\n\nAlabama\u2019s investment guru David Bronner has headed up the Retirement Systems of Alabama for over four decades. He grew RSA into one of the largest pension funds in the country. Unfortunately, the RSA has had a tough run of late, requiring a hefty investment from the taxpayers to prop it up. Bronner has found himself on the wrong side of conservatives in recent months by being one of the state\u2019s biggest advocates of expanding Medicaid under ObamaCare. A handful of Democrats have even publicly stated their desire for him to be their Party\u2019s nominee for governor, although Bronner\u2019s never expressed any interest in that himself.\n\nMeanwhile, Donald Trump\u2018s net worth has risen to an estimated $3.5 billion. As the Chairman and President of The Trump Organization, he oversees some of the country\u2019s largest real estate investments and a brand licensing juggernaut. His television show The Apprentice and its spinoffs have experienced a 13 season run as one of TV\u2019s biggest hits. Predictably, he\u2019s back in the news today stoking speculation that he may run for President in 2016 as a Republican.\n\nAn eccentric investor who publicly pushes for the expansion of the welfare state in exchange for another eccentric investor who champions the free market? Trade accepted.\n\nBirmingham\u2019s two most prominently featured liberal editorial writers, Joey Kennedy and John Archibald, have been delivering almost daily body blows to Alabama conservatives for a long time. Kennedy is the poster boy for the Birmingham News\u2019 struggles to adapt to the digital age. He\u2019s been noticeably absent from the public discourse lately, but he\u2019s spent years talking down to his audience and berating them for being racists and stuck in the past. Archibald\u2019s pessimism and disdain for the state he lives in is palpable in pretty much everything he writes.\n\nConservative talker Sean Hannity, who actually spent some time in Alabama in the past as a host on north Alabama talk staion WVNN, is a New York native who\u2019s ready to get out. His radio show went into national syndication in 2001, and has since become one of the most listened to radio broadcasts in the country. His nightly television show has been a staple on Fox News since 2007. He\u2019s also penned a couple of New York Times best-selling books.\n\nWe\u2019re quite certain Kennedy and Archibald would be better received in New York, and Hannity would fit in much better in our neck of the woods.\n\nWhile we\u2019re at it, let\u2019s just go ahead and trade the entire Birmingham News for The New York Post.\n\nThe Birmingham News is the largest newspaper in Alabama. In 2012, The News moved from a daily to a thrice-weekly paper as a result of declining revenue and circulation. It\u2019s currently trying to sell its $20 million office building and is hemorrhaging talent as it struggles to become a digital media company.\n\nThe News Corp-owned New York Post describes itself as the nation\u2019s oldest continuously published daily paper. It was started in 1801 by federalist Alexander Hamilton, but is now NYC\u2019s conservative alternative the The New York Times. It has the seventh largest circulation in the country.\n\nAlabamians seem to be doing just fine with the option to read Yellowhammer online, but if we\u2019ve got to have a print publication, it might as well be The Post instead of The News.\n\nDemocrat Roger Bedford has been in the Alabama State Senate since 1982. He\u2019s legendary for his crafty political maneuvering on the Senate floor and behind-the-scenes. But he\u2019s also one of the last remnants of a time in the Alabama legislature to which conservative Alabamians hope we never return.\n\nRudy Giuliani became known as \u201cAmerica\u2019s Mayor\u201d for his deft handling of New York City in the aftermath of 9/11. Prior to that, President Reagan appointed him to be U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York. During that time period, Guliani almost singlehandedly took down the Mafia in New York City, as well as other high profile white collar criminals and drug dealers. He ultimately ran an ill-fated presidential campaign in 2008 before returning to the private sector where he remains a partner in one of the top management and security consulting firms in the country.\n\nWe\u2019ll gladly send Bedford up north in return for America\u2019s Mayor.\n\nCullman, Ala. native Channing Tatum made it big in Hollywood after his breakout role in the 2006 dance movie Step Up. He has gone on to be in two G.I. Joe movies, Dear John (2010), The Vow (2012) and 21 Jump Street (2012), among other films. Oh, you didn\u2019t know he was from Alabama? Here\u2019s another little known fact about Tatum. He was in Ricky Martin\u2019s \u201cShe Bangs\u201d music video back in 2000.\n\nAs if that\u2019s not enough to send Tatum packing, he also had some choice words for potential conservative fans. \u201cIf they don\u2019t like me because I voted for Obama, then f\u2013k them,\u201d Tatum said in 2009. I like horses and I like Obama. Nothin\u2019 wrong with that.\u201d\n\nRobert Downey, Jr. is a Manhattan native who worked his way onto the Hollywood A-List, thanks in part to his roles as Iron Man and Sherlock Holmes. After a tough childhood \u201csurrounded by drugs,\u201d Downey was arrested in the mid-90s on multiple drug charges and ended up in a state prison in California. He now credits that experience with shaping his conservative political views.\n\n\u201cI have a really interesting political point of view, and it\u2019s not always something I say too loud at dinner tables here,\u201d Downey said. \u201cYou can\u2019t go from a $2,000-a-night suite at La Mirage to a penitentiary and really understand it and come out a liberal. You can\u2019t. I wouldn\u2019t wish that experience on anyone else, but it was very, very, very educational for me and has informed my proclivities and politics every since.\u201d\n\nDowney also recently took the stage with Sting and absolutely killed it.\n\nGiving up one of Hollywood\u2019s most obnoxious stars in return for a super hero? Yea, that\u2019ll work.\n\nMountain Brook, Ala. native Courteney Cox became one of the biggest television stars in history thanks to her role as Monica Geller on the hit NBC sitcom Friends. She\u2019s appeared in countless other movies and television shows, including Ace Ventura: Pet Detective, the Scream movies, and The Longest Yard on the big screen, as well as Seinfeld, Saturday Night Live and Scrubs on TV. She\u2019s such a big fan of Barack Obama that her and her then-husband David Arquette hosted an Obama victory party at their Beverly Hills home after he defeated Mitt Romney in 2012.\n\nJon Voight is Hollywood royalty. He sprang to stardom in the early 1970s after starring in Deliverance. He won the Academy Award for Best Actor in the 1978 film Coming Home about a paraplegic Vietnam vet. He was born in Yonkers, New York in 1938 and has been in too many films to even begin to list them all. He\u2019s also the father of Angelina Jolie. Not bad, Mr. Voight.\n\nAs for his political views, Voight\u2019s come a long way since appearing alongside Jane Fonda in support of leftists groups in the \u201970s. He has become a staunch conservative and a supporter of the Tea Party movement. Check out the letter he read to the American people on Mike Huckabee\u2019s television show in 2010.\n\nWe\u2019ll gladly give up a Hollywood liberal who\u2019s struggled to remain relevant in return for a Tea Party-loving, Academy Award winning actor with a body of work spanning a half century.\n\nRadric Davis, better known by his stage name Gucci Mane, was born in Birmingham, Ala. in 1980. His 2005 independent debut album, which included the song \u201cIcy,\u201d put him on the map, especially in the south. He\u2019s been involved in so many legal shenanigans between 2000 and 2013 that Wikipedia had to devote an entire multi-part, bullet-pointed section to them all. His song \u201cLemonade\u201d featured what some critiques called \u201cthe worst rap lyrics of all time.\u201d His 2010 mixtape was titled, \u201cBurrock Obama.\u201d\n\nJames Todd Smith, better known as LL Cool J is one of the best selling hip-hop artists of all-time and has had a career spanning three decades. He\u2019s also had an extensive acting career, including a starring role in Any Given Sunday and a recurring role on CBS\u2019 NCIS: Los Angeles.\n\nSmith is a self-identified independent, but he actively campaigned for New York Governor George Pataki, a fiscally conservative but socially liberal Republican. He also attended the 2004 Republican National Convention.\n\nTrading one of rap\u2019s worst lyricists for a pop culture icon who\u2019s campaigned for Republicans? Sure, we\u2019ll do that.\n\nFollow Cliff on Twitter @Cliff_Sims", "article_metadata": {"description": "In response to NY Gov.
