Apparently, that is debatable, even among Republicans.\n\nThe year \u201c2014 is going to be defined as a competency election, and which party does a better job of saying they can make the government function,\u201d said Brad Dayspring, a spokesman for the National Republican Senatorial Committee. \u201cRight now, the perception is that it\u2019s doing everything wrong\u201d under Mr. Obama.\n\nTo make that case, the Senate Republicans\u2019 campaign committee has for months circulated memos to supporters and reporters with what it says is the latest evidence from polls, pundits and policy controversies attesting to the incompetence of the president and, by extension, the Democratic Senate majority. \u201cThe increasingly long list of scandals, crisis and government incompetence (from Benghazi to the I.R.S., Obamacare to the debt, Bergdahl to negotiating with the Taliban, the V.A. to the situation in Iraq) have created an extremely toxic environment for Democrats,\u201d the committee said in a recent email.\n\nThere is little dispute that Mr. Obama is a significant drag on Democratic candidates given his low approval ratings, especially in Southern states where many competitive Senate races are unfolding. But even some Republicans say that Mr. Obama\u2019s competence is not this election\u2019s defining issue, or much of an issue at all except among conservatives who have never liked him.\n\n\u201cHis problem is that too many people aren\u2019t sure they like where he\u2019s led us, or that they want to go further for two more years,\u201d said Stuart Rothenberg, editor of the nonpartisan Rothenberg Political Report. \u201cThey think he\u2019s smart. They do think he\u2019s a little distant and a little detached. But is the problem that he\u2019s incompetent? I don\u2019t think that people think that.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAlex Castellanos, a Republican strategist, said that making competence a campaign centerpiece was \u201cthe fool\u2019s gold of politics\u201d \u2014 rarely successful.\n\n\u201cDo Republicans really want to make the argument that if only President Obama were a better manager, Obamacare would have been great for the country?\u201d he said. \u201cThat our outdated and bureaucratic V.A. system would have run like a clock? Do we really want to make the argument that our sclerotic, paralyzed, overburdened government just needs one guy to manage it better?\u201d\n\nAnother Republican strategist, who asked not to be identified criticizing party colleagues, said that raising the question of governing competence could be double-edged for Republicans. Indeed, many Democrats are reminding voters that the Republicans who run the House shut down the government last fall at a cost of $24 billion, according to the Congressional Budget Office, and have repeatedly been divided and dysfunctional, most recently in struggling to pass a bill to address the border crisis.\n\n\u201cTime and time again, House Republicans have shown they are completely incapable of governing,\u201d said Matt Canter, a spokesman for the Senate Democrats\u2019 campaign committee. \u201cNothing says incompetence like the Republican brand.\u201d\n\nMr. Canter made the connection to Senate contests in a widely distributed email as House Republicans fought over the border crisis. \u201cThe debacle in the House this week is why we\u2019re so excited the G.O.P. is running so many House Republicans for Senate,\u201d he wrote.\n\nOf House Republicans who are candidates in five Senate battlegrounds \u2014 Arkansas, Colorado, Louisiana, Montana and West Virginia \u2014 the two in Montana and West Virginia are considered all but certain to win seats currently held by Democrats, while the other three are in tight races.\n\nSenate Republican strategists like Mr. Dayspring cite several recent polls as evidence that the results will turn on doubts about Mr. Obama\u2019s competence, chiefly a late-June survey by Quinnipiac University in which 54 percent of registered voters said the president was not \u201ccompetent in running the government.\u201d In mid-July, 57 percent said \u201cno\u201d when asked in a CNN/ORC International poll if Mr. Obama \u201ccan manage the government effectively,\u201d and 53 percent said in a Pew Research Center poll that he is not \u201cable to get things done.\u201d\n\nYet Andrew Kohut, founder of the nonpartisan Pew Research Center, is among those who say such findings do not suggest that the midterm elections will be a referendum on Mr. Obama\u2019s competence. \u201cThe public is unhappy with the performance of both parties in Washington,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhat will shape the results? Mr. Kohut said that all elections were basically a referendum on the times and that, more than five years after the recession and 2008 financial collapse, \u201cwe\u2019ve got a chronic case of pessimism.\u201d That leaves Democrats at a disadvantage, he said, despite Republicans\u2019 record-low popularity, since \u201cDemocrats are seen as in charge because Obama is the president. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s more complicated than that.\u201d\n\nVoters\u2019 deep frustration with both sides explains why few election analysts, including people in both parties, predict a wave that would wipe out Democrats like in the 2010 midterms (or like 2006, when George W. Bush was president and Republicans lost their House and Senate majorities). Many Democrats argue that no single issue \u2014 certainly not Mr. Obama\u2019s competence \u2014 is defining Senate races. Instead, they say, the contests are defined by the relative strengths of each candidate and local issues.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about a lot of different elections here, and they\u2019re not all about one thing,\u201d said Mark Mellman, a Democratic pollster whose clients include Senate candidates. Typically, the president\u2019s party loses seats in midterm elections, he said, and to the extent that Mr. Obama is hurting Democrats among voters, \u201cthat does not necessarily mean their views of the president\u2019s competence is the reason.\u201d He added, \u201cWhat it means is that people are much more partisan today.\u201d\n\nJoel Benenson, a pollster for Mr. Obama, said: \u201cThe issue in this election is going to be the economic contrast between Democrats and Republicans. And it\u2019s a very strong contrast for Democrats, because Democrats have an agenda and a set of policies that demonstrate they are squarely fighting for working- and middle-class Americans.\u201d\n\nDavid Winston, a Republican pollster who advises House leaders, gave his party the edge, but he agreed that the midterm elections were \u201cgoing to come down to one basic issue: jobs and the economy, and who the voters have more confidence in, in terms of what\u2019s being proposed.\u201d\n\n\u201cCompetence plays into that: Can you get it done?\u201d he added. \u201cBut it\u2019s just a piece.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"ad-sponsor": "Elections, Senate", "tone": "news", "ptime": 20140813095228, "twitter": {"description": "There is disagreement among Republicans about whether they should focus efforts to win a Senate majority on the president\u2019s perceived incompetence.", "title": "While Some in G.O.P.
