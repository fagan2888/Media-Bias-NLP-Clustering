AFP, meanwhile, didn\u2019t give a specific casualty toll.\n\n\u201cThere are martyrs and wounded men among the ranks of the Lebanese army, and we have killed and injured several of the attackers,\u201d an army source told AFP.\n\nIt was not immediately clear which group the attackers belonged to, but Syria-based jihadist groups such as al-Qaeda\u2019s Syria branch, al-Nusra Front, and the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), which has captured large swathes of land in Iraq and Syria, have attacked Lebanon in recent months.\n\nHowever, Lebanon\u2019s state-run National News Agency (NNA) said the army regained control over Tallet Al-Hamra site in the vast area of Ras Baalbek mountain parallel to Ersal after fierce clashes with militants belonging to al-Nusra Front.\n\nAfter the harsh confrontations with \u201cheavy weapons,\u201d a number of \u201cdead and wounded among terrorists remained in the battle ground,\u201d the NNA reported.\n\nThe army said in a statement that the clashes were ongoing in the desolate area close to Ras Baalbek and that the army was shelling positions after the attack by a \u201cterrorist group.\u201d It did not give any details about casualties.\n\nMeanwhile, the NNA reported that military court Judge Saqr Saqr pressed charges on Friday against three people for belonging to an \u201carmed terrorist organization\u201d and planning attacks. These persons were also charged with partaking in fighting in Tripoli and attacking the Lebanese army.\n\nThe border clash is the latest violence between the Lebanese military and militants on the border with Syria.\n\nRas Baalbek is near the town of Ersal where Islamist militants staged a deadly incursion in August. The altercation left 16 soldiers dead and 85 wounded, while dozens of jihadists are said to have been killed, along with three civilians.\n\nFighting ended with a truce mediated by local clerics, but Nusra and ISIS militants took with them at least 29 Lebanese army and police hostages. Four hostages have since been executed, and eight have been released.\n\nThree months after the fighting in Ersal, Lebanese troops fought deadly clashes in October with the Islamist militants, in the northern city of Tripoli. The fighting left 42 people dead, including 11 soldiers and eight civilians.\n\nThe Nusra Front claimed responsibility for a twin suicide bombing that hit a popular caf\u00e9 in Tripoli\u2019s Jabal Mohsen neighborhood on January 10, claiming the lives of nine.\n\nThe Lebanese Army Forces (LAF) heightened security measures in the aftermath of the twin suicide bombing, the first breach to a security plan implemented in June last year following years of unrest between Jabal Mohsen and Bab al-Tabbaneh.\n\nAl-Akhbar English by Al-Akhbar English is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0 Unported License.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Around 200 gunmen launched a large-scale attack on an army outpost close to the village of Ras Baalbek, near Lebanon's eastern frontier with Syria, an area that has seen regular incursions from militants fighting in Syria's war.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "Al Akhbar", "og": {"site_name": "MintPress News", "description": "Around 200 gunmen launched a large-scale attack on an army outpost close to the village of Ras Baalbek, near Lebanon's eastern frontier with Syria, an area that has seen regular incursions from militants fighting in Syria's war.", "title": "Lebanon's Army Struggles To Contain Threat From Nusra Militants", "url": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/lebanons-army-struggles-contain-threat-nusra-militants/201509/", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/AP944952730050.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-01-23T09:55:59-05:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Around 200 gunmen launched a large-scale attack on an army outpost close to the village of Ras Baalbek, near Lebanon's eastern frontier with Syria, an area that has seen regular incursions from militants fighting in Syria's war.", "creator": "@MintPressNews", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/AP944952730050.jpg", "title": "Lebanon's Army Struggles To Contain Threat From Nusra Militants", "site": "@MintPressNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100003161352196}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MintpressNewsMPN", "section": "Daily Digest", "tag": "Ras Baalbek", "published_time": "2015-01-24T05:00:47-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-23T09:55:59-05:00"}}, "article_summary": "Lebanon\u2019s Army Struggles To Contain Threat From Nusra MilitantsAround 200 gunmen launched a large-scale attack on an army outpost close to the village of Ras Baalbek, near Lebanon's eastern frontier with Syria, an area that has seen regular incursions from militants fighting in Syria's war.\nFighting ended with a truce mediated by local clerics, but Nusra and ISIS militants took with them at least 29 Lebanese army and police hostages.\nRas Baalbek is near the town of Ersal where Islamist militants staged a deadly incursion in August.\nPhoto: Hussein Malla/APHeavy clashes erupted between the Lebanese army and militants near the northern Bekaa Valley border town of Ras Baalbek, a Lebanese security source said, leaving casualties on both sides.\n\u201cThere are martyrs and wounded men among the ranks of the Lebanese army, and we have killed and injured several of the attackers,\u201d an army source told AFP."}
