Police have seized 26 pounds of marijuana from two alleged drug traffickers in Tuscaloosa.

Authorities arrested two men during a stop Friday on Interstate 20.

Officials said the marijuana was valued at roughly $78,000. Police said the suspects also had multiple Viagra pills inside the 2013 Chevrolet Silverado.

One suspect, 69-year-old Edwin Vawters of Ypsilanti, Michigan, was charged with one count of trafficking marijuana. He was being held in the Tuscaloosa County Jail on a $1 million bond.

A second suspect, 29-year-old Charles Kentrell Williams of Moundville, Alabama, was charged with trafficking marijuana. He was being held on a $500,000 bond. It was unclear Saturday whether the men had defense attorneys.
