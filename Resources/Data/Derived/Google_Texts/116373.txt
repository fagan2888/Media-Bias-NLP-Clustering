Big-cap Paychex has three favorable factors going for it.

First, Paychex (PAYX) stock is forming a base-on-base pattern. The consolidation is a flat pattern built on top of a cup with handle. It offers a potential buy point at 48.30.

The stock broke past a 44.78 entry in the cup with handle in October, but volume was weak. Paychex rose about 7% and then began the next consolidation.

Individual investors should watch to see if the stock can break out in strong volume. Without strong volume, indicating institutional buying, there’s nothing to drive the stock price higher.

Second, Paychex belongs to a strong industry group. Commercial Services-Outsourcing was No. 10 among 197 industry groups in Wednesday’s IBD. Research shows that a strong group helps a stock advance.

Third, Paychex has expanded its outsourcing services, pushing into new areas. They include: a cloud-based time and attendance service that Paychex tacked on via its June acquisition of Nettime Solutions; Paychex Time, a mobile time-punch application; and a health care product that helps clients comply with the complexities of ObamaCare.

Last week, Paychex reported results for fiscal Q2, which ended in November. Earnings rose 9%, up from 7% and 5% gains in the previous two quarters. Revenue grew 10%, the best in at least 19 quarters. Both earnings and sales topped the Street’s estimates.

After-tax margin was 25.6%, near the high end of the usual range of 22.4% to 26.6%.

At the earnings call Dec. 19, CEO Martin Mucci said that Paychex’s client retention level was 82%, an all-time high.

Paychex has a three- and five-year Earnings Stability Factor of 1, on a scale that runs from 0 (calm) to 99 (wild).

The firm pays a quarterly dividend of 38 cents a share, which yields 3.2% on an annualized basis. The quarterly payout has tripled since 2005.
