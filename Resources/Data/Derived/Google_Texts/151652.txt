Kansas Attorney General Derek Schmidt has been eagerly sought by reporters this week for comments on major court cases in which he came out on the losing end. But those requests generally went unanswered, until late Friday afternoon.

“We are reviewing the past two days’ opinions internally and with our various clients to assess next steps," Schmidt said. "Fortunately, tomorrow (Saturday) starts a weekend, and the courts should be done at least for this week with issuing decisions.”

As the state's attorney general, Schmidt is responsible for defending the state and its laws whenever they are challenged in court. In recent months, that has included:

• Defending the state's ban on same-sex marriage against a lawsuit by the American Civil Liberties union.

• Defending the state's new ban on an abortion procedure known as "dilation and evacuation," or D&E, which anti-abortion activists now call "dismemberment abortion," in the face of a lawsuit by an abortion rights group.

• And defending the state's school finance system, including a major overhaul made just a few months ago, against a lawsuit filed by several school districts.

Along the way, Schmidt also has intervened as a "friend of the court" in federal cases challenging portions of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, although his two-sentence response Friday wasn't specifically aimed at the health care decision.

On Thursday, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the key provision of Obamacare that Schmidt's office had challenged. And that same day, a Shawnee County district judge issued an injunction against enforcing the state's new abortion ban.

Then on Friday, the U.S. Supreme Court dealt another blow, declaring state bans on same-sex marriage unconstitutional and giving gay couples the right to marry in all 50 states.

And finally Friday, a three-judge panel flatly declared the state's school funding mechanism a violation of the Kansas Constitution.
