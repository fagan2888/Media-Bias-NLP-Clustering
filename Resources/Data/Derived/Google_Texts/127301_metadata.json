Michelle Obama not only wants to control your menu; she also wants to control the topic of your family dinner conversation by exhorting your more impressionable relatives to sell you on her husband\u2019s substandard ObamaCare junk plans.\n\nThe \u201cHealth Care for the Holidays\u201d page on BarackObama.com, promoted by his wife, urges his remaining devoted followers to \u201cpledge\u201d to push ObamaCare on family members and advises \u201cintegrating the talk into family time.\u201d\n\nBecause there\u2019s nothing that says \u201cfamily time\u201d like teaching people to hijack family dinners to become used health care salesmen; BarackObama.com offers sales tips like \u201cMake it memorable,\u201d \u201cBe Persistent, but keep it positive\u201d and \u201cFind a quiet place.\u201d That last tip will prevent other family members from hearing their screams of horror at the size of their new ObamaCare premiums and deductibles.\n\nThese aren\u2019t tips for talking to family members; but for scamming them out of money. They\u2019re the sort of crude sales techniques that MLM affiliates get in the mail. Be positive, be persistent and eventually you\u2019ll sucker some poor idiot into an ObamaCare plan with a bigger deductible than the national debt.\n\nAnd if the poor idiot is related to you\u2026 that just makes him an easier mark.\n\nDoing its best to make ObamaCare seem like a creepy cult, Obama supporters are instructed to badger family members with cries of \u201cHave you thought about signing up,\u201d \u201cWould you like to sign up now,\u201d \u201cWhen do you plan on signing up\u201d and \u201cHave you signed up yet.\u201d\n\nThe only thing missing is; \u201cIf you don\u2019t sign up for ObamaCare; I won\u2019t love you anymore.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s not just Organizing for America, the rebirth of Obama\u2019s 2012 campaign as a mutated Super PAC, that is working on ruining your Thanksgiving. MSNBC, the Los Angeles Times, the Huffington Post and the Washington Post have also gotten into the Thanksgiving Knockout Game.\n\nThe Washington Post offers a guide for convincing all your relatives that ObamaCare is working great because 12,000 people have signed up in Washington.\n\nThere\u2019s tips for convincing your mom and dad that ObamaCare isn\u2019t a disaster, persuading your grandfather that ObamaCare doesn\u2019t have death panels, assuring your brother that he won\u2019t lose his employer health plan, brushing off your uncle\u2019s complaint about his health plan cancellation and convincing your cousin\u2019s girlfriend who has a degree in Computer Science that she doesn\u2019t know anything about what\u2019s wrong with Healthcare.gov and should just shut up.\n\nNot only will the Washington Post preemptively map out your family arguments for you; but the answer to each of them is that Obama is always right.\n\nEven Pravda couldn\u2019t have done any better.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times offers the only honestly dishonest liberal debating guide with debate tips like \u201cFlatter your opponent,\u201d \u201cArgue by anecdote\u201d and \u201cCall out the other person for arguing by anecdote.\u201d\n\nAnd if any family members get sick of your Los Angeles Times approved plan to hijack Thanksgiving by coming to a prepared debate with an assistant to look up things for you on a smartphone while you anecdotally compare Republicans to Hitler; the Los Angeles Times also offers tips for handling \u201cannoying peacekeepers\u201d who say things like \u201cWhy don\u2019t we just try to have a nice time on Thanksgiving?\u201d\n\nThe nerve of these people trying to have a family dinner on Thanksgiving instead of a screaming match about ObamaCare; don\u2019t they know that their attitude is ruining your progressive Thanksgiving?\n\nBut what if you\u2019re a fanatical progressive who doesn\u2019t think that berating family members about ObamaCare over Thanksgiving dinner is in the spirit of the holiday? There are other liberal causes that you can scream at them about.\n\nMichael Bloomberg\u2019s Mayors Against Illegal Guns has a Thanksgiving turkey placemat to print out and shove at family members so that they too can \u201cdemand a plan.\u201d\n\nThe Bloomberg Turkey (not legal in New York due to its size and transfat content) is less about selling your family members on trashing the Second Amendment and more about celebrating Bloomberg\u2019s pet taxpayer-funded lobby with quizzes that ask how many races the \u201cWashington Gun Lobby\u201d has won and whether they live in a state that requires background checks for firearms purchases.\n\nLeave it to Mayor Bloomberg to find a way to make the ObamaCare Thanksgiving sales pitch look like fun.\n\nBut what if talking about shooting people just doesn\u2019t feel like appropriate Thanksgiving dinner conversation? There\u2019s always killing babies.\n\nPlanned Parenthood has been giving out tips for promoting abortion at Thanksgiving for years. The handout urges Planners to avoid discussing \u201cwhen life begins\u201d and focus instead on shared values like everyone having the right to decide \u201cwhether to become a parent\u201d or to carry a dead baby in a handbag to a Victoria\u2019s Secret store.\n\nPlanned Parenthood urges framing abortion as a personal issue instead of a political issue. But whether it\u2019s personal or political; the baby is still dead and Thanksgiving dinner is still ruined.\n\nBut what if you don\u2019t want to limit yourself to just one way of ruining Thanksgiving?\n\nThe Democratic National Committee has gotten into the fun with YourRepublicanUncle; a site that promises to do for Thanksgiving what the Democratic Party already did for America.\n\nThere are tips for debating family members on every liberal cause. Don\u2019t just settle for screaming at your uncles about abortion, ObamaCare or ObamaCare\u2019s abortions.\n\nThe Democratic National Committee also wants you to scream at family members about the economy, immigration and global warming with crazy lies claiming that Obama\u2019s increase of the National Debt from 10 trillion to 17 trillion is actually a dramatic decrease, that ObamaCare saves businesses money and that illegal alien amnesty isn\u2019t amnesty.\n\nDespite all the energy being poured into turning Julia into the best community organizer that she can be; none of these debate preps are really about winning arguments. The debate prep comes packaged with heavy doses of contempt for \u201colder\u201d conservative relatives. The real theme isn\u2019t winning arguments, but maintaining the mental bubble in which Obama supporters live when they go outside their natural urban liberal environment.\n\nObamaCare\u2019s target population is the young. The debate prep is really about convincing them not to question ObamaCare by injecting a bunch of talking points directly into their brains and reinforcing their contempt for everyone who disagrees as a bunch of ignorant racist old people who don\u2019t know nearly as much about health care as the guy who didn\u2019t know that his entire health care plan was a turkey.\n\n*\n\nDon't miss Jamie Glazov's video interview with Daniel Greenfield about Obama's Destructive Agenda, his Muslim Brotherhood Romance, the Anthony Weiner-Huma Abedin saga, and much, much more:\n\nFreedom Center pamphlets now available on Kindle: Click here.", "article_metadata": {"rating": "general", "description": "The leftist hijacking of Thanksgiving.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Frontpage Mag", "description": "The leftist hijacking of Thanksgiving.", "title": "The Obama Who Stole Thanksgiving", "url": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/fpm/211865/obama-who-stole-thanksgiving-daniel-greenfield", "updated_time": "2015-06-22T23:38:23-04:00", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/fpm/211865/obama-who-stole-thanksgiving-daniel-greenfield", "description": "The leftist hijacking of Thanksgiving.", "card": "summary", "title": "The Obama Who Stole Thanksgiving"}, "article": {"published_time": "2013-11-27T19:51:43-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-22T23:38:23-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Leave it to Mayor Bloomberg to find a way to make the ObamaCare Thanksgiving sales pitch look like fun.\nBut whether it\u2019s personal or political; the baby is still dead and Thanksgiving dinner is still ruined.\nBut what if talking about shooting people just doesn\u2019t feel like appropriate Thanksgiving dinner conversation?\nNot content that the price of a whole frozen turkey went up 37% under his economic policies, Obama decided to completely ruin Thanksgiving dinner by turning it into an angry debate about ObamaCare.\nBut what if you\u2019re a fanatical progressive who doesn\u2019t think that berating family members about ObamaCare over Thanksgiving dinner is in the spirit of the holiday?"}
