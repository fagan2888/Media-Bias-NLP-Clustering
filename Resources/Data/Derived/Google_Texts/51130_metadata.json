Bernie Sanders of Vermont \u2014 the self-described democratic socialist who is running for the Democratic Party nomination \u2014 is elected president.\n\nAs quoted in the Huffington Post, O\u2019Reilly said:\n\n\u201cIf Bernie Sanders gets elected president, I\u2019m fleeing \u2026 I\u2019m going to Ireland. And they already know it. \u2026 I shouldn\u2019t say it publicly because that will get Sanders more votes,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019m not going to pay 90 percent of my income to that guy. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m not doing it.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Reilly is proud of his Irish ancestry (as a recent emigrant from Ireland and current U.S. citizen, I heartily approve of these sentiments). But he probably doesn\u2019t know very much about what Ireland is like these days. From the perspective of its Western European neighbors, Ireland is a small, market-friendly, right-of-center country. But from the perspective of American conservatism, Ireland looks like a hellhole of socialism.\n\nCan O\u2019Reilly easily flee to Ireland?\n\nIt may be tougher than he thinks. It would seem that O\u2019Reilly\u2019s nearest Irish ancestor was his great-grandfather. This means that he misses the cutoff for automatic Irish citizenship by one generation. If you have one Irish grandparent, you qualify for Irish citizenship \u2014 but unless O\u2019Reilly\u2019s grandparent or parent formally applied, he\u2019s out of luck. He does have a second possibility though \u2014 paying to become a citizen. Ireland, like many other countries, provides citizenship to individuals who are willing to invest or donate a large sum of money to the benefit of the Irish economy.\n\nIreland is not a conservative paradise: Look at the taxes\n\nWhat would O\u2019Reilly get in return for his money? First off, a tax system that is not all that different from the U.S. tax system for top earners, and arguably a little less favorable. The effective top Irish income tax rate is a little over half of income.\n\nIn the rather unlikely event that Sanders was elected president in a landslide of socialist enthusiasm, turning the Senate and the House socialist, and introducing punitive taxes to impoverish rich Fox News opinionators, O\u2019Reilly would still be in trouble. Even if he lived in Ireland, he would have difficulty avoiding U.S. taxes unless he renounced his U.S. citizenship. The United States continues to regard U.S. expatriates as taxpayers, no matter where they reside. Ireland and the United States have a double taxation treaty, to prevent people being taxed twice for the same income \u2014 this might provide some loopholes for royalties and the like, but probably not enough to make an enormous difference. O\u2019Reilly would likely find himself paying to support Sanders\u2019s socialist American utopia from overseas.\n\nIreland has serious gun control\n\nBill O\u2019Reilly has strong views on his right to own guns to defend himself under the Second Amendment.\n\n\u201cI have a right to protect myself, because there are crazed animals like the guy in Oregon. \u2026 There are people like that who will come after innocent people for no reason. And you are going to deny me protection? If I live out in a rural Oregon \u2026 where the nearest cop is 40 miles away? I can\u2019t have a gun to protect my family?\u201d\n\nThe Irish attitude to guns is going to be a serious culture shock. First, he\u2019ll be far worse off than he would be in rural Oregon. While there will surely be cops closer than 40 miles away, those cops will almost certainly be unarmed. In Ireland, police only carry arms under special circumstances. Most Irish police officers don\u2019t even have firearms training.\n\nFurthermore, gun ownership is highly restricted in Ireland. People have to apply for a license to own a gun, and are likely to be refused under many circumstances. Furthermore, there are heavy restrictions on kinds of guns that they are allowed to own \u2014 roughly speaking, guns for sport and hunting (sports pistols; shotguns; some kinds of rifles) are okay, but handguns of the kind that O\u2019Reilly could use for \u201cself-defense\u201d are not, let alone automatic weapons. Gun rights are not a topic of political debate in Ireland \u2014 Ireland\u2019s most conservative party, which is now the majority party in the government, has just introduced new restrictions, without any significant public opposition.\n\nIreland has socialized medicine\n\nO\u2019Reilly denounces Obamacare as \u201csocialism\u201d because it uses taxpayers\u2019 money to subsidize the poor. The Irish health-care system does the same thing, on a much larger scale, with a hospital system that is directly run by the government. In Ireland, hospital doctors are government employees (although many senior doctors earn substantial incomes on the side from private practice). Everyone in Ireland is entitled to free basic health care in hospitals, and low income people get medical cards entitling them to free doctors\u2019 visits and many other services.\n\nThis system is far from perfect, which means that many middle-class and upper-middle-class people supplement it with private health insurance (so that, for example, they do not have to wait long times for some surgical procedures). Even so, it\u2019s socialized medicine on a scale which would be politically unthinkable in America. Ireland also has welfare benefits for the unemployed that are not notably generous by European standards, but are wildly permissive in comparison to their U.S. equivalents.\n\nJust hours before the third Democratic presidential primary debate, candidate Bernie Sanders released details about his proposed single-payer health-care plan.\n\nThere are other ways in which Ireland is more congenial to conservatives like O\u2019Reilly. Most obviously, abortion is far more heavily curtailed in Ireland than the United States (although the conservative party leading government has promised to liberalize Ireland\u2019s abortion laws this year).\n\nEven though Ireland is a conservative country by West European standards, it\u2019s far, far to the left of U.S. conservative preferences on many key issues.\n\nIf O\u2019Reilly really thinks that Ireland is a good alternative to a Sanders-led America, it\u2019s probably because he\u2019s unfamiliar with what Ireland is really like as a country. If a putative Sanders administration were somehow able successfully to introduce Irish-style health care, an Irish-style welfare state and Irish-style gun control, it would be viewed by conservatives as a socialist revolution.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Bill O'Reilly will flee to Ireland if Sanders is elected.
