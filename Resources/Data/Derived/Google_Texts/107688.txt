ZURICH (AP) — A sign of the FIFA president’s newly-diminished powers and status will come when Gianni Infantino’s salary is revealed.

A person with knowledge of the situation says Infantino’s No. 2 — a chief executive in an overhauled FIFA structure — will now receive a bigger pay packet than the president.

With the presidency moving toward a non-executive figurehead position, Infantino’s salary will be less than predecessor Sepp Blatter’s pay.

The person spoke on condition of anonymity because FIFA salaries are not currently allowed to be discussed publicly.

FIFA is due to reveal salaries for the first time next month as part of reforms approved Friday before Infantino’s victory.

With the president’s powers curbed, day-to-day executive control transfers to the administration headed by the CEO, which replaces the existing secretary general position.
