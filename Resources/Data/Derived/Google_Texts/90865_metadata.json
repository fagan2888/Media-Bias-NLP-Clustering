Call it supply-side. Call it entrepreneurship. Call it take-home pay.\n\n\n\nBut the endgame is growth and prosperity.\n\n\n\nSo let\u2019s make this very simple. Like almost every election in American history, 2016 is going to be about growth versus redistribution, private-sector markets and competition versus government planning, and a hard reliable dollar versus a protectionist collapse of the greenback.\n\n\n\nBack in 2012, the GOP never made the optimistic growth case. As fine a man as he is, Mitt Romney played the pessimist, telling us daily what\u2019s wrong with America and its economy. And Barack Obama was the optimist, telling us that things weren\u2019t great but they were improving.\n\n\n\nVoters chose the optimist. They always do.\n\n\n\nBill Clinton. Ronald Reagan. John F. Kennedy. FDR.\n\n\n\nYet as small as the economic segment was in the Cleveland debate, I think three people came out on top of it: John Kasich, Marco Rubio, and Jeb Bush.\n\n\n\nAnd one individual went wrong direction: Donald Trump.\n\n\n\nKasich offered few specifics. But he absolutely launched on effective riffs for growth and optimism.\n\n\n\n\u201cEconomic growth is the key,\u201d said Kasich. \u201cEconomic growth is the key to everything. And we must reach out to people in the shadows. America is a miracle country, and we have to restore the sense that the miracle will apply to you.\u201d\n\n\n\nKasich argued for \u201cgrowth, growth, growth,\u201d with lower tax rates and a balanced budget. He basically adopted the JFK-Reagan-Jack Kemp mantra that a rising tide lifts all boats.\n\n\n\nJeb Bush was more programmatic. He stuck to his 4 percent growth target and emphasized that 2 percent secular stagnation is not acceptable. He wants lower tax rates, fewer regulations, unleashed energy, school choice, and Obamacare repeal. And he asserted at least twice that effective immigration reform is an economic-growth driver.\n\n\n\nMarco Rubio also argued for Obamacare repeal and school choice, and mentioned limited regulatory budgeting and overturning Dodd-Frank. Interestingly, he was specific on taxes. He argued for a 25 percent corporate tax rate for small and big businesses.\n\n\n\nThis looks like a positive change. Previously he had a 35 percent top personal tax rate, which would be the small-business pass-through rate. If he\u2019s lowering that to 25 percent, a good thing, it may mean he\u2019s cutting way back on his $1.6 trillion child-tax-credit proposal, which has been panned by supply-siders as anathema to true tax reform without any growth impact. We\u2019ll see if that reading is correct.\n\n\n\nGovernor Chris Christie also wants to lower tax rates, but his Social Security plan would reduce benefits and turn the system into a means-tested entitlement. Respectfully, I don\u2019t buy it. Anyway, if the economy grew at 3.5 percent over the long run \u2014 the American tradition \u2014 Social Security would be in fine shape.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Ben Carson seemed to promote a 10 percent flat tax, but offered no details, and Mike Huckabee stuck with his fair tax, which is well intentioned but unworkable. Rand Paul\u2019s promising flat tax never came up.\n\n\n\nAnd no one talked about the dollar and monetary policy, which are incredibly important. A collapsing dollar value such as occurred in the 1970s and 2000s will doom the economy.\n\n\n\nBut a reliably hard dollar not only keeps inflation low, it gives America a leg up in the global race for capital.\n\n\n\nAnd then there\u2019s Donald Trump.\n\n\n\nAs I wrote a week ago, his 2011 book highlighted supply-side policies such as slashing personal tax rates and abolishing the corporate tax. There was no mention of these in the debate.\n\n\n\nInstead, Trump continued to rail against China and Mexico and generally the rest of the world.\n\n\n\nThis has protectionism written all over it. Mexico is our second-leading export market. China is our second-biggest trading partner. A 35 percent tariff, which Trump has hinted at in the past, would be a gigantic tax hike, setting off a global trade war and doing incalculable damage to our economy.\n\n\n\nWe don\u2019t need another Smoot-Hawley. Trump should have been asked about this by the debate moderators.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, the subject of trade never came up.\n\n\n\nEconomic growth and optimism are the keys to victory.\n\n\n\nBut until Republicans spell out specifics on taxes, trade, and money, they won\u2019t close the deal.\n\n\n\nTo find out more about Lawrence Kudlow and read features by other Creators Syndicate writers and cartoonists, visit the Creators Syndicate web page at www.creators.com\n\n\n\n\u00a9 Creators Syndicate Inc.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "republicans, gop debate, trump, taxes", "pubdate": "2015-08-07T19:54:01", "og": {"site_name": "Newsmax", "description": "Economic growth and optimism are the keys to victory.
