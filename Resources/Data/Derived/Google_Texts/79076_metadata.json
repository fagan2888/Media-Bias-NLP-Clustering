Sunday: Big donors in control Monday: Attack ads sicken Ohioans Tuesday: Collecting information on you Wednesday: Secretive organizations Thursday: Attacks, early and often\n\nIn the 2012 election, Ohio radio and television stations couldn\u2019t sign contracts for political advertising fast enough as a seismic shift occurred in American politics, playing out on TV screens and car radios across the Buckeye State.\n\nIndependent political groups with confusing-sounding labels like super PACs, 501(C)(4)s, and 527 organizations singled out Ohio to divide tens of millions of dollars among dozens of broadcasters to lock up air time.\n\nTheir goal: Sway, if not manipulate the famous swing-state voters.\n\nThose groups \u2014 funded by rich business people and corporations outside Ohio and working separately from the candidates and political parties \u2014 spent at least $28 million here on the presidential election, $38.9 million in the U.S. Senate race, and $18 million on Ohio\u2019s 16 congressional races.\n\nIn the hotly contested Senate race alone, Republican strategist Karl Rove\u2019s Crossroads GPS aired broadside after broadside against Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown, spending more than $6 million, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.\n\nIn fact, outside interests spent more to support Brown\u2019s opponent, Republican Josh Mandel, than did Mandel\u2019s own campaign.\n\nAltogether, that means that outside groups, mostly conservative, spent at least $85 million to sway Ohio voters in the 2012 U.S. races.\n\nOhioans know something has changed. They have a keen sense that there are more ads and meaner messages. What many don\u2019t know is that in the last six years, corporations and billionaire business magnates have stripped traditional campaigns and political parties of their power.\n\nThe rich are keeping their money and controlling the message through their own organizations. With little accountability and little transparency, they deliver messages that shock and dismay the Midwestern psyche.\n\nOhioans disgusted\n\nPresumably, political consultants spend heavily on dramatic negative TV ads because they do what they\u2019re supposed to: influence voters.\n\nAsked for three words to express their feelings about the ads, Ohioans exude disgust.\n\nAlex Nestor, 21, a student at Ohio University\u2019s Lancaster campus, referred to the ads as \u201cintrusive, ineffective, obnoxious.\u201d\n\nRosalyn Webber, 48, of Mansfield, called them \u201cpathetic, tired, tacky. \u2026 [Rich donors] think Ohioans are stupid, plain and simple. They think that people in Ohio don\u2019t have the sense that God gave geese.\u201d\n\n\u201cBunch of lies,\u201d said Ron Baker, 76, of Galion.\n\n\u201cI really don\u2019t respect most of the advertising that\u2019s available,\u201d said Jeff Nelson, 64, of Toledo, a field engineer in electronics. \u201cMost of it\u2019s stuff that isn\u2019t totally true. It\u2019s easy to take a sentence or part of a sentence out of context, or to say \u2018He voted for that,\u2019 when in fact it was a procedural vote.\u201d\n\nHe said he\u2019s likely to grab the remote and switch channels, and rely on his own research on candidates.\n\nKristina Keeler, 56, of Perrysburg, a pre-school teacher, said TV ads are \u201cunhelpful.\u201d\n\n\u201cI despise the amount of money we spend on all of our campaigns. What a waste of money. Put that money to better use,\u201d Keeler said. She acknowledged that the ads probably work with her, to some extent.\n\n\u201cI have a reaction to an ad on TV, whether it\u2019s patriotic and feel-good or gloom and doom, you can\u2019t help it,\u201d she said.\n\nA Pew Research Center poll showed that nearly three-quarters of Americans say money and influence from outside interests is the \u201cbiggest problem with elected officials in Washington.\u201d And there is strong public support across party lines to cap contribution limits from individuals, including billionaires and corporations.\n\nThe pivotal moment\n\nThe January 2010 U.S. Supreme Court decision in Citizens United vs. Federal Election Commission gave First Amendment protection to wealthy individuals, corporations, and unions to raise and spend unlimited amounts of money \u2014 provided they didn\u2019t directly coordinate with the candidates they were supporting.\n\nSome of the spending is required to be reported to the FEC, and some of it is reported voluntarily. The Campaign Finance Institute, using Federal Elections Commission numbers, estimates that in the 10 months following the Citizens United ruling, outside spending on positive ads to support Congressional candidates doubled, but more importantly, spending on attack ads increased nearly eight-fold.\n\nWithout transparency, and without culpability for the candidates, there was little incentive to play nice.\n\nAccording to the nonprofit, nonpartisan group Center for Responsive Politics, through its Website www.opensecrets.org, total outside spending nationwide in the 2012 presidential race leaned heavily Republican.\n\nIndependent spending nationwide was $424.4 million supporting Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney and $145 million supporting Democratic President Barack Obama.\n\nHowever, the sources of the money often is a mystery, which is why it\u2019s sometimes known as \u201cdark money.\u201d\n\nA good example of how independent expenditures influence elections while leaving a minimal impact on the public record is that of Americans for Prosperity, the 501(c) organization funded by the billionaire industrialists Charles and David Koch.\n\nLook up its 2012 expenditures in opensecrets.org and the only line that comes up is: $33,542,051 spent against President Obama\u2019s re-election.\n\nAFP isn\u2019t much more forthcoming about its donors, either, which don\u2019t have to be disclosed to the FEC. Through cross-referencing with nonprofit organizations\u2019 tax returns, the Center for Responsive Politics has identified 66 donors, all of them other organizations. The biggest contributor, with $65 million donated since 2010, is Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce, which accounts for about two-thirds of AFP\u2019s total donations of $96.9 million. Freedom Partners is controlled by the Koch brothers.\n\nNo bread crumbs\n\nHow much of that was spent in Ohio is not reported to the Federal Election Commission, and thus difficult to gauge.\n\nFederal law requires broadcasters to provide public access to all their political advertising contracts, and so the campaigns\u2019 media consultants collect the information through constant contact with the television and radio stations in all of the nation\u2019s media markets. Those records only must be kept two years.\n\nSince 2014, broadcasters have been required to post the information on the Internet, improving the ability of the public and the news media to find out who\u2019s spending how much.\n\nIt\u2019s still a data-gathering nightmare.\n\nTwo large organizations contacted by The Blade refused to divulge information about the 2012 presidential election campaign.\n\nThe Washington Post in 2012 hired a media firm to collect data and reported that the total spending in Ohio on the 2012 election \u2014 including candidates and outside groups \u2014 was $78 million in favor of Romney and $72 million in favor of Obama, for a total of $150 million.\n\nThat made Ohio the third most expensive battleground state, after Florida, with $173 million, and Virginia, with $151 million. (Here\u2019s the Post\u2019s report: http://j.mp/1NurycS.)\n\nSeparating the outside spending is harder. National Public Radio reported that independent political groups spent $28.3 million between April 10 and Oct. 10 in Ohio. It\u2019s reasonable to assume that half-again as much was spent in the final month before the 2012 election. (Here\u2019s NPR\u2019s report: http://j.mp/1NurzxD.)\n\nGiven that President Obama was re-elected with a comfortable margin in Ohio, one could ask whether the barrage of anti-Democratic advertising was worth it.\n\nReportedly, the Koch brothers have taken stock of their political spending after its lack of success in 2012 and 2014.\n\nThe publication Politico.com reported that the brothers have taken their spending \u201cdeeper\u201d \u2014 away from TV ads and into staff, training, data analysis, and building a voter database. Furthermore, they remained neutral in the Republican presidential nomination contest and have not yet endorsed the presumptive nominee, fellow billionaire Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cThere were memos that were done in that cycle on money that was spent unsuccessfully and there was a little bit of a shakeup in thinking about that,\u201d said Mary Bottari, spokesman for a Center for Media and Democracy, a nonprofit group in Madison, Wisc., that advocates for tighter election financing laws.\n\n\u201cWe need disclosure in campaigns and elections and we need limits on spending in campaigns and elections and we need to level the playing field for average citizens to run for office,\u201d she said. \u201cAverage citizens aren\u2019t going to be able to raise $20 million to run for office.\u201d\n\nThe Mandel machine\n\nSomewhat more information is available about the 2012 campaign for the U.S. Senate between incumbent Senator Brown and challenger Mandel, the state treasurer.\n\nThe barrage of conservative negative advertising alarmed the Brown campaign, which complained loudly about the invasion of \u201cdark money\u201d into Ohio\u2019s election campaign.\n\nRove\u2019s Crossroads GPS created one ad targeting Brown\u2019s support for the trillion-dollar stimulus bill aimed at softening the impact of the 2007-2009 recession.\n\n\u201cYou voted for skyrocketing debt, the failed stimulus and Obamacare,\u201d the narrator intoned. \u201cYou voted for reckless spending, and how\u2019d you pay for it? Billions in new taxes and trillions in crushing debt. Sorry, Senator Brown. No more reckless spending, no new taxes, and no more blank checks.\u201d\n\nJustin Barasky, who was communications director for Senator Brown in 2012 and is now communications director for a pro-Hillary Clinton super PAC, Priorities USA, said the outside spending in Ohio was the most of any U.S. Senate race in the country in 2012.\n\nHe estimates the outside spending at $31 million against Senator Brown versus $12.5 million favorable to Senator Brown.\n\nHis estimate is about $4.6 million higher than the Center for Responsive Politics\u2019 estimate of $38.9 million, and he contends it is more accurate.\n\n\u201cWe had a media firm and they had someone whose job it was to track the buys,\u201d Barasky said.\n\n\u201cYes [Senator Brown] won, but imagine how much more he would have won by if they hadn\u2019t spent $31 million on TV? No question it makes a difference. [Mandel] is a fantastic fund-raiser, but he was a pretty bad candidate otherwise, and yet the race was very competitive, and it shouldn\u2019t have been,\u201d Barasky said.\n\nSeth Unger, a political spokesman for Mandel, had a different take on the 2012 Senate race. He pointed out that, with Senator Brown\u2019s bigger campaign warchest taken into account, total spending on the race was pretty close: $42.4 million for Mandel and $39.8 million for Brown. He disputed Barasky\u2019s claims that the outside spending was higher than Center for Responsive Politics\u2019 accounting.\n\nUnger said the 2012 Senate race was the closest in 36 years in Ohio, and that Mandel outperformed his Republican compatriots in Virginia, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Florida, Michigan, and West Virginia. No incumbent Democratic U.S. senator was defeated in 2012.\n\n\u201cTreasurer Mandel respects the Supreme Court decision in Citizens United and believes strongly in free speech,\u201d Unger said.\n\nA repeat contest could be on tap for 2018. Mandel in January filed papers with the FEC to run the U.S. Senate. Brown is up for re-election in 2018.\n\nWhile Freedom Partners does everything it can to avoid disclosing its donors, the organization makes an effort to notify the news media and thereby the public of its TV ad campaigns.\n\n\u201cFreedom Partners Chamber of Commerce is a free-market chamber of commerce with hundreds of members \u2014 businessmen/women and philanthropists, including Charles and David Koch,\u201d said Freedom Partners spokesman Bill Riggs.\n\nIn January, Charles Koch held a meeting with 500 supporters at his estate in Indian Wells, Calif., and invited journalists from USA Today, Buzzfeed News, Bloomberg, NBC News, and Palm Springs Desert Sun to observe.\n\nKoch said, \u201cThis isn\u2019t some secret cabal. We have ideas that will make American better.\u201d\n\nFor University of Akron senior Dominic Caruso, though, the rich are using their money to silence the people.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t want the people to talk. They want their money to talk,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s unfair. I don\u2019t have equal speech anymore because I don\u2019t have the money to make an ad. So I don\u2019t have equal speech to these wealthy people.\u201d\n\nhttp://limaohio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/web1_YourVoteOhioLogo-11.jpg http://limaohio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/1ad15gfx.pdf http://limaohio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/3ad15gfx.pdf John MacWherter views a political advertisement for Donald Trump with an emotive head set hooked up to his head during a research study at the Taylor Institute to determine if political advertising affects people on April 12 in Akron.
