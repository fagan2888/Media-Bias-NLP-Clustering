They are among the largest and longest-standing maneuvers conducted each year by the U.S. and its allies.\n\nThe kickoff of this year\u2019s exercises spurred North Korea to strongly condemn them and to test-fire several missiles to show its displeasure. On Saturday, the North\u2019s state media called the exercises an example of Washington\u2019s \u201cvicious hostile policy\u201d and obliquely warned it is ready to match any attempt to overthrow its ruling regime with an escalation to nuclear war.\n\n\u201cNuclear war is not a game. If the U.S. thinks it can survive and win a nuclear war, it will be a delusion of an idiot,\u201d said an editorial in the Rodong Sinmun, the mouthpiece of the ruling party. \u201cThe U.S. imperialists should not misjudge the firm will of the army and people of the DPRK to mercilessly smash the anti-DPRK hysterics and eliminate the source of evils.\u201d North Korea\u2019s official name is the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea.\n\nThe North often uses such rhetoric to voice displeasure with the U.S. and South Korea.\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s Defense Ministry has said the U.S. is sending a larger contingent of troops for the exercises than it did last year, but has not provided a specific number. About 5,200 American troops participated in last year\u2019s Key Resolve, which centers on computer simulations, while about 7,500 joined in the second stage of the maneuvers, called Foal Eagle, a field exercise spanning ground, air, naval and special operations.\n\nThe North has taken special umbrage this year at the participation in the exercises of the USS Fort Worth, a new kind of warship designed to fight in areas closer to shore than larger ships can enter and to counter attacks by swarms of smaller vessels, which is believed to be one of the strong points of North Korea\u2019s far less sophisticated navy.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Despite Pyongyang protests, US holds firm on military drills", "title": "Despite Pyongyang protests, US holds firm on military drills", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Despite Pyongyang protests, US holds firm on military drills", "title": "Despite Pyongyang protests, US holds firm on military drills", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/03/14/despite_pyongyang_protests_us_holds_firm_on_military_drills/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/south-korea-us-military-koreas-tension.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Despite Pyongyang protests, US holds firm on military drills", "title": "Despite Pyongyang protests, US holds firm on military drills", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/south-korea-us-military-koreas-tension.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Eric Talmadge", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdaddf\"", "article_summary": "Topics: From the Wires, NewsBUSAN, South Korea (AP) \u2014 Annual war games between South Korea and the U.S. military never fail to bring a loud outcry from North Korea.\nThe kickoff of this year\u2019s exercises spurred North Korea to strongly condemn them and to test-fire several missiles to show its displeasure.\nThe North often uses such rhetoric to voice displeasure with the U.S. and South Korea.\nSouth Korea\u2019s Defense Ministry has said the U.S. is sending a larger contingent of troops for the exercises than it did last year, but has not provided a specific number.\nThey are among the largest and longest-standing maneuvers conducted each year by the U.S. and its allies."}
