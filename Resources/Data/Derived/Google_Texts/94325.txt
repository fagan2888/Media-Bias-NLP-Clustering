From the current hit "The Martian" starring Matt Damon to the upcoming December film "Star Wars: The Force Awakens," Hollywood is producing movies about space at warp speed.

Still, for those who actually work and live in space, how accurate are these movies? CNBC's "Fast Money" turned to the authorities: International Space Station Cmdr. Scott Kelly, who set the U.S. record this month for the most time in space, and astronaut Dr. Kjell Lindgren.

"I thought 'Apollo 13' was a great movie because it portrayed the characters very well," said Kelly. "Certainly the movie 'Gravity,' although there was, you know, a lot about it that didn't really ring true on a personal level, the space station â€¦ looked very realistic." The $100 million Sandra Bullock and George Clooney vehicle became a critical darling and box office juggernaut after it debuted in 2013.

"I mean we watched that on board and it was almost kind of creepy seeing the space station that we're living in portrayed in such a vivid way," Kelly said about "Gravity's" realistic setting.
