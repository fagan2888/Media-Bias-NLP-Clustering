Who doesn't love getting a treat-filled gift basket — especially one that's been put together just for you? Think of the basket as an experience, not just a collection of things. Pick a theme like "pasta night" and fill it with noodles, your favorite sauce, a good bottle of olive oil, and other fixings all tucked into a colander. Other popular themes include movie-night munchies, or a chocolate basket. Whatever your theme, follow these pointers:

• Get the right stuff. You can go all store-bought, all homemade, or a little of both, but be sure to mix big and little items, and look for small, wallet-friendly goodies to fill in the empty spots. Dollar stores can be great places to snag a deal on teas, spices, and little jars of jam, mustard or other condiments.

• Plan the arrangement. Stagger items for a pleasing effect. Place larger things behind smaller ones, heavier ones beneath lighter ones. And don't place two breakable jars or containers next to each other. Instead, separate them with other objects and shredded paper, or if they must touch, place a wad of tacky putty in an inconspicuous spot to prevent banging. To finish and protect the contents, tie up the basket inside a large cellophane bag with a big ribbon or enclose it in shrink wrap.

• Think outside the basket. If you use baskets, avoid those with big handles across the top; they can get in the way when you're arranging. Or let the theme of your "basket" guide your choice of vessel; boxes, large galvanized tins, mixing bowls, ice buckets, colanders, and platters are good choices. Look for affordable ones at flea markets or dollar stores. To keep goodies from getting lost inside a deep container, create a false bottom; Place a small, empty cardboard box or Styrofoam block in the bottom. Cover with shredded paper, and tuck in gifts so that they are propped up and nicely displayed.
