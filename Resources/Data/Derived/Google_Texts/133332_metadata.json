Gary Herbert hope a compromise can be worked out over Healthy Utah and Utah Cares \u2013 the two competing government-sponsored health insurance plans for Utah\u2019s poorest, sickest people -- the hard political truth is the 63-member Utah GOP House caucus is still far away from doing what Herbert and state Republican senators want.\n\nAnd it remains unclear how far Herbert and the senators will retreat from the full 100 percent-to-138 percent coverage those Healthy Utah advocates demand.\n\nUtahPolicy has spoken to a number of House Republicans, inside and outside of leadership, to get a better understanding of Medicaid expansion\u2019s rocky road during the 45-day 2015 general legislative session, which ended March 12 with no resolution on expansion.\n\nThey agreed to speak not for attribution \u2013 as much work still remains on expansion and the six-member committee will be meeting in private and traveling to Washington, D.C., to confer with Obama administration officials.\n\nWhat is hoped, one GOP leader told UtahPolicy, is that federal officials will be eager to provide additional expansion waivers to Utah, to better shore up federal financing and/or health care provisions so Utah GOP House members, Herbert, and senators can each move off of their now-solid positions.\n\nTwenty-two Republican-controlled states have so far refused to accept the Medicaid expansion as provided by Obamacare \u2013 and further defined by U.S. Supreme Court decisions.\n\nHerbert has gotten, for Utah, more compromises out of federal Health and Human Services Department officials than any other state.\n\nAnd, this GOP leader said, if the Obama administration wants to get a very red state \u2013 Utah \u2013 to adopt a version of Medicaid expansion, then what better opportunity than now to make further compromises?\n\nShort of those federal waivers, this Republican sees a very hard row to move the House GOP caucus off of its strong Utah Cares support seen in the just-completed session.\n\n\u201cThere is the belief,\u201d this person said, \u201cthat we (House GOP leaders) will go back to D.C., learn for ourselves that the feds won\u2019t move (more on waivers or assurances) and then we come back\u201d and convince the House GOP caucus that they must accept Herbert\u2019s Healthy Utah expansion plan.\n\nBut the great frustration for House Republicans is that Herbert and GOP senators won\u2019t see the House has compromised \u2013 and moved \u2013 more off of their original Medicaid expansion stands.\n\nAnd that any real compromises now must come from the feds and/or Herbert and Senate Republicans.\n\nSome political facts that Herbert and senators apparently don\u2019t want to see, this person said:\n\n-- The House Republicans, out of 63 members, had 12 votes in December for Herbert\u2019s Healthy Utah.\n\nAfter closed caucuses and much discussion during the session \u2013 and pressure from Herbert and the Senate \u2013 the House caucus still only had 12 votes for Healthy Utah.\n\n\u201cWe hadn\u2019t moved an inch\u201d toward Healthy Utah, one Republican insider said.\n\nBut the caucus had moved on the Medicaid expansion issue.\n\nIn the December closed caucus, there were just short of 38 votes (a House majority) in the caucus for doing nothing on Medicaid expansion this general session.\n\nOther GOP-controlled states had decided the same thing \u2013 do nothing on Medicaid expansion and see how the federal government plays it out.\n\nYou\u2019ve heard the GOP House members\u2019 arguments before: The feds won\u2019t keep their commitment to the 90-10 percent funding match for several years. The feds, under great pressure to move toward a balanced federal budget, won\u2019t even keep the 70-30 percent match promise several years out of Utah adopting Medicaid expansion.\n\nHouse Republicans don\u2019t want to start a health care program that the state can\u2019t continue to support \u2013 either robbing other state programs for funds and/or cutting back on coverage promised Utah\u2019s poorest, sickest citizens.\n\nIn hindsight, GOP House members realize they lost the public relations battle over Herbert\u2019s Healthy Utah.\n\nIt was a mistake for new House Speaker Greg Hughes, R-Draper, to refuse to let the Healthy Utah bill, SB164, go to a House committee hearing, several House Republicans said.\n\nHughes was pounded on in the local media and on radio talk shows. A former boxer, Hughes said late in the session he gladly would be the \u201cpoint of the spear\u201d in the SB164 debate.\n\nThose close to the speaker told UtahPolicy that Hughes believed, since SB164 had only 12 votes in the 63-member House GOP caucus, that it would be clear to Herbert and Senate Republicans it was dead on arrival.\n\nThus, it would be a waste of time and energy to go to a hearing and take votes on the bill.\n\nAlso, when House Majority Leader Jim Dunnigan, R-Taylorsville, the House point man on Medicaid expansion, started seeing anonymous flyers showing up in his district bashing him on Healthy Utah, Hughes got mad, sources said, and decided just to fight back \u2013 as is sometimes his way.\n\nDuring the session, Hughes told UtahPolicy that out of his campaign funds he paid for a response flyer to go out to Dunnigan\u2019s district.\n\nAnd not wanting to see other of his House colleagues facing the \u201cpolitical pounding,\u201d as one GOP legislator put it, Hughes just decided not to bring to a committee or floor vote a bill that was clearly already dead.\n\nBut that was a political misstep, several House Republicans now admit.\n\nSB164 \u2013 Healthy Utah \u2013 did get a hearing in the House Business and Labor Standing Committee. It failed badly there.\n\nThen, two days later, in floor debate over the House Republican\u2019s alternative \u2013 Utah Cares, or HB446 \u2013 Democrats tried to substitute Healthy Utah into the Republican\u2019s bill. That attempt also failed, after some debate. (You can see both those Healthy Utah votes in the above links.)\n\nIn essence, then, Healthy Utah had a committee hearing and a vote \u2013 where it died. Then it had a floor debate, and a vote, where it died.\n\nHouse Republicans are frustrated that most Utahns STILL don\u2019t realize that Healthy Utah, Herbert\u2019s plan, had two debates in the House (after Hughes\u2019 had said it wouldn\u2019t be heard) \u2013 and was voted down twice.\n\nLessons were learned, several House Republicans told UtahPolicy.\n\nThe question now is, if a compromise can\u2019t be reached by the Committee of Six, how will that stalemate be played out in the public?\n\nWill Herbert call a summer special legislative session even if there is no compromised reached by the Six?\n\nWill 12 votes for Healthy Utah in the GOP House caucus somehow be turned into 38 votes in favor of it?\n\n(Currently, GOP House members UtahPolicy talked to don\u2019t see that happening.)\n\nIn his session-ending interview with UtahPolicy, Herbert flatly promised that the Committee of Six would find a compromise by July 31.\n\nBut House Republicans UtahPolicy spoke to aren\u2019t so sure.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve come a long way,\u201d one House GOP leader told UtahPolicy recently, on Medicaid expansion.\n\nIt\u2019s time, some GOP representatives believe, for the feds, Herbert and Senate Republicans to give some, also.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.", "article_metadata": {"description": "While no doubt all six members of the \u201csuper Medicaid committee\u201d organized by GOP Gov.
