Huh\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that Scott Walker is a very conservative governor. Indeed, Walker\u2019s unapologetic conservatism is the centerpiece of his presidential campaign. In his announcement speech on Monday, Walker touted his efforts to hobble unions, his work restricting access to abortion, his support for easier access to guns, his conservative fiscal policy and his efforts to make it harder to vote in the state of Wisconsin.\n\nA seemingly innocuous line in that speech, however, suggests that Walker\u2019s broader ideological goals are even more ambitious than his record as governor suggests. In three sentences laying out his overarching theory of government, Walker appears to align himself with political theorists, some of whom died more than a century ago, who would radically dismantle the American system of government. He also appears to align himself with more modern constitutional theorists who wish to reinstate long-discredited Supreme Court cases that would eliminate much of the legal framework protecting workers from exploitation.\n\nEchoing anti-government rhetoric that has been a mainstay of Republican stump speeches since the Reagan era, Walker declares his opposition to the so-called \u201ctop-down, government-knows-best approach we hear from politicians in Washington.\u201d Yet, in the next sentence of his speech, he describes his anti-government philosophy in very specific terms: \u201cAs long as you don\u2019t violate the health and safety of your neighbors \u2013 go out and start your own career, build your own business, live your own life.\u201d This framework, where people are free to do as they wish so long as they do not violate others \u201chealth\u201d or \u201csafety\u201d is the cornerstone of what Walker labels as \u201cfreedom.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also the cornerstone of an old conception of freedom which stretches back to the laissez faire attitudes of the Gilded Age.\n\n\u201cHealth and Safety\u201d\n\nChristopher Tiedeman is, outside of certain academic circles, a forgotten figure in American history. Yet, at the height of his influence, Tiedeman was arguably the most significant legal thinker in the United States who was not a member of the judiciary. He bragged in the 1900 edition to one of his treatises, for example, that \u201cthe first edition of the book has been quoted by the courts with approval in hundreds of cases.\u201d\n\nThat treatise explicitly rejected the notion that the right to govern flows from the consent of the governed, and instead called upon the judiciary to drastically limit government\u2019s powers. \u201c[T]he conservative classes,\u201d Tiedeman wrote, \u201cstand in constant fear of the advent of an absolutism more tyrannical and more unreasoning than any before experienced by man\u2014the absolutism of a democratic majority.\u201d To defeat what he imagined to be creeping tyranny, Tiedeman urged judges to \u201clay their interdict upon all legislative acts\u201d that violated a narrow vision of government power, and he urged them to do so \u201ceven though these acts do not violate any specific or special provision of the Constitution.\u201d\n\nThe Wisconsin Supreme Court\u2019s 1902 decision in Zillmer v. Kreutzberg was typically of the genre of cases that relied upon Tiedeman\u2019s writings in interpreting the law. In striking down a law prohibiting employers from firing workers because they joined a union, the court quoted from one of Tiedeman\u2019s treatises \u2014 \u201cit is the right of every one to determine whose services he will hire\u2026. Governments, therefore, cannot exert any restraint upon the actions of the parties.\u201d\n\nAs one scholarly examination of Tiedeman explains, the Gilded Age legal theorist\u2019s vision for when government action is appropriate closely resembled the philosophy Walker articulated on Monday \u2014 at least in the context of the workplace. Tiedeman \u201climited the legitimate regulation of the labor contract to the preservation of the health and safety of the worker, or to the protection against fraud.\u201d All other labor regulation, \u201cincluding regulation of workers\u2019 wages and hours-would violate the constitutional guarantee of liberty of contract, which Tiedeman argued was \u2018intended to operate equally and impartially upon both employer and employee.'\u201d\n\nEnter The Supreme Court\n\nIn 1905, the United States Supreme Court embraced a slightly more moderate version of Tiedeman\u2019s limits on government action in Lochner v. New York. Lochner is best known for reading a so-called \u201cright to contract\u201d into a provision of the Constitution which does not mention it, and then wielding this extra-textual \u201cright\u201d to constrain the government\u2019s ability to improve labor conditions for workers. Though Lochner is widely viewed as a major error by the Supreme Court \u2014 Chief Justice John Roberts recently described it as \u201cdiscredited\u201d in a decision joined by two of his fellow conservatives \u2014 there is a burgeoning political movement in the American right, which includes some judges, senators and columnist George Will, which believes that Lochner should be reinstated.\n\n(Will, it should be noted, disclosed in a column earlier this month that \u201c[t]his columnist\u2019s wife, Mari Will, works for Scott Walker.\u201d)\n\nLochner relied on the distinctly Tiedemanesque notion that government is allowed to legislate for a certain limited set of purposes and not for any others. Like Tiedeman, Lochner permitted workplace regulation for the limited purpose of advancing \u201chealth\u201d or \u201csafety.\u201d It also permitted legislation that involves \u201cthe morals\u201d or \u201cthe welfare of the public.\u201d But Lochner forbade laws that were enacted solely to advance what it viewed as an impermissible purpose \u2014 improving the lives of workers. These laws, Lochner concluded, were \u201can unreasonable, unnecessary and arbitrary interference with the right of the individual to his personal liberty or to enter into those contracts in relation to labor which may seem to him appropriate or necessary for the support of himself and his family.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that there is some disagreement among modern thinkers seeking to reinstate something similar to Lochner regarding whether this decision went far enough. Georgetown law professor Randy Barnett is the Christopher Tiedeman of 2015. Barnett was a major figure in the first Supreme Court lawsuit seeking to kill the Affordable Care Act. He\u2019s also written that he \u201cwould prefer that courts adopt a \u2018presumption of liberty\u2019 of the sort the Court seemed to employ in Lochner.\u201d Yet his other writings suggest that he views the Supreme Court\u2019s Lochner era jurisprudence as too moderate, at least on economic issues.\n\nIn a 2004 law review article, Barnett criticizes the Court in decisions handed down in the years leading up to Lochner for sometimes construing government power \u201cmore broadly than was proper.\u201d Specifically, Barnett complains, government power was typically construed to empower states to protect not only the \u2018health and safety\u2019 of the general public, but its \u2018morals\u2019 as well.\u201d Thus, Barnett would hew closer to Tiedeman\u2019s narrower framework for government power.\n\nSo What Of Scott Walker?\n\nOn the surface, Walker\u2019s views appear closer to Barnett and Tiedeman than they are to Lochner. After all, in his announcement speech, Walker says that people should be free from government action so long as they do not violate the \u201chealth and safety\u201d of their neighbors. He says nothing about laws regulating \u201cmorals.\u201d\n\nWalker\u2019s broader record, however, suggests that a Walker presidency would be the worst of all worlds for liberals. Though Walker\u2019s economic policies are consistent with a pro-Lochner agenda, he also seems quite content, at least in some cases, to wrap the crushing hand of government around individuals who violate his own personal moral code. This is, after all, the same Scott Walker who voted for a constitutional amendment protecting marriage discrimination, and who even opposed a law protecting the right of one member of a same-sex couple to visit their sick partner in the hospital.\n\nNevertheless, Walker\u2019s statement about \u201chealth and safety,\u201d when read in light of the wide range of libertarian literature that calls for a similar anti-government philosophy to be read into the Constitution, may offer some window into one of the most obscure aspects of his candidacy \u2014 who he would appoint to the federal bench and, potentially, to the Supreme Court, if elected president.\n\nIn Wisconsin, judges are typically elected and judgeships are only filled by a gubernatorial appointment when a vacancy arises. Accordingly, Walker has appointed fairly few judges and no members of his state\u2019s supreme court. At a conservative legal conference in 2013, Walker hinted that he may appoint Judge Diane Sykes, a federal appeals court judge who backed voter ID laws and who wrote an opinion that SCOTUSBlog\u2019s Lyle Denniston once described as \u201cthe broadest ruling so far by a federal appeals court barring enforcement of the birth-control mandate in the new federal health care law.\u201d But his record as governor is too thin to predict whether he would take up George Will\u2019s call to reinstate Lochner.\n\nWalker\u2019s announcement speech, however, puts some flesh on the bare bones of his record on judicial appointments. It echoes the rhetoric of more than a century of judges and scholars who read workplace deregulation into the Constitution. And it suggests that, should Walker have the opportunity to name Supreme Court justices, all of American law could swiftly take a hard right turn.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "In three sentences laying out his overarching theory of government, Walker appears to align himself with political theorists, some of whom who died more than a century ago, who would radically dismantle the American system of government.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "In three sentences laying out his overarching theory of government, Walker appears to align himself with political theorists, some of whom who died more than a century ago, who would radically dismantle the American system of government.", "title": "The Right-Wing Dog Whistle Buried In Scott Walker\u2019s Announcement Speech", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2015/07/14/3680245/scott-walker-radical-libertarianism/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Scott-Walker.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "In three sentences laying out his overarching theory of government, Walker appears to align himself with political theorists, some of whom who died more than a century ago, who would radically dismantle the American system of government.", "creator": "@imillhiser", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Scott-Walker-321x214.jpg", "title": "The Right-Wing Dog Whistle Buried In Scott Walker\u2019s Announcement Speech", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-justice", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Scott-Walker.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Scott-Walker.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-14T12:23:58+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/IanMillhiserPublic"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "Justice The Right-Wing Dog Whistle Buried In Scott Walker\u2019s Announcement Speech CREDIT: AP Photo/Nam Y.
