Tight ends remain a staple of Gary Kubiak’s offense. So it was no coincidence that the Broncos opened free agency by re-signing Virgil Green and adding Owen Daniels. And they aren’t done, Kubiak told The Post on Wednesday.

“We’d love to have (Jacob) Tamme back,” Kubiak said. “There’s still conversations going on. We are trying to get better and be smart through the process, but in fact I will talk to him some point today.”

Tamme has served as a reserve tight end and key special teams contributor. He is interested in returning to Denver, but is keeping an open mind.

Daniels met the media on Wednesday and explained Kubiak’s offense. Or at least from his position. The challenge, he said, is to make every play look the same to set up play action.

“The offense isn’t as simple as people think. We changed tempos, we ran some muddle no-huddle, did a lot of different things,” Daniels said. “And coach Kubiak expects you to execute it well. He holds himself accountable, and he holds us to the same standard.”
