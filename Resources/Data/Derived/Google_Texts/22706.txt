Despite continued Republican efforts to repeal Obamacare, a key component of the law that has given millions of people health coverage — Medicaid expansion — could prove very difficult to undo, experts say.

A growing number of states have signed up for that expansion of the government-run program for poor people, or are discussing doing so. Hospitals are becoming accustomed to the money that comes with expansion, and a majority of new enrollees are saying they are happy with their coverage.

The difficulty of getting rid of Medicaid expansion, which uses federal dollars to give health benefits to previously ineligible adults, was sharply underscored this fall by the election of ardent Obamacare foe Matt Bevin as governor of Kentucky.

The Republican Bevin originally promised to repeal expansion of Medicaid in Kentucky, where about 400,000 have joined the Medicaid rolls since the Affordable Care Act was implemented. He since has backed away from that vow. Bevin most recently has talked about redesigning the state's Medicaid program, but has not yet offered a plan.

At the same time, this month the new Democratic governor of Louisiana, John Bel Edwards, has signed an executive order to expand Medicaid. That state expects about 300,000 people to join its Medicaid rolls by this summer.

Louisiana is the 31st state to expand Medicaid; Washington, D.C., also has expanded benefits. Three other states, South Dakota, Wyoming and Virginia, are discussing such a move.
