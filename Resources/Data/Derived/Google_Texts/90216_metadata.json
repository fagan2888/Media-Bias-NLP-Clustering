Johnson VA Medical Center.\n\nThe Fisher House, similar in concept to a Ronald McDonald House, could open as early as next year on the site of the former McAlister-Smith Funeral Home at 150 Wentworth St.\n\nFamily members of patients at the hospital will be able to stay for free in the 14,000-square-foot facility, which will include 16 bedroom suites and common kitchen, living and dining areas, said Trux Emerson, who retired from a residential real estate career and now lives on Kiawah Island.\n\nThe house will help many families who can\u2019t afford Charleston\u2019s hotel rates, and it also will offer guests a supportive environment.\n\n\u201cIt will have a personality and life of its own,\u201d Emerson said. \u201cIt\u2019s very healing.\u201d\n\nThe idea to open a Fisher House originally came from U.S. Marine Corps, Maj. Gen. James Livingston, a Medal of Honor recipient. Emerson met with Livingston to brainstorm different ideas, and Livingston told him the area desperately needed a Fisher House.\n\nEmerson said he originally thought about organizing a golf tournament to raise about $30,000 for a good cause. But he ultimately got swept up into fundraising for the Fisher House and has helped raise $8 million of the required $10 million for the project.\n\nThe Fisher House Foundation operates 50 facilities in the U.S. and abroad, and five more are under construction, according to the foundation\u2019s website. The foundation has recognized the need for 17 more, including one in Charleston, but the Charleston effort faced an unusual problem.\n\nFisher Houses must be built on federal land, and there weren\u2019t any suitable parcels of federal land large enough near the city\u2019s VA hospital, Emerson said.\n\nSo the Emersons raised $4 million and purchased the land on Wentworth Street, which they are donating to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.\n\nThe Fisher House Foundation will build the facility, which is expected to cost about $6 million.\n\nEmerson said he currently is waiting for the federal government to officially accept the land, and he\u2019s not sure how long that will take. After it\u2019s accepted, construction can begin.\n\nSpokeswoman Tonya Lobbestael said the Charleston VA hospital, which serves the coast from North Carolina to Hinesville, Ga., has hoped for a Fisher House for years.\n\nCurrently, many family member have to make long daily trips to visit patients, while others rack up big bills at local hotels or simply stay in their loved one\u2019s room.\n\nEmerson said he hopes the house can open its doors by Christmas 2017, but that might be wishful thinking.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re ready to go as soon as we\u2019re given the green light.\u201d\n\nReach Diane Knich at 843-937-5491 on Twitter @dianeknich.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Lodging for VA patients\u2019 families in the works, FP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNewsMetro, \r\nMetro, Fisher House,Ralph H.
