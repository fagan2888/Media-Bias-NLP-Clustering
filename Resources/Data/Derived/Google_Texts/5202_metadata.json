I was very confident he\u2019d offer a good performance and that\u2019s exactly what he did. He\u2019s a fighter out there, he battles hard and he never quits.\u201d\n\nPickard earned his first win of the season in part because the Avalanche capitalized on six Sharks penalties, scoring four power play goals, the most they\u2019ve tallied with the man advantage in one game this season. Nathan MacKinnon earned his second career hat trick in the win.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t expect that every night,\u201d Pickard said, referring to his six goals of support. \u201cBut to get that in my first start this year is greatly appreciated.\u201d\n\nMacKinnon opened the scoring by converting a 3-on-2 on the power play at 8:46 of the first period, snapping his 14-game goalless drought. The goal also marked the 10th consecutive game in which the Avalanche have scored the game\u2019s first goal.\n\n\u201cTough slump, obviously, it was 14 games,\u201d MacKinnon said. \u201cThey come in bunches sometimes and, obviously, it\u2019s nice to get on the board and get the win.\u201d\n\nAfter Patrick Marleau tied the game less than two minutes later, the Avalanche went to work on the power play again at 14:28 of the opening frame. This time, Carl Soderberg deflected a point shot from Francois Beauchemin. He also collected two assists in the game for a three-point night.\n\n\u201cI thought Soderberg, it was probably his best game since he joined the team,\u201d Roy said. \u201cHe was phenomenal, sharp on the power play, made good plays.\u201d\n\nThe Avalanche notched two more power play tallies in the third period after Matt Duchene and Melker Karlsson swapped goals in the second.\n\nFirst, Blake Comeau redirected a shot from Erik Jonhson to stretch the Avalanche\u2019s lead to 4-2, and after Tomas Hertl made it a one-goal game, MacKinnon recorded his second of the game by putting the puck into the roof.\n\nThe Avalanche\u2019s explosion with the man advantage was particularly impressive considering the Sharks had killed off 21 straight penalties prior to MacKinnon\u2019s first period goal.\n\n\u201cWe have so many different options [on the power play],\u201d MacKinnon said. \u201cAll of our goals were from a different variety \u2014 a tip, off the rush, backdoor. It\u2019s good to get on it.\u201d\n\nMacKinnon eventually completed his hat trick at 18:32 in the third period scoring an empty-net goal.\n\nThe win was the Avalanche\u2019s first at the Shark Tank in 13 games dating back to Feb. 6, 2008.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Calvin Pickard\u2019s 35 saves, Nathan MacKinnon\u2019s hat trick power Avs\u2019 victory over Sharks", "title": "Calvin Pickard\u2019s 35 saves, Nathan MacKinnon\u2019s hat trick power Avs\u2019 victory over Sharks", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/12/28/calvin-pickards-35-saves-nathan-mackinnons-hat-trick-power-avs-victory-over-sharks/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151228__avalanche-sharksp1.jpg", "height": 471}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151228__avalanche-sharksp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-28T23:15:07+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-19T22:04:25+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWe have so many different options [on the power play],\u201d MacKinnon said.\nIt\u2019s good to get on it.\u201dMacKinnon eventually completed his hat trick at 18:32 in the third period scoring an empty-net goal.\n\u201cHe was phenomenal, sharp on the power play, made good plays.\u201dThe Avalanche notched two more power play tallies in the third period after Matt Duchene and Melker Karlsson swapped goals in the second.\nThe win was the Avalanche\u2019s first at the Shark Tank in 13 games dating back to Feb. 6, 2008.\nNathan MacKinnon earned his second career hat trick in the win."}
