The justices obviously were fishing for a compromise between the parties to avoid another in what could become a string of high-profile stalemates.\n\nAs Harvard Law Professor Noah Feldman put it in his Bloomberg View column, \u201cThe Supreme Court is getting desperate.\u201d\n\nWith good reason. The court has been reduced from nine members to eight since the Feb. 13 death of Antonin Scalia, and the remaining justices are evenly divided into two blocs whose members typically vote together on legal questions that divide liberals and conservatives in the political realm.\n\nThe justices have split 4-4 twice in the seven weeks since Scalia died. The deadlocks came on a lending discrimination case from Missouri and a challenge by six California schoolteachers opposed to mandatory union dues.\n\nTo many observers, the dues dispute, Friedrichs vs. California Teachers Association, was the biggest case on the court\u2019s docket this year.\n\nWith the Senate\u2019s Republican leadership refusing to consider the president\u2019s nomination of Judge Merrick Garland to succeed Scalia, Friedrichs almost certainly won\u2019t be the last case that results in a 4-4 vote.\n\nAmong the pending cases considered likely to produce non-decisions are challenges to President Barack Obama\u2019s executive orders on immigration, a Texas law restricting access to abortion and admission policies at the University of Texas that take race into consideration. Another one involves the meaning of \u201cone person, one vote\u201d in the context of drawing state legislative districts.\n\nA split decision on the Supreme Court leaves the lower court ruling in effect.\n\nIn the Friedrichs case, that means that a Supreme Court precedent stands. But on several pending issues, lower courts have issued conflicting rulings, leaving the country without a settled legal standard. No one benefits from that.\n\nSenate GOP leader Mitch McConnell says Scalia\u2019s seat on the court should be filled by the next president. That would leave the court shorthanded not just for the remainder of this term, which ends in June, but for most \u2014 if not all \u2014 of its next term, too.\n\nThe court reconvenes in October, but the new president won\u2019t take office until Jan. 20. Among the 10 most recent Supreme Court appointments, the shortest period between a presidential nomination and Senate confirmation was 50 days. The longest was 99. So the best-case scenario appears to be confirmation in mid-March of next year \u2014 a little more than two months before the court adjourns its 2016-17 session.\n\nMcConnell says voters ought to have a say in choosing Scalia\u2019s successor. The voters can judge only if the candidates identify their choices prior to the election. Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have called for a confirmation vote on Garland. Donald Trump, Ted Cruz and John Kasich oppose a vote. They ought to tell voters who they would choose.\n\nFor now, be prepared for a lot of 4-4 votes. That isn\u2019t what\u2019s meant by balancing the scales of justice.", "article_metadata": {"description": "No one should be surprised that the U.S. Supreme Court deadlocked this", "story version": 2016, "og": {"site_name": "Santa Rosa Press Democrat", "description": "The court has been reduced from nine members to eight since the Feb. 13 death of Antonin Scalia, and the remaining justices are evenly divided into two blocs whose members typically vote together on legal questions that divide liberals and conservatives in the political realm.", "title": "PD Editorial: One short, the Supreme Court is all tied up", "url": "http://www.pressdemocrat.com/opinion/5450655-181/pd-editorial-one-short-the", "image": "http://www.pressdemocrat.com/csp/mediapool/sites/dt.common.streams.StreamServer.cls?STREAMOID=ZiJMIooL7O4Q66aucsrvEs$daE2N3K4ZzOUsqbU5sYthSy5Hg$X6Ej2s7nIpi63FWCsjLu883Ygn4B49Lvm9bPe2QeMKQdVeZmXF$9l$4uCZ8QDXhaHEp3rvzXRJFdy0KqPHLoMevcTLo3h8xh70Y6N_U_CryOsw6FTOdKL_jpQ-&CONTENTTYPE=image/jpeg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100003031242373, "app_id": 125780984227497}, "msvalidate.01": "9E66801B649686495190ABE3DA8985E7", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pressdemocrat", "published_time": "2016-04-02T00:11:00-08:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "As Harvard Law Professor Noah Feldman put it in his Bloomberg View column, \u201cThe Supreme Court is getting desperate.\u201dWith good reason.\nA split decision on the Supreme Court leaves the lower court ruling in effect.\nAmong the 10 most recent Supreme Court appointments, the shortest period between a presidential nomination and Senate confirmation was 50 days.\nIn the Friedrichs case, that means that a Supreme Court precedent stands.\nNo one should be surprised that the U.S. Supreme Court deadlocked this week on a politically charged case involving public employee union dues."}
