The APA published a new list of questionable uses for such medications as part of its \u201cChoosing Wisely\u201d campaign criticizing overuse of treatments, such as antibiotics for cold viruses and other inappropriate scenarios, contributing to the development of drug-resistant bacteria known as \u201csuperbugs.\u201d\n\nThe APA says doctors frequently misuse older antipsychotic medications intended for conditions such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, as well as newer antipsychotics prescribed more frequently for behavioral problems in elderly nursing home residents and children with aggressive behaviors or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.\n\nJoel Yager, a psychiatry professor at the University of Colorado, Boulder, helped to develop the list for the APA. Physicians who overuse such medications act with good intentions and \u201care doing what they think might help,\u201d he told USA Today. However, they should first try safer and more efficacious alternatives to these antipsychotic medications, he said.\n\nThe APA-led coalition of medical groups warns against the use of antipsychotics without full medical evaluations and continual monitoring. Doctors should also avoid prescribing the drugs in combination without first trying several medications first, using a strategy of trial and error. Antipsychotics should not be a first-line treatment. Common side effects of antipsychotics may include confusion, sedation, and early death. Also, children and teenagers with conditions other than psychotic disorders should not be given such medications, given research linking such drugs to weight gain, cardiovascular changes, and an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. Poor and minority children are most likely to receive such medications in the absence of a psychotic disorder, the APA says.\n\nTo that end, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services is investigating the possible overuse of antipsychotic medications among children covered by Medicaid, The Wall Street Journal reported last month. Meanwhile, the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services says an earlier campaign to reduce such prescriptions among elderly people in nursing homes led to a 9 percent drop in the first year, as medical providers, government agencies, and the public banded together.\n\n\"This is a way to get the message out to the health community at large,\u201d Yager said of the Choosing Wisely campaign.\n\nBelow is a video about overuse of antipsychotic medications among elderly populations in nursing homes.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "choosing wisely, antipsychotic medication overused, overuse of antipsychotic medications, antipsychotic medications for adhd", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "The American Psychological Association warns in a new public information campaign about the growing overuse of antipsychotic medications for a variety of conditions and ailments.", "title": "Antipsychotic Meds Overprescribed For Hyper Children And Nursing Home Residents", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/antipsychotic-medications-overprescribed-everything-hyper-children-nursing-home-residents-video", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/21/apa-antipsychotic-medications-overused.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The American Psychological Association warns in a new public information campaign about the growing overuse of antipsychotic medications for a variety of conditions and ailments.", "title": "Antipsychotic Meds Overprescribed For Hyper Children And Nursing Home Residents", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/antipsychotic-medications-overprescribed-everything-hyper-children-nursing-home-residents-video", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/21/apa-antipsychotic-medications-overused.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/21/apa-antipsychotic-medications-overused.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Policy/Biz", "published_time": "2013-09-21T18:40:04-04:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-23T09:20:10-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "The American Psychological Association warns in a new public information campaign about the growing overuse of antipsychotic medications for a variety of conditions and ailments."}, "article_summary": "Below is a video about overuse of antipsychotic medications among elderly populations in nursing homes.\nHowever, they should first try safer and more efficacious alternatives to these antipsychotic medications, he said.\nThe overuse of antipsychotic medications has gained the attention of America\u2019s doctors, as medical groups groups add the drug class to a host of overused medical interventions including antibiotics and colonoscopies, among others.\nThe APA-led coalition of medical groups warns against the use of antipsychotics without full medical evaluations and continual monitoring.\nTo that end, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services is investigating the possible overuse of antipsychotic medications among children covered by Medicaid, The Wall Street Journal reported last month."}
