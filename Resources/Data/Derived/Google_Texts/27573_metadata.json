My wife and I both work, and we make about $115,000 a year, but virtually all of her income goes toward paying the gymnastics bill. We\u2019re also trying to get out of debt and get better control of our money at the same time. Should we focus more on our finances right now?\n\nIf I were in your shoes, I\u2019d be asking myself why the kids are in gymnastics. Unless you guys are trying to send them to the Olympics \u2014 and they\u2019re actually good enough to reach that level \u2014 teaching them things like discipline and to master their bodies through physical training can be done at a local amateur level. And at a much lower cost.\n\nMy son played ice hockey in local leagues for years when he was growing up. We did it as a family thing, and he had lots of fun and we all made great new friends. He even played some in high school, too, but he wasn\u2019t NHL material or anything like that. It didn\u2019t change his life that he didn\u2019t play on a traveling team or with professional trainers, so we had to ask ourselves, \u201cWhat will it matter when he\u2019s 30 years old?\u201d\n\nYou make good money, so that\u2019s not really the big issue. If you guys made $50,000 or less, I\u2019d be yelling at you. But with your income, the gymnastics thing probably isn\u2019t going to slow you down too much when it comes to getting your financial house in order. In other words, it\u2019s a parental thing. Ask yourself why you\u2019re investing so heavily in this, and what the goal is when they\u2019re adults. I think that will help you make the smart decision.\n\nMy husband and I have been living bicoastal since last October. He found a great job with great pay in Charlottesville, Va., after graduation, and we both agreed he couldn\u2019t pass it up. I\u2019m still in Portland, Ore., with a good marketing job making $50,000 a year. We\u2019re trying to get out of debt. If I join him now, I won\u2019t have a job and we won\u2019t pay off our debt as quickly. But being apart is so difficult. Should I go ahead and make the move now?\n\nIf he\u2019s making great money, and you guys can make it on one salary while you look for another job, then I\u2019d say go for it. There are things in life that are more important than money, getting out of debt in a certain amount of time, or a particular job.\n\nHave you talked to your company about the possibility of doing your job remotely? If that\u2019s not possible, maybe you could do some consulting on a remote basis. Even if you weren\u2019t a traditional employee, they might float some projects your way.\n\nTalk to them about these ideas, and start shopping for a position in Charlottesville. It\u2019s a university community, so there are probably lots of opportunities in your field.\n\nGo be with your husband. You guys have been apart way too long already.\n\nDave Ramsey is a personal money management expert, author and national radio personality.
