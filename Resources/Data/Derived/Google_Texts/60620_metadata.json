Of the 8,170 services examined, less than 1% (38) were outstanding and 58% (4,381) were good, according to the chief executive\u2019s report, which was delivered last Wednesday.\n\nThe CQC\u2019s chief inspector of adult social care, Andrea Sutcliffe, told the Observer that the figures were extremely worrying. They will raise fresh concerns about the state of the sector after social care providers and council leaders warned in a joint submission to the Treasury last week that the fragility of the care sector was affecting their ability to perform their legal duties to elderly and disabled people.\n\nEarlier this year, this newspaper revealed that the CQC was receiving more than 150 allegations of abuse of the frail and elderly in social care settings every day, prompting Sutcliffe to warn that a broken system was turning good people into bad carers as a consequence of poor working conditions, a lack of training and inadequate staffing.\n\nThere is also growing evidence of the crisis having an effect on the health system. A key part of the reason why Addenbrooke\u2019s hospital in Cambridge, one of the NHS\u2019s most prestigious hospitals, was put into special measures last week was that 200 of its beds were being occupied by patients who could not leave because there was a lack of social care in place to support them.\n\nLast week\u2019s appeal to the Treasury by providers and local authorities in advance of the government\u2019s November spending review was made in recognition of the \u201cunprecedented scale and severity of the financial challenges facing the whole of the social care sector\u201d.\n\nSince 2010, cuts in council-funded adult social care have totalled \u00a34.6bn, or 31% in real terms of net budgets. And these budgets will be cut by a further \u00a3500m this year.\n\nThe Association of Directors of Adult Social Care, which commissions services, and groups representing providers said that if the growth in numbers of older and disabled people is taken into account, an additional \u00a31.1bn will be needed just to provide the same level of service as last year. The funding crisis in the sector is expected to be exacerbated by the introduction of the national living wage, which will bring the minimum hourly rate up to \u00a39 an hour by 2020.\n\nJudy Downey, chair of the Relatives and Residents Association, which campaigns for better standards in social care, said it was \u201cnot on\u201d for the government to continue to turn a blind eye to the financial crisis in the sector, to the high turnover of staff and to plummeting standards. She added that the state should take responsibility for training staff to work in social care settings. \u201cWe don\u2019t ask Eton to train their teachers, or Harley Street to train their doctors,\u201d Downey said.\n\nColin Angel, policy and campaigns director at the UK Home Care Association, which represents providers of services to people in their own homes, said it appeared that the most severe drop in standards was in nursing homes, where it was increasingly difficult to hire appropriately trained staff. \u201cWhile CQC\u2019s new ratings show the home-care sector delivering significantly better results than residential nursing care, it is difficult to imagine how adult social care as a whole can achieve marked improvements during a financial crisis,\u201d said Angel.\n\n\u201cRecruiting experienced nurses for residential care is increasingly challenging, and the turnover of home-care workers is unacceptably high due to the terms and conditions available, particularly given employers\u2019 fears over bearing the yet unfunded costs of the forthcoming national living wage.\u201d\n\nSutcliffe concluded: \u201cI am glad that the majority of the adult social care services we have rated so far are proving to provide safe, high-quality, effective and compassionate care. However, that 34% of services rated to date require improvement and 7% are inadequate is extremely worrying because of the detrimental impact these deficiencies can have on the health and wellbeing of people using services.\n\n\u201cWe have been prioritising our inspections according to risks and concerns, so our findings may show a higher proportion of poor care at this stage than when all 25,000 services have been inspected at least once by next September.\n\n\u201cNevertheless, it is unacceptable for people to be let down by services that are meant to give them the care and support they need, and we are committed to tackling poor care when we find it. We will continue to be a strong regulator, setting clear expectations for providers to improve and by taking action to force that improvement, if necessary.\n\n\u201cHowever, all parts of the adult social care system need to play their part to make sure people can receive the high standard of care that they deserve and that we expect. That includes providers taking their obligations to the people they serve seriously and supporting their staff, as well as commissioners and funders providing the appropriate resources for them to do so.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#005689", "description": "Five years of funding cuts blamed for crisis threatening the welfare of elderly and disabled people", "application-name": "The Guardian", "author": "Daniel Boffey", "og": {"site_name": "the Guardian", "description": "Five years of funding cuts blamed for crisis threatening the welfare of elderly and disabled people", "title": "Half of all services now failing as UK care sector crisis deepens", "url": "http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/sep/26/nearly-half-social-care-services-failing-uk-elderly-disabled-welfare", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0484001df59e53f6aa1c512224ff77281206bd5a/0_105_5128_3076/master/5128.jpg?w=1200&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=ca53d0f3268567df2cc350899c613d8f", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"app": {"url": {"ipad": "gnmguardian://society/2015/sep/26/nearly-half-social-care-services-failing-uk-elderly-disabled-welfare?contenttype=Article&source=twitter", "googleplay": "guardian://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/sep/26/nearly-half-social-care-services-failing-uk-elderly-disabled-welfare", "iphone": "gnmguardian://society/2015/sep/26/nearly-half-social-care-services-failing-uk-elderly-disabled-welfare?contenttype=Article&source=twitter"}, "id": {"ipad": 409128287, "iphone": 409128287, "googleplay": "com.guardian"}, "name": {"ipad": "The Guardian", "googleplay": "The Guardian", "iphone": "The Guardian"}}, "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/0484001df59e53f6aa1c512224ff77281206bd5a/0_105_5128_3076/master/5128.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@guardian"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Guardian", "al": {"ios": {"url": "gnmguardian://society/2015/sep/26/nearly-half-social-care-services-failing-uk-elderly-disabled-welfare?contenttype=Article&source=applinks", "app_store_id": 409128287, "app_name": "The Guardian"}}, "HandheldFriendly": "True", "fb": {"app_id": 180444840287}, "theme-color": "#005689", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/favicons/f06f6996e193d1ddcd614ea852322d25/windows_tile_144_b.png", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "keywords": "Social care,NHS,Health,Society,UK news,Politics,Economic policy,Older people,Disability", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theguardian", "published_time": "2015-09-26T22:45:02.000Z", "author": "https://www.theguardian.com/profile/daniel-boffey", "section": "Society", "modified_time": "2016-05-07T14:56:10.000Z", "tag": "Social care,NHS,Health,Society,UK news,Politics,Economic policy,Older people,Disability"}, "thumbnail": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0484001df59e53f6aa1c512224ff77281206bd5a/0_105_5128_3076/5128.jpg?w=620&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=b7e0148c6fdb082a83bbc65b0cc80c75", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Social care,NHS,Health,Society,UK news,Politics,Economic policy,Older people,Disability"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce509\"", "article_summary": "An update given to the board of the Care Quality Commission last week showed that 41% of community-based adult social care services, hospice services and residential social care services inspected since last October were inadequate or required improvement.\nThe CQC\u2019s chief inspector of adult social care, Andrea Sutcliffe, told the Observer that the figures were extremely worrying.\nSince 2010, cuts in council-funded adult social care have totalled \u00a34.6bn, or 31% in real terms of net budgets.\n\u201cHowever, all parts of the adult social care system need to play their part to make sure people can receive the high standard of care that they deserve and that we expect.\nNearly half of social care services visited by inspectors in the past year were found to be failing the frail and vulnerable, in what relatives and experts say is a symptom of the growing financial crisis in the sector."}
