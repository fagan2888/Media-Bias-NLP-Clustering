Administrative law is unrecognized by the Constitution, but, according to Columbia Law School Professor Philip Hamburger, it \u201chas become the government\u2019s primary mode of controlling Americans.\u201d He observes that \u201cadministrative law has avoided much rancor because its burdens have been felt mostly by corporations.\u201d This is where you come in: \u201cIncreasingly, however, administrative law has extended its reach to individuals. The entire society therefore now has opportunities to feel its hard edge.\u201d\n\nProfessor Hamburger\u2019s assessment of the proliferation of administrative law may be an understatement. Formal administrative law \u2014 the regulations promulgated by the alphabet soup of federal agencies \u2014 dwarfs the laws enacted by Congress. To take one vivid example from the front pages of the news in the Age of Obama, the Affordable Care Act (a/k/a Obamacare) runs for 2,800 pages. Democratic House majority leader Nancy Pelosi famously predicted that we would have to pass the bill to find out what was in it. Pelosi was right in more ways than one. By one count published last year, the regulations implementing the act have consumed 10,000 closely printed pages of the Federal Register, at 30 times the length (in words) of the law passed by Congress.\n\nI wrote about the inconsistency of administrative law with what we understand to be our constitutional system in \u201cCrisis of the administrative state.\u201d Searching around online for additional sources of learning on the subject, I happened to discover a listing for Professor Hamburger\u2019s then forthcoming book, Is Administrative Law Unlawful?\n\nProfessor Hamburgers\u2019s book has now been reviewed both in the Wall Street Journal (behind the Journal\u2019s subscription paywall) and the Weekly Standard. I reviewed the book for the August 11 issue of National Review. My NR review appears online as \u201cA new old regime.\u201d See also the essay on the book by Boston University School of Law Professor Gary Lawson forthcoming in the Texas Law Review, \u201cThe return of the king.\u201d\n\nProfessor Hamburger demonstrates the regressive nature of the Progressive project. He explains and vindicates the original project of the Constitution in erecting barriers to the exercise of absolute power. As Barack Obama brings the crisis of the administrative state to full boil, attention must be paid.\n\nProfessor Hamburger gave the keynote speech this past Friday at the George Mason University Law School\u2019s Law and Economics Center program on administrative law (videos of the program are now posted here). Professor Hamburgers\u2019s keynote speech summarizes the themes of his book in 10 points. His speech is posted here and below.\n\nProfessor Hamburger\u2019s speech takes up the first part of the video. I watched the speech live online on Friday and thought Professor Hamburger was on fire in these remarks. Following his speech, he was questioned by senior DC Circuit Judge Douglas Ginsburg. All together the video runs 47 minutes, but Professor Hamburger\u2019s speech takes up only the first half or so.
