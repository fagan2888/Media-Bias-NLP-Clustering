Along the way citizens lined the roads to take pictures. Some held American flags. Others had young children in their arms, who waved at the passing U.S. military vehicles.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great experience, it\u2019s very humbling,\u201d said Army Sgt. Greg Odom, part of Iron Troop. \u201cWaving at them, them waving back, smiling. You can tell you\u2019re bringing joy to them.\u201d The unexpectedly large turnout along Iron Troop\u2019s route underscores a pervasive regional anxiety about the Ukraine conflict, which many fear is a bellwether for future Russian aggression in the Baltics.\n\n\u201cI think everyone in Latvia who values freedom is concerned about what\u2019s going on in Ukraine,\u201d said Viktor, a 57-year-old father of three who took his family to see the convoy at a stop on the outskirts of the Latvian capital of Riga on Sunday.\n\nViktor, who held an American flag in his hand as he talked, said NATO should build a permanent base in one of the three Baltic countries to deter Russia.\n\nHe also pressed the U.S. to arm Ukraine, adding: \u201cWhat\u2019s the alternative? If the bad guy wants to go into your house, do you let him into your house or go out and buy a stronger lock? I consider not arming Ukraine a big mistake.\u201d\n\nFor 90 days, 3/2 soldiers have been deployed to Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland supporting Operation Atlantic Resolve, a series of U.S. exercises in Eastern Europe meant to \u201creassure NATO allies and partners of America\u2019s dedication to enduring peace and stability in the region, in light of the Russian intervention in Ukraine,\u201d according to a Department of Defense statement.\n\nThe convoy, called Operation Dragoon Ride, is the capstone to 3/2\u2019s Baltic deployment. The unit\u2019s personnel and their Stryker armored fighting vehicles, along with a host of support vehicles and local police escorts, are traveling 1,100 miles by road from Estonia to Vilseck, Germany.\n\nIron Troop\u2019s 150 soldiers\u2014who only two decades ago would have been considered enemies of the Soviet army controlling the region\u2014weren\u2019t sure how civilians would receive them, or if the convoy would receive much attention. But they have experienced a remarkably enthusiastic response, which reminded some soldiers of scenes of the U.S. Army liberating countries in World War II.\n\n\u201cIt reminds me of a scene from \u2018Band of Brothers\u2019 or \u2018Saving Private Ryan,\u2019\u201d said Army Lt. Dan Keogh of Iron Troop.\n\n\u201cYou see them along the road, waving at you. They come up and want to shake your hand,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019d say 90 to 95 percent of the people are very glad we\u2019re here and wishing we\u2019d stick around. It makes them feel very secure that we\u2019re in the area.\u201d\n\nThe convoy ended its first day in Parnu, Estonia Saturday, where a local military brass band braved the subzero temperatures to play American tunes, including \u201cHail to the Chief.\u201d Crowds weaved through the parked Strykers and Humvees on static display, on which children climbed like jungle gyms.\n\nConversations between soldiers and civilians drifted between recommendations about Estonian beer to what Russian President Vladimir Putin might do next.\n\n\u201cEstonians are worried about a war between Russia and the United States,\u201d said Boris, 37, an Estonian who attended Saturday\u2019s Stryker display in Parnu with his three-year-old son. \u201cWe see the news. We see what\u2019s happening in Ukraine. This is a war. This is our reality.\u201d\n\nDragoon Ride has also highlighted the high regard NATO allies have for the U.S. military.\n\n\u201cIf America is here, there will be no problem,\u201d said Estonian Private First Class Richard Kuusk. \u201cThe Estonian military is small and not very strong, so it\u2019s important for the U.S. to be here. We see what\u2019s happening in Ukraine, and we don\u2019t want that to happen here.\u201d\n\nSunday\u2019s journey ended in the Latvian capital of Riga. Despite the cold and wind, anxious crowds gathered and waited to greet the troops at villages along the route. Young children posed with obliging U.S. soldiers as mothers and fathers snapped photos. Lines formed at the back of Strykers with those anxious to look inside or shake a soldier\u2019s hand. At one small village, the local mayor arrived to greet the convoy.\n\nThe conversations, again, centered on the Russian threat.\n\n\u201cI hope that nothing like what happened in Ukraine or Crimea will happen here,\u201d said Leonard, 26, a Latvian agriculture worker who attended one of Monday\u2019s static displays. \u201cHere there are many people who think the Russian boys will be a little bit angry about the Americans being here. But I think it\u2019s good they are here. It makes me feel a little bit safer.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, Iron Troop entered Lithuania. Officials at the border distributed Lithuanian and U.S. flags to be tied on the radio antennas of the armored fighting vehicles. A short time later, the convoy entered the border town of Salociai, where, once dismounted, the Americans were asked to pose with Lithuanian soldiers while holding machine guns and flexing their biceps. Lithuanian students posed with a banner that read, \u201cTogether we can save our freedom.\u201d\n\nA speaker, whose words were relayed through an interpreter, spoke about the two countries\u2019 shared values and ability to \u201covercome any common enemy.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had freedom for more than two decades,\u201d the speaker said, \u201cand we\u2019re willing to fight to keep it.\u201d\n\nAs the convoy pulled out of town, women ran up and handed flowers to soldiers standing in gun turrets.\n\n\u201cThe reaction has been overwhelmingly positive,\u201d said Army Sgt. Garrick Jones, who has deployed to both Iraq and Afghanistan. \u201cIt was a lot more than I expected. It obviously means a lot to these people that we\u2019re here. And I\u2019m proud about that.\u201d\n\nThis is the first deployment for some of Iron Troop\u2019s younger soldiers. During down time, the more experienced troops shared stories with the younger ones about combat in Afghanistan and Iraq, recounting battles with the Taliban and al-Qaida, the focal enemies of U.S. armed forces for more than a decade.\n\nBut the olive green paint scheme on the Strykers, the cold Baltic forests, the thankful crowds on the road, the faces curiously poking out from behind lace curtains and the prolific relics of the Soviet Union portend a different type of war than most current U.S. soldiers expected to fight.\n\n\u201cWhen I was in ROTC we trained for mountain warfare,\u201d Lt. Keogh said. \u201cBut things have changed. Now we\u2019re talking about threats we haven\u2019t had to seriously consider dealing with for decades.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, the convoy will travel from Marijampole to Suwalki, Poland, passing within about 12 miles of the western Russian territory of Kaliningrad.\n\nLast week, Russia announced the deployment of Iskander missiles to Kalinigrad as part of snap military exercises. Iskander missiles are designed to carry both nuclear and conventional warheads and have a range of about 300 miles, which means the missiles in Kaliningrad could strike Poland, Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia.\n\n\u201cWe have to face reality,\u201d Viktor said as he waved his U.S. flag and gave a thumbs up to a passing Stryker. \u201cWe\u2019re only kidding ourselves and burying our heads in the sand if we think the Russian problem will solve itself.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Citizens of the three Baltic countries welcome U.S. support to defend the region from Russia.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Citizens of the three Baltic countries welcome U.S. support to defend the region from Russia.", "title": "Fearing Russia, Baltic Countries Welcome US Support", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/Baltic1.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-03-28T07:57:59+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1ECMeo0"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Citizens of the three Baltic countries welcome U.S. support to defend the region from Russia.", "title": "Fearing Russia, Baltic Countries Welcome US Support", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/Baltic1.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "International", "tag": "europe", "published_time": "2015-03-23T15:24:46+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-28T07:57:59+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Ukraine, cease-fire, Russia, Putin, Operation Atlantic Resolve, NATO, Dragoon Ride"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd35c9\"", "article_summary": "MARIJAMPOLE, Lithuania\u2014Citizens of the three Baltic countries have showed up in droves to welcome a U.S. Army Stryker convoy, which is traveling across Eastern Europe to underscore NATO\u2019s commitment to defend the region from Russia.\nAnd I\u2019m proud about that.\u201dThis is the first deployment for some of Iron Troop\u2019s younger soldiers.\nViktor, who held an American flag in his hand as he talked, said NATO should build a permanent base in one of the three Baltic countries to deter Russia.\n\u201cWe\u2019re only kidding ourselves and burying our heads in the sand if we think the Russian problem will solve itself.\u201d\n\u201cHere there are many people who think the Russian boys will be a little bit angry about the Americans being here."}
