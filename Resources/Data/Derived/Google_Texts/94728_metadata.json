As a result, a target has been slapped on Bill\u2019s back.\n\nDemocratic fundraising efforts claiming Bill is wealthy, with money to burn, and just another cookie-cutter Republican fooling Alaskans by running as an Independent paint a false portrait. Republican pollsters are also testing negative Walker messaging. Their questions suggest Walker would expand Obamacare and restrict gun rights. Voters were asked if they would vote for Walker if they knew he were an attorney, \u201cowned five houses,\u201d or quit as mayor after four months to take a higher-paying job. They claim Bill supported the Democratic gubernatorial candidate in 2010.\n\nBill came from humble honey-bucket, rural Alaska beginnings. He worked construction with his dad starting in his elementary years to keep food on the table. His family lost everything in the 1964 earthquake and at age 12, Bill became the post office janitor to help the family ward off bankruptcy. We both are among the first in our families to go to college and worked multiple jobs to put ourselves through school.\n\nBill was Mayor of Valdez when he was 27 years old. He served nearly two years before we left for law school. Since our first years of marriage, we started investing in real estate. We would borrow from my folks to buy a property for Bill to renovate, sell it, pay back my folks and make some profit. This is how we financed our law school education.\n\nWe have built a comfortable life the old-fashioned, hard-work way. We own the family home Bill built for us in 1994 and several properties built in the \u201960s and \u201970s that Bill renovated. We have tenants who have stayed with us for more than 30 years, which says a lot about Bill\u2019s personal and management skills. We do not have a government-funded or company-funded retirement plan or health insurance plan.\n\nBill does not have established political parties transferring tens of thousands of dollars to his campaign or party donor lists, as do his opponents. We are joining hundreds of Alaskans who have contributed to Bill by digging deep into our retirement funds to help fund campaign expenses. To us, this is an investment in Alaskans whom we hope through Bill\u2019s leadership will have the same opportunities we\u2019ve enjoyed.\n\nYes, we are attorneys who have primarily represented Alaska\u2019s municipalities. So is the incumbent governor, who primarily represented the oil industry in oil spill litigation and as a lobbyist. Bill is a lifetime NRA member and has never supported restrictions on gun rights. Refusing to accept the Medicaid expansion in essence expands Obamacare by forcing many Alaskans into the exchanges. Bill would accept the Medicaid expansion, with the caveat of continued federal funding, because Alaskans\u2019 federal tax dollars pay for it, thousands of Alaskans would be aided, and many new jobs would be created.\n\nGovernor Hickel in 2009 urged Bill to run for governor as an independent, but Bill ran as a Republican. Since then, Bill has grown increasingly dismayed at the partisan line-drawing stagnating our economic growth and polarizing Alaskans. While he is conservative, he does not engage in party activities and politics. His economic development strategies are not mandated by party platform. Running as an independent is a far more natural fit for Bill. He is, and forever will be, an Alaskan first.\n\nBill did not \u201csupport\u201d the Democratic nominee for governor in 2010. Ethan Berkowitz ran on an all-Alaska LNG export project platform while Parnell pushed the Canadian route. Bill specifically did not endorse Berkowitz but said he would accept a key energy adviser role Berkowitz offered. He did this after meeting with Parnell, who showed no interest in pursuing an LNG export project \u2014 which Bill has long advocated is key to Alaska\u2019s wellbeing and prosperity.\n\nBill is alarmed about the current $7 million per day spending deficit. His focus is to steer Alaska away from a looming economic cliff. When asked how he could accomplish things as an independent, Bill often says, \u201cIt\u2019s amazing what can get done when one does not care who gets the credit. I won\u2019t seek higher office, so I don\u2019t need the credit. I just want results.\u201d\n\nWhen Bill announced his candidacy in 2009, rather than address current issues, Republicans sent an investigator to Valdez to examine Bill\u2019s actions as mayor and councilmember in the 1970s. Parnell recently posted a distorted photo of Bill on Facebook. In that campaign and this, he will rarely face Bill in a debate.\n\nI personally like Bill\u2019s opponents and their spouses and find it unfortunate that their campaigns can\u2019t stick to the issues. No wonder good people decline to seek office. Thick skin, and for me, lots of prayers are required. Still, I wanted Bill\u2019s challengers to know that you are mischaracterizing a good man, and a truly great Alaskan.\n\n\u2022 Donna Walker is a mother, grandmother, attorney and business woman.
