That\u2019s the analysis by the National Priorities Project (NPP), not just Krugman, and they make an even more disturbing point.\n\nIn almost every one of these budget areas, nationwide polls show that a majority of Americans strongly oppose what the GOP is proposing. In other words, the Republicans are not delivering the kind of federal government that Americans want; they are declaring economic war on average Americans by reshaping government to serve the upper classes and biggest businesses.\n\nWhat follows is a summary of the NPP\u2019s analysis, with its documentation, showing that Repubicans are brazenly ignoring public opinion and national needs\u2014which isn\u2019t just anti-democratic but reveals how deeply corrupt the modern GOP has become.\n\n1. Bleed domestic programs to death.The budget is broken down into various areas that are reviewed separately, starting with domestic discretionary spending. This includes education, energy, environment, housing, job training and more. The White House wants modest increases in these areas in 2016. Polls show that Americans want more investment in infrastructure, climate change, the economy, immigration, and support higher tax revenues for these priorities. The GOP propose to freeze current spending or cut it back by hundreds of billions of dollars starting next fall, adding up to $5 trillion in cuts over the next decade.\n\n2. Who needs new or better jobs? Two-thirds of Americans say improving job prospects is a key issue facing Washington. Obama wants to spend about half a trillion dollars over the next six years on road and bridge upgrades, research and development, and give tax credits to new manufacturers. The House and Senate budgets propose \u201cno new funding\u201d in these areas, NPP said, with the Senate saying that \u201creduced spending and regulation will indirectly lead to job creation.\u201d\n\n3. Who needs a good education? The same-size majority that wants to see more and better jobs, also wants to see Congress improve access to education. The White House wants to expand federal subsidies from pre-school through high school, and spend $60 billion to provide two years of community college for free over the next decade. Republicans propose the opposite. The House wants to cap federal Pell grants, which are awarded to low-income people for college and graduate school. That means \u201cfinancial aid to fewer families,\u201d NPP said. It also wants \u201csubstantial cuts\u201d to discretionary education programs. The Senate is as bad. NPP said its budget has \u201cno new funding for education,\u201d and \u201cunspecified cuts to domestic discretionary spending could mean cuts to education.\u201d\n\n4. Who needs healthcare anyway?Obamacare may have its problems because it relies on private insurers to be middlemen, but since its inception11.7 million people have gained access to healthcare and millions have subsidized premiums. The Kaiser Family Foundation, which tracks healthcare trends, reports that 56 percent of Americans want Congress to expand, improve and implement the law. Obama wants \u201csmall tweaks\u201d in 2016, NPP said, whereas the House and Senate still obsess with repealing it entirely.\n\n5. Next on the chopping block: Social Security. Here, too, even cautious pollsters like the Pew Research Center, report that 66 percent of Americans want to strengthen the program\u2014which, contrary to GOP rhetoric, isn\u2019t an \u201centitlement,\u201d but the government acting as a retirement bank for decades of payroll deductions. Both chambers have already begun to attack a small part of Social Security that helps people with disabilties, saying they want to weed out fraud and cut payments. Meanwhile, the House wants a commission created to \u201cstudy the program\u2019s problems,\u201d as NPP put it. The GOP agenda is not expanding payments to make life easier, but cutting senior benefits while allowing young people to give their payroll deductions to Wall Street.\n\n6. Privatize Medicare, health care for seniors. Medicare is the federal government health plan for people age 65 and older. It is not free, but costs significantly less than private health insurance. Pew reported that 61 percent of Americans want this system fortified and improved. Obama wants to raise premiums for wealthy retirees, start co-payments for home health care, and allow the federal government to negotiate for lower drug costs, NPP said. The House GOP would also raise premiums for wealthier people, but starting in 2024 if would offer people a lump-sum payment to end their coverage, so they could theoretically buy private insurance. They also would ban the government from negotiating lower drug prices. Both of those proposals are giveaways that take money out of seniors\u2019 pockets and give it to corporations. The Senate GOP simply says it wants to cut about half a trillion dollars from Medicare over the next decade, but doesn\u2019t say how or where those cuts would be. That\u2019s pretending no one would be hurt.\n\n7. Kick 7 Million Poor People Off Medicaid. Medicaid is the state-run health program for low-income people. Under Obamacare, before the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that states don\u2019t have to implement this part of the law, the federal government planned to give every state grants to allow all poor people to get coverage through Medicaid. Even though almost all red states have not helped millions of residents this way, 7 million Americans have gotten access to health care through this Obamacare reform. Sixty-two percent of Americans believethat this Medicaid expansion should continue.\n\nThe White House wants to keep it that way and start a project where Medicaid recipients would be able to access new long-term care options, which comes into play when people no longer can take care of themselves. The House GOP doesn\u2019t just want to repeal Obamacare, kicking millions off this health plan, NPP reports, but it would cut overall Medicaid spending and turn the program\u2014along with SCHIP (the State Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program)\u2014into one block grant. That scenario all-but ensures that health care for poorer families will shrink. The Senate GOP, as with Medicare, says trillions must be cut, \u201cbut does not specify how,\u201d NPP reports.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Poll after poll shows Americans strongly oppose almost every facet of the new GOP budget proposal", "title": "14 ways Republicans have declared war on the middle class", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Poll after poll shows Americans strongly oppose almost every facet of the new GOP budget proposal", "title": "14 ways Republicans have declared war on the middle class", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/03/25/14_ways_republicans_have_declared_war_on_the_middle_class_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/11/paul_ryan7.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Poll after poll shows Americans strongly oppose almost every facet of the new GOP budget proposal", "title": "14 ways Republicans have declared war on the middle class", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/11/paul_ryan7.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Steven Rosenfeld", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, AlterNet, Income inequality, New York Times, Paul Krugman, Paul Ryan", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9c0a\"", "article_summary": "The Senate GOP, as with Medicare, says trillions must be cut, \u201cbut does not specify how,\u201d NPP reports.\nThe White House wants modest increases in these areas in 2016.\nThe House wants to cap federal Pell grants, which are awarded to low-income people for college and graduate school.\nMeanwhile, the House wants a commission created to \u201cstudy the program\u2019s problems,\u201d as NPP put it.\nThe House GOP would also raise premiums for wealthier people, but starting in 2024 if would offer people a lump-sum payment to end their coverage, so they could theoretically buy private insurance."}
