That's very clear. The question is, do we have the votes to pass a budget. And that's the conversation we're having with our members,\u201d Ryan said Tuesday during the GOP\u2019s weekly news conference, describing the talks as a \u201cfamily conversation.\u201d\n\nRelated: Why There\u2019s Trouble Ahead for Paul Ryan\u2019s Trillion-Dollar Budget\n\nThe admission is surprising given that the House Budget Committee, which Ryan once chaired, last week approved a resolution that provides $1.07 trillion in discretionary spending for fiscal 2017, sticking to the topline figure Congress and the White House agreed to in October.\n\nOnce a spending blueprint is out of committee, it usually receives a vote on the House floor the following week. What\u2019s making this year different is the insistence by the far-right House Freedom Caucus and others that GOP leaders tear up the bipartisan budget deal and cut $30 billion in spending.\n\nAnd there are enough votes between the group\u2019s 40-something members and other fiscal hawks to block the budget\u2019s passage, which would be a major embarrassment for Ryan.\n\nAs it is, the fervent opposition by the hardliners is seriously jeopardizing Ryan\u2019s push to meet the April 15 statutory deadline for the chamber to pass a budget. The window is already almost closed, what with lawmakers set to adjourn Wednesday for Easter recess and not return until April 12.\n\nRelated: Paul Ryan Is Taking a $30 Billion Gamble With the GOP\u2019s Budget\n\nIf Ryan can\u2019t convince hardliners to play ball, the possibility that leadership will move onto individual appropriations bills is increased. Worse, a catchall omnibus measure to fund the federal government, a reality even the Wisconsin lawmaker isn\u2019t ready to face, may never even be drafted.\n\n\u201cNo, we know we need to do a budget,\u201d he told reporters.\n\nRelated: Why the GOP\u2019s Budget Plans Are Going Off the Rails\n\n\u201cWe're still proceeding on that plan, hopefully getting a budget. But we're having that family conversation,\u201d according to Ryan. \u201cBut what we did not want to do is slow the appropriators down for the spadework that they have to do at the committee level. But right now, we're still having that family conversation with our members about how to proceed with the budget.\u201d\n\nHowever, when pressed if the GOP spending guide would be teed up in mid-April, he replied: \u201cI don\u2019t know the answer to that.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Democrats are using the weeks of delay to chastise Ryan and his fellow Republicans.\n\n\u201cIt is simply unconscionable that the House Republican Leadership plans two weeks of recess without \u2026 passing a budget blueprint for next year,\u201d House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) said in a statement on Monday.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Months after House Republicans began talking about passing a federal budget for 2017, Speaker Paul Ryan (WI) confirmed lawmakers are still doing just that: talking.", "title": "The GOP Budget Is on Life Support, and Paul Ryan Knows It", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/03/23/GOP-Budget-Life-Support-and-Paul-Ryan-Knows-It", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-congress-ryan_6.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/03/23/GOP-Budget-Life-Support-and-Paul-Ryan-Knows-It", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-congress-ryan_6.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Months after House Republicans began talking about passing a federal budget for 2017, Speaker Paul Ryan (WI) confirmed lawmakers are still doing just that: talking.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Related: Why the GOP\u2019s Budget Plans Are Going Off the Rails\u201cWe're still proceeding on that plan, hopefully getting a budget.\nMonths after House Republicans began talking about passing a federal budget for 2017, Speaker Paul Ryan (WI) confirmed lawmakers are still doing just that: talking.\nRelated: Paul Ryan Is Taking a $30 Billion Gamble With the GOP\u2019s BudgetIf Ryan can\u2019t convince hardliners to play ball, the possibility that leadership will move onto individual appropriations bills is increased.\nBut we're having that family conversation,\u201d according to Ryan.\nOnce a spending blueprint is out of committee, it usually receives a vote on the House floor the following week."}
