WHO's 2005 multi-country survey revealed up to 56 percent of women had been subjected to IPV \u2014 that\u2019s physical, sexual, and/or emotional abuse, as well as a partner\u2019s controling behavior. In the United States, the American Psychological Association revealed one in three women have reported experiencing rape, physical violence, and/or have been stalked by an intimate partner in their lifetime. One of the many problems with IPV is that it\u2019s associated with poor reproductive health, meaning women are more likely to be subjected to reproductive coercion (being forced to either get pregnant or have an abortion) and contraception sabotage (a partner works to purposefully get a woman pregnant). And now, new research published in PLOS Medicine has found it\u2019s not enough to simply identify these women, but rather, the specific behaviors that reduce the control women, of all ages, have over their own bodies, too.\n\nReduced control stems from the lack of training some health care providers have when it comes to providing women with the education and assistance they need to develop a family plan, researchers wrote. This conversation helps a woman identify the timing, number, and spacing of her future pregnancies, should pregnancy be a goal of hers at all. In which case, if she does not want to get pregnant, her health care provider should also be able to help her navigate that conversation with a partner who does want children, lessening the risk of reproductive coercion.\n\nSimilarly, women who don\u2019t have a wide-range of, let alone access to, female-controlled contraception \u2014 oral contraceptives, like birth control, intrauterine devices, and contraceptive patches \u2014 are twice as likely to report unintended pregnancy. This seems like it shouldn\u2019t be an issue, especially since The Affordable Care Act makes it so millions of people can have access to birth control and other preventative services without co-pays or deductibles. However, the law currently applies to those with private health insurance. That means free clinics, like Planned Parenthood, are a leading source for women to get the help they need.\n\nAgain, this is a seemingly non-issue\u2026 until you skim over the many headlines that discuss the 12 NFL players still playing after domestic violence arrests, the proposed closings of several abortion clinics, the so-called Hobby Lobby decision that for-real ruled religious corporation owners are not required to cover their employee\u2019s insurance for contraception, and of course, the way a woman\u2019s body can magically prevent a \u201clegitimate rape\u201d from resulting in pregnancy. In Bad Feminist, Roxanne Gay, New York Times best-selling author and English professor at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Ind., said despite \u201cpoliticians and their ilk who are hell-bent on reintroducing reproductive freedom as a \u2018campaign issue\u2019 have short memories,\u201d women, thankfully, do not. She added:\n\nRather than solve the real problems the United States is facing, some politicians, mostly conservative, have decided to try to solve the \u2018female problem\u2019 by creating a smoke screen, reintroducing abortion and, more inexplicably, birth control into a national debate. Women have been forced undergrounded for contraception and pregnancy termination before, and we will go underground again if we have to.\n\nWhen abusive partners (and legislation?) reduce the control a woman has over her body, forcing her to get pregnant and potentially threatening her life, these women are twice as likely to get an abortion by, as Gay touched upon, any means necessary. Thus, researchers wrote, \u201cIPV places women at greater risk of maternal death by increasing their risk for unsafe abortion.\u201d Even with access to female-controled contraception, abusive partners are prone to hiding and destroying it.\n\nThe only way researchers propose any of this will improve is if everyone \u2014 we\u2019re paraphrasing here \u2014 gets a grip. \u201cAddressing the range of poor reproductive outcomes associated with IPV and related non-violent forms of male reproductive coercion will require development of interventions and policies multiple levels, [like the national health care system, clinics, communities, families, and relationships] adapted to multiple cultural and geographic contexts.\u201d These \u201cbrief and sustainable service-based\u201d interventions will both educate women on IPV, but will alert them to potential warning signs.\n\nAnd there are warning signs. A separate study from the University of Michigan Health System not only found one in five men have committed IPV, making it more prevalent than diabetes, but most doctors can pick-up on particularly aggressive behavior. \u201cMost of our efforts to prevent intimate partner violence have focused on screening and improving outcomes for women who are victims, because their health and well-being is our priority,\u201d Dr. Vijay Singh, a clinical lecturer in the Departments of Emergency Medicine and Family Medicine at the University of Michigan Medical School, said in a press release. \u201cOur research shows that male perpetrators of intimate partner violence seek routine medical services, and they have physical symptoms that are common reasons patients seek medical care. This suggests that we may be missing an important opportunity in the primary care setting to identify their aggressive behavior and potentially intervene.\u201d\n\nChanging the way we talk about something as little as bith control pills can have a big impact on the way we talk about, and address the too-many issues concerning, reproductive health.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "birth, control, discussions, can, lead, partner, violence, argument, intervention, programs", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Intimate partner violence is now more prevalent than diabetes.", "title": "The Birth Control Conversation Needs An Intervention", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/birth-control-discussions-can-lead-partner-violence-argument-intervention-programs-303540", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/17/stop-sign.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Intimate partner violence is now more prevalent than diabetes.", "title": "The Birth Control Conversation Needs An Intervention", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/birth-control-discussions-can-lead-partner-violence-argument-intervention-programs-303540", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/17/stop-sign.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/17/stop-sign.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Conditions", "published_time": "2014-09-17T12:10:51-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-09-17T12:36:24-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Intimate partner violence is now more prevalent than diabetes."}, "article_summary": "Intimate partner violence (IPV), as founded by the World Health Organization, is widespread in every country.\n\u201cOur research shows that male perpetrators of intimate partner violence seek routine medical services, and they have physical symptoms that are common reasons patients seek medical care.\nAnd now, new research published in PLOS Medicine has found it\u2019s not enough to simply identify these women, but rather, the specific behaviors that reduce the control women, of all ages, have over their own bodies, too.\nIn the United States, the American Psychological Association revealed one in three women have reported experiencing rape, physical violence, and/or have been stalked by an intimate partner in their lifetime.\nReduced control stems from the lack of training some health care providers have when it comes to providing women with the education and assistance they need to develop a family plan, researchers wrote."}
