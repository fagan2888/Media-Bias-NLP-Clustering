That\u2019s for sure,\u201d reads the pithy Eileen Myles epigram that launches \u201cGrandma,\u201d Paul Weitz\u2019s latest feature. Based on typical Hollywood fare, it could be hard to tell; unless one happens to be Meryl Streep or Richard Gere, life ends after 60, and if you happen to lack a Y chromosome it would seem to stop at least a decade earlier.\n\nBut some of this might be changing. \u201cGrandma,\u201d starring Lily Tomlin, 75, and Nancy Meyers\u2019 \u201cThe Intern,\u201d with Robert De Niro, 72, are making serious box office buck, drawing in audiences a third their age. Even odder is that neither film pivots around the trials of getting older or the fruits of late coupledom\u2014rather, both focus on the relationships between those of a certain age and those considerably younger, part of a handful of recent movies eschewing traditional plots to tackle the tensions between traditionalists, baby boomers, Generations X, Y and Z.\n\nWhy the shift? Perhaps the fact that now more than ever we are likely to have to deal with those much older and younger than ourselves. Partly due to rising longevity and falling retirement rates, in 2015, for the first time in history, all five generations could potentially share a workspace. For those of Generations X, Y and Z, delayed marriage and childbearing means that it\u2019s not uncommon for a single 32-year-old to socialize with those five to 10 years older, to compete for internships with applicants fresh out of college. We are entering an age of the pan-generational mashup, and we need to learn how to listen.\n\nWidely lauded for cynical character-driven dramas (\u201cThe Squid and the Whale,\u201d \u201cGreenberg\u201d), Noah Baumbach released two films in 2015 that seem cheery by comparison, both inviting anyone under 50 to sort out what they have in common. In \u201cWhile We\u2019re Young,\u201d Gen Xers Josh and Cornelia\u2014played by Ben Stiller, 49, and Naomi Watts, 47\u2014befriend millennial hipster couple Jamie and Darby, played by Adam Driver, 31, and Amanda Seyfried, 29. All childless, the four bike across Brooklyn, frequent bougie artisanal restaurants and puke into shared ayahuasca buckets. This cozy cultural crochet joining X and Y eventually unravels\u2014Jamie and Darby aren\u2019t nearly as earnest or ebullient as they seemed, and Josh and Cornelia ultimately opt to become parents\u2014but both couples plainly gain more than they lose in the process.\n\n\u201cMistress America,\u201d Baumbach\u2019s late summer comedy, studies the bond between 30-year old Brooke, played by the unsinkable Greta Gerwig, and Tracy, her soon-to-be stepsister, a college first-year played by Lola Kirke. Brooke and Tracy go dancing, attend spinning class, visit bars that proffer complimentary hot dogs. The climax of the film follows a road trip from Manhattan to suburban Connecticut to beg Brooke\u2019s married ex-fianc\u00e9 (an amusing Michael Chernus) for a serious loan. In a hatchback packed with college kids and one feckless millennial, the transition from youthful insouciance to settled-down banality couldn\u2019t be more explicit. Inevitably, Brooke and Lola \u201cbreak up\u201d as friends, and just as inevitably, they get back together, in the film\u2019s final scene sharing Thanksgiving dinner in an East Village diner. Tracy boosts Brooke\u2019s flagging confidence as a dreamer who hasn\u2019t gotten her start yet, and Brooke grants self-conscious Tracy a sense of her own distinct appeal. As said in one of the film\u2019s most memorable voice-overs, \u201cHer beauty was that rare kind that made you want to look more like yourself and not like her.\u201d\n\n\u201cGrandma\u201d and \u201cThe Intern\u201d feature an even broader age range\u2014from 5 to 75\u2014poking holes in presumptions of what it means to get old, feel young or (not so) simply grow up. In \u201cGrandma,\u201d a kind of \u201cevery-wave\u201d feminism unites Elle, an unorthodox matriarch played by Tomlin, her daughter Judy (Marcia Gay Harden), and teenage granddaughter Sage (Julia Garner) when facing an unplanned pregnancy. As Ben, \u201csenior intern\u201d to CEO Jules, played by Anne Hathaway, De Niro becomes a grandfatherly confidant\u2014to his boss, office colleagues and practically everyone else with whom he comes into contact. Though differing markedly in tone, style and budget, both films suggest that getting older can lead to a sense of fearlessness and resilience that the young are missing out on.\n\nMany have dubbed \u201cGrandma\u201d another \u201cabortion film,\u201d in the spirit of \u201cObvious Child,\u201d but the film\u2019s real focus is on the clashes between the generations already born and blundering. \u201cThe gravity of the choice doesn\u2019t elude us,\u201d said Tomlin in an interview at the Sundance Film Festival\u2014and in this film the gravity of the choice brings three generations of women together, quite literally, in a clinic waiting room. At the film\u2019s start, Elle has just broken up with her much younger girlfriend Olivia (played by a very believable Judy Greer), and is soon after visited by her panicked granddaughter. The drama unfolds over the course of a single day, and throughout Tomlin wears her own clothing and drives her own 1955 Dodge Royal Lancer. It\u2019s not surprising that Weitz wrote the role with only Tomlin in mind.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Four recent films show how young, old and in-between might not get each other, but need each other more than ever", "title": "So wait, millennials aren\u2019t the enemy?
