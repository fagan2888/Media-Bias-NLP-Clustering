The government spent about $634 million on creating healthcare.gov; what did they do with all that money? Well, they created a huge mess. They contracted five different people who apparently built their portions while “hiding in silos” and never communicating with each other and they built it on 10+ year-old software.

Seton Motley, founder and president of Less Government joins The Heartland Institute to discuss the horrific technical problems of the Obamacare rollout.

Facebook is 9 years old! The first Pirates of the Caribbean came out around the same time that the software for healthcare.gov came out… Come on! So, how did they spend so much money and still not deliver? Well, Motley offers up the “wallet rule” as explanation — if you went out on a Friday night with your own wallet, but went out on a Saturday night with someone else’s wallet, which night do you think you’d have more fun on?

The point is, when you spend other people’s money, you are less frugal, and you care less about the results. And that is what happened to healthcare.gov, and what government almost always does!

When asked if the website would ever catch up and work how it’s supposed to work- Motley is not optimistic. He predicts that if the British government can’t pull it off in 9 years and $15 billion, then neither can we.
