I never thought I\u2019d see the day that I\u2019d praise an insurance company. But the proverbial Atlas just shrugged.\n\nInsurance company pharmacy benefit managers, who have apparently had it with drug companies charging American consumers ridiculously high, and ever-increasing, prices for prescription drugs, are starting to say \u201cenough.\u201d\n\nAt the top of the list is my asthma drug, Advair.\n\nSome big insurance company pharmacy benefits managers are simply no longer permitting their plans to cover Advair. Or at best, they\u2019ve relegated Advair to the lower \u201cthird tier,\u201d which means the patient has to pay so much of the price that they simply won\u2019t buy the drug at all.\n\nAs a result, Advair sales plummeted 30% this year in the US.\n\nGlaxoSmithKline charges Americans 5x what it charges Europeans for Advair\n\nAdvair\u2019s parent company, GlaxoSmithKline, charges Americans five times the price it charges many Europeans for the same drug.\n\nYes, five times.\n\nFor example, in France I bought a one month\u2019s supply of Advair 100/50 last summer for around 38 euros, or around $52 dollars. The same drug in the states will set you back $254, and that\u2019s at Costco. You\u2019ll pay more elsewhere.\n\nOh, and it gets even better. In the past few years, Advair\u2019s parent company, GlaxoSmithKline, raised the price 30% in the US over the past few years, while they lowered the price 10% in France over the same time period. So over the past 5 years, Advair went from being 3x as expensive in the US as it is in Europe, to 5x as expensive.\n\nAnd before you think that France is somehow subsidizing the purchase, they\u2019re not. France simply negotiated with GlaxoSmithKline, and the company agreed to charge the French FIVE TIMES LESS THAN IT CHARGES AMERICANS.\n\nThink about that for a moment. You\u2019re paying five times the price for an obscenely expensive prescription drug because of your citizenship.\n\nOh but it\u2019s worse than that, the NYT confirms that the reason Americans are paying so much is because the drug companies want us to make up the difference for the deal they give Europeans.\n\nMany other countries control drug prices in some manner, so drug companies have become dependent on increasing prices in the United States to grow.\n\nI was pretty ticked that under the new Obamacare plans, I\u2019d still pay far too much for my Advair. But I\u2019ve kind of had it with companies like GlaxoSmithKline, who are basically fleecing American consumers because of our citizenship, and so that they can subsidize Europeans. I love Europe, I may even retire in Europe, but it\u2019s hard enough for me to pay my bills each month, let alone help some guy in Paris pay his as well.\n\nDemocrats and Republicans are both to blame\n\nOur entire health care system is a mess. It\u2019s bought by and owned by huge companies, like the drug companies. And even under Obamacare, Congress refused to lift the laws that help drug companies maintain their obscene prices. For example, did you know that it\u2019s illegal for the Medicare program to negotiate prescription drug prices with Big Pharma?\n\nYes, they made it illegal for the United States government to practice capitalism and simply negotiate with drug companies to try to get a better deal. And sadly, Obamacare did nothing to change it. And it\u2019s not just the Democrats\u2019 fault \u2014 both parties are owned by Big Pharma and big healthcare.\n\nOf course, it doesn\u2019t help when the FDA posts Big Pharma false propaganda on the FDA.gov Web site. Which brings us to another thing illegal under US law \u2014 bringing back more than a few month\u2019s worth of drugs with you from Europe. Why? Because the FDA says that no one knows if the drugs are even safe!\n\nYes, GlaxoSmithKline sells Advair for 1/5 the price in Paris, and if you try to bring that Advair home with you, and Customs finds it, it will be confiscated \u201cfor your own protection.\u201d Because, apparently GlaxoSmithKline is such a dangerous company that we can\u2019t trust the drugs they manufacture in Europe, but they\u2019re such a great company that we can trust the drugs they manufacture in America, and pay five times the price for them!\n\nThe word \u201cobscene\u201d doesn\u2019t begin to describe what GlaxoSmithKline, and far too many other pharmaceutical companies, are doing to American consumers.\n\nSo, while I\u2019ve found that Advair is the drug that works best on my asthma, I\u2019m willing to see the drug virtually banned in America. I hope GlaxoSmithKline goes down in flames.\n\nNow a word about Symbicort and AstraZeneca\n\nOne more thing. As you read the NYT article, don\u2019t be fooled by the part that talks about how good GlaxoSmithKline\u2019s competitor, AstraZeneca, is with its Advair competition drug Symbicort. And how insurance companies, and consumers, are flocking to Symbicort because it\u2019s a more reasonably priced drug.\n\nIt\u2019s not.\n\nI\u2019ve written about Symbicort before. They\u2019re almost as bad as Glaxo.\n\nFor example, two years ago I went to a French pharmacy to buy some Symbicort, and it cost me 54 euros, or 66 dollars at the time.\n\nGuess how much AstraZeneca was charging for Symbicort in America?\n\n$233, or 3.5x the price of what AstraZeneca charges the French.\n\nSo, if American insurance companies are boycotting Advair, someone needs to ask them why they\u2019re not boycotting Symbicort as well.\n\nOur system is a colossal mess.\n\nFollow @aravosis\n\nNOTE FROM JOHN: We need your help sharing our content on social media \u2014 most folks think it doesn\u2019t matter, but it\u2019s the difference between keeping the site alive or not.
