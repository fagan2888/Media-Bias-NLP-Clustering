Right now, he says the taxpayer has funded the state's exchanges.\n\nNow, if an exchange does fail, his legislation would require unused funds be returned to the treasury department to work down the national debt. This includes funds and equipment used to run the exchanges.\n\nAllen says states should be keeping records and properly reporting how these federal funds have been spent.\n\n\"Forty-nine its all about accountability, basically an audit process. We want to go back into the states and if there's any money left we want to bring back that money to reduce our debt\", said Rick Allen.\n\nWe reached out to the department of health and human services multiple times for an interview but were not granted one. In a statement they say: 20 million people have gained health insurance coverage because of the Affordable Care Act and the uninsured rate has fallen to the lowest on record. Unfortunately, partisan efforts in the house of representatives to repeal key parts of the ACA do the opposite.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "It's been nearly six years of turmoil in Washington over the Affordable Care Act and now with some state exchanges closing down around the country, Republician members of Congress highlighting flaws in the cleanup.", "language": "english", "author": "Roger Uvalle", "og": {"description": "It's been nearly six years of turmoil in Washington over the Affordable Care Act and now with some state exchanges closing down around the country, Republician members of Congress highlighting flaws in the cleanup.", "title": "Recouping Obamacare funds", "url": "http://www.kgns.tv/home/headlines/Recouping-Obamacare-372040742.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/603/2F1/6032F1611DBF4E2CAAEBAF3C7637371C", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/696/598/69659862C49E4ABF9CDE300B106227E6.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kgns.tv", "description": "It's been nearly six years of turmoil in Washington over the Affordable Care Act and now with some state exchanges closing down around the country, Republician members of Congress highlighting flaws in the cleanup.", "title": "Recouping Obamacare funds", "url": "http://www.kgns.tv/home/headlines/Recouping-Obamacare-372040742.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/Obamacare51.jpg", "creator": "@KGNSnews", "site": "@KGNSnews", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Recouping Obamacare funds", "google-site-verification": "DygmeezGE4ialN3nXb6qwRPx93JkkfnyBcfO0XvkUjg", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The House of Representatives continue to look at ways to repeal the Affordable Care Act.\nIn a statement they say: 20 million people have gained health insurance coverage because of the Affordable Care Act and the uninsured rate has fallen to the lowest on record.\nAllen says states should be keeping records and properly reporting how these federal funds have been spent.\nNow, if an exchange does fail, his legislation would require unused funds be returned to the treasury department to work down the national debt.\nUnfortunately, partisan efforts in the house of representatives to repeal key parts of the ACA do the opposite."}
