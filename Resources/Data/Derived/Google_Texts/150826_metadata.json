At least not Sunday after the Avalanche\u2019s ugly loss to Anaheim at home \u2014 in which the Ducks ran right over Colorado in the second period.\n\nWith the game tied 2-2, Anaheim\u2019s Cam Fowler corralled the puck on the left boards and he made a move toward the front of the net. At first, he hesitated \u2014 because there\u2019s no way he should be allowed to skate so freely near a team\u2019s goal. But Fowler, almost surprised by the lack of defense, cruised right in for the game-winner.\n\nHe skated right through the circle with three Avs defenders nearby, including veteran forward Jarome Iginla.\n\n\u201cOn that third goal, we were just lost,\u201d Roy said. \u201cJarome lost his position, lost his D. And it was an easy walk-in for Fowler.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t exactly a tongue-lashing from Roy. And Colorado\u2019s coach didn\u2019t put the whole loss on Iginla \u2014 it was an ugly second period top-to-bottom for the Avs, in which they got off just two(!) shots, including one from just inside the red line by Dennis Everberg with seconds left.\n\nBut Iginla\u2019s name was the only one mentioned by Roy in describing Fowler\u2019s game-winner.\n\nSpeaking on the Avs\u2019 loss and the rough second period, Matt Duchene said:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s tough to put a finger on what happened.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s the Fowler goal:", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Jarome Iginla,Matt Duchene,Patrick Roy", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"site_name": "All Things Avalanche", "description": "Patrick Roy isn't handing out veteran favors to Jarome Iginla.
