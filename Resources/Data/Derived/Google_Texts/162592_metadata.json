We\u2019ve seen very heavy usage, particularly when it got up close to the cut-off periods, as you would guess,\u201d Earley said of traffic at www.healthcare.gov.\n\nFor coverage to begin on Jan. 1, enrollments had to be completed by Dec. 15. The numbers from Highmark reflected enrollments up until Dec. 31.\n\nIt was not immediately clear exactly how many of those enrolled were new health insurance enrollees.\n\nThose who have that coverage, though, are paying higher premiums \u2014 estimated at less than ten percent higher than 2014 rates, according to Earley.\n\n\u201cIt was not one that we felt was clearly unwarranted,\u201d he said in defense of the rate hike. \u201cIt did fit the market.\u201d\n\nWhile marketplaces in other states include competition, Earley\u2019s company is still the only company offering healthcare plans on West Virginia\u2019s exchange, the marketplace for people who don\u2019t have other insurance options like employer-sponsored programs or who are not eligible for Medicaid.\n\nKentucky Health Cooperative delayed entering West Virginia\u2019s health insurance marketplace until later this year after initially planning to begin offering health insurance plans in the Mountain State last November alongside Highmark.\n\n\u201cWhen we set the rates, we did so with an eye toward having competition in the market,\u201d Earley said of the rates that were filed last spring. \u201cI would put forth the position that they are competitive rates because that\u2019s how they were modeled.\u201d\n\nEarley was a guest on Monday\u2019s MetroNews \u201cTalkline.\u201d\n\nThe deadline for enrollment for health insurance without penalty is Feb. 15.\n\nFor 2015, the penalty for not having health insurance after that date has grown to 2 percent of yearly household income with the maximum being the national average premium for a bronze plan in the healthcare exchange or $325 per person for the year, $162.50 per child under the age of 18, up to a $975 maximum per family.", "article_metadata": {"description": "More than 31,100 people have enrolled, so far, either on West Virginia's federal exchange or directly with the company for 2015.", "og": {"site_name": "WV MetroNews", "description": "More than 31,100 people have enrolled, so far, either on West Virginia\u2019s federal exchange or directly with the company for 2015.", "title": "Highmark president says premium rates for 2015 are competitive", "url": "http://wvmetronews.com/2015/01/12/highmark-president-says-premium-rates-for-2015-are-competitive/", "image": {"width": 300, "identifier": "http://wvmetronews.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Health-Insurance.jpg", "height": 250}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://wvmetronews.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Health-Insurance.jpg?w=640", "site": "@wvmetronews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 439959236158130, "pages": 327490709044}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-01-12T17:04:12+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-12T17:04:12+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Kentucky Health Cooperative delayed entering West Virginia\u2019s health insurance marketplace until later this year after initially planning to begin offering health insurance plans in the Mountain State last November alongside Highmark.\nIt was not immediately clear exactly how many of those enrolled were new health insurance enrollees.\n\u201cI would put forth the position that they are competitive rates because that\u2019s how they were modeled.\u201dEarley was a guest on Monday\u2019s MetroNews \u201cTalkline.\u201dThe deadline for enrollment for health insurance without penalty is Feb. 15.\nDuring the second year of exchange enrollment, Fred Earley, president of Highmark Blue Cross Blue Shield West Virginia, reported the process went much smoother than the bungled launch at the close of 2013.\nThose who have that coverage, though, are paying higher premiums \u2014 estimated at less than ten percent higher than 2014 rates, according to Earley."}
