Right out of the gate, Rand Paul is selling no shortage of gear on RandPaul.com to help raise funds, and on Sunday, he released a new item in his store: “Hillary’s hard drive.”

But you better hurry, it’s a limited edition, with only 80 available. It’ll set you back $99.95.

From the “quick overview”:

“You’ve read about it on the news, now you can get one for yourself. Hillary’s Hard Drive. 100% genuine erased clean email server. Buyer beware, this product has had heavy use and it currently is no longer working, but that doesn’t mean its not valuable to someone. Anyone? “

Selling a fake Clinton email server isn’t exactly a new idea. In March, one of Clinton’s neighbors trolled her with a for sale sign on ‘clean hard drive’ in their driveway.

Paul also is selling a “Liberty Not Hillary” eye chart, that reads at the bottom “hindsight is 20/20.”

While he has some strange items up for sale, the “Giant Rand Paul Birthday Card” has to be the strangest.
