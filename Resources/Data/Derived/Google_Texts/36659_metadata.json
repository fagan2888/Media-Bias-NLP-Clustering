He said the overlap between the two gives students a more holistic approach to public health education.\n\n\u201cWe got divorced back then, and we\u2019re now getting remarried,\u201d Ku said about the departments\u2019 separation 15 years ago. \u201cBeing in D.C., there\u2019s such a focus on policy and we\u2019ve established that focus now.\u201d\n\nHe added that recent legislation creates more jobs and opportunities that require students to be experienced in both fields.\n\n\u201cThe worlds are colliding with things like the Affordable Care Act, so managers need to understand how policy is changing,\" Ku said. \u201cOverall, there\u2019s a great overlap in subject matter, and we were the only equivalent programs in the country that were still separate.\"\n\nThe combined department of health policy allows students seeking their master's or doctoral degrees in public health to take classes in both public health and management, while still concentrating their degree in one of the two options.\n\nBy combining two graduate programs into one comprehensive department, the public health school is falling in line with other combined programs at public health schools across the country.\n\nThe University of California, Berkeley has a similar combined program in its school of public health and offers other combined degrees across schools, said Joan Bloom, a professor in the school. She said the program\u2019s graduates often enter careers that are overall more policy-oriented than administrative.\n\n\u201cStudents are less restricted, and there are sufficient electives and opportunities for internships that they focus the program the way they want it,\u201d Bloom said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://www.gwhatchet.com/wp-content/themes/hatchet/images/meta-image.jpg"}, "verify-v1": "+A6DAyBir9IsXPW3vn8nCeXhms39MOuMd6gezt5O05w=", "twitter": {"description": "The departments joined this semester in a move that will help faculty across the similar fields collaborate more on research and will also likely help the graduate students in those programs better prepare for work in health administration.", "title": "Public health school combines policy and management departments - The GW Hatchet", "url": "http://www.gwhatchet.com/2015/04/23/public-health-school-combines-policy-and-management-departments/", "image": "http://www.gwhatchet.com/files/2015/04/Milken_SG-300x200.jpg", "site": "@gwhatchet", "card": "summary"}, "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc1c2\"", "article_summary": "Public health school combines policy and management departments by Ellie Smith | Contributing News EditorMedia Credit: Sara Gleysteen | Hatchet PhotographerPublic health policy and management just got remarried.\nLynn Goldman, the dean of the Milken Institute School of Public Health, said the merger will optimize research opportunities and classroom education for all public health graduate students.\nBy combining two graduate programs into one comprehensive department, the public health school is falling in line with other combined programs at public health schools across the country.\nThe combined department of health policy allows students seeking their master's or doctoral degrees in public health to take classes in both public health and management, while still concentrating their degree in one of the two options.\n\u201cTomorrow\u2019s public health leaders deserve and need the best education and training possible,\u201d Goldman said in an email."}
