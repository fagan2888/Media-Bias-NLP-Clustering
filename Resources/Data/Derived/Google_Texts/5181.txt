One of the built-in benefits of producing anti-Obamacare attack ads is that you can insulate them from scrutiny by attacking anyone who questions the presented facts for insulting a sick person or an ACA victim.

That kind of argumentum ad hominem doesn’t really surprise me coming from the political operatives who make the ads (though it’s worth noting that not all flacks resort to the same tactic).

But it’s not just coming from them. It’s also coming from some conservative journalists, who apparently believe their vocation involves abetting dishonest pressure groups.

Welcome back to the hack gap.

The article linked in the above tweet admittedly does not argue for impunity as explicitly as its headline does. But it rationalizes a lower standard of scrutiny for political attack ads by directing a tu quoque critique at journalists whom they deem insufficiently critical of President Obama. By that standard, this article should never have been written.

There’s also this kind of abetting.
