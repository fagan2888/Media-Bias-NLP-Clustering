DU (13-8-5, 7-5-2) and North Dakota (13-8-3, 8-6) are tied for first place in the first-year conference with 24 points, one more than St. Cloud State, which has two games in hand.\n\n\u201cWe love coaching this group because they\u2019re resilient. Their nickname should be \u2018scrappy,\u2019 \u201d said first-year DU coach Jim Montgomery, whose team is idle next weekend before visiting St. Cloud State on Feb. 7-8. \u201cWe just keep finding ways to get better. Good things will continue to happen the rest of the year.\u201d\n\nFreshman Emig Romig and junior Zac Larraza (two) scored DU\u2019s goals and Brittain made 43 saves to avenge Friday\u2019s 4-2 loss to the team formerly nicknamed the Fighting Sioux.\n\nBefore scoring on an empty net with two seconds remaining, tri-captain Larraza gave DU a two-goal cushion 1:07 into the third period \u2014 after North Dakota freshman Luke Johnson took an elbowing minor 14 seconds into the frame.\n\nDU freshman Trevor Moore one-timed a feed from classmate Will Butcher and the puck slithered past UND goalie Clarke Saunders and just inside the goal line, where Larraza tapped it in for the game\u2019s only power-play goal.\n\nButcher, a defenseman who was selected by the Avalanche in the fourth round of the 2013 NHL draft, also assisted on DU\u2019s first goal.\n\nThat was an all-freshman effort. Romig, a winger, put in a wrister through traffic after taking a drop pass from center Evan Janssen inside the UND blue line. Butcher moved the puck up the ice to Janssen.\n\nBoth teams went on the power play twice after that to end the second period, but the tight-checking play continued and the senior goaltenders were strong.\n\nNorth Dakota won Friday at Magness Arena behind two power-play goals and a short-handed tally. Montgomery demanded a more inspired effort from DU stemming from emotion \u2014 and he certainly got it.\n\n\u201cWe came out with a lot of energy and emotion, and when you\u2019re doing that, you\u2019re first on pucks, moving quicker because you\u2019re mentally sharp,\u201d he said.\n\nDU didn\u2019t give UND much. And when Brittain was tested, he had defenders cleaning up rebounds.\n\nDU also was much better with and without the puck in the neutral zone.\n\nMike Chambers: mchambers@ denverpost.com or twitter.com/mchambers\n\nDU Recap\n\nThe Post\u2019s three stars\n\n1. Sam Brittain. Senior goalie had 43 saves for the Pioneers.\n\n2. Zac Larraza. DU tri-captain and junior wing had two third-period goals.\n\n3. Will Butcher. Freshman defenseman and Avalanche prospect had two assists.\n\nWhat you might have missed\n\nMembers of DU\u2019s 2004 NCAA championship team took a ceremonial pregame puck drop. It\u2019s been 10 years since the Pioneers\u2019 magical postseason run culminated in a 1-0 victory over Maine in Boston.\n\nUp next\n\nAt St. Cloud State, Friday, Feb. 7\n\nMike Chambers, The Denver Post\n\nNorth Dakota 000 \u2014 0 Denver 012 \u20143\n\nFirst period \u2014 None.
