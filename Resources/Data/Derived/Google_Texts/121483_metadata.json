Around 30 percent are living with their parents, and many others are coping with stagnant wages, underemployment, and sky-high rent. And then there are those who are doing just great\u2014owning a house, buying a car, and consistently putting money away for retirement. These, however, are not your run-of-the-mill Millennials. Nope. These Millennials have something very special: rich parents. These Millennials have help paying their tuition, meaning they graduate in much better financial shape than their peers who have to self-finance college through a mix of jobs, scholarships, and loans. And then, for the very luckiest, they\u2019ll also get some help with a down payment, making homeownership possible, while it remains mostly unattainable for the vast majority of young adults. To start with, most of those who continue their education after high school have families that are able to help financially. A recent report from the real-estate research company Zillow looked at Federal Reserve Board data on young adults aged 23-34 and found that of the 46 percent of Millennials who pursued post-secondary education (that\u2019s everything from associates degrees to doctorates), about 61 percent received some financial help with their educational expenses from their parents.\n\nAnd yet, even with this help, the average student with loans at a four-year college graduates with about $26,000 in student-loan debt. Millennials who are lucky enough to have some, or all, of a college tuition\u2019s burden reduced by their parents have a leg up on peers who are saddled with student debt, and they\u2019ll be able to more quickly move out on their own, and maybe even buy their own house.

But first-time buyers\u2014a group generally made up of younger adults\u2014have been scarce since the recession. And research indicates it\u2019s not because many of them want to remain renters, but because they just simply can\u2019t save up enough for a down payment, especially not the down payments needed in the expensive urban markets where so many Millennials prefer to live. According to Svenja Gudell, the senior director of economic research at Zillow, \u201cThere\u2019s a ton of people out there who want to buy. In our most recent survey in the beginning of the year, we had 5.3 million renters interested in buying over the next year.\u201d But, because of their student-debt loads, they cannot. \u201cWhen it comes to taking out a mortgage, they aren\u2019t able to carry that mortgage payment because they have very chunky payments to make to the lenders of their student loans. So that\u2019s certainly holding Millennials back along the way,\u201d Gudell says.

This person would like to put 20 percent down. If he or she follows the popular financial advice to save 10 percent of his or her annual pay, it\u2019ll take him or her about eight years to have that down payment ready to go. If that same person has $26,000 of student debt, which means monthly payments of $280 based on a 10-year repayment plan, it\u2019ll take this person closer to nine years.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\u2026 Rich parents.", "author": "Gillian B.
