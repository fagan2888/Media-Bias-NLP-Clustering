Warwick Sabin (D) cheers with protesters outside the House chamber at the Arkansas State Capitol in Little Rock after a House committee advanced H.B. 1228, a bill similar to Indiana\u2019s Religious Freedom Restoration Act.\n\nThere\u2019s an important debate going on in our country that lots of folks aren\u2019t paying much attention to. I can\u2019t say that I blame them. After all, with work, kids, bills, errands, and more\u2014how much energy is left over to think about religious freedom?\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing: The current debate about religious freedom is already shaping laws and policies that will affect each one of us. Many of these laws and policies are harmful and will have far-reaching consequences that affect the everyday details of our lives\u2014from our ability to shop at certain businesses to the cost of our health care\u2014that even the supporters of these laws are likely to regret.\n\nThat\u2019s because the laws and policies in question go too far. They promote a kind of religious freedom on steroids, a muscular bullying that aims to get its way regardless of the harm or cost it may inflict on others.\n\nBut one can support religious freedom and oppose that kind of harm at the same time.\n\nTake a look at the law passed in Indiana last week. It\u2019s called the Religious Freedom Restoration Act\u2014also known as RFRA\u2014and is modeled on the federal RFRA, which was the basis for last year\u2019s Hobby Lobby case before the Supreme Court.\n\nThe impetus for the Indiana RFRA was a 2014 court ruling in favor of marriage equality in the state. A few months after the ruling, conservatives in the Indiana Legislature introduced the bill, which would allow any business, corporation, or individual to claim their religious belief as a defense if sued by a private party. In other words, a baker, florist, photographer, jeweler, hotel owner\u2014the list goes on\u2014could refuse to serve lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender, or LGBT, people and cite his or her religion as a valid defense in court.\n\nA number of other states, including Georgia and Michigan, are considering their own RFRA bills. In each state, conservative opponents to marriage equality are hurrying to lock in religious exemptions as a way to opt out of civil rights laws. They know that time is running out, politically and socially, as support for such refusals declines.\n\nAs these legislative fights play out across the country, it\u2019s important for all of us to get up to speed on the issue of religious freedom in order to learn what\u2019s at stake and to speak out.\n\nFirst, we must determine what we mean by religious freedom. Does religious freedom belong to all Americans or only to a select few? Is religious freedom unlimited, no matter what cost its expression may impose on others? How can we honor and respect religion\u2014and its expression\u2014in a pluralistic society in which people have many different beliefs and practices?\n\nI would argue that religious freedom belongs to all Americans. Unfortunately, the Supreme Court said something quite different in its Hobby Lobby ruling last June. In a 5-4 decision, the Court basically said that the religious beliefs of Hobby Lobby\u2019s corporate owners not only deserve legal recognition but also trump the religious beliefs and health needs of the company\u2019s employees.\n\nIn its lawsuit, Hobby Lobby\u2019s owners objected on religious grounds to certain types of contraception and refused to include them in their health care plans as required by the Affordable Care Act. However, both the company\u2019s owners and a majority of the Supreme Court justices failed to acknowledge the fact that many\u2014if not the majority\u2014of Hobby Lobby\u2019s employees most likely hold different religious beliefs than the owners, therefore supporting and using the types of contraception that their bosses find immoral.\n\nIn essence, the Court ruled that the boss\u2019 religious freedom is more important than that of the workers. And its ruling has had real-world consequences: Hobby Lobby\u2019s employees are now literally forced to pay the costs of their boss\u2019 religious beliefs.\n\nI\u2019d call that an abuse of religious freedom. We all have the right to believe and practice our faith, but we do not have the right to coerce others to follow our beliefs or the right to cause others harm. That\u2019s where limits come in. All freedoms in a democracy have limits. And in our pluralistic society, religious freedom ought not to be different.\n\nA helpful way to think about religious freedom is to consider whether a particular practice imposes a significant burden on someone else or causes them harm. For instance, does the religious practice of wearing a hijab or yarmulke cause harm to others? Does wearing a beard? What about being served a kosher meal in prison? It\u2019s pretty hard to prove that any of these practices inflict harm on others.\n\nOn the other hand, there are times when the free exercise of one\u2019s religion does impose significant harm on groups of people. The Hobby Lobby decision, for example, harms its employees. And state RFRA laws can harm LGBT people and others who some may deem morally objectionable.\n\nIn addition to the real harm that these RFRAs inflict on targeted groups, they inflict broader, long-term damage on the perception of religion and religious freedom as a public good. The United States has always honored religious exemptions to its laws, understanding that the benefits outweigh whatever costs society, as a whole, might pay.\n\nBut it is not hard to predict a shift in public sentiment, given the Hobby Lobby ruling and state RFRAs, which allow certain religious believers to impose their beliefs on others. In fact, we are already seeing a backlash to Indiana\u2019s new law: Companies and other organizations view it as discriminatory and are threatening to pull their business from the state. When religion is equated with discrimination, no one benefits.\n\nIn a nation such as ours\u2014made up of a vibrant mix of religious believers and nonbelievers\u2014no one should be permitted to force others to follow beliefs that aren\u2019t their own or to use religion as an excuse to discriminate. Our religious freedom is too precious\u2014and too hard won\u2014to be squandered in such a way.\n\nSally Steenland is Director of the Faith and Progressive Policy Initiative at the Center for American Progress.
