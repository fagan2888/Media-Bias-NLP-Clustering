Peter Roskam\u2019s letter to the editor condemning its heavily criticized graphic that tracked members of Congress opposed to the Iran nuclear agreement, initially singling out Jewish lawmakers with a bold yellow highlight.\n\nRoskam said he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d the Times chose not to publish his letter, which he released in a statement Tuesday, calling the graphic\u2019s publication \u201cgross editorial negligence or shameful anti-Semitism.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf they want to have a robust argument and if they purport to be a venue for all perspectives they should have published the letter and it\u2019s regrettable that they didn\u2019t,\u201d Roskam told The Daily Signal.\n\nThe graphic was \u201cabsolutely inappropriate,\u201d he said, calling the Times\u2019 singling out of Jewish lawmakers a \u201ctroubling\u201d precursor to anti-Semitism that \u201cfeeds the canard of dual loyalty that legitimizes prejudice toward Jews worldwide.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe idea of people being categorized based on their faith and the implication that somehow their loyalty to the United States was put into question was absolutely jarring and historically it\u2019s been a prelude to terrible things when those sort of categories are used,\u201d he said.\n\nThe New York Times swiftly removed the \u201cJewish\u201d column from the graphic following significant backlash across social media criticizing the list as an anti-semitic \u201cJew Tracker.\u201d Editors initially made no mention of the omission other than a small note that the article was updated.\n\nA day later, the Times ran an extensive correction at the bottom of the original feature headlined, \u201cLawmakers Against the Iran Nuclear Deal,\u201d detailing reasons for the original inclusion of the Jewish categorization.\n\n\u201cA chart published on Thursday about Democrats in Congress who opposed the nuclear agreement with Iran oversimplified a complex aspect of the debate\u2014the views of Jewish members of Congress and the divisions among American Jews over the deal,\u201d the editor\u2019s note said. \u201cIn one version, which ran in print and for part of the day online, a separate column in the chart noted which congressional Democrats who opposed the deal were Jewish and which were not.\u201d\n\nThe note explained that under Times standards \u201cthe religion or ethnicity of someone in the news\u201d may be included if the fact is \u201crelevant and the relevance is clear to readers.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut the chart did not include this context, or make clear that Jewish voters and lawmakers, like other Americans, were sharply divided on the issue,\u201d the note said. \u201cIts emphasis may have left the impression that their Jewish identity was a decisive factor for Democrats who opposed the deal, an assumption that was not supported by reporting.\u201d\n\nRoskam, who opposed the Iran nuclear agreement, called the explanation \u201cabsurd\u201d given that Jewish members fell on both sides of the accord.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s completely unsatisfactory,\u201d he said. \u201dBasically, they\u2019re arguing, \u2018We\u2019re sorry our activities were offensive to you, but we\u2019re not apologizing for the activity itself.\u2019\u201d\n\nTimes Public Editor Margaret Sullivan later published an op-ed commending the paper for changing the \u201cinsensitive and inappropriate\u201d graphic.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The New York Times declined to publish Rep.
