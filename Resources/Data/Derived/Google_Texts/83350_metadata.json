No one has to be stuck in a dead-end job just to keep their health insurance. Thanks to the ACA, anyone can enroll in coverage through the health insurance marketplace within 60 days of losing health insurance coverage, even if they leave their job by choice.\n\nFree from fear of coverage denial\n\nMaria is an excellent example. When she left a job that provided health insurance to accept a much more exciting opportunity at a job that didn\u2019t offer coverage, she wasn\u2019t worried for a moment about getting covered \u2014 even though she has a pre-existing condition.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t go a single day without coverage because I knew what my new salary would be, so I could go ahead and sign up,\u201d Maria says. \u201cI didn\u2019t have to wait for my new job to start, which was awesome.\u201d\n\nThanks to Obamacare, Maria found a plan that was actually better than the one she had through her previous employer, with a reasonable premium and deductible and prescription coverage that was less expensive overall.\n\nMaria appreciated not feeling trapped in her old job, because having insurance options gave her the freedom to take the new and better opportunity. About eight years earlier, she had been in a job she hated but couldn\u2019t leave because health insurance was out of reach financially. The best she could do with a pre-existing condition was a catastrophic plan for $75 a month that \u201ccovered almost nothing\u201d with a $10,000 deductible. She stayed in that job for a year and a half, a choice she wasn\u2019t forced to make this time.\n\n\u201cAs a public librarian, most positions are part-time. I could have left my full-time job with benefits and combined a couple of part-time jobs \u2014 and still would have been able to afford insurance,\u201d Maria says. \u201cThe ACA made that a much more viable option. I have always been Team Obamacare, but my experience still exceeded my expectations.\u201d\n\nFree to pursue a dream career\n\nMaria is just one of millions of people who have freedom they didn\u2019t have before Obamacare \u2014 like Lisa, who was able to start her own business because she wasn\u2019t tied to a job just for the benefits.\n\nBefore the ACA, Lisa had a job in marketing, but working for others wasn\u2019t as satisfying as she would have liked. \u201cI never felt fulfilled,\u201d she says. \u201cI was always a writer first but I didn\u2019t know how to make a living out of it.\u201d\n\nFinally, Lisa decided it was time to get unstuck and start her own writing business. All she needed was health insurance.\n\n\u201cI have chronic conditions, so I\u2019d been turned down for insurance before,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s no way I could have gone out on my own without the ACA. Now I\u2019m doing something I love rather than being a cog in the machine, and I have better job security than someone changing jobs every couple years because they\u2019re bored and unhappy.\u201d\n\nAnd then there\u2019s Shawn, who says he has worried about health insurance since he was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes at age 10. He knows his father stayed with the same job so he wouldn\u2019t lose the health insurance his family needed, so Shawn wondered what would happen once he was no longer covered by his parents\u2019 plan.\n\nShawn doesn\u2019t have to think twice about that anymore thanks to Obamacare. Earlier this year, he moved across the country to accept an exciting career opportunity as a sports and entertainment marketing professional. The only thing it didn\u2019t offer was health insurance.\n\n\u201cWithout the ACA, I wouldn\u2019t have felt confident enough or financially secure enough to make this leap,\u201d Shawn says. \u201cLiving with type 1 diabetes is expensive, so I can never go without coverage.\u201d\n\nShawn had insurance at the job he left, but before that \u2014 and before the ACA \u2014 he had to do without coverage for about five months. Some insurance companies denied him altogether because he has type 1 diabetes. Other insurers charged so much, Shawn just couldn\u2019t afford it.\n\nBecause he changed jobs, Shawn was eligible to enroll within 60 days, even outside the open enrollment period. He found a plan that was a great fit for his needs, including paying 90 percent of the costs of the insulin pump and supplies he depends on to manage his diabetes and stay healthy.\n\n\u201cThose supplies are very expensive without insurance,\u201d he says, \u201cso that\u2019s a big deal.\u201d\n\nShawn says that without the ACA, he never would have been able to move across the country to pursue a career opportunity like the one he was offered.\n\n\u201cPresident Obama didn\u2019t have to take up health reform, but he knew it was important for people like me who need some financial security \u2014 for people like me who have profound pre-existing conditions and were priced out of the market or denied insurance,\u201d Shawn says. \u201cFor that, I\u2019m eternally grateful.", "article_metadata": {"description": "No one has to be stuck in a dead-end job just to keep their health insurance.
