The two protesters were taken into custody as the group marched through the financial district.\n\n___\n\n7:45 p.m.\n\nLeaders of about a dozen community groups say protests they are organizing over the next few days will be about more than the black teen shot to death by a white Chicago police officer.\n\nActivist JR Fleming says: \"We are angry because this city has declared war on black people.\"\n\nThe groups met Wednesday night to discuss a unified response to the killing of 17-year-old Laquan McDonald, who was shot 16 times in 2014. The city released video of the shooting on Tuesday, the same day Officer Jason Van Dyke was charged with murder in the killing.\n\nAfter the meeting, about 100 protesters marched roughly a half mile to Chicago police headquarters. A line of officers walked beside them to ensure they remained on the sidewalk.\n\nDemonstrators say in addition to police shootings, they've seen schools and mental health clinics in their communities closed, a lack of jobs and a high rate of unsolved murders.\n\nThey say a Black Friday protest aimed at shutting down a major downtown shopping area will send a message by hitting Chicago where it hurts \u2014 in the pocketbook.\n\n___\n\n7:30 p.m.\n\nPresident Barack Obama says he is \"deeply disturbed\" by video footage showing a white Chicago police officer fatally shooting a black teenager.\n\nProsecutors have charged Officer Jason Van Dyke with first-degree murder for the death last year of 17-year-old Laquan McDonald, who was shot 16 times.\n\nObama said on his Facebook page Wednesday that he is asking Americans to \"keep those who've suffered tragic loss in our thoughts and prayers\" this Thanksgiving, \"and to be thankful for the overwhelming majority of men and women in uniform who protect our communities with honor.\"\n\nObama says he is personally grateful to the people of his hometown \u2014 Chicago \u2014 for keeping protests peaceful.\n\n___\n\n5:15 p.m.\n\nDozens of protesters are marching in downtown Chicago, demanding justice for a black teenager fatally shot by a white police officer.\n\nThe small crowd gathered Wednesday evening with chants of \"indict, convict, send that killer cop to jail.\"\n\nThe marchers disrupted traffic along the busy State Street shopping corridor. A handful confronted police officers, staring them down and shouting in their faces.\n\nAuthorities on Tuesday charged Officer Jason Van Dyke with first-degree murder in the 2014 shooting death of 17-year-old Laquan McDonald. City officials released squad-car video of the incident.\n\n__\n\n3 p.m.\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders says all Americans \"should be sickened\" by video footage of a white Chicago police officer fatally shooting a black teenager.\n\nSanders said in an emailed statement on Wednesday that there needs to be action beyond echoing the phrase \"black lives matter.\" The U.S. senator from Vermont says there should be action and reform to criminal justice.\n\nHis comments come a day after the police officer was charged with first-degree murder and Chicago officials released a video of the 2014 shooting.\n\n___\n\n2:50 p.m.\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton says the family of a black teen fatally shot by a white Chicago police officer and residents in the city \"deserve justice and accountability.\"\n\nClinton made the comments in an emailed statement Wednesday, a day after the officer was charged with first-degree murder and the city released a squad-car video of the 2014 shooting.\n\nClinton says the case is a reminder that larger questions about the safety and respect of citizens need to be addressed.\n\nShe adds that police officers across the country are doing their duty honorably \"without resorting to unnecessary force.\"\n\n___\n\n2:15 p.m.\n\nAdvocacy groups and community leaders are calling for more investigations of the Chicago Police Department and authorities after the release of a video that shows a white police officer shooting a black teen.\n\nThe video was released Tuesday hours after the officer was charged with first-degree murder.\n\nThe Urban League of Chicago on Wednesday called for a federal Department of Justice investigation, alleging a pattern of \"discriminatory harassment\" against black people.\n\nThe Rev. Jesse Jackson says officers involved should be fired or at least suspended. He also wants a special prosecutor on the case, saying Cook County State's Attorney Anita Alvarez took too long to bring a murder charge in the 2014 shooting.\n\nA group of activists is expected to meet Wednesday to call for an independent investigation of police conduct.\n\n___\n\n1:50 p.m.\n\nA Cook County judge has dismissed a charge against a protester accused of hitting a police officer in Chicago.\n\nTwenty-two-year-old Malcolm London was among five protesters arrested during demonstrations sparked by a video of a black teenager being fatally shot last year by a white police officer.\n\nLondon was charged with aggravated battery of a police officer. Police said he struck an officer during one protest Tuesday night in downtown Chicago.\n\nJudge Peggy Chiampas said during a hearing Wednesday afternoon that the state's attorney's office recommended the charge be dismissed and told London he was free to go.\n\nLondon, who was wearing a T-shirt with the phrase \"Unapologetically black\" on it, walked outside the courthouse to loud cheers.

Jason Van Dyke, a Chicago police officer, was charged with first-degree murder in McDonald's death earlier Tuesday.\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that some of those arrested were women.
