Her tweets in particular came in for derision until a certain point when more or less everyone had figured out that Bynes was no longer fair game; the coverage as Bynes has by all accounts begun to put her life back together has been appropriately muted.\n\nThat was, until today, when Bynes\u2019 weight was the subject of an article in People magazine. Bynes, People reported, was walking \u201cthe road to recovery\u201d \u201cin snowshoes\u201d \u2014 not because exercise is cathartic or healthful but in order to lose weight. \u201cHer main goal was to lose 5 lbs. [sic] and she did,\u201d the owner of Bynes\u2019 preferred fitness retreat told People.\n\nThe story had fairly obviously been set up by the retreat, who provided People a photo of Bynes snowshoeing as well as information on the sort of programming they provide. It\u2019s one thing for a facility caring for a celebrity trying to get better to leak that information to a tabloid; it\u2019s quite another in the case of Bynes, for whom an unhealthy body image was inextricably bound with her time in the spotlight. Bynes had given an interview to Us Weekly in February 2013 in which she said she \u201cneed[s] to work out constantly\u201d and had recently moved to New York: \u201cI lost 4 lbs. [sic] since I moved. I\u2019m 121 lbs \u2014 my goal is 100 lbs.\u201d Framing her presently undergoing recovery as a weight-loss journey is deeply strange.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Fans are interested in Bynes' recovery.
