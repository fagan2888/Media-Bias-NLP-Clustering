Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in a widely publicized address in Istanbul that the West, including America, enjoys watching Muslim children die.

He made the remarks during a meeting of the Standing Committee for Economic and Commercial Cooperation of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, and was speaking about the West’s view of the Muslim world, Agence France-Presse reported.

“Believe me, they don’t like us,” he said, AFP reported. “They look like friends, but they want us dead — they like seeing our children die. How long will we stand that fact?”

Mr. Erdogan is a hardline Muslim who’s frequently cast a critical eye on the West. In his most recent speech, he referred to “foreigners” as maintaining interest in the Middle East only to exploit its riches, The Daily Caller said.

“Only we can solve our problems. I speak openly. Foreigners love oil, gold, diamonds and the cheap labor force of the Islamic world,” he said, AFP reported. “They like the conflicts, fights and quarrels of the Middle East.”

And his solution? The Middle East needs to unite, he said.

“The only condition to overcome the crisis in the Islamic world is unity, solidarity and alliance,” Mr. Erdogan said, AFP reported. “Believe me, we can resolve every problem as long as we are united. … If we act together, we will end the loneliness of Palestine which has continued for nearly one century. … It is possible to end the bloodshed in Iraq and killing of Syrian children if we unite.”
