If you make it through R.I.P. you\u2019ll surely be sent off to fight in the Global War on Terror. You\u2019ll be part of what I often heard called \u201cthe tip of the spear.\u201d\n\nThe war you\u2019re heading into has been going on for a remarkably long time. Imagine this: you were five years old when I was first deployed to Afghanistan in 2002. Now I\u2019m graying a bit, losing a little up top, and I have a family. Believe me, it goes faster than you expect.\n\nOnce you get to a certain age, you can\u2019t help thinking about the decisions you made (or that, in a sense, were made for you) when you were younger. I do that and someday you will, too. Reflecting on my own years in the 75th Ranger regiment, at a moment when the war you\u2019ll find yourself immersed in was just beginning, I\u2019ve tried to jot down a few of the things they don\u2019t tell you at the recruiting office or in the pro-military Hollywood movies that may have influenced your decision to join. Maybe my experience will give you a perspective you haven\u2019t considered.\n\nI imagine you\u2019re entering the military for the same reason just about everyone volunteers: it felt like your only option. Maybe it was money, or a judge, or a need for a rite of passage, or the end of athletic stardom. Maybe you still believe that the U.S. is fighting for freedom and democracy around the world and in existential danger from \u201cthe terrorists.\u201d Maybe it seems like the only reasonable thing to do: defend our country against terrorism.\n\nThe media has been a powerful propaganda tool when it comes to promoting that image, despite the fact that, as a civilian, you were more likely to be killed by a toddler than a terrorist. I trust you don\u2019t want regrets when you\u2019re older and that you commendably want to do something meaningful with your life. I\u2019m sure you hope to be the best at something. That\u2019s why you signed up to be a Ranger.\n\nMake no mistake: whatever the news may say about the changing cast of characters the U.S. is fighting and the changing motivations behind the changing names of our military \u201coperations\u201d around the world, you and I will have fought in the same war. It\u2019s hard to believe that you will be taking us into the 14th year of the Global War on Terror (whatever they may be calling it now). I wonder which one of the 668 U.S. military bases worldwide you\u2019ll be sent to.\n\nIn its basics, our global war is less complicated to understand than you might think, despite the difficult-to-keep-track-of enemies you will be sent after \u2014 whether al-Qaeda (\u201ccentral,\u201d al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, in the Magreb, etc.), or the Taliban, or al-Shabab in Somalia, or ISIS (aka ISIL, or the Islamic State), or Iran, or the al-Nusra Front, or Bashar al-Assad\u2019s regime in Syria. Admittedly, it\u2019s a little hard to keep a reasonable scorecard. Are the Shia or the Sunnis our allies? Is it Islam we\u2019re at war with? Are we against ISIS or the Assad regime or both of them?\n\nJust who these groups are matters, but there\u2019s an underlying point that it\u2019s been too easy to overlook in recent years: ever since this country\u2019s first Afghan War in the 1980s (that spurred the formation of the original al-Qaeda), our foreign and military policies have played a crucial role in creating those you will be sent to fight. Once you are in one of the three battalions of the 75th Ranger Regiment, the chain-of-command will do its best to reduce global politics and the long-term good of the planet to the smallest of matters and replace them with the largest of tasks: boot polishing, perfectly made beds, tight shot groupings at the firing range, and your bonds with the Rangers to your right and left.\n\nIn such circumstances, it\u2019s difficult \u2014 I know that well \u2014 but not impossible to keep in mind that your actions in the military involve far more than whatever\u2019s in front of you or in your gun sights at any given moment. Our military operations around the world \u2014 and soon that will mean you \u2014 have produced all kinds of blowback. Thought about a certain way, I was being sent out in 2002 to respond to the blowback created by the first Afghan War and you\u2019re about to be sent out to deal with the blowback created by my version of the second one.\n\nI\u2019m writing this letter in the hope that offering you a little of my own story might help frame the bigger picture for you.\n\nLet me start with my first day \u201con the job.\u201d I remember dropping my canvas duffle bag at the foot of my bunk in Charlie Company, and almost immediately being called into my platoon sergeant\u2019s office. I sprinted down a well-buffed hallway, shadowed by the platoon\u2019s \u201cmascot\u201d: a Grim-Reaper-style figure with the battalion\u2019s red and black scroll beneath it. It hovered like something you\u2019d see in a haunted house on the cinder block wall adjoining the sergeant\u2019s office. It seemed to be watching me as I snapped to attention in his doorway, beads of sweat on my forehead. \u201cAt ease\u2026 Why are you here, Fanning? Why do you think you should be a Ranger?\u201d All this he said with an air of suspicion.\n\nShaken, after being screamed out of a bus with all my gear, across an expansive lawn in front of the company\u2019s barracks, and up three flights of stairs to my new home, I responded hesitantly, \u201cUmm, I want to help prevent another 9/11, First Sergeant.\u201d It must have sounded almost like a question.\n\n\u201cThere is only one answer to what I just asked you, son. That is: you want to feel the warm red blood of your enemy run down your knife blade.\u201d\n\nTaking in his military awards, the multiple tall stacks of manila folders on his desk, and the photos of what turned out to be his platoon in Afghanistan, I said in a loud voice that rang remarkably hollowly, at least to me, \u201cRoger, First Sergeant!\u201d\n\nHe dropped his head and started filling out a form. \u201cWe\u2019re done here,\u201d he said without even bothering to look up again.\n\nThe platoon sergeant\u2019s answer had a distinct hint of lust in it but, surrounded by all those folders, he also looked to me like a bureaucrat. Surely such a question deserved something more than the few impersonal and sociopathic seconds I spent in that doorway.\n\nNonetheless, I spun around and ran back to my bunk to unpack, not just my gear but also his disturbing answer to his own question and my sheepish, \u201cRoger, First Sergeant!\u201d reply. Until that moment, I hadn\u2019t thought of killing in such an intimate way. I had indeed signed on with the idea of preventing another 9/11. Killing was still an abstract idea to me, something I didn\u2019t look forward to. He undoubtedly knew this. So what was he doing?\n\nAs you head into your new life, let me try to unpack his answer and my experience as a Ranger for you.\n\nLet\u2019s start that unpacking process with racism:That was the first and one of the last times I heard the word \u201cenemy\u201d in battalion. The usual word in my unit was \u201cHajji.\u201d Now, Hajji is a word of honor among Muslims, referring to someone who has successfully completed a pilgrimage to the Holy Site of Mecca in Saudi Arabia. In the U.S. military, however, it was a slur that implied something so much bigger.\n\nThe soldiers in my unit just assumed that the mission of the small band of people who took down the Twin Towers and put a hole in the Pentagon could be applied to any religious person among the more than 1.6 billion Muslims on this planet. The platoon sergeant would soon help usher me into group-blame mode with that \u201cenemy.\u201d I was to be taught instrumental aggression. The pain caused by 9/11 was to be tied to the everyday group dynamics of our unit. This is how they would get me to fight effectively. I was about to be cut off from my previous life and psychological manipulation of a radical sort would be involved. This is something you should prepare yourself for.\n\nWhen you start hearing the same type of language from your chain-of-command in its attempt to dehumanize the people you are off to fight, remember that 93% of all Muslims condemned the attacks on 9/11. And those who sympathized claimed they feared a U.S. occupation and cited political not religious reasons for their support.\n\nBut, to be blunt, as George W. Bush said early on (and then never repeated), the war on terror was indeed imagined in the highest of places as a \u201ccrusade.\u201d When I was in the Rangers, that was a given. The formula was simple enough: al-Qaeda and the Taliban represented all of Islam, which was our enemy. Now, in that group-blame game, ISIS, with its mini-terror state in Iraq and Syria, has taken over the role. Be clear again that nearly all Muslimsreject its tactics. Even Sunnis in the region where ISIS is operating are increasingly rejecting the group. And it is those Sunnis who may indeed take down ISIS when the time is right.", "article_metadata": {"description": "When I signed up for the military, I wanted to save the world.
