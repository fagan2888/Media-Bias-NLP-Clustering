Bernie Sanders bypassed for rallies in Colorado and Oklahoma.\n\nThe candidate reiterated her support for affordable healthcare and education while calling for an overhaul of the criminal justice system and an end to systemic racism.\n\n\u201cMy campaign is really about breaking down barriers,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cAmerica doesn\u2019t need to be great, it needs to be whole.\u201d\n\nClinton supporters and others who just wanted to catch a glimpse of the former first lady, senator and Secretary of State waited in line for more than two hours in warm weather before being allowed inside.\n\nSamantha Hampton, a Clarksville fourth-grader, said she wanted to see Clinton because she really wants to see a female president.\n\n\u201cI think she\u2019s a really good person,\u201d Hampton said.\n\nAnd although the crowd appeared to represent a wide-range demographically, Clinton\u2019s efforts to gain minority votes appeared evident in her choice of venue. Meharry Medical College is the oldest and largest historically black institution of its kind in the nation.\n\nAn estimated 800 people filled the Center\u2019s ballroom \u2014 with a posted legal capacity of about 500 \u2014 with the overflow being sent to a nearby auditorium.\n\nWill Nelms, a communication major at Middle Tennessee University in Murfreesboro, came to the rally with two friends despite favoring a candidate from the Republican party nomination.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a [Marco] Rubio supporter,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019ve always been fascinated with the politics and the primaries. I\u2019m just here to take part in the process, whatever that means.\u201d\n\nClinton\u2019s introduction to this Sunday crowd came via rousing endorsements from Nashville Mayor Megan Barry and actor Tony Goldwyn, who portrays fictional U.S. president Fitzgerald Grant III in the television drama \u201cScandal.\u201d\n\nGoldyn\u2019s mention of Republican candidates Donald Trump and Ted Cruz drew a chorus of boos from the crowd, but the speaker said he respected Sanders for his stance on some of the issues, but contended Clinton\u2019s primary opponent offered no solutions for funding his plans.\n\n\u201cWe need to fight for Hillary as hard as we know she\u2019s going to fight for us,\u201d Goldwyn said.\n\nClinton said she wants work somewhere between government and the private sector to create more jobs and to increase the minimum wage.\n\n\u201cWe also have a lot of work to do that\u2019s invisible,\u201d she said, referring to the nation\u2019s infrastructures like clean drinking water.\n\nThe candidate said she supports healthcare reforms made under President Barrack Obama and vowed to work to improve it to ensure affordable health care for everyone.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t go back,\u201d she said.\n\nConcerning education, Clinton said she wants to help make getting a college education affordable, and vowed to create a special fund to ensure historically black colleges continue serving their communities. Her latter comment drew applause and screams from a group of Meharry students wearing white lab coats.\n\nClinton also said it didn\u2019t make sense that Americans can refinance their cars and homes, but college students cannot refinance their college loans.\n\n\u201cThe interest rates on college rates now are outrageous,\u201d she said.\n\nOn the issue of criminal justice and systemic racism, Clinton \u2014 although supporting law enforcement \u2014 said there are some who need retraining.\n\n\u201cWe want all people to be equal before the law,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you join me in this journey, I know we can do this.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "NASHVILLE \u2014 With no time to stop and savor her Democratic primary victory in South Carolina on Saturday, presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton plowed on with a hectic campaign schedule that includes stops in five states in two days before voters head to the polls on Super Tuesday.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "VANESSA CURRY vcurry@c-dh.net", "og": {"site_name": "Columbia Daily Herald", "description": "NASHVILLE \u2014 With no time to stop and savor her Democratic primary victory in South Carolina on Saturday, presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton plowed on with a hectic campaign schedule that includes stops in five states in two days before voters head to the polls on Super Tuesday.", "title": "Hillary rallies in Nashville", "url": "http://columbiadailyherald.com/news/local-news/hillary-rallies-nashville", "image": "http://columbiadailyherald.com/sites/columbiadailyherald.com/files/field/media/web1_Hillary-Clinton_0.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://columbiadailyherald.com/news/local-news/hillary-rallies-nashville", "title": "Hillary rallies in Nashville", "card": "summary", "creator": "@thedailyherald"}, "al": {"web": {"should_fallback": "true"}, "android": {"url": "columbiadailyherald://?eid=1461475", "app_name": "columbiadailyherald", "package": "com.stephensmedia.columbiadailyherald"}, "ios": {"url": "columbiadailyherald://?eid=1461475", "app_store_id": 964773799, "app_name": "columbiadailyherald"}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=964773799", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.stephensmedia.columbiadailyherald", "keywords": "Local News,,", "article": {"published_time": "2016-02-28T23:52:07-06:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=0.9"}, "article_summary": "Samantha Hampton, a Clarksville fourth-grader, said she wanted to see Clinton because she really wants to see a female president.\nClinton said she wants work somewhere between government and the private sector to create more jobs and to increase the minimum wage.\nClinton addressed an overflowing crowd at the Cal Turner Center on the campus of Meharry Medical College in Nashville on Sunday afternoon \u2014 a city her democratic opponent Sen.
