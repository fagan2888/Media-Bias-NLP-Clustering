Tom Cotton by Mark Pryor is so huge that it\u2019s impossible to overstate. Interviewed by NBC News while fighting an uphill battle to retain his Senate seat, Pryor claimed that Cotton\u2019s pursuit of his office came from a \u201csense of entitlement\u201d from having served in the military, emphasis mine:\n\n\u201cSome people say I\u2019m a young man in a hurry. Guess what? They\u2019re right. We\u2019ve got urgent problems and I am in a hurry to solve them,\u201d Cotton said when he announced his Senate bid. The quick rise has won him an attack ad from Pryor, who says that Cotton has \u201cblind ambition\u201d and a sense of entitlement that will turn voters off, even considering his military background. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of people in the Senate that didn\u2019t serve in the military,\u201d Pryor told NBC News. \u201cObviously in the Senate we have all types of different people, all kinds of different folks that have come from all types of different backgrounds\u2014and I think that\u2019s part of that sense of entitlement that he gives off is that, almost like, I served my country, let me into the Senate. But that\u2019s not how it works in Arkansas.\u201d\n\nNo? How does it work in Arkansas? Apparently, having your daddy be Governor and Senator first is a much more legitimate platform for entitlement:\n\nIf Pryor is going to hang on, it\u2019s because to many of the voters here in Arkansas, he\u2019s almost family. \u2026 The Senate seat Pryor holds has been in his family for a total of three decades. His father is one of what they call the \u201cbig three\u201d in Arkansas politics: David Pryor, who was governor and senator; Dale Bumpers, also governor and senator; and Bill Clinton, who was governor and, of course, president of the United States.\n\nNotably, no one on the Morning Joe panel wanted to defend Pryor:\n\nNotice the chyron? \u201cPryor\u2019s father was Governor and Senator of Arkansas.\u201d Not even the production booth missed the irony of someone trading on the family name lashing out at his opponent\u2019s supposed \u201csense of entitlement.\u201d Pryor was probably toast anyway, but this should bury him \u2014 and the family dynasty.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Says the scion.", "title": "Pryor: Military service makes Tom Cotton feel \u201centitlement,\u201d or something", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2014/03/05/pryor-military-service-makes-tom-cotton-feel-entitlement-or-something/", "image": {"secure_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/Y09nIxRgXcA/0.jpg", "identifier": "http://img.youtube.com/vi/Y09nIxRgXcA/0.jpg"}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-03-05T13:41:59+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-03-05T13:40:59+00:00"}, "keywords": "2014 election, Mark Pryor, Tom Cotton, US Senate,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda0e1\"", "article_summary": "Pryor: Military service makes Tom Cotton feel \u201centitlement,\u201d or somethingposted at 8:41 am on March 5, 2014 by Ed MorrisseyThe irony of this attack on Rep.
