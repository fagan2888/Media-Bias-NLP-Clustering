Two people were sent to the hospital after a traffic crash Saturday morning in Fort Walton Beach.

According to Ft. Walton Beach Police, 36-year old Gary William Caraglior, was traveling westbound down Miracle Strip Parkway when he lost control, left the westbound traffic lanes and crossed over the eastbound lanes.

On the east shoulder, the vehicle crashed into two decorative metal light poles and approximately 25-feet of railing along which several patrons of The Green Door were gathered. The vehicle struck two patrons, one of which sustained a fractured arm and was transported to FWB Medical Center for treatment. A second patron self-transported himself to FWB Medical Center for hand injuries.

Police say Caraglior was found to be under the influence of unknown substances. Caraglior suddenly attempted to flee the scene, but was later detained by officer. He was held for medical evaluation and treatment for the effects of the unknown substance(s) which he consumed.

The case is still under investigation. Charges are pending chemical testing results.
