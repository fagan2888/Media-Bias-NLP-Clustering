According to the U.S. Registered Nurse Workforce Report Card and Shortage Forecast, a shortage of registered nurses is projected to spread across the country between 2009 and 2030.\n\nProjections from a separate agency, the Heath Resources and Services Administration, state that the nursing shortage will grow to more than 1 million by 2020.\n\n\u0093About 42 percent of nurses in Iowa are 50 years old or older,\u0094 said Rita Frantz, dean of the University of Iowa\u0092s College of Nursing. \u0093So there will be an exodus in the next 10 years or so\u0094 as the state\u0092s nurses retire.\n\nCorridor hospitals and higher education institutions are working with organizations across the state to combat the potential problems.\n\nAn educational push\n\nThe Iowa Action Coalition, which was formed in 2012 and is headed by Frantz, is working with stakeholders in health care to address future challenges in staffing. One of its main goals is to increase the number of nurses who have bachelors of science in nursing, or BSN.\n\n\u0093We really want to promote the move from one degree to another,\u0094 Frantz said.\n\nAbout 26 percent of Iowa\u0092s nurses have bachelor\u0092s degrees \u0097 far below the national average of 50 percent. The coalition wants to increase that number to 50 percent by 2020.\n\n\u0093More and more hospitals give preferential hiring to nurses with their BSN, because they are more able to manage the complex health care environment,\u0094 she said.\n\nThat\u0092s one reason why Kirkwood Community College nursing student Eileen Le, 26, is planning to get her bachelor\u0092s degree after she graduates in December with an associate degree.\n\nLe, originally from Minnesota, said she is considering attending Upper Iowa University or Mount Mercy University. She said she always wanted to get her bachelor\u0092s degree eventually but thought she may enter the workforce first.\n\nAs she went through Kirkwood\u0092s five-semester program, though, instructors encouraged her to move straight into the next educational phase.\n\nStudies suggest that a more highly educated nursing base may improve patient outcomes, said Jimmy Reyes, dean of nursing at Kirkwood.\n\nStaffs with higher percentages of baccalaureate-educated nurses have lower mortality and failure-to-rescue rates. Researchers found that a 10 percent increase in the proportion of BSN nurses on staff was associated with a 4 percent decrease in the risk of death.\n\nReyes said community colleges want to offer more prerequisite classes to make the transition from an associate\u0092s program to a bachelor\u0092s program more seamless for students.\n\n\u0093A BSN shouldn\u0092t be standard, but we should help more community college students attain that standard,\u0094 he said.\n\nMore nurses with a BSN means more nurses can pursue master\u0092s and doctoral programs. About 13 percent of nurses hold a graduate degree, and fewer than 1 percent hold a doctoral degree, according to the Institute of Medicine\u0092s Future of Nursing report.\n\nIf more nurses pursue graduate programs, more can become nurse practitioners, educators or researchers, which can help solve multiple problems, Frantz and Reyes said.\n\nColleges and universities also must produce nurse educators, Reyes said, to continue to produce a steady number of nurses each year. An American Association of Colleges of Nursing study found that about 75,587 qualified students were turned away from baccalaureate and graduate nursing programs in 2011 because of a lack of faculty, clinical sites or classroom space.\n\n\u0093We had about seven faculty spots open five months ago,\u0094 Reyes said. Kirkwood is also at capacity when it comes to the number of nursing students it can accept each semester. \u0093Right now, it\u0092s not a shortage of faculty, but it\u0092s clinical capacity.\u0094\n\nShifting resources\n\nThere is also a growing need for nurse practitioners, physician\u0092s assistants and primary care doctors, Frantz said.\n\n\u0093The expansion of the number of people who will soon have health care means that primary care providers will be in greater demand,\u0094 she said.\n\nHospitals, meanwhile, are re-evaluating nursing needs.\n\nAnn Williamson, associate vice president for nursing at UI Health Care and the chief nursing officer for University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics, said the hospital may not need to increase its 2,400 nurses, but it will have to shift its resources and how those nurses are used.\n\n\u0093Health care is changing from being very task-oriented and moving into a community setting,\u0094 she said. \u0093More will need to work in home care or long-term care.\u0094\n\nHealth-care delivery is changing, she said. More nurses may soon be needed to do home visits, ambulatory care, participate in telemedicine or coach and track patients who need long-term care, Williamson said.\n\nBaccalaureate degrees better equip nurses to deal with these more complex situations, as well as better prepare nurses for independent practice, advanced clinical roles and acute care.\n\nHospitals need to do a better job of identifying high-risk patients and offer more complete and preventive services to these patients, said St. Luke\u0092s Osborn.\n\nShe said the hospital introduced the role of nurse navigator, which requires a master\u0092s degree, about 18 months ago. The navigator works with social workers, dietitians and a team of other professionals to help with patients\u0092 long-term care needs.\n\nMore highly educated nurses have a more complete understanding of how the heath-care system works and topics that aren\u0092t covered in an associate\u0092s program. These nurses are also able to better handle the increasing complexity of technology and medical therapies and treatments.\n\n\u0093We have to make sure skills meet the population\u0092s needs,\u0094 said Cynthia Lewis, the chief nursing officer for Mercy Medical Center. \u0093Look at the faces of the community. Most of us are aging. Those relationships with health care providers are more important.\u0094", "article_metadata": {"Description": "The Gazette | Mary Ann Osborn believes a perfect storm is brewing on the state\u0092s health care horizon.Iowa\u0092s aging population, combined with the thousands of residents who now", "og": {"url": "http://www.thegazette.com/2013/10/09/medical-industry-heads-off-looming-nurse-shortage", "type": "article", "image": "http://www.thegazette.com/storyimage/GA/20131009/NEWS/310099997/EP/1/1/EP-310099997.jpg", "site_name": "The Gazette", "description": "Mary Ann Osborn believes a perfect storm is brewing on the state\u0092s health care horizon."}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thegazette.com/2013/10/09/medical-industry-heads-off-looming-nurse-shortage", "title": "Medical industry heads off looming nurse shortage", "description": "Mary Ann Osborn believes a perfect storm is brewing on the state\u0092s health care horizon.", "site": "@gazettedotcom"}, "MobileOptimized": 320, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "bt": {"title": "Medical industry heads off looming nurse shortage", "type": "thegazette_", "pubDate": "2013-10-09T05:30:00-05:00", "modDate": "2014-03-28T21:34:00-05:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 163646090334606}, "apple-touch-fullscreen": "yes", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf4f9\"", "article_summary": "Mary Ann Osborn believes a perfect storm is brewing on the state\u0092s health care horizon.\nRegistered Nurse Workforce Report Card and Shortage Forecast, a shortage of registered nurses is projected to spread across the country between 2009 and 2030.\nIowa\u0092s aging population, combined with the thousands of residents who now have access to health care because of the Affordable Care Act, could bring about a nursing shortage.\nThose relationships with health care providers are more important.\u0094\n\u0093Health care is changing from being very task-oriented and moving into a community setting,\u0094 she said."}
