John Walsh has borrowed from.\n\nThe New York Times broadsided on Wednesday the appointed senator, who faces a difficult election campaign to begin with, by detailing a plagiarism case regarding his 2007 college thesis. But the Democratic senator got some good news the same day: His legislation to eliminate tax provisions exploited by outsourcing companies surprisingly advanced past a Republican filibuster, 93-7.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nBut it turns out that wasn\u2019t really his legislation. Walsh\u2019s \u201cBrings Jobs Home Act\u201d is identical to legislation written by Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) that failed in 2012, when Stabenow was running for reelection.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: 10 high profile plagiarism cases)\n\nMembers of the same party frequently borrow from each others\u2019 legislation \u2014 and Stabenow is a co-sponsor of Walsh\u2019s 2014 retread of the \u201cBring Jobs Home Act.\u201d Just two weeks ago the Senate voted on North Carolina Democrat Kay Hagan\u2019s Bipartisan Sportsmen\u2019s Act, which had a very similar thrust to Montana Democrat Jon Tester\u2019s 2012 hunting and fishing bill, though it contained some changes. Tester was up for reelection in 2012, Hagan is up in 2014 \u2014 both respective bills failed.\n\nAnd the practice isn\u2019t limited to Democrats. In 2012 House Republicans laregly swiped a bill from Rep. Jim Himes (D-Conn.) and bestowed it on former Rep. Ben Quayle (R-Ariz.), who was locked in a tight primary. And swiping someone\u2019s ideas for a bill isn\u2019t considered to be on the same level as stealing from others\u2019 research for a personal college thesis.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Report: Walsh plagiarized college thesis)\n\nBut Walsh\u2019s legislation is more blatant than most: According to an analysis of the two bills run through a text comparison website, the biggest change to the bill in the intervening two years is the capitalization of the letter T. The only other changes that the program picked up were several additional spaces that have been inserted in the bill.\n\nAnd in light of the plagiarism report in the Times, the timing could not be more inopportune.\n\nA Walsh spokeswoman said Stabenow \u201casked Sen. Walsh to introduce the bill. It is not uncommon for Senators to work together and for bills to be reintroduced from Congress to Congress by different members.\u201d\n\nThe legislative success of the Walsh-sponsored bill is likely to be short-lived. Republicans took to the floor to pan the bill for losing $214 million in revenue over 10 years, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation. They are also demanding votes on amendments \u2014 including Louisiana GOP Sen. David Vitter\u2019s bill to gut health-care contributions to Capitol Hill aides and lawmakers.\n\nIt\u2019s not the first case of bad timing to strike Walsh\u2019s legislation. In May he introduced legislation called the \u201cDo Your Job Act\u201d that would prohibit Congress from recessing if it did not produce a long-term balanced budget. After introducing the bill, Walsh promptly flew back to Montana on recess, an incongruence not lost on GOP sources tracking Walsh.\n\nBut at least it was significantly different from Iowa GOP Rep. Tom Latham\u2019s \u201cDo Your Job Act\u201d of 2012, which would keep lawmakers from getting paid if they don\u2019t pass a yearly budget.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "His &quot;Bring Jobs Home Act&quot; is nearly identical in wording to what Debbie Stabenow wrote in 2012.", "title": "Borrowed time: Tale of a Walsh bill", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/07/john-walsh-bring-jobs-home-act-bill-109307.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/07/23/140723_john_walsh_msm_605.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Debbie Stabenow,Montana,John Walsh,Democrats,Plagiarism", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "His &quot;Bring Jobs Home Act&quot; is nearly identical in wording to what Debbie Stabenow wrote in 2012.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd095f\"", "article_summary": "| M.Scott Mahaskey/POLITICO Borrowed time: Tale of a Walsh billA college thesis isn\u2019t the only source that Montana Sen.
