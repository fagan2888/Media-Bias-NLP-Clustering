A report conducted by Senate Republicans estimates the Obama administration gave about $750 million in Obamacare health insurance subsidies to illegal immigrants who aren't eligible for them.

The report, released Monday by the Senate Homeland Security Committee, also says that while the IRS has implemented a plan to take back the government assistance, the plan is "ineffective and insufficient."

Illegal immigrants aren't eligible for health insurance subsidies provided to low-income Americans through President Obama's healthcare law. But some still succeeded in collecting the government assistance, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which announced in June that it had ended coverage for about 423,000 consumers who had failed to produce "sufficient documentation on their citizenship or immigration status."

Republicans on the Homeland Security Committee had been looking into the issue over the last year under the direction of Chairman Ron Johnson, R-Wis. The report, first reported by Fox News, also says that CMS failed to coordinate with the IRS on a plan to recoup the improper payments.
