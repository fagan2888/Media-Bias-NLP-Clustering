May your loved ones be close by with warm wishes and your cares \u2014 and any honey-do lists \u2014 miles away.\n\nOn this Father\u2019s Day, we all owe a debt of thanks to the dads, stepdads, granddads, uncles and other father figures in our lives. The best present is always the one that money can\u2019t buy \u2014 a call or a visit and some heartfelt words of thanks.\n\nAt turns difficult, messy, exhausting and overwhelming, parenthood is also one of the most joy-filled and rewarding pursuits. It is also a lifetime commitment.\n\nWhile we laud those fathers who give their all day in and day out, we know that far too many fathers are absent, leaving their children without a crucial role model and source of love and stability.\n\nA clever catchphrase promoting adoption for AdoptUSKids reminds, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be perfect to be a perfect parent.\u201d It\u2019s true for those considering adoption, and it\u2019s true for all parents as well as the many teachers, coaches, pastors, uncles, godparents and others who serve as role models and mentors to our young people.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t require perfection to step up and help shape a child into a strong adult; what it takes is simply a steady dose of presence and love. The following qualities don\u2019t hurt, either:\n\n\u25a0 Leadership: A good dad sets an example. He has a strong character and follows a moral compass that inspires his children and others.\n\n\u25a0 Empathy: While not all dads are effusive in sharing their feelings, his children know through a word (or the occasional lecture), a gesture or maybe even just a look that he cares.\n\n\u25a0 Selflessness: He puts his needs behind those of his children. Whether singing lullabies at 3 a.m., changing the umpteenth diaper of the day, forgoing his wants for a child\u2019s new baseball cleats or celebrating an adult child\u2019s professional successes, he\u2019s always there.\n\n\u25a0 Patience: We\u2019ve all known our share of hard-headed children \u2014 or perhaps been one ourselves \u2014 so this quality is key.\n\n\u25a0 Love: No matter dad\u2019s personality, the one defining characteristic of a father is that he loves his children and shows it through his actions every day.\n\nNear or far, living or passed, dads deserve our praise and celebration today. So make sure you reflect a little of the love that he gave you back to him or out into the world.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Opinion, The Capital-Journal, Editorials", "og": {"url": "http://cjonline.com/opinion/2014-06-14/editorial-sharing-thoughts-fathers-day", "type": "article", "image": "http://cjonline.com/sites/default/files/images/sms-default-facebook-share.png", "site_name": "CJOnline.com", "title": "Editorial: Sharing thoughts on Father's Day"}, "description": "If you\u2019re a father, we hope today that you\u2019re enjoying this newspaper \u2014 its print edition or on your favorite tablet or mobile device \u2014 in a favorite easy chair, or perhaps on a porch or patio, coffee or beverage of choice in hand and a day of relaxation stretching ahead.
