Companies engaged in whistleblower litigation can often feel as though they are facing an uphill battle, and nowhere is this more apparent than in False Claims Act (FCA) qui tam litigation. Whistleblowers are armed with inside corporate knowledge, internal documents, and a list of key potential witnesses to corroborate their claims. In some instances, professional whistleblowers with specialized knowledge about the alleged fraudulent financial practices or the company’s industry may be added to a case to bolster the whistleblower’s claims. Although defendants often claim that the statute stacks the deck against them, knowledge of the procedural and legal hurdles they will face can help companies better arm themselves to fight the uphill battle of qui tam litigation.

Making Your First Move: Determining Whether to Go on the Offensive

Once the complaint is unsealed, companies must determine whether and to what extent they will challenge the court’s jurisdiction to hear the qui tam action or make affirmative claims against the whistleblower. In general, the quickest way to dismiss an FCA case is to prove that the court lacks jurisdiction or is statutorily barred from hearing the case. While these types of challenges are common place in ordinary civil litigation, there are procedural and legal differences that complicate them in qui tam litigation. For example, the public disclosure bar that precludes an FCA claim based on information disclosed to the public in certain situations is one of the strongest affirmative defenses to an FCA action. However, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) made changes to the public disclosure bar that give the government the right to stop a court from dismissing a claim on this basis. Thus, a court may be prohibited from dismissing an FCA action based on the public disclosure bar — even if valid grounds for dismissal exist — where the government opposes the motion to dismiss.
