And no one could seem to understand why it appeared that such an enormous amount of money, billions of dollars a year, were being poured into these programs, but providers were being paid so little and so poorly.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was tasked with looking at this and seeing what I could find out and seeing if there were legislative solutions,\u201d Feinwachs said.\n\nFour HMOs in Minnesota \u2014 Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Minnesota, Medica, Health Partners, and UCare \u2014 dominate the health insurance market.\n\n\u201cI found out that the HMO vendors to these Medicaid programs made five times more money managing public healthcare programs for the state than they did selling commercial insurance products to healthy working people,\u201d Feinwachs said. \u201cThey reported their profitability by line of business. And those figures struck me as astounding \u2013 in fact, nearly impossible. That\u2019s one thing I found out.\u201d\n\n\u201cI also found out while all the health care providers \u2013 all of them \u2013 lost on every kind of public health care program and of course lost on them in the aggregate, the HMOs or the health plans, profited in the aggregate.\u201d\n\nFeinwachs believes fraud is involved.\n\n\u201cRight before I was fired in August 2010, I was asked to participate in a conference call with a person who worked for our Department of Human Services,\u201d Feinwachs says. \u201cThe hospital association had hired a consultant. And the recommendation of the consultant was that within the Medicaid structure, there are things called intergovernmental transfers \u2013 ITTs \u2013 certified public expenditures \u2013 CPEs. And these are tactics where you can put up money to increase federal matching dollars.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey involve things like imposing a provider tax and then the federal government matches the amount that is taxed. Or paying public hospitals a higher rate, which the federal government matches and then the higher rate is infused back into the whole system. These are unsavory tactics. But they are legal tactics. The government is aware of them. The government doesn\u2019t love them. But they occur every day.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe consultant recommended that Minnesota should do this because \u2014 you are not doing any of this and you are missing an opportunity. A conference call was scheduled to discuss the reluctance. I listened in on the conference call but my presence was not disclosed to the person who worked at the Department of Human Services. Had it been, she never would have said anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cDuring the course of the conference call, she explained the reluctance to do these things by saying that Minnesota was already engaged in a strategy whereby we were working with the insurers for state only funded programs that didn\u2019t receive federal matching money, we were playing with the books, making their reserve requirements and other necessities zero and then maxing them out on the federal side to increase federal funding, blending the rate and then giving it back to the insurers.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I heard this, after the call, I immediately reported it to my superior, the president of the hospital association, and told him what had been said. And I told him, in my estimation, that this was not only inappropriate, but it was in fact, illegal.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was criminal. It was Medicaid fraud. He looked at me as if I had come recently from another planet. He didn\u2019t know what to make of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter that, I became strident in my insistence on the issue. That was in August 2010. And on October 20, 2010, I was placed on administrative leave. And two weeks later, my employment was terminated.\u201d\n\nDid Feinwachs report the conference call information to federal prosecutors?\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the time, I told the president of the Minnesota Hospital Association.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was fired for gross insubordination. I was then offered money in exchange for signing an agreement saying that I would never speak of these issues again.\u201d\n\nHow much money?\n\n\u201cThe first offer was something like $30,000. I didn\u2019t do anything. I just packed up my office and left.\u201d\n\nIt was in writing?\n\n\u201cIt was a written agreement. It was a severance agreement. It said I would do nothing that interfered with anything the hospital association deemed important. I would not speak against the hospital association. I would not speak out on issues they deemed important to them. I wouldn\u2019t bring any lawsuits. The usual kind of things that would have given them unparalleled control over my activities. And, of course, I didn\u2019t even respond.\u201d\n\n\u201cThree weeks later, after I had cleaned out my office and left, I was contacted by the gentleman who fired me. And the offer was increased to about $150,000.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs a lawyer, as you might imagine, I have been involved in more of my share of employee termination situations. I have never terminated someone for cause or for gross insubordination and offered them a penny. Nor have I ever instructed any client to ever do that. It seems stupid, unnecessary and problematic.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter receiving the second offer, I never responded. And so, I did two things. I sued the Council of Health Plans. I lost the lawsuit, but I gained access to thousands of pages of emails and interesting depositions. And I also returned to our state capitol, without employment and constituency. And I began to lobby my issue, acting on behalf of the truth.\u201d\n\n\u201cLegislators were asking \u2014 why do I continue to come to the capitol? And various people gave responses like \u2014 it\u2019s a public building, maybe he doesn\u2019t have anything else to do. He\u2019s out of work.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn early 2011, the smallest of the four HMOs \u2014 UCare \u2014 told the state of Minnesota that they were refunding to the state $30 million. This was described as a donation, because the state was in a budget crisis. When this happened, UCare wrote a letter to certain select legislators on the appropriate oversight committees that deal with HMOs, the Medicaid program and healthcare issues. And in that letter they explained that they were giving back the money because the Medicaid rate that they had been paid had been inflated to compensate them for losses they had incurred in state only funded programs which were not eligible for federal matching dollars. This, together with the statement on the conference call, virtually cemented the notion that this was fraudulent.\u201d\n\nIf we had a unified, single payer health system, would that go a long way to addressing the situation?\n\n\u201cThat would prevent the situation,\u201d Feinwachs said. \u201cThat would be the cure for this disease.\u201d\n\n\u201cGovernment operated systems are frequently bureaucratic and inefficient. Everybody understands that there is a built in inefficiency and difficulty in things the government runs. But given a choice between inefficient and bureaucratic versus corrupt, I will take bureaucratic and inefficient any day of the week.\u201d\n\nFeinwach\u2019s lawsuit against the HMOs was dismissed.\n\nWhy was it dismissed?\n\n\u201cThe gentleman who fired me gave a sworn deposition saying that he suffered no external pressure to fire me,\u201d Feinwachs said. \u201cHe said he made the decision solely and without influence from anyone else. It was entirely his decision. And he said that he fired me because he instructed me specifically to stop investigating or looking into these issues, what I believed to be this fraud. And because I refused to listen to him, he fired me.\u201d\n\nWhat leverage do the HMOs have over the hospitals?\n\n\u201cQuite simply, money,\u201d Feinwachs said. \u201cHospitals are completely dependant on these HMOs for their cash flows. Also, under the Affordable Care Act, they were all doing the dance to partner with these HMOs to form Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs), which are like HMOs on steroids. The HMOs would acquire and merge with large hospital systems to form these new conglomerates.\u201d\n\nDid Feinwachs have this position in favor of single payer while you were general counsel at the Minnesota Hospital Association?\n\n\u201cNot for the first couple of decades,\u201d Feinwachs said. \u201cI came to this view over time watching what was going on and seeing how secretive everything was. And then I began to realize that this is in effect a money machine. I came to that realization slowly. The public doesn\u2019t have a chance. The average person won\u2019t be granted access to inside information nor the luxury of enough time to evaluate it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn this country, if you favor single payer health care, or Medicare for All, you are a socialist, a communist, or some variation of pinko rat bastard that should not be taken seriously. This is America. We have a free market. Okay, if we have a free market, why do I live in a state where I am forced to buy insurance from four companies that I despise? How does that fit into anybody\u2019s world view of a free market?\u201d\n\nObamacare was written by the insurance industry to protect itself against single payer, correct?\n\n\u201cYou bet it was,\u201d Feinwachs said. \u201cThe single biggest mistake that the Obama administration made was involving insurance companies. When the President was elected, he had a mandate from the people to reform health care and to provide healthcare for all. He fumbled it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Affordable Care Act will be remembered as one of the great pieces of legislation of the last 100 years. But he let these insurers back into the game. He let them run it. That is akin to letting the mafia operate the banking system. It isn\u2019t going to end well.\u201d\n\nDo you know of any other general counsel of any state hospital association who agrees with you?\n\n\u201cNo. And if I did, I\u2019m sure none of them would utter it aloud. There is an old Greek proverb \u2014 he who speaks the truth best keep one foot in the stirrup.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you are within the system, you play the game. At some point, every once in a while, somebody decides \u2014 enough is enough. If nothing else, I\u2019d like to be remembered as the guy who didn\u2019t take the money and spoke out.\u201d\n\n[For the complete q/a transcript of the Interview with David Feinwachs, 28 Corporate Crime Reporter 41(8), October 27, 2014, print edition only.]", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Corporate Crime Reporter", "description": "David Feinwachs was general counsel for the Minnesota Hospital Association.
