And, at least as of two years ago, there was little sign of recovery.\n\nThat distressing news is contained in a report released this morning by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis and the National Endowment for the Arts. It finds that, for 2011, \u201cthe value added from arts and cultural production accounted for nearly 3.2 percent, or $504 billion,\u201d of the nation\u2019s Gross Domestic Product (GDP), a common gauge of economic activity.\n\nThat figure was in the 3.5 to 3.7 percent range in the first half of the 2000s. It dipped to 3.2 percent in 2009, and has been stuck there ever since.\n\nThat still represents a significant slice of the overall economy. In 2011, two million Americans were employed in the arts and culture category, including 310,000 in the motion-picture industry, and 100,000 each for museums and the performing arts.\n\nBut employment levels in this sector took a real dive in 2009\u2014much greater than the economy as a whole\u2014and had yet to fully recover as of 2011. Employment in cultural production (as broadly defined by the federal government) declined roughly one percent from 2010 to 2011\u2014a much smaller figure than the previous few years, but still on the negative side of the ledger.", "article_metadata": {"description": "New NEA report finds that in the wake of the recession, the arts represent a shrinking portion of our GDP", "title": "Study: America\u2019s culture economy is doomed", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "New NEA report finds that in the wake of the recession, the arts represent a shrinking portion of our GDP", "title": "Study: America\u2019s culture economy is doomed", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2013/12/08/how_the_recession_killed_culture_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/12/shutterstock_144811777.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "New NEA report finds that in the wake of the recession, the arts represent a shrinking portion of our GDP", "title": "Study: America\u2019s culture economy is doomed", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/12/shutterstock_144811777.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Tom Jacobs", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Art, Culture, GDP, Mad Men, NEA, Pacific Standard, peggy olson", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfec6\"", "article_summary": "Topics: Art, Culture, GDP, Mad Men, NEA, Pacific Standard, peggy olson, Business News, Entertainment News, NewsThis piece originally appeared on Pacific Standard.\nPretty much every sector of the economy was battered during the great recession, but the artistic and creative community suffered more than most.\nBut employment levels in this sector took a real dive in 2009\u2014much greater than the economy as a whole\u2014and had yet to fully recover as of 2011.\nIn 2011, two million Americans were employed in the arts and culture category, including 310,000 in the motion-picture industry, and 100,000 each for museums and the performing arts.\nThat figure was in the 3.5 to 3.7 percent range in the first half of the 2000s."}
