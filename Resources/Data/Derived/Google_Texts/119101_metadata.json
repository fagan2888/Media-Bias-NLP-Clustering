It\u2019s been notoriously difficult to tackle: The last three Congresses have tried and failed to rewrite it. Education policy wonks and observers are so pessimistic, they\u2019ve declared it will never be updated, though it\u2019s already seven years overdue for a rewrite and considered broken by those on the left and the right.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nBut Sens. Lamar Alexander and Patty Murray, one the son of a teacher and the other a former teacher, have quickly forged a formidable working relationship in the new Congress that is lifting the spirits of even the most discouraged observers. The HELP Committee unanimously passed its rewrite of the education bill on Thursday afternoon, with the polarizing Sens. Rand Paul, Tim Scott, Al Franken and Elizabeth Warren all lined up behind the committee chairs.\n\nEarlier in the week, Franken told Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) in the Senate subway he thinks the committee\u2019s progress was the byproduct of having committee leaders who truly know what they are doing, Whitehouse said. The under-the-radar progress is one small sign of hope for bipartisanship in the new Senate, which also passed a fix to Medicare payments this week in another bipartisan victory.\n\nBut it might not have turned out this way.\n\nIn fact, the year started quite differently. Alexander unveiled a Republican draft of what he\u2019d like to see in the law and was holding meetings with moderate Democrats, including former governors who might throw their support behind a bill that gives power over education back to the states, to discuss NCLB. He frequently spoke of moving a bill through the Senate and picking up Democratic support along the way to make it bipartisan enough to yield 60 votes \u2014 a far cry from the tight relationship between committee leaders on display this week.\n\nBut Murray, newly in the minority and new to the ranking member post, had her own plan that she brought to Alexander: The two should step behind closed doors and negotiate a bill together. Though Murray wasn\u2019t in control of the committee, she could help bring along the White House down the line \u2014 and help sell House Democrats on a bill, too.\n\n\u201cI listened to her; I took her advice, and it was good advice,\u201d Alexander said.\n\nAnd so the two took a classic schoolyard lesson into the Senate: Play nice with others.\n\nSoon committee aides were working seven days a week to lay out a way ahead for NCLB, huddling over shared pizza and grub from Shake Shack. The two parties\u2019 visions for the law were miles apart: Alexander preferred handing control over education back to states, leaving it up to them how to deal with standardized tests and poorly performing schools. Murray wanted stronger federal powers to ensure students \u2014 especially low-income, minority, and disabled students \u2014 were being well-served by their schools. Alexander was eager to include school choice provisions that allowed federal money to follow low-income students from school to school, while Murray and the Obama administration were firm they wanted the law to incorporate more early education.\n\nNegotiations were private \u2014 but a cacophony was building outside. The country\u2019s largest teachers union launched a major ad buy in February while senators were home for recess to pressure HELP Committee members to dump of the law\u2019s annual testing mandate. Education Secretary Arne Duncan and civil rights groups were tugging from the opposite side, demanding the law retain its yearly testing regime and do more to ensure states and schools focus on educating low-income students.\n\nAnd in the House, the tea party reared its head. Conservative lawmakers, the Heritage Foundation and the Club for Growth mounted opposition to the House\u2019s bill the week it was supposed to be put up for a vote, eventually derailing the bill from a floor vote at the end of February.\n\nThe senators rounded their next base \u2014 preschool \u2014 the following week as Washington braced for early spring snow and both HELP Committee leaders attended the contentious King v. Burwell Obamacare arguments at the Supreme Court. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, angry about a school choice provision in the House\u2019s partisan bill, also attended.\n\nThe trip to the Supreme Court got Alexander thinking about how to work through the divisive pre-K issue, a GOP aide said. He didn\u2019t want to add new federal programs to the bill, but Murray and President Barack Obama had been clear the issue was paramount. So he and Murray huddled with aides in Murray\u2019s hideaway in the Capitol and came up with a way to handle the issue: Pass it off to Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.).\n\nAP Photo\n\nIsakson, who is passionate about early education, had negotiated with Murray in the past. He and the Washington senator set to work and eventually hammered out an agreement. The bill released by the Senate included some early education provisions and a grant program helping expand preschool in states was added during the markup as an amendment. It had Alexander\u2019s vote.\n\nOther elements of the bill were also falling into place, but a litany of issues related to the way states measure and improve school performance were \u201ca moving target,\u201d a Democratic aide said. Soon after the pre-K agreement, however, compromises and trades on other pieces of the bill emerged.\n\nSoon the committee leaders were pulling in their colleagues, who had been shut out of the negotiations, to discuss the other \u2014 for the most part, less divisive \u2014 parts of the bill. Senators lined up behind Murray and Alexander, who put in time listening to their ideas for the law. By the time the lawmakers returned from Easter recess, they had a deal: a bill that would keep NCLB\u2019s annual testing requirement but strip out much of the federal accountability that has led to cries of executive overreach from Republicans. Many existing federal programs and rules are gone, but guidelines designed to keep states in line are written into the text to please Democrats.\n\nThe unanimous vote on the bill in committee Thursday reflects HELP Committee member\u2019s faith in the way Alexander and Murray have gone about tackling NCLB. It doesn\u2019t mean they still don\u2019t have serious qualms about the bill: Several Democrats including Warren, Franken and Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) were clear Thursday that they have serious concerns with the way the bill handles accountability and would prefer it have a stronger federal role from a civil rights standpoint. Civil rights groups feel the same way and could mount opposition.\n\nConservatives, meanwhile, were mostly silent during the markup about their preference for stronger school choice provisions as Alexander led the show \u2014 but they have said they plan to get more involved as it heads to the floor.\n\nAlexander credited the Republican Senate\u2019s more open amendment process for helping the markup run smoothly, because senators will get to make their case for their proposals in front of a bigger audience on the Senate floor. Franken, for example, has decided to hold off on a vote for an amendment aiming to reduce bullying of LGBT youth that was controversial among Republicans, especially given the recent fights over Indiana\u2019s religious freedom law. And Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) said he\u2019ll wait to bring up Title I portability \u2014 a school choice measure that Democrats liken to school vouchers that would have been a poison pill.\n\n\u201cWe might not have gotten to the floor if either one had been offered,\u201d Alexander said.\n\nAlexander and Murray are closely tied to Senate leadership, which could help make their education bill a priority for the chamber. Alexander held a leadership post in the Senate before stepping down to do legislative work and is close with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Murray holds the No. 4 post in the Senate and has become a talked-about potential whip after Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid announced his retirement in March.\n\nOn the floor, the bullying and school choice amendments will face the Senate\u2019s 60-vote threshold, which helps neutralize the possibility that they\u2019ll derail Alexander and Murray\u2019s carefully crafted compromise bill.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been through this,\u201d Murray said. \u201cIt takes a lot of work to get a bill all the way to the president. There\u2019s a lot of work left.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "How Lamar Alexander and Patty Murray came together to fix No Child Left Behind.", "title": "The Shake Shack summit that saved the education bill", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/04/nclb-bill-alexander-murray-and-shake-shack-117094.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2015/04/17/lede_150417_alexander_murray_ap-2.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Shake Shack,Congress,Senate,Education,No Child Left Behind,Patty Murray,Lamar Alexander", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "How Lamar Alexander and Patty Murray came together to fix No Child Left Behind.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3819\"", "article_summary": "The HELP Committee unanimously passed its rewrite of the education bill on Thursday afternoon, with the polarizing Sens.\nAlexander and Murray are closely tied to Senate leadership, which could help make their education bill a priority for the chamber.\nThe unanimous vote on the bill in committee Thursday reflects HELP Committee member\u2019s faith in the way Alexander and Murray have gone about tackling NCLB.\nThe bill includes toxic education topics like testing and school performance ratings.\nSoon committee aides were working seven days a week to lay out a way ahead for NCLB, huddling over shared pizza and grub from Shake Shack."}
