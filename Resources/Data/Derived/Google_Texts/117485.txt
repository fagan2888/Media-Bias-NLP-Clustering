Small, independently owned businesses across the nation saw an increase in customers and sales Saturday.

Small Business Saturday was a term coined years ago, but the message was clear; shop local stores to support the local economy and community.

Business in Wichita's Old Town District saw an increase in sales. Rebecca Simpson owns Rebecca's, a store in Old Town and expects to see up to a 25% increase in business.

"When you spend money at a local business, a lot more of that money goes back out to the community," said store owner Valerie Reimers. She owns Lucinda's, a clothing and gift store in Old Town.

The big selling items were gifts that are unique to Wichita, such as artwork, jewelry and decorations.
