Bartheld had apparently been dead for several days.\n\nInvestigators don\u2019t believe that there is any danger to the public, Chaffee County sheriff\u2019s patrol Cmdr. Derek Bos said. \u201cWe do feel there was a very specific motive; however, we don\u2019t feel there is any threat to the public or even a targeted person.\u201d\n\nInitial observations suggested he died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, but authorities changed their minds after discovering a large cache of explosive devices and chemicals commonly used for manufacturing explosives.\n\n\u201cWe believe it was an accidental explosion that killed him\u201d at the home near Salida, said Bos.\n\nA widower, Bartheld lived alone. Public records show that his wife, Jean Therese Bartheld, died in 2012.\n\nBartheld hadn\u2019t completed building the bombs when he died, Bos said.\n\n\u201cHe was still in the manufacturing process, which is one reason we believe it was an accident. Had he finished the process, there would have been a bigger explosion,\u201d Bos said.\n\nDeputies and investigators left the home after discovering the explosives and called for the Colorado Springs Regional Explosives Unit and other hazardous materials teams.\n\n\u201cOn Saturday, members of the bomb squad and HazMat teams located large quantities of chemicals used for manufacturing explosives, along with several homemade detonators and homemade explosives inside the house.\n\n\u201cThe explosives were removed and safely detonated by the specialists while HazMat team members identified chemicals and mixtures to assure they were stable prior to their removal from the house,\u201d the release said.\n\nTurret is \u201ckind of a resuscitated ghost town,\u201d Bos said. \u201cThere\u2019s quite a few people who live there. It is like most ghost towns; everything is a mining claim and they build houses on the claims.\u201d Bos estimated that about 50 people live in the town.\n\nThe community is on Route 184, a gravel road, about 13 miles north of Salida.\n\nBos wouldn\u2019t elaborate on a motive, saying that the case remains under investigation. An autopsy Monday will determine the cause of Bartheld\u2019s death.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "92-year-old Chaffee man making bombs appears to have died in explosion", "title": "92-year-old Chaffee man making bombs appears to have died in explosion", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/09/14/92-year-old-chaffee-man-making-bombs-appears-to-have-died-in-explosion/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140915__ps93E8p1.jpg", "height": 371}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140915__ps93E8p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-14T13:28:05+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T05:07:52+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Bartheld hadn\u2019t completed building the bombs when he died, Bos said.\nPublic records show that his wife, Jean Therese Bartheld, died in 2012.\nInvestigators don\u2019t believe that there is any danger to the public, Chaffee County sheriff\u2019s patrol Cmdr.\n\u201cOn Saturday, members of the bomb squad and HazMat teams located large quantities of chemicals used for manufacturing explosives, along with several homemade detonators and homemade explosives inside the house.\nDeputies and investigators left the home after discovering the explosives and called for the Colorado Springs Regional Explosives Unit and other hazardous materials teams."}
