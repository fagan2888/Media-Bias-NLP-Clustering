OMD New York has won gold in both the Clio Awards Branded Content and Branded Entertainment categories for its "Fallonventions" campaign for GE, in which the Tonight Show host does seven- to eight-minute live segments in which kid inventors demonstrate their new products.

The three on-air segments, and additional Web-only material, "were the highest-rated in terms of brand integration throughout Jimmy's first season," Laura Correnti, group account director at The Grid (the partnership between OMD and Giant Spoon that created the campaign) told Adweek recently.

Check out that work below, along with other winners in the two categories.

Clio is announcing all gold, silver and bronze winners this week. Grand Clios will be announced at the Sept. 30 awards gala, which will be held at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City. (Adweek and the Clio Awards are both owned by affiliates of Mediabistro Holdings LLC.)
