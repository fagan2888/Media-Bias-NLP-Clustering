Since then, Reiber, now 53, has worked successfully to keep his high blood pressure in check through exercise, diet and medication.\n\nFor most adults, a diagnosis of hypertension comes in pretty much the same way as Reiber\u2019s, and the treatment for it falls pretty much along the same straightforward path.\n\nHowever, treating hypertension in people ages 60 and older can be a bit trickier because of the cumulative effects of aging, a patient universe that tends to be managing more than one medical condition and taking multiple medications in doing so, and the potentially hazardous side effects some hypertension medications can bring to older patients.\n\nLate last year, a national panel released proposed new guidelines for treating hypertension in people ages 60 and older, setting a new \u2014 some would argue looser or less aggressive \u2014 blood pressure target point for seniors.\n\nSome physicians, nurses and clinicians disagree with the proposal, citing the potentially deadly health risks hypertension can pose.\n\nBlood pressure is a measurement of the pressure circulating blood places on the walls of the body\u2019s blood vessels. It\u2019s expressed in the form of two numbers, systolic pressure and diastolic pressure. The unit of measurement for both is millimeters of mercury, and it\u2019s often referred to in terms of \u201csomething-over-something.\u201d\n\nThe systolic pressure, the top number, denotes the pressure in the arteries when the heart beats or contracts, says Pat Alpert, an advanced practice registered nurse and associate professor and chair of the physiological department at the UNLV School of Nursing.\n\nThen, the bottom number, or diastolic pressure, denotes the pressure in the blood vessels when the heart is relaxing between beats, Alpert says.\n\nNormal blood pressure is considered to be 120 over 80 or lower. Blood pressures higher than that are described in stages of hypertension. According to the American Heart Association, the stages are: prehypertension (systolic of 120 to 139 or diastolic of 80 to 89), stage 1 hypertension (systolic of 140 to 159 or diastolic of 90 to 99), stage 2 hypertension (systolic of 160 or higher or diastolic of 100 or higher), and \u201chypertensive crisis,\u201d when emergency assistance is necessary (systolic higher than 180 or diastolic higher than 110).\n\nHypertension often is called \u201cthe silent killer.\u201d It usually presents no visible symptoms and is discovered only through a blood-pressure check during a health screening. However, left untreated, the immediate or cumulative effects of high blood pressure are associated with a frightening roster of serious conditions that include stroke, heart problems and kidney disease.\n\nBlood pressure can rise with age as the body\u2019s blood vessels lose elasticity and a lifetime\u2019s accumulation of arterial plaque takes its toll. Dr. Matthew Martin, assistant director of the family medicine residency program at Valley Hospital and assistant professor at Touro University Nevada College of Osteopathic Medicine, says, in the past, the general target for geriatric patients has been to maintain blood pressure below 140 over 90.\n\nWith the proposed new guidelines, he says, \u201cwhat we\u2019re suggesting now is perhaps, in this geriatric population, that we want to loosen our control a bit.\u201d\n\nSo, for otherwise healthy people 60 and older who don\u2019t have diabetes, kidney disease or other medical issues, the proposed guidelines move slightly upward \u2014 from the current 140 over 90 to 150 over 90 \u2014 the point at which medications would be prescribed to treat hypertension.\n\nThe new guidelines are based on a review of hypertension treatment outcomes in seniors and reflect a balancing of the potential risks, the potential benefits and the effectiveness of aggressively treating hypertension in older patients. Among the issues the committee considered is that some of the medications prescribed for hypertension can cause dizziness or lightheadedness, and that can lead to falls in a particularly vulnerable group of patients.\n\n\u201cOne of the biggest contributors for death in that (senior) population is falls,\u201d Martin says. \u201cIf one gets lightheaded and falls, the risk of fracture and pneumonia when lying on the back while recuperating, those go up.\u201d\n\nAnother potential issue: Older people already might be taking other prescription medications that can interact with blood-pressure medications, and adding another medication into the pharmacological mix can cause unwanted side effects and interactions.\n\nAmong seniors, \u201cit\u2019s not uncommon that they have multiple illnesses,\u201d Alpert says. \u201cIt\u2019s not uncommon to be on 10, 11, 12 medications, so the more medications you take \u2026 you tend to run the risk of having side effects. And. it\u2019s not uncommon to see people on two or three hypertension medications.\u201d\n\nMartin stresses that the proposed guidelines are only that: guidelines that front-line health care providers can take into account when treating individual senior patients. The guidelines \u201chelp us make informed clinical decisions,\u201d he adds, but they don\u2019t \u201coverride good decision-making.\n\n\u201cSo if there were persons with certain conditions where lower blood pressure is indicated, we may shoot for that, and that\u2019s something you may want to discuss with your doctor. On the other hand, if (a patient has) other symptoms \u2014 (such as) lightheadedness \u2014 then, certainly, we can re-address the blood-pressure goals.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe do know that lower blood pressures are generally healthier,\u201d says Dr. Lisa Rosenberg, a geriatrician with Touro University Nevada. \u201cBut in older adults, you have to be aware of other issues. Maybe muscles are weakened. Maybe there are balance issues, and that makes the risk of lowering blood pressure much more dangerous because they may fall and sustain injury.\u201d\n\nUnder the proposed change, she says, when a patient\u2019s unique medical needs call for it, \u201cwe can kind of let that blood pressure be higher than the previous guidelines would have led us to believe.\u201d\n\nThe proposed guidelines haven\u2019t been universally embraced. Some physicians \u2014 including, even, some members of the panel that worked on the guidelines \u2014 have opposed their adoption, citing the significant risks hypertension poses and, Alpert says, \u201cuncertainty\u201d about the validity of the data used to formulate the new guidelines.\n\n\u201cI think people are a little hesitant,\u201d she says. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a 100 percent buy-in from all of the experts, so that makes it a little iffy.\u201d\n\nHowever, the proposed guidelines at least should prompt greater dialogue between physician and patient. For example, Rosenberg says, if a patient \u201ccalls back and says, \u2018I took the new medication, and I was dizzy,\u2019 then my answer is always, \u2018That\u2019s the wrong medication for you.\u2019\n\n\u201cI have had, in my own experience when I was training, (a cardiologist say), \u2018The best blood pressure for anybody is the lowest blood pressure they can tolerate without getting dizzy and falling down.\u2019 But that\u2019s not the way we think about it anymore.\u201d\n\nMartin says the proposed guidelines reflect a reality front-line physicians commonly see. He recalls that, while presenting a review of the guidelines to a group of physicians, \u201cas I looked around the room, I saw many heads nodding. It\u2019s something physicians have known for a while.\u201d\n\nThe important thing, Martin adds, is to not \u201cmake this a blanket statement for every patient.\u201d\n\nAnd for patients, he says, the key takeaway is to \u201cnever make a medication change without consulting your doctor.\u201d\n\nThat, Alpert notes, is one of the fears expressed by opponents of the new guidelines: That \u201cwhen people read this, they\u2019ll say, \u2018I no longer have to take my meds because my blood pressure is 148 over 90.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThat can bring serious consequences.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t tell you how many patients who have come in with congestive heart failure tell me they were told 10 years ago that their blood pressure is a little high and they should see a provider, and they didn\u2019t really feel so bad, so they didn\u2019t see someone,\u201d Alpert says.\n\nThe proposed guidelines also may help to direct a sharper focus on lifestyle changes that can help to manage hypertension. Reiber \u2014 who\u2019s also a UNLV biology professor and researcher in cardiovascular physiology \u2014 says he \u201cbecame concerned\u201d about his blood pressure when a routine exam placed it at nearly 180 over 100.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s really bad,\u201d he says, and while stress was a factor, \u201cI also had put on weight. I was up to around 220 and I shouldn\u2019t run more than 175.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey put me on meds, but I also decided that exercise and diet had to be a more aggressive part of my life,\u201d Reiber says. He started exercising daily and altered his diet, in part by substituting chicken, fish and vegetables for beef. The last time his blood pressure was taken, it was about 130 over 75.\n\nReiber\u2019s is a lesson anybody who is concerned about his or her blood pressure should take to heart.\n\n\u201cWith obesity, blood pressure goes up,\u201d Rosenberg explains, and losing just five or 10 pounds \u201ccan take a lot of pressure off of the blood vessels, and the heart has to do much less work to circulate the blood.\u201d\n\nContact reporter John Przybys at jprzybys@reviewjournal.com or 702-383-0280.", "article_metadata": {"parsely-link": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/life/health/some-medical-professionals-having-trouble-taking-new-criteria-heart", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "JOHN PRZYBYS LAS VEGAS REVIEW-JOURNAL", "parsely-title": "Some medical professionals having trouble taking new criteria to heart", "parsely-image-url": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_web3-BLOOD-PRESSURE-ILLO6.jpg", "twitter": {"description": "Like about 76 million other Americans, Carl Reiber has hypertension.", "creator": {"identifier": "@reviewjournal", "id": 15358759}, "url": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/life/health/some-medical-professionals-having-trouble-taking-new-criteria-heart", "image": {"src": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_web3-BLOOD-PRESSURE-ILLO6.jpg, http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_BLOOD-PRESSURE-ILLO7.jpg, http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_BLOOD2-PRESSURE-ILLO-final.jpg"}, "title": "Some medical professionals having trouble taking new criteria to heart", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-pub-date": "2014-07-07T05:50:15Z", "vf": {"unique_id": "reviewjournal-nid-1894341"}, "al": {"web": {"should_fallback": "true"}, "android": {"url": "review-journal://?eid=1569866", "app_name": "review-journal", "package": "com.LVRJ"}, "ios": {"url": "review-journal://?eid=1569866", "app_store_id": 540820524, "app_name": "review-journal"}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=540820524", "fb": {"admins": 630759385, "app_id": 195491203833571}, "google-play-app": "app-id=com.LVRJ", "parsely-author": "JOHN PRZYBYS LAS VEGAS REVIEW-JOURNAL", "parsely-section": "Health", "keywords": "Health,Life,", "parsely-type": "post", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-06T22:50:15-07:00"}, "parsely-tags": "Health,Life", "og": {"site_name": "Las Vegas Review-Journal", "description": "Like about 76 million other Americans, Carl Reiber has hypertension.", "title": "Some medical professionals having trouble taking new criteria to heart", "url": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/life/health/some-medical-professionals-having-trouble-taking-new-criteria-heart", "image": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_web3-BLOOD-PRESSURE-ILLO6.jpg", "type": "article"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=0.9", "description": "Like about 76 million other Americans, Carl Reiber has hypertension."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcee3b\"", "article_summary": "Blood pressure is a measurement of the pressure circulating blood places on the walls of the body\u2019s blood vessels.\nReiber\u2019s is a lesson anybody who is concerned about his or her blood pressure should take to heart.\nSince then, Reiber, now 53, has worked successfully to keep his high blood pressure in check through exercise, diet and medication.\nIt\u2019s expressed in the form of two numbers, systolic pressure and diastolic pressure.\nBlood pressure can rise with age as the body\u2019s blood vessels lose elasticity and a lifetime\u2019s accumulation of arterial plaque takes its toll."}
