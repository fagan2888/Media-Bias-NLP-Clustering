But I will say this, Anderson. If we don\u2019t do something quickly you\u2019re going to have a health care that you \u2014 like you\u2019ve never seen before in this country.\n\nNow, the new plan is good. It\u2019s going to be inexpensive. It\u2019s going to be much better for the people. But there\u2019s going to a group of people at the bottom \u2014 people that haven\u2019t done well. People that don\u2019t have any money that won\u2019t be able to be care of.\n\nWe\u2019re going to take care of them through maybe concepts of Medicare. We have hospitals that aren\u2019t doing well, we have doctors that aren\u2019t doing well. You cannot let people die on the street, OK?\n\nNow, some people would say, \u2018that\u2019s not a very Republican thing to say.\u2019 Every time I say this at a rally, or even today, I said it \u2014 once, it got a standing ovation.\n\nI said, you know, the problem is everybody thinks that you people, as Republicans, hate the concept of taking care of people that are really, really sick and are gonna die.\n\nThat\u2019s not single payer, by the way. That\u2019s called heart. We gotta take care of people that can\u2019t take care of themselves. But the plans will be much less expensive than Obamacare, they\u2019ll be far better than Obamacare, you\u2019ll get your doctor, you\u2019ll get everything that you want to get. It\u2019ll be unbelievable.\n\nBut you\u2019ve gotta get rid of the lines. You gotta have competition. Those people that are left \u2014 we\u2019ve gotta help them live. And everybody likes it when I say it, and that includes Republicans. And it\u2019s not single payer.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Donald Trump: Healthcare Plan 'Not Called Single Payer,' It's 'Called Heart'", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Donald Trump: Healthcare Plan 'Not Called Single Payer,' It's 'Called Heart'", "title": "Donald Trump: Healthcare Plan 'Not Called Single Payer,' It's 'Called Heart' - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/02/GettyImages-511247208.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/02/18/3081581/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Donald Trump: Healthcare Plan 'Not Called Single Payer,' It's 'Called Heart'", "title": "Donald Trump: Healthcare Plan 'Not Called Single Payer,' It's 'Called Heart' - Breitbart", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/02/GettyImages-511247208.jpg", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Donald Trump, healthcare, obamacare,2016 Presidential Race, Big Government, Obamacare,Trump", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "tag": "obamacare", "published_time": "2016-02-18T21:08:17-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,2016 Presidential Race,Obamacare"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "But you\u2019ve gotta get rid of the lines.\nNow, some people would say, \u2018that\u2019s not a very Republican thing to say.\u2019 Every time I say this at a rally, or even today, I said it \u2014 once, it got a standing ovation.\nIf we don\u2019t do something quickly you\u2019re going to have a health care that you \u2014 like you\u2019ve never seen before in this country.\nThat\u2019s not single payer, by the way.\nTrump criticized people who think \u201cRepublicans hate the concept of taking care of people.\u201d But \u201cwe\u2019re going to take care of them through maybe concepts of Medicare,\u201d he told the CNN host, Anderson Cooper."}
