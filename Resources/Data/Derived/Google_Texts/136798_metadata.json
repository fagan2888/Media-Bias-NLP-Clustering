Chuck Fleischmann and Chuck Graves, voted for the fiscal year 2016 Omnibus Appropriations bill. The Senate passed it by a vote of 65 to 33. The House passed the bill by a vote of 316 to 113.\n\nSenator Corker said,\n\n\"Left to my own accord this bill would look much different, but it does put to bed a number of issues that have been left unaddressed for a number of years and provides permanent tax relief to American families and businesses,\u201d\n\nRep. Fleischmann said, \"Today we passed a bill that in addition to keeping our government open and functioning will properly fund our military, rein in the IRS and lift the ban on American oil exports. This bill is good for our economy and good for East Tennessee. The Chickamauga Lock will move forward and the vital national security work done in Oak Ridge will continue. As we move into a new year, with new House leadership, I am hopeful that we will continue to advance strong conservative principles.\u201d\n\nRep. Graves said, \u201cThe number one issue for Georgia in this legislation was stopping an assault by other states on our water rights. These other states were trying to use a government funding bill to circumvent the legal process and restrict Georgia\u2019s access to its own water. I\u2019m grateful to every member of the Georgia congressional delegation, Republicans and Democrats, for working around the clock to secure this major victory for our state.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis legislation delivers more hard fought victories for conservatives as we go into the final year of the Obama administration. The bill lifts the 40-year-old ban on U.S. crude oil exports, which will help lock in lower gas prices, create an estimated one million American jobs and grow our economy by $170 billion annually. It tightens security of the Visa Waiver Program so terrorists cannot use our nation\u2019s generosity to sneak in and attack our communities. This legislation also protects hard-working Georgians from tax increases sought by liberal Democrats and the Obama administration. Importantly, we didn\u2019t lose any ground on the major victories we won last year, such as holding EPA funding to its lowest levels since 2008, freezing the budget for most IRS operations and continuing to prohibit new funding for Obamacare, including its program for taxpayer funded bailouts of insurance companies.\n\n\n\n\u201cFinally, this legislation provides our military with the critical resources it needs to defend our nation and destroy terrorist groups like the Islamic State,\u201d Rep. Graves continued. \u201cIt ensures our soldiers are properly equipped and trained today, while investing in new and better technologies to stay ahead of our enemies.\u201d\n\nHe said highlights in the Fiscal Year 2016 funding bill include:\n\n\n\nRepeals the antiquated oil export ban. This provision would end the 1975 ban on the export of American oil. Domestic energy production is booming in the United States, and lifting the ban will help create jobs, grow our economy, and promote greater exploration of our natural resources.\n\n\n\nIncreases resources for our military. The arbitrary spending cuts in the sequester have depleted the resources our armed forces need to carry out their mission. This bill restores funding for our military to ensure our troops can confront today\u2019s challenges and defeat the Islamic State.\n\n\n\nStrengthens the Visa Waiver Program to protect the homeland. The Visa Waiver Program presents one of the most urgent threats to our homeland from radical Islamic terrorism. This agreement includes the House-passed bill to tighten the security requirements under the program. It would also deny visa waiver status to any individual who has traveled to certain terrorist hotspots, including Syria and Iraq, in the last five years.\n\nProhibits new funding for Obamacare. The bill contains no new funding for Obamacare and continues to prevent a taxpayer bailout of Obamacare\u2019s risk corridor program.\n\n\n\nPrevents the transfer of Guantanamo detainees to American soil. The bill prohibits funds from being used to transfer terrorist detainees from Guantanamo Bay to the United States, and prohibits the construction or acquisition of a facility in the U.S. to house detainees.\n\n\n\nBlocks EPA overreach. The bill contains no funding for new or expanded EPA programs, holding the agency to its lowest funding levels since 2008 and its lowest staffing levels since 1989.\n\n\n\nReins in the IRS. The IRS continues to act with impunity against the interests of hardworking taxpayers. This bill freezes most IRS operations and maintains budget cuts necessary to ensure this agency roots out wasteful spending and redirects resources to serving the American people. In addition, the tax extenders package also includes a measure to prohibit the IRS from unfairly imposing the gift tax on contributions to non-profit groups, which have historically been exempt, to encourage donations to these important organizations.\n\n\n\nIncreases protections for life. The bill includes a new prohibition on genetic modification of human embryos, and cuts funding for a program involved in abortion-related activities, the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), by 7 percent. This bill maintains important pro-life provisions, including the Hyde Amendment, and prohibits taxpayer funding for abortion.\n\n\n\nHonors our commitment to our veterans. This bill ensures our veterans receive their much-deserved health benefits, speeds up VA claims processing, prioritizes modernizing the VA\u2019s electronic health care record system, and tightens oversight of construction projects.\n\n\n\nProvides critical healthcare benefits for 9/11 first responders. More than 30,000 first responders continue to suffer from injuries or illnesses sustained during the 9/11 attacks. The bill contains a bipartisan measure to permanently reauthorize critical health care benefits for these brave men and women\u2014and it does so in a fiscally responsible way.\n\nRepeals harmful labeling requirements on American meat. The bill repeals mandatory country-of-origin labeling (COOL) requirements, ensuring that our economy does not suffer more than $1 billion in trade penalties.\n\nEnhances privacy protections. The bill addressed privacy concerns about the Cyber Information Sharing Act by removing Section 407, which would have increased the federal government\u2019s role in creating \u201ccybersecurity strategies\u201d for the private sector.\n\nIncludes conservative victories from last year\u2019s funding bill. The Fiscal Year 2016 appropriations bill also includes the following conservative wins from last year\u2019s funding bill:\n\n\n\n\u00b7 The EPA funding cut of $60 million was continued, making it a 21% budget cut since Fiscal Year 2010. The EPA\u2019s staffing level is at its lowest level since 1989.\n\n\u00b7 The EPA is prohibited from regulating the lead content in ammunition or fishing tackle.\n\nLivestock producers are exempt from EPA greenhouse gas regulations, thwarting the agency\u2019s effort to regulate livestock flatulence.\n\n\u00b7 The Army Corps of Engineers is prohibited from regulating farm ponds and irrigation ditches.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00b7 Aid to Libya is prohibited until the U.S. Secretary of State confirms that the Libyans are cooperating in the Benghazi investigation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00b7 Funding for any future \"Fast and Furious\" type activity is prohibited.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00b7 The UN Arms Trade Treaty cannot be funded or implemented.\n\nSenator Alexander said, \u201cFor those concerned about the federal debt, which includes me, this is not the part of the budget driving the federal debt. This one-third of the budget is rising at about the rate of inflation. It\u2019s the other roughly two-thirds\u2014mandatory entitlement spending\u2014that\u2019s sky-rocketing out of control. Sen. Corker and I have proposed legislation that would reduce the growth of mandatory entitlement spending.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis appropriations bill includes new funding for several national priorities in Tennessee: rebuilding the Chickamauga Lock; $430 million for the $6.5 billion Uranium Processing Facility at the Y-12 National Security Complex; research and development at Oak Ridge National Laboratory; infrastructure at Ft. Campbell; construction of a new federal courthouse in Nashville which is the federal judiciary\u2019s No.1 national courthouse construction priority; as well as increased funding for dredging the Mississippi River in Memphis.\n\n\u201cFor the first time in six years, the Republican Senate majority moved all 12 appropriations bills to the Senate floor \u2013 all within the spending limits set by the Budget Control Act and the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015\u2013 after careful consideration by the subcommittees and the full appropriations committee. Unfortunately, the Democratic leaders blocked bringing 10 of those bills to the Senate floor, which effectively left 70 other senators out of the deliberation process. This should never happen again.\u201d\n\nThe 2016 Omnibus Appropriations bill includes all 12 appropriations bills, including the Senate Energy and Water Development Appropriations bill, which Senator Alexander drafted.\n\nHe said the bill includes funding for the following national spending priorities in Tennessee:\n\nSufficient funding for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to continue construction of Chickamauga Lock in fiscal year 2016. Based on current estimates for the first three Inland Waterways Trust Fund priorities, there should be up to $29 million available to continue construction on Chickamauga Lock, which is the fourth priority in the list of projects Congress agreed upon. This builds on the $3 million used to restart construction on Chickamauga Lock last year.\n\nAn additional $430 million for the $6.5 billion Uranium Processing Facility at the Y-12 National Security Complex, which will continue to keep this project on time and on budget.\n\n$2.1 million to operate and maintain the Memphis Harbor, McKellar Lake project through the Mississippi River and Tributaries funding.\n\n$2.8 million of construction funding in the Mississippi River and Tributaries construction funding to continue building flood control levees in West Tennessee along the Mississippi River.\n\n$1.24 billion for advanced computing, including both the Office of Science and the National Nuclear Security Administration. The Office of Science\u2019s Advanced Scientific Computing Research Program, which supports the new Summit supercomputer at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, is funded at $621 million. \u201cOnce again, the world\u2019s fastest supercomputer will be at Oak Ridge National Laboratory,\u201d Alexander said.\n\nFunding for nuclear infrastructure at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, including hot cells and isotope production facilities. Many of the isotopes produced at Oak Ridge National Laboratory are not available anywhere else, and are necessary to support medical treatments, oil and gas exploration, and deep-space satellites, among other priorities.\n\nFunding for a new mercury treatment facility in Oak Ridge, and for cleanup of nuclear facilities that are no longer in service.\n\n$12.553 million is included in the bill to construct the U.S. Special Operations Forces Company Headquarters and new classrooms at Ft. Campbell.\n\n$188.4 million to fund the construction of the new federal courthouse in Nashville. The Nashville federal courthouse has been on the Administrative Office of the Courts\u2019 Five-Year Plan for 18 years and ranks No. 1 on the federal judiciary\u2019s nationwide priority list.\n\n$70 million to operate and maintain the following navigation projects: Wolf River Harbor, the Tennessee River, and the seven locks and dams located in Tennessee.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.chattanoogan.com/2015/12/18/314668/Corker-Alexander-Fleischmann-Graves.aspx", "article": {"section": "Breaking News", "published_time": "2015-12-18T23:00:49.6879732Z", "modified_time": "2015-12-18T23:12:51.4079788Z"}, "type": "article", "title": "Corker, Alexander, Fleischmann, Graves Support Omnibus Spending Bill"}}, "article_summary": "This should never happen again.\u201dThe 2016 Omnibus Appropriations bill includes all 12 appropriations bills, including the Senate Energy and Water Development Appropriations bill, which Senator Alexander drafted.\nFriday, December 18, 2015Senators Bob Corker and Lamar Alexander, as well as Reps.
