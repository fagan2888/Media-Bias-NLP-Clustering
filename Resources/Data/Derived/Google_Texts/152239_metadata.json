It\u2019s now at 90 million, the highest level since the Labor Department began tracking such data for the Truman administration in the late 1940s. Meanwhile, Reuters reported Aug. 21 that fully three-fourths of all jobs created this year are part-time positions, with full-time jobs a casualty of fears by employers of the coming ruinous cost of Obamacare.\n\nIf Mr. Obama\u2019s sunshine-and-lollipops assertions about the economy were all true, the nation wouldn\u2019t have to spend so much on food stamps. The dole has grown from 26.3 million recipients at a cost of $30.4 billion in 2007 to 46.6 million recipients at a cost of $74.6 billion in 2012. The Agriculture Department figures represent compound annual growth rates of 12 percent and 20 percent, respectively, with most of the growth happening on Mr. Obama\u2019s watch.\n\nA proposal by Republicans on the House Agriculture Committee to cut the soaring rate of growth in the food-stamp program by $40 billion over the next 10 years has met howls of outrage on the left. Democratic campaign commercials invoking Charles Dickens will no doubt follow, but Rep. Steve King, Iowa Republican and a senior member of the Agriculture Committee, says the cuts are intended to \u201censure that while you have a safety net, you shouldn\u2019t be giving welfare benefits to people who are able-bodied and capable of getting a job, who just choose to continue to get food stamps when they can actually go and work.\u201d The safety net is not a hammock.\n\nSpending on food stamps and other nutrition-assistance programs would total $764 billion over 10 years at current projections, so the Republicans propose a meager 5 percent reduction. Mr. Obama can\u2019t have it both ways. Either the economy is a disaster and more people will need food stamps, or the rubble has been cleared and there\u2019s nothing wrong with trimming a bit of fat in one of the federal government\u2019s fattest programs.", "article_metadata": {"description": "With his Syrian expedition in jeopardy, President Obama pivoted back to the economy. \"Everything I've done,\" he told ABC News on Sunday, \"has been designed, No. 1, to stabilize the economy, get it growing again, start producing jobs again.\" He used a Rose Garden event on Monday marking the fifth anniversary of the collapse of Lehman Brothers to reiterate the message. \"We've cleared away all the rubble from the financial crisis,\" said the president, \"and we've begun to lay a new foundation for economic growth and prosperity.\" That's news to the millions in the unemployment lines.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/sep/17/editorial-a-safety-net-not-a-hammock/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "With his Syrian expedition in jeopardy, President Obama pivoted back to the economy. \u201cEverything I\u2019ve done,\u201d he told ABC News on Sunday, \u201chas been designed, No. 1, to stabilize the economy, get it growing again, start producing jobs again.\u201d He used a Rose Garden event on Monday marking the fifth anniversary of the collapse of Lehman Brothers to reiterate the message. \u201cWe\u2019ve cleared away all the rubble from the financial crisis,\u201d said the president, \u201cand we\u2019ve begun to lay a new foundation for economic growth and prosperity.\u201d That\u2019s news to the millions in the unemployment lines.", "title": "EDITORIAL: A safety net, not a hammock"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "description": "With his Syrian expedition in jeopardy, President Obama pivoted back to the economy. \"Everything I've done,\" he told ABC News on Sunday, \"has been designed, No. 1, to stabilize the economy, get it gro", "card": "summary", "title": "EDITORIAL: A safety net, not a hammock"}, "Author": "THE WASHINGTON TIMES", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Labor, Politics, Business Finance"}, "article_summary": "The Bureau of Labor Statistics counts the number of Americans who are no longer part of the workforce, a figure that continues to grow under Mr. Obama.\nMr. Obama can\u2019t have it both ways.\nIf Mr. Obama\u2019s sunshine-and-lollipops assertions about the economy were all true, the nation wouldn\u2019t have to spend so much on food stamps.\nSpending on food stamps and other nutrition-assistance programs would total $764 billion over 10 years at current projections, so the Republicans propose a meager 5 percent reduction.\nThe dole has grown from 26.3 million recipients at a cost of $30.4 billion in 2007 to 46.6 million recipients at a cost of $74.6 billion in 2012."}
