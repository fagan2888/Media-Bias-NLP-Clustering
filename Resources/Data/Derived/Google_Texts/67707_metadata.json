(The number varies based on projections.) The state faces another gap of $50 million to $60 million in fiscal year 2017.\n\nThe Shumlin administration attributes the cost increases to an influx of new Medicaid patients in the program, many of whom were previously uninsured.\n\nEven as the gap widens, legislators will study an expansion of a popular subsidized health care program.\n\nAdvocates want to extend Dr. Dynasaur to all children and young adults up to age 26. Currently, only children who are low income are eligible for subsidized medical care under the program. Lawmakers will also review a recently released study assessing the cost of implementing a universal primary care program.\n\nLegislators will also evaluate the efficacy of the so-called all-payer model which would dramatically change the business of health care in Vermont.\n\nMeanwhile, troubles with Vermont Health Connect persist. Blue Cross Blue Shield is asking lawmakers to consider calling for an audit of the state\u2019s health care exchange.\n\nPaying for Medicaid\n\nThere\u2019s a growing consensus among lawmakers that the state-federal Medicaid program is straining other parts of the state budget.\n\nMedicaid represents 31.6 percent of the state\u2019s $5.5 billion budget for fiscal year 2016, according to the Joint Fiscal Office. (Public education eats up 32.5 percent of the pie.)\n\nMedicaid is a health care program for low-income people that is funded by the state and federal government. The state pays a 45 percent match rate for Medicaid expenditures, and the rest is picked up by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. (In some instances, the federal match rate is higher.)\n\nThe biggest cost driver is an increase in the number of Vermonters who use Medicaid to pay for health care. The Shumlin administration expanded Medicaid substantially as part of Vermont Health Connect and now about a third of Vermonters receive subisidized medical care.\n\nAt the same time, hospitals and doctors are treating more Medicaid patients, and health care administrators say reimbursements are too low. The reimbursement rate is roughly 60 percent of the full market rate paid by commercial insurance and health care providers say the low rates make it difficult for them to stay in business.\n\nGov. Peter Shumlin said in an interview last month that funding Medicaid is the \u201cbiggest\u201d issue facing the state. He proposed a 0.7 percent payroll tax on all Vermont employers in the 2015 session to increase Medicaid reimbursement rates and fill the projected gap, but he said he won\u2019t float the proposal again in 2016.\n\n\u201cI made a very bold proposal last year to fix the funding system,\u201d Shumlin said. \u201cI gave the right plan, and it was rejected, so we\u2019ll let brighter minds, I guess, try to figure that out. \u2026 I made the case. I pushed it hard. If people have other ideas, I\u2019m all ears. But it\u2019s a problem that\u2019s got to be solved.\u201d\n\nJim Reardon, who retired Oct. 31 from his job as the administration\u2019s top budget writer, said lawmakers have two options for addressing the Medicaid budget gap: raising revenue or cutting services for Medicaid recipients.\n\nSteve Klein, the director of the Joint Fiscal Office, recently explained to lawmakers that a third option is cutting other areas of state government.\n\nShumlin has promised to \u201ccome in with a balanced budget\u201d on Jan. 21 and he has repeatedly said he doesn\u2019t support cutting benefits. In a Nov. 17 news conference, he called it \u201cheartless\u201d to sign up roughly one-third of Vermonters for the Medicaid program and then \u201cnibble away around the edges\u201d at benefits.\n\n\u201cWhen we refuse to pay for it we do two things\u2013we under-reimburse our providers so our doctors and nurses can\u2019t stay in business, and we rob every other agency of state government in order to balance our Medicaid budget,\u201d Shumlin said. \u201cSo this is just not good fiscal policy.\u201d\n\nInstead, the Shumlin administration has proposed a complicated rearrangement of state funds to address the $30 million to $40 million gap for fiscal year 2016, which ends in July, as part of the Budget Adjustment Act that usually passes in January. Lawmakers will also need to build the projected $50 million to $60 million gap into the fiscal year 2017 budget.\n\nSen. Claire Ayer, D-Addison, the chair of the Senate Health And Welfare Committee, said her committee will look at underlying causes for the Medicaid gap \u2014 whether it\u2019s \u201cchronic underbudgeting,\u201d more people on Medicaid, or more services being used.\n\nIn October, budget analysts at the Joint Fiscal Office said the gap was likely a result of poor projections when the state-funded Vermont Health Access Plan, or VHAP, for low-income adults ended and those users moved over to the state-federal Medicaid program because of changes in 2014 under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nAnalysts also say there is a population of people who qualified for Medicaid but were never on VHAP. That\u2019s because the way Medicaid calculates eligibility allows users to take more deductions on income.\n\nAnd the Shumlin administration operated Vermont Health Connect under a federal waiver that allowed people to stay on Medicaid for two years, so there may be some on Medicaid who no longer qualify.\n\nThe latest Joint Fiscal Office estimates show there are about 205,000 Vermonters using a Medicaid program, including the standard program for adults living in poverty, Dr. Dynasaur for kids, pharmacy assistance programs, and programs that allow people to use Medicaid as a secondary insurer. The state\u2019s population is 626,000.\n\nVermont Health Connect audit\n\nThe Shumlin administration met self-imposed deadlines for Vermont Health Connect in May and October, and officials have argued it would cost too much to move to the federal health exchange. Lt. Gov. Phil Scott and House Speaker Shap Smith have both advocated for abandoning the exchange in favor of the federal website.\n\nRep. Bill Lippert, D-Hinesburg, the chair of the House Health Care Committee, said implementing the milestones in 2015 helped maintain progress on Vermont Health Connect, but constituents keep informing him of billing issues, so the committee needs to keep its eye on \u201congoing implementation.\u201d\n\nVermont Health Connect was dysfunctional when it was launched in 2013, and it took two years to fix the glitches at a cost of more than $200 million. The exchange does not include a Small Business Health Options Program, or SHOP, a website for small business enrollment. State officials want the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to approve a waiver that would allow small business customers to continue to enroll directly with the insurers, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont and MVP Healthcare.\n\nMeanwhile, Blue Cross Blue Shield says billing issues persist. Lippert said the House Health Care Committee will look closely at the insurer\u2019s recommendation to commission an independent audit on Vermont Health Connect\u2019s long-term sustainability.\n\nAll-payer model\n\nAct 54, passed in 2015, authorized the Shumlin administration and the Green Mountain Care Board to negotiate with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to set up an all-payer financing model.\n\nThe model would channel all sources of health care funds into one stream, including Medicare, Medicaid and commercial insurance.\n\nThe state wants to use the all-payer model to regulate the cost of the health care system and encourage doctors and hospitals to take care of a block of patients for a set price. The Green Mountain Care Board plans to limit the growth of health care expenditures to 3.5 percent per year.\n\nThe board also wants to make all government programs and commercial insurers pay doctors and hospitals in the same way.\n\nMaryland is the only state that has a similar waiver from the federal government and its all-payer model is applied only to hospitals.\n\nThe Green Mountain Care Board plans to include hospitals and doctors in Vermont\u2019s all-payer system.\n\nAl Gobeille, the chair Green Mountain Care Board, which regulates hospital budgets and health insurance rates, said he wants to have a \u201cterms sheet\u201d for the so-called all-payer waiver by the beginning of the session. A waiver from the federal government, which was to be agreed on in October, has yet to be finalized.\n\nLawmakers hope to scrutinize the deal with the feds during the session.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of concern from the provider community,\u201d said Sen. Claire Ayer, D-Addison, a registered nurse who chairs the Senate Committee on Health and Welfare. \u201cWe don\u2019t know if that\u2019s justified or not. We\u2019d like to know what the details are and how they improve cost, quality, and access.\u201d\n\nUniversal primary care\n\nAct 54 also directed the Shumlin administration to perform a study on how Vermont could provide universal primary care \u2014 including routine doctors\u2019 appointments, mental health treatment, pediatrics, and gynecology.\n\nThe Agency of Administration\u2019s Office of Health Care Reform released an analysis Dec. 16 from Wakley Consulting Group. The study found that paying for all primary care claims would cost Vermont between $220.2 million and $281.9 million in 2017.\n\nUnder a \u201cstatus quo\u201d estimate, insurance companies and government programs spend about $35.14 per member per month on primary care, and patients pay $5.30.\n\nIf patients share 13 percent of primary care costs under a universal primary care plan, Wakley projects that the state would spend $34.94 per member per month, and patients would pay $5.24 per member per month.\n\nIf patients pay nothing for primary care, Wakley projects that Vermont would need to pay $44.01 per member per month for the program because free primary care would be an incentive for more people to use the program.\n\nThe Wakley study also projects how much primary care claims would cost in 2017 if the state used the universal plan to raise reimbursement rates for primary care providers by 10 percent, 25 percent, or 50 percent. The additional costs under several different scenarios are between $22.1 million and $134.7 million.\n\nVermont would need to spend 7 percent to 15 percent on top of the projected claims costs to administer a universal primary care program. Additionally, among other limitations the study cites, Vermonters covered by a universal primary care program would be ineligible for a federal health savings account, unless the state could get some kind of waiver from the federal government.\n\nBudget analysts at the Joint Fiscal Office says the Wakley study is flawed because it only addresses primary care claims, it doesn\u2019t analyze \u201cuncertainty\u201d over how fast primary care costs will go up, and it relies on \u201coutdated\u201d numbers for how many people are on Medicaid.\n\n\u201cIn addition, the report currently says nothing about costs of providing universal primary care beyond 2017,\u201d the Joint Fiscal Office review said. \u201cSome discussion of expected cost growth rates beyond 2017 will be important for policy makers as they contemplate future costs.\u201d\n\nDr. Dynasaur 2.0\n\nHouse Speaker Shap Smith, D-Morristown, has backed a proposal to study whether the state could expand Dr. Dynasaur \u2014 a subsidized health care program for children to all Vermonters under age 27, regardless of income.\n\nIn a preliminary proposal, backers of the Dr. Dynasaur 2.0 plan said it would add 120,000 people to the state-federal program. Financing could include a 2 percent payroll tax on all Vermont employers. Backers of the plan also want to study whether the state could increase reimbursement rates so that doctors and hospitals could afford treat the new patients.\n\nA broad coalition of advocacy groups support studying the proposal. They include the Vermont chapter of Main Street Alliance, the Vermont-NEA, Voices for Vermont\u2019s Children, and the Vermont Public Interest Research Group.\n\nMental health integration\n\nLippert said his committee will hold joint hearings with the House Human Services Committee, to look at better integration of mental health and substance abuse services in the health care system.\n\n\u201cMental health and substance abuse really is part of health care, and an important part of health care,\u201d Lippert said. \u201cI think there\u2019s a recognition more and more that (separating mental health from health care) is not a helpful distinction.\u201d\n\nOn the Senate side, Ayer said she wants to continue addressing the psychiatric nursing shortage at the Vermont Psychiatric Care Hospital in Berlin. The hospital has 25 out of the state\u2019s 49 Level 1 beds for patients with acute psychiatric illnesses.\n\nUnder the Shumlin administration\u2019s proposed budget adjustment, the Department of Mental Health would use $409,960 to increase pay rates to attract and retain psychiatric nurses at the Vermont Psychiatric Care Hospital so that it can stop relying on traveling nurses.\n\nUnder the administration\u2019s proposal, the money is offset by savings the state accrued when one wing of the hospital was closed this summer due to understaffing, and from vacancy savings at designated agencies that couldn\u2019t bill as many patients when they were understaffed.\n\nAyer said she wants to continue evaluating pay incentives for psychiatric nurses and explore whether the state can train advanced practice nurses already in Vermont to work with psychiatric patients.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "medicaid, health care, all-payer, dr. dynasaur, universal primary care, vermont, vermont news, vermont events, vermont press releases", "og": {"site_name": "VTDigger", "description": "Even as the Medicaid gap widens, legislators consider an expansion to the Medicaid program and a new all-payer model that will dramatically change the business of health care in Vermont.", "title": "Session preview 2016: Medicaid, all-payer reform, universal primary care to dominate health care agenda | VTDigger", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Peter-Shumlin-Cassandra-Gekas-11.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-17T14:23:39+00:00", "url": "http://vtdigger.org/2016/01/03/session-preview-2016-medicaid-all-payer-reform-universal-primary-care-to-dominate-health-care-agenda-2/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Even as the Medicaid gap widens, legislators consider an expansion to the Medicaid program and a new all-payer model that will dramatically change the business of health care in Vermont.", "creator": "@erin_vt", "image": "http://i1.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Peter-Shumlin-Cassandra-Gekas-11.jpg?fit=1024%2C683", "title": "Session preview 2016: Medicaid, all-payer reform, universal primary care to dominate health care agenda | VTDigger", "site": "@vtdigger", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "keywords": "Medicaid, health care", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/vtdigger", "section": "Health Care", "tag": "universal primary care", "published_time": "2016-01-03T13:32:53+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-17T14:23:39+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "\u201cMental health and substance abuse really is part of health care, and an important part of health care,\u201d Lippert said.\nLawmakers will also review a recently released study assessing the cost of implementing a universal primary care program.\nEven as the gap widens, legislators will study an expansion of a popular subsidized health care program.\nThe Green Mountain Care Board plans to limit the growth of health care expenditures to 3.5 percent per year.\nBlue Cross Blue Shield is asking lawmakers to consider calling for an audit of the state\u2019s health care exchange."}
