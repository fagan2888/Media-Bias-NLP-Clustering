A $467,700 grant will help at least 90 low-income, older adults get temporary part-time jobs

The Clarion-Ledger reports that the city of Jackson Senior Services Division recently received the money from Senior Service America Inc. to help people in in Hinds, Rankin, Scott and Warren counties.

Almost 90 percent of the money will pay wages and benefits for jobs in the Senior Community Service Employment Program, designed to help unemployed older adults who want to return to work.

They'll be assigned to more than 40 local nonprofit and government agencies, including the Jackson/Hinds Library System, Mississippi Industries for the Blind, Pearl WIN Job Center and the Salvation Army. The older workers also will get on-the-job training to improve their chances in the local job market.
