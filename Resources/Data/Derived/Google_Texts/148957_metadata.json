Jeff Yarbro, D-Nashville, told Tennessee Watchdog in an email Thursday that the State Budget Solutions study is more a reflection of flat state revenue than anything else.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t examined the numbers closely, but I don\u2019t think the state would rank that high in terms of total federal dollars received or even federal dollars per capita,\u201d Yarbro said. \u201cAnother likely factor is that not enough Tennesseans are part of the national economic recovery.\u201d\n\nMore investment in Tennessee, Yarbro said, would help.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s obvious to us that investing in education, job creation, and fighting income inequality would improve our ability to be on sounder financial footing,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to the State Budget Solutions report, only nine states can claim to have 25 percent or less of general revenue paid from the federal government\u2019s coffers. Only one state, North Dakota, has less than 20 percent.\n\nContact Christopher Butler at chris@tennesseewatchdog.org\n\nFollow Tennessee Watchdog and receive regular updates through Facebook and Twitter\n\nLike Watchdog.org?
