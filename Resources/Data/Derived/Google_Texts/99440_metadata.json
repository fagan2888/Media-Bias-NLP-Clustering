While 56 percent agreed that Central American families are trying to keep their kids safe in \"very difficult circumstances,\" another 38 percent said they are \"taking advantage of American good will and really seeking a back door to immigrate to our country.\" And 42 percent said that immigrants are a \"burden on the country\" because \"they take our jobs housing and healthcare\"\u2014a seven-point increase compared to another poll that asked the same question in early July.\n\nHow does America see the children who arrive at its border? According to a new poll from the Public Religion Research Institute , the answer is \"sympathetically.\" The survey found that 69 percent of respondents thought these kids \"should be treated as refugees and should be allowed to stay in the U.S. if authorities determine it is not safe for them to return to their home country,\" and roughly the same percentage said the government should provide them with shelter and support. Only 27 percent said they \"should be treated as illegal immigrants and should be deported back to their home countries.\"\n\nIn the last fiscal year, 38,045 unaccompanied children from El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Mexico arrived at the U.S. border, according to Customs and Border Protection . Between July 1, 2013 and May 31, 2014, 46,188 children have arrived. The Obama administration has called this an \"urgent humanitarian situation\" and has called on federal agencies to provide housing and support. It's also considering granting refugee status to thousands of young Hondurans .\n\nUnlike immigrants, who are generally motivated by opportunities to work, study, or be with family, refugees are pushed to leave. But there often isn't a clear dividing line between \"forced\" and \"voluntary\" migration; people's motives are often mixed. To complicate things further, people fleeing violence or war don't automatically qualify as refugees under U.S. and international law. Many of the people leaving Central America for the U.S. face violence, war, and crime\u2014but not necessarily direct, particularized threats.\n\n\"Bombs fall or women are raped not because of who they are, but rather where they happen to be,\" Martin said. Just because 69 percent of Americans view Central American children as \"refugees\" doesn't mean they fit the technical definition of the word.\n\nSo what does this poll actually say about the swell of migrants at the border? For one, it suggests there's political will to help people from other countries, at least in the public. \"People realize that these kids do need help\u2014these families need help,\" said Kate Jastram, the faculty director of UC Berkeley Law's Institute for Global Challenges and the Law. \"I think in the general connotation of the word is consistent with our history ... our values of wanting to assist, to help.\"\n\n\"Bombs fall or women are raped not because of who they are, but where they happen to be.\"\n\nBut among most political leaders, she said, \"there's been a real effort not to characterize these kids as refugees.\" U.S. and international law says that countries cannot return legal refugees to their country of origin; because of this, the use of the word \"refugee\" is highly charged. \"The fear in the U.S. amongst policy makers is that if you encourage anyone at all, it will be more of a pull factor,\" she said. (One notable exception is Martin O'Malley, Maryland's governor and a 2016 presidential Democratic hopeful.)\n\nIn the poll, politics, not faith, seems to make the biggest difference in people's opinions. White evangelical Protestants, the most Republican major American religious group, were the least likely to agree that the government should offer services and support to unaccompanied minors while their cases are being reviewed\u2014only 56 percent agreed.\n\nBut it's also true that for most people, the colloquial sense \"refugee\" carries a greater moral weight than \"immigrant.\" \"Particularly because refugee law grew out of the Second World War and what happened\u2014and didn't happen\u2014for people who were trying to flee for their lives, there is a tremendous moral connotation to the word 'refugee,'\" Jastram said.\n\nThe use of that word may help to put U.S. immigration into a more moral light., especially as religious leaders become more vocal in advocating for the Central American children who show up at the border. \"I think it is consistent with the teachings of many religious traditions to welcome the stranger or assist those in need of care,\" Jastram said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Nearly seven in 10 Americans see children crossing the border as \"refugees\" rather than \"illegal immigrants.\" What does that say about the moral\u2014and political\u2014obligation to help them?", "author": "Emma Green", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "Nearly seven in 10 Americans see children crossing the border as \"refugees\" rather than \"illegal immigrants.\" What does that say about the moral\u2014and political\u2014obligation to help them?", "title": "What Makes Someone a Refugee?", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2014/07/RTR3XXYW/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/07/what-makes-someone-a-refugee/375216/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd15f7\"", "article_summary": "\"Particularly because refugee law grew out of the Second World War and what happened\u2014and didn't happen\u2014for people who were trying to flee for their lives, there is a tremendous moral connotation to the word 'refugee,'\" Jastram said.\nWhat makes someone a \"refugee\" is actually a legal question that determines a country's obligations toward them.\nU.S. and international law says that countries cannot return legal refugees to their country of origin; because of this, the use of the word \"refugee\" is highly charged.\nBut it's also true that for most people, the colloquial sense \"refugee\" carries a greater moral weight than \"immigrant.\"\nTo complicate things further, people fleeing violence or war don't automatically qualify as refugees under U.S. and international law."}
