Only 11 co-ops currently remain.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nDebate has ensued since the second half of 2015 over the sustainability of the remaining co-ops, what has gone wrong for so many, what needs to be done to monitor those remaining, and how to recoup any federal funding from those that have failed.\n\nEvergreen says its positive financial trend follows that which began in late 2015 and it expects the trend to continue going forward. Its success is no surprise to Evergreen, which has been following a unique and previously laid out strategy toward profitability and reporting record revenue.\n\n\"For a company in only its third year of sales, and in a business as competitive and as difficult to break into as health insurance, this is a remarkable achievement,\" said Evergreen CEO Dr. Peter Beilenson in a prepared statement. \"I'm extremely proud of our entire team and very grateful to our members, healthcare providers and brokers.\"\n\nBeilenson has attributed three factors for their success: A diversified book of business, appropriately-priced individual plans, and a heavy focus on wellness and prevention.\n\nEvergreen highlights that its additional achievements for Q1 2016 include:\n\n40,000 enrollees;\n\nRisk-based capital more than three times the state's requirement;\n\nA surplus of $25.3 million;\n\nPremium revenue of $40.9 million; and\n\nNet income of $547,000.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to get to 53,000 or so by the end of this year,\" Beilenson told Healthcare Dive earlier this year.\n\nRecommended Reading\n\nPR Newswire: Evergreen Health Announces Profitable First Quarter\n\nHealthcare Dive: As other co-ops fail, one shares its success story\n\nHealthcare Dive: The profitable Maryland ACA co-op lays out 3 strategies for profitability in 2016", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Heather Caspi", "twitter": {"domain": "Healthcare Dive", "site": "@healthcaredive", "card": "summary"}, "featured": "False", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/user_media/cache/df/bd/dfbd457874efd1164ffb4782287a8728.jpg", "sailthru.tags": "healthcare,type-newspost,healthcare-payer", "news_keywords": "Payer", "category": "News Post", "title": "Maryland co-op triumphant in profitable first quarter", "pub_date": "apr 28, 2016", "section": "news", "sailthru.date": "2016-04-28T13:58:46", "content_boost": 4, "touched": "True", "article_date_original": "Thursday, April 28, 2016, 01:58 PM", "medium": "news", "description": "Healthcare", "sailthru.expire_date": "2026-04-16T13:58:46", "teaser": "<p>Evergreen has long been a bright spot among the troubled&nbsp;ACA health cooperatives.</p>", "sponsored": "False", "date": "2016-04-28", "sailthru.description": "Evergreen has long been a bright spot among the troubled\u00a0ACA health cooperatives.", "viewport": "width=986", "og": {"site_name": "Healthcare Dive", "description": "Evergreen has long been a bright spot among the troubled\u00a0ACA health cooperatives.", "title": "Maryland co-op triumphant in profitable first quarter", "url": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/news/maryland-co-op-triumphant-in-profitable-first-quarter/418210/", "image": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/user_media/diveimage/champagne.jpg", "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "aN-77CvDv8Rt4OQnHMaUSm6V87TF8ri5GDUv93p7pHk", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/user_media/cache/42/b1/42b1ad73cdf26f52f147bd86fb6fa6ae.jpg"}, "article_summary": "Recommended ReadingPR Newswire: Evergreen Health Announces Profitable First QuarterHealthcare Dive: As other co-ops fail, one shares its success storyHealthcare Dive: The profitable Maryland ACA co-op lays out 3 strategies for profitability in 2016\nThe co-op's success is significant considering the difficulties experienced by the majority of the 23 cooperatives originally created.\nDive Brief:Maryland's Evergreen Health, one of the health insurance co-ops created under the Affordable Care Act, announced this week that it was profitable for three consecutive months from January through March.\nThe stretch marks Evergreen's first-ever profitable quarter in the young company's history.\nEvergreen says its positive financial trend follows that which began in late 2015 and it expects the trend to continue going forward."}
