The house voted yesterday to protect the "if you like it you can keep it" part of Obamacare.

Today Markwayne Mullin told KRMG news it wasn't the best alternative but it's important to bring relief to the American people.

"We have two choices.

We can try improving it the best we can or we can let the American people suffer.

Now, it doesn't make the bill good but we're trying to take something that's bad and not make it hurt as bad."



Even though 38 democrats voted for the bill one dem called the bill another G-O-P political stunt.



"He's one of those guys that he's going to follow the President.

If the President says 'jump off a cliff' he's going to go, too.

Because it's a wreck and they know it.

It's a train wreck; they know it.

It's a mess; they know it.

How could he possibly sit there and say it's just a stunt?"

Four Republicans including Jim Bridenstein voted against the bill.
