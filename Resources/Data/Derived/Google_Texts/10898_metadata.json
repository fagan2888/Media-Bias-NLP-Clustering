She was completing her late father\u2019s dream that all 10 of his children earn a bachelor\u2019s degree \u2014 19 years after her first start at JSU failed to take hold.\n\nWatching her make that milestone were her mom and nine siblings, relatives and her own four children \u2014 a crowd between 20 and 30 strong. \u201cWe did all the hollering on the floor,\u201d Angela\u2019s mother Rosie Courtney Moore was tickled to tell.\n\n\u201cThat was his grand dream, that all 10 of his children have a college education,\u201d Rosie said. The Rev. Quincy Charles Moore Jr. had been an educator, coach and mentor for more than 30 decades before retiring from Jackson Public Schools. He died eight years ago.\n\nHe\u2019d instilled in all his kids the importance of education. \u201cWhen we graduated high school, it was just the thing to do,\u201d Angela said. \u201cWe received a boombox, a trunk and a refrigerator. So you knew that you were going somewhere. You were going to college.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019d sat through numerous graduations; some sisters and brothers have doctor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees. She knew that one day she\u2019d sit, and walk, through her own. At times, that dorm-sized refrigerator was passed along to the current student in need.\n\nAngela graduated from Richland High School in 1995. Siblings\u2019 alma maters include JSU, but also Mississippi College, University of Southern Mississippi and Auburn.\n\nShe entered JSU as a freshman the same year her older brother, Quincy, was graduating; that fridge never had to leave campus. Angela entered her freshman year \u201cwith great hopes, aspirations and dreams,\u201d but realized some challenges once she got there. She lacked focus at the time. She completed that year but told her mom and dad she wasn\u2019t sure she wanted to go back.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a good reaction. ... They were not happy at all. At. All,\u201d Angela said, recalling her dad\u2019s quiet displeasure and the way both parents tried to talk her out of it. But she didn\u2019t know what direction to go in and feared some challenges ahead.\n\nHer mother Rosie said, even though money was tight, the family bonded together as with love and worked together as a unit to realize her husband\u2019s dream of all his children succeeding in life. \u201cHe knew education was the first step to help to get where you needed to be.\u201d\n\nWhen his daughter didn\u2019t continue her college studies, \u201cOh, he was so hurt.\u201d But he never gave up.\n\nIn the interim, Angela worked at the Mississippi State Hospital and as an EKG technician at Baptist Medical Center and Rankin Medical Center.\n\n\u201cI wanted more.\u201d After her father\u2019s death, they were going through his things. \u201cHe kept my 1995 admission to Jackson State University. And I have it,\u201d she said, her eyes shining. \u201cTo see the things that he wanted for me! I said, \u2018Lord, God, I can do this.\u2019 But I\u2019ve got to want it for myself.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like my life changed. They say dramatic things have to happen before you\u2019re able to commit. And I believe that.\u201d She got into church. \u201cWith a strong faith and deeper commitment, I was able to achieve that goal. And I am grateful for that.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just like the light bulb came on. ... I wanted to be better. I wanted to do it for myself. I wanted to do it for my kids, to be a role model for them,\u201d she said of her three daughters, ages 17, 16 and 14, and her son, 5.\n\n\u201cI thought about all the years he sacrificed for us, and it just meant more to me then.\u201d\n\nHer children were excited. \u201cThen I would tell them, now if I can make A\u2019s, B\u2019s, ... your mind is better than my mind. Get on the ball!\u201d\n\nHer daughters call her an inspiration. \u201cShe\u2019s persistent and never gave up,\u201d Deja Moore, 17, said. \u201cIf she can do it, we all can do it,\u201d Desarae Williams, 16, said. D\u2019shae Williams, 14, said, \u201cShe knew there were challenges but she gave God her best.\u201d\n\nAnd Quenton, Moore, 5, repeated the words he told his mom the night she graduated, \u201cI\u2019m proud of you.\u201d\n\nAngela praised JSU\u2019s College of Lifelong Learning for adult learners 25-plus, for flexibility that helped in her quest. \u201cI call it the one-stop shop, with affordable day care and weekend and evening classes.\u201d\n\nDay of graduation, Angela was so excited she woke up at 3 a.m. \u201cI was just full of emotion the whole week,\u201d crying one minute and running and jumping the next.\u201d She marveled at the way others walked with such grace and solemnity across the stage. She wanted to whoop, hop and jump. \u201cWhen they called my name, I was just so excited and happy,\u201d she said. \u201cI really wanted to roll!\u201d\n\nHer mother said she\u2019d been teary-eyed the whole week \u201cbecause it just brings back so many memories. I know he would be so proud to see his 10th child walk across that stage.\u201d It was doubly poignant for her. In her 40s, she\u2019d completed her own 20-year-old dream to go back to nursing school, with her family\u2019s full support.\n\nAngela\u2019s studies focused on education. She\u2019s been working as a teacher\u2019s assistant in the exceptional education class at Whitten Middle School. She plans to taking her test to get certified in special education and wants to get a master\u2019s degree in counseling.\n\nWhere her education\u2019s concerned, \u201cI tell them, \u2018To be continued ...\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: http://on.thec-l.com/1AW4SXo", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Angela Moore returned to college after a 19-year gap.", "og": {"site_name": "The Clarion Ledger", "description": "Angela Moore returned to college after a 19-year gap.", "title": "JSU grad fulfills late dad\u2019s dream: 10 kids with degrees", "url": "http://www.clarionledger.com/story/news/2014/12/21/jsu-grad-fulfills-late-dads-dream-kids-degrees/20747843/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/clarionledger.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Angela Moore returned to college after a 19-year gap.", "creator": "@clarionledger", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b060368d1c6587fbcde0a917652710bb90784354/c=0-400-1600-2000&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/JacksonMS/2014/12/21/B9315572074Z.1_20141221233622_000_GBQ9F8K84.1-0.jpg", "title": "JSU grad fulfills late dad\u2019s dream: 10 kids with degrees", "site": "@clarionledger", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=815835309", "fb": {"app_id": 127619637301465}, "article": {"author": "Sherry Lucas Writer"}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "article_summary": "Buy Photo Angela Moore, front, poses with family members, seated, Kevin Moore, mother Rosie Moore, standing, Jacqueline Jackson, Quincy Charles Moore III, Cassandra Moore and Candice Bold.\n\u201cThat was his grand dream, that all 10 of his children have a college education,\u201d Rosie said.\nThe JSU grad wanted to fulfill her late father\u2019s long-stated goal, but also to be a role model for her own children.\n\u201cWe did all the hollering on the floor,\u201d Angela\u2019s mother Rosie Courtney Moore was tickled to tell.\nShe was completing her late father\u2019s dream that all 10 of his children earn a bachelor\u2019s degree \u2014 19 years after her first start at JSU failed to take hold."}
