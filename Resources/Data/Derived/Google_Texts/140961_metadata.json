Generally, the courts and government will look to the following criteria, which are applicable in some way or another to most of the statutes discussed below , in determining whether a buyer that hires employees as part of an acquisition will have successor liability for pre-closing conduct of the seller:\n\nSubstantial continuity of the same business operations;\n\nUse of the same plant or facility;\n\nContinuity of the workforce;\n\nSimilarity of jobs and working conditions\n\nSimilarity of supervisory/managerial personnel;\n\nSimilarity in machinery, equipment and production methods;\n\nSimilarity of products or services; and\n\nAbility of the seller to provide relief.\n\n\u200bERISA Successor Liability Considerations\n\nThe Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) covers employee benefit plans such as pension benefit plans, health insurance, employee stock options, severance benefit plans and life insurance. The general test for determining whether a successor is responsible for the ERISA debts of the predecessor is whether:\n\nthe successor employer had prior notice of the claim against the predecessor; the predecessor was able, or was able prior to the purchase, to provide the relief requested; and there had been sufficient continuity in the business operations of the predecessor and successor\n\n\u200bSchilling v. Interim Healthcare of the Upper Ohio Valley, Inc., 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 45233 (S.D. Ohio June 9, 2008) (holding that the purchaser of the business assets of an employer was liable for the unpaid medical claims of the employees where the buyer knew the company had more than US$340,000 in unpaid medical claims, and knew that the company did not have the ability to pay those claims); Brend v. Sames Corp., 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12648 (N.D. Ill. 2002) (holding that under the doctrine of \u201csuccessor liability,\u201d a company purchasing the assets of a business could become responsible for \u201ctop hat\u201d plan liabilities of the selling company).\n\nThe two biggest issues for consideration in an asset purchase are single employer plans and multi-employer pension plans of the seller. As to single employer plans, an asset sale does not ordinarily involve the assumption of the seller\u2019s plan or liability for it. However, an asset buyer may assume liability simply by \u201cmaintaining\u201d the plan through contributions or by sponsoring it. If the seller does maintain such a plan, statements and actions to ensure that the buyer will not sponsor or contribute to any such plan are prudent, if not indemnification from the seller.\n\nWith respect to multi-employer pension plans, a buyer of assets wants to avoid any \u201cwithdrawal liability,\u201d which is imposed upon employers who cease to contribute to a Multi-Employer Plan. An asset sale will presumptively trigger a withdrawal if the seller is no longer a contributor to the Plan. Therefore, it is important at a minimum to confirm that the seller does not participate in any multi-employer plans, and if it does, to obtain appropriate assurances so that an unintended withdrawal does not occur so as to result in buyer liability.\n\nCOBRA Successor Liability Considerations\n\nThe Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA) requires employers to offer employees and covered dependents continued group health plan coverage at the employees\u2019 expense upon a qualifying event \u2013 including termination of employment. In an asset sale, COBRA is the issue an issue for the seller, who will need to ensure that terminated employees are provided COBRA notice and opportunity for continuing coverage.\n\nHowever, if the seller continues to sponsor a group health plan after the sale, the seller is reasonably assumed to have a continuing legal responsibility to continue COBRA coverage to former employees currently enrolled in COBRA, as well as employees who lose COBRA coverage for themselves and their dependents because they are not retained by the successor employer.\n\nFurther, the COBRA regulations contain a number of regulations explaining what happens to qualified beneficiaries in the event of an asset purchase transaction. Included in these regulations is an explanation of instances where the buyer is obligated to provide the continuation coverage under its own plan, even though it may not have ever employed the individual employees.\n\nOSHA Successor Liability\n\nThe Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) imposes general and specific health and safety requirements upon employers. OSHA can impose successor liability for pre-closing conduct when the buyer continues the business using the same premises, machinery, employees and supervisory personnel. See e.g., Dole v. H.M.S. Direct Mail Service, Inc., 752 F. Supp. 573 (W.D. N.Y. 1990), rev\u2019d in part on other grounds, 936 F.2d 108 (2nd Cir. 1991). Therefore, appropriate representations and warranties, and indemnification from the seller are prudent for the buyer. Further, a buyer must retain the seller\u2019s OSHA records for five years after the end of the year to which the records relate.\n\nIn very general terms, if the seller ceases to provide health coverage as a result of the transaction, and if the buyer continues the business operations associated with the assets purchased \u201cwithout interruption or substantial change,\u201d the buyer becomes a \u201csuccessor employer.\u201d If the buyer is a \u201csuccessor employer,\u201d a group health plan maintained by the buyer has the obligation to make COBRA coverage available to qualified beneficiaries with respect to that asset sale (which could include current and former employees of the seller currently on COBRA).\n\nWhile the COBRA regulations acknowledge that the determination of the obligation to provide COBRA coverage under asset purchase arrangements is based on \u201crelevant facts and circumstances,\u201d and thus clear cut guidelines do not exist, at minimum certain representations, allocations of responsibility and indemnification where possible, should be secured from the seller.\n\nSuccessor Liability Under Wage and Discrimination Statutes\n\nThe Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) governs the pay of minimum wage and overtime to employees. The FLSA applies to companies with one or more employees and mandates that employers pay non-exempt employees at least the federal minimum wage and overtime when the employee works over 40 hours in a working week. There are analogous state statutes. The penalties for non-compliance are possible double back wages up to three years for willful violations and attorneys\u2019 fees. Class actions naturally will increase the amount of potential liability. The successor rules apply to the FLSA in asset transactions; therefore, particularly in transactions involving many employees, the asset buyer should review payroll practices to determine wage and hour requirements and exceptions. Most successor liability under the FLSA will stem from (1) misclassification of employees as exempt, (2) allowing employees to work off the clock, (3) failure to calculate overtime correctly, or (4) misapplication of the exemption rules.\n\nSuccessor liability will generally not be imposed under other employment discrimination statutes (e.g. age, race, sex, etc.) following an asset sale when the seller is fully capable of providing relief or when the buyer did not have the opportunity to protect itself by an indemnification clause in the acquisition agreement or by a lower purchase price. When determining successor liability in the context of discrimination, (assuming the buyer meets the initial criteria of a successor employer \u2013 i.e., essentially, substantial continuity of the business operations), courts will also look to whether the buyer had notice of a charge or pending suit prior to acquiring the business or assets. Successorship principles may not apply, however, if the successor employer had no notice of a charge of discrimination.\n\nTransaction Implications Under Other Employment Statutes \u2013 WARN, FMLA and IRCA\n\nThe Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN) should be considered in larger transactions. WARN requires an employer (defined as 100 or more employees) to give 60 days detailed notice before closing a facility or a mass layoff at single site of employment. A \u201cmass layoff\u201d means a loss of 33% of the workforce equal to at least 50 employees or a loss of 500 or more employees. The seller has responsibility for providing notice of a plant closing or a layoff which takes place up to and including the closing date of the sale. Thereafter, notice is the buyer\u2019s obligation. The regulations also provide for notice from the buyer prior to the sale/merger if so contracted. Because of the large potential penalties involved (i.e., back wages and benefits for up to 60 days, attorneys fees and other penalties), companies should obtain specific advice when facing potential WARN issues in a transaction.\n\nThe Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) requires that employers with 50 or more employees within 75 miles provide to employees who have worked 12 months and 1,250 hours in the last year with 12 weeks of unpaid leave or equivalent intermittent leave for the birth, adoption or placement in foster care of a child, or the serious health condition of a family member or the employee.\n\nIf a new employer is deemed a successor in interest to an employee\u2019s previous employer, the new employer must grant FMLA leave to eligible employees who had provided appropriate notice to the selling employer. Further, the new employer must continue the leave begun by an employee while employed by the seller, including maintenance of group health benefits during the leave and job restoration at the conclusion of the leave. Finally, a successor in interest meeting FMLA coverage requirements must count periods of employment and hours worked for the seller for purposes of determining eligibility coverage. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7825.107; Cobb v. Contract Transp., Inc., 452 F.3d 543 (6th Cir., 2006) (broad successor obligations under FMLA); Wright v. Sandestin Invs., LLC, 914 F. Supp.2d 1273 (N.D. Fla., 2012). Therefore, a buyer after making its selection decisions should determine which employees (whether active or on leave) qualify for or are currently taking FMLA leave.\n\nThe Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA) prohibits an employer from hiring, recruiting or referring for a fee an individual without properly verifying the individual\u2019s identity and authorization to work in the US. The Act also prohibits discrimination on the basis of citizenship. Proper identification involves completion of Form I-9. Therefore, if the buyer intends to maintain or hire part of the workforce, it should obtain all new Form I-9s to insure proper completion.\n\nThe buyer should also assess the number of foreign workers and each worker\u2019s immigration status. Acquisitions can impact visa status, as H-1B and L visas are tied to specific employers and therefore an acquisition can have a critical impact on a foreign national\u2019s ability to work in the United States and affect the validity of the visa. The issue turns on whether the individual is working for a \u201cnew employer\u201d or under \u201cchanged circumstances\u201d such that a new application or new visa petition must be filed. Normally, a successor in interest will assume the rights, obligations and duties of the original petitioner/applicant, and the visas will remain intact. However, under certain circumstances (e.g., change in terms of employment) a new visa will have to be obtained.\n\nState Law Specific Successor Issues in Transactions\n\nAsset buyers must also be aware of successor-in-interest rules that apply under state workers\u2019 compensation and unemployment compensation statutes. The rules vary based on state and the nature of the transaction (e.g., substantially all v. partial asset purchase). Therefore, a buyer should obtain specific advice regarding the implications of the sellers\u2019 existing workers\u2019 compensation claims and rating experience on the buyer.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=5c6676c8-94c2-486f-b7c5-b13edbaef419", "image": "http://www.lexology.com/images/share/lexology-facebook.png", "description": "Retaining or hiring employees as part of a transaction, even in the context of an asset acquisition, presents a host of issues related to potential\u2026", "title": "Industrials insight - employer successor liability in US asset acquisitions | Lexology"}, "Description": "Retaining or hiring employees as part of a transaction, even in the context of an asset acquisition, presents a host of issues related to potential\u2026", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "However, an asset buyer may assume liability simply by \u201cmaintaining\u201d the plan through contributions or by sponsoring it.\nAs to single employer plans, an asset sale does not ordinarily involve the assumption of the seller\u2019s plan or liability for it.\nSuccessor liability will generally not be imposed under other employment discrimination statutes (e.g.\nSuccessorship principles may not apply, however, if the successor employer had no notice of a charge of discrimination.\nIf a new employer is deemed a successor in interest to an employee\u2019s previous employer, the new employer must grant FMLA leave to eligible employees who had provided appropriate notice to the selling employer."}
