In 2013, the average rate for ultrahigh therapy was $560 per day, contrasted by a rate of $445 for \u201cVery High\u201d therapy \u2014 500 to 719 minutes per week. The lowest category of therapy, 45 to 149 minutes per week, paid an average rate of $325 per day.\n\nThe report traces the increase in Ultra High therapy billing to payment rule changes adopted by Medicare in 1998, and implemented over the following years, culminating over the past several years. The WSJ report is seen by many as another damning brick against opportunistic providers, who, naturally, see it otherwise.\n\nThe new rules \u201cchanged the incentives, which changed the culture,\u201d said Vincent Mor, a Brown University health-services professor and chairman of the quality committee at HCR ManorCare Inc., to the Wall Street Journal. \u201cPlaying to the max has a long tradition in healthcare.\u201d\n\nThe report cites evidence that therapy can help improve residents' walking, talking and everyday tasks, but notes there's no research showing that more therapy leads to greater outcomes. More than two dozen former therapists, rehabilitation directors and other nursing home employees reported to the Wall Street Journal that they felt pressure from their managers to reach the 720-minute Ultra High therapy level.", "article_metadata": {"com.silverpop.brandeddomains": "www.pages05.net,forms.mcknights.com,mcknights.com,media.mcknights.com", "description": "Fifty-four percent of the therapy nursing that homes billed to Medicare in 2013 was at the \"Ultra High\" level, up from just 7% in 2002, a prominent story in the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday.", "content-language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "McKnight's", "description": "Fifty-four percent of the therapy nursing that homes billed to Medicare in 2013 was at the", "title": "WSJ digs into Ultra High therapy billing", "url": "http://www.mcknights.com/news/wsj-digs-into-ultra-high-therapy-billing/article/433164/", "image": "http://media.mcknights.com/images/2008/05/02/therapy_16773_16774.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Fifty-four percent of the therapy nursing that homes billed to Medicare in 2013 was at the", "creator": "@Emmongan", "image": {"src": "http://media.mcknights.com/images/2008/05/02/therapy_16773_16774.jpg"}, "title": "WSJ digs into Ultra High therapy billing", "site": "@mcknightsltcn", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 183363395035820}, "google-site-verification": "mx4rGVRiNxzj0lwxNljynJz1gArTEK6bZ0rK6AzvXic", "article": {"section": "News", "published_time": "2015-08-17T23:00:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-20T16:58:18"}, "Content-Type": "text/html", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf8c2\"", "article_summary": "WSJ digs into Ultra High therapy billingShare this content:linkedingoogleEmailPrintFifty-four percent of the therapy nursing that homes billed to Medicare in 2013 was at the \u201cUltra High\u201d level, up from just 7% in 2002, a prominent story in the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday.\nNursing home patients who receive Ultra High therapy \u2014 at least 720 minutes per week \u2014 generate some of the highest payments from Medicare, notes the WSJ analysis of billing records.\nThe report traces the increase in Ultra High therapy billing to payment rule changes adopted by Medicare in 1998, and implemented over the following years, culminating over the past several years.\nThe WSJ report is seen by many as another damning brick against opportunistic providers, who, naturally, see it otherwise.\nMore than two dozen former therapists, rehabilitation directors and other nursing home employees reported to the Wall Street Journal that they felt pressure from their managers to reach the 720-minute Ultra High therapy level."}
