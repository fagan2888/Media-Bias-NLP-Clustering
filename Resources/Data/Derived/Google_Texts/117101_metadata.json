He is a very kind, unselfish and caring physician. He will surely be missed by his patients and friends in Schuylkill County.\n\nShenandoah\n\n\u2022\n\nMy hat\u2019s off to Pine Grove Area School District for getting rid of that superintendent they had. In my opinion, it was $115,000 that would be better served flushed down the toilet. She destroyed Saint Clair Area School District inside and out and was very inflexible and hard to deal with. I congratulate Pine Grove for having enough sense to send her on her way, wherever that is.\n\nSaint Clair\n\n\u2022\n\nTo the caller from Ringtown who does not understand why most women will not vote for Hillary: Most women have self-respect and Christian values and will not vote for someone lacking these attributes. I would be ashamed to have Hillary represent America.\n\nTower City\n\n\u2022\n\nInstead of most people who go to work, come home and listen to snippets on the news, I read the newspaper and gather news. I read in your newspaper in black and white that Sen. Casey and Sen. Toomey, who never agreed to vote \u201cyes\u201d on anything together, conveniently voted for $700M in planes to go to Pakistan. That\u2019s what people don\u2019t understand, Democrat or Republican, it doesn\u2019t matter. Such a debt problem but we can send that money to Pakistan. What a joke. Our country is crying about debt but we have $700M worth of planes that we can ship to Pakistan and both our Pennsylvania representatives voted \u201cyes\u201d on it. Give me a break.\n\nPottsville\n\nAre you sure Pakistan wasn\u2019t buying those planes? That sounds like a more likely scenario to me.\n\n\u2022\n\nShenandoah borough is missing a lot of income they could have. There are coal trucks going through town without tarps on them. There are illegally parked cars, especially at fire hydrants; and when the churches are in, there are cars parked without registration and inspection. A lot of income they could have.\n\nShenandoah\n\n\u2022\n\nAccording to reporters, the people disrupting Trump campaign events are Bernie Sanders\u2019 supporters, communists and anarchists. They are not peaceful protesters. They are violent terrorists who should be arrested and prosecuted. They are trying to shut down the campaign event and prevent Trump from exercising his constitutional right of freedom of speech. Lock these terrorists up and throw away the key.\n\nPort Carbon\n\n\u2022\n\nTo all the callers complaining about the drug dealings and drug using and the cops not doing anything: I was one of the accusers until I became involved. Another set of eyes always helps. I started taking dates, times, descriptions of people, cars, even pictures. I\u2019d like to think I helped clean up the druggie problem from a few months ago in my town.\n\nTower City\n\nGood for you!!", "article_metadata": {"description": "Commentary, Pottsville editorials, Schuylkill, Editorials, editors column, op-ed, opinion, Republican Herald editorials", "author": "From Callers", "title": "Thunder/Enlightning, April 16, 2016", "robots": "ACAP allow-index", "DC.creator": "From Callers", "tout": {"article": {"id": "1.2031053"}}, "keywords": "Opinion", "DC.subject": "Opinion", "DC.title": "Thunder/Enlightning, April 16, 2016"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd348b\"", "article_summary": "She destroyed Saint Clair Area School District inside and out and was very inflexible and hard to deal with.\nOur country is crying about debt but we have $700M worth of planes that we can ship to Pakistan and both our Pennsylvania representatives voted \u201cyes\u201d on it.\nI\u2019d like to think I helped clean up the druggie problem from a few months ago in my town.\nShenandoah\u2022My hat\u2019s off to Pine Grove Area School District for getting rid of that superintendent they had.\nThey are trying to shut down the campaign event and prevent Trump from exercising his constitutional right of freedom of speech."}
