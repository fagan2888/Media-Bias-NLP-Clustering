It feels like just yesterday the fresh-faced stand-up comedian from New Jersey — then described as “sharp” by The New York Times and “overeager” by The Chicago Tribune — was sitting down for his first-ever “Daily Show” interview. He fidgeted with the buttons on his oversized suit like a nervous bar mitzvah boy and, in refreshing contrast to comedy frat-boy predecessor Craig Kilborn, charmed viewers with a particular Woody Allen-ish brand of self-deprecating humor.

Now, after nearly two decades on the satirical-news program, Jon Stewart prepares to sign off one last time.

For the next three weeks, leading up to “The Daily Show” host’s August 6 departure, Salon will be taking a look back at some of Stewart’s most memorable moments spanning his 16 years and five months.

It’s a wonder that Stewart had a writing staff back in 2005; with George W. Bush at the helm of the country, all the “Daily Show” host had to do was roll a clip of any of the Gaffe King’s public appearances and let the jokes write themselves. In the segment “Look Who’s Talking,” Stewart examined the president’s profoundly uncomfortable prime-time press conference, the fourth he’d done since the start the of his term as president. In it, Bush chose to address two major topics: energy and social security. He closed out the speech with history’s most morbid mic drop.
