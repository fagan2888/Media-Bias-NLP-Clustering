And while there may be such people, Brendan Mahoney doesn\u2019t seem to be one of them.\n\nWho is Brendan Mahoney? He\u2019s a 30-year-old law student from Connecticut. He already has health insurance through his school that he pays about $39-per-month for. Still, as the Wall Street Journal\u2019s James Taranto points out via the Hartford Courant, he decided on Wednesday to see what Obamacare could offer.\n\nSo he went on to his state exchange to sign up. What did he find? Lo and behold, the Obamacare exchange site had some great news: he could now save that $39 every month starting next year and have taxpayers front the bill for his new Medicaid coverage.\n\nRush Limbaugh read the story on his show Thursday and seemed disgusted.\n\n\u201cHere we have a future lawyer\u2026and he\u2019s been converted into a welfare case. And that ladies and gentleman is the objective,\u201d Limbaugh said. \u201cWhen you strip it all away, this shows how all of this is really designed to work.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt 30 years of age, he discovered he was eligible for Medicaid,\u201d Limbaugh added. \u201cAnd it is a joke here that they\u2019re saying, \u2018Great news we got a 30-year-old guy who could sign up. \u2026 They\u2019ve turned him into a ward of the state.\u2019\u201d\n\nDaily Rushbo has Limbaugh\u2019s full reaction:", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "If you listen to the President's rhetoric when it comes to why America needed Obamacare, it's riddled with stories of people who can't get health insurance and are falling through the cracks.
