Construction plans are now sitting on a shelf. (Photo: Nick Oza/The Republic) Story Highlights The rapid growth of cancer-patient options have created a highly fractured cancer-treatment market\n\nMIHS\u2019s future is so uncertain that the $935 million bond issue passed by voters last November is basically assigned to a shelf\n\nBetween accreditation issues and financial woes, one of Arizona\u2019s most serious health-care challenges has been rendered even more critical: addressing the state\u2019s serious lack of well-trained doctors\n\nThe perils facing Arizona's health-care industry in the new, post-Obamacare era are equal-opportunity scary:\n\nHospitals that choose to merge into bigger, more dynamic health-care providers face the uncertainty of whether their massive financial investments will match market expectations.\n\nThe ambitious, new $100 million University of Arizona Cancer Center opened in partnership between U of A and Dignity Health. It anticipates treating 60,000 patients each year within a decade, twice the patient total of Scottsdale\u2019s Mayo Clinic.\n\nUnfortunately, there are plenty of cancer patients to go around. But the rapid growth of cancer-patient options, including community-based cancer centers, have created a highly fractured cancer-treatment market in Arizona, as medical writer Ken Alltucker recently reported in The Republic. With almost every major health-care player investing tens of millions of dollars in cancer treatment, the prospects for someone guessing wrong could be high.\n\nMeanwhile, standing pat isn\u2019t such a pleasant place to be, either.\n\nWith no big partnership opportunities on the horizon and an uncertain patient base, the Maricopa Integrated Health System \u2013 the county\u2019s safety-net hospital \u2013 is struggling with real mission uncertainty.\n\nThe system\u2019s historic core patient group, the county\u2019s poor and mostly uninsured residents, increasingly is gaining coverage through the state\u2019s expanded indigent health-care program, AHCCCS. Coverage has given those patients options. Many of them are exercising those options at other hospitals.\n\nMIHS lost $24.8 million in fiscal 2014, losses that the system\u2019s chief executive officer Stephen Purves attributed to the phasing out of the state's safety net care pool as part of Medicaid expansion. Critics have savaged the MIHS board for poor management, but it is hard to balance the books when $50 million evaporates.\n\nPurves and other hospital executives have increased efficiency to close the deficit, but they're looking to the Legislature for help.\n\nSince the 1990s, the federal government has sent Arizona and other states something called \"disproportionate share\" money earmarked to help hospitals that treat large numbers of the poor and uninsured. The state has always kept most of the money for itself, sending $4.2 million to MIHS.\n\nIt has become a disproportionate share. In fiscal 2015 and 2016, MIHS expects to certify $219 million in uncompensated costs; for which the feds will reimburse almost $151 million. Under the current formula, the Legislature would siphon off $142 million, leaving $8.4 million for the safety-net hospital.\n\nHospital executives make a good case for a better share, but the Legislature faces its own challenges. It's hard to give up money it has come to count on.\n\nThe moral of this hospital-industry lesson? For other hospital systems, market consolidation and creative partnerships appear to be the way forward. The new cancer centers are examples of the latter. The year\u2019s most dramatic example of the former was the University of Arizona Health Network\u2019s $1 billion merger in February with Banner Health.\n\nThat expands Banner's footprint and shores up what had become a creaky hospital-affiliated network in Tucson. But it also raised other concerns back in Phoenix.\n\nUA's College of Medicine-Phoenix hit a bump on its journey to full accreditation.\n\nThe Banner Health merger left insufficient decision-making power in the hands of the Phoenix med school\u2019s dean, and too much in Banner\u2019s board room, the accrediting agency warned UA President Ann Weaver Hart.\n\nUA-Phoenix Medical School Dean Stuart Flynn expresses confidence that they will get the line-of-authority bugs worked out. But between the UA\u2019s accreditation issues and MIHS\u2019s financial woes, one of Arizona\u2019s most serious health-care challenges has been rendered even more critical: addressing the state\u2019s serious lack of well-trained doctors. The hospital systems are two of the state\u2019s most important training grounds for new doctors.\n\nMIHS\u2019s future is so uncertain that the $935 million bond issue passed by voters last November is basically assigned to a shelf. It's covering past purchases of phone and tech equipment, but no new construction is on the drawing board.\n\nWhat, exactly, can the hospital spend all that money on if it doesn\u2019t know what it needs to be? When a public institution cannot spend voter-approved bond money as intended, that spells serious uncertainty.\n\nBut that is the nature of the health-care industry today. It is mostly true everywhere. But the future is undeniably murky here.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://azc.cc/1EImwEY", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Our View: Whether entering into mergers, opening new cutting-edge cancer centers, nothing is certain for Arizona's health-care industry.", "og": {"site_name": "azcentral", "description": "Our View: Whether entering into mergers, opening new cutting-edge cancer centers, nothing is certain for Arizona's health-care industry.", "title": "Our View: Arizona hospitals are in a wild state of flux", "url": "http://www.azcentral.com/story/opinion/editorial/2015/09/05/arizona-hospital-cancer-mihs/71620796/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/azcentral.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Our View: Whether entering into mergers, opening new cutting-edge cancer centers, nothing is certain for Arizona's health-care industry.", "title": "Our View: Arizona hospitals are in a wild state of flux", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/5226fba5d84089428a94b79607b2dfeaeae11693/c=67-0-334-267&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/09/02/Phoenix/Phoenix/635768261776884933-Maricopa-Medical-Center-in-2014.jpg", "creator": "@azcentral", "site": "@azcentral", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600023563", "fb": {"app_id": 115142145268769}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Places/University of Arizona", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Places/University of Arizona", "title": "Our View: Arizona hospitals are in a wild state of flux", "author": "Editorial board", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "opinion/editorial", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/04a2b1a7b08317845c291b56bb35cf287e5cf1c5/c=100-0-300-267/local/-/media/2015/09/02/Phoenix/Phoenix/635768261776884933-Maricopa-Medical-Center-in-2014.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/180fa20150d4e23a19ed22a3b2006986af5a688d/c=67-0-334-267/local/-/media/2015/09/02/Phoenix/Phoenix/635768261776884933-Maricopa-Medical-Center-in-2014.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/38ceb94cd6dded3c85b842d82679b1c561857030/c=22-0-377-267/local/-/media/2015/09/02/Phoenix/Phoenix/635768261776884933-Maricopa-Medical-Center-in-2014.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/db1bc7ebe5a28a56be455efb5905f8d42ba4ef2f/c=0-21-400-247&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2015/09/02/Phoenix/Phoenix/635768261776884933-Maricopa-Medical-Center-in-2014.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-09-05T15:39:07.530000-07:00", "shorthed": "Our View: Arizona hospitals in state of flux", "articleid": 71620796, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/bfed09a733bce9a6dbb49982e953ce663b5956f3/c=0-21-400-247/local/-/media/2015/09/02/Phoenix/Phoenix/635768261776884933-Maricopa-Medical-Center-in-2014.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/02ae144f701289c3c48441605bf816267c6a1fcd/c=125-0-275-267/local/-/media/2015/09/02/Phoenix/Phoenix/635768261776884933-Maricopa-Medical-Center-in-2014.jpg"}}, "news_keywords": "Maricopa Integrated Health System, Banner Health, Dignity Health, Obamacare, University of Arizona, College of Medicine-Phoenix"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd24f1\"", "article_summary": "For other hospital systems, market consolidation and creative partnerships appear to be the way forward.\nSince the 1990s, the federal government has sent Arizona and other states something called \"disproportionate share\" money earmarked to help hospitals that treat large numbers of the poor and uninsured.\nThe ambitious, new $100 million University of Arizona Cancer Center opened in partnership between U of A and Dignity Health.\nBut between the UA\u2019s accreditation issues and MIHS\u2019s financial woes, one of Arizona\u2019s most serious health-care challenges has been rendered even more critical: addressing the state\u2019s serious lack of well-trained doctors.\nThe hospital systems are two of the state\u2019s most important training grounds for new doctors."}
