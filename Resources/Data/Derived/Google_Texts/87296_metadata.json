While some financial experts advise workers to have $1 million in retirement savings socked away, Americans on average have managed to save only $58,000 each.\n\nLeaving the workforce early can have a real impact on your retirement income, especially since claiming Social Security before full retirement age results in lower payments.\n\nRelated: The 10 Best States for Retirement in 2015\n\nDespite the desire \u2013 and the need -- to work as long as they can, many Americans end up taking retirement far earlier than they had hoped, and there are several factors that increase the chances of that, according to a new study from Boston College\u2019s Center for Retirement Research.\n\nHere are three of the top reasons Americans take unplanned early retirements.\n\nHealth issues. Workers suffering from poor health and those whose health has declined before their planned retirement are \u201csignificantly more likely to retire early than others,\u201d the researchers found. That jibes with earlier research from the National Institute on Aging, which found that poor health is cited as a reason for retirement among one-third of people between ages 55 and 59.\n\nInvoluntary job loss. Prolonged periods of job losses can heighten the chance that older workers will take retirement before they had planned. Americans who lose their jobs through layoffs or business closings are about 28 percent more likely to retire early than other workers.\n\nRelated: Millions of Boomers Are Making This Big Retirement Mistake\n\nThe good news is that finding a new job can help reduce that risk. Yet the researchers noted that not all jobs are created equal: Switching to a job with more stress or that pays less actually makes workers more likely to retire early. \u201cThis result suggests not all mobility is a good thing \u2013 movement has to be to the kind of job that is conducive to an extended career,\u201d the researchers noted.\n\nFamily changes: Two family changes can make it more likely that workers will retire early: if their spouse has already retired, and if their parents move in with them, the researchers found. Couples often make a decision to retire at the same time, so the researchers note that the former finding isn\u2019t all that surprising. But the latter could have implications for today\u2019s Baby Boomers and Generation X, given that more of Americans are dealing with aging parents who need additional care.\n\nRegardless of the reason for an unexpected retirement, financial experts recommend Americans create a backup plan for how to cope with an unplanned early retirement, such as financial strategies for living on lower-than-expected income.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Your golden years are supposed to be a time when you kick back and enjoy a well-earned", "title": "Top 3 Reasons You May Have to Retire Before You\u2019re Ready", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/10/05/Top-3-Reasons-You-May-Have-Retire-You-re-Ready", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/slideshows/07192011_Retirement_401k_slideshow.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/10/05/Top-3-Reasons-You-May-Have-Retire-You-re-Ready", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/slideshows/07192011_Retirement_401k_slideshow.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Your golden years are supposed to be a time when you kick back and enjoy a well-earned", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Americans who lose their jobs through layoffs or business closings are about 28 percent more likely to retire early than other workers.\nWorkers suffering from poor health and those whose health has declined before their planned retirement are \u201csignificantly more likely to retire early than others,\u201d the researchers found.\nYet the researchers noted that not all jobs are created equal: Switching to a job with more stress or that pays less actually makes workers more likely to retire early.\nCouples often make a decision to retire at the same time, so the researchers note that the former finding isn\u2019t all that surprising.\nFamily changes: Two family changes can make it more likely that workers will retire early: if their spouse has already retired, and if their parents move in with them, the researchers found."}
