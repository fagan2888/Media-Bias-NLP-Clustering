Kane, said that the overdose deaths were most likely caused by a mix of heroin and fentanyl, a strong pain medicine.\n\n\u201cTogether, these drugs are creating an extremely dangerous and potentially lethal combination for users,\u201d Ms. Kane said in a statement.\n\nThe deaths occurred in Pittsburgh and several surrounding counties, officials said. The heroin was placed in small bags stamped with the words Theraflu, Bud Ice and Income Tax.\n\nThe Allegheny County medical examiner\u2019s office in Pittsburgh reported on Friday that three people had died from overdoses of a strong form of heroin in 48 hours. The number of deaths continued to rise over the weekend.\n\nPhoto\n\nMayor William Peduto of Pittsburgh warned residents about the deadly heroin on Saturday after four more overdoses and another fatality in the city.\n\n\u201cThose who are in possession of this potent formula are in danger of losing their lives,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will kill you. The danger cannot be overstated.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Peduto told a local television station that the outbreak was not just an urban problem.\n\n\u201cHeroin doesn\u2019t pick and choose by class or by race,\u201d he said. \u201cIf somebody has an addictive personality and they get into heroin, then they\u2019re stuck.\u201d\n\nThe attorney general\u2019s office said the police were working to remove the deadly heroin from the streets and to arrest anyone caught selling or producing the drug. The stamped bags were found in Allegheny, Armstrong, Beaver, Butler, Lawrence and Westmoreland Counties in the western part of the state, and Ms. Kane said the drugs could be moving across the rest of Pennsylvania.\n\nThe medical examiner\u2019s office released photos of the heroin bags, marked \u201cTheraflu\u201d in red to show residents what to look out for. The office said the people who had died from overdoses all had a history of drug abuse, according to The Associated Press.\n\nFentanyl is a powerful painkiller similar to morphine, but more potent, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse. When it is mixed with heroin or cocaine, it amplifies their strength and can cause respiratory problems, nausea and sedation.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140127225539, "twitter": {"description": "State officials warned users about the dangerous drug as the number of deaths mounted over the weekend.", "creator": "emmagf", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/28/us/pennsylvania-deaths-of-22-linked-to-batch-of-heroin.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002674615"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "title": "Pennsylvania Deaths of 22 Linked to Batch of Heroin", "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/01/28/us/HEROIN/HEROIN-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/28/us/pennsylvania-deaths-of-22-linked-to-batch-of-heroin.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002674615", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/28/us/pennsylvania-deaths-of-22-linked-to-batch-of-heroin.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "us", "hdl_p": "Pennsylvania Deaths of 22 Linked to Batch of Heroin", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/us/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Jan. 27, 2014", "edt": "NewYork", "keywords": "Pennsylvania,Heroin,Deaths (Fatalities),Kane  Kathleen G,Drug Abuse and Traffic", "description": "State officials warned users about the dangerous drug as the number of deaths mounted over the weekend.", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Emma G.
