Yet today I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of this earth. I have been in ballparks for 17 years and have never received anything but kindness and encouragement from you fans.\n\n\u201cLook at these grand men. Which of you wouldn\u2019t consider it the highlight of his career just to associate with them for even one day? Sure, I\u2019m lucky. Who wouldn\u2019t consider it an honor to have known Jacob Ruppert? Also, the builder of baseball\u2019s greatest empire, Ed Barrow? To have spent six years with that wonderful little fellow, Miller Huggins? Then to have spent the next nine years with that outstanding leader, that smart student of psychology, the best manager in baseball today, Joe McCarthy? Sure, I\u2019m lucky.\n\n\u201cWhen the New York Giants, a team you would give your right arm to beat, and vice versa, sends you a gift \u2014 that\u2019s something. When everybody down to the groundskeepers and those boys in white coats remember you with trophies \u2014 that\u2019s something. When you have a wonderful mother-in-law who takes sides with you in squabbles with her own daughter \u2014 that\u2019s something. When you have a father and a mother who work all their lives so you can have an education and build your body \u2014 it\u2019s a blessing. When you have a wife who has been a tower of strength and shown more courage than you dreamed existed \u2014 that\u2019s the finest I know.\n\n\u201cSo I close in saying that I may have had a tough break, but I have an awful lot to live for.\u201d\n\n(via LouGehrig.com)", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"Fans, for the past two weeks you have been reading about the bad break I got.
