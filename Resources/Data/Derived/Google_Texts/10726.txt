From Jon Ward and Andrew Romano writing at Yahoo! Politics:

On the afternoon of July 30, 2013, Marco Rubio walked onto the floor of the Senate to give another stem-winder — the latest in a season of feisty speeches.

“Is there an issue on which we are willing to do everything we can and lay it all on the line?” Rubio asked his fellow senators. “If it is not this one, which one is it?”

For months, the freshman from Florida had been one of the central figures in American politics. The previous November, Republican Mitt Romney had received only 27 percent of Latino support on his way to losing the election, and that same night the GOP pinned its hopes on Rubio, a 41-year-old Cuban-American who had served in Washington for less than two years.
