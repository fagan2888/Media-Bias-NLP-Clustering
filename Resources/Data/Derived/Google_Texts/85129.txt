So-called health co-ops continue to have problems in ObamaCare, leading one analyst to suggest they were a mistake to create.

As explained by Healthcare.gov, a health co-op is "a non-profit organization in which the same people who own the company are insured by the company."

The co-ops, after they're formed, offer insurance through the "Marketplace" created by ObamaCare.

On October 16, Colorado's co-op and one in Oregon announced they were folding, joining six others that have either collapsed or plan to wind down operations.

Yevgeniy Feyman of the Manhattan Institute says the co-ops were created after plans for the so-called public-option was tossed out. The idea was that non-profits would have lower costs and be able to charge lower premiums.

"So they gave them a bunch of money in federal loans," Feyman recalls.

In fact, those eight, now-failed co-ops alone have received $900 million in federal tax dollars.

The Daily Signal reports that 22 of 23 co-ops lost money in 2014 â€“ when their non-profit existence was meant to help them survive.

The Wall Street Journal reports that health cooperatives are collapsing at such a rapid pace that co-ops and small insurers are forming a coalition to consider legal action to change health-law provisions they blame for their financial distress.

Feyman says there are non-profit insurers around the country that already exist and some of them do better than others.

"Others do worse. It varies," says Feyman. "But just being a non-profit doesn't mean you're going to do any better job than a for-profit insurer."

He adds that the idea of giving the taxpayer's money to make them work better is "pretty much baseless."
