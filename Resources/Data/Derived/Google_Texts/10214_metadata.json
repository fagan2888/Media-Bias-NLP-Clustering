Jaime Herrera Beutler because he\u2019s disappointed by his fellow Republican\u2019s voting record.\n\nHe ticked off a few examples and then said, \u201cSometimes it\u2019s difficult to know why she votes\u201d the way she does.\n\n\u201cIn 2008, I ran against Brian Baird,\u201d Delavar told a crowd of about 30 people last week at a debate hosted by the Klickitat Democrats and Republicans in Goldendale. \u201cAnd he had the distinction, I believe, of having over 500 town halls. Even though I disagree with his votes, he set a great example of coming before the people, hearing from them directly.\u201d\n\nSuddenly, his Democratic opponent, Bob Dingethal, also vying for the 3rd Congressional District seat, who was waiting to give his opening remarks, started nodding his head in agreement.\n\nThe odds are against both Dingethal and Delavar: it\u2019s very difficult to unseat an incumbent. But as the two campaign to distinguish themselves from the two-term congresswoman and each other, there is one point that continually resurfaces.\n\nHerrera Beutler\u2019s \u201caloofness and unwillingness to engage are her biggest weakness,\u201d Dingethal said.\n\n\u201cIt shows a lack of courage and conviction. \u2026 If she\u2019s so confident her policies are the right ones, she should be confident to stand up in front of people and discuss them in detail,\u201d he said.\n\nIt\u2019s a criticism Herrera Beutler seems accustomed to hearing, saying she\u2019s taken a \u201cvigorous approach\u201d to town halls throughout the district. The congresswoman hosts \u201ccommunity coffees\u201d; people who live nearby are called and invited to participate.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve hosted a tremendous amount of meetings in the district, and I\u2019m not going to let up on that and I\u2019m going to do it in a way that I think best allows people to share honestly and openly and frankly what their thoughts and needs are,\u201d she has told The Columbian.\n\nIf elected, both Delavar and Dingethal said they would host traditional town hall meetings.\n\nSo far, Delavar and Dingethal have debated each other three times. They have a fourth scheduled next week. Last week, the two faced off in Bucoda and spoke to a group of about 10. Herrera Beutler wasn\u2019t there \u2014 Congress is in session \u2014 but someone from her campaign was sent to videotape the event. Her campaign said she wasn\u2019t offered the opportunity to send someone to speak on her behalf.\n\n\u201cShe plays the political game pretty effectively by not making definitive statements about things,\u201d Dingethal said.\n\nBut sometimes, \u201cright or wrong,\u201d he charged, \u201cyou have to tell people what you believe.\u201d\n\nVersus the incumbent: Bob Dingethal\n\nDingethal knows he\u2019s the underdog.\n\nHe knows Herrera Beutler will likely outspend him several times over.\n\nBut it\u2019s not stopping him.\n\n\u201cIf I can reach enough people and there is enough dissatisfaction there \u2026\u201d Dingethal said.\n\nThe 58-year-old candidate is originally from Cleveland, Ohio. He was one of seven children and struggled as a young adult when both his parents died, his mom when he was 18 and his father when he was 20. He ended up going on a cross-country road trip, landing at college in San Jose, Calif. A mid-life re-evaluation after a career in telecommunications sent him back to school; he earned his master\u2019s in public affairs and went to work for U.S. Sen. Maria Cantwell as her outreach director.\n\nDingethal\u2019s unapologetic for what he called a \u201cdivisive\u201d support of public unions, noting they are key to bolstering the middle class by ensuring fair wages through collective bargaining.\n\nThere are the wedge issues that separate him and his opponents \u2014 he supports stricter gun laws, he has a different take on immigration reform, he was in favor of the Columbia River Crossing project as proposed.\n\n\u201cWe should be under construction right now,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cShe could have taken a leadership role in that and help facilitate the CRC. She did not,\u201d he said of Herrera Beutler, R-Camas.\n\nAnd of course there is the Affordable Care Act, which Herrera Beutler would like to see repealed.\n\n\u201cYet she\u2019s been the beneficiary of tax dollars for her family health needs,\u201d Dingethal said, noting that Herrera Beutler\u2019s young daughter was born without kidneys and was in the hospital for an extended period.\n\nBut there\u2019s also a style difference, Dingethal maintains.\n\nDingethal blasts Herrera Beutler for making some choices solely to benefit her long-term career.\n\n\u201cHaving a young Latino female is a great thing and we need to promote more, but I don\u2019t think she\u2019s representative of that community,\u201d he said.\n\nIf elected, he said, he\u2019s willing to take risks. He would work to lower student debt, decrease class sizes and make education a priority. He aligns closely with many of the Democratic Party\u2019s core values on the environment and women\u2019s right to choose, and is in favor of the move to decriminalize marijuana.\n\nBut he believes there is a lot he can do that isn\u2019t legislative.\n\n\u201cFor a U.S. Representative, there is a lot you can do, but it takes showing up,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not all about passing legislation or voting with your party line. It\u2019s about connecting people with the right agency. I think you saw that with Brian Baird, and that\u2019s what I would like to bring back,\u201d Dingethal said.\n\nVersus the incumbent: Michael Delavar\n\nCongress, Delavar said, is trying to \u201crun our lives.\u201d\n\nAnd he thinks it is doing a lousy job.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m tired of our rights\u2019 being trampled \u2014 when you hear about the NSA (National Security Agency) storing our emails, storing our phone calls and every time you turn around our government is getting larger and more obtrusive in our lives,\u201d he said.\n\nDelavar, a Washougal airline pilot, is an evangelical Christian who believes the Bible should be interpreted literally; he\u2019s running on the belief that the Constitution should be handled the same. Congress has overreached on too many occasions, he said, and is not following the founding fathers\u2019 wisdom.\n\nIf he is elected, there might be legislation he believes is a good idea.\n\nBut \u201cmy bellwether is the Constitution,\u201d he said. If he doesn\u2019t believe the government has authority, no matter the need, he would not be in favor.\n\nWhich is why he believes convicted felons, after serving time, should not have their \u201cright to bear arms\u201d revoked.\n\nHe said his position includes people convicted of all crimes, including domestic abuse.\n\n\u201cThe question I have to ask is, \u2018If part of the purpose to owning guns is to defend yourself in the worst-case scenario against your own government, and you have to ask your government for permission to have a gun \u2014 isn\u2019t there something wrong with that picture?\u2019 \u201d he said.\n\nDelavar grew up in Colorado Springs, Colo., where his father worked for the Department of Defense. He was home-schooled and he now home-schools his two sons. He grew up reading the Federalist Papers and says he believes wholeheartedly in government \u201cas the founding fathers understand them and the wisdom of limiting the federal government.\u201d\n\nDelavar, who voted for Herrera Beutler in 2010, takes issue with her vote to end the government shutdown. And he said she voted in favor of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012, which had a controversial component giving the government the ability to indefinitely detain a suspected terrorist.\n\nHe believes the children who are crossing into the U.S. need to be immediately shipped back across the border and that the president needs to \u201cfaithfully execute the laws.\u201d\n\nIf elected, he would sign on to legislation to audit the Federal Reserve and push for the U.S. to get out of the United Nations.\n\nAnd like Dingethal, he said, he would host numerous town halls and \u201clisten to people even if they don\u2019t support (my) position.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "Michael Delavar says he's running against U.S. Rep.
