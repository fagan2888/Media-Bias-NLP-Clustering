Conservatives, he said, \u201cneed to ensure that the safety net is well-designed and strong enough to provide a firm basis for those starting out on life\u2019s ladder.\u201d\n\n1 of 11 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 10 myths about Obama (that people actually believe) View Photos We\u2019ve all heard them: Misinformation about President Obama has a penchant for spreading like wildfire.

The Post\u2019s Swati Sharma attempts to set a few matters straight. We\u2019ve all heard them: Misinformation about President Obama has a penchant for spreading like wildfire. Dana Milbank offers a few answers for the reasons, as he characterizes it , that the Kenyan born Muslim raised in a madrassa president somehow attracts lies and rumors that are far from the truth. As for the rumors themselves, we have compiled a list that aren't the most outrageous but have a surprising base of believers.

But running a state has given him an elevated perspective.\n\n\u201cDebates that happen in Washington, D.C., pretty easily get far afield of the real-world impacts on real people,\u201d he told me in an interview Monday afternoon. \u201cIt will not be enough for new Republican majorities in the Congress and a Republican president to cut government spending,\u201d he added, calling instead for money to be sent to the states so they can \u201csolve the intractable problems.\u201d\n\nPence isn\u2019t about to admit it, but Obamacare does that.\n\nHe thinks he has a conservative alternative to the new law\u2019s expansion of Medicaid: He wants to broaden the \u201cHealthy Indiana\u201d plan started by his predecessor Mitch Daniels (R) by using financial incentives to get the working poor to contribute to their health coverage under a private alternative to Medicaid. The Obama administration appears likely to grant Indiana a waiver for the experiment \u2014 and if it works, other states will be free to follow the example.\n\nStarting in 2017, states will be able to experiment further, securing exemptions from problematic provisions of the law such as the individual mandate, the employer mandate and the health-care exchanges. If Republican governors don\u2019t like Obamacare\u2019s requirements, all they have to do is come up with an alternative that provides comparable care and coverage.\n\nPence declined to speculate about whether he might seek a waiver exempting Indiana from Obamacare overall. He continues to support the law\u2019s repeal, and he spent a good chunk of his AEI speech bemoaning its flaws.\n\nHe has to do that if he wants to compete in Republican presidential primaries. Although not usually mentioned in the top tier, Pence is well positioned at a time when the party\u2019s strongest candidates are governors. He has a better record than New Jersey\u2019s Chris Christie, is smarter than Texas\u2019s Rick Perry, is not as divisive as Wisconsin\u2019s Scott Walker and is more conservative than former Florida governor Jeb Bush. He speaks the language of Christian conservatives \u2014 twice in his AEI speech he wove in biblical passages from Luke without citation \u2014 and his Medicaid experiment should earn him some moral authority.\n\nWhile other GOP governors continue to refuse the Medicaid expansion money \u2014 a decision that inevitably means lost lives \u2014 Pence reminds them, and everyone, that \u201cwe\u2019re talking about real people, working people who deserve a better way.\u201d He made it his administration\u2019s job to help the \u201cproud Hoosiers\u201d \u2014 people \u201cwho find themselves essentially, for all intents and purposes, caught in that gap where their income simply doesn\u2019t give them the ability to purchase health insurance for themselves or for their families.\u201d\n\nThis, of course, is what Obamacare is all about. As more conservatives realize that the law they hate allows them to implement policies they like, they may have trouble recalling what all the fuss was about.\n\nTwitter: @Milbank\n\nRead more from Dana Milbank\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The conservative governor will use Medicaid expansion money to broaden coverage for working poor.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/danamilbank", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The conservative governor will use Medicaid expansion money to broaden coverage for working poor.", "title": "Dana Milbank: Indiana Gov.
