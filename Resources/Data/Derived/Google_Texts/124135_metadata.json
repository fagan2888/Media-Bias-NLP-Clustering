In a recent survey, one in five people with employer-based coverage said they would opt for fewer health benefits if they could get a bump in their wages. That\u2019s double the percentage who said they would make that choice in 2012.\n\n\u201cI do these surveys all the time, and it\u2019s rare where you see things change that quickly,\u201d said Paul Fronstin, director of the health research and education program at the Employee Benefit Research Institute, which conducted the survey of 1,500 workers with Greenwald & Associates.\n\nFronstin speculated that worker frustration with low wage growth may be driving the shift in attitudes.\n\nWage and salary increases have hovered around 2 to 3 percent in recent years, generally rising more slowly than cost increases of annual health care benefits.\n\nOverall, two-thirds of people with employer-sponsored coverage reported that they were satisfied with their health insurance benefits in 2015, the survey found, lower than the 74 percent satisfaction figure in 2012. Meanwhile, the percentage of people who would accept a smaller paycheck for better health insurance benefits was 14 percent last year, essentially unchanged from 15 percent three years earlier.\n\nThe growing willingness to trade health benefits for wages may be linked to some degree to the millennial generation\u2019s growing share of the workforce, Fronstin said, referring to people born between roughly 1980 and 2000.\n\n\u201cThe younger you are, the less important health insurance is to you,\u201d Fronstin said.\n\nAs baby boomers retire and younger workers move in behind them, it may affect the mix of benefits that employers offer. But as today\u2019s \u201cyoung invincibles\u201d age, chances are they\u2019ll see more value in their health insurance and the pendulum will swing back again, according to Fronstin.\n\nThis piece originally appeared in Kaiser Health News.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "More wages, less health insurance.", "title": "Here's What Employees Want Even More Than Health Insurance", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/04/06/Heres-What-Employees-Want-Even-More-Health-Insurance", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/05072010_workers_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/04/06/Heres-What-Employees-Want-Even-More-Health-Insurance", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/05072010_workers_article.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "More wages, less health insurance.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Meanwhile, the percentage of people who would accept a smaller paycheck for better health insurance benefits was 14 percent last year, essentially unchanged from 15 percent three years earlier.\nMore wages, less health insurance.\nBut as today\u2019s \u201cyoung invincibles\u201d age, chances are they\u2019ll see more value in their health insurance and the pendulum will swing back again, according to Fronstin.\n\u201cThe younger you are, the less important health insurance is to you,\u201d Fronstin said.\nOverall, two-thirds of people with employer-sponsored coverage reported that they were satisfied with their health insurance benefits in 2015, the survey found, lower than the 74 percent satisfaction figure in 2012."}
