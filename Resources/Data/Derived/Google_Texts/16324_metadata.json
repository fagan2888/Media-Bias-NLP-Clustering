More people than ever \u2014 some 53 million Americans and growing \u2014 work for themselves or piece together a variety of gigs. But laws haven\u2019t kept pace with the economy\u2019s rapid evolution, depriving many freelancers of the benefits and protections of full-time jobs.\n\nNow momentum is building for broad-based nationwide efforts to improve the lives of independent workers. Two initiatives unveiled this week \u2014 a call for portable benefits and a Good Work Code \u2014 seek to provide a social safety net and guarantees of stability alongside flexibility.\n\n\u201cThis is a moment when there\u2019s an opportunity to meaningfully move the conversation forward,\u201d said Greg Nelson, a former top Obama adviser leading a new coalition that backs portable benefits for contract workers. \u201cA number of factors are intersecting that impact workers and how people work.\u201d\n\nAs its initial salvo, his group released a letter on Monday signed by 40 people ranging from CEOs or founders of companies like Lyft, Handy, Etsy and Instacart to venture capitalists to union leaders to academics and policy experts. \u201cEveryone, regardless of employment classification, should have access to the option of an affordable safety net that supports them when they\u2019re injured, sick, in need of professional growth, or when it\u2019s time to retire,\u201d they wrote.\n\nSeeking a New Way\n\nBenefits like workers\u2019 compensation, unemployment insurance, paid time off, retirement savings and training are now linked to traditional employment. Instead, the coalition\u2019s letter said, workers need a new, portable way to receive those benefits that would cover them no matter where and how they work. And there\u2019s a major precedent: The Affordable Care Act decoupled health insurance from employment.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to explore modernized, portable systems for people who do not have access to traditional benefits,\u201d said Lyft CEO Logan Green, one of the signatories, in a statement.\n\nIn a separate but related effort, an initiative called the Good Work Code on Friday launched a campaign to guide online companies into espousing eight values of ethical contract employment, such as a livable wage, safety, stability and opportunities for advancement. Initially 12 companies, ranging from Care.com, a public company with 7.7 million workers, to VetPronto, a startup that arranges house calls from some 20 vets and 25 veterinary assistants, signed on, but the backers hope it will spread widely.\n\n\u201cThe Good Work Code is a commonsense framework for companies,\u201d said Palak Shah, who is leading that initiative in her role as social innovations director at the National Domestic Workers Alliance. \u201cBy putting out this platform, we\u2019re finding our tribe of companies that want to embrace leadership in this area.\u201d\n\nWhile the code aims at the high-profile on-demand tech startups, its origins are in the alliance\u2019s more traditional constituency of house cleaners, nannies and caregivers. In recent years, new on-demand companies have disrupted that sector. \u201cWe found that people in the gig economy have similar issues to those we\u2019ve been dealing with for a long time for domestic workers, such as no benefits,\u201d Shah said. \u201cWe realized we have a wealth of expertise and perspective on what workers need and want.\u201d\n\nGraciela Salas provides in-home care for an Alzheimer\u2019s patient through CareLinx, which signed the Good Work Pledge. She makes $16.50 an hour, up from $12 an hour at a nursing home job, and feels that the company treats her well. She is a W-2 employee, but has the flexibility to set her own wages and schedule, and accept only assignments of her choosing.\n\nNeither the portable-benefits backers nor the Good Work Code tackle the hot-button issue of whether drivers for Uber, Lyft, Postmates, Caviar and other on-demand services should be reclassified as employees, rather than independent contractors. That\u2019s currently being hashed out in court. Instead, both groups aim for changes that are less controversial and more attainable.\n\nHandy.com CEO Oisin Hanrahan, who signed the flexible-benefits letter and faces a lawsuit over worker status, said he\u2019d like to offer more for Handy\u2019s 10,000 cleaners and fix-it folks, but feels hamstrung by current laws that provide only black-or-white choices of employee or independent contractor.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d love to see a form of safe harbor to allow platforms like ours to offer benefits, education and training,\u201d he said. \u201cToday we can\u2019t do that without triggering an employment reclassification.\u201d\n\nSeeking a National Debate\n\nThe coalition doesn\u2019t have specifics yet, but it wants to kick off a national debate about the issue. It sent its letter to selected lawmakers at the federal, state and local levels and hopes to hold a conference in Washington, D.C., later this year. With the current Congress hopelessly gridlocked, it may be up to California to blaze a trail for legislative action, some experts said.\n\n\u201cFlexible work should not come at the expense of economic security,\u201d said Assemblyman David Chiu, D-San Francisco, applauding the concept and the wide spectrum of supporters. \u201cI\u2019m very open to actively looking at what we can do in California to move this conversation forward.\u201d\n\nUber, by far the biggest gig economy company with 400,000 U.S. drivers, didn\u2019t sign the letter, but said it\u2019s open to the ideas. \u201cFlexibility and independence are important to workers, and technology platforms like ours provide both,\u201d a representative said. \u201cWe look forward to continuing this discussion.\u201d\n\nGood Work Code\n\nThis is the Good Work Code\u2019s explanation of its principles.\n\nSafety: Good work does not allow for workers to wonder at the start of a shift if they will be unharmed by the end. Everyone deserves to be safe at work, always.\n\nGood work does not allow for workers to wonder at the start of a shift if they will be unharmed by the end. Everyone deserves to be safe at work, always. Stability & Flexibility: Good work is made possible when workers are not anxious about life demands they are unable to meet, whether it\u2019s making an unexpected doctor\u2019s appointment or making enough money to pay the bills. We are all at our best when our schedules allow us to balance work and life with a stable \u2014 but flexible \u2014 schedule.\n\nGood work is made possible when workers are not anxious about life demands they are unable to meet, whether it\u2019s making an unexpected doctor\u2019s appointment or making enough money to pay the bills.

Transparency: Good work clears the way for workers to do a good job by being transparent about requirements, performance and the rules. When everyone knows how things work, everything works better, and that makes good business sense too.\n\nGood work clears the way for workers to do a good job by being transparent about requirements, performance and the rules.
