We found the stroke risk associated with acute cocaine use is much higher than some other stroke risk factors, such as diabetes, high blood pressure and smoking.\"\n\nThe study, which was presented at the American Stroke Association\u2019s International Stroke Conference in San Diego, surveyed data from about 1,000 stroke victims aged 15 to 49 in the Baltimore-Washington, D.C. area. This data was then compared to a control sample taken from the general population. Notably, more than one-fourth of both groups said they had done cocaine in the past.\n\nThe results were pretty sobering. Cheng and colleagues found that participants were six to seven times more likely to suffer a stroke within 24 hours of cocaine use. Now, this doesn\u2019t mean that a night of cocaine use will make you seven times more likely to suffer a stroke the next day compared to your sober friend (even though that\u2019s what it sounds like). What it means, however, is that there is a statistically salient relationship between coke and a serious disturbance of cerebral blood flow, which in turn provides a robust basis for a new health recommendation.\n\nAnd that recommendation is: Don\u2019t do coke, because it may give you a stroke.\n\nWhy, then, does cocaine boost this risk? We asked Dr. John W. Cole, a researcher at the Maryland Stroke Center and co-author of the study, who made it clear that the drug interferes with pretty much the entire spectrum of cardiovascular health. \u201cCocaine, through its actions as a central nervous system stimulant, increases stroke risk through a variety of mechanisms that alter normal cardiovascular and cerebrovascular tone and function,\u201d he said, citing something called a sympathomimetic effect that ratchets up blood pressure, heart rate, and other values you really want to keep within certain limits. \u201cIn such situations, a clot forms in the heart and then migrates (or embolizes) to the brain resulting in occluded brain blood vessels and cerebral ischemia (ischemic stroke).\u201d\n\nCheng added that, in light of this discovery, emergency rooms across the nation should start considering the relatively high probability of cocaine use in young ischemic stroke victims. \"Cocaine is not only addictive, it can also lead to disability or death from stroke,\" she said. \"With few exceptions, we believe every young stroke patient should be screened for drug abuse at the time of hospital admission.\u201d\n\nSource: Cheng Y, Qadwai SA, Ryan KA, Cole JW, Kittiner SJ.
