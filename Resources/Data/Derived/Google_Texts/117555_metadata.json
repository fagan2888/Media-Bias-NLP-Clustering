No, it\u2019s not the Greeks, or the Spanish or Portuguese, not the Irish or the Italians: It\u2019s the European Union itself, in whose name the fight to recover has been waged.\n\nWith Greece\u2019s debt crisis unresolved and with Prime Minister Cameron\u2019s landslide re-election in Britain last month, we now stare at two unthinkable scenarios: Greece\u2019s exit from the euro and the U.K.\u2019s from the E.U. altogether. A Grexit, destabilizing all by itself, threatens a chain reaction. A Brexit will remove one of the biggest stones in the union\u2019s foundation and could turn the English Channel into the world\u2019s sixth ocean.\n\nRelated: Tsipras Says Greece Not Intransigent, Urges EU Leaders To Reach Deal\n\nLet\u2019s not get too dire: Both of these questions could come good. But neither, at the moment, is heading in the right direction.\n\nThere have been other tough passages in the E.U.\u2019s history. In the 1960s, France bridled as supranational powers passed to Brussels and in proper Gaullist fashion, stood against Britain\u2019s membership in what was then the European Economic Community. Post-Berlin Wall enlargement and the Maastricht Treaty did not come easily. By the late 1990s, \u201ceuro-skepticism\u201d was a legitimate and too common term.\n\nIn my opinion, no past moment of difficulty since the seminal Treaty of Paris in 1951 equals the perils of this one. Misusing the word along with everyone else, the threat out in the middle distance looks a little existential.\n\nThe immediate facts of these two cases are plain enough.\n\nThe Tsipras government in Athens can\u2019t get a new debt deal out of Brussels that allows it to remain answerable to its electorate. Even if Greece makes its June payments of $1.8 billion on time, the now-strong possibility of a Grexit won\u2019t evaporate.\n\nRelated: Greece continues talks on aid, deal unlikely on Sunday\n\nSyriza, the anti-austerity party elected to power in January, is now split on the euro question. It wasn\u2019t six months ago, and the internal argument now\u2014desirable to no one\u2014is a consequence of the failure of Athens-E.U. talks thus far.\n\n\u201cThis is a dysfunctional union that doesn\u2019t serve the interests of most of its members,\u201d Costas Lapavitsas, a prominent Syriza parliamentarian, said in an interview published in the Los Angeles Times last week. \u201cTo me it\u2019s only a matter of time before this is recognized.\u201d\n\nOminous, especially given the rise of other populist parties\u2014in Spain, France, and elsewhere\u2014of either right or left persuasion.\n\nIn Britain, as soon as Cameron clinched his reelection it was clear his anti-European right wing was going to assume a new prominence. In no time, and no surprise, the British leader was hoofing it through Europe, completing a tour of the Netherlands, France, Poland, and Germany last Friday to gauge how difficult it will prove to negotiate a new deal for the U.K. within the union.\n\nDifficult, in a word. Suddenly, Brexit is front-burner stuff.\n\nRelated: France's Macron Does Not Rule Out Eventual EU Treaty Change\n\nCameron\u2019s dilemma is stark. He owes his electorate a referendum on E.U. membership or Brexit by 2017. Either he gets the Continent to accept a \u201cfull-on treaty change,\u201d as he put it last week, or he could prove to be the prime minister who ushered Britain out of the European project\u2014or back in time, if you prefer.\n\nThe French are against any treaty change at all, and Chancellor Merkel went only so far as to say it can\u2019t be \u201ccompletely ruled out.\u201d It\u2019s doubtful that\u2019s enough to let Cameron sleep well at night.\n\nApart from the pressing politics now weighing on the Greek crisis and 10 Downing Street, I see even more serious cause for worry on two counts. First, there are questions of history. Second, there is the failure of Brussels technocrats to register said questions.\n\nIn the case of Greece, you have a political culture with a long record of opposition to free market orthodoxies and a wide stripe of pink, scarlet, crimson, and every other shade of red running through it. Its ambiguous position between West and East has been a matter of record since Herodotus wrote The Histories.\n\nRelated: IMF's Chief Economist Says Euro Zone Could Cope With Grexit\n\nIn the British case one could arguably go back to the Norman Conquest, but let\u2019s keep the count to a few centuries. Gideon Rachman, the astute English columnist, took it all apart in a very fine explainer in the Financial Times last week.\n\n\u201cBritain\u2019s debate about Europe echoes arguments that were taking place nearly 300 years ago, when Sir Robert Walpole became the first prime minister,\u201d Rachman writes. \u201cRobert Tombs, the Cambridge historian, notes that Walpole, a Whig, believed Britain should play a \u2018major role in Europe,\u2019 while his Tory opposition preferred \u2018overseas trade, not European commitments.\u2019\u201d\n\nHistory, political and cultural traditions, what we might get away with calling national sentiment\u2014these things can\u2019t be ignored in a project as complex as Europe\u2019s since 1945. Gaullism falls in this file and it caused problems. Now it\u2019s right-wing Toryism and Greek leftists with long memories and a lot of pride.\n\nNo surprise these things now weigh very heavily on the E.U.\u2019s future. The surprise is that Brussels has been so wrong for so long in its approach to European integration.\n\nRelated: 'Brexit' Would Be Bad For Business \u2013Lloyd's Of London CEO\n\nTechnocrats have long directed the European project, and therein lies the error. They\u2019re trained in liberal economics but not history, politics, or cultural studies. This renders them ill-equipped. The task should never have been to erase all difference\u2014we will all eat bananas of the same shape\u2014but to recognize and accommodate difference.\n\nIn practical terms, Brussels should have been assigned less power and Strasbourg, where the European Parliament sits, more. Ask yourself, when was the last time you read news of some big decision or policy datelined \u201cStrasbourg?\u201d\n\nI rate problems of history and institutional design deep sources of concern because they\u2019re very hard to address and no one\u2019s seems to be doing so. The Greeks may find a way through, and the British may decide to remain in the European family. One hopes so.\n\nBut the Grexit and Brexit questions are merely symptoms. The underlying malady is Europe as it\u2019s now conceived and constituted.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "A step at a time over the past seven years, the true victim of financial, economic, so", "title": "Greece, Britain, and the EU: A Tale of Two Exits?", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2015/06/01/Greece-Britain-and-EU-Tale-Two-Exits", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/cnews-us-eurozone-greece-imf_2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2015/06/01/Greece-Britain-and-EU-Tale-Two-Exits", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/cnews-us-eurozone-greece-imf_2.jpg", "creator": "@psmith7600", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "A step at a time over the past seven years, the true victim of financial, economic, so", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1f23\"", "article_summary": "Related: France's Macron Does Not Rule Out Eventual EU Treaty ChangeCameron\u2019s dilemma is stark.\nRelated: Tsipras Says Greece Not Intransigent, Urges EU Leaders To Reach DealLet\u2019s not get too dire: Both of these questions could come good.\nEven if Greece makes its June payments of $1.8 billion on time, the now-strong possibility of a Grexit won\u2019t evaporate.\nIn Britain, as soon as Cameron clinched his reelection it was clear his anti-European right wing was going to assume a new prominence.\nRelated: Greece continues talks on aid, deal unlikely on SundaySyriza, the anti-austerity party elected to power in January, is now split on the euro question."}
