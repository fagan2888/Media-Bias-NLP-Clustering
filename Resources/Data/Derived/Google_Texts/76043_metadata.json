They've gone after so-called pill mills and doctors who are chronically over-prescribing strong painkillers.\n\n\"I think they\u2019re still training doctors to focus too much on the use of opioid as a pain relief when in fact I think the risks are starting outweigh some of the rewards,\" Zoeller said.\n\nHe calls these grants the \u201ctriage phase\u201d of reducing the number of people fatally overdosing on opioids and heroin. \"What I\u2019m calling a surge in Naloxone distribution and training,\" he said.\n\nThe grants total $127,000, going to three nonprofits working in 16 of the hardest-hit counties, including Marion County and Scott County where an HIV outbreak last year began to shed light on the opioid addiction epidemic.\n\nMoney will be used to train and supply first responders on how to use naloxone, a drug that counteracts the effects of an opioid overdose. It\u2019s been used more than a hundred times by police officers in Indianapolis to resurrect overdosers.\n\nThe money comes from settlements with pharmaceutical companies over deceptive marketing of drugs.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "heroin, Greg Zoeller, drug overdose, naloxone", "pubdate": "2016-01-07", "author": "Ryan Delaney", "og": {"site_name": "WFYI Public Media", "description": "The Indiana attorney general is putting a \u201csurge\u201d of heroin and opioid antidote into communities to combat a rising number of overdose deaths.", "title": "Attorney General Putting 'Surge' of Opioid Antidote in Hard-Hit Communities", "url": "http://www.wfyi.org/news/articles/attorney-general-putting-surge-of-opioid-antidote-in-hard-hit-communities", "image": "http://www.wfyi.org/files/wfyi/articles/current/narcan-kit-1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Indiana attorney general is putting a \u201csurge\u201d of heroin and opioid antidote into communities to combat a rising number of overdose deaths.", "creator": "@rpatrickdelaney", "image": {"src": "http://www.wfyi.org/files/wfyi/articles/current/narcan-kit-1.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.wfyi.org/files/wfyi/articles/current/narcan-kit-1.jpg"}, "title": "Attorney General Putting 'Surge' of Opioid Antidote in Hard-Hit Communities", "site": "@WFYINews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "Index,Follow,NoArchive", "owner": "WFYI", "date": "2016-01-07", "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-07T00:00:00-05:00"}, "KEYWORDS": "heroin, Greg Zoeller, drug overdose, naloxone", "thumbnail": "http://www.wfyi.org/files/wfyi/articles/medium/narcan-kit-1.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "The Indiana attorney general is putting a \u201csurge\u201d of heroin and opioid antidote into communities to combat a rising number of overdose deaths."}, "article_summary": "INDIANAPOLIS -- The Indiana attorney general is putting a \u201csurge\u201d of heroin and opioid antidote into communities to combat a rising number of overdose deaths.\n\"We can\u2019t stand idly by as more Hoosiers are lost to overdoses,\" Attorney General Greg Zoeller said at a statehouse press conference Thursday.\nMoney will be used to train and supply first responders on how to use naloxone, a drug that counteracts the effects of an opioid overdose.\nThe attorney general's office has been trying to reduce the over prescribing of powerful painkillers which can lead to heroin addictions.\nHe calls these grants the \u201ctriage phase\u201d of reducing the number of people fatally overdosing on opioids and heroin."}
