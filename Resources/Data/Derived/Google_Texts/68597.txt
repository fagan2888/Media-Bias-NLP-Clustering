A reporter from Israel’s NRG spent a day walking the streets of Paris wearing a yarmulke. A hidden camera following him shows that he was spit at, called a “dog” and a “homo,” and had a man scream at him that “Palestine will win.”

The video plays off the theme of a video made last year that showed the treatment of a woman as she walked silently on the streets of New York City.

The video by NRG ends with the statistic that there were 851 anti-Semitic attacks reported in Paris in 2014, making it the most anti-Semitic country in Western Europe.
