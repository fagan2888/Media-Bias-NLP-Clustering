He recounted the fear and anger within an agency he said had been \u201cringing the bell\u201d on the al-Qaida threat \u201cfor many months,\u201d and the sudden rush to arms to prevent potential further attacks.\n\nThe CIA's response included getting authorization from the White House and Department of Justice to use what the agency refers to as \"enhanced interrogation techniques\" and what others consider methods of torture.\n\n\u201cThe previous administration faced agonizing choices over how to pursue al-Qaida and prevent additional attacks against our country,\u201d Brennan said. \u201cThere were no easy answers.
