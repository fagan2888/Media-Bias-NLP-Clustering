According to a Fox News poll released on Wednesday, a majority of Americans are giving President Barack Obama failing grades on several important issues, among them the economy, creating jobs, healthcare and the country's image abroad.

For the very first time in a Fox News poll, less than four out of ten Americans, 38 percent, approve of the way the president is handling his job. This latest rating is down from 43 percent on January 28, 2014, just before Obama's State of the Union address.

The publics perception of the president's handling of foreign affairs took a hit, according to the poll results. Obama had a big selling point when he campaigned to improve the country's image, but the Ukraine-Russia conflict is on everyone's mind now. A record 59 percent of those polled disapprove of the president's handling of foreign affairs.

Job creation is a stickler in everyone's throat, with a 59 percent majority saying Obama has failed at creating jobs. It is also felt by 56 percent that the White House has failed at growing the economy. Jobs and the economy tie-in with transparency in government, and 59 percent of voters polled say there is no transparency in Obama's administration.

Healthcare, and in particular, Obamacare is and has been an issue with the American public. Fully 59 percent of respondents disapprove of the way the administration has handled healthcare. Oversight in the $1.8 trillion spent on Obamacare is in question, with calls for an investigation into where the money has gone, according to Fox News today.

This latest poll was conducted by Anderson Robbins Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R) using live telephone interviewers on March 2-4, 2014. A random sampling of 1,002 voters was used, with a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points.
