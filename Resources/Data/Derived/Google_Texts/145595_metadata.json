Increasing the minimum wage is a perfect example. Raising it increases the living standards for those who struggle earning such a wage, and those who are against it\u2013Republicans\u2013are just anti-poor cretins who have no heart. The political campaign almost sells itself. Yet, we\u2019re against it not because we hate poor people\u2013that\u2019s unadulterated nonsense. We\u2019re against it because hurts workers, which is something that we\u2019ve been saying ad nauseum, but alas, liberal intransigence and stubbornness on this issue has resulted in over 700,000 jobs being cut over the past couple years.\n\nPiggybacking off Daniel\u2019s post last week, Seattle\u2019s progressives have seen their minimum wage increase blow up in their faces. Workers are now demanding fewer hours. Why? The city\u2019s $15 minimum wage law means that they\u2019re ineligible for other welfare services. So, the burden of the law falls entirely on the employer, with the employees wanting to work less so they can remain on the government programs. It is laziness or just immaturity; that being you have to pay more in taxes and are ineligible for certain programs once you start making more money? That\u2019s a debate for another time.\n\nThe American Action Forum has provided an analysis of the minimum wage and other economic policies from the Obama administration, which was supposedly meant to help the middle class. Spoiler alert: it hasn\u2019t:\n\nIn 2013 High Minimum Wages Cost 747,700 Jobs: In 2013 a $1 increase in the minimum wage was associated with a 1.48 percent increase in the unemployment rate, which amounted to 747,700 jobs. States with minimum wages above the federal standard are lagging behind their counterparts by a full percentage point. The increases will lead to fewer jobs for those who need them the most. The jobs lost from minimum wage hikes are almost entirely low-wage jobs. [\u2026] According to a study by Jeffrey Clemens and Michael Wither from the University of California San Diego, the last time the federal minimum wage increased (from $5.15 to $7.25), employment among those earning less than $7.50 decreased by 8% nationally. That amounted to 1.7 million fewer jobs. As a result, average monthly income fell by $100. Read more here for fascinating data on its effect on mobility, poverty, and unpaid work. [\u2026] The Affordable Care Act has reshaped American healthcare and affected the middle class, but not in a positive way financially. Small businesses have been some of the hardest hit. AAF research found that Obamacare has reduced the wages of small business workers (offices with 20-99 employees) by $22.6 billion annually and cost those small businesses 350,000 jobs. The ACA has also led to workers\u2019 hours being cut. As Nate Silver\u2019s 538 site wrote this past January, \u201cthe evidence suggests [the Affordable Care Act] has led some employers to limit the hours of workers who were already part-time, effectively giving a pay cut to some of the most vulnerable Americans.\u201d\n\nWelcome to Obama\u2019s America.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "You know, I just can\u2019t believe it (sarc.)", "title": "Oh, that time raising the minimum wage gutted over 700,000 jobs", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2015/07/28/oh-that-time-raising-the-minimum-wage-gutted-over-700000-jobs/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@JazzShaw"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-29T00:41:26+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-28T22:22:08+00:00"}, "keywords": "minimum wage,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "article_summary": "Piggybacking off Daniel\u2019s post last week, Seattle\u2019s progressives have seen their minimum wage increase blow up in their faces.\nThe jobs lost from minimum wage hikes are almost entirely low-wage jobs.\nOh, that time raising the minimum wage gutted over 700,000 jobsposted at 8:41 pm on July 28, 2015 by Matt VespaAre liberals better at economics or are they just more adept at selling ideas that drive purely on emotion?\nThe city\u2019s $15 minimum wage law means that they\u2019re ineligible for other welfare services.\nStates with minimum wages above the federal standard are lagging behind their counterparts by a full percentage point."}
