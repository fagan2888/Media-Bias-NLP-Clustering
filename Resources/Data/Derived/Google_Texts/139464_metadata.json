This is what\u2019s known as the \u201cpay per volume\u201d model. Such a system can have unintended consequences.\n\n\u201cIn the past, if doing the right thing has meant not doing some specific part of a process, then you\u2019d be giving up payment for that part, because every part had a payment attached to it,\u201d Keith Mueller, Ph.D., a professor of health management and policy at the University of Iowa College of Public Health, told Healthline.\n\nRead More: Medicare Penalties Take Heavier Toll on Hospitals with the Most Vulnerable Patients \u00bb\n\n\u2018Bundled\u2019 Payments Focus on Quality\n\nThe new CMS \u201cbundled\u201d payment model will focus on the quality of care more than the quantity.\n\nThe CMS will continue to pay surgeons, physical therapists, rehab facilities, and others involved in patient care separately for each service.\n\nHowever, the CMS will also track the overall cost of patient care provided by hospitals, surgeons, nursing homes, and home health agencies for up to 90 days after the start of care.\n\nIf this bundled cost falls under a target price the CMS sets for each hospital, the CMS will pay the hospital a bonus.\n\nHowever, if patients have complications or end up staying longer in the hospital or rehabilitation facility, hospitals could have to pay back part of that bundled payment to Medicare.\n\nThese changes will not affect all hospitals in the country.\n\nMedicare is rolling out the program known as the Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement (CJR) model for hospitals in 67 areas.\n\nThese hospitals account for about one-third of hip and knee replacements covered by Medicare.\n\nRead More: Medicare Penalties: The Search for Value-Based Care \u00bb\n\nReducing Complications from Surgery\n\nWhether quality of care or cost control is behind these changes is up for debate.\n\n\u201cIn theory, it\u2019s a combination of the two,\u201d said Mueller. \u201cHaving said that, the clear policy motivation at this point is cost because that\u2019s the part of the healthcare field that is getting a lot of attention and it seems to still be uncontrolled.\u201d\n\nThe CMS hopes the program will save $343 million in the next five years. That amount would be part of the expected $12 billion to be spent on major leg procedures.\n\nOne reason the CMS is targeting hip and knee replacements is because they involve straightforward medical care for older Americans.\n\nIn 2014, more than 400,000 people with Medicare received a hip or knee replacement, and both the cost and quality of these procedures varied among hospitals.\n\nAccording to CMS, some hospitals have rates of complications, such as infections or implant failures after surgery, that are more than three times higher than other hospitals.\n\nLikewise, the cost of surgery, hospitalization, and recovery in different areas can be as low as $16,500 or as high as $33,000 for the same procedure.\n\nRead More: Medicare Penalties: Trying to Stop Hospital Infections \u00bb\n\nQuality vs. Cost Control\n\nAlthough cost garners the most attention, it\u2019s not necessarily separate from quality of care.\n\n\u201c[This payment model] should also have an impact on quality,\u201d said Mueller, \u201cbecause you start being more careful how you\u2019re measuring the outcomes of a hip replacement or a knee replacement.\u201d\n\nHospitals receive a set amount for the overall care of a patient. The CMS hopes this will encourage more mindfulness on how hospitals approach these procedures.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really more the carrot than it is the stick,\u201d said Mueller, \u201cbecause you are changing from incentives to simply do more to do more ... to doing the optimum and doing the right thing and getting paid for that.\u201d\n\nWith a strong financial incentive, hospitals may steer patients toward post-surgery care that is both high quality and cost effective.\n\nLike the previous payment model, bundled payments could have unforeseen ripple effects.\n\nHospitals may buy up post-surgery care facilities to give them greater control over patients\u2019 recovery leading to more consolidation in the healthcare system.\n\nThat\u2019s not the only option, though, for hospitals to survive this shift.\n\n\u201cThere are other ways besides consolidation into a big system with single ownership,\u201d said Mueller. \u201c[Hospitals] can do it by affiliation agreements. They can do it by working with care coordinators, whether or not those coordinators are part of their own system.\u201d\n\nHospitals may also stop performing hip and knee replacement surgeries on people who are more likely to make poor recoveries.\n\nObesity, diabetes, and smoking all increase a patient\u2019s risk of complications. Many of these risks, though, can be reduced with lifestyle changes.\n\nNYU Langone Medical Center in New York City is part of the voluntary test of the CJR model.\n\nLifestyle modifications are good for patients over the short and long term. However, given more data hospitals may be start to refuse to operate on patients that are a high risk and unwilling to improve their health before surgery.\n\nRead More: Understanding Knee Replacement Costs: What's On the Bill? \u00bb\n\nSome Hesitant About Payment Shift\n\nRight now the CMS is only switching to mandatory bundled payments for hip and knee replacements. But this one change could still have an impact on hospitals and other healthcare organizations.\n\n\u201cHealthcare payment policies that affect only 5, 10, 15 percent of the total payment tend to have a pretty dramatic impact,\u201d said Mueller, \u201cbecause the margins that a lot of the healthcare providers operate under are narrow.\u201d\n\nSo when Medicare payments shift, hospitals listen, especially when the changes are mandatory.\n\nIf you start affecting even a small percentage of hospitals\u2019 total revenue stream, you get a lot of attention from them. Keith Mueller, University of Iowa College of Public Health\n\n\u201cIf you start affecting even a small percentage of hospitals\u2019 total revenue stream,\u201d said Mueller, \u201cyou get a lot of attention from them.\u201d\n\nNot all of this attention is good.\n\nHospital and behavioral-health company Universal Health Services told Modern Healthcare in February that it was considering dropping out of the CMS\u2019s voluntary test of bundled payments \u201cuntil some of the kinks are worked out.\u201d\n\nThis voluntary testing of bundled payments has been underway since 2013 as part of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). It includes 48 conditions, such as diabetes, heart attacks, renal failure, and stroke.\n\nAs of today, bundled payments for hip and knee replacements are mandatory for affected hospitals.\n\nLast week, two House members from Georgia introduced a bill in Congress that would delay mandatory bundled payments until 2018, saying it \u201ccomes with tremendous risk and complexity for patients and healthcare providers.\u201d\n\nThat didn\u2019t come in time for the April start date. This leaves many people watching to see if the new system produces unexpected negative side effects, or if the quality of care actually improves for patients undergoing hip or knee replacement surgery.", "article_metadata": {"standout": "http://www.healthline.com/health-news/new-medicare-rules-for-hip-knee-replacements", "news_keywords": "hip surgery, knee surgery, new rules for hip knee surgery, new payments for hip knee surgery, Medicare hip knee surgery changes", "og": {"site_name": "Healthline", "description": "Medicare has started paying hospitals for the quality \u2014 not quantity \u2014 of care that patients undergoing hip or knee replacement surgery receive.", "title": "New Medicare Payment Rules for Hip, Knee Replacements Take Effect Today", "url": "http://www.healthline.com/health-news/new-medicare-rules-for-hip-knee-replacements", "image": "http://www.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/040116_Hip_Knee_Surgeries_THUMB.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/040116_Hip_Knee_Surgeries_THUMB.jpg", "description": "Medicare has started paying hospitals for the quality \u2014 not quantity \u2014 of care that patients undergoing hip or knee replacement surgery receive.", "card": "summary", "title": "New Medicare Payment Rules for Hip, Knee Replacements Take Effect Today"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP", "DC.date.issued": "2016-04-01", "fb": {"app_id": 239371929577489}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Medicare has started paying hospitals for the quality \u2014 not quantity \u2014 of care that patients undergoing hip or knee replacement surgery receive."}, "article_summary": "\u00bbSome Hesitant About Payment ShiftRight now the CMS is only switching to mandatory bundled payments for hip and knee replacements.\nOne reason the CMS is targeting hip and knee replacements is because they involve straightforward medical care for older Americans.\nAs of today, bundled payments for hip and knee replacements are mandatory for affected hospitals.\nThese hospitals account for about one-third of hip and knee replacements covered by Medicare.\nMany people know someone who has had a hip or knee replaced, or they may have gone through a major leg procedure themselves."}
