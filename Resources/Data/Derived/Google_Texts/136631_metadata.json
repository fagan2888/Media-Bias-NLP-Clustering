Grantcharov, a professor of surgery at the University of Toronto, has developed a \"black box\" that aligns patients' physical data to audio and video recordings, giving surgeons access to an \"instant replay\" of a procedure. Grantcharov told the Post two American hospital systems have agreed to test the device.\n\nMeanwhile, legislation introduced in Wisconsin would require cameras in every operating room in the state in the wake of Wisconsin woman Julie Ayer Rubenzer's death from being given excessive amounts of the anesthetic propofol during a breast enhancement surgery, according to the article. Cameras also could discourage clinicians from disruptive or disrespectful behavior, as in the recent case of a patient who inadvertently recorded his surgical team mocking him, Rubenzer's brother Wade Ayer, who helped draft the bill, told the Post.\n\nWithout recordings, determining exactly where a procedure went wrong means trying to piece it together with a combination of notes and potentially faulty memories. Ayer said. Recording them, on the other hand, \"offers transparency, truth and accuracy in collecting data for the medical record and testimony,\" he added. \"It offers data and insight for medical boards and even prosecutors. It offers oversight and policing.\"\n\nThe hospital industry may be a tougher sell on the idea. Current American Medical Association policy encourages filming procedures for educational purposes, but only with explicit patient consent. And in other cases, the industry, wary of lawsuits, has actively stymied the movement to record procedures. The hospital lobby in Massachusetts has led the fight against repeated attempts to require providers to allow recording by a licensed videographer, according to the article.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- here's the article\n\n- check out the bill\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nStudy: Medical errors affect surgeons personally, professionally\n\nTechnology mishaps account for one-fourth of OR errors\n\nAnesthesiologist must pay $500K for insulting man under sedation\n\n3 ways hospitals can reduce medical errors\n\nTips to improve patient handoffs, outcomes\n\nStudy: Involving patients in nurses' shift change improves outcomes, prevents errors\n\nHospital medical errors now the third leading cause of death in the U.S.\n\nHospital errors not budging", "article_metadata": {"description": "Reducing medical errors is a major priority for the healthcare industry, and now legislators and patient safety advocates are exploring a potential solution to the problem: Cameras in the operating room.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Reducing medical errors is a major priority for the healthcare industry, and now legislators and patient safety advocates are exploring a potential solution to the problem: Cameras in the operating room.", "title": "Could recording surgeries reduce medical errors?", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/could-recording-surgeries-reduce-medical-errors/2015-08-26", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "American Medical Association,Care Delivery,healthcare transparency,Legal / Regulatory / Risk Management,malpractice,medical errors,Patient Care & Outcomes,patient safety,video recording,Wisconsin", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Legal / Regulatory / Risk Management,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "article_summary": "To learn more:- here's the article- check out the billRelated Articles:Study: Medical errors affect surgeons personally, professionallyTechnology mishaps account for one-fourth of OR errorsAnesthesiologist must pay $500K for insulting man under sedation3 ways hospitals can reduce medical errorsTips to improve patient handoffs, outcomesStudy: Involving patients in nurses' shift change improves outcomes, prevents errorsHospital medical errors now the third leading cause of death in the U.S.Hospital errors not budging\nRecording them, on the other hand, \"offers transparency, truth and accuracy in collecting data for the medical record and testimony,\" he added.\n\"It offers data and insight for medical boards and even prosecutors.\nReducing medical errors is a major priority for the healthcare industry, and now legislators and patient safety advocates are exploring a potential solution to the problem: Cameras in the operating room.\nThe hospital industry may be a tougher sell on the idea."}
