Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania discusses consolidation in health care and weighs in on whether it's right to have a third of brewers in this country to be owned by one company.\n\nMergers and acquisitions by energy companies, technology giants like IBM and even hotel chains have recently peppered the news.\n\nPharmacy chain Walgreens Boots Alliance announced Tuesday it would buy Rite Aid for $9 per share in an all-cash deal.
