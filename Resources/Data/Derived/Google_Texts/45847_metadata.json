Nearly half of students who started college in 2009 still hadn\u2019t graduated four years later, according to a new report by the National Student Clearinghouse Center.\n\nThe report found that 52.9 percent of college students in the 2009 cohort received a degree within six years of enrollment, a 2.1 percentage point decline from the previous year. At public four-year schools, the six-year graduation rate was 61.2 percent, while the rate at private schools was 71.5 percent. The graduation rate for students at two-year programs was much lower at 38.1 percent, down from 39.1 percent for the 2008 cohort.\n\nRelated: 10 Public Colleges with the Worst Graduation Rates\n\nPart-time students had the lowest completion rates and the highest dropout rates. Despite the lower college completion rate, more students graduated from college during the period, since overall enrollment increased during the worst of the Great Recession.\n\nOne reason that students are failing to complete college may be a lack of preparation in secondary school, according to a paper released last year by the National Center for Analysis of Longitudinal Data in Education Research, titled \u201cAmerica\u2019s College Drop-Out Epidemic: Understanding the College Drop-Out Population.\u201d\n\n\u201cAdministrators and policy makers should use caution when assuming the best way to increase postsecondary degree attainment is to increase college enrollment,\u201d author Erin Dunlop Velez argues. \u201cGiven current levels of academic preparation in secondary schools, many students are not prepared for success at four-year, and even two-year colleges.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "One of the nuances often lost in the discussion of student loan debt\u00a0 is the plight of", "title": "Here\u2019s Why the College Graduation Rate Is So Low", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/11/17/Here-s-Why-College-Graduation-Rate-So-Low", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/092222011_Lost_Graduate_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/11/17/Here-s-Why-College-Graduation-Rate-So-Low", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/092222011_Lost_Graduate_article.jpg", "creator": "@bethbrav", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "One of the nuances often lost in the discussion of student loan debt\u00a0 is the plight of", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "At public four-year schools, the six-year graduation rate was 61.2 percent, while the rate at private schools was 71.5 percent.\nThe graduation rate for students at two-year programs was much lower at 38.1 percent, down from 39.1 percent for the 2008 cohort.\nDespite the lower college completion rate, more students graduated from college during the period, since overall enrollment increased during the worst of the Great Recession.\nRelated: 10 Public Colleges with the Worst Graduation RatesPart-time students had the lowest completion rates and the highest dropout rates.\nThe report found that 52.9 percent of college students in the 2009 cohort received a degree within six years of enrollment, a 2.1 percentage point decline from the previous year."}
