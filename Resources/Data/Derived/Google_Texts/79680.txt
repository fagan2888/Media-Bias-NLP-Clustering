Needing immediate help to prop up a sagging bullpen, and with an eye toward their future, the Rockies designated veteran reliever Rafael Betancourt for assignment Sunday.

Betancourt, 40, has pitched his last game for the Rockies and admitted that retiring from baseball is a possibility.

“I always like to be honest with myself,” Betancourt said. “I’m 40 years old, I wasn’t pitching good and I don’t see any teams or contenders looking (to pick him up),” Betancourt said.

The Rockies also optioned right-handed reliever Justin Miller to Triple-A Albuquerque, recalled right-handed reliever Jairo Diaz from Triple-A and selected the contract of right-handed reliever Simon Castro.

Both Castro and Diaz were available for Sunday afternoon’s game against the New York Mets.

The Rockies also reinstated right-handed reliever Brooks Brown (shoulder inflammation) from the 15-day disabled list and optioned him to Albuquerque.

Betancourt was 2-4 with one save in four opportunities and a 6.18 ERA in 45 appearances for the Rockies this season. He was clearly struggling toward the end of his tenure with Colorado.

Though he had developed a better changeup than he’d ever had before, Betancourt’s fastball command was not as sharp as used to be. Betancourt lived by moving the ball in and out, and painting the corners of the plate, but once he lost that ability, he struggled to put hitters away.

“This is kind of where where we are at right now, with the state of our bullpen,” manager Walt Weiss said. “We need to get a look at some guys down the stretch and look toward the future and look at the bigger picture.”

Weiss said that calling Betancourt into his office Sunday morning to break the news was not easy, but Weiss went out of his way to praise Betancourt, who returned from Tommy John surgery to make the team this spring.

“I think it’s pretty remarkable what Raffy accomplished this year,” Weiss said. “To be honest with you, going into spring training I thought there was very little chance we would see him in a big-league game this year. He not only did that, he made our club, broke camp with us and played a major role the entire season.

“So that’s a tough conversation to have with a guy like that. He’s been a warrior and he’s been a great leader. He’s got a lot to be proud of when he looks back at his career.”

In 680 appearances across 12 seasons from 2003-15 with Cleveland and Colorado, Betancourt posted a 38-37 record with 75 saves in 121 opportunities and a 3.36 ERA. His 58 saves with the Rockies rank fifth in franchise history.

After undergoing Tommy John on Sept. 17, 2013, he pitched in the minors in 2014. He made the Rockies’ opening-day roster this season as a non-roster invitee.

“I have always respected the people here,” he said. “They have always treated me very well. I saw this coming. They are going to be needing young guys.”

Castro, 27, pitched in four games for the Chicago White Sox during the 2013 season. He was 0-1 with a 2.70 ERA (6.2 IP, 2 ER) in four relief appearances after making his big-league debut on July 5, 2013.

He was signed by the Rockies to a minor-league contract on April 22, 2014. He underwent Tommy John surgery in January 2014, forcing him to miss all of the 2014 season. He was 5-5 with a 3.79 ERA in 36 appearances at Triple-A this season.

Diaz, 24, was 3-5 with a 4.58 ERA in 47 relief appearances for the Isotopes this season. He has eight saves in 14 opportunities.

Diaz, who throws a fastball in the high 90s, was acquired by the Rockies from the Angels in a trade for infielder Josh Rutledge on Dec. 10, 2014. Diaz was originally signed by Los Angeles as a non-drafted free agent on Aug. 1, 2007.

Looking ahead

Rockies’ Jorge De La Rosa (7-5, 4.50 ERA) at Braves’ Julio Teheran (8-6, 4.32), 5:10 p.m. Monday, ROOT; 850 AM

De La Rosa, the veteran left-hander, has turned into the Rockies’ tourniquet — he’s expected to stop the bleeding. The Rockies have lost 12 of their last 15 games and own the worst record in the majors. De La Rosa has gained acclaim for being the best pitcher in Coors Field history, but he has been impressive on the road this season, going 5-3 with a 3.17 ERA in 10 starts. Teheran, meanwhile, has struggled on the road but has pitched well at Turner Field (6-1, 2.44). In his last outing, he struck out seven and walked one while holding the Padres to one run on four hits over six innings in a no-decision at Petco Park.

Tuesday: Rockies’ Chad Bettis (5-4, 4.88 ERA) at Braves’ Mike Foltynewicz (4-5, 6.06), 5:10 p.m., ROOT

Wednesday: Rockies’ Yohan Flande (3-1, 3.94) at Braves’ Shelby Miller (5-10, 2.50), 5:10 p.m., ROOT

Thursday: Off
