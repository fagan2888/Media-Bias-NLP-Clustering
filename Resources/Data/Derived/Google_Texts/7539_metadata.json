Because what\u2019s the point of wearing sunscreen when it\u2019s not actually protecting you from anything? Roughly a third of tested sunscreens failed to deliver the amount of SPF protection their labels said.\n\nTesting the sunscreens specifically against UVA and UVB rays, the consumer watchdog magazine applied the sunscreens onto participants\u2019 backs and then submerged them in water for the amount of time the labels said they\u2019d be protected \u2014 an hour, for example. Once that time was over, the participants were exposed to the rays in order to determine how effective the sunscreens were.\n\nThe magazine used sunscreens that ranged in price points from drugstore brands to European skin care products. Out of 34 tested water-resistant sunscreens, 11 provided protection 16 to 70 percent below what their labels said. For example, Yes to Cucumbers Natural Sunscreen claimed an SPF of 30, but only provided an SPF of 14. Meanwhile, CVS\u2019 Baby Pure and Gentle Lotion with an SPF of 60 only averaged an SPF of 18, while Vanicream Broad Spectrum claimed an SPF of 50 and up, but only averaged an SPF of 17.\n\n\u201cOur findings are troubling because consumers may not be getting the amount of SPF they think they\u2019re getting,\u201d Trisha Calvo, health and food deputy content editor for Consumer Reports, told the NY Post.\n\nThe magazine also found an issue with so-called \u201cnatural\u201d sunscreens, which are typically made with either zinc oxide or titanium dioxide, or both. Only two of five tested met SPF claims, and still, they didn\u2019t score high enough to be recommended to consumers \u2014 these were California Baby Super Sensitive SPF 30+ and Goddess Garden Organics Sunny Body Natural 30, Yahoo Health reported. Despite being marketed as less likely to irritate skin, Consumer Reports said they were also \u201cless likely to provide protection from cancer-causing UVA and UVB rays.\u201d\n\nIn response to the study, the Personal Care Products Council, a trade group representing sunscreen brands, said Consumer Reports used a testing method different from the FDA\u2019s official sunscreen test. It\u2019s unclear whether or not this is true.\n\nThe American Cancer Society predicts there will be an additional 73,000 cases of melanoma skin cancer in the U.S. by the end of 2015. Though it\u2019s only a small portion of the 3.5 million cases of skin cancer in the U.S., it\u2019s also the most aggressive form, responsible for 10,000 of over 13,000 deaths. Sunscreen is integral to protecting ourselves from the sun, but so is avoiding the sun at its hottest hours of the day and wearing clothing to protect the skin.\n\nHere\u2019s a list of Consumer Reports\u2019 top 15 sunscreen choices for 2015:", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "some, sunscreens, perform, below, spf, protection, claims, increasing, risk, sun, exposure", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A new study from Consumer Reports finds nearly a third of sunscreens tested had SPF protection lower than what their labels claimed.", "title": "Some Sunscreens May Protect Less Than You Thought: Report", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/some-sunscreens-perform-below-spf-protection-claims-increasing-risk-sun-exposure-333702", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/05/16/sunscreen.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A new study from Consumer Reports finds nearly a third of sunscreens tested had SPF protection lower than what their labels claimed.", "title": "Some Sunscreens May Protect Less Than You Thought: Report", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/some-sunscreens-perform-below-spf-protection-claims-increasing-risk-sun-exposure-333702", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/05/16/sunscreen.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/05/16/sunscreen.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Vitality", "published_time": "2015-05-16T16:19:12-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-18T10:33:19-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A new study from Consumer Reports finds nearly a third of sunscreens tested had SPF protection lower than what their labels claimed."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd924c\"", "article_summary": "A new study from Consumer Reports finds nearly a third of sunscreens tested had SPF protection lower than what their labels claimed.\nRoughly a third of tested sunscreens failed to deliver the amount of SPF protection their labels said.\nA new Consumer Reports study suggests some of our pandering about the importance of sunscreen may have been for nothing.\nOut of 34 tested water-resistant sunscreens, 11 provided protection 16 to 70 percent below what their labels said.\nFor example, Yes to Cucumbers Natural Sunscreen claimed an SPF of 30, but only provided an SPF of 14."}
