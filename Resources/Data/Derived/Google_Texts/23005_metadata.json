But in light of foreseeable tax problems associated with auto-renewal, Covered California also hopes to keep consumers informed.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times reports that California\u2019s 10 insurers will be sending renewal information to consumers during the last two weeks of October. \u201cHealth plans are working with Covered California to streamline renewals,\u201d the President of an industry trade group told the Times.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nPart of the streamlining is the auto-renewal process, which will allow anyone who wants to keep their plan to do so without doing much. In fact, those who don\u2019t choose a different plan will be auto-renewed on December 15th.\n\nHowever, as discussed at length here, there is a problem associated with auto-renewal. Obamacare subsidies not only vary based upon a person\u2019s changing income level, but also based upon the benchmark plan available in the exchange. The benchmark plan is defined as the 2nd cheapest silver plan available. If the cost of that plan drops, those who auto-renew into their old plan (which is now above the cost of the benchmark) could find out later they owe the IRS money.\n\nThis problem could be avoided by advising everyone to shop for a new plan every year, but obviously that wouldn\u2019t be very user-friendly. According to a spokesperson for Covered California, the state is trying to walk a line between making it easy and also keeping people fully informed.\n\nIn practice that means no one will be able to auto-renew by doing nothing. At a minimum, each person will have to grant Covered CA the ability to verify their income on a federal database before renewing. Those who fail to approve the income check lose their access to subsidies on the exchange. Obviously, with 90% of consumers getting subsidies that would be a big problem. The details of how this income approval will work aren\u2019t fully fleshed out yet, but it will be a requirement.\n\nHaving people verify their income is one way to help reduce unexpected changes in subsidy amounts which could lead to tax problems. In addition, Covered CA will be encouraging every consumer to check his or her plan on the website\u2019s shopping tool to make sure their subsidies haven\u2019t changed. Since subsidy calculations are already available on the site, anyone who checks can find out if there has been a change. Doing so is not a requirement for renewal, i.e. people won\u2019t lose subsidies if they don\u2019t do it\u2013it\u2019s just a suggestion for now.\n\nBut there is one extra safeguard for those buying at Covered CA. After renewal, the customer will be sent a statement which says how much subsidy they are eligible for going forward. If there has been a shift in the amount of subsidy, the consumer would at least find out about it fairly quickly. Better that than not finding out until the end of the year, when the IRS does a reconciliation.\n\nCovered California is looking to streamline the process, and auto-renewal makes things simple. Do almost nothing (except approving the income verification), and you\u2019ll keep the same plan you had last year. But based on my conversation with Covered CA, the Times may have overstated the degree to which they want this to be a process one can glide through without much thought.\n\nCovered CA is taking a few steps that should help consumers be aware their subsidies could change even if their income has not. The plan as it stands now may not work for every consumer, but things could change as the letters and messages haven\u2019t been finalized yet.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Covered California Hopes to Streamline Obamacare Auto-Renewal--but Not Too Much", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Covered California Hopes to Streamline Obamacare Auto-Renewal--but Not Too Much", "title": "Covered California Hopes to Streamline Obamacare Auto-Renewal-but Not Too Much - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Breitbart-California/2014/California/Covered%20California/Covered-California.png", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/california/2014/09/05/covered-california-hopes-to-streamline-obamacare-auto-renewal-but-not-too-much/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Covered California Hopes to Streamline Obamacare Auto-Renewal--but Not Too Much", "creator": "@verumserum", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Breitbart-California/2014/California/Covered%20California/Covered-California.png", "title": "Covered California Hopes to Streamline Obamacare Auto-Renewal-but Not Too Much - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": ",Breitbart California,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Breitbart California", "published_time": "2014-09-05T03:20:32-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart California"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcad4f\"", "article_summary": "\u201cHealth plans are working with Covered California to streamline renewals,\u201d the President of an industry trade group told the Times.\nBut in light of foreseeable tax problems associated with auto-renewal, Covered California also hopes to keep consumers informed.\nAccording to a spokesperson for Covered California, the state is trying to walk a line between making it easy and also keeping people fully informed.\nCovered California is looking to streamline the process, and auto-renewal makes things simple.\nBut there is one extra safeguard for those buying at Covered CA."}
