Lee, News, Politics News\n\nThrough the cool evening mist of Tuesday, April 11, 1865, darkness gave way to light. The White House was \u201cbrilliantly illuminated\u201d and the reflection revealed a \u201cvast throng\u201d assembled to hear the president speak. Throughout the city bonfires blazed and celebratory rockets whistled.\n\nCrowds had gathered outside the White House the previous day, expecting a triumphal speech in the aftermath of Robert E. Lee\u2019s surrender to Ulysses S. Grant at Appomattox on April 9. A procession of some two thousand Navy Yard workmen, dragging six boat howitzers, trekked through the city. The gathering had swelled on its march to call on the president. Bands played and people sang the \u201cStar-Spangled Banner,\u201d \u201cHail Columbia,\u201d and other patriotic tunes. First to be sighted at the mansion\u2019s second-floor window was not the president, but his twelve-year-old son. Tad couldn\u2019t resist the parade and, encouraged by the crowd\u2019s cheers, he waved a captured rebel flag. Quickly, according to one reporter, \u201che was lugged back by the slack of his trousers by some discreet domestic.\u201d\n\nAbraham Lincoln had appeared twice on the 10th. In the early afternoon \u201can agitated sea of hats, faces and men\u2019s arms\u201d greeted him. \u201cI am greatly rejoiced that an occasion has occurred so pleasurable that the people can\u2019t restrain themselves,\u201d he said, to boisterous cheers. \u201cI suppose arrangements are being made for some sort of formal demonstration, perhaps this evening or to-morrow night.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t wait!\u201d the crowd roared.\n\n\u201cIf there should be such a demonstration, I, of course, will have to respond to it and I will have nothing to say if you dribble it out of me.\u201d\n\nMany in the throng laughed and someone shouted, \u201cWe want to hear you now!\u201d\n\nLincoln used the occasion to ask the band that had assembled to play a song. His choice was \u201cDixie,\u201d and he joked that the Union would reappropriate it as a captured prize of war. Some listeners may have wondered whether, in selecting the song (\u201cone of the best tunes I ever heard,\u201d he announced), he was signaling eventual reconciliation with rather than mocking the defeated Confederacy. In any case the band played \u201cDixie\u201d with \u201cextraordinary vigor.\u201d \u201cThe President understands well the power of national songs,\u201d observed the Daily National Intelligencer, \u201cand what is better, he uses it in the right time and for a good purpose.\u201d Lincoln proposed three cheers for General Grant and his forces, and three more for the navy, and retired from the scene to work on his remarks for the following day.\n\nAt 5:30, again on the 10th, another crowd called on Lincoln to speak, but again the president demurred, saying that he planned to wait until the following evening, when he \u201cwould be then that much better prepared to say what I have to say.\u201d After all, he observed, everything he said found its way into print and he did not want to make a mistake that would create confusion.\n\n\u201cYou have made no mistakes yet!\u201d someone shouted. One reporter thought Lincoln\u2019s remarks as \u201cunresolvable as the riddle of Sphinx . . . so carefully did he restrain from any opinion.\u201d\n\nThe next day, people were waiting \u201canxiously for the speech which the President has promised to make.\u201d The afternoon edition of the April 11 Daily National Republican announced that the event was planned for eight o\u2019clock. The notice presumed that bands again would be present. \u201cBut the music most desired by the nation at this hour of the country\u2019s trial,\u201d noted the writer, \u201cis a speech from the president. If he speaks tonight he will speak to the people of the whole country who are anxiously listening to hear something from him.\u201d\n\nAs darkness fell, lights illuminated the city. At the War Department, every window was \u201cablaze with light\u201d and the building decorated with large flags. A transparency with the word \u201cGrant\u201d flapped beneath a wreath of evergreens. The Treasury Department featured a sign that read, \u201cU.S. Greenbacks and U. S. Grant\u2014Grant gives the greenbacks a metallic ring.\u201d The State Department, \u201cbrilliantly lighted and festooned with flags,\u201d displayed a banner that read, \u201cthe Union saved by faith in the Constitution, faith in the people, and trust in God.\u201d\n\nThe north portico of the White House was also brightly lit. Men and women gathered and stood in ankle-deep mud from the April rains. They not only filled the grounds in front of the White House but spilled over onto the sidewalks from Fifteenth to Seventeeth Streets. Banners streamed and bands played. At last Lincoln appeared and was greeted with \u201ctremendous and continued applause.\u201d Mrs. Lincoln and some friends could be seen in an adjoining window. Noah Brooks, the Washington correspondent for the Sacramento Daily Union, observed later that \u201cthere was something terrible about the enthusiasm with which the beloved Chief Magistrate was received\u2014cheers upon cheers, wave after wave of applause rolled up, the President modestly standing quiet until it was over.\u201d Writing several years afterward, Elizabeth Keckley, Mary Todd Lincoln\u2019s black seamstress, recalled a vast mass of heads like \u201ca black, gently swelling sea. . . . Close to the house the faces were plainly discernible, but they faded into mere ghostly outlines on the outskirts of the assembly; and what added to the weird, spectral beauty of the scene, was the confused hum of voices that rose above the sea of forms.\u201d Lincoln chose to read from a prepared manuscript, \u201cevidently so that there should be no chance for misconception of his views enunciated,\u201d thought one reporter.\n\n\u201cWe meet this evening, not in sorrow, but in gladness of heart,\u201d he began. Petersburg and Richmond had been evacuated. Only a week earlier, the president had walked through the streets of Richmond and had sat in Jefferson Davis\u2019s chair at the Confederate White House. Lee\u2019s army had surrendered. \u201cHope of a righteous and speedy peace\u201d now abounded.\n\nThe word \u201crighteous\u201d invites attention. It was not a word Lincoln employed frequently, but its appearance here echoed earlier usage. In the speech that helped make him a candidate for president, Lincoln told the crowd at Cooper Union on February 27, 1860, that those who seek to preserve the Union by yielding to those who were clamoring for disunion reverse the divine order of things and call \u201cnot the sinners, but the righteous to repentance.\u201d He repeated the formulation several times in his speaking tour through New England that followed.\n\nThe cause of Union was the righteous cause; the next time he would use the word in his writings, it was for the cause of emancipation, also deemed \u201crighteous.\u201d In response to a letter from two Iowa Quakers commending him for issuing the Emancipation Proclamation on January 1, 1863, Lincoln wrote, \u201cit is most cheering and encouraging for me to know that in the efforts which I have made and am making for the restoration of a righteous peace to our country, I am upheld and sustained by the good wishes and prayers of God\u2019s people.\u201d\n\nThe religious overtones of the righteous cause, and by extension all measures necessary for victory, were made clear in Lincoln\u2019s second inaugural address on March 4, when he quoted Psalms 19:9, \u201c\u2018the judgments of the Lord, are true and righteous altogether.\u2019\u201d Following that line, Lincoln memorably concluded with a sentence calling for \u201ca just, and a lasting peace.\u201d Perhaps he did not say \u201crighteous\u201d because he had used it in quoting Psalms. More likely, in keeping with the overall content of a soaring conclusion that begins \u201cwith malice toward none, with charity for all,\u201d Lincoln wanted to signal fairness and even-handedness. On March 4, the war still was not over; on April 11, it essentially was.\n\nLincoln not only sought justice, he also desired mercy. His generosity and magnanimity would come to distress his party\u2019s radicals, though he never wavered from what he declared in his second inaugural: \u201cjudge not that we be not judged.\u201d Indeed, he repeated the injunction several times in April 1865. There would be occasion to debate how best to unify the nation, but Lincoln began that speech on April 11 by reasserting the righteousness of the Union cause and calling for a day of national Thanksgiving. \u201cHe, from Whom all blessings flow, must not be forgotten,\u201d he said.\n\nLincoln then turned to the subject of his speech: reconstruction. This word, too, is not without its ambiguities. It is common to contrast \u201creconstruction\u201d with \u201crestoration,\u201d and to suggest that the former entailed a more or less radical remaking of southern society whereas the latter simply meant returning the states to full political membership in the nation. Some Democratic newspapers in 1865 were careful to distinguish between the two words. Some historians argue that Lincoln\u2019s ideas shifted from \u201crestoration\u201d to \u201creconstruction,\u201d but the president\u2019s uses of the words suggest something different. He told the crowd on that misty night, \u201cthe re-inauguration of the national authority\u2014reconstruction\u2014which has had a large share of thought from the first, is pressed much more closely upon our attention.\u201d Here, Lincoln defines \u201creconstruction\u201d simply: the states submitting to federal authority and returning to the nation.\n\nWhen Lincoln used \u201crestoration,\u201d he tended to do so in the context of the return of peace or, as he put it in 1862, \u201cthe speedy restoration of our Union.\u201d But the terms were fluid. Either \u201crestoration\u201d or \u201creconstruction\u201d could signify simultaneously the process of establishing civil government in the states themselves and the process of the states returning to the nation. Lincoln himself acknowledged the fluidity and imprecision of the nomenclature when, in his Annual Message to Congress in 1863, he spoke of \u201cmaintaining the political framework of the States on what is called Reconstruction.\u201d Nearly three months earlier, in a letter to Andrew Johnson, then still the military governor of Tennessee, he declared, \u201clet the reconstruction be the work only of such men as can be trusted for the Union.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Exactly 150 years ago, two days after Robert E.
