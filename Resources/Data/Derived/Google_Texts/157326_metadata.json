In November, crossover vehicles accounted or 40 percent of U.S. auto sales and is the fastest-growing segment of the auto industry.\n\nThe four-door, five-passenger compact Envision will fit in the Buick crossover lineup below the Enclave and above the Encore.\n\nThe Envision-from-China announcement comes two weeks after GM's U.S. unionized plant workers ratified a new labor contract, but a GM spokesman said the company did not hold off on announcement of the China import because of negotiations with the United Auto Workers.\n\nNext summer's sale of the Envision was reported earlier on Friday by the Automotive News.\n\nWhile the Envision is built at a plant in Yantai in China, a GM statement issued on Friday emphasized that it was \"designed, engineered and tested in Michigan.\"\n\nThrough November, GM reported sales of 127,085 Envision in China.\n\nTogether, U.S. sales of the Encore and Enclave through November were up 16 percent at 117,200 from a year earlier. Sales of Buick's three sedans through November fell 21 percent from a year earlier.\n\n(Reporting by Bernie Woodall; editing by Sandra Maler and Nick Zieminski)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/12/04/First-GM-China-made-import-US-go-sale-mid-2016-GM", "type": "article", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/autos-gm_1.jpg", "site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "title": "GM to Start Importing Buicks from China to the US"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/12/04/First-GM-China-made-import-US-go-sale-mid-2016-GM", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/autos-gm_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "In November, crossover vehicles accounted or 40 percent of U.S. auto sales and is the fastest-growing segment of the auto industry.\nThrough November, GM reported sales of 127,085 Envision in China.\nThe four-door, five-passenger compact Envision will fit in the Buick crossover lineup below the Enclave and above the Encore.\nThe Envision will give Buick three \"crossover\u201d vehicles in the U.S. market.\nNext summer's sale of the Envision was reported earlier on Friday by the Automotive News."}
