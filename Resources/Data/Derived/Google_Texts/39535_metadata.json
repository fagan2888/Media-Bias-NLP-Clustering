Why would someone else offer more poison ostensibly to help this same patient? Anyone refers to Congress; someone else is author Steven Brill; and the patient is named \u2026 Healthcare.\n\nHealthcare is a Patient\n\nA system can be just as ill as the sickest human. Patient Healthcare is critical. This is a direct result of malpractice, a failure to use the four principles of good medical practice:\n\nTreat causes, not symptoms. Make evidence-based recommendations. Offer long-term, quantified cost/benefit analysis to patient. Create a partnership; a good doctor never forces treatment on a patient.\n\nMalpractice is Occurring on Patient Healthcare\n\nCongress ignored all four of these principles. Congress chose to ignore the cause of patient Healthcare\u2019s woes \u2013 a cancer, located in the federal bureaucracy.\n\nA good doctor \u2013 principle No. 2 \u2013 would never say, \u201cI do not know what it is in this medicine. I have no proof that it works. Take it anyway. Trust me!\u201d That is precisely what Congress said about the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare.\n\nThe standard of care requires a doctor to offer evidence-of-effect. Failure to do this constitutes prima facie evidence of malpractice. What does that say about Congress\u2019 failure to demonstrate evidence-of-effect before passing laws such as Medicare, Medicaid, Emergency Medical Treatment & Labor Act, Health Insurance Accountability and Portability Act, Unfunded Mandate Reform Act, and Obamacare?\n\nPrinciple No. 3 above involves an obligation to do the value calculation. Consumers do that multiple times every day. Is there one shred of hard evidence that proves We The Patients will benefit from Obamacare? Congress has never shown us any evidence at all, simply exclaiming, \u201cTrust me!\u201d\n\nThe worst form of malpractice is Washington\u2019s dismissal of principle No. 4. No doctor would ever, ever force medicine down a patient\u2019s throat against his or her will. That is called assault and battery. If a surgeon operates without consent, that is attempted murder.\n\nEvery survey of the American people conducted since March 23, 2010 shows that a majority opposes Obamacare. We don\u2019t want the medicine, yet we are forced to take it.\n\nCongress is guilty of four counts of medical malpractice on patient Healthcare.\n\nTime\u2019s Malpractice on Patient Healthcare\n\nNow Time magazine and lawyer-author-patient Steven Brill joins Congress in practicing bad medicine. Their cover story of Jan. 19, 2015 is titled, \u201cWhat I Learned From My $190,000 Heart Surgery.\u201d Apparently, what Brill learned was how to pile on, as they say in football.\n\nOne of Healthcare\u2019s biggest problems is the regulatory burden. It\u2019s like those commercials with an elephant sitting on a man\u2019s chest. How can he, or poor Healthcare, breathe?\n\nUseless bureaucratic mandates, built-in inefficiency, incomprehensible as well as contradictory rules and regulations are driving many (like me) out of clinical medicine while they simultaneously raise costs to individuals and the nation.\n\nWashington never analyzes the cost/benefit. When I tried to calculate the cost of the federal regulatory burden on U.S. taxpayers, there was no hard data. So, I simply added up all the costs that provided any form of care to patients, from doctors and nurses to wheelchair manufacturers and pharmaceutical companies. (I did not include insurance companies, Obamacare oversight compliance officers, or IRS agents.)\n\nHealth CARE accounted for roughly 60 percent of all the money consumed by the healthcare system. Therefore, 40 percent or $1 trillion went to healthcare bureaucracy! And they take the first, biggest bite. We get what is left over.\n\nImagine how much health CARE doctors could give We The Patients for $1 trillion!\n\nWe have a wildly over-expensive, wasteful system burdened by an incomprehensible and imassive (10,516 pages in the Federal Register just for Obamacare) set of rules and regulations. What does Time author Steven Brill recommend? More regulations!\n\nIn his lengthy Time article, Mr. Brill offers seven new regulations:\n\nMandate medical oligarchies\n\nControl profits\n\nControl salaries\n\nMandate an appeals process\n\nRequire that medical CEOs be practicing MDs\n\nRequire coverage for Medicaid patients\n\nControl prices for the uninsured\n\nNote the verbs: mandate, control, control, mandate, require, require, and control. Healthcare\u2019s biggest problems are over-regulation, excessive central control, and inherent bureaucratic inefficiency. So author Brill wants to expand bureaucracy, increase central control, and magnify the waste of healthcare dollars!\n\nTime Editor Nancy Gibbs joined Mr. Brill advocating increased government control asking, \u201cWhat would it really take to control costs?\u201d Controls are centrally implemented, meaning medical rationing. Is that what the American people want?\n\nIn preparation for The Cancer in Healthcare, we performed several surveys. There was only one item on which 100 percent agreed. Regardless of age, gender, economic status or political persuasion, everyone wanted more \u201ccontrol of my health care.\u201d\n\nIf you accept entitlements such as government-subsidized health insurance, you reject your control. Yielding control to the government, you get less care and fewer dollars in your wallet as Obamacare is proving right now.\n\nPracticing Good Medicine on Patient Healthcare\n\nPatient Healthcare needs an old-fashioned country doctor. He would discover that Patient Healthcare has cancer \u2013 cancer of the bureaucracy. And, Healthcare\u2019s treating physicians \u2013 federal bureaucrats \u2013 are actively suppressing this diagnosis. They are agents of the cancer.\n\nWe need to start with principle No. 1 of good medical practice: treat the cause not the symptoms. If over-control is the cause, the cure is to reduce the level of control. Give control back to the people.\n\nLet individual Americans choose how to spend healthcare dollars. After all, it IS their money as well as their lives. You will no doubt hear someone shout, \u201cI can\u2019t possibly afford to pay for my health care.\u201d The answer is one hard fact, one reasonable prediction, and no empty promises.\n\nHard fact: According to a Deloitte study, the U.S. spent $3.46 trillion on healthcare in 2012. This means every man, woman, child, and baby spent $11,089 on healthcare even those who never saw a doctor, took a pill, or visited an Emergency Room.\n\nReasonable prediction: If patients had control of their own spending; if sellers\u2013hospitals, doctors, suppliers\u2013were forced to compete for those dollars; and if the federal bureaucracy were essentially cut out of the equation, the prices for everything in healthcare would plummet into the affordable range.\n\nEmpty promises: none. That is for the people in Congress. Good doctors don\u2019t do that.\n\n\u201cDr. Deane\u201d Waldman MD MBA is author of award-winning \u201cThe Cancer in Healthcare;\u201d host of the Newsletter-&-Forum, We The Patients; Professor Emeritus of Pediatrics, Pathology, and Decision Science; Adjunct Scholar (Healthcare) for Rio Grande Foundation public policy think tank; Former Chief of Cardiology (Pediatric) at University of Chicago; and currently serves as \u201cConsumer Advocate\u201d member of the Board of Directors of the New Mexico Health Insurance Exchange.
