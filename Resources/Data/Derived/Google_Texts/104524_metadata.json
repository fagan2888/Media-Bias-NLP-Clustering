That\u2019s all I can say.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t-ask, don\u2019t-tell characterizes Colorado\u2019s newest cash crop. Like its genetic cousin marijuana, hemp is legal under state law. But conflicts with federal law leave the future uncertain for the state\u2019s hemp industry.\n\nThe plant looks like marijuana but has little or no THC, the psychoactive ingredient that makes pot smokers high.\n\nThe federal government\u2019s prohibition on hemp was partially eased in the Farm Bill passed by Congress this year. Still, Colorado growers have no legal means to buy starter seed from out of state, nor to sell their harvested raw seed outside of Colorado.\n\nSome growers are using Colorado\u2019s hemp laws to cultivate ultra-low-THC cannabis for use in medical marijuana extracts, only adding to the confusion.\n\nLegal hurdles aside, advocates are passionate about hemp\u2019s commercial potential. The most common uses are food products and cosmetics derived from seeds and seed oil. Fiber from the stalks of hemp plants are used in clothing and industrial applications, including as a strengthening agent in concrete.\n\n2014 marked the first year of state-authorized hemp cultivation in Colorado. About 30 growers filed applications to plant a total of 1,811 acres. But because state law does not yet require detailed reporting, no statistics exist on how much actually was planted and subsequently harvested.\n\nSeveral farmers are planning to save seed from this year\u2019s harvest to sow the 2015 crop.\n\nOn a former alfalfa field near Sterling, Billings, his daughter Danielle and business partner Jim Brammer planted 2 acres of hemp. Their harvest brought in nearly a ton of seed and flowers.\n\n\u201cIt came up just amazing,\u201d Billings said. \u201cWe irrigated three times, compared to six or seven times for (nearby) corn crops.\u201d\n\nBillings said he\u2019s planning to make his own lines of hemp oils, lotions and mints, and he\u2019s talking with retailers including Walmart and Whole Foods to carry the products.\n\nBut the same federal legal constraints that make it hard to buy seed also inhibit the creation of a large-scale Colorado hemp industry with interstate trade. Like marijuana entrepreneurs, hemp growers have limited or no access to banking services, said Lynda Parker, vice president of the Rocky Mountain Hemp Association.\n\n\u201cTo have a real industry with manufacturing and processing of hemp products, you can\u2019t do that unless there\u2019s a steady market for hemp,\u201d Parker said. \u201cAnd that can\u2019t happen until we can access the banking system.\u201d\n\nSteve Raabe: 303-954-1948, sraabe@denverpost.com or twitter.com/steveraabedp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Colorado\u2019s first legal hemp crop comes in amid constraints by fed laws", "title": "Colorado\u2019s first legal hemp crop comes in amid constraints by fed laws", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/12/19/colorados-first-legal-hemp-crop-comes-in-amid-constraints-by-fed-laws/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141219__20141228_W15_CD28MMJhempp2.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141219__20141228_W15_CD28MMJhempp2.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-19T19:59:52+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T06:22:07+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Marijuana Colorado, Marijuana Year In Pot"}, "article_summary": "Like its genetic cousin marijuana, hemp is legal under state law.\nLike marijuana entrepreneurs, hemp growers have limited or no access to banking services, said Lynda Parker, vice president of the Rocky Mountain Hemp Association.\nBut because state law does not yet require detailed reporting, no statistics exist on how much actually was planted and subsequently harvested.\nBut the same federal legal constraints that make it hard to buy seed also inhibit the creation of a large-scale Colorado hemp industry with interstate trade.\nBut conflicts with federal law leave the future uncertain for the state\u2019s hemp industry."}
