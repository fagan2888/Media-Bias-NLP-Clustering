Harris knows all about tradition. Since 1999, save one year, the Bellevue resident and retired Air Force colonel has come to the shelter on Thanksgiving and Christmas to help serve.\n\n\u201cIt's very festive, and the part I find most exciting is when the children come in with their presents,\u201d Harris said. \u201cEven though they may only have one or two, they're grateful for that. It brings me and some of the others down to earth.\u201d\n\nThat humility has kept Harris coming back to the shelter every holiday.\n\n\u201cIt just lets us know we're just a stone's throw away from being here if times get tough,\u201d he said.\n\nKitchen manager Harold Patsios and assistant manager Guy Jones started breakfast about 5:30 a.m. Patsios, who came to the shelter years ago for help with his alcohol addiction, estimated that they'd serve meals to at least 400 homeless men, women and children.\n\n\u201cI enjoy coming down,\u201d he said. \u201cEverybody seems to be in a better mood than usual, even with all the stresses of being homeless.\u201d\n\nSmall gestures \u2014 a hot meal, the gift of a clean shirt \u2014 can mean the world to someone struggling with addiction or homelessness, he said.\n\n\u201cPeople sometimes get depressed this time of year, and we try to do whatever we can to help them through that,\u201d he said. \u201cIt's important. A kind word, a pat on the back, someone saying you're important \u2014 if I can give that back to the community, then that's worthwhile.\u201d\n\nJones and his fellow staffers were gearing up for a long day, between the breakfast crowd and the hundreds more that would turn up for the traditional Korean dinner.\n\n\u201cBut it's good to give back,\u201d said Jones, a resident at the shelter. \u201cThis place saved my life.\u201d\n\nWhile the weather was milder on Wednesday, December's blisteringly cold weather has left many of Omaha's homeless shelters over capacity in recent weeks. Siena-Francis House has 389 beds but has been sleeping close to 500.\n\n\u201cToday, it's kind of relaxing and laid back,\u201d Jones said. \u201cA lot of these guys are happy to not be out in the cold.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Omaha.com", "description": "Hundreds of homeless men and women lined up for a special Christmas brunch at the Siena-Francis House homeless shelter Wednesday morning, where they dined with friends or spent a quiet morning in reflection.", "title": "Christmas brunch at homeless shelter is about more than just the food", "url": "http://www.omaha.com/news/christmas-brunch-at-homeless-shelter-is-about-more-than-just/article_fe732116-8653-51cb-b79c-fe38453e96bd.html", "image": {"width": 760, "identifier": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/omaha.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/d/08/d082bb43-9fc1-5ab5-a931-1b88acd4ae9d/5332ed5a74ba5.image.jpg?resize=760%2C533", "height": 533}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@OWHnews", "card": "summary"}, "description": "Hundreds of homeless men and women lined up for a special Christmas brunch at the Siena-Francis House homeless shelter Wednesday morning, where they dined with friends or spent a quiet morning in reflection.", "fb": {"app_id": 117714391577072}, "keywords": "news", "google-site-verification": "gE-kSjgMAF16OyUU3QCB0Ap0PQnFlh5oPdueJO6D2cQ", "news_keywords": "news"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe18f3\"", "article_summary": "Hundreds of homeless men and women lined up for a special Christmas brunch at the Siena-Francis House homeless shelter Wednesday morning, where they dined with friends or spent a quiet morning in reflection.\nSince 1999, save one year, the Bellevue resident and retired Air Force colonel has come to the shelter on Thanksgiving and Christmas to help serve.\nVolunteers and shelter staff dished out mounds of food \u2014 scrambled eggs, sausage links, doughnuts, French toast sticks and hash browns \u2014 and kept the coffee and juice flowing.\nIt brings me and some of the others down to earth.\u201dThat humility has kept Harris coming back to the shelter every holiday.\n\u201cBut it's good to give back,\u201d said Jones, a resident at the shelter."}
