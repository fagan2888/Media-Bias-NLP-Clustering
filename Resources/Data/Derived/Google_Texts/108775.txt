When the American people look back on Thursday’s GOP presidential debate in South Carolina, it ought to be marked as the day when real issues began to matter. Call it Before Charleston and After Charleston.

Before Charleston, there has been too much unproductive rhetoric and hyperbole that fed the one-hour news cycle but added little substantive debate. To his credit, Ohio Gov. John Kasich has continued to run an issues-centric campaign, and more of the same would be welcome from all of the candidates.

After Charleston can mark the beginning of mature, thoughtful discourse that will frame the conversation moving forward. After Charleston sounds more like South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley’s message of accountability and hope in the Republican response to President Obama’s State of the Union Address on Tuesday night.

“We need to be honest with each other, and with ourselves: While Democrats in Washington bear much responsibility for the problems facing America today, they do not bear it alone,” she said. “There is more than enough blame to go around.

“We as Republicans need to own that truth. We need to recognize our contributions to the erosion of the public trust in America’s leadership. We need to accept that we've played a role in how and why our government is broken. And then we need to fix it.”

Thursday night’s main debate in North Charleston, S.C., will feature seven candidates who are polling in the top five in Iowa and New Hampshire: former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, Dr. Ben Carson, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, Kasich, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and developer Donald Trump.

With the Iowa Caucuses three weeks away, here are five key issues the candidates ought to address with more substance Thursday:

Health care: Put forth the building blocks of a plan that would improve the Affordable Care Act passed in 2010. So far, much of the rhetoric has pointed out the failings of Obamacare, but frontrunners have not articulated a substantive alternative.

Jobs: While the American economy continues to create jobs – largely in education, health care and hospitality – candidates should outline plans that will drive more growth in desirable jobs and innovation.

Education: The Obama administration brought a competitive, market-driven approach to improving school performance, including supporting charter schools. And most states adopted Common Core, a set of clear college- and career-ready standards for kindergarten through 12th grade in English and math. Voters are eager to hear how Republican candidates will lead on an education agenda that can include early childhood education and a renewed focus on science, technology, engineering and math.

Crime and social justice: This is historically a progressive issue, but Republican candidates should not ignore the impact of high-profile police-community conflicts across the country. It has been an issue in Cincinnati, and it has been an issue in North Charleston, where a former police officer was charged with murder in the shooting death of an unarmed man. Similarly, Republicans can take the opportunity to go beyond pro-Second Amendment talking points and address responsible gun ownership.

Foreign policy: Thursday’s debate comes days after Iran detained and freed 10 American sailors whose ship strayed into Iranian waters. Deadly attacks in California and Paris have continued to place the focus on how to deal with the rise of Islamic extremists, with some GOP candidates offering xenophobic and unhelpful comments rather than a new vision for American foreign policy.

What voters need to hear Thursday night are detailed but plain-spoken arguments –the kind that can resonate around the kitchen table – and reset the campaign in a productive way.

Kasich on key issues

Ohio Gov. John Kasich has done a better job than most of the GOP candidates on sticking to the issues and staking out thoughtful positions. Here he is, mostly courtesy of the Des Moines Register, on:

Jobs: Promises to create an environment to spur job growth, which would include tax cuts, decreased government regulation, increased energy production, and sending some federal programs back to states and local governments. He also supports programs to help what he describes as the most vulnerable Americans.

Education: Supports Common Core.

Health care: Opposed to the Affordable Care Act and wants to repeal it. However, he has supported an expansion of Medicaid, a state-federal health insurance program for low-income and disabled people, saying it's a separate issue.

Immigration: Rejects the idea that undocumented immigrants should be deported. He believes border security should be strengthened, and undocumented immigrants should be identified and required to register.

Foreign policy: Says the United States has wavered in its resolve under President Obama, leaving a vacuum for extremism to spread. The United States must rebuild its military strength and return to its historical role as a global leader in conjunction with allies who share our values, he says.
