But now, as the 47-year-old farmer prepares to fight for his land, Ruiz insists, \u201cI\u2019m not going to run.\u201d\n\nRuiz\u2019s property on the banks of Nicaragua\u2019s Rio Grande sits in the path of a $50 billion transoceanic waterway set to break ground on Monday.\n\nNicaraguan officials will start building access roads on state-owned land as the first step in creating a canal expected to rival that of Panama \u2014 a project supporters say will directly employ 50,000 people and dramatically boost the country\u2019s GDP.\n\nFarmers like Ruiz insist they\u2019ll fight \u201cuntil the last breath\u201d to protect their land. Whether or not landowners do actually take up arms, Nicaragua\u2019s government insists it is determined to push through.\n\nThe project is slated to open a huge waterway over what is now the town of Rio Grande, an evangelical-dominated community of 2,000 people with only a dirt road amid fields of corn, beans, banana and sorghum. Everything within 10 kilometers (6 miles) would be subject to expropriation.\n\nBut the project, which opponents call President Daniel Ortega\u2019s pipe dream, is provoking growing anger.\n\nMany complain Ortega is giving too much away to HKND, the Hong Kong-based company set to develop and operate it. Landowners fear they\u2019ll be displaced without fair compensation. Environmentalists accuse the government of ram-rodding past mandated reviews and ignoring the threat that cargo traffic will pose to Lake Nicaragua, the country\u2019s main source of fresh water.\n\nEarlier this month, residents of Obrajuelo, a sleepy fishing village on the banks of Lake Nicaragua, threw stones at an SUV carrying a Chinese team that showed up to survey the land. The following day, they burned tires on the Pan-American highway, blocking it for hours. On Dec. 10, as many as 5,000 people marched through the capital, Managua. Even though protesters complained that police blocked canal-opponents trying to arrive from the countryside, observers said it was the largest anti-government action in years.\n\nSuch political opposition is virtually unheard of in a country where Ortega\u2019s Sandinista party dominates all branches of government, and the president and his wife, the government\u2019s powerful communications chief, keep a tight lid on dissent.\n\n\u201cWhat it shows is that a significant part of the Nicaraguan people have not bought into the canal project,\u201d said Francisco Aguirre-Sacasa, an economist, former Nicaraguan foreign minister and ex-ambassador to the United States. \u201cA demonstration of that size, despite the impediments that were put in the way of it, shows that the government is playing with fire in this case.\u201d\n\nProjected to span some 173 miles (278 kilometers) between the Caribbean and the Pacific, the canal would be the realization of a dream that has been studied and discarded multiple times since the early 1800s. Backers say it would lift many out of poverty in the Western Hemisphere\u2019s second-poorest country.\n\nLast year, Ortega\u2019s allies in Congress fast-tracked legislation granting HKND a 50-year concession, renewable for another 50, to build and operate a canal in return for a payment of $10 million a year once it\u2019s up and running. The law lets HKND develop ancillary projects \u2014 ports, an airport, roads, a railway \u2014 even if it doesn\u2019t get built.\n\nHKND hired the respected U.K.-based consulting firm Environmental Resources Management about a year ago to assess the environmental and social impact of a project that is expected to displace some 29,000 people. In late July, just two weeks after HKND announced its preferred route for the canal, ERM held community meetings in seven cities over 10 days, according to a document on HKND\u2019s website.\n\nSome who attended the sessions left feeling they were merely being told what was going to happen rather than asked for input. Those who asked how much they would be paid for their lands were told only that officials would go door-to-door to inform them.\n\n\u201cIt was so they could say, \u2018We did the meetings,\u2019 \u201d said Rosa Amelia Mora Novoa, a 37-year-old homemaker in Rio Grande who attended the session in Rivas, capital of the department of the same name.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Rising anger as Nicaragua canal to break ground", "title": "Rising anger as Nicaragua canal to break ground", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Rising anger as Nicaragua canal to break ground", "title": "Rising anger as Nicaragua canal to break ground", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/12/21/rising_anger_as_nicaragua_canal_to_break_ground/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/12/nicaragua-canal-fight.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Rising anger as Nicaragua canal to break ground", "title": "Rising anger as Nicaragua canal to break ground", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/12/nicaragua-canal-fight.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Peter Orsi", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWhat it shows is that a significant part of the Nicaraguan people have not bought into the canal project,\u201d said Francisco Aguirre-Sacasa, an economist, former Nicaraguan foreign minister and ex-ambassador to the United States.\nBut now, as the 47-year-old farmer prepares to fight for his land, Ruiz insists, \u201cI\u2019m not going to run.\u201dRuiz\u2019s property on the banks of Nicaragua\u2019s Rio Grande sits in the path of a $50 billion transoceanic waterway set to break ground on Monday.\nTopics: From the Wires, NewsRIO GRANDE, Nicaragua (AP) \u2014 As a conscripted soldier during the Contra War of the 1980s, Esteban Ruiz used to flee from battles because he didn\u2019t want to have to kill anyone.\nBut the project, which opponents call President Daniel Ortega\u2019s pipe dream, is provoking growing anger.\nMany complain Ortega is giving too much away to HKND, the Hong Kong-based company set to develop and operate it."}
