Click here for our weekly roundup of national blogs.\n\nNortheast\n\nOn Wednesday this week, Maine\u2019s Pine Tree Politics looks at whether or not families in the state who are given state assistance are rescued from poverty. They say that welfare proposals from the state\u2019s Governor, Paul LePage recognize that state assistance can lead to cycles of dependency, and actually aim to create true safety nets which will redirect people into work.\n\nMoving down to Massachusetts, Blue Mass Group writes Tuesday that the conservative wing of the state\u2019s GOP are not going down without a fight. They write that a conservative group is lobbying against the state\u2019s transgender accommodation bill, which would put in place non-discrimination protections for the transgendered in public places. They comment that given that the state\u2019s Republican Governor, Charlie Baker, has been trying to remake the state\u2019s Republican Party, he is more likely to sign than veto the bill.\n\nContinuing on to Rhode Island, it looks like the people of the Ocean State might be too much for Donald Trump; Trump has stated he won\u2019t be visiting there because of his fears about \u2018disruptive protestors\u2019.\n\nMeanwhile, in the Empire State, Governor Andrew Cuomo this week vetoed 210 line items in the state\u2019s budget, reports State of Politics. Measures given the thumbs-down by Cuomo included 14 on constitutional grounds.\n\nPolitickerNJ looks at New Jersey Lieutenant Governor Kim Guadagno\u2019s chances of taking over from Governor Chris Christie in at the 2017 election. They comment that given her links with Christie, Guadagno may be facing an uphill battle.\n\nIn the Keystone State this week, Raging Chicken Press wonders if the state House Bill to ban abortions at 20 weeks is now dead. They say that the bill is now not likely to come up for a vote in the state House as the legislature is now focusing on getting a budget passed.\n\nSouth\n\nBearingDrift this week reports on Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe\u2019s attempts to avoid the use of the electric chair in executions in cases where the relevant drugs are not available by allowing secrecy over who provides the cocktail of drugs used in executions. They say that the move is a strike against transparency, and that McAuliffe should know better.\n\nHeading on to Kentucky, Blue in the Bluegrass says that the state\u2019s \u2018austerity\u2019 budget as approved by the state House and Senate is not as bad now as Governor Matt Bevin \u2013 who has a line-item veto \u2013 will make it.\n\nNorth Carolina stayed in the news this week with continued controversy over the state\u2019s HB2 \u2013 the recently passed bill which rolls back LGBT rights protections. The Progressive Pulse reports that in response to the controversy, Governor Pat McCrory has issued an executive order which he claims will fix some of the bill\u2019s problems. They comment that McCrory\u2019s move fails to live up to the hype and actually reinforces many of the bill\u2019s most objectionable provisions.\n\nMoving west to Alabama, Yellowhammer reports that whistleblowers from inside the state\u2019s government have stated that in 2015 Governor Robert Bentley ordered a state helicopter to fly his wallet to the beach after he had forgotten it.\n\nMississippi\u2019s Y\u2019all Politics writes this week that a federal judge has stated that the Confederate emblem on the flag of the Magnolia State is \u2018anti-American\u2019, given that it represents those who fought to leave the US. The comments come during a lawsuit to decide whether the flag is an unconstitutional relic of slavery.\n\nIn other line-item-veto news, Arkansas blog wonders if the state Governor Asa Hutchinson\u2019s likely veto of a budget item which kills Obamacare in the state will be legal. Hutchinson wants to expand Medicaid in the state, but has faced gridlock in the legislature because of divisions among the state GOP.\n\nMidwest\n\nOn Monday, Plunderbund accuses Ohio Governor (and GOP presidential primary candidate) John Kasich of hypocrisy over his calls for the national GOP to be transparent during the party\u2019s July nomination convention. They say that Kasich has insulated his administration from letting the public know information from the cost of his security to releasing his own tax returns from his years at Lehman Brothers.\n\nIn a new podcast, Indy Politics discusses the Hoosier State\u2019s manufacturing myths, and the state of American industry in general.\n\nHeading on to Illinois, Capitol Fax reports that the state is likely to direct state employees to continue working, even if there is a shutdown over the state\u2019s lack of budget. They say that employees will be paid\u2026eventually. Staying in the Prairie State, Progress Illinois has the news that state Democrats have introduced a graduated state income tax plan, which would replace the state\u2019s 3.75 percent flat tax. Ninety-nine percent of Illinois tax payers would pay less under the proposals.\n\nWisconsin\u2019s Political Environment writes Monday on the growing concern over the Badger State\u2019s groundwater crisis. They write that eight counties have groundwater contamination and capacity issues mostly enabled by large agricultural interests.\n\nSay Anything, meanwhile reports on comments from North Dakota state Senator Tim Mathern, that the position of state Treasurer (which he is running for) should be eliminated. They say that the comments put the incumbent, Kelly Schmidt in the position of having to justify her own job.\n\nWest and Pacific\n\nIn Colorado this week, The Spot comments that the recent killing of a ban on gay conversion therapy by a state Senate committee is going to be an election issue. Staying in the Centennial State, Colorado Peak Politics writes that while he is now complaining about the state\u2019s GOP for not holding a primary, only one day before his tram was praising them, and was not even expecting to pick up one delegate in the state.\n\nBlog for Arizona looks at what they say is the GOP\u2019s \u2018court packing\u2019 scheme in the state.\n\nNevada\u2019s Desert Beacon profiles Sharron Angle who is campaigning once again for the state\u2019s US Senate seat and Michele Fiore, who is running for the state\u2019s 3rd Congressional District. Both are very conservative; Fiore has argued women on university campuses should be armed, while Angle wants to get rid of health coverage for maternity leave and autism.\n\nMoving on to the Golden State, Fox & Hounds looks at what they say is California\u2019s job creation and destruction machine, with 300,000 payroll jobs both created and destroyed every month.\n\nOver in Alaska, The Mudflats writes that state legislators have been pushing for more guns in schools and government buildings, rather than addressing the state\u2019s more important fiscal woes.\n\nFeatured image credit: 401(K) 2012, Flickr, CC BY SA 2.0\n\nPlease read our comments policy before commenting.\n\nNote: This article gives the views of the author, and not the position of USAPP\u2013 American Politics and Policy, nor of the London School of Economics.\n\nShortened URL for this post: http://bit.ly/1qzRSHO", "article_metadata": {"description": "USAPP Managing Editor,\u00a0Chris Gilson, looks at the week in US state blogging.\u00a0Click here for our weekly roundup of national blogs.
