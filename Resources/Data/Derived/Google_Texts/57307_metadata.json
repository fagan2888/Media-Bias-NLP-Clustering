According to last week\u2019s CBS News/New York Times poll, 57 percent of Americans think \u201cthe government [should] do more to reduce the gap between the rich and the poor.\u2019\u201d Even Republicans are losing faith in the free market: Fifty-three percent of them say only \u201ca few people at the top \u2026 have a chance to get ahead,\u201d 56 percent say the wealth gap is increasing, 47 percent say it\u2019s \u201ca problem that needs to be addressed now,\u201d 62 percent say \u201clarge corporations have too much influence,\u201d and 53 percent favor \u201craising taxes on people earning more than $1 million per year.\u201d\n\nWilliam Saletan Will Saletan writes about politics, science, technology, and other stuff for Slate. He\u2019s the author of Bearing Right.\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re a Republican candidate for president, how do you deal with this grim environment? By running against business. You just have to do it in a way that Republican voters can accept. The trick is to find a trusty conservative message and turn that message into an attack on corporate America. The 2016 GOP candidates are already at work on this challenge. Here are some of the strategies they\u2019ve come up with.\n\n1. Attack big business as an ally of big government. Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry is trying out this approach. Here\u2019s what he said Thursday as he announced his candidacy:\n\nFor small businesses on Main Street, those that are struggling to just get by, that are smothered by regulation\u2014they\u2019re targeted by Dodd-Frank\u2014I hear you. You\u2019re not forgotten. Your time is coming. The American people, they see this rigged game, where the insiders get rich, the middle class pays the tab. There\u2019s something wrong when the Dow is near record highs, and businesses on Main Street can\u2019t even get a loan. Since when did capitalism involve the elimination of risk for the biggest banks while regulations strangle our community banks? Capitalism is not corporatism. It is not a guarantee of reward without risk. It\u2019s not about Wall Street at the expense of Main Street.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nPerry\u2019s audience loved this message. It\u2019s not a call for government intervention or redistribution. It\u2019s a demand that government get out of the way. It blames the rigged game on regulation, and ultimately on \u201cinsiders\u201d\u2014rich people who, instead of competing fairly in the free market, use the chains of state power to hobble the rest of us and to insulate themselves from risk. Perry\u2019s closing lines about capitalism and corporatism are perfect. He casts himself not as a revolutionary but as a traditionalist who will lead us back to a truly free market.\n\nThe Dodd-Frank restrictions on lending fit nicely into Perry\u2019s critique. So does the Affordable Care Act. In his speech, Perry pledged that when he becomes president, \u201cHealth insurers will have to earn the right to your money instead of lobbying Washington to force you to hand it over.\u201d All the Republican candidates bash Obamacare, but Perry is the only one who has figured out how to bash corporations in the same breath.\n\n2. Attack big business as a friend of immigrants. Former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum is betting on this message. Here\u2019s what he said last week as he kicked off his campaign:\n\nIn the late \u201970s, like many of you, we saw the economic devastation \u2026 across this country, particularly in the area of manufacturing, as a result of the excesses and indifference of big labor, big government, and, yes, big business. Here in southwestern Pennsylvania, the epicenter, we lost over 100,000 jobs. \u2026 Afterwards, big government and big business told our workers that times had changed, [that] American workers could no longer compete with low foreign wages, and that those jobs were gone forever. \u2026\n\nOver the last 20 years, we\u2019ve brought into this country, legally and illegally, 35 million mostly unskilled workers, and the result \u2026 [is that] workers\u2019 wages and family incomes have flat-lined. Hillary and big business, they have called for a massive influx in unskilled labor. Business does it because they want to control costs. Hillary does it [because] she just wants votes. Their priorities are profits and power. My priority is you, the American worker.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nSantorum\u2019s message adds a twist to Perry\u2019s. Big business is screwing the rest of us not just by using big government, but by teaming up with liberals who want to open the floodgates to foreign labor. The beauty of this message is that it combines class resentment with ethnic scapegoating. It\u2019s a dog whistle that plays chords. And it outwits the Democratic attack on outsourcing. While liberals complain about jobs being shipped overseas, they\u2019re doing something worse: They\u2019re shipping foreigners into our country, to take our jobs and drown out our votes.\n\nYou have to salute Santorum for this brilliant synthesis of manufacturing policy, class struggle, trade, border security, and voter ID. And all the while, he preserves his innocence by mentioning that he\u2019s the son of immigrants. When you come in and shut the door behind you, that\u2019s not prejudice. It\u2019s just practicality.\n\n3. Attack big business as an ally of social liberalism. Earlier this year Indiana and Arkansas debated legislation that would allow anyone to refuse business services based on religious opposition to same-sex marriage. Several gay-friendly companies opposed these bills. To some GOP leaders, this fight between business and the Christian right signified a dangerous crack in the conservative coalition. But two presidential contenders, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana, see it as an opportunity. Here\u2019s how Cruz presented the issue last month during an appearance in South Carolina:\n\nAll of us, our hearts were breaking as we saw what unfolded in Indiana and Arkansas, as those states stood up to defend religious liberty\u2014and the modern Democratic Party, in a perfect storm, joined with big business to say their commitment to mandatory gay marriage in all 50 states trumps any commitment to the First Amendment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nAnd here\u2019s how Jindal framed it two weeks later in Oklahoma:\n\nYou saw a second example when the left teamed up with corporate America to try to bully leaders in Indiana and Arkansas, when they debated their Religious Freedom Restoration Acts. By the way, this is an unholy alliance between big corporate business leaders and the radical left, the same left that wants to tax and regulate them out of existence, that doesn\u2019t believe in profits. Economic liberty is simply the other side of the same coin that is religious liberty. And my warning to those corporate leaders is: If you think you\u2019re going to come to Louisiana and bully the governor of Louisiana, don\u2019t waste your breath coming to our state and threatening us. But my advice, my warning to the Republican Party is: We\u2019re not the party of big government. We mustn\u2019t become the party of big business either.\n\nCruz and Jindal speak nobly about the Constitution and the nature of liberty. But what they\u2019re really stoking, with their talk of bullying and an unholy alliance, is Christian conservative distrust of corporate power. They\u2019re taking what was seen as an emerging asset to the gay rights movement\u2014the sympathy and muscle of business leaders\u2014and making it the target of a populist backlash.\n\nIf you\u2019re liberal, this anti-corporate rhetoric from the right can be infuriating. In an era of unrest over economic inequality, Republicans are finding ways to run against the rich and powerful. In fact, they\u2019re using populist sentiment to attack the same old enemies: regulation, subsidized health care, immigrants, and gays. How can this be happening?\n\nThe answer lies in two things you thought Republicans didn\u2019t understand: climate change and evolution. When the environment changes, organisms must adapt or die. Random mutation, combined with natural selection, either extinguishes the species or changes it.\n\nThat\u2019s what is now happening to the GOP. More than 15 Republicans, officially or unofficially, are running for president. They\u2019re trying out different messages. They face an environment of deep skepticism about social mobility under capitalism. That environment has penetrated even the Republican base. It will winnow the field, and then it will test whether the victor can prevail against the party of government intervention.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.subheadline": "How some Republican presidential candidates are running against the rich and powerful.", "fb-share": "If you\u2019re a Republican candidate for president, how do you deal with rising populism?", "sailthru.author": "William Saletan", "description": "It\u2019s a bad time to be the party of business.
