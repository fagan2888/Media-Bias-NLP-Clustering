Half the take collected during each game goes to the Buccaneers Care Foundation to benefit young people and military veterans in the region.\n\nThe other half goes to one lucky fan.\n\nWith 40,000 to 50,000 football freaks crammed into Raymond James Stadium on any given game day, that fortuitous fan could pocket tens of thousands of dollars.\n\nThe team says it\u2019s a way to raise more money for worthy causes and keeps the loyal fan base amused.\n\n\u201cThe 50/50 Raffle concept has been gaining popularity across the country in recent years and we view it as an opportunity to help raise additional funds while adding to the in-stadium fan experience,\u201d said Bucs Chief Operating Officer Brian Ford in a prepared statement. \u201cThe funds which are generated each home game during the 2014 season will add to the significant resources we have already dedicated to Bay area schools, students and military support.\u201d\n\nThe first game\u2019s jackpot totaled just over $23,000. The second game\u2019s total, which had the advantage of a lengthy rain delay in the first half that gave plenty of opportunity for game-goers to buy raffle tickets, amounted to nearly $46,000, said Bucs spokesman Nelson Luis.\n\n\u201cThe program just started with our season opener two weeks ago,\u201d he said, \u201cbut we have already seen it gain traction as evidenced by the large increase in proceeds and prize money from week one to week two.\u201d\n\nReaping half of those proceeds was the Buccaneers Care Foundation, which \u201cis heavily focused on children and students,\u201d Luis said, including support programs established in 21 Hillsborough County schools. The foundation also supports military appreciation programs and projects, he said.\n\nWhile new at Raymond James Stadium, 50/50 raffles in sports arenas are not new elsewhere.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s huge in Canada,\u201d said Tampa Bay Lightning spokesman Bill Wickett, whose organization also offers 50/50 raffle tickets during home games at the Amalie Arena.\n\n\u201cI think hockey brought it from Canada to the States,\u201d he said. \u201cLast season, we offered it every game.\u201d\n\nOne fan takes half; the other half goes to a Lightning charity.\n\n\u201cWe did it a long time ago,\u201d he said, before Jeff Vinik bought the team in 2010, \u201cbut it wasn\u2019t successful. It was like selling 50/50 tickets at a high school football game. You signed your name to the back and gave your phone number.\u201d\n\nNow the process is electronic, like dispensing lottery tickets, and raffle amounts are updated in real time. People can see how much they stand to win, he said, and that fuels the ticket-buying frenzy.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve done raffles that took in more than $30,000,\u201d Wickett said.\n\nHe said the 50/50 raffle during the 2013-14 season raised $450,000 for more than 60 charities.\n\nIn Canada, the practice is offered at various sports venues, and it appears Canadian fans are much more willing to take a chance.\n\nDuring the 2013 Grey Cup, Canada\u2019s professional football league\u2019s Super Bowl, more than $500,000 was collected from about 50,000 fans and an Ottawa man went home $257,087 richer, according to Pointbreak5050, the company hired by several sports teams in Canada to conduct their 50/50 raffles.\n\nThe take was a record jackpot for a 50/50 raffle, eclipsing the previous mark by nearly $200,000.\n\n\u201cThe Grey Cup got crazy numbers,\u201d Wickett said.\n\nCloser to home, the Jacksonville Jaguars also hold a 50/50 raffle during home games, which benefits the Jaguars Foundation. Games there only have averaged just under $7,000 a game, though.\n\nThe Tampa Bay Rays are on the bandwagon as well, offering 50/50 raffles at each of their 81 home games at Tropicana Field.\n\nRays spokesman Rick Vaughn said proceeds go to the nonprofit Ted Williams Museum and the Rays Baseball Foundation.\n\nNot everybody is happy with the trend.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s interesting with pro sports, they always are touting that gambling shouldn\u2019t take place,\u201d said Brian Kongsvik, help-line director with the Florida Council on Compulsive Gambling. \u201cYou hear it all the time about pro athletes gambling, how bad that is.\n\n\u201cThis,\u201d he said of the 50/50 raffle trend, \u201csends a mixed message about that.\u201d\n\nSports teams are becoming a part of a trend toward gaming normalcy, and Kongsvik noted that Florida\u2019s big-time college football teams and pro teams have become partners with the Florida Lottery. Five drawings between October and December offer as prizes tickets to games, team gear, season tickets for the next season and a flight and tickets to an away game. Little by little, big-time sports is tipping its hat to legal gambling.\n\nThough legal, it\u2019s still gambling, Kongsvik said, no different than the lottery, slot machines, blackjack and craps.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s chance involved,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cAny time people put something down on an uncertain outcome, it\u2019s gambling.\u201d\n\nTwo percent of the general population are compulsive gamblers and 3 to 5 percent have a betting problem, he said.\n\n\u201cSo 7 percent \u2014 that\u2019s 3,500 in a stadium of 50,000 \u2014 have some kind of gambling issue,\u201d he said, \u201cand that doesn\u2019t include those at risk of developing a problem.\u201d\n\nKongsvik said the football fan population may have more bettors than the general population, with many participating in fantasy football leagues or plunking down money in weekly office pools.\n\n\u201cFor individuals in recovery, those who have a gambling issue or those who have a propensity to develop a gambling addiction, the raffles could be a problem,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cThe whole atmosphere is pretty ripe for somebody with a problem to stumble.\u201d\n\nHe said his group raises official objections if gambling gambits are against the law, but not when they are legal, like these raffles.\n\n\u201cIf it was illegal we would speak out against it,\u201d Kongsvik said. \u201cIf it\u2019s legal, we are just here to increase awareness, to let people know about it. We are a neutral organization.\u201d\n\nThe teams that offer raffles have toed the legal line, he said, and everything about the growing raffle trend appears legitimate.\n\nFlorida statutes say raffles are legal if offered by a tax-exempt, charitable organization; raffles at the sports games typically are conducted by the nonprofit foundations formed by the teams. The Jaguars have the Jaguar Foundation and the Miami Dolphins have the Miami Dolphin Foundation and the Tampa Bay Rays have the Rays Baseball Foundation.\n\nThe Buccaneers Care Foundation recently placed advertisements for raffle vendors, or as the ad says, \u201chigh-energy, motivated sellers to join our 50/50 raffle sales team for the 2014 season.\u201d\n\n\u201cCandidates must be willing to work nights, weekends and holidays if necessary,\u201d the ad says, and\u201cmust be able to walk up and down numerous steps and long distances in parking lot and stadium grounds.\u201d\n\nThe Bucs began offering the raffle without approval from the stadium\u2019s owner, the Tampa Sports Authority. But the team really didn\u2019t need permission, said Bobby Silvest, spokesman for the authority.\n\n\u201cAll I can tell you is that I know they are doing it,\u201d he said. The Buccaneers did not clear the raffle idea with the authority because, well, they were not required to.\n\n\u201cThey are the tenant,\u201d Silvest said, \u201cand they do their own programming there.\u201d\n\nkmorelli@tampatrib.com\n\n(813) 259-7760", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sat, 20 Sep 2014 22:13:54 -0400", "Description": "TAMPA \u2014 Raffles at Moose and Elks lodges and even at the weekly church social might yield a couple of hundred bucks, but raffles at professional sporting events can be much more lucrative, and", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "TAMPA \u2014 Raffles at Moose and Elks lodges and even at the weekly church social might yield a couple of hundred bucks, but raffles at professional sporting events can be much more lucrative, and", "title": "Bucs promotion is legal, but does it encourage gambling?", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/news/breaking-news/bucs-promotion-is-legal-but-does-it-encourage-gambling-20140920/", "image": {"width": 1450, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20140920/ARTICLE/140929923/AR/0/AR-140929923.jpg", "height": 1108}, "updated_time": "2014-09-20T22:13:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "tbo.com", "description": "TAMPA \u2014 Raffles at Moose and Elks lodges and even at the weekly church social might yield a couple of hundred bucks, but raffles at professional sporting events can be much more lucrative, a", "title": "Bucs promotion is legal, but does it encourage gambling?", "image": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20140920/ARTICLE/140929923/AR/0/AR-140929923.jpg", "site": "@TBOcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2014-09-20T22:13:54Z-04", "modified_time": "2014-09-20T22:13:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfb05\"", "article_summary": "Little by little, big-time sports is tipping its hat to legal gambling.\nWhile new at Raymond James Stadium, 50/50 raffles in sports arenas are not new elsewhere.\nThe take was a record jackpot for a 50/50 raffle, eclipsing the previous mark by nearly $200,000.\n\u201cIt\u2019s huge in Canada,\u201d said Tampa Bay Lightning spokesman Bill Wickett, whose organization also offers 50/50 raffle tickets during home games at the Amalie Arena.\nIt was like selling 50/50 tickets at a high school football game."}
