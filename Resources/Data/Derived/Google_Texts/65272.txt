Connecticut State Police say a trooper has been shot to death during a hunting trip in Texas

HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) — Connecticut State Police say a veteran trooper has been shot to death during a hunting trip in Texas.

Trooper 1st Class Stephen Davis died Saturday on the Cinco Ranch in Maverick County. He was a 27-year veteran of the state police.

The Maverick County sheriff's department says the 50-year-old Davis was hit by a shot fired by a hunter from Maine. That hunter told authorities he was trying to shoot a wild hog.

The sheriff's office said Tuesday that no charges had been filed, but the shooting remains under investigation.

Davis began his career with the state police in 1988. He worked out of the Troop C barracks in Tolland. He was from Hebron.

Cinco Ranch in Maverick County is about 150 miles southwest of San Antonio.
