The event will take place on Aug. 26 from 7 to 9 p.m. and will offer wine and snacks for both humans and dogs (snacks only for the dogs).\n\nNational Dog Day was created in 2004 by Colleen Paige to show appreciation for dogs and their endearing patience, unquestioning loyalty and capacity for love.\n\nLiz Weber understands dog love first hand. Her life began to unravel when her dog, Rufus, died of old age. She was forced to let go of the one constant in her life and move forward. \u201cMemory Card Full\u201d is a memoir of her life as a bartender, model and aspiring writer in Manhattan before and after Rufus.\n\nWeber\u2019s memoir charts her course through grief and ends at her realization that there were important things in life that Rufus\u2019 love had caused her to avoid. She is finally able to accept that letting go of him is the best way to go on and find love for herself and others.\n\nThe Aug. 26 event begins at 7 p.m. The Brooklyn Heights Veterinary Hospital is located at 59 Hicks St. in Brooklyn Heights.\n\n* * *\n\nLiz Weber is a freelance writer living in Brooklyn.
