She finds Rhodes irresistible and puts him on the air. Rhodes becomes a sensation, eventually climbing the ladder to his own network TV show and then, as politicians approach him for endorsements, a self-described kingmaker.\n\nI think of Rhodes when I watch Donald Trump. The two have much in common. Rhodes\u2018 view of women seems to mirror Mr. Trump\u2018s. In one scene, Rhodes says, \u201cA guitar beats a woman every time.\u201d He marries more than once and has several affairs during and in between those marriages.\n\nAs he becomes intoxicated with a beverage clearly not the milk of human kindness, Rhodes brags: \u201cI\u2019m not just an entertainer. I\u2019m an influence, a wielder of opinion, a force a force!\u201d\n\nLater as his political and cultural demise approaches, Rhodes says this about his audience when he thinks the microphone is off (Jeffries has kept it on to expose him as a fraud and make amends for creating a monster): \u201cThose morons out there? Shucks, I could take chicken fertilizer and sell it to them as caviar. I could make them eat dog food and think it was steak. You know what the public\u2019s like? A cage of guinea pigs. Good night, you stupid idiots. Good night, you miserable slobs. They\u2019re a lot of trained seals. I toss them a dead fish and they\u2019ll flap their flippers.\u201d\n\nRent or buy the film if you haven\u2019t seen it. Think of Mr. Trump as you watch Lonesome Rhodes, his rise and eventual fall, as ego and arrogance lead to the self-immolation of his career and life.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s braggadocio about how he plans to bully Russian President Vladimir Putin and free American hostages held by Iran, even before he is sworn in as president, excites his supporters, but lacks any credible specifics. Perhaps Mr. Trump thinks the force of his personality is greater than Russian weaponry or the coming Iranian nuclear bomb. If so, he should not be allowed anywhere near the Oval Office.\n\nMr. Trump has tapped into a deep anger among many members of the public who hate Washington and its dysfunction. He rightly lambasts politicians who rarely live up to their promises and especially Republicans for too often surrendering to Democrats, a party to which until fairly recently he belonged. But if he wants to tear down the establishment, he must offer something of substance in its place.\n\nMr. Trump is a chameleon, having held contradictory positions on various issues over the years as it suits him. He fits the dictionary.com definition of demagogue: \u201cA person, especially an orator or political leader, who gains power and popularity by arousing the emotions, passions, and prejudices of the people.\u201d That\u2019s Lonesome Rhodes. That\u2019s also Donald Trump.\n\nMr. Trump is a serial violator (and he\u2019s not alone in this) of Ronald Reagan\u2019s \u201c11th Commandment,\u201d which states that Republicans are never to speak ill of a fellow Republican. There\u2019s a good reason for this. If Republicans trash Republicans, by the time a nominee is chosen, the party has given Democrats a slew of disparaging sound bites they can use as political ammo in the general election campaign. Not a smart move.\n\nIn the film, Mel Miller (Matthau) delivers one of Schulberg\u2019s best lines about Rhodes: \u201cI\u2019ll say one thing for him, he\u2019s got the courage of his ignorance.\u201d\n\nSo does Mr. Trump, who, to give just one example, claims the Bible is his favorite book, but can\u2019t name any of its chapters, or even a single verse. Lonesome Rhodes would have known how to fake it. Mr. Trump might consult the Gideon version in any of his hotel rooms.\n\n\u2022 Cal Thomas is a nationally syndicated columnist.
