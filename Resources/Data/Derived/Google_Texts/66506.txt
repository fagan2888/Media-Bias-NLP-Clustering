At this point in New Jersey's endless blizzard of a winter, hearing about an upcoming storm creates angst among those who have endured long commutes or spent long, arduous hours shoveling out their cars.

Unfortunately, another storm is expected Tuesday night. But this one may spare your beleaguered joints.

Although the National Weather Service said there's a 40 percent chance significant snowfall will hit the state late Tuesday into Wednesday, it's also possible most of the snow will miss us.

"I would say the potential is there for a disruptive storm with several inches of snow," said Brian Edwards, a meteorologist with AccuWeather.

There are two weather systems in the U.S. right now that are set to combine over the Mid-Atlantic region, according to Edwards.

If those two systems — one moving up the East Coast from the Gulf, the other traveling across the Great Lakes and through New England — come together early on, we could be in for a wicked Hump Day, forecasters said.

But if those systems collide later on in their paths, and take a track further out to sea, we could get lucky and get just a dusting of snow.

Right now, forecasters say it's simply too early to tell where those two storms might meet, or when, which means they can't tell us how much snow we may get.

"It's all gonna be timing," Edwards said.

"There will be potential for some accumulation," said weather service meteorologist Mitchell Gaines, "but we really haven't dived into what the totals could be, because of the uncertainty."

One thing the meteorologists can say for sure is those refreshingly mild temperatures New Jersey enjoyed over the weekend are gone, at least for a while.

Starting Tuesday, daytime highs are not expected to top 32. The sub-freezing temperatures will hang over the state until at least Saturday.
