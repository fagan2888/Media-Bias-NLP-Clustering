However, establishment Republicans have focused too much on who they could nominate and not enough on the critical issues their nominee must address to win the general election.\n\nClinton has staked out positions on free trade, health care, education and gender equity, and the GOP standard bearer will have to veer from traditional party positions on those issues to have any chance of winning.\n\nBlind allegiance to free trade, internationally, is akin to denying the federal government a role in regulating markets and monopolies, domestically, to assure fair competition and efficient outcomes.\n\nThree of our largest trading partners \u2014 China, Japan and Germany \u2014 abuse their size to victimize smaller nations and American workers. Either the GOP gets on board with fixing currency manipulation and toughening up trade agreements, as Clinton has lately endorsed, or it is dead in the water. Simply, many of Trump\u2019s non-college educated supporters will sit out the election and hand victory to Clinton.\n\nAmericans can\u2019t compete without better access to skills-based education but Hillary Clinton\u2019s proposal to make college free\u2014including room and board\u2014is absolute folly.\n\nExperience teaches, when the federal government increases student aid, universities spend the additional money badly. Nowadays, 40 percent of college graduates lack the basic skills necessary for entry level white collar work.\n\nBetter to redirect much of what is spent on higher education toward vocational training and strictly condition aid on successful job placement. Also, impose student exit examinations on universities to qualify for federal aid and shut some second-tier institutions.\n\nObamacare is a bust. Health insurance is still prohibitively expensive, even if you are willing to settle for a $5000 deductible, and the federal and state websites are downright maddening. However, promising to bring back the regime of George W. Bush by repealing it and offering tax breaks and other subsidies won\u2019t wash with voters.\n\nTrump\u2019s mussing about a British-style single payer system has no traction, but the Germans and Dutch pay much less for health care with private insurance systems that regulate markets differently, not more, than our system. The GOP should embrace those as a model for reform.\n\nGender is Hillary\u2019s trump card.\n\nMany women, especially older women who were the victims of discrimination in their youth, believe a female president is needed to \u201cbreak down barriers\u201d even if those are now largely gone.\n\nCurrently, about 60 percent of the college degrees are granted to women and young women earn more than young men in many circumstances. The Economist newspaper, hardly a conservative mouthpiece, accuses Democrats of cynically distorting this issue to win elections.\n\nThe gender pay gap has many sources\u2014and subtle residual discrimination may be one factor but so are choices women make about career paths, hours worked and being with young children.\n\nClinton\u2019s notion of a national version of the California Paycheck Fairness Act, which requires even the smallest businesses to justify all pay differences between men and women to government supervisors, would be a bureaucratic nightmare and compliance costs would lower wages generally.\n\nA better solution would be to mandate that businesses publish the compensation of all employees\u2014transparency is the best antidote to latent discrimination.\n\nThese are radical ideas for Republicans to embrace but leveling the playing field in markets, looking for more cost effective solutions when domestic industries are inefficient, and laying bare remaining wage discrimination would promote economic growth.\n\nIn case establishment Republicans haven\u2019t heard, those are key performance metrics for conservative policies and would improve opportunities and fairness for all Americans.\n\nPeter Morici is an economist and business professor at the University of Maryland, and a national columnist.
