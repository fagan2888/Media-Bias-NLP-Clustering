We started this business because we wanted to help people across the country make their house feel like a home. But today, the health and well being of our business is being threatened by legislation in Congress that, if approved, could create enormous compliance costs, the risk of an intrusive government audit, the risk of litigation, and all-around endless complexities.\n\nThis bill, known as the Remote Transactions Parity Act (RTPA), aims to find a way forward on a fair and reasonable system for collecting Internet Sales Tax. But in reality, it\u2019s a bad bill that should be stopped.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nFor starters, the legislation offers businesses like mine the promise of \u201cfree\u201d software to help comply with the law. But this software comes with great complexity, huge costs, and it increases the risk of government audit.\n\nRTPA mandates businesses like ours to use software to help comply with the complex web of state and local tax laws. One example of this software is TaxCloud, which in theory handles the calculation, collection and filing involved with sales tax compliance. But in reality, TaxCloud creates huge burdens for small businesses like ours. First, we would need to pay an e-commerce provider as much as $25,000 dollars to add tax identification codes to our existing data system. Next, we\u2019d need to pay up to $35,000 for an outside programmer to modify our order processing system. We would be responsible for accurately setting the tax identification code on each of our 15,000 products by studying each tax jurisdiction\u2019s tax identification code regulations.\n\nSo far, we\u2019re up to $60,000, but that\u2019s just the beginning. Our order management system was written in an older programming language, so it\u2019s unclear whether modifications to the system are possible. If they aren\u2019t possible, we\u2019d need to replace the system entirely. I\u2019ve collected quotes for a replacement, and they range from $150,000 to $500,000.\n\nCompliance with the bill would also require us to devote staff to data entry and due diligence regarding tax holidays and other special details. We\u2019d also have to spend time double-checking the software handling of returns or exchanges.\n\nFinally, language in the bill opens the door to intrusive government audit from any one of 46 sales-tax states.\n\nIn the face of this awful bill, we were pleased to learn that House Judiciary Committee Bob Goodlatte Bob GoodlatteIRS head vows to finish term despite impeachment push House Republicans press case for impeaching IRS commissioner Saudis scramble for Washington allies MORE (R-Va.) is exploring an alternative approach that would be a streamlined and straightforward way to apply sales tax to online purchases.\n\nThe aim of the Internet sales tax is to create a level playing field, and we have no problem with this goal. The Goodlatte alternative achieves this without creating new costs and new problems, while RTPA does not.\n\nAs a small business, we work day and night to put out our catalog every month, fulfill orders, answer customer service inquiries, and help our customers in every way possible. But RTPA would force us to spend an inordinate amount of time and energy complying with the tax laws of jurisdictions across the nation, which certainly won\u2019t help us build our business or serve our customers as effectively.\n\nWe urge members of Congress to seriously consider the Goodlatte approach, which allows us to focus on our customers, rather than pay tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars on implementing tax software. Small businesses like ours don\u2019t deserve to be ambushed by hidden costs.\n\nThe Bell family owns and operates Touch of Class, a Huntingburg, Indiana-based catalog and online home furnishings retailer.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "It\u2019s a bad bill that should be stopped.", "description": "It\u2019s a bad bill that should be stopped.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Congress Blog"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "It\u2019s a bad bill that should be stopped.", "title": "RTPA: A hidden tax on small businesses", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/economy-budget/260137-rtpa-a-hidden-tax-on-small-businesses", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-01T06:17:42-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-01T06:17-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/economy-budget/260137-rtpa-a-hidden-tax-on-small-businesses", "dcterms.date": "2015-11-16T13:00-05:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Joe Picard", "author": "Fred and Gary Bell", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",Bob Goodlatte,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-16T13:00:03-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-01T06:17:42-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/economy-budget/260137-rtpa-a-hidden-tax-on-small-businesses", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "It\u2019s a bad bill that should be stopped.", "card": "summary", "title": "RTPA: A hidden tax on small businesses"}, "dcterms.title": "RTPA: A hidden tax on small businesses"}, "article_summary": "Small businesses like ours don\u2019t deserve to be ambushed by hidden costs.\nBut in reality, TaxCloud creates huge burdens for small businesses like ours.\nRTPA mandates businesses like ours to use software to help comply with the complex web of state and local tax laws.\nWe would be responsible for accurately setting the tax identification code on each of our 15,000 products by studying each tax jurisdiction\u2019s tax identification code regulations.\nThe aim of the Internet sales tax is to create a level playing field, and we have no problem with this goal."}
