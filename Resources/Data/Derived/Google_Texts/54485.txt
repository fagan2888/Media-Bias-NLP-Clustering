Authorities have found human remains in Kansas City, Kansas, while investigating the disappearance of a 7-month-old boy.

Police said in a news release that the investigation began after officers responded Wednesday to an armed disturbance. An allegation was made during the investigation that the baby had been missing for "an extended period of time" and was possibly dead at a nearby residence.

While serving a search warrant Thursday tied to the missing baby allegation, human remains were discovered. The human remains haven't been identified, and no other information was immediately available.

Authorities said the investigation is ongoing. Anyone with information is urged to come forward.
