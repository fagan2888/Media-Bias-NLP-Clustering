These bills are called \u201cReligious Freedom Restoration Acts\u201d (RFRA), but don\u2019t be fooled. These lawmakers are looking to codify LGBTQ discrimination.\n\nThis week the Georgia Senate, with a vote of 37-15, approved controversial RFRA (House Bill 1023). The bill doesn\u2019t want the state\u2019s Christian religious conservatives, fundamentalists and evangelicals to \u201csubstantially burden\u201d their personal religious practices and beliefs.\n\nWhat, you may ask, could possibly be such a burden to Christians in Georgia that a state law is necessitated?\n\nBurden, according the bill, is defined as:\n\n\"'Burden' means any government action or implementation or application of any law, including, but not limited to, state and local laws, ordinances, rules, regulations, and policies, whether statutory or otherwise, that directly or indirectly constrains, inhibits, curtails, or denies the exercise of religion by any person or that directly or indirectly pressures any person to engage in any action contrary to that person's exercise of religion, including, but not limited to, withholding benefits, assessing criminal, civil, or administrative penalties, and exclusion from government programs or access to government facilities.\u201d\n\nBut let\u2019s be clear, the only religious folk lawmakers hope to protect from a \u201csubstantially burden\u201d is Christians. Jews, Muslims, Buddhists, and other non-Christian Georgians don\u2019t merit protection. As a matter-of-fact, these demographic groups \u2014 along with atheists and LGBTQs \u2014 can easily be subject to egregious forms of discrimination, bigotry and hate crimes under the guise of religion.\n\nFor example, the Atlanta-based family-owned fast food fried chicken chain Chick-fil-A can now with the state\u2019s sanctioning of House Bill 1023 openly and legally discriminate in their hiring practices of Jews, divorcees or LGBTQ people based on their Southern Baptist beliefs.\n\nIn June 2012, controversy arose when it was disclosed that the company\u2019s founder S. Truett Cathy and his family donated millions of dollars to groups across the country opposing same-sex marriage. S. Truett Cathy through The WinShape Foundation, the chain\u2019s charitable organization, flatly barred same-sex couples from participating in the foundation\u2019s marriage retreats.\n\n\u201cReligious Freedom Restoration Acts\u201d like Georgia\u2019s are springing up around the country. And the bogus claims look like this in justifying denying services to same-sex couples:\n\n* A family-owned bakery in Gresham, Oregon called \u201cSweet Cakes by Melissa\u201d wanted to \u201cpractice their Constitutional right to religious freedom.\u201d\n\n* A florist in Washington state wanted to maintain her \u201crelationship with Jesus.\u201d\n\n* A photography company in New Mexico would \u201cgladly serve gays and lesbians\u201d by taking portraits. But photographing same-sex marriages or commitment ceremonies would \u201crequire them to create expression conveying messages that conflict with their religious beliefs.\u201d\n\nSweet Cakes by Melissa owners closed the family shop and moved the business to their home making it clear LGBTQ dollars are not wanted.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t have a right to be served in every single store,\u201d Oklahoma state Sen. Joseph Silk said, referring to gay people. \u201cPeople need to have the ability to refuse service if it violates their religious convictions.\u201d\n\nWhile South Dakota\u2019s and Arkansas\u2019s RFRA failed to advance in their state\u2019s legislative sessions, North Carolina\u2019s and Alabama\u2019s bill did. In same-sex marriage equality states (like North Carolina and Alabama), state judges and state employers like justices of the peace can refuse to officiate same-sex nuptials and private businesses can refuse services to same-sex couples citing it violates their religious belief.\n\nThe argument cited by religious conservatives for discrimination against LGBTQ Americans is not confined geographically. And the last place one expects not to see this type of discrimination rearing its head is liberal Massachusetts. But it has.\n\nGordon College, a small conservative Christian college on the North Shore, prides itself on upholding the tenets of religious freedom. And in so doing, the college tested its boundaries with the recent Supreme Court case Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores.\n\nThe Hobby Lobby ruling last year allowed family-owned corporations to cite religious objections to opt out of the nation\u2019s Affordable Care Act (ACA). ACA required employers to cover certain contraceptives for women. Gordon\u2019s president D. Michael Lindsay \u2014 along with 14 influential religious leaders from across the country \u2014 asked President Barack Obama for an exemption banning discrimination in hiring on the basis of sexual orientation. (Immediately following the Hobby Lobby decision, the U.S. Supreme Court granted Wheaton College, another evangelical Christian liberal arts college outside of Chicago, a temporary injunction allowing the college to refuse providing contraception.)\n\nLindsay and his band of homophobes framed their request to the President, by email, c/o Melissa Rogers, executive director, White House Office of Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships, under the guise of \"religious freedom.\"\n\nThis was hardly, though, the first time a Massachusetts school has tried to paint discrimination as religious freedom.\n\nAs recently as January 2014, the Gay & Lesbian Advocates & Defenders (GLAD) filed a complaint against Fontbonne Academy, a religious college prep school in Milton, Massachusetts, when the school fired Matt Barrett \u2014 after offering him employment at the school as food services director \u2014 when he stated on a form that his spouse was a male.\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019m planning and making meals for students, I\u2019m not sure what my being gay has to do with the job,\u201d Barrett said. \u201cI\u2019ve always done well in my work, and was excited about working at Fontbonne. All I did was fill out the form honestly.\u201d\n\nThe Religious Freedom Restoration Acts springing up across the country are a backlash to the growing acceptance of same-sex marriage and the growing fear of when the U.S. Supreme Court legalize it nationwide. They are a perversion of the Constitution and our history of religious freedom.\n\n* * *\n\nThe Rev.
