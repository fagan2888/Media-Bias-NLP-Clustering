Removable sensors in the bra \u2013 or battery powered \u201cconductive pads\u201d \u2013 monitor heart and skin activity to determine the wearer\u2019s mood levels and how mood changes might contribute to stress-induced overeating.\n\nRelated: Breastaurants Grow to Over $2 Billion in Annual Sales\n\nThe mood data is streamed to the wearer via a smartphone app \u2013 and helps to indicate when emotional eating is most likely to occur so that those impulses can be redirected, according to a BBC report.\n\nIn their paper, published online and entitled \u201cFood and Mood: Just-in-Time Support for Emotional Eating,\u201d the researchers said using a bra \u201cwas ideal because it allowed us to collect EKG [data] near the heart.\u201d\n\nWith emotional eating, they said, their goal \u201cis to provide an intervention before the [stressed] person turns to food for emotional support\u2026 This is the first study that we are aware of that makes use of wearable, mobile sensors for detecting emotions\u2026. Based on the results, we conclude that building a wearable, physiological system is feasible.\u201d\n\nThe researchers caution that right now sensors need to be recharged every few hours and that the smart bra is uncomfortable when worn for hours at a time.\n\nRelated: Why a Smartphone Knows If You\u2019re Sick Before You Do\n\nThe scientists involved in the project are from Microsoft, the University of Rochester and the University of Southampton in the U.K.\n\nOne participant of the study noted that she was \u201ceating without being aware of it, but by having to log both my eating habits and my emotions, I became aware of triggers for emotional eating, and also more aware of the health (or lack thereof) in my diet.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson from Microsoft told CNN in an email that the \u201cbra sensing system is just one instance of a class of work from a group of Microsoft researchers that is focused on the broader topic of affecting computing, or designed devices and services that are sensitive to people\u2019s moods and react accordingly.\u201d\n\nThe spokesperson also said, \u201cWhile we will continue our research in affective computing, Microsoft has no plans to develop a bra with sensors.\u201d\n\nThe researchers have a bold plan, however. They say they want to build a robust system that \u201cstands up to everyday challenges with regards to battery life, comfortability and suitability for both men and women.\u201d\n\nWearable tech is hardly a new idea, of course \u2013 but the intimate apparel applications have some people unnerved. On Twitter, a woman named Rachel Happe tweeted, \u201cIf nothing else convinces you we need more women in tech, this should. No, I don\u2019t want someone hacking my bra\u2026\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "This could be the biggest thing to hit the world of intimate apparel in years \u2013 and th", "title": "Now, Even Your Bra Could Be Hacked", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2013/12/06/Now-Even-Your-Bra-Could-Be-Hacked", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/12062013_Bra_Hacking.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2013/12/06/Now-Even-Your-Bra-Could-Be-Hacked", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/12062013_Bra_Hacking.png", "creator": "@maurmack", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "This could be the biggest thing to hit the world of intimate apparel in years \u2013 and th", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2116\"", "article_summary": "A prototype for a \u201csmart bra\u201d that can detect the presence of stress in the wearer has been designed by Microsoft scientists and other researchers.\nRemovable sensors in the bra \u2013 or battery powered \u201cconductive pads\u201d \u2013 monitor heart and skin activity to determine the wearer\u2019s mood levels and how mood changes might contribute to stress-induced overeating.\nThis could be the biggest thing to hit the world of intimate apparel in years \u2013 and the biggest boon for creative hackers, too.\nOn Twitter, a woman named Rachel Happe tweeted, \u201cIf nothing else convinces you we need more women in tech, this should.\nBased on the results, we conclude that building a wearable, physiological system is feasible.\u201dThe researchers caution that right now sensors need to be recharged every few hours and that the smart bra is uncomfortable when worn for hours at a time."}
