Rick Scott was correct to veto $1 million in the state budget that was going to help promote the ban on texting while driving.\n\nSuffice to say, Florida's texting while driving law \u2014 which was long overdue \u2014 is weak. Florida became the 41st state to ban texting while driving, but the violation will be a secondary offense, meaning drivers must be pulled over for another reason. And it's fine to text if you are idling at a red light.\n\nStill, it is about to become law, which is an improvement over what we had. As for the need for such a law, a study released earlier this year showed about 3,000 teens die in accidents caused by texting every year. The National Safety Council said about 28 percent of traffic accidents \u2014 about 1.6 million crashed per year \u2014 involve drivers talking on cellphones or texting.\n\nIf you have a driver's license, you know that it's dangerous to text. And Florida is finally catching up with the rest of the nation in making it illegal. You will pay $30 plus court costs for a first offense and $60 for a second offense.\n\nFor a long time \u2014 and particularly earlier this year when the Legislature debated and finally adopted a texting law pushed by state Sen. Maria Sachs, D-Delray Beach \u2014 media outlets of all types throughout the state gave the law loads of free publicity. The same will happen in the coming days as the law goes into effect.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "oped, editorials, opinion", "og": {"url": "http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2013-09-18/news/fl-editorial-texting-driving-gs-20130918_1_texting-law-new-state-law-dangers", "site_name": "tribunedigital-sunsentinel", "type": "article", "description": "It is safe to say most Floridians who drive know that texting while driving is dangerous.
