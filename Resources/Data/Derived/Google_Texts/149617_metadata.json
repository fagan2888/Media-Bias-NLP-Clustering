Main St.\n\nWitnesses told police the woman yelled at the homeless man for sleeping on the Fallen Firefighter Memorial and then kicked him. One of the men, a Seattle firefighter, hit the man with a stick and the third, another firefighter, joined in the attack. The homeless man stood up to defend himself and stabbed one of the firefighters with a knife.\n\nThe stabbed firefighter was taken to Harborview Medical Center with non-life threatening injuries. The other two suspects were not injured and the homeless man refused treatment at the scene.\n\nThe man and woman were booked into King County Jail for assault. All three suspects will face assault charges.\n\nSeattle Fire Department spokeswoman Lt. Sue Stangl confirmed the involvement of the firefighters. She said the department is still looking at what happened and doesn\u2019t have a full statement yet.\n\nShe said the firefighters are 15- and 17-year veterans of the Fire Department. The woman involved is not part of the department.\n\nShe said one of them has been on disability since January, while the other had last worked last Thursday.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Two people being investigated for assault after a fight in Pioneer Square Saturday night were reportedly off-duty Seattle firefighters.", "og": {"site_name": "MyNorthwest.com", "description": "Two people being investigated for assault after a fight in Pioneer Square Saturday night were reportedly off-duty Seattle firefighters.", "title": "Two off-duty Seattle firefighters investigated for attacking homeless man", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 980, "identifier": "http://mynorthwest.com/wp-content/uploads/cms/10/1073/107323.jpg", "height": 451}, "updated_time": "2014-03-16T21:08:09-07:00", "url": "http://mynorthwest.com/22713/two-off-duty-seattle-firefighters-investigated-for-attacking-homeless-man/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://mynorthwest.com/wp-content/uploads/cms/10/1073/107323.jpg", "creator": "@stephklein", "description": "Two people being investigated for assault after a fight in Pioneer Square Saturday night were reportedly off-duty Seattle firefighters.", "card": "summary", "title": "Two off-duty Seattle firefighters investigated for attacking homeless man"}, "robots": "noodp", "keywords": "MyNorthwest.com - Seattle news, sports, weather, traffic, talk and community., Home,MyNorthwest.com", "article": {"section": "Local News", "published_time": "2014-03-16T07:53:08-07:00", "modified_time": "2014-03-16T21:08:09-07:00", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/mynorthwest#!/pages/MyNorthwestcom/69444144090"}, "verify-v1": "XrJiQDsWmPaoqGKN0EHKs7ult0rBB0W9zj4cWkAPRVI=", "viewport": "width=device-width, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The homeless man stood up to defend himself and stabbed one of the firefighters with a knife.\nWitnesses told police the woman yelled at the homeless man for sleeping on the Fallen Firefighter Memorial and then kicked him.\nTwo people being investigated for assault after a fight in Pioneer Square Saturday night were off-duty Seattle firefighters.\nThe other two suspects were not injured and the homeless man refused treatment at the scene.\nThe stabbed firefighter was taken to Harborview Medical Center with non-life threatening injuries."}
