His very first vote will be for Speaker of the House, and the chairman of the Pottawattamie County Republican Party, Jeff Jorgensen, called on him in an open letter to vote against Speaker John Boehner\u2019s re-election.\n\nHere is the text of the letter:\n\nDear Congressman Young, On November 4, 2014 Republicans won a resounding victory on behalf of the American people. The voters spoke on that day, and what they said was, \u201cSTOP President Obama and his unconstitutional transformation of America.\u201d Since that time, President Obama\u2019s agenda has been anything but stopped. Most egregious to conservative Republicans were the actions of House Speaker John Boehner and his leadership team during the lame-duck session. Speaker Boehner and his team, with the help of President Obama, force through a 1,774-page $1.1 trillion omnibus spending bill. Not one member of the House of Representatives had time to read the bill before it passed. This bill materially enables most of President Obama\u2019s agenda items, including Obamacare and executive amnesty, by providing funding for them. It has become blatantly obvious that Speaker Boehner has been ineffective in opposing President Obama\u2019s agenda since becoming Speaker in 2010. Simply put, Speaker Boehner has been politically out-classed, and will continue to be ineffective in mounting any kind of opposition that would roll back the President\u2019s agenda. As such, on behalf of Pottawattamie County Republican Executive Committee members Jan Tatum and Myra Nixon, I ask that you vote against John Boehner for Speaker of the House when the new Congress convenes this week. Signed, Jeff Jorgenson \u2013 Chairman Pottawattamie County Republican Central Committee", "article_metadata": {"shareaholic": {"site_name": "Caffeinated Thoughts", "language": "en-US", "url": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/2015/01/pottawattamie-county-gop-leadership-david-young-vote-boehner/", "article_author_name": "Shane Vander Hart", "image": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/15450698499_75f5102025_o-1024x576.jpg", "site_id": "965f58835b5900850067f65116487024", "article_published_time": "2015-01-05T19:00:53+00:00", "shareable_page": "true", "article_modified_time": "2016-05-26T05:30:14+00:00", "keywords": "david young, jeff jorgensen, john boehner, pottawattamie county republicans, iowa news & politics", "wp_version": "7.7.1.0"}, "description": "Pottawattamie County Republican Party Executive Committee members called on Congressman-elect David Young to vote against Speaker John Boehner's reelection.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Caffeinated Thoughts", "description": "Pottawattamie County Republican Party Executive Committee members called on Congressman-elect David Young to vote against Speaker John Boehner's reelection.", "title": "Pottawattamie County GOP Leadership to David Young: Vote Against Boehner | Caffeinated Thoughts", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/15450698499_75f5102025_o-1024x576.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-01-05T13:01:12-05:00", "url": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/2015/01/pottawattamie-county-gop-leadership-david-young-vote-boehner/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Pottawattamie County Republican Party Executive Committee members called on Congressman-elect David Young to vote against Speaker John Boehner's reelection.", "creator": "@shanevanderhart", "image": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/15450698499_75f5102025_o.jpg", "title": "Pottawattamie County GOP Leadership to David Young: Vote Against Boehner | Caffeinated Thoughts", "site": "@CaffThoughts", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 259594777484510}, "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/CaffThoughts", "published_time": "2015-01-05T13:00:53-05:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/shanevanderhart", "section": "Iowa News & Politics", "modified_time": "2015-01-05T13:01:12-05:00", "tag": "Pottawattamie County Republicans"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Most egregious to conservative Republicans were the actions of House Speaker John Boehner and his leadership team during the lame-duck session.\nIt has become blatantly obvious that Speaker Boehner has been ineffective in opposing President Obama\u2019s agenda since becoming Speaker in 2010.\nThis bill materially enables most of President Obama\u2019s agenda items, including Obamacare and executive amnesty, by providing funding for them.\nSpeaker Boehner and his team, with the help of President Obama, force through a 1,774-page $1.1 trillion omnibus spending bill.\nHis very first vote will be for Speaker of the House, and the chairman of the Pottawattamie County Republican Party, Jeff Jorgensen, called on him in an open letter to vote against Speaker John Boehner\u2019s re-election."}
