The Small Business Health Options exchanges, as they are known, went live on Tuesday, and businesses that go browsing \u2013 they won\u2019t be able to buy online until November \u2014 are discovering a new concept for comparing the offerings: metal levels.\n\nMetal levels are how health plans for small businesses must now distinguish themselves according to their actuarial values, which is the share of expected medical expenses that a health plan will cover. For small businesses and individuals, the Affordable Care Act defines four levels of actuarial value: a bronze plan covers 60 percent of expected costs, a silver plan covers 70 percent, a gold plan covers 80 percent, and a platinum plan covers 90 percent. The enrollee pays the rest, through deductibles, co-payments, coinsurance, or other cost-sharing mechanisms.\n\nSounds relatively simple, right? Not to Alan Cohen, co-founder and chief strategy officer of Liazon, a company that operates a private benefits exchange for employers. On Liazon\u2019s private exchange, client companies can give each employee a certain amount of money to spend on benefits, and the employee can pick among several types of benefit plans. The Times has just published an interview with Mr. Cohen about his company and how the Affordable Care Act will affect small businesses.\n\nIn a related conversation, Mr. Cohen decried the metal levels as a \u201cbad unintended consequence\u201d of the new law. For one thing he said, the metal tiers imply increasing quality. \u201cExcept that they chose to make the dimension of the metal only one thing, which is cost-sharing,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are lots of dimensions of what makes a plan good or bad beyond cost-sharing, like network size. A company offers really rich benefits but denies every claim, they\u2019ll be platinum.\u201d\n\nThe metal level scheme \u201cdramatically reduces the number of plans a company can offer.\u201d Insurers now have to hew to the thresholds set by the law \u2014 they cannot offer, say, a 65-percent actuarial value plan. But if metal levels are meant to simplify matters, he said, they don\u2019t:\n\nMetal levels don\u2019t standardize; in fact, they confuse. A silver plan is 70 percent of actuarial value, but for all intents and purposes, there are an infinite number of ways to get to 70 percent. One plan could have a $2,000 deductible, and everything else covered at 100 percent. Another plan could have a $500 deductible and cover 70 percent to a $3,000 maximum. Another plan could have no deductible at all but have a $1,000 deductible for prescription drugs. Personally I think it infantilizes people. People don\u2019t need metal levels to know if something is good or bad.\n\nWhat do you think? If you have thoughts about the metal system, we\u2019d like to hear from you in the space below.
