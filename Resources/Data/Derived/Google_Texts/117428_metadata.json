But the stakes in King v. Burwell, which the court will hear on March 4, could scarcely be higher: If the plaintiffs prevail, millions of people in 34 states who bought insurance on federal exchanges would suddenly lose the subsidies that make it affordable. Consequently, most would lose their coverage. A Rand study pegged the number at 9.6 million people, with premiums soaring 47 percent for those still able to afford them. \u201cEveryone agrees this would be a cataclysmic hit to the insurance market,\u201d Michael Kolber, a health-care attorney at Manatt, Phelps & Phillips, said at a Feb. 13 Bloomberg Intelligence panel on King v. Burwell.\n\nThe immediate effect of a ruling against the ACA would be to hurl the political system, and no small part of the economy, into chaos. Yet there\u2019s little sign that Washington is preparing for that scenario. Democrats won\u2019t talk about what they would do because they don\u2019t want the court to believe they could contain the fallout. Republicans don\u2019t want to talk because they\u2019re loath to admit that, even after voting 67 times to repeal or defund the ACA, they have no plan to help the millions who would be affected. (But they\u2019d sure love the court to kill the law anyway.) Hospitals and insurers understand that bewailing their financial plight might not help their cause. Instead, they\u2019ve channeled their warnings into amicus briefs.\n\nA notable exception to this monkish silence is Stuart Butler of the Brookings Institution in Washington. Butler, 67, is the Zelig of modern health-care reform, present at every critical stage. In 1993, as a scholar at the conservative Heritage Foundation, he designed a health-care plan around an individual mandate that became the main alternative to the Clinton administration\u2019s plan. A decade later, when he soured on the mandate, many conservatives followed suit. President Obama\u2019s decision to make the mandate a pillar of the ACA ignited broad conservative antipathy to the idea, which left Butler, its progenitor, awkwardly situated when Heritage became the locus of opposition. His decision last July to leave Heritage after 35 years and move to Brookings is a gauge of how far Republican health-care policy has moved to the right since the Clinton era.\n\nWatch our live coverage at BloombergPolitics.com.\n\nPractically alone among Republicans, Butler is sounding an alarm about what a decision in favor of the King plaintiffs would carry with it. While Democrats would be dismayed if the court guts Obama\u2019s signature initiative, Butler\u2019s worry is grounded in an understanding that voters with skyrocketing premiums may not blame Obama, as Republicans assume. They\u2019ll expect the party hellbent on destroying the law to have a solution\u2014and react badly if none is forthcoming. Because 16 states operate their own exchanges and therefore won\u2019t be affected by the court\u2019s ruling, Butler believes the ACA will stagger on and eventually recover, since voters won\u2019t abide a system wherein some states have affordable, federally subsidized health-care coverage and others do not. Absent an alternative, he says, the ACA will rise again like a horror-movie killer. \u201cPeople who believe the ACA instantly goes away are deluding themselves,\u201d he says. \u201cBy not doing anything to develop a Republican vision of how to move forward, they could end up with the very nightmare they\u2019re trying to avoid.\u201d\n\nOn the political front, lawmakers would have to decide what to do about the people in 34 states who would lose their subsidies. In theory, Congress could tweak the law to restore them. But Republicans have no interest in this, nor have they shown any sign of being able to agree on any other fix, much less one that Obama would support. That would throw responsibility to the states, which would each have to try and devise their own solution. Some would probably manage; others, especially those with Republican governors or legislatures implacably opposed to the ACA, almost certainly would not.\n\nThe result would not just leave millions uncovered but also risk destroying the individual health-care markets in states that don\u2019t act. According to a brief filed by a consortium of hospital trade groups, \u201cA market without subsidies will trigger a premium \u2018death spiral\u2019 in those states: With subsidies gone and premiums pushed higher, younger and healthier patients will likely drop coverage. Those that remain, paying the higher rates, are likely to be sicker and use more health-care resources. That, in turn, will push rates for everyone in those states even higher, which will cause more to drop coverage, and so on.\u201d\n\nOn the business front, the effects would be no less significant. \u201cIf the U.S. health-care system were its own economy,\u201d says Butler, \u201cit would be the sixth-largest in the world\u2014larger than Britain\u2019s.\u201d Entire segments of the health system redesigned their business models to take advantage of the ACA\u2019s incentives. Hospitals, for instance, were given a trade-off: They stopped receiving government payments to offset the cost of treating the uninsured, cuts that amount to $269 billion over a decade. In return, they were promised millions of new patients insured through federal subsidies. \u201cAll the major hospital systems and big insurers like Kaiser and Geisinger spent a ton of money adapting to the ACA,\u201d says Butler. If subsidies vanish, \u201csuddenly the market is misaligned. If you\u2019ve hired all these new doctors and health-care workers to cover all these new people walking in the door, and they don\u2019t come, what do you do? You lay them off.\u201d\n\nThis is no mere hypothetical. In 2012, after the ACA had ended hospital reimbursement payments, the Supreme Court ruled that state Medicaid expansion was optional, rather than mandatory, as the law had decreed. Hospitals in the states that chose not to expand Medicaid lost one source of income without gaining a new one to offset it (Medicaid patients). At least 43 hospitals have closed as a result, with the pace picking up each year, according to an investigation by USA Today.\n\nThe ACA also opened up a flood of investments in digital health ventures. A recent study by StartUp Health, a New York incubator, found that $14.5 billion has been invested since the law was signed, including $6.5 billion last year. \u201cIf Congress is unwilling to take action, it would clearly make it less attractive to invest in things related to the coverage expansion,\u201d says Bob Kocher, a partner specializing in health-care IT at the venture capital firm Venrock. \u201cIt slows the rate of change in the health-care ecosystem in a way that\u2019s bad for everybody and hurts companies going after these new patients, who are going to suffer.\u201d\n\nIf the court strikes down federal subsidies, Butler hopes Congress will use the resulting pressure from voters and health-care companies to implement a more conservative vision of health-care reform\u2014changing the tax treatment for employer-sponsored health plans and allowing states much greater flexibility to spend Medicaid money and design their own systems (abolishing the individual mandate if they wish).\n\nBut Butler\u2019s plan would require a Republican contingent willing to go along\u2014and so far none has materialized. \u201cWhen Clinton came in, there was clear momentum toward a sweeping reform of the health system,\u201d he says. \u201cThere was a big debate on the right about whether to try and match it, but with a different structure, or just to attack.\u201d Butler sided with those who wanted to fix the problem. That\u2019s much harder now. \u201cToday, I think we\u2019re in the exact same situation,\u201d he says. \u201cOnly this time there isn\u2019t a core group of people who have coalesced around a basic alternative.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s possible such a group will emerge as the court prepares to issue a decision, probably in late June. The party\u2019s presidential aspirants may also take an interest in Butler\u2019s alternative, given the failure of efforts to repeal the law. \u201cYou can bang your head against the wall all you like,\u201d says Butler. \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t fall down, then maybe you should go around it or figure out some other way to move forward.\u201d So far, though, no one has called. But if the court sides with the King plaintiffs and the blowback is as intense as some people expect\u2014well, maybe then Butler\u2019s phone will start ringing.\n\nAlso on Bloomberg Politics: Will the Conservative Obamacare Creation Story Backfire?", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Joshua Green", "description": "The immediate effect of a ruling against the ACA would be to hurl the political system, and no small part of the economy, into chaos.", "parsely-section": "politics", "parsely-image-url": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/i7uokd267YmU/v2/-1x-1.jpg", "og": {"site_name": "Bloomberg.com/politics", "description": "The immediate effect of a ruling against the ACA would be to hurl the political system, and no small part of the economy, into chaos.", "title": "Is Washington Ready for the\u00a0Death of Obamacare?", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-02-26/the-return-of-the-death-of-obamacare-i6m1baro", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/i7uokd267YmU/v2/-1x-1.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"description": "The immediate effect of a ruling against the ACA would be to hurl the political system, and no small part of the economy, into chaos.", "title": "Is Washington Ready for the\u00a0Death of Obamacare?", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-02-26/the-return-of-the-death-of-obamacare-i6m1baro", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/i7uokd267YmU/v2/-1x-1.jpg", "site": "@bpolitics", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"status": "The immediate effect of a ruling against the ACA would be to hurl the political system, and no small part of the economy, into chaos."}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "parsely-title": "Is Washington Ready for the\u00a0Death of Obamacare?", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "parsely-post-id": "NKDKZW6KLVR801", "parsely-author": "Joshua Green", "date": "2015-02-26T10:55:08.971Z", "keywords": "Consequences", "parsely-type": "post", "news_keywords": "Consequences", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-02-26T10:55:08.971Z", "parsely-tags": "Consequences,Region: Global,Page: article", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "parsely-link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-02-26/the-return-of-the-death-of-obamacare-i6m1baro"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWhen Clinton came in, there was clear momentum toward a sweeping reform of the health system,\u201d he says.\nIn return, they were promised millions of new patients insured through federal subsidies.\nDemocrats won\u2019t talk about what they would do because they don\u2019t want the court to believe they could contain the fallout.\n\u201cAll the major hospital systems and big insurers like Kaiser and Geisinger spent a ton of money adapting to the ACA,\u201d says Butler.\nAlso on Bloomberg Politics: Will the Conservative Obamacare Creation Story Backfire?"}
