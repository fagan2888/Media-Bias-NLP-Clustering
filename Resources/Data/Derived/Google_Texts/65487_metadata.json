So-called \"young invincibles\" are generally healthier and have lower health care costs, so they offset the higher costs of adding older, less healthy folks to the marketplace.\n\nThough reports of a pending ObamaCare death spiral \u2014 in which not enough young people sign up and cause the market to implode \u2014 appear to have been greatly exaggerated, ObamaCare supporters at the state and federal level are making a concerted push to attract this crucial demographic.\n\nSo how do you market ObamaCare to millennials? Here are 11 attempts:\n\nCool celebrities\n\nCalifornia is using famous people \u2014Amy Poehler, Pharrell Williams, Lady Gaga, and Olivia Wilde, among many others \u2014 to pitch ObamaCare in an extensive ad campaign called \"Tell a friend \u2014 Get covered.\" In one spot, an Obama stand-in impersonates Snoop Lion, n\u00e9e Dogg, with a health care-themed \"Drop it Like It's Hot\" parody. The song is, as you'd expect, kind of corny. (\"Your options are really wide \u2014 sprizzead.\") But hey, points for effort.\n\nOther campaign videos include Obama \"singing\" Lady Gaga, a fake Parkour contest, and a Scandal parody featuring Jennifer Hudson.\n\nCool workout gurus\n\nThis one also comes from the above campaign, but is worth singling out. It features fitness guy Richard Simmons \u2014 whose fro makes him something of a proto-hipster \u2014 participating in a dance-off while an MC peppers the action with slogans like \"get covered \u2014 hashtag get covered.\" The campaign \"feature[s] content that resonates among millennials and that can be spread by millennials to their friends and loved ones,\" said Covered California Director Peter Lee.\n\nCool shoes\n\nObamaCare supporters in Washington, D.C., took their message to the streets long line outside a couple of Footlocker stores in December. The reason? Nike's Air Jordan 12 \"Taxi\" sneakers were going on sale, which meant unsuspecting customers waiting in line had a little time to talk about health care. \"My motto is 'Get them health care while you get them Jordans,'\" a DC Health Links representative told Fox News.\n\nCool diners\n\nDC Health Links members also stopped by a local Denny's between the hours of 2:00 a.m. and 4:00 a.m. because, they said, that's \"where the young people visit after a night out.\"\n\nCool provincial folklore\n\n\"Minnesota: land of 10,000 reasons to get health insurance,\" goes a tagline for MNSure, the North Star state's exchange program. Minnesota is spending $9 million on an ad campaign centered around local legend Paul Bunyan, who can be seen ice fishing, water skiing, and visiting a perplexed doctor.\n\nCool music festivals\n\nConnecticut's Access Health CT is planning to sponsor some summer concerts \u2014 Robin Thicke, Fallout Boy \u2014 and to give away tickets to events like Disney on Ice. Meanwhile, Washington Healthplanfinder is sponsoring the big Sasquatch music festival, right alongside more fest-centric companies like Red Bull and Bud Light. That makes sense: if you're going to chug a ton of energy drinks and cheap booze, you should probably be prepared to receive imminent medical attention.\n\nCool keg stands\n\nTurning \"super sick\" into a pun, Colorado's ObamaCare officials released some ads targeting college bros. The \"brosurance\" ads \u2014 part of a larger \"Got Insurance?\" campaign \u2014 featured stock photo dudes doing all sorts of stereotypical dude stuff: yelling, drinking, sporting backwards hats, drinking more, and so on.\n\nCool PJs\n\nRemember Pajama Boy? He was part of the Obama administration's early effort to get people signed up before last year's late-December deadline for obtaining coverage that kicked in Jan. 1.\n\nHow do you plan to spend the cold days of December? http://t.co/Rwf5AYc3bG #GetTalking pic.twitter.com/PBQ397yLf4 \u2014 Barack Obama (@BarackObama) December 17, 2013\n\nPajama Boy is most remembered, though, for all the backlash he inspired among those on the right who thought he was emblematic of wussy, entitled Obama voters. PJ Boy was an \"insufferable man-child,\" wrote National Review's Rich Lowry, who was \"probably reading The Bell Jar and looking forward to a hearty Christmas meal of stuffed tofurkey.\"\n\nCool twee Americana\n\nOregon, of course, launched a \"Long Live Oregon\" campaign with ads that resemble Portlandia sketches. Yet when Oregon's insurance marketplace failed miserably out of the gate, the state scrapped the ads.\n\nCool sports stars\n\nThough the NBA and NFL declined a White House invite to help sell ObamaCare to fans, individual players and teams have taken up the call. The Baltimore Ravens, for one, are marketing Maryland's state-run marketplace. And at the administration's urging, some players tweeted boilerplate messages of support during the Super Bowl, too.\n\nGetting ready for Super Bowl XLVIII\u2026 Football fans don't forget you can affordable healthcare at http://t.co/nS6HeQL927 #getcovered. \u2014 Brendon Ayanbadejo (@brendon310) February 2, 2014 Football fans, hope you're getting ready for Super Bowl XLVIII, don't forget you can #getcovered at http://t.co/sdKs8KPH1E #RockEnroll \u2014 Donte' Stallworth (@DonteStallworth) February 2, 2014\n\nCool sports legends\n\nNot content with current athletes, the White House also enlisted hoops icons Magic Johnson and Alonzo Mourning in a new ad campaign. These ads may actually be the most effective of the bunch. Mourning talks about how he felt \"invincible\" until a routine physical revealed a kidney disease. And though Johnson doesn't talk specifically about HIV, his health history is so well-known it can't be lost on viewers.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Official site of The Week Magazine, offering commentary and analysis of the day's breaking news and current events as well as arts, entertainment, people and gossip, and political cartoons.", "og": {"url": "http://theweek.com/articles/451668/11-ways-obamacare-being-marketed-millennials", "image": "http://api.theweek.com/sites/default/files/styles/tw_image_9_4/public/56976_article_full.jpg?itok=RSDMHv90", "type": "article", "description": "Putting the \"hip\" in \"hip replacement surgery\"", "title": "11 ways ObamaCare is being marketed to millennials"}, "twitter": {"description": "Putting the \"hip\" in \"hip replacement surgery\"", "creator": "@jonterbush", "image": {"src": "http://api.theweek.com/sites/default/files/styles/tw_image_9_4/public/56976_article_full.jpg?itok=RSDMHv90"}, "title": "11 ways ObamaCare is being marketed to millennials", "site": "@theweek", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 10716057521}, "keywords": "feature, Politics", "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-04T12:36:00-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcec0c\"", "article_summary": "\"My motto is 'Get them health care while you get them Jordans,'\" a DC Health Links representative told Fox News.\nADVERTISEMENTIn order to work properly, ObamaCare's health care exchanges need to enroll a large percentage of younger Americans.\nNike's Air Jordan 12 \"Taxi\" sneakers were going on sale, which meant unsuspecting customers waiting in line had a little time to talk about health care.\nSo-called \"young invincibles\" are generally healthier and have lower health care costs, so they offset the higher costs of adding older, less healthy folks to the marketplace.\nCool keg standsTurning \"super sick\" into a pun, Colorado's ObamaCare officials released some ads targeting college bros."}
