Ted Cruz (R-Texas) focused on national security, private sector job growth and freedom at his rally at the The Armory in Janesville on March 24.\n\nThe venue was full of people standing by the time the rally started around 5:10 p.m.\n\nEast Troy High School senior Josiah Lang attended the rally, as he said he plans to vote for the first time in the November presidential election.\n\nHe finds himself agreeing with many of the platforms Cruz has built his campaign on.\n\n\u201cIf Cruz gets elected, it\u2019s going to be a game-changer for America and our future,\u201d Lang said.\n\nCruz addressed the ideas that college students are graduating from college with thousands of dollars of debt with no jobs to go to, repealing \u201cevery word\u201d of the Affordable Care Act (ACA).\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re here because our country is in crisis,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cWe\u2019re bankrupting our kids and grandkids because our constitutional rights are under assault each and every day. Because America has receded from leadership in the world, it\u2019s made the world a much more dangerous place.\u201d\n\nHe condemned President Barack Obama\u2019s reaction to acts of terrorism, most recently this week following the attacks in Brussels, Belgium, saying political correctness was limiting the work done by the U.S. Military.\n\nCruz said the military has had their \u201chands tied behind their backs\u201d during the Obama administration due to political correctness.\n\nHe says it\u2019s \u201cimmoral.\u201d\n\n\u201cOver the past seven years, we\u2019ve had an administration that abandons our friends and allies, and shows weakness and appeasement to our enemies,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cNo longer will our military be governed by political correctness.\n\n\u201cIn the wake of these terrorist attacks, whether it be Paris, whether it\u2019s San Bernardino, whether it\u2019s Brussels, we have a president in President Obama who goes on television and refuses to even say the words \u2018radical Islamic terrorism,\u2019\u201d Cruz added. \u201cInstead, he lectures Americans on Islamophobia. Enough is enough.\u201d\n\nCruz said if was sworn in as president in January 2017, he\u2019d send the military to kill all \u201cjihadists.\u201d\n\nObama addressed the American people from Cuba on Tuesday following the ISIS attacks in Brussels, Belgium while giving a speech about the relations between the U.S. and Cuba.\n\n\u201cThis is yet another reminder that the world must unite,\u201d Obama said. \u201cWe must be together regardless of nationality, or race, or faith in fighting against the scourge of terrorism. We can and we will defeat those who threaten the security of people all around the world.\u201d\n\nCruz spoke to the single mothers \u201cwho are working two or three part-time jobs\u201d who have seen their hours reduced due to ACA regulations that kick in when an employee reaches 30 hours a week.\n\n\u201cThe wages stay stagnant year after year,\u201d he said. \u201cCost of living keeps going up, but somehow your paycheck doesn\u2019t seem to keep pace.\u201d\n\nCruz said job growth can be achieved by taking the \u201cboot of the government off the backs of small businesses,\u201d a phenomenon he claims America has seen the past seven years. Cruz\u2019s words come as a contradiction to a growth of 8.7 million jobs as of October 2015 under the Obama administration, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nHe also proposed rewriting the tax code to create a flat tax in order for Americans to fill out their taxes on a postcard-style form while abolishing the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).\n\nTransitioning into his next theme of freedom, Cruz referenced the death of U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, saying America is \u201cone liberal Justice away\u201d from the Supreme Court stripping away religious liberties, erasing the Second Amendment protecting gun rights and bringing the country under the authority of the World Court and the United Nations.\n\nCruz then accused GOP frontrunner Donald Trump of being willing to compromise with Democrats when it came down to religious liberties.\n\nGetting personal\n\nCruz also took the time to deliver a few personal blows to Trump, especially when it came down to comments about his wife Heidi.\n\nTrump\u2019s wife Melania was the center of an ad campaign where naked photos from a 2000 \u201cGQ Magazine\u201d photoshoot were used to advocate for voters to choose Cruz over Trump, because of how each of the potential First Ladies have represented themselves.\n\nThe ad was not created or endorsed by Ted Cruz, but instead by the anti-Trump political action committee (PAC) \u201cMake America Awesome.\u201d\n\nTrump tweeted about the ad and personally accused Cruz for being the mastermind behind it.\n\n\u201cLyin\u2019 Ted Cruz just used a picture of Melania from a G.Q. shoot in his ad,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cBe careful, Lyin\u2019 Ted, or I will spill the beans on your wife!\u201d\n\nCruz responded by calling Trump a \u201csniveling coward\u201d while on the campaign trail in Wisconsin.\n\nCruz made mention of his polling numbers in Wisconsin, and his one point lead over the real estate mogul.\n\nHe says there\u2019s more at stake than just an election with a Trump candidacy \u2013 a Supreme Court nominee and the Bill of Rights hang in the balance, Cruz said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy to talk about making America great again \u2013 you can even print that on baseball caps,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s another thing to understand the principles and values that made America great in the first place.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Royal Purple News", "description": "By Kimberly Wethal March 24, 2016 Presidential candidate Sen.
