Until recently, Lt. Gov. Anthony Brown wanted you to believe he was the man.\n\nFor years, he\u2019s been describing himself as Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley\u2019s \"point man\" on this crucial health insurance program. The governor\u2019s press staff dutifully gives Brown co-authorship and quotable lines every time there's a press release.\n\nYet it has become painfully clear Brown is not the \u201cpoint man\u201d on Obamacare, Maryland-style.\n\nWhat Webster Says\n\nBy every dictionary definition, Brown fails that test.\n\nPoint man: \u201ca person in the forefront of an economic or political issue\u201d (Webster\u2019s College Dictionary).\n\nNot so. Brown is in his usual position \u2013 in the background as the governor\u2019s second banana. At media events, he talks only when the governor directs him to do so.\n\nPoint man: \u201cA man who has a crucial, often hazardous role in the forefront of an enterprise\u201d (American Heritage Dictionary).\n\nThis doesn\u2019t describe Brown\u2019s role, either. His healthcare designation is symbolic, not substantive.\n\nHe co-chairs an oversight panel on healthcare reforms but it is Maryland\u2019s health secretary, not Brown, who\u2019s done the crucial, heavy lifting and taken the brunt of criticisms from legislators.\n\nPoint man: \u201cthe leader or spokesperson of a campaign or organization\u201d (Collins English Dictionary).\n\nBrown is neither leading the pack on Obamacare nor acting as spokesman for the computerized rollout \u2013 except when the governor is out of the country.\n\nO'Malley Takes the Lead\n\nMore often than not Brown has had little to add to what more informed officials have to say about this terribly botched IT programming that continues to plague Obamacare in Maryland.\n\nHe's avoided tough-questioning reporters and responded only in a few choreographed situations.\n\nOnce the governor returned this month from his business development trip to Latin America, he stepped forward to answer the difficult questions about the healthcare insurance rollout. Brown once again was relegated to a cheerleading role:\n\nO\u2019Malley is the one who ordered emergency IT fixes by mid-December.\n\nO\u2019Malley is the one who turned day-to-day authority for the exchange over to his top healthcare adviser.\n\nO\u2019Malley is the one who dispatched his information technology guru to figure out how to fix this deeply flawed project.\n\nO\u2019Malley is the one who announced hiring a Columbia-based computer management company to end this software nightmare.\n\nO'Malley is the one holding a flurry of media events to discuss the rollout, both pro and con.\n\nOther than comments to back up the governor\u2019s remarks, Brown has contributed little to the discussion.\n\nDeath-watch job\n\nNone of this is surprising.\n\nLieutenant governors in Maryland are pitifully neutered. They hold office for a single constitutional purpose \u2013 to replace the governor if the state\u2019s leader dies or is incapacitated.\n\nBrown has spent the vast majority of the past seven years in campaign mode, delivering prepared speeches at every conceivable event around the state.\n\nHe\u2019s not deeply involved in policy decisions \u2013 no lieutenant governor is. The governor\u2019s tight-knit inner circle of aides and advisors makes sure of it.\n\nHow Brown explains all this to voters is his biggest problem now that his lack of real responsibility has been laid bare.\n\nEvaluating Anthony Brown\n\nThe lieutenant governor may be O\u2019Malley\u2019s heir apparent, but does this heir deserve that title?\n\nHis track record is slim. Until the botched healthcare rollout put Brown in an embarrassing spotlight, he was an unknown to most voters.\n\nHis future depends in large measure on O\u2019Malley\u2019s ability to find a way out of this healthcare debacle.\n\nIf enough IT patches make the Maryland Health Connection reliable and usable for both applicants and insurers, public ire may die down by the June 24 primary \u2013 D-Day for Brown.\n\nBut if computer glitches and foul-ups persist and tens of thousands of Marylanders are denied enrollment, if the state can\u2019t provide insurers with accurate customer data and if public fury increases by early summer, Brown\u2019s chances of winning could tumble.\n\nThe Obamacare debacle in Maryland has exposed Brown\u2019s vulnerabilities. It could mark an inflection point in the nascent 2014 gubernatorial campaign.\n\nYou can read all of Barry Rascovar\u2019s columns at politicalmaryland.com.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Who\u2019s in charge of Maryland\u2019s computerized Obamacare rollout?
