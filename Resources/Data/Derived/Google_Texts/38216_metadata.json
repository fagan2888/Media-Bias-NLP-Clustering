The problem started not long after she married her husband, Louis, in May of 2014, \u201cwe were sitting in the kitchen and he had brought home all of his insurance information to show me,\u201d she said.\n\nHis employer offered family health benefits. When they started looking at the prices they realized it just wasn\u2019t affordable.\n\nPoulin used to pay $50 a month for a subsidized plan through Obamacare. Now she was looking at about $500 a month. Poulin married in to what\u2019s known as the family glitch. When she got married, she lost her subsidy.\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, if one person in a family has a job that offers health insurance to the rest of the family, nobody can get subsidies on the federally-run exchanges. Yes, her husband\u2019s job did offer her health insurance, but at about 10 times more than she was paying with subsidies.\n\nOn the exchange, almost everyone who buys insurance gets tax breaks to make it more affordable. Poulin works for just above minimum wage at a Fort Myers coffee shop that doesn\u2019t offer insurance. Her family income is less than $53,000 a year.\n\nEven though she has a chronic sleep disorder and needs to see a doctor every three months, she decided not to buy insurance. \u201cIt has you know, kind of scared me that something bad could happen,\u201d said Poulen.\n\nNobody\u2019s counting exactly how many people are going without insurance because they\u2019re in this family glitch. But a recent study from the Kaiser Family Foundation estimates that more than 400,000 Floridians went without health coverage\u2014even when they could have gotten it through work.\n\nAnd when people find out they don\u2019t qualify for those marketplace tax breaks, people get upset, said Greg Jenkins. For the past three years, Jenkins has helped people sign up for Obamacare. He\u2019s a navigator with the Epilepsy Foundation of Florida in Miami. He has seen a lot of people in the family glitch.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re upset with\u2014let\u2019s call the affordable care act Obamacare\u2014and they\u2019re upset with their employer,\u201d said Jenkins. \u201cThe option is suck it up and cover the spouse and dependents and pay the full freight or no coverage at all.\u201d\n\nJenkins tries to point adults in this situation towards charity programs. And for their children, Florida Kidcare is a government subsidized insurance option. That\u2019s what Sherry Poulin did. She put her 4-year-old daughter, Story, on Kidcare. For herself, she pays out of pocket to see her doctor. For her sleep disorder, she takes half the prescribed medication.\n\nPoulin\u2019s mom, Laura Brennaman, didn\u2019t know her daughter was trying to stretch out her medication. She\u2019s a former emergency room nurse. Now she\u2019s the policy director for Florida CHAIN\u2013the group advocates for affordable health care and for fixing the family glitch. Brennaman wants employers to understand how offering high-cost insurance sometimes leaves people in a worse position than if they offered nothing at all to families.\n\nSteven Ullmann directs the Center for Health Sector Management and Policy at the University of Miami. \u201cSo you have a family that is caught between the rock and the hard place,\u201d he said.\n\nBig employers have to offer \u201caffordable\u201d health insurance options employees to avoid federal tax penalties. But the rules aren\u2019t the same for family members.\n\nUllmann said as health insurance costs keep rising, the family benefit is one of the few places employers can legally shift costs without getting fined under the Affordable Care Act. \u201cNot affordable through the employer, not affordable through the exchanges, through the federal subsidies,\u201d said Ullmann. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the glitch.\u201d\n\nFor Sherry Poulin, that glitch doesn\u2019t just mean going without insurance and taking half of her medication. It means she doesn\u2019t run around and play with her daughter the way she used to. \u201cI\u2019m just too tired for that. It sucks. It makes me feel like a crappy mom,\u201d Poulin said. Which is part of why she\u2019s trying again to find health insurance\u2014even without the subsidies.\n\nOpen enrollment overlaps with the holiday season and her mom, said her gift this year is going to be help paying for health insurance.\n\nWMFE is a partner with Health News Florida, which receives support from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.\n\nHealth reporting on WMFE is supported in part by Florida Hospital and the Winter Park Health Foundation.", "article_metadata": {"description": "What Happens When Marriage Makes Health Insurance Unaffordable", "generator": "MasterSlider 2.7.1 - Responsive Touch Image Slider | www.avt.li/msf", "title": "What Happens When Marriage Makes Health Insurance Unaffordable - 90.7 WMFE", "og": {"site_name": "90.7 WMFE", "description": "It\u2019s open enrollment season for health insurance through the Affordable Care Act.
