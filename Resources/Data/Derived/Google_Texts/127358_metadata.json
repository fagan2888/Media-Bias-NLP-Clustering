The Santa Monica City Council is considering a big hike in the minimum wage, from California\u2019s $9-an-hour to $15.37-an-hour or more, and that could have a big impact on the bottom line, according to general manager Megan Heritage. \u201cWe can absorb the first year or two,\u201d she said. \u201cBut by the third year,\u201d she added, the result would be less certain. Laconda del Lago isn\u2019t the only Santa Monica establishment bracing for the looming wage hike. Recently, some 20 local restaurateurs met to decide how to cope with the proposed higher wage the Council is expected to take up in September, Heritage said. All present were highly concerned, \u201cespecially small independent restaurants without a corporation to rely on,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need to employ strategies to stay in business.\u201d Some restaurant owners are contemplating adding a service charge to the final check -- as is done in Europe -- instead of relying on tips, a practice that would help offset the higher wages, Heritage said. The check would look bigger, but could actually be less or roughly the same than if a tip were included, she added. The higher minimum wage comes as many California businesses contend with a requirement that they offer health insurance under the Affordable Care Act and a State law that requires three days paid sick leave, Heritage noted. The city\u2019s Chamber of Commerce has not yet taken a position on the proposed wage hike, said Carl Hansen, director of governmental affairs. But he said the chamber realizes that the issue is \u201ccomplicated\u201d and that both the welfare of employers and employees needs to be taken into consideration. \u201cIt\u2019s a delicate balance,\u201d he said. If the wage hike is approved, Santa Monica would be following closely in the footsteps of the City of Los Angeles, which is raising its minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2020. Seattle and San Francisco previously passed measures to hike wages to $15-an-hour over the next several years, as well. And the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors is having the same discussion for the region\u2019s unincorporated areas. That is also true of West Hollywood. The proposed Santa Monica ordinance would likely expand the $15.37-an-hour paid to Santa Monica City workers, those employed by City contractors and a few others under the City\u2019s existing \u201cliving wage\u201d ordinance. Supporters argue that low wage workers can\u2019t afford decent housing and other basic necessities in an increasingly expensive region. Critics counter that the higher minimum can drive businesses to shut down and won\u2019t help workers earn enough to afford living in an expensive city like Santa Monica. Councilmember Sue Himmelrich has little sympathy for the claim that raising the minimum wage would prove too expensive for local businesses. \u201cI am not worried,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve never been in a Santa Monica restaurant that didn\u2019t have enough customers. I\u2019ve been in restaurants where the lines are out the door. If you can\u2019t make a profit, you\u2019re doing something wrong. \u201cWill (restaurateurs) make a less money? Possibly. But will the people who work for them be living demonstratively better? Absolutely.\u201d Workers, she said, deserve \u201cto be paid a living wage.\u201d The higher minimum wage could have a far-reaching impact on Santa Monica businesses and their workers. Tourism alone is linked to an estimated 13,700 jobs and much of that industry relies on low-wage help. Paying a higher minimum wage is an added cost small businesses cannot afford, Heritage said. It means the entry level employees, like dishwashers, who now make the minimum would get hefty raises. But the financial impact on other employees, like waiters \u2013 who can make $60,000 when tips are included -- is less certain, she said. Servers at high-end restaurants are hired for their experience and expertise, and that brings both better basic pay and big tips. Such employees might see a pay cut to offset the higher minimum wage given to entry-level employees, Heritage worried. For more than a decade, setting a living wage have been a contentious issue in Santa Monica. In 2002, the beachside city made headlines when voters narrowly rejected a pioneering law that would have required businesses in the Coastal zone -- mainly hotels and restaurants -- to pay workers a minimum wage. Over the past three years, the City Council has required that new hotels pay workers a minimum wage as part of their development agreements. The City must be mindful of its past struggles with instituting a living wage and work with the business community on its current effort, said Mayor Kevin McKeown. McKeown said he has been careful \u201cto make sure that our next step is conversation\u201d and noted that he made immediate contact with the city\u2019s Chamber when talk of the raising the minimum wage began. \u201cI think all of us in Santa Monica realize that higher minimum wages are coming, and can be administered to make them just and fair,\u201d McKeown said. The City will hold a number of community workshops over the summer on the proposed ordinance, City officials said.", "article_metadata": {}, "article_summary": "Absolutely.\u201d Workers, she said, deserve \u201cto be paid a living wage.\u201d The higher minimum wage could have a far-reaching impact on Santa Monica businesses and their workers.\nThe proposed Santa Monica ordinance would likely expand the $15.37-an-hour paid to Santa Monica City workers, those employed by City contractors and a few others under the City\u2019s existing \u201cliving wage\u201d ordinance.\nLaconda del Lago isn\u2019t the only Santa Monica establishment bracing for the looming wage hike.\nBy Niki CervantesStaff Writer -- At Locanda Del Lago restaurant on the Promenade in Santa Monica, managemnet is increasingly anxious.\nFor more than a decade, setting a living wage have been a contentious issue in Santa Monica."}
