Like all of you, I was disappointed and sad for what this means for our community. But when I heard some Latino activists telling my Hispanic community not to vote, I was disgusted and have one thing to say to them. Shame on you!\n\nTo say that our collective frustration should lead to apathy and less political participation rather than call for more political empowerment for our people and get them to the polls, is the most irresponsible call to action I have ever heard from a Latino activist.\n\nAnd they need to stop now.\n\nI know we\u2019re devastated and pissed off, and I know we\u2019ve waited for a long time for action, but not voting is not the solution. No matter how upset we are or what the circumstances are, we should never tell our community that staying home on Election Day is the solution. It is incredibly cynical, counterproductive and only leads to perpetuating a lack of political power built through political participation. It is political mal-practice.\n\nLatinos are a big demographic in the United States, and our community continues to grow. According to the U.S. Census, in 2011 there were approximately 52 million Latinos living in the United States. And today, approximately 800,000 Latinos turn 18 every year. But these numbers don\u2019t turn into political power by themselves overnight, it requires constant political participation and mobilization.\n\nUnfortunately, we Latinos have a big problem that\u2019s called apathy. Instead of transforming our frustration into electoral power and making our voices heard, we decide to stay home on Election Day - giving the impression that anyone can take us for granted because we won\u2019t do anything about it. It\u2019s that same political apathy that makes politicians \u2013 in both parties - believe that they can ignore us and ignore the needs and well-being of our community.\n\nVoting is our voice. As we celebrate Hispanic Heritage Month in September and October, what better way to honor our legacy than to work towards better political empowerment to ensure Latinos will be taken seriously. - Maria Cardona\n\nThis is why the Republican Party continues refusing to give us a vote on immigration reform in the House of Representatives. Because Republicans believe based on historical evidence that Latinos won\u2019t vote in the midterm elections in large numbers, and therefore won\u2019t hold them accountable or affect the composition of Congress for the next two years. They believe that since Latinos won\u2019t come out to vote this November that they can afford to ignore us without risk.\n\nLatinos are trapped in a vicious circle and by not voting we only boycott our community\u2019s bargaining power and ourselves.\n\nIn 2010, according to the Pew Hispanic Center, only 31.2% of Latino eligible voters went out to vote. And in 2012, 48% of Latino eligible voters or 11.2 million Latinos went out to vote. But 12.1 million stayed home. If those 12 million had voted, what a great difference we would have made.\n\nThe elections in November have serious repercussions \u2013 whoever wins in each race will help define the issues that Congress deals with and that state legislatures across the country deal with, and which they don\u2019t give the time of day. Latinos can\u2019t wait any longer.\n\nIn fact, if all Latinos who were eligible to register to vote did so, and then all Latino voters came out to vote, Latinos could flip the House of Representatives. Period. There are enough eligible Latinos in swing districts and in districts that Obama won in 2012 or lost by less than 2 points, that if they all showed up to vote, the House could be up for grabs.\n\nDo you think Republicans would have dared not bring up immigration reform if Latinos showed this kind of political power? Not by a long shot.\n\nThis November our choice is clear \u2013 between Democratic candidates who have fought for immigration reform, want to increase the minimum wage so that no one who works full time has to suffer to take care of their family, and want to continue to give 10 million Latinos affordable health care under the Affordable Care Act, and Republican candidates who voted to shut down the government, waste our money by frivolously suing the President, want to take away our health care and continue voting against our community every chance they get.\n\nRepublicans did vote on one immigration bill before they left for recess: they voted to gut the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) and deport all the DREAMers. And now some are even threatening to shut down the government again to make sure the President can\u2019t fulfill his promise of relief from deportation for a larger number of people in our community.\n\nWe can\u2019t afford to wait any longer for immigration reform, or for equal pay, or a higher minimum wage, or for access to affordable higher education for our children. We want our children to have access to higher education without having to worry about how they\u2019re going to pay these outrageously high student loans. The American Dream should not be mortgaged on an unpayable student loan.\n\nThe stakes are as high this November as they are in Presidential elections.\n\nThis November remember to fight against the temptation to stay home and remember that we\u2019ve never solved more problems with less participation and less democracy. When less people vote, Republicans win. And when Republicans win, our community loses.\n\nVoting is our voice. As we celebrate Hispanic Heritage Month in September and October, what better way to honor our legacy than to work towards better political empowerment to ensure Latinos will be taken seriously. Don\u2019t let frustration turn into weakness. Instead turn it into political bargaining power so that politicians can never again turn their backs on us for so long, and get away with it. So amigos, se puede? S\u00ed. But it\u2019s up to us.\n\nMaria Cardona is a Democratic strategist, Principal at the Dewey Square Group and Founder of Latinovations.\n\nFollow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatino\n\nLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino", "article_metadata": {"classification": "POLITICS/Elections, POLITICS/Immigration", "dcterms.modified": "2014-09-16 10:46:27 EDT", "dc.type": "Text.Article", "twitter": {"image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/global.fncstatic.com/static/managed/img/fn2/video/0/0/090614_ANHQ_Immigration_640.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "site": "@foxnewslatino", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@foxnewslatino"}, "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.publisher": "Fox News Latino", "parsely-metadata": "{\"title\":\"Opinion: Encouraging Latinos Not To Vote Over Immigration Impasse Is Irresponsible, Shameful\",\"link\":\"http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/opinion/2014/09/16/opinion-encouraging-latinos-not-to-vote-over-immigration-impasse-is/\",\"image_url\":\"http://a57.foxnews.com/global.fncstatic.com/static/managed/img/fn2/video/0/0/090614_ANHQ_Immigration_640.jpg?ve=1&tl=1\",\"type\":\"article\",\"identifier\":\"65bcb548dce78410VgnVCM100000d7c1a8c0RCRD\",\"section\":\"opinion\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-09-16T14:46:27Z\",\"author\":\"Maria Cardona\",\"tags\":[\"POLITICS/Elections\",\" POLITICS/Immigration\"]}", "prism.aggregationType": "front", "keywords": "Hillary Clinton,United States,immigration reform,Presidential elections,immigration bill,the time,Affordable Care Act,higher education,President Obama,register to vote", "description": "En Alemania, un grupo de investigadores ha batido un nuevo r\u00e9cord mundial en la transmisi\u00f3n inal\u00e1mbrica de datos.
