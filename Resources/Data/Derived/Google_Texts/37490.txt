As the class of 2015 hits the job market this month, prospects for employment are better than they’ve been in years.

Overall hiring has picked up, and employers expect to take on nearly 10 percent more college graduates this year than they did last year, according to the National Association of Colleges and Employers. Those graduates in the most demand hold degrees in engineering, business and computer science.

Even as the country improves overall, some regions are seeing more improved job growth than others, making them a better bet for new grads to enter the working world. WalletHub has ranked the nation’s largest 150 cities from best to worst for starting a career, based on the strength of their job markets, the attractiveness of their social scenes and other factors.

Texas and California dominated the top of the list, with the Lone Star State occupying six of the top 10 states. Irving, Tex., came in first place, followed by Grand Prairie, Tex., and Austin.

Detroit, Mich., brought up the bottom of the list, along with Fresno, Calif., and Toledo, Ohio.

Finding a decent job right away is especially important for 2015 grads, who will start their careers with the most student debt of any class in history. Those with debt will owe about $35,000 when they collect their sheepskins, about $2,000 more per student than the class of 2014.
