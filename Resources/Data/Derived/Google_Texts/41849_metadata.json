In 2012 she put out two more singles \u2014 \u201c9th Inning\u201d and \u201cTriple Threat\u201d \u2014 but still hasn\u2019t given a release date for the album.\n\n\u201cWhen I create something, it\u2019s gotta be special, and it can\u2019t just be to throw something out there because I feel like I\u2019m Missy,\u201d said told Yahoo\u2019s The Yo Show. \u201cI gotta feel like what I\u2019m giving the fans is 100% and that it\u2019s game-changing.

In 2011 she announced to fans that she suffers from Graves disease, an autoimmune disorder that affects the thyroid. Missy said she was diagnosed in 2008 and noted that the ailment is something \u201cyou live with it for the rest of your life.\u201d\n\nAfter announcing that she had been diagnosed, Missy took to Twitter to thank fans for their support:\n\n\u201cThank yall for the love yall have shown me! *TearsofJoy* I love yall so much!\u201d Fans are using the hashtag #prayFOR missy to send well-wishes.\u201d\n\nMissy Elliott assured fans that she is still planning on coming back, but added, \u201cI just ain\u2019t telling nobody when.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Missy Elliott has been gone from the music scene for going on ten years, and while she's still planning a comeback the rapper won't say when it might happen", "og": {"site_name": "The Inquisitr News", "description": "Missy Elliott has been gone from the music scene for going on ten years, and while she\u2019s still planning a comeback the rapper won\u2019t say when it might happen", "title": "Missy Elliott Planning Music Comeback, But Won\u2019t Say When", "url": "http://www.inquisitr.com/1124054/missy-elliott-planning-music-comeback-but-wont-say-when/", "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Missy-Elliott-Comeback.jpg", "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-06T22:33:16+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-02-06T23:17:45+00:00"}, "type": "article"}, "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Missy-Elliott-Comeback.jpg", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ed1c24", "datePublished": "2014-02-06T22:33:16+00:00", "fb": {"app_id": 164157850314499, "pages": 71179904752}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/assets/0cec37/dist/images/logos/inq-win.png", "keywords": "missy elliott,missy elliott album,missy elliott comeback,music", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "y_key": "f282393706a5fd85", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Missy-Elliott-Comeback.jpg", "height": 409, "width": 670}, "site": "@theinquisitr", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Missy Elliott has been gone from the music scene for going on ten years, and while she\u2019s still planning a comeback the rapper won\u2019t say when it might happen"}, "viewport": "width=980"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb249\"", "article_summary": "Missy Elliott has been gone from the music scene for going on ten years, and while she\u2019s still planning a comeback the rapper won\u2019t say when it might happen.\nThe hiatus could be in part to some health issues Missy Elliott has been dealing with.\n*TearsofJoy* I love yall so much!\u201d Fans are using the hashtag #prayFOR missy to send well-wishes.\u201dMissy Elliott assured fans that she is still planning on coming back, but added, \u201cI just ain\u2019t telling nobody when.\u201d\nMissy teased a seventh album, titled Block Party, by releasing a handful of singles in the past few years.\n\u201cWhen I create something, it\u2019s gotta be special, and it can\u2019t just be to throw something out there because I feel like I\u2019m Missy,\u201d said told Yahoo\u2019s The Yo Show."}
