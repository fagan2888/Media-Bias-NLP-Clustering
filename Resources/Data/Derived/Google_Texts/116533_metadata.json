Unfortunately, in its latest earnings report, the results were pretty bad.\n\nRevenues plunged by 57% to $199.8 million, and there was a loss of $214.7 million, or 78 cents per share. The Street, on the other hand, was looking for revenues of $519.3 million and a loss of 11 cents per share.\n\nWhat happened? Well, there was a reasonable explanation: The IRS delayed the time to e-file returns (because of the shutdown of the federal government last year). In other words, a big chunk of the revenues will shift to the next quarter. So there was nothing to panic about.\n\nYet is HRB stock a good buy at current levels? Or should investors wait? To see, let\u2019s take a look at the pros and cons:\n\nHRB Stock Pros\n\nBrand and Scale: H&R Block has 12,000 offices and 80,000 preparers, and it prepares one out of every six tax returns in the U.S. But just a few years ago, H&R Block was struggling. For the most part, the company got sunk in the mortgage mess and neglected its core tax business. The good news is that the company\u2019s new CEO Bill Cobb has pulled off a solid turnaround. He has refurbished the retail locations and added more digital products, such as mobile apps. As a result, HRB stock has doubled since 2012.\n\nCatalysts: Let\u2019s face it, the tax code is not likely to get any easier. That\u2019s certainly good news for HRB stock. For example, Obamacare has added another layer of complexity to filing taxes, which is likely to encourage more people to use services like H&R Block. There is also a deal with online insurance operator GoHealth to allow HRB customers to purchase healthcare policies. But H&R Block also has lots of opportunities in foreign markets. So far, the company has promising footprints in Australia, Canada, India and Brazil.\n\nFinancials. The company\u2019s financials are solid. For the most part, H&R Block has a strong source of recurring revenues. The margins are also juicy. During the last 12 months, EBITDA came to 589.99 million. With the cash, H&R Block has been aggressively buying back HRB stock and paying out dividends (the company has made payments for 206 consecutive quarters). The current yield on HRB stock is a reasonable 2.6%.\n\nHRB Stock Cons\n\nDigital: While H&R Block has a good set of online and mobile products, the fact is that a big chunk of business comes from its retail operation. Over time, this could be threated, as seen with other industries like video rentals. No doubt, H&R Block faces intense competition from top digitial providers, such as Intuit\u2019s (INTU) TurboTax, TaxSlayer.com and Blucora\u2019s (BCOR) TaxAct.\n\nMarket Growth: Last year was particularly tough for the tax preparation business. There were last minute tax changes \u2014 because of the budget showdown on Capitol Hill \u2014 as well as delays in filings. The continued softness in the U.S. economy was an issue as well. But Cobb is expecting improvement in 2014. He\u2019s looking for a 1% growth rate in tax filings. Yet this is still modest growth and means that there might not be much of a surprise factor for the stock.\n\nLiability Exposure: As with other tax preparer firms, H&R Block has been the target of litigation because of its refund anticipation loan program. One court ruling indicated that it should be considered a loan and, as a result, subject to the truth-in-lending laws. H&R Block, of course, believes its products were fine. But it is far from clear what the impact from the litigation will be.\n\nHRB Stock Verdict\n\nH&R Block has posted a nice turnaround. The company is much more focused nowadays and has a better cost structure. It has also taken the tough steps to clean up problems with its mortgage business.\n\nH&R Block has also seen lots of traction with providing add-on products, such as the Emerald Card. There are also opportunities with Obamacare assistance as well as market expansion into other countries.\n\nDespite all those improvements, it could still be tough to continue to grow since the number of filings in the US appears to have stalled. Besides, HRB stock has already factored in much of the benefits from the turnaround.\n\nSo should you buy HRB stock? No \u2014 for now, there don\u2019t appear to be any catalysts to get the shares moving.\n\nTom Taulli runs the InvestorPlace blog IPO Playbook.
