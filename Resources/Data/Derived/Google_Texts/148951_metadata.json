I thought if they don\u2019t want me there, I won\u2019t go.\u201d\n\nHowever, on Friday, he boarded a plane from Chicago to Las Vegas. The flight was a birthday gift from his daughter Jacqueline.\n\nLess than 24 hours after arriving at McCarran International Airport, Scott said he had already gotten a sense of the Las Vegas community and its people.\n\n\u201cLas Vegas has turned out to be greater than I could\u2019ve imagined,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve also come to understand what the slogan, \u2018what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas,\u2019 really means. It doesn\u2019t mean what you think it means. You can\u2019t take all of this back with you, you\u2019d have to come back to get this again.\u201d\n\nLas Vegas was very different 50 years ago. According to a publication from the University of Nevada, Las Vegas William S. Boyd School of Law, a 1960 a meeting between former Mayor Oran Gragson, Hank Greenspun of the Las Vegas Sun and leaders of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People resulted in the integration of the Las Vegas Strip. However, not all of the hotel-casinos were cooperative and much of the 1960s was spent working toward complete integration.\n\nVegas wasn\u2019t the only place Scott had implemented a self-imposed boycott against.\n\n\u201cI had an experience in Mississippi while I was en route from Miami to Fort Riley, Kan. when I was a brand new second lieutenant in the Army,\u201d he said. \u201cI was traveling with my wife and three children and when we reached Mississippi my kids were screaming that they were hungry so I we stopped at a restaurant. When I got to the front door I was told I couldn\u2019t come in that way, I had to go around back and eat.\u201d\n\nScott said he was conflicted about what to do as he was about to go to his first active duty station and defend America, despite not being allowed to eat breakfast at the establishment.\n\n\u201cI went back to the car and told my kids we had to find somewhere else to go but they were so hungry they started wailing so I sucked up my pride and went around back to eat at a picnic table in the kitchen,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was one of the best breakfasts my kids ever had because the kitchen help was so happy to have us there. But I felt a crushing blow inside and I put a boycott on Mississippi.\u201d\n\nThis past April, Scott attended his stepson\u2019s graduation in Mississippi.\n\n\u201cIt feels like I\u2019m taking a big burden off my shoulders,\u201d Scott said of lifting his boycotts. \u201cI had to maneuver to stay out of Vegas and Mississippi. My friends would come to Las Vegas and couldn\u2019t understand why I didn\u2019t want to go. I just told them I couldn\u2019t make the trip.\u201d\n\nScott heads back home on Monday, the day before his 75th birthday. When asked what his plans are while in Las Vegas, Scott\u2019s wife, Beverly, said, \u201cMichael Jackson.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not quite my era,\u201d he replied with a laugh.\n\nScott met Beverly in 1999 while he was the general manager and publisher of The Chicago Defender, an African-American daily newspaper, where she was a reporter. He now serves as the president of Chicago Defender Charities, which gives back to the community through various events and scholarships.\n\nBeverly told the newspaper that her husband would be visiting Las Vegas and felt it was important to tell his story.\n\n\u201cWhen he first told me the story about his Las Vegas experience, in my mind I thought if he ever goes, I\u2019ll make sure it\u2019s a great experience (for him) because it\u2019s a tremendous story,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m serving as a bridge for him of letting go of the past and stepping into the future. I\u2019m privileged to be here to experience the transition and happy to help make it an experience worthy of the man I believe he is.\u201d\n\nScott said he didn\u2019t have anything specific planned while in Las Vegas.\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019ve gotten the lessons I need from Las Vegas and that\u2019s to bury this hatchet,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t have any bitterness anymore \u2026 it\u2019s gone.\u201d\n\nContact Ann Friedman at afriedman@reviewjournal.com or 702-380-4588.
