The fees, to be charged from 2014 to 2016, will provide money to insurers that incur high claims for consumers in the individual insurance market, both inside and outside the new exchanges, or marketplaces. Insurers are apprehensive that some of their new customers, having been uninsured for years, will have costly existing conditions.\n\nThe fees are to be paid by insurers in the individual, small group and large group markets, as well as by employers that serve as their own insurers.\n\nA delay in the implementation of the tax is popular with both employers and labor unions, many of which provide health coverage to members, because it would put off significant new costs.\n\nThe government set the fee for 2014 at $63 per covered life, or $5.25 a month. Insurers and some self-insured employers may have to pay not only for subscribers and employees, but also for spouses and children who are covered.\n\nThe total amount of fees to be collected over three years is $25 billion. Of that amount, $20 billion will go to the reinsurance program and $5 billion to the Treasury.\n\n\u201cThe primary purpose of the reinsurance program is to stabilize premiums in the individual market from 2014 through 2016,\u201d the Obama administration said when it proposed the rules in December 2012. \u201cThe reinsurance program is designed to protect against issuers\u2019 potential perceived need to raise premiums due to the implementation of the 2014 market reform rules, specifically guaranteed availability.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe tax, the administration said, should alleviate the concerns of insurance companies about the risk of \u201chigh-cost claims from newly insured individuals.\u2019\u2019", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20131015130930, "BN": "affordable-care-act", "DISPLAYDATE": "October 15, 2013", "keywords": "Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010),Uncategorized", "PT": "Blogs", "author": "Robert Pear", "SCG": "affordable-care-act", "sourceApp": "blogs", "CLMST": "Robert Pear", "byl": "Robert Pear", "twitter": {"description": "The reinsurance fee is one of several measures intended to stabilize premiums in the individual insurance market as major provisions of President Obama\u2019s health care law take effect in January.", "creator": "@ropear", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/news/affordable-care-act/2013/10/15/a-closer-look-at-the-reinsurance-fee/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "title": "A Closer Look at the Reinsurance Fee", "card": "summary"}, "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/affordable-care-act/post", "description": "The reinsurance fee is one of several measures intended to stabilize premiums in the individual insurance market as major provisions of President Obama\u2019s health care law take effect in January.", "CG": "U.S.", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "October 15, 2013", "article": {"section": "U.S.", "tag": "Uncategorized", "published_time": 1381856970, "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/us/index.jsonp", "modified_time": "2013-10-15T17:09:30-04:00"}, "utime": 20131015170930, "PUD": 20131015, "pdate": 20131015, "des": "Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010)", "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "og": {"site_name": "In Practice", "description": "The reinsurance fee is one of several measures intended to stabilize premiums in the individual insurance market as major provisions of President Obama\u2019s health care law take effect in January.", "title": "A Closer Look at the Reinsurance Fee", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/news/affordable-care-act/2013/10/15/a-closer-look-at-the-reinsurance-fee/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs_v3/../../packages/images/nytdesign/2013/national/inPractice/inPractice-75.png", "type": "article"}, "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "A Closer Look at the Reinsurance Fee", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "PST": "Blog Post"}, "article_summary": "Of that amount, $20 billion will go to the reinsurance program and $5 billion to the Treasury.\nThe reinsurance tax is one of several measures intended to stabilize premiums in the individual insurance market as major provisions of the health care law take effect in January.\n\u201cThe primary purpose of the reinsurance program is to stabilize premiums in the individual market from 2014 through 2016,\u201d the Obama administration said when it proposed the rules in December 2012.\nThe government set the fee for 2014 at $63 per covered life, or $5.25 a month.\nThe fees, to be charged from 2014 to 2016, will provide money to insurers that incur high claims for consumers in the individual insurance market, both inside and outside the new exchanges, or marketplaces."}
