(REUTERS/Dominick Reuter)\n\nMIT economist Jonathan Gruber \u201cwas paid almost $400,000 by this administration.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), on Fox News\u2019s \u201cOn the Record,\u201d Nov. 12, 2014\n\nRepublicans are demanding hearings into videos that have emerged in recent days of MIT professor Jonathan Gruber making impolitic remarks about the Affordable Care Act.\n\nWhy should Gruber\u2019s comments matter? Because Gruber is well-known in health-care circles as one of the intellectual godfathers of Obamacare and the very similar law in Massachusetts (sometimes called Romneycare), though people involved in ACA deny he was \u201can architect\u201d of the ACA. (House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi (Calif.) claimed she did not know who he is, even though she once had touted his work.)\n\nBarrasso, in the Fox News interview, said Gruber\u2019s comments about the \u201cstupidity of the American voter\u201d were so reprehensible that \u201che ought to just give the money back.\u201d\n\nDid Gruber really earn nearly $400,000 from the administration \u2014 and if so, why?\n\nThe Facts\n\nIn 2009, just one month after President Obama took office, the Department of Health and Human Services put out a sole-source solicitation titled \u201cTechnical Assistance in Evaluating Options for Health Reform.\u201d The contract would be with Gruber, who the document said was the only person \u201creasonably available to satisfy agency requirements.\u201d\n\nAs the agency put it, \u201cDr. Gruber developed a proprietary statistically sophisticated micro-simulation model that has the flexibility to ascertain the distribution of changes in health care spending and public and private sector health care costs due to a large variety of changes in health insurance benefit design, public program eligibility criteria, and tax policy.\u201d\n\nThe model, the Gruber Microsimulation Model, is the coin of the realm, in large part because it is similar to the model used by the Congressional Budget Office. That means administration policy-makers could predict with reasonable certainty how CBO would score legislation. Given that legislation in Washington often falls or rises depending on the CBO score, that made this model a very powerful tool for administration officials.\n\nThe first four months of the contract could not be found on the FedBizOpp.gov Web site, but in June 2009, HHS renewed the contract for eight months, with a value of $297,600. Gruber in an e-mail confirmed that the first part of the contract was for $95,000.\n\nThat adds up to $392,600 \u2014 or \u201calmost $400,000.\u201d\n\nGruber\u2019s consulting was largely unknown at the time, and eventually it became an issue as he had been frequently quoted by journalists and lawmakers who may not have known of his connection to the administration; he also generally did not disclose his connection when writing opinion articles.\n\nIn one especially fishy circumstance, Nancy-Ann DeParle, at the time director of the White House Office of Health Reform, wrote about Gruber\u2019s work on the White House blog on Nov. 29, 2009. \u201cMIT Economist Confirms Senate Health Reform Bill Reduces Costs and Improves Coverage\u201d was the headline on the post.\n\nDeParle made no reference to the fact that Gruber had already earned hundreds of thousands of dollars working for the administration. She described him as an \u201cMIT economist who has been closely following the health insurance reform process.\u201d\n\n(The emphasis on reducing costs in Gruber\u2019s report is especially interesting in light of the Gruber video that emerged Thursday. \u201cWhat the American public cares about is costs,\u201d Gruber said in 2010. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why even though the bill that they made is 90 percent health insurance coverage and 10 percent about cost control, all you ever hear people talk about is cost control.\u201d)\n\nIn any case, the passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010 has been lucrative for Gruber and his microsimulation model. All told, he has been hired by at least eight states to provide advice or assist in creating the health-insurance exchanges that are at the heart of the Affordable Care Act: Colorado, Connecticut, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Vermont, West Virginia and Wisconsin.\n\nNot all of the contracts could be found on public Web sites, but here is a sampling. In some cases, Gruber worked with other consultants, so the fees were shared. These figures also might not represent the final payout, and of course these are gross figures, before expenses. But it\u2019s safe to say that about $400,000 appears to be the standard rate for gaining access to the Gruber Microsimulation Model.\n\nMichigan: $481,050\n\nMinnesota: $329,000\n\nVermont: $400,000\n\nWisconsin: $400,000\n\nGruber has also earned more than $2 million over the last seven years for an ongoing contract with HHS to assess choices made by the elderly in Medicare\u2019s prescription-drug plan.\n\nThe Pinocchio Test\n\nBarrasso quite accurately pegged Gruber\u2019s contract for advising the administration during the crafting of the Affordable Care Act as \u201calmost $400,000.\u201d He earns a coveted Geppetto Checkmark.\n\nIn the meantime, The Fact Checker is wondering why he did not become a health economist. Clearly, Gruber\u2019s model became even more in demand after Obamacare was signed into law.\n\nThe Geppetto Checkmark\n\n\n\n\n\n(About our rating scale)\n\nSend us facts to check by filling out this form\n\nFollow The Fact Checker on Twitter and friend us on Facebook", "article_metadata": {"description": "The MIT professor earned big bucks during the debate over Obamacare, but the real payday came after passage of the bill.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/FactChecker", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The MIT professor earned big bucks during the debate over Obamacare, but the real payday came after passage of the bill.", "title": "Did Jonathan Gruber earn \u2018almost $400,000\u2032 from the Obama administration?", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2014/11/14/did-jonathan-gruber-earn-almost-400000-from-the-obama-administration/", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/11/13/Outlook/Images/RTR3GTJA.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@GlennKesslerWP"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2014/11/14/did-jonathan-gruber-earn-almost-400000-from-the-obama-administration/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "jonathan gruber; gruber obamacare; affordable care act; stupidity american voter; grubergate; repeal obamacare; obama health law; obama gruber; glenn kessler; fact checker; factchecker", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/FactChecker"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "jonathan gruber; gruber obamacare; affordable care act; stupidity american voter; grubergate; repeal obamacare; obama health law; obama gruber; glenn kessler; fact checker; factchecker"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2b3a\"", "article_summary": "(REUTERS/Dominick Reuter)MIT economist Jonathan Gruber \u201cwas paid almost $400,000 by this administration.\u201d\u2014 Sen.
