He tried that stunt the last time ObamaCare was before the Nine, and Chief Justice Roberts switched his vote.\n\nWas the chief justice afraid? That is the word I keep thinking of. It is the word at the heart of perhaps the most famous utterance on religious freedom in American history \u2014 George Washington\u2019s letter to the Jews.\n\nOur first president sent it in 1790, replying to the warm greeting addressed to him by the members of the Touro Synagogue when Washington had visited Rhode Island.\n\nNo one mentioned Washington\u2019s letter during Tuesday\u2019s oral arguments before the high court. Yet the case against the birth-control mandate of ObamaCare is being brought by two families of religious Christians \u2014 the Greens and the Hahns \u2014 who are just the sort of pious persons Washington welcomed to the new republic.\n\nWashington wrote of the \u201cdays of difficulty and danger\u201d of the Revolution. He wrote about how, if we could find wisdom, we \u201ccannot fail, under the just administration of a good government, to become a great and happy people.\u201d\n\nAmericans had \u201cgiven to mankind examples of an enlarged and liberal policy,\u201d Washington wrote.\n\n\u201cAll possess alike liberty of conscience and immunities of citizenship,\u201d the president wrote. No longer, he added, was toleration \u201cspoken of as if it were the indulgence of one class of people that another enjoyed the exercise of their inherent natural rights.\u201d\n\nThe reason was that \u201chappily, the Government of the United States, which gives to bigotry no sanction, to persecution no assistance, requires only that they who live under its protection should demean themselves as good citizens in giving it on all occasions their effectual support.\u201d\n\nWashington made a point of avowing that he was pleased that the members of the Touro Synagogue had a favorable opinion of his administration and had expressed \u201cfervent wishes for my felicity.\u201d It was formal, even a bit awkward, but in any event a touching note of appreciation.\n\nAnd then came the famous words: \u201cMay the children of the stock of Abraham who dwell in this land continue to merit and enjoy the good will of the other inhabitants \u2014 while every one shall sit in safety under his own vine and fig tree and there shall be none to make him afraid.\u201d\n\nI have often thought about that sentence \u2014 which echoes Micah 4:4 in the Hebrew Bible \u2014 for years. It\u2019s not an unconditional welcome: Washington prays that the Jews \u201cmerit\u201d as well as \u201cenjoy\u201d good will. But neither is it limited to the Jews: The prayer to be able to sit in safety is sought for \u201cevery one\u201d so that \u201cthere shall be none to make him afraid.\u201d\n\nThere is that word \u2014 \u201cafraid.\u201d\n\nIt is hard to imagine right now that the families before the Supreme Court are not afraid. David Green, owner of Hobby Lobby, has spent a lifetime building a company that may be forced to choose between its religion and millions of dollars in fines, or even dissolution.\n\nThe same must be true of Norman Hahn, whose family owns Conestoga Wood Specialties. They are Mennonites, whose ancestors were driven all over, and even out of, Europe rather than give up on their religious principles. All they\u2019ve built up here could now be in jeopardy.\n\nHow can Washington\u2019s prayer not encompass such families? They are not asking anyone to be denied birth control or abortion-type drugs. But they fear God\u2019s judgment if they take part, and they clearly fear being forced to take part. No one in this case has ever questioned their sincerity.\n\nIs there going to be no place in the American system for them \u2014 and, incidentally, for the Orthodox Jews who have filed amici briefs on their side of the case? No doubt the Nine will have their work cut out for them. What a tangle of legal cases they\u2019re going to have to sort through.\n\nPresident Washington ended his letter to the Jews with a prayer that seems as apt now as it was then: \u201cMay the father of all mercies scatter light, and not darkness, upon our paths, and make us all in our several vocations useful here, and in His own due time and way everlastingly happy.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "New York Post", "twitter": {"description": "Sometime before June, if things go true to form, President Obama is going to issue a warning to the Supreme Court to look after its reputation and refrain from outlawing the birth-control mandate of", "title": "ObamaCare, fear & George Washington\u2019s letter to the Jews", "image": "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/mennon.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=664&h=441&crop=1", "creator": "@nypost", "site": "@nypost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"post_id\":\"nypost-4095856\"}", "sailthru.tags": "birth-control,hobby-lobby,obamacare,religion,supreme-court,", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://nypost.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/0b14d9dbf0c711522a906102b60f3da0?s=16", "generator": "WordPress.com", "sailthru.date": "2014-03-26 22:48:56", "sailthru.title": "ObamaCare, fear & George Washington\u2019s letter to the\u00a0Jews", "nypost-section": "Opinion", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/mennon.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=231&h=154&crop=1", "description": "Sometime before June, if things go true to form, President Obama is going to issue a warning to the Supreme Court to look after its reputation and refrain from outlawing the birth-control mandate of ObamaCare.
