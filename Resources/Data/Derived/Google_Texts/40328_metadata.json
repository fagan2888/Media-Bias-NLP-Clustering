I\u2019m both humbled and grateful to the Tea Party Express for this opportunity tonight.\n\n\n\nI\u2019m also thankful for my Dad \u2013 and especially my Mom \u2013 my hero.\n\n\n\nI\u2019m thankful for our veterans and men and women in uniform; defending our freedom and liberty all over the globe.\n\n\n\nFinally I give thanks to OUR God \u2013 for the blessings of this great nation \u2013 founded in liberty and opportunity for all.\n\n\n\nPresident Obama just presented his proposals for America \u2013 pretty much the same rhetoric we\u2019ve heard for the past six years. I\u2019m not here to pick apart his ideas one by one \u2013 but to offer a very different vision for our nation.\n\n\n\nFurther burdening the American economy with even higher taxes is wrong.\n\n\n\nJust as more debt and more unfunded programs are wrong.\n\n\n\nThe Tea Party Express and I see an America where solutions rest not in big government \u2013 but in personal liberties \u2013 in free enterprise \u2013 and in the opportunity for all to pursue their own American Dream \u2013 regardless of race, creed, or conditions of birth.\n\n\n\nTo restore our nation to greatness \u2013 we need to empower and enable individual achievement.\n\n\n\nWe need to get past the idea that Washington can solve all of our problems.\n\n\n\nGovernment and decisions must move closer to home \u2013 including more local and family choice on education and on healthcare.\n\n\n\nOur vision is NOT based on wealth redistribution \u2013 but on economic liberty, private enterprise, and wealth creation that benefits everyone.\n\n\n\nWe believe that ALL Americans ultimately want the same things. We all want to achieve our own unique American Dream.\n\n\n\nWe want opportunity for all \u2013 but favoritism for none!\n\n\n\nAs Americans \u2013 we celebrate our diversity. We don\u2019t always see things the same way. But we can and must respect and listen to each other. And when we disagree \u2013 we\u2019ve got to do this without insulting each other.\n\n\n\nI never expected to be here addressing you at this critical time in our nation\u2019s history.\n\n\n\nJust a year ago I was active in local politics because of my concerns about water resources in South Florida and preserving the Florida Everglades \u2013 a real national treasure.\n\n\n\nI ran for Congress because I was deeply concerned about the direction of our great nation.\n\n\n\nI saw an America deeply divided \u2013 bogged down in partisan bickering \u2013 with lobbyists and special interest groups lining their pockets at the expense of hard-working Americans.\n\n\n\nAs we restore the voice of \u201cwe the people\u201d \u2013 we need to grow the private sector \u2013 and shrink the size and reach of our federal government.\n\n\n\nI have joined a growing TEAM of newcomers to Washington who believe as I do. We\u2019re bringing business experience to develop viable solutions to our economic problems.\n\n\n\nWe believe in economic liberty and equal opportunity \u2013 not equal outcomes imposed by a bloated federal government.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s really odd to me that these basic principles have somehow become \u201coutsider\u201d \u2013 or even radical views \u2013 as some suggest.\n\n\n\nDecades ago \u2013 I played basketball at Purdue for Coach Gene Keady \u2013 a mentor and a hero. I looked around that locker room and found a group of players from very different backgrounds.\n\n\n\nWe had a guard from the West Coast, a forward from Gary, a post player from Cincinnati, a power forward from the West Side of Chicago, a center from Long Island, and me, an outside shooter from the cornfields of Indiana.\n\n\n\nWe came to Purdue with diverse racial, religious, ethnic, and economic backgrounds.\n\n\n\nBut Coach Keady quickly taught us the profound meaning of the word TEAM.\n\n\n\nIn spite of our differences, he taught us to work together \u2013 and to always put the TEAM first. That\u2019s how he got the best out of all of us.\n\n\n\nAnd I say that\u2019s exactly what we need to do in America today!\n\n\n\nAt Purdue, our biggest challenge was not the other TEAM. It was in our own locker room. To WIN \u2013 we had to learn to work together. That was true for the role players on the TEAM \u2013 like me \u2013 as well as for the stars.\n\n\n\nAs Coach molded us \u2013 we learned to respect each other. Then we began to trust each other. Rely on each other. And finally we learned to truly care about each other.\n\n\n\nIn my senior year, after being picked ninth in the Big Ten, we put our differences aside, played hard, put the TEAM first \u2013 and WON a share of the Big Ten championship! We won on the court by uniting in the locker-room. And we learned that we\u2019re all the same. We\u2019re all the same!\n\n\n\nWashington could benefit from Coach Keady\u2019s advice.\n\n\n\nNow of course the enormous challenges facing our country are far more complex than bringing a diverse basketball TEAM together.\n\n\n\nBut I say teamwork is essential in all walks of life. And I also say that liberty is the great equalizer.\n\n\n\nEconomic liberty will bring America back to its destiny as the world\u2019s beacon of light and opportunity. Economic liberty is the foundation of the American Dream. We can never compromise these conservative values.\n\n\n\nDividing us \u2013 or punishing success in the name of fairness \u2013 will not unite Americans.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2014 our economy continued sluggish growth \u2013 and millions of Americans are still out of work.\n\n\n\nAs described in my economic plan, we should target growing this economy by 5% annually.\n\n\n\nA strong and vibrant economy will help businesses create millions of good-paying American jobs \u2013 while freeing millions from government dependency.\n\n\n\nTo do this we\u2019ve got to enable American companies to compete fairly in a global market. We\u2019ve got to reduce burdensome regulations and reduce the business tax rate, currently the highest in the developed world.\n\n\n\nIn 1962 \u2013 John F. Kennedy said:\n\n\n\n\u201cThere is no need for us to be satisfied with a rate of growth that keeps good men out of work and good capacity out of use.\u201d\n\n\n\nA year later President Kennedy added:\n\n\n\n\u201cThe final and best means of strengthening demand among consumers and businesses is to reduce the burden on private income and reduce the deterrents to private initiative which are imposed by our present tax system\u201d\n\n\n\nI say that we need to begin by cutting the small business and corporate tax rates in half \u2013 to 17.5% \u2013 and take out the loopholes!\n\n\n\nWe also need to lift the economic shackles of ObamaCare. It makes us uncompetitive \u2013 and has not let us keep our plans, as we were promised.\n\n\n\nWe can do better, ya\u2019ll. We\u2019ve got to replace ObamaCare with a fair, patient-focused, market-based system. And no one should lose their healthcare.\n\n\n\nWe can\u2019t expect to move America ahead by heaping higher taxes on achievement \u2013 or by the government printing or borrowing money and piling debt onto future generations. I say NO!\n\n\n\nWe can\u2019t spend our way to prosperity with more entitlements or more government handouts.\n\n\n\nLong-term sustainable solutions require an empowered private sector \u2013 led by small businesses and American innovation!\n\n\n\nThat must include energy independence. A major step forward here would be for the President to approve the completion of the Keystone Pipeline.\n\n\n\nSuccess for our nation also means embracing diversity \u2013 including legal immigrants \u2013 and the millions waiting in line LEGALLY to begin their own American Dream. Legal immigration has long been and remains a key to America\u2019s greatness!\n\n\n\nTo those who speak Spanish, I say:\n\n\n\nTodos creemos en dios, la familia , el trabajo, y la libertad. Hay que respetar la ley. Pero, ustedes son bienvenidos con nosotros. Todos somos iguales. Por supuesto. Nuestra casa es su casa.\n\n\n\n\"We all believe in God, the family, hard work, and liberty. The law must be followed. You are all welcome with us. We are all equal. Of course. Our house is your house.\"\n\n\n\nAs we respect our immigration laws \u2013 we\u2019ve also got to be fair to the more than 10 million Americans currently struggling to find good jobs! We all know who they are. They are our friends, family, and neighbors.\n\n\n\nTo do this, we need to secure our borders first! This is important for fairness \u2013 and security \u2013 for all Americans.\n\n\n\nFinally, we must unite against the global terrorist threat of radical Islam. We must not shy away from calling this threat by its name. We must join with our partners in Muslim nations, our friends in Israel, and a coalition of freedom-loving nations around the world.\n\n\n\nAmerica must lead this coalition \u2013 but we must end the disproportionate sacrifice of American blood and treasure. Our allies must step up and contribute more in this fight.\n\n\n\nAnd we\u2019ve got to stop getting into BAD wars. Too much dying !!!\n\nToday, the Light of the Statue of Liberty \u2013 a gift from our French partners for independence \u2013 shines across the Hudson to the footprint of the Twin Towers. Last week, leaders of the world gathered in Paris \u2013 to shine that light of liberty as a TEAM.\n\nTo our friends in the \u201cCity of Lights\u201d I say:\n\nYou were our allies in America\u2019s war for Independence. Now it\u2019s our turn to side with you in this global battle against terrorism.\n\nTogether we\u2019ve got to light the torch of freedom for the entire world. With our God and Liberty as partners on our TEAM \u2013 we will succeed.\n\nThank you. And may God continue to bless \u201cAmerica the Beautiful.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Rep.
