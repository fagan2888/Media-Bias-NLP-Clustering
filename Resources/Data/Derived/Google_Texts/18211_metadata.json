This is really going to help students stay in school, finish school, go onto college, get good jobs, make Tulsa a better place to live,\" said Kim Schutz, Director of the Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy.\n\nSchutz said this program is not your traditional textbook sex education program.\n\n\"That's really one of the main focuses of the campaign, is to get everybody talking,\" Schutz said.\n\nAdministrators say this is a pilot program for the entire school district. Eventually, outside program coordinators will hand off the teaching roles to classroom teachers.\n\n\"I think, ignoring the issue is something we don't have the luxury of doing any longer,\" Schutz said.\n\nNow that the board has passed the issue, the classes will start in October for students at Clinton Middle School, Memorial junior high and high schools and Webster High Schools.\n\nSchool administrators say they will have sessions for parents to get educated on the new class offering, as well. Letters to opt-in will be in the mail soon.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-14", "Description": "The Tulsa Public School board approved Tuesday night, an expansion of sex education, but only in four schools.", "author": "Tony Russell", "og": {"url": "http://www.news9.com/story/23329268/tulsa-school-board-to-vote-on-exanding-sex-education-in-select-schools", "image": "http://KOTV.images.worldnow.com/images/23329268_SA.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The Tulsa Public School board approved Tuesday night, an expansion of sex education, but only in four schools.", "title": "Tulsa School Board Approves Expanding Sex Education In Select Schools"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KOTV.images.worldnow.com/images/23329268_SA.jpg", "description": "The Tulsa Public School board approved Tuesday night, an expansion of sex education, but only in four schools.", "card": "summary", "title": "Tulsa School Board Approves Expanding Sex Education In Select Schools"}, "wnreadableurl": "tulsa-school-board-to-vote-on-exanding-sex-education-in-select-schools", "ROBOTS": "index,follow,noarchive", "owner": "KOTV", "fb": {"app_id": 538140636230283}, "date": "2013/09/03", "KEYWORDS": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,newsok,channel 9,channel nine,news 9,television,this morning,live radar,kwtv,sports,video,live streaming,interactive", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS28", "verify-v1": "d5ZN+GNiazjgWlnr3WHikwraMvFljdUSLMgex4CGnc8=", "news_keywords": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,newsok,channel 9,channel nine,news 9,television,this morning,live radar,kwtv,sports,video,live streaming,interactive"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca5fa\"", "article_summary": "The Tulsa Public School board approved Tuesday night, an expansion of sex education, but only in four schools.\nNow that the board has passed the issue, the classes will start in October for students at Clinton Middle School, Memorial junior high and high schools and Webster High Schools.\nTulsa Public Schools voted Tuesday night to expand its sex education program.\nNow, it will be offered to 7th, 9th, and 11th at two high schools and two middle schools, as part of the day-to-day class schedule, if parents opt in.\nSchutz said this program is not your traditional textbook sex education program."}
