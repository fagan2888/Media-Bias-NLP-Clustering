Sen. Chuck Grassley, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, has advocated for Ebinger and negotiated a deal for her confirmation.\n\nIn December, the Iowa senator brokered the deal between Republican and Democrat leaders to advance five of Obama\u2019s nominees to the Senate floor for a vote before President\u2019s Day next Monday. Two of them are from Grassley\u2019s home state.\n\nSo far in 2016, three of those nominees have won Senate confirmation, including Wilhelmina Wright, a controversial judge who accused President Ronald Reagan of bigotry and racism. The two remaining nominees are Ebinger and Leonard Strand, two Iowans who moved to the front of the line, past a backlog of other nominees.\n\nThe politically astute Grassley is running for re-election in Iowa this year. But his deal comes as the debate over Obama\u2019s final judicial nominees heats up nationally.\n\nSome organizations, like Heritage Action, have advocated freezing all of the president\u2019s judicial nominees in protest of what conservatives consider executive overreach.\n\n\u201cHeritage Action will continue to oppose all judicial nominees,\u201d the group said in a statement. \u201cSenators should not stand by idly for the next 12 months. They must act to reassert their constitutional prerogatives.\u201d\n\nOthers, such as the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, argue that the process is too political already and have complained about delays in advancing nominees.\n\n\u201cBlocking judicial nominations may delight right-wing ideologues\u2014like Heritage Action,\u201d the group said, \u201cbut it would seriously damage the judicial system and be an irresponsible abdication of the Senate\u2019s constitutional responsibility to advise and consent on nominees.\u201d\n\nThe ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, Patrick Leahy, has led the opposition to freezing the nomination process.\n\nIn a Jan. 19 floor speech, Leahy said efforts to \u201cshut down the judicial confirmation process\u201d were meant \u201cto satisfy moneyed Washington interest groups.\u201d He added, \u201cIt would only work to harm our justice system and the American people.\u201d\n\nGrassley rejects the notion that Republicans have purposely gummed up the nomination process.\n\nBefore the Jan. 11 confirmation of Luis Restrepo to a lifetime post on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit, Grassley noted that there were \u201cmore nominees\u201d confirmed under Obama than when George W. Bush was president.\n\nWhen Bush was in the White House, the Senate confirmed 297 court nominees between 2000 and 2008. In Bush\u2019s final year in office, when Democrats held the majority, the Senate confirmed four circuit court nominees before June and 24 district court nominees before September.\n\nSo far during the seven-year tenure of the Obama administration, the Senate has confirmed 322 nominees. Fourteen of those came during the 114th Congress, while Republicans controlled the Senate and Grassley served as chairman of the Judiciary Committee.\n\nIn his Jan. 11 speech on the Senate floor, Grassley promised that \u201cthe Senate Judiciary Committee will continue to hold hearings this year on judicial nominees, and we\u2019ll continue to do our due diligence in evaluating those nominees.\u201d\n\nComplicating matters for Obama is the so-called Thurmond-Leahy rule\u2014an unofficial agreement among senators that generally halts confirmations during the last six months of an outgoing president\u2019s term.\n\nA spokesman from the Senate Judiciary Committee left open the possibility of getting \u201cfuture nominations approved.\u201d He noted that Grassley does not control the Senate calendar and is \u201cfollowing the committee precedent set by [former] Chairman Leahy.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Though President Barack Obama\u2019s time in office is drawing to a close, the Senate pipeline for judicial nominees remains open.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Though President Barack Obama\u2019s time in office is drawing to a close, the Senate pipeline for judicial nominees remains open.", "title": "GOP-Led Senate Is About to Approve Another Obama Judge", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/Grassley.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-12T10:34:18+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1T3JFr1"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Though President Barack Obama\u2019s time in office is drawing to a close, the Senate pipeline for judicial nominees remains open.", "title": "GOP-Led Senate Is About to Approve Another Obama Judge", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/Grassley.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Law", "tag": "nominations", "published_time": "2016-02-07T11:12:39+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-12T10:34:18+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Chuck Grassley, Leahy Rule, Senate Judiciary Committee, Obama, Judicial Nominations, Congress, Senate"}, "article_summary": "In Bush\u2019s final year in office, when Democrats held the majority, the Senate confirmed four circuit court nominees before June and 24 district court nominees before September.\nWhen Bush was in the White House, the Senate confirmed 297 court nominees between 2000 and 2008.\nSome organizations, like Heritage Action, have advocated freezing all of the president\u2019s judicial nominees in protest of what conservatives consider executive overreach.\nThough President Barack Obama\u2019s time in office is drawing to a close, the Senate pipeline for judicial nominees remains open.\nFourteen of those came during the 114th Congress, while Republicans controlled the Senate and Grassley served as chairman of the Judiciary Committee."}
