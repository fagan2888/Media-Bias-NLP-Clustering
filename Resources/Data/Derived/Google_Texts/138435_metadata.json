Their mother was initially arrested on unrelated outstanding warrants for theft and disorderly conduct.\n\nThe day-long search for the children had been focused around the Del Sol apartment complex, located at 6525 W. Montebello.\n\nPolice say a mother, now identified as 25-year-old Shawntaye Beavers, left her 4- and 2-year-old daughters with her 8-year-old son while she ran an errand Saturday around noon. When she returned home, all three kids were missing and there was no sign of forced entry. Beavers called 911 around 1 p.m.\n\nAccording to Glendale police, \"detectives believe the mother left the children in the home unsupervised and alone for what appears to be a longer period of time than originally reported.\"\n\nAll afternoon and through the evening, Glendale police went door-to-door and searched cars coming and going from the neighborhood.\n\nBut after a nine-hour search, the 8-year-old, Christian Schoonover, the 4-year-old, Lydia Zamora, and the 2-year-old, LillyAnna Zamora, have all been found safe with a grandmother. Police said a relative came by the apartment and took the kids out of concern after realizing they had been left alone.\n\nThe father of the two young girls lives at the apartment as well but was at work when the kids were left alone, according to police.\n\nPolice said the apartment is filthy and has feces on the floors. According to Glendale police, \"Officers and detectives found the home to be unsanitary. Detectives described it as unkempt and dirty with fecal matter found inside the home.\"\n\nThe Department of Child Safety is also involved and the children are with a child advocate for the night.\n\nIn addition, family members will continue to be interviewed by detectives.\n\nFOUND: 3 missing children from 6525 W.
