Four Bakersfield businesses are on a state list for having outstanding sales and use tax delinquencies, the California State Board of Equalization (BOE) said.

The list, put out by the BOE, features the top 500 companies in California who have outstanding tax debt.

Companies and organizations are only placed on the list if they have racked up six-figured debt.

Officials from the BOE said it's important that the taxes are paid because they go to fund such public services as roads, schools, police departments and other public services for the State of California.

Below you can find a list of the companies on the list.
