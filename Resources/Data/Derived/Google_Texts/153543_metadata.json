Federico Lombardi, the Vatican\u2019s spokesman, told reporters about it.\n\nLombardi pointed out that Francis had spoken about US bishops and their quest for religious freedom during his speech at the White House earlier that day, and he said that the visit to the Sisters was \u201cconnected\u201d to those remarks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nArchbishop Joseph Kurtz, president of the US Conference of Catholic Bishops, weighed in during the same press briefing.\n\n\u201cFreedom of religion requires us also to live out our faith,\u201d he said. \u201cThe last thing the Little Sisters of the Poor want to do is sue somebody.\u201d\n\nAfter Lombardi\u2019s announcement about the meeting, photos of the pope smiling and greeting the Sisters began to circulate online.\n\nThe next day, we now know, Francis met Kim Davis, the Kentucky clerk who was jailed because she refused to comply with a court order to issue marriage licenses, or allow her staff to issue them, because of her opposition to same-sex marriage.\n\nNews of this meeting was not made public until days after Francis left the United States, and it came to light not at a Vatican press conference, but when a veteran Vatican journalist broke the news Tuesday evening. Davis\u2019 lawyers at the Liberty Counsel, an Evangelical nonprofit organization that works on issues related to religious freedom, then confirmed it.\n\nSeveral hours later, Lombardi, back in Rome, said the Vatican would not deny that the meeting took place, but that he would not issue any more comments about it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA spokesman for the USCCB said Wednesday that Kurtz, who was with Francis for nearly every portion of his visit, was not aware of the meeting until he heard the news when it broke Tuesday night.\n\n(A spokeswoman for the Archdiocese of Louisville, which Kurtz leads, said the archdiocese is \u201cfollowing the lead of the Holy See\u201d and would not comment about the meeting.)\n\nAnother USSCB official confirmed that the organization played no role in organizing the meeting with Davis.\n\nLater on Wednesday, the Vatican\u2019s newspaper announced that no photos of the encounter would be released.\n\nMat Staver, a Liberty Counsel lawyer, said \u201cthe Vatican\u201d requested the meeting, but he would not elaborate on who had reached out. This led several reports to conclude that Pope Francis himself personally requested the meeting.\n\nBut according to someone with knowledge of the situation who spoke on the condition on anonymity because he is not authorized to speak publicly about the meeting, the apostolic nuncio (ambassador) to the United States, Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigano, arranged the Davis meeting.\n\nSeveral calls and emails to Vigano were not returned Thursday.\n\nVigano was assigned to be the pope\u2019s representative to the United States in 2012 by Pope Benedict XVI, and he was reportedly unhappy about the move. Earlier this year, Vigano was a featured speaker at the March for Marriage in Washington, where he was touted as \u201cthe official representative of Pope Francis.\u201d (Kurtz also attended.)\n\nThe Davis meeting struck some Church observers as odd and a departure from the pope\u2019s tone during his many public talks while in the United States.\n\nWriting at America magazine, the Rev. James Martin said there are many unanswered questions, and he cautioned against reading too much into any one meeting.\n\n\u201cDid he know much about Kim Davis before meeting her?\u201d Martin asked. \u201cWas he following her case before he entered the country? Did he learn about the controversy from a local bishop after he arrived? Or was her story quickly relayed to him in a receiving line? And how was it explained to him?\u201d\n\nBut at The Week, Michael Brendan Dougherty said the angst on the Catholic left about the Davis meeting is a result of the pope going against the narrative created for him by the secular press.\n\n\u201cPope Francis is supposed to be the cool pope. He humiliates traditionalist cardinals. He embraces transexuals. If he occasionally says stuff against gay marriage, well, so what?\u201d he wrote.\n\nThe pope\u2019s message to Davis, according to Dougherty? \u201cThe world hates you. I do not.\u201d\n\nVatican officials maintained their silence about the meeting until Friday, but Liberty Counsel did not.\n\nStaver, the lawyer, told Time magazine Wednesday that his organization had not provided any background materials about Davis to Church officials, and that he was unsure if the pope knew the details of Davis\u2019 situation.\n\nLater in the day, however, Staver told NPR he was certain the pope was aware of Davis.\n\n\u201cHe would know the background of the person. He would know who he\u2019s meeting with. And obviously, he would know Kim Davis, and he would know the story of Kim Davis,\u201d he said.\n\nSo while the Vatican and US bishops remained mum about the situation, Davis and her lawyers continued to set the narrative.\n\nFor her part, Davis, who is not Catholic, called meeting the pope \u201chumbling\u201d and said, \u201cJust knowing the pope is on track with what we\u2019re doing and agreeing, you know, kind of validates everything.\u201d\n\nBut one Jesuit priest with close ties to the Vatican published a tweet Thursday with his interpretation of what transpired, comparing the Davis meeting to a Ugandan politician who claimed a papal endorsement after a routine encounter with Pope Benedict XVI in 2012.\n\n2 good Popes who bless people not asking them ID (and then exploited) : #BenedictXVI with #RebeccaKadaga & #PopeFrancis with #KimDavis \u2014 Antonio Spadaro SJ (@antoniospadaro) September 30, 2015\n\nThe Vatican not commenting on private meetings isn\u2019t unique to Davis. Earlier this year, the Vatican would neither confirm nor deny that Francis had met with a transgender Catholic, and last year it did the same about a call Francis had placed to a divorced and remarried woman.\n\nBut early Friday morning, the Vatican\u2019s spokesman finally weighed in after a meeting with Pope Francis. Lombardi issued a statement to \u201ccontribute to an objective understanding of what transpired.\u201d\n\nAccording to Lombardi, Davis was one \u201cof several dozens persons who had been invited by the Nunciature to greet\u201d the pontiff before he left Washington, stating that the encounter \u201cshould not be considered a form of support of her position in all of its particular and complex aspects.\u201d Further, Lombardi said, Francis \u201cdid not enter into the details of the situation of Mrs. Davis.\u201d\n\nVery soon after, the Liberty Counsel released a statement challenging Lombardi\u2019s\u2013and the pope\u2019s\u2013recollection of the meeting.\n\nSo the question remains: Why did the pope\u2019s own ambassador arrange the secret meeting, without the assistance of US bishops, leading to \u201cnon-denials\u201d and an eventual distancing from the Vatican, as well as a sense of uncertainty about the pope\u2019s intended message in Washington?", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.cruxnow.com/life/2015/10/02/a-tale-of-two-papal-meetings/", "image": "http://www.cruxnow.com/wp-content/themes/crux/library/images/favicons/favicon-200.png", "type": "article", "description": "The silence surrounding the pope's meeting with Kentucky clerk Kim Davis stood in stark contrast to the publicity about the pope's encounter with nuns fighting the White House.", "title": "A tale of two papal meetings"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#d1d2d3", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.cruxnow.com/wp-content/themes/crux/images/win8-tile-icon.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7163\"", "article_summary": "But early Friday morning, the Vatican\u2019s spokesman finally weighed in after a meeting with Pope Francis.\n\u201cPope Francis is supposed to be the cool pope.\nThis led several reports to conclude that Pope Francis himself personally requested the meeting.\nEarlier this year, Vigano was a featured speaker at the March for Marriage in Washington, where he was touted as \u201cthe official representative of Pope Francis.\u201d (Kurtz also attended.)\nAnd obviously, he would know Kim Davis, and he would know the story of Kim Davis,\u201d he said."}
