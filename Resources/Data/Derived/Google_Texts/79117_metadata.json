This happened most profoundly in a high-profile education dispute where Obama and his administration were nowhere to be seen, though they had done everything to set the stage, with their own brand of corporate education \u201creform\u201d: Race to the Top.\n\nOn one side, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio addressed a rally in support of his universal pre-K proposal for New York City, to be funded by a tax on those earning $500,000 a year or more. It\u2019s a classic expression of the public universalism of the social democratic vision, epitomized by programs like Medicare, Social Security, the public option and universal public education in general. That vision stands in contrast to the market-based privatized particularism of neoliberalism, epitomized by welfare reform, voucher-based systems like Obamacare, charter schools and for-profit education.\n\n\u201cThe facts are on our side. The people are on our side. Now, we have to get Albany on our side,\u201d de Blasio said. The unstated problem: Wall Street is firmly entrenched on the opposite side.\n\nWitness the competing neoliberal rally, organized by high-paid NYC charter CEO Eva Moskowitz, a former New York City Council member, which drew a rah-rah speech from New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo \u2014 who opposed de Blasio\u2019s proposal to fund the program through a tax on high earners, and received almost $400,000 from Moskowitz\u2019s hedge fund backers alone (plus more from other Wall Street charter school backers). That rally attacked de Blasio for his modest cutbacks in expanding charter schools co-located in public school buildings, along with his proposal to charge them rent, which is actually required under existing New York state law.\n\n\u201cWe will save charter schools,\u201d Cuomo told the pro-charter rally. But that\u2019s just typical political hysteria. No one is threatening to destroy charter schools, despite their decidedly lackluster records.(It\u2019s the same with another neoliberal \u201creform\u201d favorite, vouchers, as Milwaukee, the voucher pioneer, remains near the bottom of large urban school systems after 22 years of vouchers.) Indeed, more than 30 NYC charter schools had previously rejected Moskowitz\u2019s call to join her rally, in favor of supporting de Blasio\u2019s pre-K rally, saying, \u201cTuesday is not a day to be divided. Those rallying in Albany next week should stand together with the city and advocate \u2014 side by side \u2014 for our children, particularly the most underserved.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s more, de Blasio\u2019s successor as city public advocate, Letitia James, is actually suing him over the co-locations he did allow \u2014 36 of 45 locations originally approved by his predecessor Michael Bloomberg. And even James isn\u2019t talking about doing away with charters. In short, Cuomo\u2019s engaged in Fox News-style scaremongering.\n\nIf all the above sounds confusing, it\u2019s supposed to. (Just to make it even more confusing, Moskowitz\u2019s hedge fund supporters spent $3.6 million on an ad campaign attacking de Blasio and complaining that Moskowitz\u2019s charter schools can\u2019t afford to pay rent!) In the end, Cuomo put forward a budget placing strict protections on charters, and funding part of de Blasio\u2019s pre-kindergarten program \u2014 but without the high earner tax.\n\nAs with global warming deniers, so-called education reformers have nothing to lose and everything to gain by spreading confusion. Their sound bites are their strongest weapons \u2014 but for that to remain so, they need to ensure that sustained, reality-based discussions never take hold, because their words ring hollow to the well-informed. Another parallel between the two: What they\u2019re up to can\u2019t be reduced to narrow self-interest alone, but can\u2019t be understood without it. Self-interest, ideology, and status are all part of the mix.\n\nUnlike the other conflicts mentioned above, the de Blasio-Cuomo conflict is rooted in deep ideological differences, as Obama\u2019s neoliberal \u201creform\u201d agenda has much in common with that of Bush before him, and is fundamentally at odds with the Democratic Party\u2019s long-standing commitment to universal public education. It is rooted in decades of elite-generated, corporate-promoted misinformation, promoting a state of sustained panic over public education, even as graduation rates for all racial groups have steadily risen over the years.\n\nThe Panic-Reform Agenda\u2019s Five Fundamental Lies\n\nAlthough hints of it first appeared in response to Sputnik in the 1950s (the book \u201cWhy Johnny Can\u2019t Read\u201c is a classic example), the sustained panic-reform agenda for public education dates back more than 30 years now, and rests on two pairs of fundamental lies, plus a truly demented kicker. The first pair of lies deflects attention away from the real problems of poverty and race-based deprivation. The first lie is that poverty and racial discrimination have nothing to do with bad educational outcomes for those on the bottom of American society; the second, related lie is that providing adequate resources for poor and minority students will not do anything to help them. (Bruce D. Baker, lead co-author of \u201cFinancing Education Systems,\u201d a graduate-level textbook, has refuted such lies repeatedly on his School Finance 101 blog, here and here, for example, with multiple references to studies by others here.) It\u2019s particularly ironic that the enemies of public education first deny the importance of adequate funding for poor and minority students, then turn around and express support for \u201cthe civil rights movement of our time,\u201d on behalf of a small handful of those whose chances they\u2019ve worked so hard to thwart. (Is it really any surprise that charter schools are more segregated than the public schools they\u2019re trying to replace?)\n\nOnce that first pair of lies is swallowed, the way is wide open for the second pair of lies: First, on the one hand, that American education as a whole is vastly inferior to that of other countries (breakdowns of test scores by poverty levels show that it\u2019s not \u2014 see here for rough comparisons and here for a detailed analysis). Second, on the other hand, that America can catch up with them by ignoring other countries\u2019 best practices and instead embracing untested models dreamed up by ideologues and hucksters. This second lie is particularly mind-boggling, as leading critic Diane Ravitch has pointed out: \u201cNo high-performing nation in the world has handed its schools over to private management; instead, they have a strong and equitable public school system, with a respected teaching profession and a well-prepared staff.\u201d\n\nIf we really believe other countries\u2019 schools are so much better than ours, why don\u2019t we simply emulate them? Last, but not least, the kicker is the over-the-top lie that the best people to lead us in this glorious quest for educational nirvana are business leaders of one sort or another who have virtually no experience or training in education, and would probably not last 10 minutes with a class of 6-year olds.\n\nA Nation at Risk \u2014 Wrong Way Corrigan Reporting for Duty\n\nThese lies have been articles of faith among panic-reformers at least since the early 1980s, around the time of the 1983 report, \u201cA Nation at Risk: The Imperative for Educational Reform,\u201d prepared by Ronald Reagan\u2019s National Commission on Excellence in Education, which warned of \u201ca rising tide of mediocrity that threatens our very future as a Nation and a people.\u201d Within a month of its release, the Washington Post alone ran about two dozen stories about the report, almost one a day.\n\nIn early 2011, teacher/author/activist Susan Ohanian, whose 23 books include \u201cWhy Is Corporate America Bashing Our Public Schools?,\u201d explained to me how the corporate world picked up the ball and ran with it. \u201cThe California Business Roundtable got together and came up with a plan, how they were going to take control of the schools. And the national Businesses Roundtable liked it so much that they adopted it as a national plan,\u201d she told me. \u201cIBM CEO Lou Gerstner played a prominent role in the Business Roundtable at the time, and he was crucial in getting both Bush Sr. and Bill Clinton on board, with similar plans known as America 2000 under Bush, and then, when Clinton was president, it was rolled over into Goals 2000,\u201d Ohanian explained. The longer it continued, the more different ways there were for monied interests to benefit \u2014 rather like the housing bubble and the subprime mortgage marketplace \u2014 and so the movement continued to grow more and more powerful. There was just one problem: It was all based on lies.\n\n\u201cA Nation At Risk\u201d freaked out over the fact that SAT scores had gone into a slump after 1968. What it failed to note was that large numbers of minorities and poor whites, who had never even taken the SATs before, were now taking the test for the first time, and lowering the average scores, even though they were actually better-educated than those like them in earlier years. Thus, the fact that millions more students now aspired to go to college than ever before was magically transformed from good news into bad! This profound misreading of the SAT results should have been obvious to anyone, given how increasingly competitive the college admissions process was starting to become. But it wasn\u2019t until the early 1990s that a reexamination of SAT data conducted at Sandia National Labs unveiled the truth.\n\nThe Sandia Report showed that SAT scores had actually improved or held steady for virtually all student subgroups between 1975 and 1988. In broadest terms, white student scores improved modestly, while minority student gains were substantial. What\u2019s more, from 1970 to 1988, the number of 22-year-old Americans with college degrees had increased every year; the U.S. led all developed nations in 1988. Talk about failure! But the Sandia Report was first repressed, then delayed, and finally ignored, because it didn\u2019t serve the purposes of the Reagan/Bush agenda. That\u2019s hardly surprising, given the Reagan/Bush antipathy for facts. But why are Democrats now just as deeply in denial?\n\nWhy the Democrats Fell in Line\n\nTamim Ansary\u2019s concise, incisive historical account of \u201cA Nation at Risk\u201d and the Sandia Report provides some answers, in terms of the larger political dynamics, and how Republicans\u2019 political success impacted Democrats, regardless of anything going on in education itself. First, Ansary notes a constellation of political motivations going into the preparation of \u201cA Nation at Risk,\u201d not least Reagan\u2019s yawning gender gap, but also the growing economic competition led by Germany and Japan. Although Reagan profoundly misrepresented the report\u2019s recommendations when it was first released, he eagerly embraced it for his reelection campaign, thus effectively abandoning the purist conservative stance of trying to eliminate the Department of Education. \u201c[I]n his second run for the presidency, he gave fifty-one speeches calling for tough school reform,\u201d Ansary wrote. \u201cThe \u2018high political payoff,\u2019 [Reagan\u2019s Secretary of Education, Terrell] Bell wrote in his memoir, \u2018stole the education issue from Walter Mondale \u2014 and it cost us nothing.\u2019\u201d Thus, education was the centerpiece of Reagan\u2019s rather successful efforts to neutralize Democrats\u2019 advantage with women, as well as their overall edge on domestic issues.\n\nCutting to the heart of what lay behind this success, Ansary noted, \u201cWhat made \u2018A Nation at Risk\u2019 so useful to Reagan? For one thing, its language echoed the get-tough rhetoric of the growing conservative movement. For another, its diagnosis lent color to the charge that, under liberals, American education had dissolved into a mush of self-esteem classes.\u201d To supplement Ansary\u2019s observation, it justified the adoption of harsh, punitive attitudes in line with conservative ideology \u2014 a shift broadly in line with social historian Michael Katz\u2019s argument in \u201cThe Price of Citizenship,\u201d which documents the Reagan era emergence of a \u201cmaster narrative of policy reform,\u201d which began by shifting focus away from the social problems policies were established to address and onto an alleged \u201ccrisis of numbers and costs,\u201d which could be blamed on morally suspect individuals.\n\nThis combination of electoral success and narrative redefinition created the opportunity for center-right Democrats to join in \u2014 particularly as education professionals were being muscled out. Ansary notes that by the time Bush convened his 1989 education summit at the University of Virginia, \u201cAstonishingly, no teachers, professional educators, cognitive scientists, or learning experts were invited.\u201d Instead, \u201cThe group that met to shape the future of American education consisted entirely of state governors,\u201d one of whom was Bill Clinton:\n\nSchool reform, as formulated by the summit, moved so forcefully onto the nation\u2019s political agenda that, in the 1992 presidential campaign, Bill Clinton had to promise to outtough Bush on education. As president, Clinton steered through Congress a bill called Goals 2000 that largely co-opted the policies that came out of the 1989 Bush summit.\n\nThis dovetails with what Ohanian told me about Clinton\u2019s role in 2011, but another education expert I interviewed then, David Berliner, co-author of \u201cThe Manufactured Crisis: Myths, Fraud, and the Attack on America\u2019s Public Schools,\u201d added an important point about how Clinton inadvertently altered the education narrative.\n\n\u201cWhat Clinton got us to do, and Bush [Jr.] capitalized on it, was focus on the achievement gap,\u201d both between whites and minorities, and between affluent and poor, Berliner told me. Superficially, that sounds like a good thing, but Berliner explained, \u201cThe achievement gap gets you away from thinking about equal educational opportunity, which was the [focus of] the Johnson years.\u201d Johnson was a former teacher, Berliner pointed out, who \u201csaid that a lot of the problem with schools are that kids are poor, they don\u2019t have good food, they don\u2019t have security, there are drugs and crime, and broken families, and high mobility rates, and migration \u2026 That was all input-oriented.\u201d Meaning you look at the kind of resources being provided in order for children to learn.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Like global warming deniers, \"education reformers\" have nothing to lose and everything to gain by sowing confusion", "author": "Paul Rosenberg", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Like global warming deniers, \"education reformers\" have nothing to lose and everything to gain by sowing confusion", "title": "Education \u201creformers\u201d resort to Fox News-style scaremongering", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/04/08/education_reformers_resort_to_fox_news_style_scaremongering/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/02/fox_news_grid.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Like global warming deniers, \"education reformers\" have nothing to lose and everything to gain by sowing confusion", "creator": "@PaulHRosenberg", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/02/fox_news_grid.jpg", "title": "Education \u201creformers\u201d resort to Fox News-style scaremongering", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Education \u201creformers\u201d resort to Fox News-style scaremongering", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Andrew Cuomo, Barack Obama, Charter schools, Editor's Picks, Education Reform, eva moskowitz, Fox News, neoliberalism, pre-kindergarten, The Left", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfafd\"", "article_summary": "(Is it really any surprise that charter schools are more segregated than the public schools they\u2019re trying to replace?)\nIt\u2019s a classic expression of the public universalism of the social democratic vision, epitomized by programs like Medicare, Social Security, the public option and universal public education in general.\n\u201c[I]n his second run for the presidency, he gave fifty-one speeches calling for tough school reform,\u201d Ansary wrote.\nNo one is threatening to destroy charter schools, despite their decidedly lackluster records.\nThat vision stands in contrast to the market-based privatized particularism of neoliberalism, epitomized by welfare reform, voucher-based systems like Obamacare, charter schools and for-profit education."}
