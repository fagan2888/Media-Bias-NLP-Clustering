Liberals should make an aggressive argument for the law\u2019s economic benefits, said Furman, the chairman of Obama\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers, speaking at the Center for American Progress.\n\n\u201cWe can do a whole lot better than, \u2018our policies didn\u2019t hurt the economy while doing all these great things,\u2019\u201d Furman said. \u201cIn fact, they actively helped the economy, and they did it not while doing all these great things, but because of what they did in terms of coverage, in terms of cost and in terms of quality.\u201d\n\nFurman\u2019s argument for the health-care law\u2019s economic benefits boiled down to four main points:\n\n*Healthier workers are more productive workers -- and by expanding coverage, Americans will be healthier, Furman said. He depicted this as a future benefit of the law, and provided no evidence that the health of the U.S. workforce has already improved since the law\u2019s coverage expansions in 2014.\n\n*Workers who are freed to change jobs because they no longer have to worry about retaining health insurance, a phenomenon called \u201cjob-lock,\u201d will have higher lifetime earnings. Furman provided no evidence that job-lock has been reduced under the Affordable Care Act, again depicting this as a future benefit.\n\nEconomic Stimulus?\n\n*Expanded insurance coverage and tax credits provided to middle- and low-income Americans to reduce their insurance premiums have acted as something of an economic stimulus, both increasing demand for health services and freeing up cash to spend on things other than health care. Furman said there is direct evidence of this effect, though it is complicated.\n\nEmployment in the health-care industry accelerated in 2014, corresponding with the Affordable Care Act\u2019s expansions of coverage. Health-care job growth was greater in states that reduced their uninsured populations the most, implying that the employment increase is linked to insurance coverage. Furman said about 130,000 health-care jobs were created nationwide, thanks to the law.\n\n*Finally, Furman credited the Affordable Care Act with helping to reduce the growth of U.S. health-care spending, a claim the Obama administration has made before. Spending grew 3.8 percent in 2009, the year before the law was passed -- 2.5 percentage points slower than in 2007 -- and growth has remained low ever since.\n\nJob Growth\n\nThe Altarum Institute, a nonprofit based in Ann Arbor, Michigan that researches health issues, has found that states that expanded Medicaid, the program for low-income people, didn\u2019t see greater gains in health-care employment last year compared with states that chose not to expand. Charles Roehrig, a vice president at the institute, wrote in an e-mail that Furman\u2019s work may show that states that have expanded insurance coverage the most, whether by Medicaid or private insurance, \u201chave had somewhat faster job growth.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is probably a sound conclusion,\u201d he said.\n\nHard to Parse\n\nEconomists have had difficulty parsing out how much of the slowdown in health-care spending is related to the recession that ended in 2009 and how much results from other elements, including the Affordable Care Act. The reasons for the reduced pace \u201cmay not ever be fully understood,\u201d Furman acknowledged. Nonetheless, he attributes about half a percentage point of the annual decrease to the health law, mainly due to cuts in payments for hospitals and other services through Medicare, the program for the elderly and disabled.\n\nAltarum\u2019s Roehrig said Medicare payment policies \u201ccan claim some credit\u201d for slowing costs in that program but that 60 percent of the broader reduction in health-care spending is connected to the economy.\n\n\u201cMuch of the rest,\u201d he said, is \u201cexplained by some temporary factors not linked to the recession.\u201d\n\nDouglas Holtz-Eakin, a conservative economist who heads the American Action Forum, an advocacy group that opposes the Affordable Care Act, poked holes in Furman\u2019s argument.\n\nU.S. worker productivity isn\u2019t increasing, which would be expected if people are healthier under the Affordable Care Act, he said. The argument that expanded coverage and insurance subsidies increased demand for services \u201cignores where our money comes from,\u201d because those benefits are paid for in part by higher taxes, which reduce economic demand, Holtz-Eakin said.\n\n(A footnote in Furman\u2019s prepared remarks tacitly acknowledges this, saying that \u201cthe effects of the law as a whole could be somewhat smaller.\u201d)\n\n\u2018Just Desperate\u2019\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing about a trillion dollars of new spending, $500 billion in new taxes and $50 billion in regulatory costs that is pro-growth,\u201d Holtz-Eakin said. \u201cTo claim otherwise is just desperate.\u201d\n\nOne area where Furman and Holtz-Eakin are in agreement: the causes of the slowdown in health-care costs aren\u2019t well understood.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know\u201d if the Affordable Care Act helped, Holtz-Eakin said. \u201cThe honest truth.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Alex Wayne", "twitter": {"description": "Obamacare is a boon to the U.S. economy, President Barack Obama\u2019s top economic adviser said in a speech aimed at changing the tone of debate over the Affordable Care Act\u2019s effects, though he offered little direct evidence.", "title": "White House's New Claim: Obamacare Helps U.S. Economy Grow", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-04-02/obamacare-aids-economy-white-house-says-without-much-evidence", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/ip.xjHlYkUvk/v2/-1x-1.jpg", "site": "@business", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-author": "Alex Wayne", "parsely-type": "post", "keywords": "U.S. Economy,Law,Barack H Obama,White House,Jason Furman,Health", "news_keywords": "U.S. Economy,Law,Barack H Obama,White House,Jason Furman,Health", "parsely-link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-04-02/obamacare-aids-economy-white-house-says-without-much-evidence", "parsely-title": "White House's New Claim: Obamacare Helps U.S. Economy Grow", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff0000", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-04-02T19:52:01.854Z", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "description": "Obamacare is a boon to the U.S. economy, President Barack Obama\u2019s top economic adviser said in a speech aimed at changing the tone of debate over the Affordable Care Act\u2019s effects, though he offered little direct evidence.", "parsely-tags": "U.S. Economy,Law,Barack H Obama,White House,Jason Furman,Health,Region: Global,Page: article", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.bwbx.io/business/public/images/favicons/mstile-144x144-bbd2101292.png", "date": "2015-04-02T19:52:01.854Z", "parsely-section": "science-energy", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "og": {"site_name": "Bloomberg.com", "description": "Obamacare is a boon to the U.S. economy, President Barack Obama\u2019s top economic adviser said in a speech aimed at changing the tone of debate over the Affordable Care Act\u2019s effects, though he offered little direct evidence.", "title": "White House's New Claim: Obamacare Helps U.S. Economy Grow", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-04-02/obamacare-aids-economy-white-house-says-without-much-evidence", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/ip.xjHlYkUvk/v2/-1x-1.jpg", "type": "website"}, "fb": {"status": "Obamacare is a boon to the U.S. economy, President Barack Obama\u2019s top economic adviser said in a speech aimed at changing the tone of debate over the Affordable Care Act\u2019s effects, though he offered little direct evidence."}, "parsely-post-id": "NM6W166K50XY01", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "parsely-image-url": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/ip.xjHlYkUvk/v2/-1x-1.jpg"}, "article_summary": "U.S. worker productivity isn\u2019t increasing, which would be expected if people are healthier under the Affordable Care Act, he said.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know\u201d if the Affordable Care Act helped, Holtz-Eakin said.\nFurman provided no evidence that job-lock has been reduced under the Affordable Care Act, again depicting this as a future benefit.\n*Finally, Furman credited the Affordable Care Act with helping to reduce the growth of U.S. health-care spending, a claim the Obama administration has made before.\nAltarum\u2019s Roehrig said Medicare payment policies \u201ccan claim some credit\u201d for slowing costs in that program but that 60 percent of the broader reduction in health-care spending is connected to the economy."}
