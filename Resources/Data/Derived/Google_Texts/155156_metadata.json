Although Catholic dioceses are exempt from the mandate, for example, Catholic non-profits are not.\n\n\"HHS understandably would prefer not to have to explain to this Court how it is that the dioceses of the Catholic Church are entitled to an exemption from the contraceptive mandate while the Little Sisters are not, even though both unquestionably are religious organizations that share the exact same religious objection,\" the brief explains.\n\nBecket Fund attorney Daniel Blomberg told The Christian Post that HHS' actions are equivalent to the agency telling non-profit ministries like Little Sisters and others that they are \"not religious enough to merit First Amendment and RFRA protections.\"\n\n\"That is unprecedented and very dangerous to allow an agency, all by itself, decide who gets to exercise their faith and who doesn't,\" Blomberg stated. \"They don't want to have to face the opponent that, among other things, has not just a RFRA claim but a constitutional claim that HHS is discriminating among religions in a way that violates the religion clauses of the First Amendment.\"\n\nBlomberg added that Title XII already serves as a barometer to determine who deserves religious exemptions, yet HHS has ignored Title XII.\n\n\"Title XII has been around for decades and was established by Congress after a careful consideration,\" Blomberg explained. \"Every one of the ministries that are in front of the Supreme Court right now would be protected.\"\n\n\"We shouldn't have this situation where the government is saying that the Little Sisters of the Poor, the nuns who have sworn obedience to the Pope and have been ministering to the poor for 175 years around the world, that they are not religious enough,\" Blomberg continued. \"The HHS is doing that by ignoring the way that Congress has historically determined who gets protected from religious exemption rules.\"\n\nNow lumped in with the Little Sisters of the Poor case is the petition of the Reaching Souls ministry, an international missionary organization, whose case against the mandate was heard by the Tenth Circuit at the same time as Little Sisters.\n\nBloomberg pointed out that a third party administrator for a health care provider was on the record in the Reaching Souls case as saying that if the government provides the money, the health care provider would provide the contraception and abortion-inducing drugs to the organization's employees and beneficiaries as young as 10 years old.\n\n\"It is in the record in that case, and it is very clear what is going to happen if the government succeeds at forcing these ministries to violate their faith,\" Blomberg said.", "article_metadata": {"Description": "The Becket Fund for Religious Liberty urged the United States Supreme Court on Tuesday to hear the Little Sisters of the Poor's religious freedom case against the intrusive accommodation to the Obamacare contraception mandate, a case the Department of Health and Human Services doesn't want the court to take on.", "Copyright": "2016 Christian Post", "Title": "Nun Too Crazy?
