And I was like, oh wow,\u201d said Purcell. \u201cI crawled up onto the steps. I crawled into the plane. There was no other way for me to get on the plane so I crawled up to the plane.\u201d\n\nThe airline has apologized for the incident, but Purcell says that\u2019s not enough. She wants to make sure nothing like this ever happens again.\n\nThrough the lawsuit, she and her attorney feel they could teach American Airlines a lesson.\n\n\u201cI was humiliated. It was embarrassing to have 50-something people watch you crawl into a plane,\u201d Purcell said.\n\nPurcell, a Farrington High school graduate, has a bone disease that keeps her in a wheelchair. She\u2019s a hip-hop artist who flies all the time and makes requests regularly to have a ramp or a wheelchair lift to help her board the plane.\n\nThis was the first time she had flown American Airlines. She says she let them know ahead of time that she would need a ramp and was shocked when they told her it was too late to do it.\n\n\u201cThere was a ramp right next to the plane and she was like, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s too late,\u2019 so I was like \u2018Okay, so we can\u2019t just, the ramp is right there. Can\u2019t you guys just push it right here so I can get on?\u2019 and she\u2019s like, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Purcell said.\n\nPurcell\u2019s attorney wrote a letter asking for compensation and the airline responded by saying:\n\n\u201cThank you for your letter of demand on behalf of Theresa Purcell. American Airlines will not be issuing any compensation for your client\u2019s injuries claim.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t want to watch your family member crawl on to a plane. I mean, come on, this is America,\u201d Purcell said. \u201cI\u2019m just saying there\u2019s always a way.\u201d\n\nShe still flies, although never again with American Airlines, but says the incident keeps haunting her.\n\n\u201cIs today another time where I have to climb onto an airplane again, where all these people have to watch me embarrass myself again, and I gotta be there, hoping please, I hope I never see these people again?\u201d Purcell said.\n\nThe lawsuit asks for $75,000 in general damages, plus punitive damages.\n\nWe\u2019ve reached out to American Airlines but have not heard back.", "article_metadata": {"description": "One woman was forced to get off her wheelchair and crawl all the way to her seat.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=488276218", "og": {"site_name": "wivb.com", "description": "One woman was forced to get off her wheelchair and crawl all the way to her seat.", "title": "Woman forced to crawl onto American Airlines plane files lawsuit", "url": "http://wivb.com/2015/06/08/woman-forced-to-crawl-onto-american-airlines-plane-files-lawsuit/", "image": {"width": 650, "identifier": "https://lintvwivb.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/wheelchair.png", "height": 365}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "One woman was forced to get off her wheelchair and crawl all the way to her seat.", "creator": "@news4buffalo", "image": {"src": "https://lintvwivb.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/wheelchair.png?w=640"}, "title": "Woman forced to crawl onto American Airlines plane files lawsuit", "site": "news4buffalo", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Buffalo News, Buffalo Weather | WIVB-TV News 4 Buffalo, NY | WIVB.com", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.linmedia.newstouch.wivb", "fb": {"pages": 83900655504}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://wivb.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/f7d9afd22abc1421f3f3acc9bc34faf7?s=16", "application-name": "wivb.com", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/news4buffalo", "published_time": "2015-06-08T19:29:35+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-08T19:33:12+00:00"}, "msvalidate.01": "25404283363C09DE121A55A903F03873", "google-site-verification": "rCC8KvhYhxYynxDuL7C_fyWPtSiu1m13vV8Xe8bufDg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "HONOLULU, HI (KHON) \u2014 A wheelchair-bound woman who was forced to crawl onto a plane officially filed a lawsuit Friday morning against American Airlines.\nThrough the lawsuit, she and her attorney feel they could teach American Airlines a lesson.\n\u201cI\u2019m just saying there\u2019s always a way.\u201dShe still flies, although never again with American Airlines, but says the incident keeps haunting her.\nWe\u2019ve reached out to American Airlines but have not heard back.\nAmerican Airlines will not be issuing any compensation for your client\u2019s injuries claim.\u201d\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t want to watch your family member crawl on to a plane."}
