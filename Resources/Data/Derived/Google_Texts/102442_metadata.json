Contraceptive mandate delay granted\n\nThe Obama administration cannot enforce the Affordable Care Act\u2019s contraception coverage requirements against a Catholic nuns\u2019 order for the time being, if the nuns tell the government they object to providing that coverage, the Supreme Court ruled Friday afternoon.\n\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s action could defuse for the time being a showdown between religious employers and the federal government over the procedures for providing contraceptive coverage to employees of hospitals, nursing homes and other entities run by religious groups.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nIn a one-page order issued by the court without any noted dissent, the justices said that \u2014 at least for now \u2014 the Little Sisters of the Poor did not have to follow the procedure the Obama Administration established for religious groups to escape complying with ACA-related rules requiring that employer-provided coverage include contraceptives.\n\n( PHOTOS: 25 unforgettable Obamacare quotes)\n\nInstead of filling out a government-issued form, the nuns can simply send the Department of Health and Human Services a written notice that the order is a religious organization with \u201creligious objections to providing coverage for contraceptive services.\u201d\n\nThe nuns, who run nursing homes, had refused to fill out the federal exemption form, arguing that doing so would violate their religious beliefs by triggering the provisions of contraceptives by others.\n\nLawyers for the Little Sisters hailed the court\u2019s order and said the nuns will take the option the justices outlined. Their actual appeal of the requirement is pending in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit.\n\n\u201cThis order grants all the protection that the Little Sisters of the Poor and the other organizations in the case need while the courts are deciding their case,\u201d said Kevin Walsh, a University of Richmond Law professor and an attorney for the nuns. \u201cWe are happy to satisfy the condition in the Supreme Court\u2019s order, which is to say something that we have been saying from the beginning of the case and that the government already knows.\u201d\n\nDaniel Blomberg, a Becket Fund attorney also representing the Little Sisters, said the Supreme Court\u2019s requirement to send a note to HHS demonstrates that the government\u2019s form amounts to a \u201cpermission slip\u201d to access to contraception.\n\n\u201cThe Supreme Court saw through it,\u201d Blomberg said. \u201cThey\u2019ve given an example of how it can be done nationwide.\u201d\n\n( PHOTOS: Who\u2019s who on the Supreme Court)\n\nTwo religious health care benefit providers \u2013 Christian Brothers Services and Christian Brothers Employee Benefits Trust \u2013 joined the Little Sisters in their suit. The order applies to them as well, meaning the ruling could extend to more than 400 non-profit organizations.\n\nThe Justice Department issued only a brief response to the order. \u201cAs the order indicates, this injunction applies only to the plaintiffs and is not a ruling on the merits of their case,\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cAnd plaintiffs have always been eligible for an accommodation from the contraceptive coverage requirement.\u201d\n\nSupporters of the contraception coverage requirement said they were not overly concerned that the ruling signals where the court may head if and when the case works its way back to the Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cAlthough [we are] disappointed in this temporary order, the court emphasized that the order \u2018should not be construed as an expression of the court\u2019s views on the merits,\u2019\u201d said Sharon Levin, director of federal reproductive health policy at the National Women\u2019s Law Center. \u201cWe are confident once the merits in this case are fully considered by the 10th Circuit, that it will once again uphold the birth control regulations as it did in December.\u201d\n\nIf the nuns send a notice meeting the Supreme Court\u2019s requirements, the government will be blocked from taking any enforcement action against the religious group at least until a federal appeals court acts on the nuns\u2019 appeal, the court\u2019s order said.\n\nThe justices also said in Friday\u2019s order that the Little Sisters could get relief pending the outcome of their appeal without sending a copy of their opt-out notice to their insurance carrier \u2014 something the religious group said it would not do because of concerns that could also lead to employees receiving contraceptive coverage.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: In Target's wake, companies plot Obamacare path)\n\nLast month, a federal district court judge in Colorado ruled that it would \u201cnot substantially burden\u201d the nuns\u2019 religious beliefs to complete the government form or send it to the firm that administers their insurance.\n\nThe Denver-based 10th Circuit Court refused to stay the nuns\u2019 duty to comply with the regulations, which took effect Jan. 1.\n\nOn New Year\u2019s Eve, Justice Sonia Sotomayor gave the religious order an emergency stay while the court considered how to respond to the group\u2019s application for a stay pending appeal.\n\nThe Supreme Court has not yet agreed to hear the Little Sisters\u2019 case or any other brought by a non-profit religious group challenging the Obamacare contraceptive regulations.\n\nHowever, the justices are scheduled to hear arguments in March in a pair of cases in which for-profit businesses are seeking to escape the coverage requirements because the owners of the firms say providing such coverage would violate their religious beliefs.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "Justices say that \u2014 for now \u2014 the Little Sisters for the Poor did not have to follow the procedure.", "title": "Contraceptive mandate delay granted", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/01/contraceptive-mandate-obamacare-little-sisters-for-the-poor-supreme-court-102587.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2013/11/26/131126_supreme_court_building_ap_605.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Obamacare,Health Care,Supreme Court,Contraception,Affordable Care Act", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "Justices say that \u2014 for now \u2014 the Little Sisters for the Poor did not have to follow the procedure.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde2b7\"", "article_summary": "The Supreme Court has not yet agreed to hear the Little Sisters\u2019 case or any other brought by a non-profit religious group challenging the Obamacare contraceptive regulations.\nContraceptive mandate delay grantedThe Obama administration cannot enforce the Affordable Care Act\u2019s contraception coverage requirements against a Catholic nuns\u2019 order for the time being, if the nuns tell the government they object to providing that coverage, the Supreme Court ruled Friday afternoon.\nLawyers for the Little Sisters hailed the court\u2019s order and said the nuns will take the option the justices outlined.\n\u201cThe Supreme Court saw through it,\u201d Blomberg said.\nOn New Year\u2019s Eve, Justice Sonia Sotomayor gave the religious order an emergency stay while the court considered how to respond to the group\u2019s application for a stay pending appeal."}
