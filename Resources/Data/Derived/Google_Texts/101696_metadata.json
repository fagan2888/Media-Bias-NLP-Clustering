REUTERS/Lucas Jackson\n\n(Reuters Health) - More than 40 percent of a sample of U.S. adults believe the myth that flu vaccines can give you the flu, and even correcting that misconception might not convince them to get the vaccine, a new survey suggests.\n\n\u201cIt is absolutely biologically impossible to get the flu from the vaccine,\u201d said Dr. Gregory A. Poland, a professor of medicine at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, who studies the immunogenetics of vaccine response.\n\nHe was not involved with the new study.\n\nIt seems logical that dispelling this myth would lead to more people getting the shot, but it may not work that way in real life, Poland told Reuters Health by phone.\n\n\u201cThings that seem logical and intuitive can have perverse effects that we don\u2019t always understand or expect,\u201d he said.\n\nThe new results show that teaching patients about the safety and efficacy of the vaccine shouldn\u2019t be \u2018one size fits all,\u2019 he said.\n\n\u201cI think we have to move toward a model where I as a physician have to change my style of educating based on my listening and understanding what your educational needs are,\u201d he said.\n\nIn an online survey in 2012, 1,000 U.S. adults were asked how concerned they were about side effects from the influenza vaccine.\n\nA quarter of people said they were extremely or very concerned.\n\nNext, the 1,000 respondents were randomly divided into three groups. One group got information from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website on the safety of the flu vaccine. The second group received information from the CDC on the danger of the flu itself. The third group did not have any information.\n\nThen the respondents answered questions about whether or not one can get the flu from the vaccine, their belief in the safety of the vaccine, and their intent to get a flu shot in the coming year.\n\nMore than 40 percent of people believed the statement \u201cthe flu vaccine can give you the flu\u201d was at least somewhat accurate, and four percent believed the vaccine was not at all safe, according to results in Vaccine.\n\nIn the group that read CDC information on the safety of the vaccine, fewer people believed it could give you the flu.\n\nBut the group that read about the dangers of the flu still had misperceptions about the flu vaccine, the authors found.\n\nOverall, about a third of participants said they were very unlikely to get a flu shot in the coming year \u2013 and neither information source seemed to affect that intention.\n\nBut when the researchers only considered people who were most concerned about side effects, reading about the safety of the vaccine actually decreased their likelihood of getting it.\n\n\u201cWhen we defend our attitudes or beliefs against challenge we can sometimes back ourselves further into those beliefs,\u201d said the lead author of the new study, Brendan Nyhan.\n\nNyhan, an assistant professor of government at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire, said the study did not look at why certain people would react paradoxically when flu shot myths are debunked.\n\n\u201cNeither intervention had a significant effect on intention to vaccinate, and we probably overestimate how likely messaging is to change people minds about vaccines,\u201d Nyhan told Reuters Health by phone.\n\nReinforcing the message that the flu vaccine does not cause the flu is unlikely to increase vaccinations, and may even be counterproductive, he said.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a matter of focus,\u201d Nyhan said. \u201cWhen someone asks will the flu vaccine give me the flu, of course you should say no,\u201d but leading with myth-debunking may not influence more people to get the shot, he said.\n\nWhereas drugs are rigorously tested and proven effective before they hit the market, public health messaging is often not based on evidence, Nyhan said.\n\n\u201cPeople think of public health messaging as a silver bullet, but people\u2019s minds are a lot harder to change than that,\u201d he said.\n\nThis year, with the seasonal flu vaccine making headlines for potentially being less effective than previous years, is a particularly interesting time to study how we talk about the vaccine, Poland said.\n\n\u201cMost of the flu vaccine this year contains protection from about four different strains of the virus,\u201d Poland said. \u201cAll four will circulate this year, but one of those four strains has mutated.\u201d\n\nIn a few months we will know how much the current vaccine protects from that fourth strain, but even with that caveat, some protection is better than none, he said.\n\n\u201cI would definitely have people get the flu vaccine this year,\u201d he said.\n\nThe flu still kills up to 30,000 Americans each year, primarily the elderly, the very young or those with chronic health problems, he noted.\n\n(By Kathryn Doyle)\n\nSOURCE: http://bit.ly/160CPNu Vaccine, online December 8, 2014.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config":
