Many nominees have been waiting for Senate approval hearings for months. Nine of them have watched a year go by without a vote on whether or not they\u2019ll be named ambassadors.\n\nMany of the countries lacking these diplomatic positions are politically volatile hot spots or key strategic partners. They include Afghanistan, a country with which the U.S. is wrapping up a decade long war, and Mexico, where 10,000 drones have patrolled the border to monitor illegal immigration. India, the largest democracy in the world, which just elected a new and controversial prime minister is also without an ambassador. (Richard Verma, the nominee to the Indian ambassadorship is an employee of the Center for American Progress, with which ThinkProgress is affiliated.) NATO allies including Norway, Hungary, Iceland, Latvia and Slovenia are awaiting ambassadors too.\n\n\u201cThe Senate is trying to use the confirmation process to achieve other objectives,\u201d says Lawrence Korb, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress. \u201cIn other words, they might not be happy with things that the president is doing with Obamacare, for example, or immigration, [or] not raising the defense budget, so this is one way in which they can express their displeasure.\u201d\n\nHe says the backlogged nominees may also be a way for Senate Republicans to push back at Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.), who changed longstanding legislative rules to make it easier to pass such nominations.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bipartisan failure of the Senate,\u201d Bob Silverman, the president of the American Foreign Service Association told McClatchy DC earlier this year. But it\u2019s a more politically complex issue than the sort of party politics that have beleaguered Congress during much of President Barack Obama\u2019s presidency.\n\nThat\u2019s because presidents have historically abided by a \u201c70-30\u201d split for ambassadorial nominations, meaning that 70 percent of nominations ought to be career foreign service diplomats, and 30 percent of them political figures.\n\nPresident Obama has exceeded the framework, according to Silverman\u2019s organization. Since he took office, 64.8 percent of his nominations have been career diplomats and 35.2 of them political. So far in his second term, 41.4 percent of Obama\u2019s ambassadorial picks have been political ones.\n\nOnly two presidents \u2013 Gerald Ford and Ronald Reagan \u2013 have exceeded Obama\u2019s rate of appointing ambassadors with political backgrounds.\n\nNot all of the backlog can be explained by Republican resistance to Democratic appointees, Korb argues.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re also holding up the career people too,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd just because they\u2019re political [nominees] doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re not qualified.\u201d\n\nBut, Korb relents, \u201cObama nominated a couple of people who didn\u2019t deserve to be there.\u201d\n\nOne nominee who\u2019s gotten the president a lot of flack is George Tsunis, the hotel executive who Obama nominated to be the next ambassador to Norway \u2013 even though, as he admitted in a particularly thorny Senate confirmation hearing \u2013 he\u2019s never set foot in the country.\n\nOver the course of the hearing back in February, it became apparent that Tsunis didn\u2019t just lack experience in the Norway, but he isn\u2019t very well-versed in its politics either. He made a major fumble by saying the country had a president. It doesn\u2019t. Norway is headed by a king and prime minister.\n\nTsunis then called one of the country\u2019s most powerful political parties a \u201cfringe element.\u201d\n\nTo this, Senator John McCain retorted, \u201cThe government has denounced them? They\u2019re part of the coalition of the government.\u201d\n\nTsunis, embarrassed, replied, \u201cYou know what? I stand corrected.\u201d\n\nIn an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal, McCain wrote that Obama may have tapped Tsunis for an ambassadorial post because he contributed $1.3 million to the president and fellow Democrats ahead of the 2012 election. The New York Times tracked the amount at just over $751,000.\n\nThe same money trail, McCain noted, could be traced back to Colleen Bell, a soap opera producer, and Noah Mamet, a political consultant, who he said raised $2 million each for Democratic candidates. The two have been appointed to be the ambassadors to Hungary and Argentina, respectively. According to the Times, Bell raised $2.1 million and Mamet raised nearly $1.4 million.\n\n\u201cTo be sure, the practice of nominating political appointees, including wealthy campaign donors, to serve as ambassadors is unobjectionable in principle,\u201d McCain wrote. \u201cIt pre-dates President Obama, and it is certainly true that political appointees have served with distinction in important and challenging foreign assignments, including in the Obama administration.\u201d\n\nAmong those currently mired in the confirmation process, the majority are career diplomats. Only 14 of the 48 \u2013 or exactly 30 percent \u2013 are political appointees.\n\nFive more nominees \u2014 all of them career diplomats \u2014 will be up for voice votes on Tuesday.\n\nKorb thinks more such votes on career diplomats will follow, but he says, getting appointments \u2014 especially political ones \u2014 through the incoming Republican majority Congress won\u2019t be easy.\n\nThe effect on U.S. foreign policy because of the vacant ambassadorships is already being felt.\n\n\u201cYou have several impacts,\u201d Korb says. \u201cOne is symbolic: the country will say, \u2018You don\u2019t really care about us. You don\u2019t even have an ambassador here. How important are we to you?\u2019 and if we need them to work with us at some point, they may not be so happy. The other issue is substantive, [because] you don\u2019t have the most qualified person in their running things.\u201d\n\n\u201cBasically, [it seems] like they\u2019re not concerned about diplomatic relations,\u201d he says of current Senators, noting, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t reflect back on them.\u201d\n\nBut the power struggle at home, Korb says, is dealing a serious blow to America\u2019s image abroad.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Many ambassadorial nominees have watched a year go by without getting a confirmation vote.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "Many ambassadorial nominees have watched a year go by without getting a confirmation vote.", "title": "Why Many Of The World\u2019s \u2018Hot Spots\u2019 Have No U.S. Ambassador", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/world/2014/11/18/3593435/ambassador-nominations/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/ambassadors_map-24-2-UPDATED.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Many ambassadorial nominees have watched a year go by without getting a confirmation vote.", "creator": "@beenishfahmed", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/ambassadors_map-24-2-UPDATED-321x214.png", "title": "Why Many Of The World\u2019s \u2018Hot Spots\u2019 Have No U.S. Ambassador", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-world", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/ambassadors_map-24-2-UPDATED.png", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/ambassadors_map-24-2-UPDATED.png", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-11-18T13:00:39+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/beenishfahmed"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "World Why Many Of The World\u2019s \u2018Hot Spots\u2019 Have No U.S.\nMany of the countries lacking these diplomatic positions are politically volatile hot spots or key strategic partners.\nSince he took office, 64.8 percent of his nominations have been career diplomats and 35.2 of them political.\nPresident Obama has exceeded the framework, according to Silverman\u2019s organization.\nIndia, the largest democracy in the world, which just elected a new and controversial prime minister is also without an ambassador."}
