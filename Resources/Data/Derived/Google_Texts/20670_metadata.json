Researchers at Brown University found that in recent years hundreds of other nursing homes in African American, Hispanic and low-income neighborhoods also went bankrupt.In 1900, the Lemington Home\u2019s new 33-bed facility was built in Pittsburgh\u2019s East Liberty neighborhood. In 1975, the the facility started a senior center, and in 1983, the board of directors purchased a 12-acre site near the top of one of Pittsburgh\u2019s hills and built a three-story, 180-bed skilled nursing home.Over the next 20 years the facility added an 80-unit apartment complex, for independent senior citizens, and a 32 assisted-living residence. At its height, Lemington provided residential care and services for about 250 people and operated a community services division, offering home care and related services to scores of people.Its senior center provided meals, educational and recreational programs. All of these operations and collaborations established Lemington as an important institution, not just in the African American community, but also for the city.The home also partnered with several of Pittsburgh\u2019s institution of higher learning including the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine and historically black colleges.\u201cLemington was a great place. It was important,\u201d said Cora Branson, Lemington\u2019s evening cook. \u201cWe had wonderful people \u2014 teachers, doctors, all kinds of people. We had a former baseball player from the Negro Leagues. We had old-time jazz players come by to give little concerts. We loved the residents and they loved the staff.\u201dSo what happened to this community institution?About 90 percent of Lemington\u2019s residents were Medicaid recipients. The industry\u2019s average, however, is 60 percent, so Lemington\u2019s mission of providing care for low-income people from the area put it at a competitive disadvantage.Lemington\u2019s over-reliance on Medicaid was the principal reason its debt grew from a few hundred thousand dollars in 1984, to more than $10 million, including a $5.5 million mortgage on a new facility in 1984.Pennsylvania\u2019s Medicaid payments for nursing home reimbursement were too low to enable the home to hire enough trained staff. Lemington\u2019s former human resources director, Kevin Jordan, noted that the home was \u201calways scrambling to cover payroll\u201d and spent lots of money on \u201clegal fees fighting the union.\u201dStaff shortages led to health and safety violations, which prompted increased scrutiny by state inspectors. In the three years before it closed, Lemington had 51 visits by inspectors (the requirement is at least one inspection every 15 months) who issued a total of 59 citations for violations. That\u2019s nearly triple the annual average for the state.Too many violations can cause the state to ban further admissions. So when a resident dies or moves, that person\u2019s reimbursement stops and is not replaced, further lowering revenues.In addition, a medical records consultant hired by Lemington found that \u201cthe condition and status of the medical records department is deplorable, drastically disorganized, totally out of compliance and unmanageable and at risk for potential legal liability.\u201dThe failure to maintain clinical records is critical for obtaining reimbursements from Medicare and Medicaid.The state investigation revealed that Carrington, who died at age 73, three weeks after moving into Lemington\u2019s assisted-living wing, only began to receive her medications after her daughter filed a complaint with the state Department of Public Welfare -- and that 13 other residents were not getting their prescribed medications either. The department cited the home for being understaffed and found that its administrator was unqualified.In the wake of Carrington\u2019s death, the state investigation determined that Lemington\u2019s administrator lacked the \u201cqualifications, knowledge and ability to direct staff to perform personal care services as required.\u201dThe board of trustees later learned that the administrator was not working full-time and did not have a designee onsite full-time. That caused a number of problems. In one incident, a diabetic resident stopped breathing and was not revived by staff.Two weeks after Carrington died, Lemington\u2019s board of trustees fired its administrator. Nearly eight months later, in July 2005, the nursing home facility closed.Its remaining 37 residents (down from 180 after years of decline) had to be placed in other nursing homes, which subjected them to \u201ctransfer trauma,\u201d stress that can cause illness or death in frail elders.\u201cEmotionally the transfers were a mess,\u201d said Grady McFarland, a certified nursing assistant who worked at Lemington for 12 years and was president of the local unit of the Service Employees International Union. \u201cThere were people crying at the door as they said good-bye.\u201dLemington cook Cora Branson said the closing of Lemington was like losing family. \u201cIt was heartbreaking to see our residents leave and go different ways. I just couldn\u2019t walk away on that last day. I went up to the third floor and just walked the empty halls.\u201dThe local impact was substantial. More than 100 workers at Lemington were forced to find other jobs, most of them outside of the inner-city East Liberty community. In addition, scores of local businesses that had supplied Lemington with food and other goods and services, suffered lost revenues.Nationally, nonprofit nursing homes watched as a subsequent federal lawsuit by Lemington\u2019s creditors raised concerns about the fiduciary responsibilty of a home\u2019s officers and directors.In bankruptcy proceedings the summer of 2005, the nursing homes\u2019 creditors said Lemington owed them more than $7.4 million. Although their lawyer showed that the nursing home had not submitted $1.2 million claims to Medicare and Medicaid, Lemington\u2019s chief financial officer (CFO) testified that he did not have the funds to hire the specialized (and high salaried) accounting clerk needed to process the complicated government claim forms.The creditors\u2019 lawyer noted that if the CFO had submitted those claims, collected other accounts receivable and used a special $1.4 million allotment from the state, Lemington not only need not have gone bankrupt, but also could have continued operations and even paid down some of its debt.In February 2013, a jury found 15 of the 17 members of the Lemington board, the administrator and the chief financial officer liable on four counts of failure to care for the residents and failure to protect the home\u2019s assets. The jury ordered compensatory and punitive damages totaling $5.7 million.Finally, on Jan. 26 of this year, the Third U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed that both the officers and board had ignored their duty to residents, but only held the administrator and financial officer liable for $1.75 million in damages. The court vacated the lower court\u2019s punitive judgment against five officers--to the tune of $350,000 each, finding no evidence they had engaged in \u201coutrageous conduct.\u201dAlthough the leadership of Lemington Home must bear the responsibility for those legal judgments and the fate of an important institution, the racist history imbedded in Medicaid\u2019s rules for the past 80 years should share the brunt of the blame for bankruptcies at hundreds of long-term care homes largely serving black, Latino and low-income elders.One needed change would be to award nursing homes in African American, Hispanic and low-income neighborhoods serving large numbers of Medicaid recipients larger \u201cdisproportionate share payments.\u201d Under the law, such homes receive additional reimbursements for serving a larger-than-usual proportion of low-income residents.But the higher rate also doesn\u2019t kick in unless a facilty has at least a 90 percent occupancy rate, which many homes like Lemington can\u2019t easily reach. Rules relaxing that standard would bring badly needed revenue to vulnerable homes.Congress could also require that all nursing homes accept a minimum number of Medicaid patients so as to spread the financial burden.But to truly do the job, Medicaid should be federalized\u2014taken out of the hands of state and local officials, many of whom use get-tough rhetoric in elections to stigmatize and punish often-deserving people.Federalizing the program would enable states to lower their taxes since they would no longer have to pay for the largest single item in their budgets. The most efficient and least costly method to accomplish this is the adoption of a single-payer healthcare system.That may seem impossible in the current political climate. Total U.S. healthcare expenditures, however, are again rising and will continue to consume an ever-growing share of the gross domestic product. As the current system for paying those costs \u2014 even with the benefits of the Affordable Care Act \u2014 is increasingly unable to do so, things must change.Medicaid has improved and extended the lives of tens of millions of minorities and low-income people. But the dead hand of racism, institutionalized by the Social Security Act 80 years ago, reaches out to deny them the full benefits of the law, causing many to suffer needlessly during their final days.We may not end racism soon, but 60 years after the Supreme Court\u2019s Brown decision, we ought to be able to eliminate discrimination in the nation\u2019s biggest health insurance program and prevent more nursing home bankruptcies in hard-pressed communities struggling to provide decent care.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "nursing homes, health care racism, black eldercare, medicaid history, black history", "description": "New America Media is a nationwide association of over 3000 ethnic media organizations representing the development of a more inclusive journalism.
