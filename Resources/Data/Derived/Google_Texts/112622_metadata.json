According to textbook neuroscience, they form when neighboring brain cells send chemical communications across the synapses, or junctions, that connect them. Each time a memory is recalled, the connection is reactivated and strengthened. The idea that synapses store memories has dominated neuroscience for more than a century, but a new study by scientists at the University of California, Los Angeles, may fundamentally upend it: instead memories may reside inside brain cells. If supported, the work could have major implications for the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a condition marked by painfully vivid and intrusive memories.\n\nMore than a decade ago scientists began investigating the drug propranolol for the treatment of PTSD. Propranolol was thought to prevent memories from forming by blocking production of proteins required for long-term storage. Unfortunately, the research quickly hit a snag. Unless administered immediately after the traumatic event, the treatment was ineffective. Lately researchers have been crafting a work-around: evidence suggests that when someone recalls a memory, the reactivated connection is not only strengthened but becomes temporarily susceptible to change, a process called memory reconsolidation. Administering propranolol (and perhaps also therapy, electrical stimulation and certain other drugs) during this window can enable scientists to block reconsolidation, wiping out the synapse on the spot.\n\nThe possibility of purging recollections caught the eye of David Glanzman, a neurobiologist at U.C.L.A., who set out to study the process in Aplysia, a sluglike mollusk commonly used in neuroscience research. Glanzman and his team zapped Aplysia with mild electric shocks, creating a memory of the event expressed as new synapses in the brain. The scientists then transferred neurons from the mollusk into a petri dish and chemically triggered the memory of the shocks in them, quickly followed by a dose of propranolol.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A new study challenges more than a century of neuroscience and could radically change the way we treat PTSD", "title": "Memories likely can\u2019t be erased: Research offers new clues to how we remember", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "A new study challenges more than a century of neuroscience and could radically change the way we treat PTSD", "title": "Memories likely can\u2019t be erased: Research offers new clues to how we remember", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/04/04/memories_likely_cant_be_erased_the_truth_about_how_we_remember_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/05/shutterstock_89986468.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A new study challenges more than a century of neuroscience and could radically change the way we treat PTSD", "title": "Memories likely can\u2019t be erased: Research offers new clues to how we remember", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/05/shutterstock_89986468.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Roni Jacobson", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Neuroscience, PTSD, Science, Scientific American, The Scientific American", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2cdc\"", "article_summary": "Topics: Neuroscience, PTSD, Science, Scientific American, The Scientific American, Innovation News, NewsThis article was originally published by Scientific AmericanAs intangible as they may seem, memories have a firm biological basis.\nAccording to textbook neuroscience, they form when neighboring brain cells send chemical communications across the synapses, or junctions, that connect them.\nPropranolol was thought to prevent memories from forming by blocking production of proteins required for long-term storage.\nMore than a decade ago scientists began investigating the drug propranolol for the treatment of PTSD.\nGlanzman and his team zapped Aplysia with mild electric shocks, creating a memory of the event expressed as new synapses in the brain."}
