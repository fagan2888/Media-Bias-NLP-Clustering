An SUV driver died in a fiery crash in South Dallas early Saturday, police said.

The crash occurred about 1:35 a.m. near the intersection of South Lamar and Corinth streets.

A witness told police that a late 1900s model Ford Expedition was speeding on Corinth Street and crashed into a bridge while turning on South Lamar, police said.

The silver-colored SUV burst into flames, and the driver died inside.

Police said they havenâ€™t been able to identify the driver because of his or her burn injuries.
