Hawaii's newest insurer, Family Health Hawaii, paid its CEO and former Insurance Commissioner J.P. Schmidt $109,039 in its first year of operations.\n\nKaiser Permanente Hawaii, the state's largest health-maintenance organization, was the only insurer that reduced its top executive's pay. The HMO paid its regional president Janet Liang $746,538 in 2013, a drop of 26 percent.\n\nTOP EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION\n\n2013 2012\n\nMichael Gold , president/CEO, Hawaii Medical Service Association $1.3M $1.1M\n\nJanet Liang , regional president, Kaiser Permanente Hawaii $746,538 $1M\n\nJohn Henry Felix , chairman/CEO, Hawaii Management Alliance Association\n\n$490,000 $390,000\n\nHoward Lee , president/CEO, University Health Alliance $345,775 $303,883\n\nJohn McComas , CEO, AlohaCare $277,204 $230,084\n\nJ.P Schmidt , CEO, Family Health Hawaii, $109,039 n/a\n\nSource: Hawaii Insurance Division\n\n___\n\n(c)2014 The Honolulu Star-Advertiser\n\nVisit The Honolulu Star-Advertiser at www.staradvertiser.com\n\nDistributed by MCT Information Services\n\nWordcount: 415\n\n[jetpack-related-posts]", "article_metadata": {"description": "Aug. 26-- The Hawaii Medical Service Association boosted compensation for its chief executive Michael Gold by 19 percent to $1.3 million last year as the state's top insurer prepared to roll out Obamacare.
