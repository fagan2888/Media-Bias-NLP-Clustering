And a year ago, it had forecast 13 million ObamaCare enrollees.\n\nA little bit of math shows that sign-ups in 2015 came in 22% below the CBO\u2019s earlier forecast.\n\nAnd that\u2019s not factoring in the many who likely drop out of ObamaCare during the year. (Between September and December last year, enrollment dropped by about 400,000.)\n\nMeanwhile, the CBO still thinks ObamaCare will manage to more than double enrollment in 2016 to 21 million. That already seemed like a stretch, given that it would mean more than doubling enrollment in one year, even though the gain was far less this year.\n\nIt seems even less likely now, given the kind of double-digit rate increases that insurance companies are asking for.\n\nMeasuring ObamaCare\u2019s success is starting to look a little bit like a game of Limbo.\n\nFollow John Merline on Twitter: @IBD_JMerline.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Earlier this year, the Obama administration boasted that well over 11 million people had signed up for an ObamaCare plan by the end of the second open", "og": {"site_name": "Investor's Business Daily", "description": "Earlier this year, the Obama administration boasted that well over 11 million people had signed up for an ObamaCare plan by the end of the second open enrollment period.
