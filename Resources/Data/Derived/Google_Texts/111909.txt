Spearfish, SD

A Spearfish woman was killed Saturday in a single-vehicle rollover crash outside of town.

Twenty-nine-year-old Megan Kellogg was a passenger in the vehicle driven by 32-year-old Justin Kellogg. Just before 3 p.m. Saturday, the pair were traveling south on 104th Avenue five miles northwest of Spearfish when the vehicle left the road and into the east ditch, then got back onto the road. Kellogg overcorrected, and the vehicle rolled. The road they were traveling on was a gravel road.

Both Megan and Justin Kellogg were pinned underneath the vehicle, where Megan died from her injuries. Justin Kellogg was taken to a Rapid City hospital with serious non-life threatening injuries.

Authorities are still investigating, but alcohol and no seat belts are believed to be a factor in the crash.
