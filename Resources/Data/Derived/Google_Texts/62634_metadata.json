But it will also likely determine how women will be able to access a key provision of the Affordable Care Act \u2013 one seeking to guarantee no-cost prescription contraception in most health insurance plans.\n\nThe justices ruling on Sebelius v Hobby Lobby Stores and Conestoga Wood Specialties Corp v Sebelius, expected by the end of this month, will decide whether those companies, and potentially all other for-profit companies, must abide by the so-called contraceptive mandate. It\u2019s a complicated case, so here is some background.\n\nWhat is the contraceptive mandate?\n\nThe health law requires that most insurance plans provide preventive care services without out-of-pocket expense to beneficiaries. The Obama administration included all FDA-approved contraceptives as part of a package of preventive services for women.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInterestingly, for many plans, this was not new. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ruled in 2000 that failure of employer health insurance plans to cover contraceptives was a violation of the 1978 Pregnancy Discrimination Act. But the new mandate extends that coverage to all plans, including those in the individual and small group markets, and it requires that the plans offer a specific array of contraceptive options for no cost.\n\nMore than half the states have their own \u201ccontraceptive equity\u201d laws on the books, many of which include religious exemptions that are similar to ones included in the federal regulation.\n\nWho must comply with the mandate?\n\nMost plans are covered by the mandate, but the federal regulation includes several exceptions. Churches and other strictly religious employers, who primarily employ those of the same faith and whose primary purpose is religious, are exempt from the requirement.\n\nNonprofit, religiously affiliated organizations, such as hospitals and universities, have a separate set of rules. They do not have to provide the contraceptives directly, but must make them available to employees through a third party. Catholic Church officials as well as some others have objected to this requirement. There are at least three dozen court cases challenging those rules still pending, according to the National Women\u2019s Law Center.\n\nFor-profit companies, however, including the plaintiffs in the cases before the Supreme Court now, are not exempt.\n\nThe owners of Hobby Lobby and Conestoga Wood are not Catholic and say they have no problem offering birth control. So what is their challenge to the mandate?\n\nMost forms of artificial contraception are contrary to Catholic teaching. But the Green family, which owns the nationwide craft chain Hobby Lobby, are evangelical Christians. And the Hahn family that owns Pennsylvania cabinet-maker Conestoga Wood Specialties are Mennonites. Both families already offer most forms of birth control as part of their health plans.\n\nThe owners say they are opposed to some forms of birth control \u2013 particularly emergency contraceptives Plan B and Ella, which can be used to prevent pregnancy if taken within 24 hours to as much as five days after unprotected sex \u2013 because these contraceptives prevent a fertilized egg from implanting in a woman\u2019s uterus That is tantamount to a very early abortion, which violates their religion, they argue. The Greens \u2013 but not the Hahns \u2013 also object to two types of intrauterine devices (IUDs) for the same reasons.\n\n\u201cThese abortion-causing pills go against our faith, and our family is now being forced to choose between following the laws of the land that we love or maintaining the religious beliefs that have made our business successful and supported our family and thousands of our employees and their families,\u201d Hobby Lobby founder David Green told reporters on a conference call when the lawsuit was originally filed.\n\nDo those drugs and devices actually cause abortions?\n\nNot according to the vast majority of medical and scientific opinion.\n\n\u201cFederal law and State law \u2013 which do preclude funding for abortions \u2013 don\u2019t consider these particular forms of contraception to be abortion,\u201d said U.S. Solicitor General Donald Verilli during the oral arguments in the case on behalf of the Obama administration. \u201cWe\u2019ve got about 2 million women who rely on the IUD as a method of birth control in this country. I don\u2019t think they are engaged in abortion in doing that.\u201d\n\nThe brief filed by 10 medical groups led by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists noted: \u201cthere is a scientific distinction between a contraceptive and an abortifacient and the scientific record demonstrates that none of the FDA-approved contraceptives covered by the Mandate are abortifacients.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s because the standard medical definition of the start of pregnancy is when a fertilized egg implants in a woman\u2019s uterus, not when sperm and egg first unite.\n\nBut while blocking implantation of a fertilized egg does not fit the medical definition of pregnancy, it does qualify as ending a life for many religious people.\n\n\u201cAs far as the science goes, the FDA has said these four drugs and devices can terminate a human embryo,\u201d said Lori Windham, senior counsel for the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, which has been representing Hobby Lobby. She noted that the labels for the emergency contraceptives and IUDs say they can prevent implantation.\n\nIn the case of one and perhaps both of the emergency contraceptive pills, however, new research suggests they may not work that way at all \u2013 they much more likely simply prevent the fertilization of the egg in the first place.\n\nDoes whether these products cause abortion matter for purposes of this case?\n\nProbably not. At the heart of the case is what the company owners believe, and no one doubts the sincerity of their views. At issue is whether the owners can exercise those religious objections via their corporations under a 1993 law called the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA).

And Jehovah\u2019s\u2019 Witness corporations could demand exclusion of surgical coverage, under the theory that so many of such procedures require the use of whole blood products, forbidden by their faith.\u201d\n\nThe potential for using religion to escape the reach of federal law does not end with health, said Lynn. Corporations could also claim that they do not need to abide by equal pay laws \u201cbecause of male dominance in their scriptural social order,\u201d he said, or, for those who offer public accommodations, \u201cyou can hear them say we don\u2019t believe marriage equality is biblical, so you, (gay and lesbian) travelers, cannot stay in our hotel or eat in our restaurant.\u201d\n\nWindham of the Becket Fund finds all those scenarios far-fetched. \u201cWe\u2019ve had this law on the books for 25 years and none of those cases have happened,\u201d she said.\n\nDuring the arguments before the Supreme Court, Justice Samuel Alito said much the same thing. \u201cIn all the years RFRA has been on the books,\u201d he asked, \u201chas any of these claims involving minimum wage, for example, been brought and have they succeeded?\u201d\n\n\u201cVery few of these claims have been brought,\u201d responded Paul Clement, who argued Hobby Lobby\u2019s case at the high court.\n\nJustice Elena Kagan, however, said if the court upholds Hobby Lobby\u2019s claim, that might change. \u201c[T]hen you would see religious objectors come out of the woodwork with respect to these laws,\u201d she said.\n\n[Image credit: Flickr user NateOne]", "article_metadata": {"description": "One of the most watched cases before the Supreme Court this term will may turn on the question of religious freedom.

Corporations could also claim that they do not need to abide by equal pay laws \u201cbecause of male dominance in their scriptural social order,\u201d he said, or, for those who offer public accommodations, \u201cyou can hear them say we don\u2019t believe marriage equality is biblical, so you, (gay and lesbian) travelers, cannot stay in our hotel or eat in our restaurant.\u201d Windham of the Becket Fund finds all those scenarios far-fetched. \u201cWe\u2019ve had this law on the books for 25 years and none of those cases have happened,\u201d she said.  During the arguments before the Supreme Court, Justice Samuel Alito said much the same thing. \u201cIn all the years RFRA has been on the books,\u201d he asked, \u201chas any of these claims involving minimum wage, for example, been brought and have they succeeded?\u201d \u201cVery few of these claims have been brought,\u201d responded Paul Clement, who argued Hobby Lobby\u2019s case at the high court.  Justice Elena Kagan, however, said if the court upholds Hobby Lobby\u2019s claim, that might change. \u201c[T]hen you would see religious objectors come out of the woodwork with respect to these laws,\u201d she said.
