They found a common theme: Respondents vowed to tackle evidence-based practice after getting patient safety and care quality under control, co-author Lynn Gallagher-Ford told Infection Control Today. That statement indicates a fundamental misunderstanding of the role such practice plays in hospital operations that likely extends to other hospital leaders as well, she said.\n\n\"That's the disconnect--leaders think it is a competing priority when in reality, evidence-based practice is the exact mechanism that needs to be integrated in order to achieve and sustain quality and safety,\" Gallagher-Ford said.\n\nThe Institute of Medicine has set a target for healthcare providers to make 90 percent of their decisions evidence-based by the end of the decade. But Gallagher-Ford told the publication that hospital leaders aren't actually making more progress on the issue.\n\nMelnyk and her team also found a knowledge gap regarding how to measure outcomes, with almost half of respondents telling researchers they were unsure. These statistics are particularly troubling, Melnyk said, because leaders shape a healthcare provider's culture and infrastructure, which means the provider's overall care quality will reflect this lack of knowledge. More than 1 in 3 respondents' organizations did not meet National Database of Nursing Quality Indicators performance metrics, according to the abstract.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- here's the survey abstract\n\n- read the Infection Control Today article\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nEvidence-based practice centers spur healthcare innovation\n\n3 steps healthcare leaders must take to measure care quality\n\nEvidence-based care, culture change reduced sepsis, complications at NJ hospital\n\n24 strategies nurses need for evidence-based care\n\nAHRQ: New functionalities for pediatric EHRs need to be added 'thoughtfully'\n\nNeed better evidence-based design for hospitals?
