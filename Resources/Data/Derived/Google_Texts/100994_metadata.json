Fair enough. Watch the truncated one below, followed by an extended answer \u2014 or, better yet, click here and skip to 23:00 to watch the full, unedited response at the time (it only runs two minutes or so). The truncated clip makes it sound like Rubio is endorsing a cap-and-trade scheme for Florida. Not so:\n\nIn his second ses\u00adsion, Ru\u00adbio played hard\u00adball with Crist. Cli\u00admate change was one of Crist\u2019s sig\u00adna\u00adture is\u00adsues, and he wanted the Le\u00adgis\u00adlature to pass a bill that would lay the ground\u00adwork for a Cali\u00adfor\u00adnia-style cap-and-trade sys\u00adtem to cut car\u00adbon emis\u00adsions. Ru\u00adbio and House con\u00adser\u00advat\u00adives op\u00adposed the idea, but pub\u00adlic sen\u00adti\u00adment was with Crist. The House ul\u00adti\u00admately passed the bill, but Ru\u00adbio\u2019s team in\u00adser\u00adted a pois\u00adon pill that pre\u00adven\u00adted the plan from go\u00ading in\u00adto ef\u00adfect. \u201cI fully cred\u00adit him with the gut\u00adting of the bill,\u201d Gel\u00adber says.\n\nYou\u2019ll see him say in the extended clip that he supports market solutions to the problem, not a government mandate. So why does he also say that he wants Florida\u2019s EPA to design a cap-and-trade scheme? The key comes at the beginning of the first clip, when he says a federal cap-and-trade program is \u201cinevitable.\u201d That wasn\u2019t a crazy thing to believe at the time: In March 2008, when he gave this interview, Obama and McCain both favored the idea. Seven months later, during her VP debate with Joe Biden, none other than Sarah Palin said she was in favor of it too. If I\u2019m understanding him correctly, Rubio\u2019s point here was that Florida needed to be prepared for the new federal rules about carbon by cooking up its own cap-and-trade model now, which it could take down off the shelf and implement if, and only if, the feds finally passed something. Once there was a mandate in place and federal money was available, Florida would have no choice but to play ball. That wasn\u2019t Rubio\u2019s preferred way of tackling the problem, just a pragmatic take on how to be ready for when the new carbon regime was instituted.\n\nIn other words, if you want to punish him for this, you\u2019re on firmer ground punishing him for looking ahead to playing ball with the feds on an expensive new federal program than in focusing instead on drumming up grassroots opposition to stopping it. It\u2019s a bit like saying in late 2009, before ObamaCare had actually passed, that Florida should design its own ObamaCare exchange and be ready to implement it once O-Care was on the books. That was \u2026 not where conservative priorities lay at the time. But that\u2019s unfair to Rubio since it\u2019s not a perfect analogy: As noted, support for a cap-and-trade scheme was bipartisan whereas party divisions over ObamaCare were stark as can be. It wasn\u2019t crazy to think cap-and-trade was a done deal even before legislation had passed; in fact, had Obama focused on that instead of O-Care when he had a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate, we\u2019d have it today. I can imagine Rubio tanking in New Hampshire and beyond, but not because of this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Hmmm.", "title": "Video: Did Rubio say in 2008 that he supports cap-and-trade in Florida?", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2016/01/13/video-did-rubio-say-in-2008-that-he-supports-cap-and-trade-in-florida/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@allahpundit"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-13T19:41:56+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-13T19:22:49+00:00"}, "keywords": "Cap and Trade, carbon tax, Charlie Crist, EPA, rubio,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1878\"", "article_summary": "Video: Did Rubio say in 2008 that he supports cap-and-trade in Florida?\nThe truncated clip makes it sound like Rubio is endorsing a cap-and-trade scheme for Florida.\nSo why does he also say that he wants Florida\u2019s EPA to design a cap-and-trade scheme?\nYou\u2019ll see him say in the extended clip that he supports market solutions to the problem, not a government mandate.\nBut that\u2019s unfair to Rubio since it\u2019s not a perfect analogy: As noted, support for a cap-and-trade scheme was bipartisan whereas party divisions over ObamaCare were stark as can be."}
