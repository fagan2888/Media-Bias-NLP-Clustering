As a starting point, the panelists said, the Secret Service should hire 200 new uniformed officers and 85 special agents.\n\nRelated: Secret Service Incompetence: One of Many Under Obama\n\nThe hiring spree would mark a 4.5 percent increase in the overall workforce of the agency, which currently employs 6,300 individuals, according to Office of Personnel Management data.\n\nSome Republican lawmakers were hesitant to point all the blame at inadequate funding, noting Congress has provided the Secret Service with more than the Obama administration\u2019s request in each of the last two fiscal years. Members of the U.S. Secret Service Protective Mission Panel -- created after a fence jumper gained access to the White House and a slew of additional Secret Service scandals -- agreed the insufficient budget request illustrates the agency\u2019s management failures.\n\nPanelists said the agency should start from scratch with new leadership -- Secret Service Director Julia Pierson resigned in September and Deputy Director A.T. Smith announced this week he is transferring out of the agency -- and with a \u201czero-based\u201d budget to assess its true needs.\n\n\u201cNo organization is perfect,\u201d said Mark Filip, one of the panelists. \u201cIt\u2019s not a weakness to acknowledge there are problems. Accept them and move forward.\u201d\n\nRelated: Secret Service Head Resigns After Multiple Lapses in President's Security\n\nFormer Deputy Attorney General and panelist Thomas Perrelli said the Secret Service must \u201cstart from the beginning\u201d to define its mission and determine the funding required to carry it out. He added that total is likely to increase from current levels, and the 285 suggested new hires might just be a \u201cdown payment\u201d on the number actually needed.\n\nCurrently, the panelists said, Secret Service employees are stretched too thin. The resulting decrease in training and increase in forced overtime has hurt the morale of the agency\u2019s workforce.\n\nThe Secret Service\u2019s uniformed officers spent an average of just 25 minutes in training in fiscal 2013, down significantly from years prior. Officers at other law enforcement agencies spent as much as one-quarter of their time training. In a typical year, the Secret Service offers special agents eight training classes annually; in fiscal years 2012 and 2013 combined, it offered a total of just one class.\n\n\u201cWe all are in agreement the levels are unacceptably low,\u201d said Danielle Gray, another panelist.\n\nRelated: White House Knew of S. Service Prostitution Link\n\nSome lawmakers were unwilling to accept those explanations for the dropping satisfaction of the workforce.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure they\u2019re all nice people,\u201d said Rep. John Duncan, R-Tenn., of Secret Service employees. \u201cBut they have to realize they are very lucky to have their jobs.\u201d He added federal law enforcement officers are higher paid than their local counterparts, who \u201care out there fighting the real crime, the daily, day-to-day crime that everyone wants fought.\u201d Duncan added: \u201cWhen I hear about low morale in the Secret Service, they ought to be ashamed [of themselves].\u201d\n\nRep. Buddy Carter, R-Ga., said Secret Service workers should take their cues from pop culture. \u201cDid these guys not watch the movies?\u201d Carter asked. \u201cThose people are really excited about becoming Secret Service agents.\u201d\n\nOverall, members of the oversight committee expressed bipartisan support for reforming the agency. Chairman Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, said the Secret Service is facing a \u201cvortex of vulnerability,\u201d but voiced optimism he could work with Democrats to plug the gaps.\n\nChaffetz and Rep. Gerry Connolly, D-Va., both supported a move to take currency and counterfeiting out of the Secret Service\u2019s investigatory purview, with the chairman saying they could jointly introduce a bill to that effect soon.\n\nSome of the changes must come internally, lawmakers and panelists agreed. Management must remove a \u201cculture of fear\u201d and improve human resources practices to get the agency back on track, they said. \u201cThis is not just any organization,\u201d said Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y. \u201cThis is U.S. Secret Service. It used to be one of the most respected agencies in our government.\u201d\n\nThis article originally appeared in Government Executive.\n\nRead more at Government Executive:\n\nOversight Leaders Endorse Pay Raise for Feds\n\nHouse Benghazi Probe Has Nothing New Yet\n\nFrustration for Inspectors on Records Access", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "An independent panel investigating the recent failures of the Secret Service told Cong", "title": "Average Secret Service Agent Had Just 25 Minutes of Training in 2013", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/13/Average-Secret-Service-Agent-Had-Just-25-Minutes-Training-2013", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/05122014_Secret_Service_Agent.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/13/Average-Secret-Service-Agent-Had-Just-25-Minutes-Training-2013", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/05122014_Secret_Service_Agent.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "An independent panel investigating the recent failures of the Secret Service told Cong", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Accept them and move forward.\u201dRelated: Secret Service Head Resigns After Multiple Lapses in President's SecurityFormer Deputy Attorney General and panelist Thomas Perrelli said the Secret Service must \u201cstart from the beginning\u201d to define its mission and determine the funding required to carry it out.\nBuddy Carter, R-Ga., said Secret Service workers should take their cues from pop culture.\nThe Secret Service\u2019s uniformed officers spent an average of just 25 minutes in training in fiscal 2013, down significantly from years prior.\nAs a starting point, the panelists said, the Secret Service should hire 200 new uniformed officers and 85 special agents.\nChairman Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, said the Secret Service is facing a \u201cvortex of vulnerability,\u201d but voiced optimism he could work with Democrats to plug the gaps."}
