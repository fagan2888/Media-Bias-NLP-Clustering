He wasn\u2019t disappointed \u2014 Clayman chose a new plan that will save him 50 percent on his premium.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not stupid, but I had no idea what I was doing,\u201d Clayman said. \u201cThis is the least painful thing I\u2019ve done since I came on to Medicare two years ago.\u201d\n\nClayman said he\u2019d done plenty of research on his own, but it wasn\u2019t until his enrollment session with Marcia Meeks that he fully understood his Medicare plan.\n\n\u201cI will be back next year,\u201d he said.\n\nMeeks, director of the West Virginia State Health Insurance Assistance Program and the Senior Medicare Patrol Program, helps dozens of West Virginia seniors enroll in Medicare plans every day from her office in the Bureau of Senior Services, located on the third floor of the mall near the food court. The office has a handful of employees able to help seniors navigate their coverage, and they\u2019re especially busy this time of year \u2014 the nation is in the midst of Medicare open enrollment, which ends Dec. 7.\n\nAccording to Meeks, some of the biggest changes she has seen in Medicare plans this year have to do with pricing \u2014 one common plan saw its premium jump from $44 a month to $117, and another from $35 to $60. Drug coverage on the plans also changes from year to year, and Meeks strongly recommends that seniors revisit their plans during open enrollment to ensure they get the right coverage for the right price.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just so important for them to review their plans during open enrollment so that there are no surprises come January,\u201d she said.\n\nMany seniors may also qualify for one of four programs that assist with out-of-pocket costs, Meeks said. The Part D Extra Help Program, for example, allows individuals with less than $1,471.25 in monthly income or couples with less than $1,991.25 to receive up to $4,700 in Medicare Part D Prescription Assistance per year.\n\nThe Bureau of Senior Services has several programs to help both seniors and younger West Virginians, including a full-time navigator and an in-person assister for anyone trying to enroll in a private health insurance plan on the state\u2019s Affordable Care Act exchange.\n\n\u201cWe have many disabled Medicare recipients who aren\u2019t seniors, and those folks have spouses and children, and so even before the ACA, people would say, \u2018well, my wife needs insurance,\u2019 or \u2018I need insurance for my son.\u2019 They were always coming to us anyway,\u201d Meeks said. \u201cWe have a navigator here every day Monday through Friday to help.\u201d\n\nWV SHIP has more than 80 counselors that are paid employees of the Bureau of Senior Services, the Area Agencies on Aging through the Aging & Disability Resource Centers and county senior centers. Meeks said the agency is busy year-round \u2014 seniors are aging into Medicare all the time, and now, those who turn 26 are eligible to enroll in an ACA-compliant plan with the help of the Bureau\u2019s navigator.\n\nThe WV SHIP program accepts both walk-ins and appointments at the Bureau of Senior Services office. To speak to a Medicare navigator, call 1-877-987-4463.\n\nTo learn more about WV SHIP or to find a SHIP counselor at the county level, visit www.wvship.org.\n\nReach Lydia Nuzum at lydia.nuzum@wvgazettemail.com, 304-348-5189 or follow @lydianuzum on Twitter.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Charleston Gazette-Mail", "title": "Mitch Vingle: Examining the state\u2019s D-I baseball crop", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://www.wvgazettemail.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CH/20160524/GZ020401/160529757/AR/0/AR-160529757.jpg", "url": "http://www.wvgazettemail.com/sports-mitch-vingle/20160524/mitch-vingle-examining-the-states-d-i-baseball-crop", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Charleston Gazette-Mail", "description": "See attached", "creator": "@wvgazettemail", "image": {"src": "http://www.wvgazettemail.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CH/20160524/GZ020401/160529757/AR/0/AR-160529757.jpg"}, "title": "Mitch Vingle: Examining the state\u2019s D-I baseball crop", "site": "@wvgazettemail", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "google-site-verification": "1bw05nOwAmeGwNrWfrMp361tiStYbQbOwqqj_P_-LVA", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/charlestongazettemail"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "dc.title": "Mitch Vingle: Examining the state\u2019s D-I baseball crop"}, "article_summary": "For the last two years, David Clayman found and enrolled in a Medicare plan on his own.\nThe WV SHIP program accepts both walk-ins and appointments at the Bureau of Senior Services office.\nThis year, Clayman, 68, decided to visit the office of the West Virginia Bureau of Senior Services in Charleston\u2019s Town Center Mall during Medicare open enrollment.\nHe wasn\u2019t disappointed \u2014 Clayman chose a new plan that will save him 50 percent on his premium.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just so important for them to review their plans during open enrollment so that there are no surprises come January,\u201d she said."}
