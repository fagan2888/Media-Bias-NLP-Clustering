Now, she and other members of Alaska Pacific University\u2019s elite team are training on a short loop at Kincaid Park covered by a snowmaking system - the same snowmaking system that last winter, as Fritz put it, \u201csaved our butts\u201d when there was nowhere else to ski.\n\nIn Willow, the dog sledding mecca about 70 miles north of Anchorage, musher Lisbet Norris has been taking out smaller teams for the last two years so she can still control them without the deep snow pack needed to hold a hook. To the south, low snow conditions have forced the Kenai National Wildlife Refuge to stay closed to snowmachiners for the last two winters - keeping out two-time Iditarod champion Mitch Seavey, who relies on snowmachines to prepare the refuge trails for dog sledding.\n\nAround southcentral Alaska, the last two winters have posed substantial challenges for those who rely on snow - and especially for the cross-country skiers, mushers and snowmachiners who train and race. On Dec. 24, the snow depth at the National Weather Service\u2019s Anchorage office was just 2 inches - well below the historical average of 9 inches.\n\nClimatologist Rich Thoman, who works for the National Weather Service, said that the last two winters are too short a period to attribute the low-snow conditions to climate change - the winter of 2011-2012, he noted, was Anchorage\u2019s snowiest on record. But he also acknowledged that less snow for the city is consistent with a warming climate.\n\n\u201cIt is always impossible to put a couple of years together and say, \u2018OK, this is climate change,\u2019\u201d Thomas said. \u201cIf we get five of these, then we can start to talk about it.\u201d\n\nIn interviews, several professional skiers, mushers, and snowmachiners said they\u2019re staying focused on their sports rather than dwelling on the meteorological challenges they face.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a musher. I take what comes, one step at a time,\u201d Mitch Seavey said. \u201cThe first time I ran the Iditarod, in 1982, it rained. It was warm. And the snow melted and I had to go train in Nenana. So I don\u2019t know - I hate to extrapolate from the last two years as if it\u2019s some sort of trend or as if it\u2019s the end of the sport. Because I don\u2019t see that.\u201d\n\nBut others acknowledged that the last two years have given them doubts.\n\n\u201cIf it keeps getting worse and worse, something\u2019s going to give,\u201d said Scott Faeo of Wasilla, whose team won the 2,000-mile Iron Dog snowmachine race last year - about 300 miles of which traversed bare ground and ice. \u201cMaybe it would be no more of that race, or they would have to restructure it somehow, to hit somewhere in Alaska where it is good.\u201d\n\nThe last two winters have been especially bad for Anchorage\u2019s snow sports practitioners.\n\nThe 2014-2015 snowfall at the weather service office was just 25 inches. That was the lowest total since at least 1985, one-third of the annual average, and only one of four years in the last three decades in which the weather service has recorded less than 50 inches of snow.\n\nThis year, 22 inches of snow have fallen in Anchorage. All but two inches have melted.\n\nThoman, the climatologist, noted that conditions for snow sports are much better not far from Anchorage, both south in Girdwood and Turnagain Pass and north in the Susitna Valley. At Alyeska Resort, Girdwood\u2019s downhill ski area, \u201cWe are thrilled to have winter back,\u201d said Roberta Carney, a program director for the Mighty Mites, a youth ski training group.\n\n\u201cWe ended last year with white strips and brown in between,\u201d she said. Now, she added, \u201cIt\u2019s amazing. It\u2019s like a completely different winter.\u201d\n\nFor the skiers, mushers, and snowmachiners still facing less snow in Anchorage and elsewhere, there are actually some upsides, several said.\n\nLex Treinen, another Alaska Pacific University cross-country skier, said the short snowmaking loop at Kincaid Park makes it easier to rendezvous with teammates and friends. Seavey says he enjoys seeing different parts of Alaska on the training trips he\u2019s made farther north, rather than the familiar terrain on the Kenai Peninsula where he lives. And Faeo, the snowmachiner, said last year\u2019s \u201cdangerous and crazy\u201d Iron Dog course drew new attention from sponsors.\n\nNorris, the Willow musher, said that attitude is an important part of her sport and there\u2019s \u201cno point complaining about what you can\u2019t change.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe make do with what we have,\u201d she said. \u201cDogs don\u2019t care if they\u2019re running on snow or on ground.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, Norris acknowledged that long-term trends seem to be posing challenges. The Knik area, she said, used to be a \u201cfantastic place to run dogs,\u201d but hasn\u2019t been for more than a decade. This year\u2019s Knik 200 sled dog race was canceled; last year, the course was modified because of weather.\n\nFritz, the cross-country skier, competed on the Anchorage high school circuit a decade ago. Cancellations or postponements of races now appear to be much more frequent, she said. The changes, she added, aren\u2019t just local: In Central Europe, ski races are getting moved or canceled, while organizers of the U.S. cross-country ski championships in Michigan are scrambling to pull off events in January.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to see that and know that maybe the next generation won\u2019t have the opportunity to have a ski career like we\u2019ve had,\u201d Fritz said. \u201cYou almost see our sport dying out.\u201d\n\nTreinen, her teammate, remembers reading newspaper articles 10 years ago about warming temperatures and thinking, \u201cWhat am I doing in this sport?\u201d But he persisted and said he has no complaints about training on the short loop at Kincaid Park.\n\nMaybe, he said, the international climate deal announced in Paris earlier this month could lead to some better snow \u201ckarma.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Seavey, whose son Dallas trains his dogs on a refrigerated treadmill, said he doesn\u2019t follow the \u201cline of logic\u201d that long-term warming poses an existential threat to Alaska\u2019s winters.\n\n\u201cThings have been getting warmer, so when does it go the other way? I don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \u201cWe just take what comes, one day at a time, and take it in stride and enjoy all of it.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Alaska Dispatch News, http://www.adn.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "When the early-season snow melted this winter and left Anchorage's ski trails covered in ice, Lauren Fritz, a professional cross-country skier, went out and bought cleats for her running shoes.
