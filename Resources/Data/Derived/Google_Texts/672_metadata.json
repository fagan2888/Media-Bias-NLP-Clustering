The agency has said crossing that threshold will necessitate a cutback on payments to state and local governments.\n\nThe transit groups said bus cuts that were approved in 2012 have forced transit companies to cut back on service, which they said have negatively impacted transit workers.\n\n\"The massive federal cuts in capital funding for buses are beginning to force systems to shift their precious state and local operating funds to the capital side, creating an influx of service cuts,\" the groups wrote.\n\n\"Between 2008 and 2012, more than 85 percent of transit systems nationwide slashed service or raised fares -- some multiple times -- due to shortages in state and local funds,\" the groups continued. \"Transit systems are being forced to make tough decisions on which routes to cut, and invariably, it\u2019s the worker who relies on the late night bus to get home or the reverse commuter that pays the price\u2026Without question, the lack of adequate dedicated bus capital means systems are using more operating dollars to keep aging fleets on the road.\"", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The groups want Congress to reverse a 2012 decision to cut funding for buses.", "description": "The groups want Congress to reverse a 2012 decision to cut funding for buses.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Keith Laing", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The groups want Congress to reverse a 2012 decision to cut funding for buses.", "title": "Transit groups push for more bus funding in highway bill", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/248498-transit-groups-push-for-more-bus-funding-in-highway-bill", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/batonrougebus03112015getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T03:39-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/248498-transit-groups-push-for-more-bus-funding-in-highway-bill", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "dcterms.date": "2015-07-20T12:40-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Keith Laing", "dcterms.type": "Text", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-20T12:40:37-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00"}, "keywords": "Highway bill, Highway Trust Fund, Gas Tax, MAP-21 Reauthorization,,", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/248498-transit-groups-push-for-more-bus-funding-in-highway-bill", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The groups want Congress to reverse a 2012 decision to cut funding for buses.", "card": "summary", "title": "Transit groups push for more bus funding in highway bill"}, "dcterms.title": "Transit groups push for more bus funding in highway bill"}, "article_summary": "The transit groups said the funding cuts in the 2012 transportation bill have had devastating affects on the bus industry.\nThe transit groups said bus cuts that were approved in 2012 have forced transit companies to cut back on service, which they said have negatively impacted transit workers.\nThe request for more bus funding comes at a time when lawmakers are struggling to come up with a way to pay for a new round of transportation funding.\nThe transit groups, who were organized by the Amalgamated Transit Union (ATU) and Community Transportation Association of America (CTAA), said Congress should reverse a 2012 decision to cut funding for buses in last two-year transportation bill that was approved by lawmakers.\n\"Real safety issues exist, as transit systems struggle to preserve their existing fleets through the use of old parts and creative maintenance departments,\" the letter continued."}
