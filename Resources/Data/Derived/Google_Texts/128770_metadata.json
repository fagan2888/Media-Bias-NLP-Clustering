But if your best player is a (jerk) with his own agenda, forget it.\"\n\nThe Hall of Famer paused on the phone. You could almost picture him making That Face.\n\n\"That\u2019s something that new coaches learn late sometimes \u2014 especially on (the NBA) level,\" he concluded. \"I think David knows that. I hope he does, anyway.\"\n\nWe rang him up to talk about one of his basketball prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, David Blatt, just to hear him give the perfunctory stamp of Princeton approval. He went on as he always does, sounding equal parts mad scientist and basketball Buddha as he discussed the new coach of the Cleveland Cavaliers, but it dovetailed into a treatise about the game itself.\n\nIt strikes you as something that Blatt has heard countless times, but needs to hear again, because he\u2019s entering some unfamiliar territory. Since graduating from Princeton in \u201981 \u2014 his backcourt mate was Knicks GM Steve Mills \u2014 Blatt, 55, has spent his entire coaching career overseas, in Turkey, Russia, Greece, Italy, and then Israel the last four seasons.\n\nSo this is an extraordinary leap of faith by Cleveland GM David Griffin, plucking a guy from the other side of the globe and putting him in charge of an NBA team that has won 31 percent of its games in the four years since LeBron vamoosed.\n\n\"Sometimes you find gold,\" Carril suggested. \"Look at (Gregg) Popovich. He came out of the Air Force and Division 3 when Larry Brown put him on his (1988-89 Spurs) staff. And now he\u2019s won five titles there as the head coach.\n\n\"When you\u2019re allowed to put in things that you believe in, and you have leaders who have an understanding of what you\u2019re trying to do, you fill out the roster with guys who want to follow that leadership.\"\n\nHe hasn\u2019t seen Blatt in a while, but Carril knows he runs the offense he invented (or modified from Red Holzman\u2019s Knicks, as he says). He helped Blatt bring it to Israel some years ago, but they haven\u2019t spoken lately.\n\nStill, Carril knows where the potholes are: \"He knows the game. He knows how to teach it,\" the coach said. \"Now let\u2019s hope he has the kind of guys who understand what he\u2019s selling.\"\n\nBlatt is nothing if not a salesman \u2014 most great coaches are. Does he come on a little strong with self-promotion? Sure. Does he have a peculiar sense of entitlement? Judging by our last conversation about 21 months ago (\"With my personality, I feel I need to be a head coach\"), you bet.\n\nBut he speaks with the theatrical gusto of a faith-healer who is convinced he has been sanctified by some force he can\u2019t explain.\n\nAnd the results are often magical. We saw them as he led the Russian national team to the bronze in London. And this spring provided more proof that there\u2019s something eerie about this coach\u2019s talent for getting teams to believe.\n\nHis success at Maccabi Tel Aviv is known throughout the world, and this season\u2019s run to the Euroleague championship was Hollywood stuff. Blatt\u2019s team barely snuck into the playoffs with an 8-6 record in its group, but it upset an Italian team in the best-of-five first round; shocked CSKA Moscow in the semifinals with a steal and a score with five seconds left; and, then stunned a Real Madrid powerhouse in overtime in the May 18 title game behind Final Four MVP Tyrese Rice, the former Boston College pocket rocket.\n\nAs Mills put it a few years ago, \"David\u2019s skill is bringing people together. It\u2019s a gift.\"\n\nSo here comes Blatt, a product of Framingham, Mass. \u2014 schooled in the most exquisite form of Carrilian chemistry \u2014 who needed 30 years to find his way back home. It\u2019s one of the most fascinating NBA stories we\u2019ve had in a while.\n\nEspecially if the stars align, so to speak.\n\n\"Kyrie Irving is a devastating one-on-one player,\" Carril said of Blatt\u2019s lone star. \"But if you\u2019re trying to build a team, I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s the best way to do it. Again, go back to Popovich: A lot of this is about getting it organized and finding players who complement each other.\n\n\"How many players in Cleveland have those characteristics? I guess we\u2019re going to find out.\"", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "Description": "After more than 30 years overseas, an Israeli-American of international acclaim finally gets his shot at the NBA", "title": "D'Alessandro: New Cavaliers coach David Blatt destined for NBA success, says Princeton mentor Pete Carril", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"D\\u0027Alessandro: New Cavaliers coach David Blatt destined for NBA success, says Princeton mentor Pete Carril \", \"link\": \"http://www.nj.com/ledger-dalessandro/index.ssf/2014/06/dalessandro_new_cavaliers_coach_david_blatt_destined_for_nba_success_says_princeton_mentor_pete_carr.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/ledger-dalessandro/photo/15256682-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"13241887\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-06-21T10:16:21Z\", \"author\": \"Dave D\\u0027Alessandro | Star-Ledger Editorial Board\", \"tags\": [\"@daved\",\"@knicks\",\"@nets\",\"@sports\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.nj.com/ledger-dalessandro/photo/15256682-thumb_square_large.jpg", "description": "After more than 30 years overseas, an Israeli-American of international acclaim finally gets his shot at the NBA", "card": "summary", "site": "@njdotcom"}, "article_date_updated": "Saturday, June 21, 2014, 12:00 PM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"image_url\": \"http://media.nj.com/ledger-dalessandro/photo/israel-us-nba-blatt-3b674f2c894b13ba.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"ddalessa\", \"author_nickname\": \"Dave D\\u0027Alessandro | Star-Ledger Editorial Board\", \"author_id\": \"346\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Sports by Dave D\\u0027Alessandro\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.nj.com/ledger-dalessandro/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "NJ.com", "description": "After more than 30 years overseas, an Israeli-American of international acclaim finally gets his shot at the NBA", "title": "D'Alessandro: New Cavaliers coach David Blatt destined for NBA success, says Princeton mentor Pete Carril", "url": "http://www.nj.com/ledger-dalessandro/index.ssf/2014/06/dalessandro_new_cavaliers_coach_david_blatt_destined_for_nba_success_says_princeton_mentor_pete_carr.html", "image": "http://media.nj.com/design/alpha/img/logo_njo.gif", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "NJ.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Saturday, June 21, 2014,  6:00 AM", "article_author": "Dave D'Alessandro | Star-Ledger Editorial Board"}, "article_summary": "Still, Carril knows where the potholes are: \"He knows the game.\nHe hasn\u2019t seen Blatt in a while, but Carril knows he runs the offense he invented (or modified from Red Holzman\u2019s Knicks, as he says).\nWe rang him up to talk about one of his basketball prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, David Blatt, just to hear him give the perfunctory stamp of Princeton approval.\nIt strikes you as something that Blatt has heard countless times, but needs to hear again, because he\u2019s entering some unfamiliar territory.\n\"But if you\u2019re trying to build a team, I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s the best way to do it."}
