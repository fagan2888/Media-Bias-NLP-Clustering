As the 2016 campaign bids farewell to Ted Cruz, here's a look back on some of his pop culture references and impressions, which always seemed to surprise the people around him. (Nicki DeMarco/The Washington Post)

As the Republican presidential race officially dwindles to only Donald Trump, we say farewell to the only man who was standing in his way, Ted Cruz. (Sorry, John Kasich.)

Even on his last day on the campaign trail, Cruz held steady with his use of random pop culture references and impersonations. Here are a few examples you can find in the video above.

“Back to the Future Part II”

On Tuesday, Cruz said the aggressive villain Biff Tannen was based on Donald Trump.

“The Simpsons”

He impersonated several characters from “The Simpsons” in a Buzzfeed video in June, seemingly trying to connect with younger voters. Most notably, he attempted Mr. Burns’s infamous “excellent,” complete with hand motions.

“The Princess Bride”

After an impromptu reenactment of Billy Crystal’s “mostly dead” scene in November, Cruz would occasionally do an encore performance when asked.

“Star Wars”

It’s no secret how much Cruz loves all the “Star Wars” movies. He first referenced them during his 2013 Senate filibuster of Obamacare and even did an impression of Yoda ahead of the “Force Awakens” premiere.

“Duck Dynasty”

Cruz also mentioned this TV show during his 2013 filibuster, joking that President Obama probably thought a show about a “Southern, God-fearing family of entrepreneurs who love to hunt” was a “horror film.” This reference eventually paid off for Cruz when members of the “Duck Dynasty” family appeared in one of his campaign ads.
