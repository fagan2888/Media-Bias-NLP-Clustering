According to the BEA, Obamacare accounted for about three quarters of the overall rise in Americans\u2019 incomes in January.\n\nPersonal incomes rose by 0.3 percent during the first month of the year \u2014 and the BEA explains that\u2019s partly because of the impact of the health law\u2019s consumer benefits. Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion increased public health insurance benefits by about $19.2 billion. And the new refundable tax credits under health reform, like the subsidies available to help American purchase new plans in Obamacare\u2019s marketplaces, totaled about $14.7 billion.\n\n\u201cPersonal income in January was boosted by several provisions of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which affected government social benefit payments to persons,\u201d the BEA concluded.\n\nThe financial impacts of health reform are most evident among the sectors of the population that are struggling to stay out of poverty. A recent study by the Brookings Institute found that Obamacare has the potential to boost the incomes of the poorest Americans by anywhere from five to seven percent. In order to arrive at that figure, researchers took out-of-pocket medical expenses into account, which can be prohibitively expensive. The rising cost of health care has been squeezing Americans for years, and one in four U.S. families say they struggle to pay their medical bills.\n\nSome researchers are optimistic that Obamacare will eventually be able to protect Americans at all income levels from \u201cfinancial distress,\u201d and lower the rate of people who end up going bankrupt after one catastrophic medical event. At least one study into the health reform law in Massachusetts, which served as the model for Obamacare in many ways, concluded that reform can reduce people\u2019s debt and improve their credit scores.\n\nBut, although Obamacare takes some steps forward in this area, it won\u2019t solve these issues altogether. Researchers who study medical bankruptcies believe they\u2019re ultimately a result of tying health insurance to market concerns, and point out that countries with universal health care systems are the ones that have made the most progress toward eliminating them.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Health reform accounted for about three quarters of the overall rise in Americans' incomes in January.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "Health reform accounted for about three quarters of the overall rise in Americans' incomes in January.", "title": "Obamacare Is Already Helping Boost Americans\u2019 Personal Incomes", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2014/03/05/3363141/obamacare-americans-household-incomes/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/medical-debt.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Health reform accounted for about three quarters of the overall rise in Americans' incomes in January.", "creator": "@Tara_CR", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/medical-debt-321x214.jpg", "title": "Obamacare Is Already Helping Boost Americans\u2019 Personal Incomes", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/medical-debt.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/medical-debt.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-03-05T10:07:35+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/tculpressler"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "Health Obamacare Is Already Helping Boost Americans\u2019 Personal Incomes CREDIT: ShutterstockAccording to a new report from the U.S. Department of Commerce\u2019s Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), the health reform law is having a positive effect on personal incomes and spending.\nAccording to the BEA, Obamacare accounted for about three quarters of the overall rise in Americans\u2019 incomes in January.\nThe financial impacts of health reform are most evident among the sectors of the population that are struggling to stay out of poverty.\nA recent study by the Brookings Institute found that Obamacare has the potential to boost the incomes of the poorest Americans by anywhere from five to seven percent.\nAnd the new refundable tax credits under health reform, like the subsidies available to help American purchase new plans in Obamacare\u2019s marketplaces, totaled about $14.7 billion."}
