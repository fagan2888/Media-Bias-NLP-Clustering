No winning ticket was drawn in Saturday night's record Powerball jackpot of nearly $950 million, which pushes the giant pot even higher \u2014 to an estimated $1.3 billion, according to lottery officials. The next Powerball drawing is Wednesday. Saturday's winning numbers were 16-19-32-34-57 and the Powerball number 13. All six numbers must be correct to win, although the first five can be in any order. The odds to win the largest lottery prize in U.S. history were one in 292.2 million.\n\nMexico says Sean Penn interview helped nab 'El Chapo'\n\nThe recapture of Mexican drug lord Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman took a bizarre twist on Saturday when an interview between Guzman and actor Sean Penn appeared on the website of Rolling Stone magazine. Later Saturday, a Mexican official said the secret interview was the key to security forces locating the world's most-wanted trafficker. The interview purportedly was held at an undisclosed hideout in Mexico in late 2015, several months before Guzman's recapture Friday after six months on the run. In the interview, when asked about high addiction rates, he responds: \"No, that is false, because the day I don't exist, it's not going to decrease in any way at all. Drug trafficking? That's false.\"\n\nU.S. B-52 flight ups ante in nuclear weapons dispute with North Korea\n\nThe U.S. military responded to North Korea's claimed test of a hydrogen bomb on Sunday with a menacing demonstration of its own: a low-level flight by a B-52 bomber over neighboring South Korea. The long-range bomber made a low pass near Osan Air Base, about 40 miles south of Seoul, at about noon local time. It was accompanied by U.S. and South Korean fighter planes, according to a statement from U.S. Pacific Command, in Hawaii. \"This was a demonstration of the ironclad U.S. commitment to our allies in South Korea, in Japan and to the defense of the American homeland,\" Adm. Harry Harris Jr., commander of U.S. Pacific Command, said in the statement released Sunday.\n\nAn American B-52 bomber flies over South Korea on January 10, 2016.

USA TODAY columnist Paul Daugherty calls it the worst loss of the Marvin Lewis era. Leading 16-15 with less than two minutes remaining, the Bengals turned the ball over on a fumble. On the Steelers' final drive, Bengals linebacker Vontaze Burfict was flagged for a personal foul on an incomplete pass from injured Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger. Another personal foul by cornerback Adam Jones set up the game-winning field goal for the Steelers with 14 seconds left.\n\nCincinnati Bengals' Vontaze Burfict (55) runs into Pittsburgh Steelers' Antonio Brown during the second half Sunday. Burfict was called for a penalty on the play.

Refaai Hamo, 55, a native of Syria now living in Detroit, will sit in first lady Michelle Obama's box in the House of Representatives gallery for Tuesday night's speech. Hamo drew international attention last month after he was featured in the popular blog \"Humans of New York.\" Meanwhile, the United Nations is calling for \"unimpeded humanitarian access\" to hard-to-reach sections of Syria besieged by conflict after dramatic photos of starving Syrians went global.\n\nThis undated photo posted on the Local Revolutionary Council in Madaya, which has been verified and is consistent with other AP reporting, shows a starving boy in Madaya, Syria.

John Joe Gray was arrested in 1999 for assaulting a state trooper during a traffic stop. Gray said it was his God-given right to carry the pistol he had that day, without a concealed handgun license. Gray was eventually charged with assaulting a public servant, but he refused to return to court, and instead, armed himself at home. The felony charge of assaulting a peace officer was dismissed in December 2014, when the district attorney left office. But for some reason, no one notified the Henderson County Sheriff's Office or even the Gray family, until now.\n\nHandmade signs on John Joe Gray's property near Trinidad, Texas.
