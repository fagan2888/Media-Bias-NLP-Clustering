The credits are vital to the program.\n\nThe law says that those who purchase coverage through an exchange \u201cestablished by the state\u201d are eligible for the credits. More than two-thirds of the states declined to set up their own exchanges. Currently, residents in 37 states can purchase insurance through HealthCare.gov, the federal exchange.\n\nThe key question for the justices: What is meant by \u201cestablished by the state\u201d?\n\nThe challengers argue that the credits are available only to those who buy coverage through one of the state exchanges, that is, exchanges \u201cestablished by the state.\u201d The Obama administration argues, however, that the language refers not just to the states that have set up their own exchanges, but also to the others, where exchanges are operated by the federal government.\n\nThe Internal Revenue Service, one of the agencies tasked with implementing the health-care law, sided with the administration\u2019s interpretation.\n\nWhen faced with differences over statutory language, the Supreme Court typically looks to one of its own rulings, a 30-year-old matter known colloquially as the \u201cChevron\u201d case.\n\nIn Chevron, the court set up a two-step test to follow when confronting a dispute over an agency\u2019s interpretation of a federal law. First, the court looks to see whether Congress\u2019s intent is clear. If it decides that it is, then the matter is settled \u2013 both the court and the agency shall use that interpretation.\n\nIf it decides, however, that the statute is ambiguous, the court will defer to the agency\u2019s interpretation so long as it\u2019s based on a \u201cpermissible construction of the statute.\u201d\n\nThe challengers in the case argue that the statutory language is perfectly clear: An \u201cexchange established by the state,\u201d is not one established by the federal government.\n\nSupporters of the IRS\u2019s interpretation, on the other hand, argue that an exchange established by the state refers to exchanges set up by either a state or the federal government.\n\nFor support, they point to other sections of the law. One, for instance, allows the federal government to step in and create \u201csuch\u201d an exchange when a state decides not to. That provision, they argue, makes clear that an exchange established by the state is merely an exchange established within a state \u2013 which includes all exchanges.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "The key question for Supreme Court justices who will listen to the latest challenge to the 2010 health care act: What is meant by \u201cestablished by the state\u201d?", "title": "Health-Care Law Arguments: A Big Battle Over Four Words", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2015/03/03/health-care-law-arguments-a-big-battle-over-four-words/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-GX722_HEALTH_P_20150211181658.jpg"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Business", "article.headline": "Health-Care Law Arguments: A Big Battle Over Four Words", "description": "The key question for Supreme Court justices who will listen to the latest challenge to the 2010 health care act: What is meant by \u201cestablished by the state\u201d?", "article_section": "Business", "author": "Ashby Jones", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Law Blog Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Law Blog", "article.summary": "The key question for Supreme Court justices who will listen to the latest challenge to the 2010 health care act: What is meant by \u201cestablished by the state\u201d?", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2015-03-03T16:55:17-05:00", "dj.asn": "10-157", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2015/03/03/health-care-law-arguments-a-big-battle-over-four-words/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-LB-50714", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Business", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "The key question for Supreme Court justices who will listen to the latest challenge to the 2010 health care act: What is meant by \u201cestablished by the state\u201d?", "title": "Health-Care Law Arguments: A Big Battle Over Four Words", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2015/03/03/health-care-law-arguments-a-big-battle-over-four-words/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-GX722_HEALTH_P_20150211181658.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Law Blog", "article.id": "BL-LB-50714", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2015-03-03T16:57:03-05:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca301\"", "article_summary": "In Chevron, the court set up a two-step test to follow when confronting a dispute over an agency\u2019s interpretation of a federal law.\nThe law says that those who purchase coverage through an exchange \u201cestablished by the state\u201d are eligible for the credits.\nThat provision, they argue, makes clear that an exchange established by the state is merely an exchange established within a state \u2013 which includes all exchanges.\nCurrently, residents in 37 states can purchase insurance through HealthCare.gov, the federal exchange.\nThe Internal Revenue Service, one of the agencies tasked with implementing the health-care law, sided with the administration\u2019s interpretation."}
