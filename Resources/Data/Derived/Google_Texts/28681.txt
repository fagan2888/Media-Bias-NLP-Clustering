Thick fog blanketed parts of the South Platte River Basin Sunday, mostly across southern Weld and Morgan counties, but it should be gone by mid-morning, according to the National Weather Service.

Drivers should slow down and be cautious with the reduced visibility, the weather service said.

“It really works on driving speeds when you have got visibility of a quarter mile or less,” said Bob Kaleyla, NWS meteorologist in Boulder.

There is a chance of snow showers in the mountains throughout the day, Kaleyla said.

Clear skies are expected throughout the state on Sunday and Monday, with high temperatures of 34 degrees in Denver on Sunday, climbing to 40 degrees on Monday.

“This is a quiet weather pattern. There is nothing significant until Friday with a chance of snow to the mountains, but it will be light,” Kaleyla said.
