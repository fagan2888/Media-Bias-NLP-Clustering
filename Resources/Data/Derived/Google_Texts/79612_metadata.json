Photo: Jenny Evans\n\nTommy Berry lost one stallion prospect as his Golden Slipper ride when Fighting Sun went amiss, but he\u2019s rusted on to another destined for stud duties in Valentia.\n\nThe $1.35 million Magic Millions sales-topper lived up to his price tag winning the group 2 Skyline Stakes and earning a spot in next month\u2019s Golden Slipper.\n\n\u2018\u2018You always want to see those horses come out and win black-type [races], and it\u2019s exciting where he could go,\u2019\u2019 Coolmore boss Michael Kirwan said. \u2018\u2018We don\u2019t know about the Slipper at the moment, but he\u2019s in it and we know he\u2019s going to be better as the races get further.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe Skyline Stakes has developed a reputation as a stallion-making race with Choisir (2002), Snitzel (2005), Casino Prince (2006) and All American (2008) all on the honour roll since the turn of the century.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile Coolmore will wait until early this week before announcing a decision about Valentia\u2019s Slipper intentions, an hour later they were scratching their heads after $2.4m purchase Wilderness flopped at Bendigo. The David Hayes-trained colt sat three wide, but found little in the straight to finish a well-beaten fourth behind Eloping.\n\nBerry didn\u2019t need convincing about Valentia\u2019s chances in the world\u2019s richest race for two-year-olds. The Fastnet Rock colt will be aiming to become the first horse to win the Skyline Stakes-Golden Slipper double since Dance Hero in 2004.\n\nValentia ($4.20) eased off the heels of stablemate Giuliani ($4) and Gold Force ($2.40 favourite) up the Randwick rise, breezing to a half-length win from Mr Bogart ($26) with Modoc ($12) the same margin further back in third.\n\n\u2018\u2018He feels like he\u2019ll be very impressive in a Slipper,\u2019\u2019 Berry said. \u2018\u2018He\u2019s got the right attitude. He was a lot sharper today and travelled a lot better for me in the run. He\u2019s a lot stronger.\n\n\u2018\u2018The other day he got to the front in the last 50 metres, but you could see today how much sharper he was. He got there in two strides, which I didn\u2019t necessarily want, as I thought the leaders might take me a bit further into it than they did. He\u2019s come a long way from where he was at the start of the prep.\u2019\u2019\n\nValentia didn\u2019t have it all his own way before the race either, overcoming a pre-race drama. He was a victim of the well-backed Time For War\u2019s antics in the barriers, triggering Valentia to burst through the gates before pulling up within 100metres of the start. Time For War was a late scratching after tossing jockey Nash Rawiller and running a crowd-pleasing lap before being captured by the clerk of the course.\n\n\u2018\u2018He was actually quieter when he went back around to the gates the second time compared to the first time,\u2019\u2019 Berry said.\n\nValentia\u2019s trainer, Gai Waterhouse, said: \u2018\u2018He\u2019s quite a lovely-natured horse. With that mess-up he came back around and walked straight in showing what a great temperament he\u2019s got.\u2019\u2019\n\nWhile Valentia has already booked his Slipper ticket, Anthony Cummings will send Mr Bogart to the boys\u2019 version of the last chance saloon in the Pago Pago Stakes. \u2018\u2018He\u2019s just been a bit dumb, but is learning with racing,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018He will be better again in two weeks and if he wins he\u2019ll be great on the back up.\u2019\u2019", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Horseracing", "application-name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "og": {"site_name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "description": "Tommy Berry lost one stallion prospect as his Golden Slipper ride when Fighting Sun went amiss, but he&rsquo;s rusted on to another destined for stud duties in Valentia.", "title": "Skyline Stakes: Valentia overcomes drama to revive Tommy Berry&#8217;s Golden Slipper hopes", "url": "http://www.smh.com.au/sport/horseracing/skyline-stakes-valentia-overcomes-drama-to-revive-tommy-berry8217s-golden-slipper-hopes-20140315-hvj6x.html", "image": "http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/3/4/u/3/w/image.related.articleLeadwide.620x349.hvj6x.png/1394893691493.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/3/4/u/3/w/image.related.articleLeadwide.620x349.hvj6x.png/1394893691493.jpg"}, "title": "Skyline Stakes: Valentia overcomes drama to revive Tommy Berry&#8217;s Golden Slipper hopes", "description": "Tommy Berry lost one stallion prospect as his Golden Slipper ride when Fighting Sun went amiss, but he\u2019s rusted on to another destined for stud duties in Valentia.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@smh"}, "robots": "ACAP allow-present prohibited-modification=annotation", "msapplication-tooltip": "Open The Sydney Morning Herald", "fb": {"app_id": 193677504039845}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.smh.com.au", "msapplication-task": "name=Weather;action-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/weather;icon-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/favicon.ico;", "description": "Tommy Berry lost one stallion prospect as his Golden Slipper ride when Fighting Sun went amiss, but he\u2019s rusted on to another destined for stud duties in ..."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfba0\"", "article_summary": "Skyline StakesGolden opportunity: Tommy Berry and Valentia take out the Skyline Stakes at Randwick.\nThe $1.35 million Magic Millions sales-topper lived up to his price tag winning the group 2 Skyline Stakes and earning a spot in next month\u2019s Golden Slipper.\n\u2018\u2018He feels like he\u2019ll be very impressive in a Slipper,\u2019\u2019 Berry said.\nBerry didn\u2019t need convincing about Valentia\u2019s chances in the world\u2019s richest race for two-year-olds.\nThe Fastnet Rock colt will be aiming to become the first horse to win the Skyline Stakes-Golden Slipper double since Dance Hero in 2004."}
