Authorities believe the same man is responsible for another robbery.\n\nBy From Staff Reports\n\nThousand Oaks police were looking Wednesday for a man suspected of two robberies.\n\nThe first one occurred Friday at a gas station in the 400 block of North Ventu Park Road. Witnesses said a man entered the store, approached the front counter with his hands in his front sweatshirt pocket and told the clerk he had a gun. The man demanded money from the clerk and was handed an undisclosed amount of cash, then fled on foot, authorities said.\n\nPolice said they believe the same man struck a 7-Eleven on Tuesday at 609 Rancho Conejo Blvd. The robber man approached the front counter and demanded money from both cash registers. No weapon was used, but the clerk noticed a bulge in his waistband and believed he had a handgun, authorities said. As the clerk was handing the man money from one of the registers, a customer exited the restroom, which frightened the robber, who left on foot with an undisclosed amount of cash, authorities said.\n\nThe robber was described as 40 to 55 years old, about 5 feet 10 inches tall and weighing 220 pounds. He had a mustache and goatee and black hair and wore jeans and a dark blue sweatshirt with a hood, authorities said.\n\nAnyone with information is urged to call 947-8113.", "article_metadata": {"title": "Thousand Oaks police believe 2 robberies linked", "og": {"url": "http://www.vcstar.com/news/local/conejo-valley/thousand-oaks-police-believe-2-robberies-linked-ep-1277134795-351106981.html", "image": {"width": 359, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/footage1_1442508943503_24120682_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "height": 480}, "type": "article", "description": "Thousand Oaks police were looking for a man on Wednesday suspected of two robberies there.", "title": "Thousand Oaks police believe 2 robberies linked"}, "twitter": {"site": "https://twitter.com/vcstar", "image": "http://media.jrn.com/images/footage1_1442508943503_24120682_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "description": "Thousand Oaks police were looking for a man on Wednesday suspected of two robberies there.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Thousand Oaks police believe 2 robberies linked"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/logo-vcs-icon-144.png", "__sync_contentCategory": "premium", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "SHARE CONTRIBUTED PHOTO Surveillance footage from a Sept. 12 robbery at a gas station along North Ventu Park Road in Newbury Park.\nThe first one occurred Friday at a gas station in the 400 block of North Ventu Park Road.\nBy From Staff ReportsThousand Oaks police were looking Wednesday for a man suspected of two robberies.\nThe robber man approached the front counter and demanded money from both cash registers.\nThe man demanded money from the clerk and was handed an undisclosed amount of cash, then fled on foot, authorities said."}
