YouTube\n\n11-year-old rapper MattyB teamed up with YouTube singer Olivia Kay to make a song for his sister, Sarah, who is living with Down syndrome. The song is aimed at people who look down on Sarah or bully her due to her developmental differences, and urges people to see each other\u2019s \u201ctrue colors.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome people at school might pick on her for her needs,\u201d MattyB, whose full name is Matt Morris, told ABC\u2019s Good Morning America, \u201cbut I don\u2019t think anybody should be bullied because of what they have.\u201d\n\nOne in every 691 children born in the U.S. have Down syndrome, making it the most common genetic condition. Down syndrome is caused by an extra copy of chromosome 21 in the cell\u2019s nucleus. This extra chromosome causes developmental issues and low muscle tone, smaller stature, eyes with an upward slant, and a single crease in the center of the palm. While some people with Down syndrome may have trouble learning and require specialized education, they can go on to live normal, fulfilling lives; some 20 percent of the Down syndrome population in the U.S. work paying jobs.\n\nBut MattyB hopes that his song will convey the message that his sister is just like anyone else aside from a few differences. \u201cSarah is just like any other normal kid,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s an awesome sister.\u201d\n\nSarah, who is something of a YouTube celebrity herself, told GMA that \u201cI can do baseball, or ballets or I like to dance. I do hip hop and I play soccer, and I do batting and I always play goalie.\u201d She\u2019s an active child, who has even rapped some of her brother\u2019s songs.\n\nMattyB and Sarah\u2019s parents helped write the lyrics and produce the video, garnering some criticism that it\u2019s all just to get a larger fan base. But whether or not MattyB is genuine in his new rap song, his message is clear and should be taken to heart:\n\nI keep believing for the day we put our differences aside\n\nAnd let a person be themselves before we cover our eyes\n\nImagine life without the boundaries we create with our pride\n\nAnd opportunities we lose because we judge from inside", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "down syndrome, mattyb raps, mattyb", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "An 11-year-old YouTube rapper wrote a song for his sister with Down Syndrome, aiming to expel negative stereotypes about people with disabilities.", "title": "Fighting Bullies With Words: Kid Raps For Sister With Down Syndrome [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/11-year-old-kid-rapper-mattyb-defends-sister-down-syndrome-bullies-new-song-305342", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/27/mattyb.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "An 11-year-old YouTube rapper wrote a song for his sister with Down Syndrome, aiming to expel negative stereotypes about people with disabilities.", "title": "Fighting Bullies With Words: Kid Raps For Sister With Down Syndrome [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/11-year-old-kid-rapper-mattyb-defends-sister-down-syndrome-bullies-new-song-305342", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/27/mattyb.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/27/mattyb.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-09-27T14:21:12-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-09-27T14:21:11-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "An 11-year-old YouTube rapper wrote a song for his sister with Down Syndrome, aiming to expel negative stereotypes about people with disabilities."}, "article_summary": "11-year-old rapper MattyB is already a YouTube celebrity, but his new song for his sister with Down syndrome is a hit.\nYouTube11-year-old rapper MattyB teamed up with YouTube singer Olivia Kay to make a song for his sister, Sarah, who is living with Down syndrome.\nBut MattyB hopes that his song will convey the message that his sister is just like anyone else aside from a few differences.\n\u201cShe\u2019s an awesome sister.\u201dSarah, who is something of a YouTube celebrity herself, told GMA that \u201cI can do baseball, or ballets or I like to dance.\nMattyB and Sarah\u2019s parents helped write the lyrics and produce the video, garnering some criticism that it\u2019s all just to get a larger fan base."}
