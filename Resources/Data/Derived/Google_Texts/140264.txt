After a week of massive flooding that swamped 17 Colorado counties, the cleanup is in full swing.

Authorities say about 1,500 homes were destroyed and almost 18,000 damaged.

Residents are trying to figure out how and where to dump debris. Thatâ€™s proving to be quite a challenge for Boulder, which was one of the hardest hit areas.
