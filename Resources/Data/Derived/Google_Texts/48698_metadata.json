What\u2019s more, the contract shows that some site components aren\u2019t even due until after March 31 \u2014 the deadline for enrollment.\n\nTech experts say some of the project delays made launching the exchange the equivalent of constructing a building with no blueprint, or going to war with no battle plan. They add that the missed deadlines likely explain why the website has had so many glitches, from randomly appearing error screens to a quirk that prevented at least one consumer from signing up at all if he chose a start date any day after the first of a month.\n\nThe problems have helped hold paid enrollments as of Feb. 1 to just 14,999, or 12.7 percent of the exchange\u2019s first-year goal of 118,000. Consumers, insurers, insurance brokers and doctors have criticized the system for issues ranging from an inability to make payments to in\u00adaccurate provider network lists. Even Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval got involved, telling the Review-Journal on Jan. 29 that \u201cwe hired Xerox to build this system and ensure that it works and right now it\u2019s not.\u201d\n\nExchange officials and Xerox representatives respond that Obamacare required the launch of a website on Oct. 1 that would let consumers shop for and choose insurance coverage, so they met that mandate. They describe working virtually 24-7 to build out the site\u2019s unfinished functions, and they say an im\u00admovable federal deadline made it impossible to put off the launch until after the entire site was ready. But Xerox officials also readily admit they didn\u2019t understand the scope of work that would go into building Nevada Health Link.\n\nThe delayed milestones raise \u201call kinds of giant red flags about how this was managed,\u201d said Miles Feinberg, president and CEO of PayPerCloud, a company that provides cloud-hosting services and infrastructure. \u201cThese are basic fundamentals. This is Software Development 101.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s a basic lesson on what\u2019s missing and what it means for how the website operates:\n\nWHAT\u2019S UNFINISHED\n\nExchange spokesman CJ Bawden said Nevada Health Link\u2019s \u201cfront-end Web portal,\u201d which allows Nevadans to deter\u00admine eligibility for coverage and tax credits, as well as select and pay for a plan, was up and running on Oct. 1.\n\nWhat wasn\u2019t finished was the back end, where Medicaid applications are funneled to the state Division of Welfare and Supportive Services. That part of the website is also where premium invoices are created, enrollment details are sent to insurers and consumers are able to switch coverage if their household or employment conditions change.\n\nFundamental components of the website\u2019s back end were allowed to be delayed when the contract was updated in November.\n\nTake the system test results that validate how well those areas of the website work.\n\nThe original contract, signed in June 2012, said those tests were to be done by July 31, 2013. The amended contract gives Xerox until April 30 to finish the tests, though Bawden said the exchange ran tests with multiple users to be sure the consumer-oriented front end worked before launch.\n\nJennifer Wasmer, a Xerox spokes\u00adwoman, said the company performed \u201cextensive testing\u201d on functions required for the Oct. 1 rollout.\n\nAs for \u201csolutions\u201d for the system\u2019s software and business-operating systems, those were initially due July 1, and were pushed back to April 30 as well.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, the system design document, which lays out a website\u2019s hardware, software, database-management files, security protocols and record-input processes, was scheduled to be delivered by June 30. It was rescheduled for delivery on Jan. 31.\n\nThe contract rewrite reflects that some of the system\u2019s functions were \u201cnot feasible on the original timeline,\u201d Wasmer said.\n\nBesides, it\u2019s common for developers to take a rolling approach with \u201ccomplex technological implementations\u201d such as Nevada Health Link, Wasmer added.\n\nStill, going live without a system design document for a large part of the site would be like building an office tower without a blueprint, Feinberg said.\n\n\u201cJust because you have a design doesn\u2019t mean you won\u2019t have problems, but people do have to know where to build things. Masons need to know where to erect walls, or how they have to build to bear the right load, or where the elevators go,\u201d Feinberg said. \u201cSoftware developers have to know where to build things, too. It\u2019s like a general leading troops: \u2018This is how we do it, this is our plan, follow me.\u2019 Because people don\u2019t just start coding (software) by themselves.\u201d\n\nNot having system test results before April 30 is less troublesome. It could mean site developers haven\u2019t started testing, haven\u2019t completed testing or haven\u2019t \u201ccompiled meaningful results,\u201d Feinberg said.\n\nCraig Greene, a forensic accountant and expert witness on contracts and documents from CPA firm McGovern &Greene, said he noticed another potential concern in the paperwork. The contract shows the same deadline for delivery of the system\u2019s final back-end solution and its test results. That means the exchange and Xerox said they expect to finish building and determine how well it works on April 30.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a little disconcerting,\u201d Greene said.\n\nWasmer said the contract allows delivery of the solution after testing is finished so that Xerox can incorporate changes.\n\nThe amended contract doesn\u2019t merely show project delays. It also hints that Xerox might have underestimated the amount of work involved, and it shows neither party asked for new financial concessions when deadlines were missed.\n\nNO PENALTIES\n\nConsider the tweak in what kind of subcontracting the exchange would allow.\n\nThe state exchange initially required all website work to be done in the United States but later revised the contract to allow work to be done in other countries.\n\n\u201cWhen you read between the lines, it almost sounds like they got into something a little bit larger than they expected,\u201d Greene said.\n\n\u201cThey had to maybe go out and outsource work because they\u2019re not getting it done in a timely fashion.\u201d\n\nAsked if Xerox underestimated the amount of work that would be involved in building Nevada Health Link\u2019s website and call center, Wasmer said: \u201cTo put it bluntly, yes.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe nation\u2019s health insurance exchanges \u2014 like Nevada Health Link \u2014 are unprecedented in their nature and are very complex technical implementations that require high visibility and attention. Both have been given to this project by everyone involved,\u201d she said. \u201cThe team Xerox assembled worked diligently to plan and deliver on time, but the system we used as a base platform for (Affordable Care Act) enhancements required more work than was anticipated.\u201d\n\nNor does the revised contract indicate any added penalties for the delays.\n\nThe initial $72 million contract, signed in June 2012, gives the exchange and Xerox the right to terminate the deal \u201cby mutual consent \u2026 or unilaterally by either party without cause.\u201d\n\nIt also outlines circumstances under which either side can end the agreement for \u201cdefault or breach,\u201d including \u201cif (the) contractor fails to provide or satisfactorily perform any of the conditions, work, deliverables, goods or services called for by this contract within the time requirements specified in this contract or within any granted extension of those time requirements.\u201d\n\nA nine-month delay in a government contract is not unusual, said Jim McGovern, also a forensic accountant and a partner in McGovern &Green. What is abnormal, McGovern said, is that the exchange failed to hold Xerox to delivery dates and apparently never asked for compensation.\n\n\u201cTypically, there\u2019s an adjustment to the contract value,\u201d McGovern said. \u201cIf a contractor says it\u2019s going to perform services by a certain date, and they need more time, often the government asks for some money back.\u201d\n\nBawden said exchange officials decided not to penalize Xerox because the site met its obligations under the law.\n\n\u201cBecause Nevadans were able to determine eligibility, select plans and pay for them on Oct. 1, staff did not feel it was appropriate to charge for liquidated damages,\u201d he said.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean Xerox isn\u2019t feeling the financial heat, Bawden said.\n\nNevada Health Link is paying for website components only after they\u2019re \u201cverified and validated\u201d by an independent, third-party vendor, he said. So Xerox hasn\u2019t been paid for any incomplete back-end functions. The state has so far paid just $10 million of the $72 million contract.\n\nThe exchange also is holding back 7 percent of the contract until the entire project is complete. The hold-back is normally 5 percent, McGovern said.\n\nIn fact, the point of the amended contract was to spell out \u201cappropriate delays of payment to Xerox until the functionality is delivered,\u201d Wasmer said.\n\nXerox is also still in hot water with Sandoval.\n\n\u201cGov. Sandoval has made it clear to Xerox that he intends to hold it fully accountable for the failures of the exchange and that it must build a system that actually works. He intends to make Xerox fulfill its promise to Nevadans and will hold its feet to the fire until it does,\u201d Sandoval spokesman Mac Bybee said Thursday.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just financial considerations that caught McGovern\u2019s eye. It\u2019s also not clear whether the exchange got multiple competitive bids for the job. The paperwork said the state sought proposals and quotes, but the space where the exchange is asked to list at least three other vendors it solicited for proposals is blank, both on the April contract summary and the amended November document.\n\nAlso missing in the amended contract is any explanation of why the exchange agreed to delay parts of the project.\n\n\u201cUsually, you would see something to the effect of, \u2018Here\u2019s why we need the additional time,\u2019 \u201d McGovern said. \u201cI can\u2019t really speculate as to why they would leave that out. It may simply be the fact of this whole insurance exchange and Obamacare being kind of a political nightmare, and all sorts of problems with getting these systems to work. Maybe they simply did not want to put it in writing.\u201d\n\nDelaying the entire launch until the whole website was built was never feasible, Wasmer said.\n\n\u201cThe Xerox team and the state had regular discussions about project schedule and systems or operational readiness. We made joint decisions to comply with the legislatively required due dates, even as they evolved,\u201d she said.\n\nNow that the website is live, what the exchange and Xerox say they\u2019re doing \u2014 patching bugs as they find them \u2014 might be all anyone can do, Feinberg said. Taking Nevada Health Link offline, or finding a new contractor, wouldn\u2019t be good options.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been in the thicket. Sometimes you don\u2019t really have a choice,\u201d Feinberg said. \u201cYou are the custodian of people who are already using your site. I don\u2019t know how you stop it. Hopefully, they have a rescue effort that, unlike the initial launch, is competent. If they do, they can make a plan to get themselves out of the mud and get this repaired.\u201d\n\nContact reporter Jennifer Robison at jrobison@reviewjournal.com.
