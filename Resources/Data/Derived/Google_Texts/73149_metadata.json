The bills all passed with significant bipartisan support, although Democrats repeatedly called for funding throughout the week. Obama administration officials have also called for funding to be added to the packages. Senators who worked on the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act praised the House for moving on the topic, but called for the final bill that will come out of a conference to include many of the provisions that are included in CARA but not in the house bills, such as addressing prescription drug take back programs. For many lawmakers, the legislation gives them an important point to touch on while campaigning. House Republicans Mull Health Reform House Republicans huddled Thursday to discuss the progress members have made on crafting the caucus\u2019s alternative to the Affordable Care Act, and meeting attendees seemed pleased by what they heard. Rep. Fred Upton (R-Mich.) says the group plans to unveil a document outlining the policy ideas next month. Some of the ideas being floated including raising the eligibility age for Medicare, equalizing the tax treatment of individual and employer insurance plans and using per-capita caps to fund Medicaid. Leaders are also interested in enhancing Medicare Advantage. Other priorities are making sure people with pre-existing conditions are covered and that people have continuous health coverage, Upton, who is leading the effort, said. A separate House GOP task force, led by Rep. Brett Guthrie (R-Ky.), is also moving forward with ideas on what types of reforms could be made to Medicaid. The group isn\u2019t planning to unveil legislation this year, but could reform some ideas. Still, how much Republicans can do will depend on the outcomes of the November elections, Guthrie said. And at a House hearing, Republicans and Democrats all discussed ideas to improve the country\u2019s health system. Several Democrats say they want to improve the Affordable Care Act. Obamacare Ruling Gives GOP Big Win A federal judge handed House Republicans a big win in siding with them on a lawsuit against the Obama administration regarding the Affordable Care Act. The administration will appeal the ruling. The district court judge ruled that the administration was unconstitutionally funding cost-sharing subsidies under the law. Unsurprisingly, Republicans praised the ruling, while the administration said they would prevail upon appeal. Most Health Groups Oppose Administration\u2019s Medicare Part B Proposal Most players in Washington\u2019s health care lobbying scene are united against the administration\u2019s Medicare Part B drug payment proposal. Comments on the proposal were due last week. A top Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Official has said the agency would be open to changing it before the final proposal is released. In their comments, several groups say the proposal is a roundabout way to lowering drug costs, although they acknowledge something needs to be done. Several patient and doctors groups say the proposal could affect how patients receive treatment. CMS\u2019 Slavitt Gets All Kinds of Hill Treatment A day after House Republicans on the Energy and Commerce Committee said in a report that CMS Acting Administrator misled them on money the agency had recouped from state-based health exchanges, he testified at a friendly Ways and Means Committee hearing. The Energy and Commerce report suggests committee staffers couldn\u2019t find much of the $200 million CMS Administrator Andy Slavitt had said the administration had recouped from the exchanges. CMS, for their part, says the money has been clearly there all along. The agency has said that it has recouped nearly $300 million, which includes money that had been given to states that opted not to launch their own exchanges. But at the Ways and Means Health Subcommittee hearing, members praised CMS\u2019s proposal to implement the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act, which was signed into law nearly a year ago. One concern they shared was whether the implementation would disproportionately affect small and rural practices, though Slavitt said that would not be the case.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/icons/browserconfig.xml", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "og": {"site_name": "Morning Consult", "description": "Week in Review Opioid Week Wraps Up in the House The House passed 18 bills related to the opioid crisis, and then combined them into one bill as the chamber prepares to go to conference with the Senate.
