He said health insurance is now a \u201cright\u201d in the United States, not a benefit available only to those who can afford it.\n\n\u201cIn the wealthiest nation on Earth, no one should go broke just because they get sick,\u201d Obama told a friendly audience at the college in Largo. \u201cIn the United States, health care is not a privilege for the fortunate few, it is a right.\u201d\n\nObama\u2019s speech reviewed the history of legislation he signed more than three years ago, and offered a preview of the benefits to come when millions of people who previously could not afford health insurance begin buying plans offered within a federal exchange.\n\nEnrollment, which he compared to \u201cbuying a TV on Amazon,\u201d begins online next week.\n\nObama also delivered another warning to congressional Republicans that he will not accept delays to the program\u2019s taxes, mandates and benefits, which GOP House members are seeking to make a condition of raising the debt ceiling next month. He said Republicans \u201chave just spun themselves up over this issue.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe closer we\u2019ve gotten to this date, the more irresponsible people opposed to this law have become,\u201d Obama said, referring to the Oct. 1 start of enrollment.\n\nObama said he would not negotiate delays or other changes to the law as part of budget talks or the debt ceiling process, saying \u201cthe Affordable Care Act is here to stay.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo Congress before this one has ever, ever in history been irresponsible enough to threaten default,\u201d Obama said, calling the tactic an effort to \u201cblackmail a president for concessions.\u201d \u201cI will not negotiate on anything when it comes to the full faith and credit of the United States of America.\u201d\n\nObama spoke without a suit jacket, his sleeves rolled up. And much of the talk featured Obama explaining in the detail of a consumer guide how to enroll in the new plans, which are prohibited from excluding those with pre-existing health conditions.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like booking a hotel or plane ticket,\u201d he said of the plans, which take effect Jan. 1.\n\nHe implored Marylanders to enroll for coverage after the program takes effect next week.\n\n\u201cTell your friends, tell your classmates,\u201d Obama said at the end of his nearly hour-long speech. \u201cWe need you to spread the word. Go to the Web site. See what the questions are. See what the choices are. Make up your own mind.\u201d\n\nObama made the case that the increased competition created by the new marketplace will drive down premiums for many others, part of his larger argument that a fully implemented health-care law will greatly benefit the U.S. economy.\n\n\u201cWhat is it that these Republicans are just so mad about?\u201d he asked.\n\nAnswering his own question, Obama said the opposition is rooted in the wealthy having to pay higher premiums in some cases, the elimination of some tax breaks for deluxe plans and the requirement that businesses with more than 50 workers offer health insurance to employees or pay a penalty.\n\nBut, he said, \u201cit is unfair for people to game the system and have the rest of us pay for it,\u201d arguing that costs will be held down by new health insurance coverage that will help eliminate the need for many to use high-cost emergency rooms as primary care.\n\n\u201cEvery time they have predicted something not working, it\u2019s worked,\u201d he said of predictions that the law cannot be implemented correctly. \u201cPart of why I need your help to make this law work is because so many people out there are working to make it fail.\u201d\n\nHe added later, \u201cIf it actually works, they will look pretty bad.\u201d\n\nU.S. Rep. Donna Edwards (D-Md.), one of a host of Maryland Democrats who also spoke at the event, said she has been uninsured and almost lost her home because of mounting hospital bills, and made a personal plea to young people to enroll. Also attending the event were Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer and U.S. Sen. Ben Cardin.\n\nPrince George\u2019s County was considered an ideal location for Obama to tout his plan. A Democratic stronghold with a large middle-class population, Prince George\u2019s also has a high number of residents who lack health insurance.\n\nAmaris DeNeal, 21, of Forrestville, and Kimberly Thomas, 24, of Seabrook stood about 50 feet away from the president, who appeared on stage before a crowd of nearly 1,000 people packed into a gymnasium.\n\nNeither of the full-time college students has insurance.\n\n\u201cI avoid doctor visits and emergency room visits at all costs,\u201d DeNeal said. \u201cThis will at least give me some coverage to be seen.\u201d\n\nThomas said she has accumulated numerous doctor bills since she was dropped from her parents\u2019 insurance five years ago. She said she uses urgent care facilities in place of a primary care doctor.\n\n\u201cAnything Obama can do to help us to have affordable health care, I\u2019m all for it,\u201d said Thomas, who works part-time as a cashier at a store in a local mall.\n\nAfter Obama\u2019s speech, Thomas and DeNeal said they can\u2019t wait to sign up and tell others about the plan.\n\n\u201cI just think it\u2019s fantastic,\u201d said Mildred Owens, who lives in Baltimore County and volunteers with a group that offers information about the new law. \u201cI know people who don\u2019t have insurance, and I have been sharing with them the same thing the president said today.\u201d\n\nMark Hairston, 37, of Capitol Heights, who is unemployed and uninsured, said he hopes that Obama\u2019s plan goes into effect next week and is not thwarted or delayed by Congress.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something that needs to move forward,\u201d said Hairston, who worked in technical support for a cable company a year ago. \u201cIt would help me.\u201d\n\nObama\u2019s push comes amid lingering public confusion and skepticism over parts of the law, and many congressional Republicans have maintained their opposition after voting dozens of times to repeal or defund the legislation.\n\nIn a statement issued before Obama\u2019s speech, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said that \u201cthe president will try yet again to sell his namesake health-care plan to a skeptical public.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt must be frustrating for him that folks seem to be tuning out all the happy talk,\u201d McConnell said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "President says he won\u2019t negotiate delays or changes to the law as part of budget talks, debt ceiling process.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/ovetta.wiggins", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "President says he won\u2019t negotiate delays or changes to the law as part of budget talks, debt ceiling process.", "title": "Obama defends health-care law, calls coverage \u2018a right\u2019", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/obama-defends-health-care-law-calling-health-insurance-a-right/2013/09/26/9e1d946e-26b8-11e3-b75d-5b7f66349852_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2013/09/26/National-Politics/Images/181919754-7513.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@OvettaWashPost"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/obama-defends-health-care-law-calling-health-insurance-a-right/2013/09/26/9e1d946e-26b8-11e3-b75d-5b7f66349852_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Obamacare, Obam and health care, Obama and debt ceiling, Obama and GOP, Obam and shutdown, Affordable Care Act", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/ovetta.wiggins"}, "news_keywords": "Obamacare, Obam and health care, Obama and debt ceiling, Obama and GOP, Obam and shutdown, Affordable Care Act", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "eomportal-uuid": "9e1d946e-26b8-11e3-b75d-5b7f66349852"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7baa\"", "article_summary": "He said health insurance is now a \u201cright\u201d in the United States, not a benefit available only to those who can afford it.\nA Democratic stronghold with a large middle-class population, Prince George\u2019s also has a high number of residents who lack health insurance.\nPresident Obama offered a ringing defense of his signature health-care law Thursday amid what he called increasingly \u201cirresponsible\u201d Republican tactics to undermine it, ruling out changes as long as he is in office.\n\u201cAnything Obama can do to help us to have affordable health care, I\u2019m all for it,\u201d said Thomas, who works part-time as a cashier at a store in a local mall.\n\u201cEvery time they have predicted something not working, it\u2019s worked,\u201d he said of predictions that the law cannot be implemented correctly."}
