That\u2019s even though the shekel is now at its weakest point in more than two years.\n\nThe bank\u2019s been worried about currency strength for months, and has intervened to the tune of more than $8 billion since 2013 to cool the rise, even considering imposing a cap on the currency, a la Switzerland. The intervention began when Israel stepped up its natural gas production from the large offshore Tamar reserve.\n\nThe increased gas production has boosted the shekel to record-highs against the buck, causing worry over the competiveness of Israel\u2019s exports, a cornerstone of the economy.\n\nThe bank has bought $5.16 billion since the gas-related purchase program began in May, 2013. It has bought an additional $3 billion since mid-2013 in other market intervention. The bank has also used interest rate cuts to rein in the shekel, with the rate currently at a historic low of 0.25%.\n\nAnd don\u2019t expect the intervention to stop anytime soon. The bank plans to continue using foreign currency market intervention to make up for the impact of the natural gas until Israel establishes a sovereign wealth fund later this decade.\n\nDue to the low interest rate, currency purchases, and global surge of the dollar, the shekel has been weakening, and has lost 7% against the dollar since August. On Tuesday, the shekel is trading at ILS3.9663, a level not seen since the summer of 2012.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "The Bank of Israel is on the move again to save the shekel from its own strength.", "title": "Israel Sets Out Spending Plan to Halt Shekel Strength", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2014/12/09/israel-sets-out-the-plan-to-halt-shekel-strength/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-FX947_1209sh_P_20141209070928.jpg"}, "site": "WSJMoneyBeat", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Markets", "article.headline": "Israel Sets Out Spending Plan to Halt Shekel Strength", "description": "The Bank of Israel is on the move again to save the shekel from its own strength.", "article_section": "Markets", "author": "Sara Toth Stub", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "MoneyBeat Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "MoneyBeat", "article.summary": "The Bank of Israel is on the move again to save the shekel from its own strength.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2014-12-09T12:13:05-05:00", "dj.asn": "10-139", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2014/12/09/israel-sets-out-the-plan-to-halt-shekel-strength/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-MBB-30644", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Markets", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "The Bank of Israel is on the move again to save the shekel from its own strength.", "title": "Israel Sets Out Spending Plan to Halt Shekel Strength", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2014/12/09/israel-sets-out-the-plan-to-halt-shekel-strength/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-FX947_1209sh_P_20141209070928.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "MoneyBeat", "article.id": "BL-MBB-30644", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-12-09T12:16:15-05:00"}, "article_summary": "Getty ImagesJERUSALEM \u2013The Bank of Israel is on the move again to save the shekel from its own strength.\nThe intervention began when Israel stepped up its natural gas production from the large offshore Tamar reserve.\nThe increased gas production has boosted the shekel to record-highs against the buck, causing worry over the competiveness of Israel\u2019s exports, a cornerstone of the economy.\nDue to the low interest rate, currency purchases, and global surge of the dollar, the shekel has been weakening, and has lost 7% against the dollar since August.\nThe bank has also used interest rate cuts to rein in the shekel, with the rate currently at a historic low of 0.25%."}
