This unbelievably useless, terrible candidate in Hillary Clinton!\u201d Sullivan asked if she\u2019s ever given a speech that inspired anyone and brought up the lack of retail politics in the campaign.\n\nMaher was lukewarm in his defense saying the Clinton slogan \u201care you ready for Hillary\u201d to be perfect because, like getting a shot, he\u2019s ready, he doesn\u2019t like it, but he\u2019s ready for it. But as Sullivan\u2019s attacks on Clinton deepened so did Maher\u2019s defense at one point blaming the media (both liberal and conservative media) for the constant barrage of general anti-Clinton commentary. \u201cIt\u2019s not that she can\u2019t handle it, it\u2019s that people can\u2019t handle it. People believe what they read, if they ever fuckin\u2019 read.\u201d\n\nSlaughter chimed in saying a lot of the criticism comes from the fact that Clinton is the front runner and presumptive nominee before Sullivan cut her off.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s a talent free hack!\u201d Sullivan said as the audience booed.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s not \u2018talent free,\u2019 Andrew!\u201d Maher exclaimed back. \u201cAnd she\u2019s not a hack!\u201d\n\nSlaughter broke in again giving examples of the work Clinton did at the State Department on the Iran Peace Deal while also speaking up for women globally. But, Sullivan continued, tearing into Clinton\u2019s record as Secretary of State for a \u201cdisastrous Libya invasion which repeated every mistake that George W. Bush made.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"Why do you hate her so much?\" Maher asked Sullivan. \"Were you molested by a real estate lady?!\" VIDEO", "title": "\u201cWere you molested by a real estate lady?\u201d Bill Maher and Andrew Sullivan\u2019s shocking Hillary Clinton clash", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "\"Why do you hate her so much?\" Maher asked Sullivan. \"Were you molested by a real estate lady?!\" VIDEO", "title": "\u201cWere you molested by a real estate lady?\u201d Bill Maher and Andrew Sullivan\u2019s shocking Hillary Clinton clash", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/10/10/were_you_molested_by_a_real_estate_lady_bill_maher_and_andrew_sullivans_shocking_hillary_clinton_clash/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/10/Screen-Shot-2015-10-10-at-3.57.34-AM.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"Why do you hate her so much?\" Maher asked Sullivan. \"Were you molested by a real estate lady?!\" VIDEO", "title": "\u201cWere you molested by a real estate lady?\u201d Bill Maher and Andrew Sullivan\u2019s shocking Hillary Clinton clash", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/10/Screen-Shot-2015-10-10-at-3.57.34-AM.png", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Sarah Burris", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 2016 Democratic primary, 2016 election, Andrew Sullivan, Anne-Marie Slaughter, aol_on, Bill Maher, Hillary Clinton, Hillary Clinton Email, Libya, Real Time with Bill Maher", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd63a\"", "article_summary": "Topics: 2016 Democratic primary, 2016 election, Andrew Sullivan, Anne-Marie Slaughter, aol_on, Bill Maher, Hillary Clinton, Hillary Clinton Email, Libya, Real Time with Bill Maher, Elections News, News, Politics NewsFriday night\u2019s Real Time with Bill Maher turned combative when Maher and conservative blogger Andrew Sullivan argued over their degrees of annoyance with Hillary Clinton while Matchbox 20 lead Rob Thomas, and New America Foundation CEO Anne-Marie Slaughter defended Clinton and blaming campaign flaws.\nThis unbelievably useless, terrible candidate in Hillary Clinton!\u201d Sullivan asked if she\u2019s ever given a speech that inspired anyone and brought up the lack of retail politics in the campaign.\n\u201cShe\u2019s not \u2018talent free,\u2019 Andrew!\u201d Maher exclaimed back.\nConservative Sullivan interrupted a conversation about Ben Carson\u2019s strange media week of blaming the Oregon shooting victims to ask, \u201cWho\u2019s up against this guy?\nBut as Sullivan\u2019s attacks on Clinton deepened so did Maher\u2019s defense at one point blaming the media (both liberal and conservative media) for the constant barrage of general anti-Clinton commentary."}
