A group of 71 GOP House members has jumped into a growing controversy over proposed new dietary guidelines for Americans released earlier this year by a USDA advisory committee.\n\nRepublicans voiced concerns about the panel, known as the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee, in a March 31 letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell and USDA Secretary Tom Vilsack, calling the committee's suggestions \"conflicting.\"\n\n\"We are disappointed with reports from observers that the approach of the 2015 DGAC suggests studies were either selected or excluded to support pre-determined conclusions,\" the lawmakers wrote. \"For example, the DGAC's recommendation on lean red meat directly contradicts years of peer reviewed scientific research on the benefits of lean red meat as a high quality source of protein in an healthy diet.\"\n\nRep. Tim Huelskamp, one of the letter's co-signers, took to Twitter Wednesday to call the guidelines an attack on his meat-producing state.\n\nWhere\u2019s the beef? An attack on #redmeat is an attack on the meat state of Kansas. http://t.co/QmDIPzrcPH \u2014 Cong. Tim Huelskamp (@CongHuelskamp) April 8, 2015\n\nIn its report , the DGAC calls for emphasizing an American diet less dependent on meat \u2014 in part because of meat production's impact on the environment.\n\nEnvironmental groups have cheered the proposal, which has not been officially adopted by the USDA. But cattle producers and lawmakers from agribusiness states are pushing back, criticizing the guidelines as the latest attempt by the administration to use federal agencies to push the president's political agenda.\n\nOther Republicans signing on to the letter include Missouri's Vicky Hartzler, Indiana's Jackie Walorski and Texas' K. Michael Conaway.\n\nThe House letter follows a similar letter signed by 30 senators, mostly Republicans, sent earlier in March.\n\nRelated: Huelskamp on the GOP Conference's Relationship With Boehner McCarthy Offers Glimpse of GOP\u2019s 2015 Priority: \u2018Government Reform\u2019 Monday Night\u2019s IRS Hearing Gets a Big GOP Drumroll Ohio Democrat Pushes Healthy Eating as Fiscal Issue The 114th: CQ Roll Call's Guide to the New Congress Get breaking news alerts and more from Roll Call in your inbox or on your iPhone.", "article_metadata": {"description": "From the IRS  to the Environmental Protection Agency to the Federal Communications Commission, federal agencies are under more scrutiny from congressional Republicans concerned about regulatory overreach than at any time in Barack Obama's presidency.", "og": {"site_name": "Roll Call", "description": "From the IRS  to the Environmental Protection Agency to the Federal Communications Commission, federal agencies are under more scrutiny from congressional Republicans concerned about regulatory overreach than at any time in Barack Obama's presidency.", "title": "Conservatives Find Political Red Meat in USDA Diet Guidelines", "url": "http://www.rollcall.com/news/home/usda-meat-guidelines-conseervatives", "image": {"type": "image/png"}, "updated_time": "2015-04-10T12:47:18Z", "type": "website"}, "abstract": "From the IRS  to the Environmental Protection Agency to the Federal Communications Commission, federal agencies are under more scrutiny from congressional Republicans concerned about regulatory overreach than at any time in Barack Obama's presidency.", "fb": {"app_id": 1383531991672364}, "keywords": "Blog ID,Author,author,category,category,category,category,farm-bill,gop-brand,republicans-2,uncategorized", "article": {"section": "home", "published_time": "2015-04-10T12:47:18Z", "modified_time": "2015-04-10T12:47:18Z"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.rollcall.com/news/home/usda-meat-guidelines-conseervatives", "title": "Conservatives Find Political Red Meat in USDA Diet Guidelines", "description": "From the IRS  to the Environmental Protection Agency to the Federal Communications Commission, federal agencies are under more scrutiny from congressional Republicans concerned about regulatory over", "card": "summary |player (See: https://dev.twitter.com/cards/types/player We will have to submit a test and get approval before using this type)", "site": "@rollcall"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "Tim Huelskamp (@CongHuelskamp) April 8, 2015In its report , the DGAC calls for emphasizing an American diet less dependent on meat \u2014 in part because of meat production's impact on the environment.\nRep.
