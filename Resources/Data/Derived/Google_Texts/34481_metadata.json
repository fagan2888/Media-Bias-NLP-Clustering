In fact, a 2010 email said the \u201cprimary\u201d purpose of the license-plate program was asset forfeiture.\n\nHowever, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are not impressed:\n\nThe lawmakers, Sens. Charles Grassley (R., Iowa) and Patrick Leahy (D., Vt.), said the DEA\u2019s database raises privacy concerns.\n\n\u201cWe appreciate that all of these new technologies are potentially useful law enforcement tools,\u2019\u2019 the lawmakers wrote, but added that technology that scoops up lots of data from innocent Americans raises serious questions.\n\nAnd sites local and national, consumer and tech, left and right are expressing concern. This paragraph from the ACLU is typical:\n\nAutomatic license plate readers must not be used to collect information on lawful activity \u2014 whether it be peacefully assembling for lawful purposes, or driving on the nation\u2019s highways. Without strong regulations and greater transparency, this new technology will only increase the threat of illegitimate government surveillance.\n\nIn fact, legislative proposals in Utah to restrict the practice likely had a part in the DEA withdrawing a request to set up such readers on Interstate 15.\n\n\u201cThe clear winner for most privacy-protective state is Utah,\u201d the post says. \u201cWhich not only provides privacy protections against government abuse of location tracking, electronic communications content, automatic license plate readers, and drones, but also for electronic data.\u201d\n\nIn 2015 America, widespread united public suspicion of these tactics may seem natural, but what I find striking is how much of a contrast this is, not just from the days of my youth, but to the recent past.\n\nTurn on any of the classic series on networks like MeTV and you\u2019ll notice a respect for authority, both police and government. Watch a season or two of Daniel Boone constantly urging friends accused of crimes to trust the system rather than running. Watch Perry Mason trusting the police he opposes in court and how the rural Sheriff Andy Taylor is portrayed.\n\nWith the rise of the left in the later Johnson years, pop culture proclaimed distrust of institutions and Richard Nixon did his best to prove them right. The slightest suggestion of the use of the IRS against his foes caused the people who elected him in a landslide to abandon him.\n\nWith Watergate, the media joined the pop culture in promoting suspicion of the government, but the prosperity and optimism of the Reagan Years kept America\u2019s basic trust in institutions in place. The 9/11 attacks altered the media narrative of distrust in the police, military, and government; ignoring decades of media and culture suggestion, Congress backed the Patriot Act, giving the government new powers to deal with the Islamic terror threat.\n\nBut the memory of 9/11 soon faded and the small government libertarians who consistently warned against government and police authority were joined by the left en masse who, despite years producing movies, TV and film attacking the administration, despite news shows daily pillorying George W. Bush as a liar and fool, and despite gathering without hindrance to protest in large numbers for years, insisted to all who would listen that George Bush\u2019s government was using its new powers to repress dissent.\n\nAll argued without the slightest bit of irony.\n\nEven so, as Barack Obama took power, the basic trust of the people that the authorities would not misuse the power granted them remained.\n\nThen came the Obama administration\u2019s use of the IRS against the tea party, the spying on reporters, the lies concerning Obamacare, Fast and Furious and Gunwalking, the spy revelation on allies and a Justice Department willing to use their powers to inflame situations to their political advantage in Florida and St Louis while finding no interest in groups like the New Black Panthers in Philly and racial incidents in cities like Memphis and Lansing.\n\nAnd now the federal government plans to take control of the internet with new FCC regulations. Yes, the same government that spies on you online is also going to regulate internet service providers as if they were providing a 20th century-style utility.\n\nThe FCC is voting Thursday to give itself such authority to implement net neutrality, which they claim they can do under a law that dates back to the 1930s.\n\nCan we really trust the government that spies on us, both online and off, to also be fair in how it regulates the internet? Yet again President Obama is looking at using regulations and executive actions to achieve his goals, instead of working with Congress.\n\nGeorge Bush may have said he was a \u201cuniter and not a divider,\u201d but in the end Barack Obama has managed to unite people in distrust of the authorities in a way George Bush and over 30 years of cultural persuasion has not.\n\nI suspect it will take a lot longer for authorities to win back the people\u2019s trust than it did for this administration to squander it.\n\nThis article was written by a contributor of Watchdog Arena, Franklin Center\u2019s network of writers, bloggers, and citizen journalists.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Through net neutrality, the same government that spies on you online is also going to regulate internet service providers.", "title": "License plate readers, net neutrality, and change nobody believes in - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/02/shutterstock_180419411.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-02-25T08:44:57+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/202146/license-plate-readers-net-neutrality/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "Watchdog Arena", "published_time": "2015-02-24T15:31:31+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-25T08:44:57+00:00"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Through net neutrality, the same government that spies on you online is also going to regulate internet service providers.", "title": "License plate readers, net neutrality, and change nobody believes in - Watchdog.org", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/02/shutterstock_180419411.jpg"}, "creator": "@watchdogorg", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "description": "Through net neutrality, the same government that spies on you online is also going to regulate internet service providers."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbe8d\"", "article_summary": "This paragraph from the ACLU is typical:Automatic license plate readers must not be used to collect information on lawful activity \u2014 whether it be peacefully assembling for lawful purposes, or driving on the nation\u2019s highways.\nYet again President Obama is looking at using regulations and executive actions to achieve his goals, instead of working with Congress.\nThis article was written by a contributor of Watchdog Arena, Franklin Center\u2019s network of writers, bloggers, and citizen journalists.\nWithout strong regulations and greater transparency, this new technology will only increase the threat of illegitimate government surveillance.\nCharles Grassley (R., Iowa) and Patrick Leahy (D., Vt.), said the DEA\u2019s database raises privacy concerns."}
