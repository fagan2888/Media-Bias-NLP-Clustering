WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court refused Tuesday to consider yet another challenge to Obamacare.

The justices turned down a challenge from conservatives that contended Congress violated the Constitution when it approved the law in 2010 by sending a bill that raised revenue through the Senate before the House. The Constitution says revenue-raising bills must originate in the House.

A federal appeals court had turned down the petition because, a panel of judges said, the law was predominately a bill to improve health insurance coverage, not a revenue-raising bill. Conservatives on the full appeals court contested that ruling — but they said the legislation actually did originate in the House, so they would have denied the challenge on other grounds.

By refusing to hear the case, a majority of Supreme Court justices either agreed with one or both of those reasons — or they simply have had enough of President Obama's signature health insurance law.

Twice before, the court has upheld the Affordable Care Act against major challenges raised by conservatives opposed to the law. The justices also have struck down a provision that forced for-profit corporations with religious objections to pay for contraceptive coverage, and they will hear a similar case this spring that could give religious non-profits the same exemption.

The latest challenge, therefore, would have been the fifth Obamacare case to reach the high court.
