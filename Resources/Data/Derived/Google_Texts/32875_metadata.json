Lynn Jenkins of Kansas.\n\nThe bill\u2019s passage could put pressure on Senate Democrats to take up the measure \u2014 several are in tough re-election bids and the mandate is an unpopular facet of Mr. Obama\u2019s law \u2014 but Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, Nevada Democrat, has let other anti-Obamacare bills die on the legislative vine.\n\nSens. Mark Kirk, Illinois Republican, and Joe Manchin, West Virginia Democrat, introduced a bill in November that would delay the individual mandate until January 2015, but it has gone nowhere.\n\nIn the House, 27 Democrats voted to delay the mandate.\n\nHouse Democrats who voted against the measure said the GOP was wasting its time by trying to gut the health-care law once again.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t we have anything else to do?\u201d said Rep. Henry Waxman, a California Democrat who is retiring.\n\nThe individual mandate is a key lever in the administration\u2019s hopes to have Obamacare\u2019s economics work. By requiring almost all Americans to get covered if they can afford it, healthy enrollees will keep premiums in check when people with pre-existing medical conditions enter the market because insurers can no longer reject them.\n\nUnder the law, a single adult who flouts the mandate in 2014 must pay $95 or 1 percent of his income above the filing threshold, whichever is higher. The baseline penalty climbs in 2015 to $325 or 2 percent of adjusted income. In 2016, it will be $695 or 2.5 percent.\n\nAlthough pundits say the $95 baseline is relatively weak, high-earners who violate the mandate will pay substantially more, tax analysts warn.\n\nThe penalty is among a series of taxes and fees designed to pay for the reforms, including government-subsidized plans on the health care exchanges and the state-by-state expansion of Medicaid.\n\nRepublicans have said the administration is being hypocritical by repeatedly ordering changes and delays to the law in an election year, only to thwart GOP-sponsored attempts to amend the law legislatively.\n\nFor example on Wednesday, the administration is expected to extend by two years a policy it announced last fall to let people keep health plans that do not comply with Obamacare. The extension, according to the Associated Press, would be valid for policies issued up to Oct. 1, 2016.\n\n\u201cIf the bill\u2019s supporters are so worried about voters seeing what the law is about in its implementation, what about the families that aren\u2019t getting the favored treatment? That\u2019s what we\u2019re about,\u201d said House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, Virginia Republican.\n\nThe White House said this week it \u201cstrongly opposes\u201d the House bill and that Mr. Obama would veto it.\n\nThe administration says the health-care law has recovered from its early stumbles, and that more than 4 million people have signed up for private coverage on state-based health exchanges ahead of the March 31 deadline.\n\nDelaying the mandate would \u201cincrease the number of uninsured, and shift costs to businesses, workers, and health care providers,\u201d the White House said Tuesday in a statement of administrative policy on the bill.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Nearly 30 House Democrats ignored a veto threat by President Obama's and helped the GOP majority pass a bill Wednesday that would let people ignore this year's Obamacare penalty for not having health insurance.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Nearly 30 House Democrats ignored a veto threat by President Obama\u2019s and helped the GOP majority pass a bill Wednesday that would let people ignore this year\u2019s Obamacare penalty for not having health insurance.", "title": "House votes to delay Obamacare individual mandate", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/mar/5/house-votes-delay-obamacare-individual-mandate/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/10/20/10202013_ap3143293273248201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/10/20/10202013_ap3143293273248201.jpg", "description": "Nearly 30 House Democrats ignored a veto threat by President Obama's and helped the GOP majority pass a bill Wednesday that would let people ignore this year's Obamacare penalty for not having health", "card": "summary", "title": "House votes to delay Obamacare individual mandate"}, "Author": "Tom Howell Jr.", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Social Issues, Politics, Republican Party"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbc30\"", "article_summary": "The White House said this week it \u201cstrongly opposes\u201d the House bill and that Mr. Obama would veto it.\nThe individual mandate is a key lever in the administration\u2019s hopes to have Obamacare\u2019s economics work.\nIn the House, 27 Democrats voted to delay the mandate.\nMark Kirk, Illinois Republican, and Joe Manchin, West Virginia Democrat, introduced a bill in November that would delay the individual mandate until January 2015, but it has gone nowhere.\nHouse Democrats who voted against the measure said the GOP was wasting its time by trying to gut the health-care law once again."}
