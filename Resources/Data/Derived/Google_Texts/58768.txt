FOR YOUR VIEWS. ALWAYS A PLEASURE TO HAVE YOU. >> GOOD TO BE WITH YOU. THANKS, DAVID. >> NOW I WANT TO TURN TO THE POLITICS OF WEATHER. WHAT A BIG STORY THIS WEEK. AND THIS MORNING, IN JAKARTA, INDONESIA, JOHN KERRY GAVE THE FIRST IN A SERIES OF SPEECHES ON CLIMATE CHANGE SAYING IT IS THREATENING THE WORLD'S WAY OF LIFE. I'M GOING TO DISCUSS THE DEBATE OVER CLIMATE CHANGE POLICIES IN JUST A MOMENT WITH SCIENCE EDUCATOR BILL NYE AND THE SCIENCE GUY AND REPUBLICAN CONGRESS WOMAN FROM TENNESSEE MARSHA BLACKBURN. BUT FIRST, IS THE GROWING COST OF OUR RECENT WEATHER DISASTERS CREATING A NEW FOCUS ON THE NEED FOR ACTION ON CLIMATE CHANGING? >> THIS WEEK'S STORM LEFT HALF A MILLION GEORGIANS WITHOUT POWER AT ITS PEAK, BURIED CITIES IN SNOW AND ICE, STRANDED FLYERS AND PRACTICALLY SHUTTERED THE CAPITAL. EXTREME COLD HAS FROZEN LAKE SUPERIOR TO LEVELS NOT SEEN IN DECADE AND LED TO ICE CAVES OFF THE WATER. IN CALIFORNIA, DROUGHT GRIPPING 90% OF THE STATE HAS PARCHED CROPS AND DRIED UP FOOD SUPPLIES FOR LIVESTOCK. >> IS IT A NATURAL CYCLE? IS IT DUE TO HUMAN INTERFERENCE OR HUMAN CONDITIONS THAT WE HAVE CREATED? THAT REMAINS OPEN TO DEBATE. BUT THERE IS NO DOUBT THE CLIMATE IS CHANGING. >> PRESIDENT OBAMA TOURED A FRESNO FARM FRIDAY TO IT OUT FEDERAL SUPPORT TO ADDRESS CALIFORNIA'S WATER CRISIS. IN HIS STATE OF THE UNION SPEECH, HE WAS ADAMANT. >> THE DEBATE IS SETTLED. CLIMATE CHANGE IS A FACT. >> THE EXTREME WEATHER IS NOT LIMITED TO THE UNITED STATES. MASSIVE FLOODING HAS LEFT LARGE PARTS OF ENGLAND UNDERWATER OVER THE PAST TWO THE MONTHS. THE CHIEF SCIENTIST OF UK'S NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE SAID ALL THE EVIDENCE SUGGESTS CLIMATE CHANGING IS TO BLAME. SKEPTICS SAY THE FORECASTS OF DOOM AND GLOOM ARE OVERBLOWN. >> AFTER YOU ADJUST FOR THE FACT THAT THERE ARE SO MANY MORE PEOPLE LIVING IN SO MANY MORE PLACES, THERE'S NO CHANGING IN WEATHER-RELATED DAMAGES. >> BILL NYE AND MARSHA BLACKBURN, WELCOME TO "MEET THE PRESS." >> GOOD TO BE WITH YOU. THANKS, DAVID. >> THANK YOU. >> SO HERE WAS "THE GUARDIAN" NEWPAPER AFTER ALL THE FLOODING IN THE UK AND HERE'S THE HEADLINE, CLIMATE CHANGE IS HERE NOW, IT COULD LEAD TO GLOBAL CONFLICT IF THE POLITICIANS SQUABBLE. IN THE PSYCH COMMUNITY, THIS IS NOT A DEBATE WHETHER CLIMATE CHANGE IS REAL. THE CONSENSUS IS THAT IT IS. THE MAJORITY OF THOSE WHO BELIEVE THAT IT IS CAUSED BY HUMANS. THERE ARE CERTAINLY SOME IN THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY WHO DON'T BELIEVE THAT'S THE CASE. AND WHO ARE SKEPTICAL ABOUT SOME OF THOSE CONCLUSIONS. BUT NEVERTHELESS, THERE IS STILL THIS LEVEL OF CONSENSUS. MY QUESTION TO BEGIN WITH BOTH OF YOU IS IN THIS MOMENT OF THIS KIND OF EXTREME WEATHER MOMENT, IS IT CREATING NEW URGENCY TO ACT? BILL NYE, I'LL START WITH YOU. >> WELL, I WOULD SAY YEAH, AND WHAT I'VE ALWAYS SAID WE NEED TO DO EVERYTHING ALL AT ONCE. THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE UNITED STATES TO INNOVATE, TO BE THE WORLD LEADER IN NEW TECHNOLOGIES THAT IF YOU COULD INVENT A BETTER BATTERY, A BETTER WAY TO STORE ELECTRICITY, YOU WOULD CHANGE THE WORLD AND IF YOU WERE TO DO THAT IN A WAY THAT YOU COULD MANUFACTURE AND EXPORT IT, YOU WOULD ALSO DO VERY WELL FINANCIALLY. >> CONGRESS WOMAN, IS THERE NEW HAD URGENCY TO ACT? YOU'VE HEARD THE PRESIDENT ANY DROUGHT STRICKEN CALIFORNIA SAYING THESE WEATHER EMERGENCIES IN EFFECT ARE CREATING THE CONDITIONS THE GOVERNMENT HAS TO ACT. >> DAVID, I THINK THAT WHAT IT BRINGS TO MIND IS HOW WE UTILIZE THE INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE. AND WE ALL KNOW -- AND I THINK THAT BILL WOULD PROBABLY AGREE WITH THIS. NEITHER HE NOR I ARE A CLIMATE SCIENCE. HE IS AN ACTOR AND I'M A MEMBER OF MEMBER OF CONGRESS. AS YOU SAID, THERE IS NOT AGREEMENT AROUND THE FACT OF EXACTLY WHAT IS CAUSING THIS, EVEN THE PRESIDENT'S OWN SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY OFFICE HAD MR. HOLDREN SAYS NO ONE SINGLE WEATHER EVENT IS DUE SPECIFICALLY TO CLIMATE CHANGE. SO IT DRIVES THE POLICY TO LOOK AT COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS, WHAT WE DO ABOUT IT AND THE IMPACT THAT U.S. POLICY WOULD HAVE IN A GLOBAL ENVIRONMENT. >> WELL, AND THAT'S ANOTHER QUESTION THAT I WANT TO GET TO. BUT THERE IS CONSENSUS, AS YOU SAY, CON GRES WOMAN, THERE IS SOME SKEPTICISM ABOUT THE DEGREEING TO WHICH HUMANS MAY CAUSE CLIMATE CHANGE OR CAN YOU SPECIFICALLY SAY A WEATHER EVENT CAN BE BLAMED ON CLIENT CHANGE? SOME DISAGREEMENT WITH THAT WITHIN THE UK. WITHIN THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY, THERE IS CONSENSUS, BILL NYE, AMONG THE SCIENTISTS THEMSELVES ON BOTH OF THOSE QUESTIONS. >> WELL, I'VE GOT TO SAY ONCE AGAIN, WHAT PEOPLE ARE DOING IS INTRODUCING THE IDEA THAT SCIENTIFIC UNCERTAINTY IN THIS CASE ABOUT COLD WEATHER EVENTS AND WHAT WE CALL BACK EAST ARE -- IS THE SAME AS UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE WHOLE IDEA OF CLIMATE CHANGE. AND THIS IS UNSCIENTIFIC. IT'S NOT LOGICAL. IT IS A WAY APPARENTLY THAT THE FOSSIL FUEL INDUSTRY HAS DEALT WITH OUR POLITICS. AND THIS IS NOT GOOD. EVERYBODY -- THIS IS NOT -- YOU DON'T NEED A P.h.D. IN CLIMATE SCIENCE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON, THAT THING THAT WE HAVE OVERWHELMING EVIDENCE THAT CLIMATE IS CHANGING. THAT YOU CANNOT TIE ANY ONE EVENT TO THAT IS NOT THE SAME AS DOUBT ABOUT THE WHOLE THING. >> BUT IS THE ISSUE, CONGRESS WOMAN, THE CURE OR THE DISEASE AND WHAT'S WORSE? HERE'S THE ATLANTIC MAGAZINE ON SOME OF THE VIEWS WITHIN YOUR PARTY WITHIN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY ON GLOBAL WARMING CONSERVATIVE POLICY POSITIONS OFTEN SEEM TO BE CON DUPLICATED OR CONFUSED WITH REJECTION OF THE CONSENSUS THAT THE PLANT HAS BEEN WARMING DUE TO HUMAN.KAURPEN EMISSIONS. THE VAST MAJORITY DO NOT REJECT THE SCIENCE OF GLOBAL WARMING. THE CATCH, CONSERVATIVES BELIEVE MANY OF THE POLICIES PUT FORWARD TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM WILL LEAD TO UNACCEPTABLE LEVELS OF ECONOMIC HARDSHIP. THE FIX CAN BE VERY EXBENSIVE IN THE SHORT TERM FOR LONG-TERM GAIN. >> WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO IS LOOK AT WHAT THAT WARMING IS. AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE FACT THAT WE HAVE GONE FROM FROM 320 PARTS PER MILLION, 0.032 TO.040, 400 PARTS PER MILLION, WHAT YOU DO IS REALIZE IT'S VERY SLIGHT. NOW, THERE IS NOT CONSENSUS, AND YOU CAN LOOK AT THE LATEST IPCC REPORT AND LOOK AT DR. LINZEN EVERYONE M.I.T. HIS REJECTION OF THAT OR JUDITH CURRY WHO RECENTLY FROM GEORGIA TECH. THERE IS NOT CONSENSUS THERE. I THINK WHAT WE HAVE TO DO -- >> HOLD ON, I HAVE TO INTERRUPT YOU. LET ME INTERRUPT YOU BECAUSE IT'S NOT -- YOU CAN PICK OUT PARTICULAR SKEPTICS BUT YOU CAN'T REALLY SAY, CAN YOU, THAT THE HUNDREDS OF SCENE TIFF ACTIVITIES AROUND THE WORLD HAVE GOTTEN TOGETHER AND CONSPIRED TO MANIPULATE DATA AND THAT INDUSTRY FOLKS, LIKE PG & E, A NATURAL GAS PRODUCER SAYING AS A PROVIDER OF GAS AND ELECTRICITY TO MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS AND EMITTER OF GREENHOUSE GASES, IT IS KEENLY AWARE OF ITS RESPONSIBILITY TO BOTH MANAGE EMISSIONS AND WORK TO ADVANCE POLICIES THAT MUT OUR STATE AND THE COUNTRY ON A COST EFFECTIVE PATH TOWARD A LOW CARBON ECONOMY. SO THE ISSUE IS WHAT ACTIONS ARE TAKEN AND WILL THEY REALLY WORK. FIRST TO YOU, CONGRESS WOMAN AND LET ME HAVE BILL NYE RESPOND. >> YOU'RE RIGHT. LET'S SAY EVERYTHING THAT BILL SAYS IS WRONG IS WRONG. LET'S JUST SAY THAT. THEN YOU SAY WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT IT? WHAT WOULD THE POLICY BE AND WILL THAT POLICY HAVE AN IMPACT. NOW, EVEN DIRECTOR McCARTHY FROM THE EPA IN ANSWERING QUESTIONS FROM CONGRESSMAN POMPEO BEFORE OUR COMMITTEE SAID REACHING ALL OF THE 26 U.S. GOALS IS NOT GOING TO HAVE AN IMPACT GLOBALLY. AND DAVID, WHAT WE HAVE TO LOOK AT IS THE FACT THAT YOU DON'T MAKE GOOD LAWS SUSTAINABLE LAWS WHEN YOU'RE MAKING THEM ON THEORIES OR UNPROVEN SCIENCES. >> BILL NYE? >> WELL, ONCE AGAIN, THE CONGRESS WOMAN IS TRYING TO INTRODUCE DOUBT, AND DOUBT IN THE WHOLE IDEA OF CLIMATE CHANGE. SO WHAT I WOULD ENCOURAGE EVERYBODY TO DO IS BACK UP AND LET'S AGREE ON THE FACTS. WOULD YOU SAY THAT THE ANTARCTIC HAS LESS ICE THAN IT USED TO? WHEN YOU ASSERTED, CONGRESS WOMAN THAT A CHANGE FROM 320 TO 400 PARTS PER MILLION IS INSIGNIFICANT? MY GOODNESS, THAT'S 30%. I MEAN, THAT'S AN ENORMOUS CHANGE AND IT'S CHANGING THE WORLD. THAT'S JUST OVER THE LAST FEW DECADES. YOU GO BACK TO 1750 WITH THE INVENTION OF THE STEAM ENGINE, IT EVERYBODY'S BEEN OVER THIS A LOT, IT'S GONE FROM 250 TO 400. THERE IS NO DEBATE IN THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY. AND I CAN ENCOURAGE THE CONGRESS WOMAN TO LOOK AT THE FACTS. YOU ARE A LEADER. WE NEED YOU TO CHANGE THINGS, NOT DENY WHAT'S HAPPENING >> LET ME INJECT THIS POINT. I WANT TO INJECT THIS POINT. >> WHETHER IS IMPORTANT. >> I WANT TO STICK TO THE POINT ABOUT WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IN THE FUTURE WITH POLICY. >> YEAH. >> THE REALITY IS, THAT SOMETHING IS HAPPENING. AND IN WHETHER YOU'RE ALONG THE EAST COAST, IF YOU LOOK AT ALL THE MONEY THAT WAS SPENT ON INFRASTRUCTURE AFTER HURRICANE SANDY OR YOU LOOK AT FLOODING, HAVE YOU STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS, CON GRES WOMAN, WHO HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE REALITIES OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND IT'S EXPENSIVE. YOU'RE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE FUTURE OF OUR DEBT. THERE'S A LOT OF COST INVOLVED HERE. HOW DOES GOVERNMENT RESPONSIBLY EVEN WHERE THERE MIGHT BE DIFFERENCES ON THE POLICY AND CURE, RESPOND TO THE VERY REALTIME IMPACTS OF WEATHER AND A CHANGING CLIMATE? >> THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT. IT IS EXPENSIVE WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE CLEAN-UP. DAVID, ONE OF THE THINGS WE HAVE TO REMEMBER IS COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS HAS TO TAKE PLACE. AND THAT IS SOMETHING -- THAT GOES BACK TO A CLINTON EXECUTIVE ORDER. AND IT IS REQUIRED. AND IT IS UNFORTUNATE THAT SOME OF THE FEDERAL AGENCIES ARE NOT CONDUCTING THAT COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS. THEY'RE FOCUSED ON THE OUTCOME. AND THEY NEED WHETHER IT'S THE EPA, WHETHER IT IS THE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY AGENCIES, THEY NEED TO BE DOING THAT COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS. NOW, YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE SOCIAL COST OF CARBON AND THERE IS A LOT OF AMBIGUITY AROUND THAT, WHAT YOU NEED TO BE DOING ALSO IS LOOKING AT THE BENEFITS OF CARBON. A LOT OF GOOD STUDY OUT THERE ABOUT THAT, AND SCIENTISTS AN BIOLOGIES HAVE DONE THAT STUDY. >> BILL NYE, THIS IS THIS ISSUE OF WHAT DO YOU DO ABOUT SOMETHING THAT TO MANY PEOPLE IS VERY IMPORTANT BUT FOR A LOT OF VOTERS MAY NOT FEEL URGENT. LOOK AT THE PEW RESEARCH POLL, GLOBAL WARMING RANKING 19th ON THAT LIST. YET, ENVIRONMENTALISTS SEEN BUOYED BY THE FACT THAT THE PRESIDENT SAY WITH EXECUTIVE ORDERS TORE CURB CARBON EMISSIONS FROM POWER PLANTS, WILL WE'LL TAKE CARE OF VIA EXECUTIVE ACTION TWO-THIRDS OF THE CARBON THAT'S EMITTED INTO THE ATMOSPHERE IN THE UNITED STATES. IS THAT AN ACCEPTABLE SOLUTION WITHOUT POLITICAL CONSENSUS? >> WELL, THAT'S UP TO POLITICIANS. CERTAINLY THE LONGEST JOURNEY STARTS WITH BUT WHICH A SINGLE STEP. WE ALL HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE HAVE A PROBLEM. I THINK IT WOULD BE IN EVERYBODY'S BEST INTERESTS. I WAS BORN IN THE U.S. I'M A PATRIOT. IT WOULD BE IN EVERYBODY'S BEST INTEREST TO GET GOING TO DO AS I LIKE TO SAY EVERYTHING ALL AT ONCE. SO THE FEWER VERY DIRTY COAL FIRED POWER PLANTS WE HAVE, THE BETTER. THE LESS ENERGY WE WASTE THE BETTER. THE LESS INEFFICIENT OUR TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS ARE, THE BETTER. THE MORE RELIABLE OUR ELECTRICITY TRANSMISSION SYSTEMS ARE THE BETTER. AND SO WE ALL GET INTO THIS THING THAT BIG GOVERNMENTS ARE BAD. I KNOW THAT'S A VERY STRONG CLAIM THAT FOR ME, AS A VOTER AND TAXPAYER IS SOMEHOW TIED TO CLIMATE CHANGE. BUT WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS NOT JUST LESS. WE WANT TO DO MORE WITH LESS AND FOR ME, AS A GUY WHO GREW UP IN THE U.S., I WANT THE U.S. TO LEAD THE WORLD IN THIS RATHER THAN WAIT WHILE YOU MADE REFERENCE TO THE UNITED KINGDOM, WHAT CHINA IS DOING WITH ENERGY PRODUCTION, SOLAR ENERGY PRODUCTION, THIS IS A HUGE -- THE MORE WE MESS AROUND WITH THIS DENIAL, THE LESS WE'RE GOING TO GET DONE. >> I WANT TO BE SPECIFIC THOUGH, CONGRESS WOMAN. AS YOU KNOW AS I JUST OUTLINED, THE PRESIDENT IS PROPOSING REGULATIONS. THIS IS EXECUTIVE ACTION. HOW DO YOU RESPOND TO THAT AS A MEMBER OF CONGRESS WHO DOESN'T AGREE WITH THE POLICY? >> I THINK THE PRESIDENT SHOULD REALIZE CONGRESS HAS TAKEN ACTION WHETHER IT WAS CAP AND TRADE OR ANY OF THESE REGULATIONS WE HAVE SAID NO TO THAT. AND ONE OF THE REASONS IS THE COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS AND ANOTHER IS THE IMPACT. LOOK WHAT IS HAPPENING AROUND THE WORLD. BILL DOESN'T LIKE COAL FIRED ELECTRICITY PLANTS. YOU'VE GOT 1200 COMING UP IN OTHER NATIONS RIGHT NOW. AND WHAT WE NEED TO BE LOOKING AT IS THE WAY TO ACHIEVE EFFICIENCIES. CARBON EMISSIONS ARE AT THE LOWEST THEY'VE BEEN SINCE 1994. THE REASON FOR THAT IS EFFICIENCIES. WE NEED TO LOOK AT THE COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS AND MAKE CERTAIN THESE TOOGSS ARE AFFORDABLE FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. >> WE ARE GOING TO LEAVE IT
