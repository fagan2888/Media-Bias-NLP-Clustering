Madison\u201d emerging as a minor theme of the primary. But between Carson and Huckabee it\u2019s already a hot race to see who can pander the hardest to social cons over the upcoming Supreme Court ruling on gay marriage. Huck ante\u2019d up recently with this comment:\n\nIn Letter from a Birmingham Jail, Martin Luther King, Jr. makes the case there comes a time when people of conscience have a moral obligation to practice civil disobedience against \u201cunjust laws.\u201d Do you agree with that? For example, is there anything a court could try and impose upon you as a president that you morally would refuse to comply with? Dr. King\u2019s letter quoted extensively St. Augustine, who developed the doctrine of just and unjust laws. And the necessity to not abide by unjust laws, which as Augustine and King both concurred, \u201cAre not laws at all.\u201d Court decisions that defy the Constitution, or the laws of nature or nature\u2019s God, do not constitute a legal or moral obligation to comply. In addition, the Constitution doesn\u2019t recognize a court\u2014any court, including the Supreme Court\u2014as having absolute power to make a law. In fact, the false doctrine of \u201cjudicial supremacy\u201d is in itself unconstitutional, and defies the balance and separation of powers clearly outlined in our law. Unless the people\u2019s representatives pass enabling legislation and a president signs and agrees to enforce it, there IS no law.\n\nNot true, and it\u2019s politically silly for him to take that tack knowing that he may eventually face a national electorate that now supports gay marriage on balance. Even worse, the prospect of another governor from Arkansas creating a constitutional crisis by refusing to enforce a constitutional ruling of the Supreme Court has earned him comparisons to Orval Faubus even among righties, including George Will just last night on Fox News. The Federal Marriage Amendment was never going to happen but at least it\u2019s a procedurally orthodox response to SSM being legalized. Huckabee trying to reinvent the wheel about presidential duties following a Fourteenth Amendment ruling is \u2026 not orthodox.\n\nBut Carson\u2019s competing for the same voters and can\u2019t be outdone, so here you go.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, we have to understand how the Constitution works. The president is required to carry out the laws of the land, the laws of the land come from the legislative branch,\u201d Carson said on Tuesday. \u201cSo if the legislative branch creates a law or changes a law, the executive branch has a responsibly to carry it out. It doesn\u2019t say they have the responsibility to carry out a judicial law. And that\u2019s something we need to talk about.\u201c\n\nThat\u2019s why I said \u201chints\u201d in the headline instead of \u201cvows\u201d \u2014 even an amateur pol like Carson won\u2019t explicitly commit to refusing to enforce a Supreme Court decision, although that\u2019s clearly what he\u2019s implying. Makes me wonder how he and Huck would approach Supreme Court rulings on subjects more mundane than whether gay marriage should be legal coast to coast. If Court rulings are really just advisory opinions about how the president should behave, then we were all way, waaaaay too invested in that ObamaCare mandate decision a few years ago. Obama already feels free to ignore Congress when it suits him. Let\u2019s encourage him to ignore SCOTUS rulings that he doesn\u2019t like either, I guess.\n\nNot surprisingly, the other formidable social con in the race has a much stronger legal background than Huckabee or Carson and is tailoring his solutions to gay marriage accordingly, with a procedurally sound (albeit still doomed to fail) attempt to amend the Constitution.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t say they have the responsibility to carry out a judicial law.\u201d", "title": "Ben Carson hints: As president, I wouldn\u2019t enforce a Supreme Court decision legalizing gay marriage", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2015/05/06/ben-carson-hints-as-president-i-wouldnt-enforce-a-supreme-court-decision-legalizing-gay-marriage/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@allahpundit"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-06T23:21:58+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-06T19:46:33+00:00"}, "keywords": "Ben Carson, decision, enforce, gay marriage, George Will, legal, legislature, same sex, Supreme Court,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc025\"", "article_summary": "Makes me wonder how he and Huck would approach Supreme Court rulings on subjects more mundane than whether gay marriage should be legal coast to coast.\nBut between Carson and Huckabee it\u2019s already a hot race to see who can pander the hardest to social cons over the upcoming Supreme Court ruling on gay marriage.\nDr. King\u2019s letter quoted extensively St. Augustine, who developed the doctrine of just and unjust laws.\nNot true, and it\u2019s politically silly for him to take that tack knowing that he may eventually face a national electorate that now supports gay marriage on balance.\nIn addition, the Constitution doesn\u2019t recognize a court\u2014any court, including the Supreme Court\u2014as having absolute power to make a law."}
