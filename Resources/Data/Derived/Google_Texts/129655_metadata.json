Sep. 3, 2015. (Photo: Jessica Ebelhar, Special to the C-J)Buy Photo\n\nEvery day for the past 10-plus years, Tommy Jackson has walked the two blocks from his home in the Highlands to his neighborhood bar around 5:30 p.m., when it\u2019s time for dinner and a chat with the owner \u2014 longtime friend Marcia Cain.\n\nFor Jackson, who uses a respirator, can\u2019t cook and doesn\u2019t live near family, Cahoots is like a second home.\n\nBut for others in the neighborhood, the bar is a problem place known for its rumored drug dealings, assaults and other crime. Some residents \u2014 following a mid-August street fight that they say was likely started by Cahoots patrons \u2014 are asking that the bar\u2019s liquor license be revoked.\n\nOn Sept. 15, Cahoots is scheduled to go before the local Alcoholic Beverage Control board to address an Aug. 2 citation \u2014 concerning two bartenders who were found with narcotics and drug paraphernalia \u2014 that could result in a fine or the suspension or loss of its liquor license.\n\nBut despite the bar\u2019s problems, including recent negative publicity and social media scrutiny, Jackson said Cahoots isn\u2019t the bar everyone\u2019s making it out to be.\n\n\u201cI know Marcia, I like her and I can\u2019t imagine that she would do as bad a business as people are trying to say she\u2019s been doing,\u201d said Jackson, who has visited Cahoots for Thanksgiving and Christmas dinners in recent years and said he is never expected to pay. \u201c\u2026 They\u2019re just like family, really, as long as I\u2019ve been coming here. I just hope everything goes good for Marcia.\u201d\n\nIn recent years, Bardstown Road where Cahoots is located has changed.\n\nResidents, business owners and police all acknowledge that \u2014 with more bars opening and others with bad reputations closing \u2014 more people have started visiting the area and more problems have started to arise, with police routinely called on reports of assaults, thefts and drug use.\n\nPolice say the issues are mostly limited to the section between the 900 block of Baxter Avenue and the 1100 block of Bardstown Road, where at least seven bars are located. But members of the Original Highlands Neighborhood Association say they can pinpoint it even further \u2014 the problems, they say, are coming from Cahoots.\n\n\u201cIt seems like all the other bars are doing OK, but Cahoots, it seems like they\u2019re not able to keep the patrons under control,\u201d said association president Matt Blair.\n\nRumors about violence and drug use at the bar aren\u2019t new, but concerns about Cahoots have increased within the past year after a September 2014 police raid found two people with marijuana and cocaine. As seen in a well-viewed YouTube video, police shut down the bar during the raid with more than a dozen people inside, patting them down before they were allowed to leave.\n\nAccording to city documents, ABC officers visited the bar with Louisville Metro Police Department detectives after receiving a complaint that drugs were being sold and used within the building. Officers set up a controlled buy for the inspection, which resulted in one arrest on felony drug trafficking charges and one citation for misdemeanor marijuana possession. Officers also reported finding a 19-year-old minor in the bar.\n\nAt a hearing in January, the ABC board offered Cahoots the option of paying a $2,300 fine instead of having its license suspended. Cain said she paid the fine.\n\nCain and her attorney, Jaret Hill, have since criticized the raid, saying police targeted the business and only found drugs there because they had set up the purchase.\n\n\u201cThe neighborhood people are probably going to be like \u2018yeah, right, whatever,\u2019 but all I really want to do is provide a place for people to come and have a good time and enjoy themselves,\u201d Cain said. \u201cI don\u2019t do drugs; I don\u2019t know about drugs in here.\u201d\n\nSince the raid, though, police calls to the bar have not stopped. In the past year, police have reported 21 incidents at Cahoots, including six drug searches, six assaults, five thefts, two robberies and two fraudulent uses of credit cards.\n\nAt the Highlands Taproom across the street, eight thefts and one charge of criminal mischief have been reported in the same time period.\n\nMost of the thefts and assaults at or outside of Cahoots are minor, but others include horrific reports of a 40-year-old being shot and a 23-year-old being attacked with beer bottles by multiple women. Both of the more violent incidents took place after the June closing of Phoenix Hill Tavern on Baxter Avenue, which some Cahoots customers and Highlands residents say could have caused an increase in criminal activity down the road. The latter attack also took place the same night as the August street fight \u2014 a video of which has been circulated online.\n\nResidents say the video, a version of which has been titled \"cahoots fun,\" is one more example that confirms their stance against the bar, but Cain and the video\u2019s owner, Mula Mezi, say the footage clearly shows the fight taking place down the street, near Friend\u2019s Hookah Caf\u00e9.\n\nMezi originally uploaded the video on his Facebook page and titled it \u201cHuge Fight on BardsTownRd in Louisville, Kentucky !!!\u201d He said he isn\u2019t sure who changed the video\u2019s name and uploaded it to YouTube.\n\n\u201cWhoever renamed it \u2018cahoots fun\u2019 is someone who has a vendetta against Cahoots,\u201d he said.\n\nBlair, with the neighborhood association, said it doesn\u2019t matter where the fight took place. While many of the police-reported incidents have taken place outside the bar, it\u2019s still easy to connect them to Cahoots.\n\n\u201cWhy are all of the problems happening outside happening within spitting distance of the bar?\u201d he asked.\n\nIn recent months, Cain said she has made changes in response to the increased number of customers and police reports, including hiring three off-duty security guards for Friday and Saturday nights, allowing an additional police presence and instituting a weekend cover charge. She\u2019s also eliminated live entertainment on Saturdays and raised drink prices throughout the week.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want bad things happening in the area,\u201d Cain said. \u201cI live here, I work here and I have for many years. It\u2019s very concerning, yes. I\u2019m just as much a victim as anyone else.\u201d\n\nBut Blair and the association say the changes aren\u2019t enough. The association has now requested the ABC board revoke Cahoots\u2019 liquor license and not allow any future business in that building to receive a license allowing sales past 2 a.m.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a line between a bar-restaurant and a nightclub,\u201d said Highlands resident Winn Willinger. \u201cIf you\u2019re open at 4 a.m., you\u2019re selling cheap beer and having some sort of event, trying to get as many in the door for cover as you can. \u2026 The crowd coming in and causing trouble are coming in for clubbing.\u201d\n\nCustomers at Cahoots say the problems won\u2019t go away if the bar were to close. They\u2019ll just move somewhere else.\n\nAnd the group of regulars that appreciate the bar and the kindness of its owner \u2014 known for planning fundraisers for customers down on their luck, including one man who couldn\u2019t afford his father\u2019s funeral \u2014 will have nowhere to go.\n\n\u201c(Marcia\u2019s) real good to everybody,\u201d said customer Michael O\u2019Bryan. \u201cEverybody gets the benefit of the doubt with her. She just welcomes people into her business. Everybody\u2019s like her friend. She doesn\u2019t have customers as much as she has friends.\u201d\n\nReach reporter Bailey Loosemore at 502-582-4646 or bloosemore@courier-journal.com.\n\n\n\nALCOHOLIC BEVERAGE CONTROL HEARING\n\nWhat: The local ABC board will consider taking action against Cahoots for an Aug. 2 citation concerning two bartenders found with narcotics.\n\nWhen: 1 p.m. Sept. 15\n\nWhere: Old Jail Building, 514 W.
