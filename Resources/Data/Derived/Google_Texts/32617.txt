The bright yellow image with the doctor’s stethoscope coiled into the form of a snake makes one do a double take.

You almost have to ask yourself: Am I really looking at a pro-Obamacare bumper sticker, or a Tea Party flag?

With the new “Don’t Tread on My Obamacare” bumper stickers being rolled out by the political group, Organizing for Action, it is hard to tell.







And the Tea Party, known for flying its 'Don’t Tread on Me’ revolutionary-era Gadsden Flag, could be fighting mad about this critical case of logo encroachment.

First a little background from MedCityNews.com, which picked up on the Organizing for Action email touting the new bumper stickers.



And here is some of what that email said:

“We've been trying to come up with the perfect way to show how proud we are of Obamacare," officials at Organizing for Action wrote in an email blasted out to supporters. "I think we've got a good idea -- this bumper sticker."

You might remember Organizing for Action as the pro-Democrat group born from Obama's 2012 re-election campaign.



And this time it is taking the fight for Obamacare right to the Tea Party-backed opposition. More from that email touting the bumper sticker:

"This is for everyone who's tired of hearing the other side talk smack about the health care reform ..."

So if you "wanna brag about it," as the email notes, you simply have to hit up Organizing for Action's Facebook page, and they'll give you a bumper sticker for free.

No word on whether if you like your old bumper sticker, you can keep it, too.

So what do you think of this eerily similar Obamacare bumper sticker?
