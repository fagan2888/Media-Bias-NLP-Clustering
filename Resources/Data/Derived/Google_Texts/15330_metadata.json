Engines were taken out of use, and staffing on the streets was reduced from 86 to 79 employees per shift. The district reshuffled assignments and station duties to squeeze every bit of savings it could without resorting to layoffs, Lombardi said.\n\n\u201cFrom a life-safety standpoint, we have still been able to meet the needs of the community,\u201d he added. \u201cThere\u2019s a number of things around service where maybe the public wouldn\u2019t notice\u2026but the firefighters on the ground do. It\u2019s a big deal from a management perspective.\u201d\n\nAccording to the 2016 district budget, forecasting for future years sees revenue leveling off or trending slightly upward.\n\nWest Metro officials said the sunnier revenue predictions, coupled with a two-year, $3.6 million Federal Emergency Management Agency grant to train and hire 24 firefighters, will help the district, but there\u2019s still a lot of ground to make up.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t hired in three years,\u201d Lombardi said. \u201cThis will be our biggest recruit class in history.\u201d\n\nWest Metro board of directors president Pam Feely said one of the top priorities is replenishing the district\u2019s reserve fund \u2014 over $5 million has been taken out since 2009 \u2014 along with a slate of capital improvement projects that had to be shelved during the downturn.\n\n\u201cWe want to make sure whatever we do is sustainable for as long as possible without having to go back to the voter,\u201d Feely said.\n\nAmira Watters, the executive director of the Jeffco Business Resource Center, is on a joint citizen/firefighter strategic planning committee tasked with looking for ways the district can enhance services.\n\nShe said after a year of interviews and assessments, one of the top recommendations the committee will make in its final report is improvements West Metro can make around communicating with the public.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re really a well-respected organization in Jefferson County, and yet, people aren\u2019t aware of many of the educational programs they have and services they offer,\u201d Watters said. \u201cWe saw there\u2019s room for improvement in how they get the word out to the public.\u201d\n\nThe district provides service to almost 250,000 people in Lakewood and Morrison, parts of Golden and Wheat Ridge, parts of unincorporated Jefferson County, and Roxborough and Waterton Canyon in Douglas County.\n\nThis year, plans call for a merger with the Wheat Ridge Fire Protection District, which will allow for more streamlined operations, Feely said.\n\nShe added: \u201cIt\u2019ll also allow for better opportunities for people on both sides to advance up,\u201d she added.\n\nAustin Briggs: 303-954-1729, abriggs@denverpost.com or @abriggs", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "West Metro Fire stabilizing after years of cuts, financial woes", "title": "West Metro Fire stabilizing after years of cuts, financial woes", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/03/28/west-metro-fire-stabilizing-after-years-of-cuts-financial-woes/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160328__West_metrop1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160328__West_metrop1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-03-28T17:18:51+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-15T06:22:32+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8a5d\"", "article_summary": "West Metro collected roughly $35 million a year in property taxes the last three years; for 2016, that number is expected to jump to $40 million.\nLAKEWOOD \u2014 The West Metro Fire Protection District is clawing its way back to financial stability after seven years of budget cuts, staff reductions and service loss wrought by the Great Recession.\nShe said after a year of interviews and assessments, one of the top recommendations the committee will make in its final report is improvements West Metro can make around communicating with the public.\nLombardi said the district was hit hard after voters shot down a proposed 2014 mill levy increase.\nThis year, plans call for a merger with the Wheat Ridge Fire Protection District, which will allow for more streamlined operations, Feely said."}
