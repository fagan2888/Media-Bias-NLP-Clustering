A bone that Democrats may throw to Republicans as the fight continues over Obamacare is the prospect of repealing one portion of President Obama’s health-care overhaul: a 2.3% excise tax on medical device makers. But investors don’t seem to think the idea was getting any traction if Thursday’s stock action is any indication.

While shares of virtually all the major device makers were up, none posted remarkable gains that outpaced the broader rally. The likes of Medtronic Inc. /quotes/zigman/233680 /quotes/nls/mdt MDT , St. Jude Medical Inc. /quotes/zigman/242119 /quotes/nls/stj STJ and Waters Corp. /quotes/zigman/131375 /quotes/nls/wat WAT had limited gains of less than 1%. Boston Scientific Corp. /quotes/zigman/220154 /quotes/nls/bsx BSX neared 2% in gains but because of its discounted stock price, that amounted to roughly 20 cents a share.

Still, the prospect of repealing the excise tax has wide support on both sides of the aisle, including some notable liberal lawmakers whose companies happen to be in their states.

Minnesota Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Al Franken, both staunch Democrats, have called for the repeal — as the headquarters of both Medtronic and St. Jude are in their backyard in the Twin Cities. And Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren has sided with them, no doubt defending the interests of Boston Scientific and nearby rivals Waters and Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. /quotes/zigman/243451 /quotes/nls/tmo TMO Klobuchar, however, is against tying a repeal of the tax to the budget bill; she prefers that it be connected to a later debate on the debt limit.

Investors may be reacting to that as well as promises from Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, the Democrat from Nevada, who has vowed to deliver a budget bill back to the House that strips out all language regarding the defunding of Obamacare. Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona has said he sees little chance of such an amendment to the budget bill getting past Reid.

Ultimately, however, repeal of the excise tax may be a tough sell for the president as well, since it is one of several critical funding sources that pay for government subsidies of insurance. The theory was that medical device makers would benefit from a larger number of those on insurance rolls.
