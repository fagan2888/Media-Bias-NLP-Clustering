It just happened to be resting in the flood path of the dam\u2019s reservoir that would become Lake Diefenbacker in Saskatchewan, Canada. Efforts to save the rock were made, but not successful.\n\nThis month, in 70 feet of cold, dark water, divers discovered pieces of the sacred rock in Lake Diefenbacker, reports The StarPhoenix.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s it. There\u2019s no question. The rocks are sharp and jagged, they\u2019re not rounded,\u201d Steven Thair, an avid diver who went searching for the missing pieces, told The StarPhoenix. \u201cThere\u2019s no piles of rock like this anywhere on the prairie. I\u2019m talking eight feet high and 30 feet across.\u201d\n\nHe started researching more than a year ago how to locate Mistaseni. According to The StarPhoenix, he searched government files, archives, and museum documents. He found the rock in an aerial image from 1958, but still had no coordinates, so an engineer friend used GIS software to help with that.\n\n\u201cI was in grade 12 when The StarPhoenix, actually, came out and here was this picture of the rock being blown to smithereens,\u201d Thair said.\n\nIt was an emotional day for Tyrone Tootoosis, of the Poundmaker Cree Nation, who was with the dive team when they found Mistaseni. His late father, Wilfred Tootoosis, had tried saving the sacred rock in the 1960s, reports The StarPhoenix.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to put into words, to do justice to what I felt on that day, for the simple reason being that I had never, ever thought I\u2019d have a chance to be involved in something like this, and the fact I was one of the first people to again touch the rock, something that had happened for thousands and thousands of years until the 1960s,\u201d he told The StarPhoenix. \u201cIt was highly, highly revered by our people back then, and still is.\u201d\n\nPieces of the sacred rock were used as part of a monument on Chief Poundmaker\u2019s grave, and to form a cairn that serves as a monument to Mistaseni on the shore of Lake Diefenbacker.\n\nThair also brought along a videographer and plans to make a documentary telling the story of Mistaseni.\n\n\u201cI think the telling of the story is important, the sharing of what the rock means to our people\u2014not meant, but means,\u201d Tootoosis told The StarPhoenix. \u201cIt\u2019s pointless to ponder on what could have been done. It was done. It\u2019s too late now. But going forward, what can be done is to ensure this doesn\u2019t happen to any of our other sites.\u201d\n\nBarry Ahenakew, an elder of the Ahtahkakoop Cree Nation, explained to The StarPhoenix that the sacred rock was once a gathering place for seven plains Cree groups.\n\nHe said he is glad the history will be brought to life with a documentary, and that even though the pieces are underwater, the spirit of the Buffalo Child Stone\u2014what he calls the sacred rock\u2014remains.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s bringing awareness to the Buffalo Child Stone and it\u2019s bringing awareness to that location,\u201d Ahenakew told The StarPhoenix. \u201cIt\u2019s something great to be bringing it back to light, that this place is a sacred place.\u201d\n\nThair does want to tell the story of what happened in 1966, but also he wants to be point out that he doesn\u2019t think it would happen now.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think any government would blow the rock up if the circumstances were what they are today, and I don\u2019t think the aboriginal community would stand for it,\u201d he told The StarPhoenix. \u201cWe\u2019re sure not finished, but we\u2019ve made progress.\u201d\n\nRead the story of Buffalo Child Stone, as Ahenakew told it to The StarPhoenix here.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Remnants of a rock sacred to the Cree and Assiniboine nations\u2014Mistaseni\u2014has been discovered in Lake Diefenbacker in Saskatchewan, Canada.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/08/27/remnants-sacred-rock-destroyed-60s-discovered-underwater-156614", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/wilfred-tootoosis-mistaseni.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Remnants of Sacred Rock Destroyed in the 60s Discovered Underwater"}, "abstract": "Remnants of a rock sacred to the Cree and Assiniboine nations\u2014Mistaseni\u2014has been discovered in Lake Diefenbacker in Saskatchewan, Canada.", "dc": {"title": "Remnants of Sacred Rock Destroyed in the 60s Discovered Underwater"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/08/27/remnants-sacred-rock-destroyed-60s-discovered-underwater-156614", "dcterms.creator": "leeanne", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Native American Sacred Sites, Sacred Sites, Canada, Cree Nation, Poundmaker Cree, Native American History, Saskatchewan, Assiniboine", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 3}, "dcterms.date": "2014-08-27T13:25-04:00", "dcterms.title": "Remnants of Sacred Rock Destroyed in the 60s Discovered Underwater"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb8f5\"", "article_summary": "This month, in 70 feet of cold, dark water, divers discovered pieces of the sacred rock in Lake Diefenbacker, reports The StarPhoenix.\nThe sacred rock, Mistaseni or \u201cBig Rock\u201d to the Cree, was blown to pieces with dynamite in 1966 to make way for the South Saskatchewan River Dam Project.\nHis late father, Wilfred Tootoosis, had tried saving the sacred rock in the 1960s, reports The StarPhoenix.\nThe 400-ton rock resembled a resting buffalo and was sacred to the Assiniboine and Cree nations.\nThe rocks are sharp and jagged, they\u2019re not rounded,\u201d Steven Thair, an avid diver who went searching for the missing pieces, told The StarPhoenix."}
