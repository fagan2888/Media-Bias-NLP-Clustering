The multi-billionaire businessman and serial bully in dealing with his critics wrote that he \u201cliked The Kelly File much better without @megynkelly,\u201d and later retweeted a message that called her a \u201cbimbo.\u201d\n\nAiles, who tried at one point to make peace with Trump and avert a threatened Trump boycott of Fox, issued a statement today saying Trump\u2019s \u201csurprise and unprovoked attack\u201d on Kelly is \u201cas unacceptable as it is disturbing.\u201d\n\n\u201cMegyn Kelly represents the very best of American journalism and all of us at Fox News Channel reject the crude and irresponsible attempt to suggest otherwise,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI could not be more proud of Megyn for her professionalism and class in the face of all of Mr. Trump\u2019s verbal assaults.\u201d\n\nTrump fired back with a statement of his own, saying he \u201ctotally disagrees\u201d with Ailes and does not think Kelly is a \u201cquality journalist.\u201d\n\nRelated: Fox News: Republican Trump Should Apologize After Latest Twitter Outburst\n\n\u201cI think her questioning of me, despite all of the polls saying I won the debate, was very unfair. Hopefully in the future I will be proven wrong and she will be able to elevate her standards to a level of professionalism that a network such as FOX deserves,\u201d Trump said.\n\nAiles, a veteran Republican political pro and TV new impresario, may be on to something in saying that Trump\u2019s obsessive attacks on Kelly are highly disturbing \u2013 and even bizarre. The day after the nationally televised debate in Cleveland, Trump said on CNN that the Fox News Channel anchor \u201chad blood coming out of her eyes\u201d when she was questioning him.\n\n\u201cYou could see there was blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her wherever,\u201d he added, a comment many interpreted as a suggestion that Kelly was having her period.\n\nAccording to Politico, Bret Baier, who was one of the three moderators of the GOP debate, tweeted, \"It's been 19 days since the debate - @realDonaldTrump has made his feelings clear. But THIS needs to stop.\" He added the hashtag \"#letitgo.\"\n\nThe big question hanging over this growing feud between the leading GOP presidential candidate and the leading conservative television network is who needs the other more. Fox is still celebrating its ratings from the first debate where Trump emerged as the dominant figure and helped attract 24 million viewers. It could be a long campaign season for the network if Trump boycotts them while regularly turning up on all their competitors\u2019 news programs.\n\nRelated: Trump\u2019s Campaign, Leaking Oil, Rumbles Onward\n\nOn the other hand, there are political risks inherent in Trump -- or any other presidential candidate, for that matter -- crossing Fox and bypassing a huge audience of largely conservative viewers \u2013 especially if the GOP presidential campaign begins to tighten.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Well, it looks as if the truce is over \u2013 and we\u2019re not talking about last weekend\u2019s d\u00e9", "title": "Ailes Blasts Trump for His \u2018Disturbing\u2019 New Attack on Kelly", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/08/25/Ailes-Blasts-Trump-His-Disturbing-New-Attack-Kelly", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/Megyn_Kelly_Fox.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/08/25/Ailes-Blasts-Trump-His-Disturbing-New-Attack-Kelly", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/Megyn_Kelly_Fox.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Well, it looks as if the truce is over \u2013 and we\u2019re not talking about last weekend\u2019s d\u00e9", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Ailes, a veteran Republican political pro and TV new impresario, may be on to something in saying that Trump\u2019s obsessive attacks on Kelly are highly disturbing \u2013 and even bizarre.\nAccording to Politico, Bret Baier, who was one of the three moderators of the GOP debate, tweeted, \"It's been 19 days since the debate - @realDonaldTrump has made his feelings clear.\nIt could be a long campaign season for the network if Trump boycotts them while regularly turning up on all their competitors\u2019 news programs.\nFox is still celebrating its ratings from the first debate where Trump emerged as the dominant figure and helped attract 24 million viewers.\nThe big question hanging over this growing feud between the leading GOP presidential candidate and the leading conservative television network is who needs the other more."}
