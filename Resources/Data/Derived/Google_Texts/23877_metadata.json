So you can understand why Democratic partisans have gotten a little shirty over the recent unearthing of notes by Diana Blair, a personal friend of Hillary Clinton, about Monica Lewinsky, and by Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul\u2019s recent efforts to re-litigate the Lewinsky scandal. It is, after all, pretty old news.\n\nThen again, it\u2019s no older than Mitt Romney\u2019s tenure at Bain Capital\u2014a subject that absolutely fascinated Democratic partisans not so long ago. It's certainly fresher news than Richard Nixon\u2014yet when tapes released in 2010 revealed Nixon spouting nonsense about Jews, blacks, Italians, and others back in the 1970s, it was Big News. And Nixon wasn\u2019t even running for public office any longer in 2010 (I checked!).\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean Paul ought to drag Bill Clinton\u2019s indiscretions back into public light. For one thing, Clinton isn\u2019t running for anything, either. For another\u2014and Republicans probably have repressed their memories of this\u2014Gallup reports that \u201cas the Lewinsky situation unfolded, Clinton\u2019s job approval went up, not down, and his ratings remained high for the duration of the impeachment proceedings.\u201d These days the former president is such a beloved figure that bad-mouthing him for anything is like cussing out the Dalai Lama for not wearing a tux to a black-tie dinner: Even if you\u2019re technically right, you still lose.\n\nBesides, Republicans are supposed to care about individual responsibility, and it\u2019s hard to see how Hillary was individually responsible for her husband acting like a hound dog. If Republicans want to rake her over some old coals, they have much better material to use: Hillarycare.\n\nThe ink was still drying on Bill Clinton\u2019s White House stationery in January 1993 when he created a special health care task force and put his wife in charge of it. The task force was supposed to do nothing less than transform the entire American health care system with a plan to guarantee universal coverage for all. And it was supposed to lower medical spending because, as Hillary Clinton put it a few months later, \u201ctoo many people have made too much money\u201d providing health care in the U.S.\n\nMuch about the task force was secret. It met in secret; its membership was secret; its deliberations were secret. And while it did meet with various health care stakeholders, the meetings were described by the chairman of Physicians for a National Health Program as \u201ca magnificent exercise in pseudo-openness.\u201d\n\nThe task force was also gargantuan. As The New York Times reported, \u201cwith more than 500 people, the staff was bigger than 99 percent of all businesses in the United States.\u201d\n\nThat huge staff produced a huge bill: A 1,342-page proposal \u201cof sweeping scope and complexity,\u201d as one academic journal later put it, that would have corralled all Americans into regional health cooperatives. The cooperatives were to negotiate with insurers, set standards for insurance coverage, collect premiums, negotiate with doctors and hospitals, regulate prices, and cap health care spending.\n\nThe plan would also have required every employer to provide health insurance for all employees; required every citizen to have insurance; and done it all through a health maintenance organization (HMO) model. Everything would be supervised by a seven-member National Health Board.\n\nReviews were less than glowing. \u201cUnder these plans, people are driven like cattle from doctor to doctor,\u201d said a Richmond-area doctor, who described the proposal as a \u201chuge, megalithic\" system. \u201cNot since Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s War Production Board,\u201d said The Economist, \u201chas it been suggested that so large a part of the American economy should suddenly be brought under government control.\u201d\n\nEven some of those on the task force thought it was excessive. \u201cI can think of parallels in wartime,\u201d read one internal memo released years later, \u201cbut I have trouble coming up with a precedent in our peacetime history for such broad and centralized control over a sector of the economy.\u201d\n\nA huge public relations battle between supporters and opponents ensued. It ended in a rout. Hillarycare was tossed onto the ash heap of history\u2014but it still had profound consequences. The next year, Republicans won control of both the House and Senate for the first time in four decades, in no small part on the strength of public reaction to Hillarycare.\n\nWhen she ran for president against Obama a decade and a half later, Hillary rolled out a slightly more modest health care plan. This time she pitched it, very carefully, as the \u201cAmerican Health Choices Plan\u201d\u2014despite the fact that it reduced choices by mandating coverage, forbidding insurers to deny coverage, and imposing price controls. Yet as The Washington Post reported at the time, Clinton \u201cemphasized that if people \u2026 currently like their health care plan, her proposal does not require them to change it.\u201d Sound familiar?\n\nMore Americans disapprove of Obamacare than approve of it. This has been the consistent finding since the law first took effect. It is not soothing to realize that, if Hillary Clinton had gotten her way, America now would be saddled with something even worse.\n\nThis column first appeared at the Richmond Times-Dispatch.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Hillarycare was tossed onto the ash heap of history\u2014but it still had profound consequences.", "title": "Obamacare: It Could Be Worse", "url": "http://reason.com/archives/2014/02/24/obamacare-isnt-as-bad-as-hillarycare-was", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/13932533873928.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@reason", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/13932533873928.jpg", "description": "Barack Obama was still a\nfreshman in the Illinois state Senate in 1998, an era when the\ntechnologically advanced were dialing up the World Wide Web over\n56k modems and Netscape Navigator.
