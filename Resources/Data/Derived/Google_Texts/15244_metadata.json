And I don\u2019t just mean in the academic sense \u2014 you learn about who you are, who you\u2019re becoming and, most importantly, who you want to be.\n\nThe people you surround yourself with are crucial to this process. You\u2019ll meet lots of new friends in college, and you\u2019ll have a solid network of high school friends who will be there for you when times get tough \u2014 or so you think.\n\nOur high school friends are our first loves. They were there for us when we stopped wearing choker necklaces and when we had our first kisses. They were our prom dates, our locker buddies and our partners for relay races in gym class.\n\nBut when you go to college, and as you all separate further and further into your own lives, those relationships completely change, and you start having some harsh realizations about the people you once considered your soulmates.\n\nYou\u2019re not obligated to keep in touch with anyone, and no one is obligated to keep in touch with you\n\nThis guilt you\u2019ll feel for losing touch with your high school friends may consume you for a little while, but it\u2019ll go away when you realize you aren\u2019t obligated to stay connected to anyone \u2014 and nobody is obligated to stay connected to you.\n\nDon\u2019t be shocked if the people you thought you\u2019d stay close to end up becoming the biggest strangers. College is a time for growth, newness and exploration. And sometimes, that may come at the expense of leaving some people behind, either accidentally or on purpose.\n\nAfter you graduate high school, you\u2019re no longer trapped in the confines of your hometown. You\u2019re free to do what\u2019s best for you. If that means fully immersing yourself in your new life and being fully present in your new environment, then so be it.\n\nThey\u2019re all Republicans now\n\nEveryone on your Facebook timeline will share weird conservative memes about guns and Obamacare and Caitlyn Jenner, and you\u2019re going to spend four years deciding if that\u2019s grounds for un-friending these people or if you should just keep them around for entertainment purposes.\n\nMaybe this is just my hometown. Ah well.\n\nThat one couple that was supposed to last forever won\u2019t\n\nEvery high school had the couple that convinced everyone true love was real \u2014 the couple that was supposed to get married, have 2.3 kids and live happily ever after with their life insurance and 401k perfectly intact. They were smart, good-looking and admired by everyone.\n\nBut that couple will break up. I promise. And there\u2019s nothing any of you can do about it except collectively mourn the loss of romance \u2014 and stalk each of their new relationships on Facebook.\n\nSome girls won't stop wearing cheetah print or flare jeans, no matter how much time passes\n\nPeople from high school often get stuck in a time capsule of outdated, regional style. It\u2019s just more proof they haven\u2019t left the nest.\n\nYou won\u2019t visit each other as much as you promised you would\n\nRemember all those nights you spent promising your high school friends you\u2019d visit each other on the weekends? That won\u2019t happen.\n\nIt may happen once, if you\u2019re lucky, and with someone who goes to school relatively close to you.\n\nBut other than that, when push comes to shove and your friend wants you to \u201cPick a weekend!\u201d every weekend will be booked with some football game or themed party you won\u2019t want to miss.\n\nYou\u2019ll start to value your time on campus, with people who go to your school, more than you\u2019ll value time with old friends.\n\nThat one guy\u2019s rap career is just not going to take off\n\nYou\u2019ll see him try for years. He\u2019ll post links to his SoundCloud and beg you, his Facebook friend, to like his rapper page. It still won\u2019t happen.\n\nYou\u2019ll be happy for your friends when they post major life changes to Facebook, but also surprised at how disconnected you feel from them\n\nSome of your high school friends will go on to do great things. They\u2019ll get married, have children and land their dream jobs. And then, because this is how life works now, they\u2019ll probably post about it on Facebook.\n\nYou\u2019ll read their statuses and smile for them, but then you\u2019ll feel a bit melancholy when you realize how disengaged you are from their lives, how you\u2019re light-years away from where they are and what they\u2019re doing.\n\nThe popular girls are all working at the gym and going to community college\n\nThe star quarterback is now a fat loser, the prom king is balding and the class president is a drug addict. Nothing will make sense (or, better yet, it\u2019ll make all the sense in the world).\n\nYou\u2019ll feel like you have nothing in common anymore\n\nWhen you go away to college, you won\u2019t believe how much you\u2019ll change.\n\nLiving on your own in a totally new environment and being responsible for yourself forces you to grow up quickly. Plus, you\u2019ll be surrounded by people from all walks of life, with all kinds of new hobbies, life experiences and tastes in music that are bound to rub off on you.\n\nIt only takes a few months of immersing yourself in a completely new environment for you to realize you had a lot of changing to do. And once you do start changing, you may not have as much in common with your high school friends anymore.\n\nAll of this might sound scary, but it\u2019s actually wonderful. You\u2019re becoming who you\u2019re supposed to be!
