Carly Fiorina’s nascent presidential campaign is running into more trouble on the Internet.

Hours after the former Hewlett-Packard CEO appeared on NBC’s “Late Night with Seth Meyers," the network blocked her campaign’s attempt to post a clip from the show on YouTube.

“This video contains content from NBC Universal, who has blocked it on copyright grounds,” an error message on the clip said on Wednesday morning.

The stumble comes after Fiorina’s campaign captured early headlines for failing to buy up CarlyFiorina.org. Instead of linking to the Republican White House hopeful’s campaign, the site — registered by a union employee in their off time — criticizes layoffs that occurred over the course of Fiorina’s tenure at HP.

While NBC Universal had taken down the full 7-minute clip of Fiorina on Meyers’s show, it did not take action against a shorter video of Fiorina explaining how she had bought SethMeyers.org.
