(Photo: Mark Mahan/Special to The Courier-Journal)Buy Photo\n\nDr. Andrew Moore II is a retired plastic surgeon, but he also could be called a visionary and a pioneer.\n\nWhen the Lexington physician decided to start Surgery on Sunday in 2005 to provide poor Kentuckians with free outpatient surgical care, there was no blueprint for him to use as a guide.\n\nStill, he cobbled together a successful program that has flourished over the last decade, serving between 5,000 and 6,000 patients from Kentucky \u2014 and beyond \u2014 since it began.\n\n\"They're extremely grateful,\" he said.\n\nTypical patients are the working poor who can\u2019t afford basic medical procedures, such as hernia repairs and cataract surgery, to help them lead more productive, happy lives.\n\n\"They are people that the health-care system has failed,\" Moore said, \"and really, a lot of them have given up ... until they hear about us.\"\n\nFor coming to their aid, Moore will be honored as the Kentucky Humanitarian of the Year on Saturday at the Muhammad Ali Humanitarian Awards. The awards \u201ccelebrate the greatness of people from around the world who are making differences in their communities and beyond,\u201d according to the Muhammad Ali Center.\n\nThere\u2019s \u201cno more deserving man than Andy Moore,\u201d said Dr. Paul Anthony Kearney, a general surgeon who succeeded Moore as Surgery on Sunday chair. \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody realizes the complexities of initiating an outpatient surgery program where the entire thing is free. \u2026 There are hundreds of moving parts to this thing, and he managed to put it all together in a vision he had to do this for the community. It\u2019s pretty amazing.\u201d\n\nThe program serves not only uninsured people but others who struggle despite the Affordable Care Act, which is sometimes referred to as Obamacare.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s thousands of people that fall through the ACA cracks,\u201d Kearney said. They include \u201cillegal aliens. People from other states,\u201d and \u201cthere are people now who have health insurance, but they have $12,000 deductibles\u201d that they can't afford. \"\u2026 We\u2019ve opened the program up to those people.\"\n\nAfter years of struggling with her poor vision, Lisa Clark, 54, of Lexington recently had cataracts removed from both eyes thanks to Surgery on Sunday.\n\nBuy Photo Lisa Clark received free cataract surgery through the Surgery on Sunday program in Lexington. (Photo: Mark Mahan/Special to The Courier-Journal)\n\n\u201cI\u2019m tickled pink. I can see again,\u201d said the disabled grandmother who likes to sew and crochet.\n\nClark has insurance but couldn\u2019t afford its $5,500 deductible. \u201cMy right eye was so bad (that) for me to actually see out of my left eye, I had to close my right eye,\u201d she said.\n\nThe people with Surgery on Sunday \u201cwere all awesome,\" she said. \"I can\u2019t say enough good things about them.\"\n\nMoore, 67, decided to start the program after it became increasingly difficult to get help for the needy, a population that he, his father and brothers always had tried to care for.\n\n\u201cI come from a long lineage of doctors and when I first started in Lexington in the early '80s, we never turned down people because they didn\u2019t have money,\u201d Moore said. \u201cIt was relatively easy to get them taken care of. If you saw that they didn\u2019t have money, you would call the hospital and say, 'Look, I\u2019m bringing in this patient that I\u2019m going to have to do for free because they don\u2019t have the resources, and would you be glad to take care of them?' and it was one phone call. It was a pretty simple process. \u2026 However, as HMOs and all that stuff started coming in, and PPOs, it became more complicated to get the hospital to allow you to do that, and so I felt that we needed to do it in a more organized fashion.\u201d\n\nRight now, surgeries are being done every other month, with most of the procedures taking place at space donated by KentuckyOne Health at the Lexington Surgery Center, Kearney said. Services range from skin cancer removal to ear tubes for children.\n\n\u201cIn a given Sunday, there may be 10 to 15 physicians there, but there are probably 80 other people that are making it happen,\u201d Moore said.\n\nMoore credits the volunteers when speaking about the Ali award. He's being honored along with Hollywood luminaries, such as entertainer and social activist Harry Belafonte, and other achievers.\n\nBuy Photo Dr. Andy Moore, left, dictated information about the hand surgery he had just performed as part of the Surgery on Sunday program. Moore, the program's founder, said providing the services in Lexington \"is just pure joy.\" (Photo: Pam Spaulding/The Courier-Journal)\n\n\u201cCertainly, it\u2019s a great honor,\u201d Moore said. \u201cFrom my standpoint, I know that Surgery on Sunday is 400 volunteers; it\u2019s not one individual such as myself. I really accept this award on behalf of all those volunteers and the patients that have endured a failed health-care system. \u2026 It validates what we\u2019re doing, and it gives us an opportunity to get a little recognition and get our message out there.\u201d\n\nPatients generally are referred to the program by a primary care provider and live within a 250-mile radius of Lexington. People from farther away are accepted on a case-by-case basis.\n\nCentral Kentuckians were the original focus of the program, Moore said, \u201cbut it became pretty obvious that the problem was larger than that. We were seeing people from other communities outside our area, and it\u2019s hard to turn down somebody that can get to you.\u201d\n\nAs a result, \u201cwe\u2019ve actually taken care of people from every single county in the state of Kentucky, from Paducah to Pikeville \u2014 wherever \u2014 and we\u2019ve also taken care of people from the surrounding states, including Illinois, Indiana, West Virginia, Tennessee (and) South Carolina,\" Moore said.\n\nPrivate donations help to fund the nonprofit program, which gets drugs and materials donated by companies, and networks with various indigent clinics.\n\nGeneral surgeons do the bulk of procedures, Moore said, but there also are many other professionals, such as ear, nose and throat doctors, neurosurgeons, orthopedic specialists, and gynecologists, who also donate their time and talents. Moore's mother is a greeter, and students also have been known to volunteer for various tasks.\n\n\u201cI think once you get somebody to participate in this one time and they see how worthwhile it is and how much fun it is and the joy that you derive from that, you\u2019ve got them hooked,\" Moore said. \"It\u2019s an easy sell after that.\u201d\n\nShirley Ramsey, who has been the program\u2019s clinical coordinator since the beginning, said Moore is a pied piper who draws people to him. She first observed his compassion for patients while working with him as a nurse at St. Joseph Hospital. He and his brothers would take the worst cases, regardless of the patients' income, Ramsey said.\n\n\u201cHe is humble. He\u2019s smart. He takes care of his patients like he would take care of his family, and he treats the people that support him \u2014 the nurses, the techs, the anesthesiologists \u2014 ... with high regard,\u201d Ramsey said. \u201cHe treats everybody like they\u2019re an integral part of the plan.\"\n\nThe program has spawned others, such as Surgery on Sunday Louisville, which was founded by Dr. Erica Sutton in 2013. To her, Moore is an inspiration, and she's pleased to see him receiving the humanitarian award.\n\nDr. Fred P.

As a part-time dog groomer without health insurance, she couldn't afford to get the procedure done on her own.\n\n\u201cEveryone there made you feel so welcome and they didn\u2019t make you feel bad because you couldn\u2019t afford the surgery,\" said Eiseman, a Lexington native who stayed with family in Kentucky during her recovery.\n\nBecause of incontinence, Eiseman had missed out on playing tag and soccer with her two girls. But \u201cI can run around at the park with my children now,\u201d she said.\n\nThe gratitude of patients is Moore's true reward. \u201cMany of them are sobbing by the time it\u2019s over, and it\u2019s hard not to react with them because they are such a grateful population,\" he said. \"Their thank you and their handshake or hug means more than the money you would have gotten from it otherwise.\u201d\n\nReporter Darla Carter can be reached at (502) 582-7068, dcarter@courier-journal.com or on Facebook at DarlaCarterCJ.
