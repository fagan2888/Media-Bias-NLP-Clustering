At press time, an attempt to go to the Indiana Right to Life website yields an \u201cUnable to connect\u201d error and it does not load properly.\n\nHackers took Indiana Right to Life\u2019s website offline Tuesday evening, possibly in retaliation for the organization\u2019s support of Indiana\u2019s Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), which the pro-life group strongly supported to protects the rights of pro-life medical professionals from having to be involved in abortions and to protect companies like Hobby Lobby from having to pay for abortion-causing drugs for their employees.\n\nCLICK LIKE IF YOU\u2019RE PRO-LIFE!\n\nIRTL informed LifeNews.com that a Twitter user claimed responsibility, using the same hashtag \u2013 #Offline \u2013 as was used by the apparent hacker who disrupted the state of Indiana\u2019s website on Friday.\n\n\u201cWe face bitter opposition to our work protecting the unborn every day, but most who oppose our mission do so in the open,\u201d said Mike Fichter, President and CEO of Indiana Right to Life.\n\nFichter told LifeNews.com: \u201cThis attack on our website is cowardly. We have been exercising our freedom of speech as we support the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which is an important safeguard for pro-life Hoosiers against government directives supporting abortion. This attack appears to be in retaliation for that support. It\u2019s disappointing that the level of discourse has been lowered by a party wishing to silence our voice.\u201d\n\nThe president of the pro-life group said Indiana Right to Life is working with its web team to get the site back up and running.\n\nPence signed into law Indiana\u2019s historic Religious Freedom Restoration Act, enabling new protections for pro-life persons, businesses and ministries from being forced to support abortion.\n\n\u201cToday I signed the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, because I support the freedom of religion for every Hoosier of every faith,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe Constitution of the United States and the Indiana Constitution both provide strong recognition of the freedom of religion but today, many people of faith feel their religious liberty is under attack by government action.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne need look no further than the recent litigation concerning the Affordable Care Act. A private business and our own University of Notre Dame had to file lawsuits challenging provisions that required them to offer insurance coverage in violation of their religious views,\u201d he added. \u201cLast year the Supreme Court of the United States upheld religious liberty in the Hobby Lobby case based on the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act, but that act does not apply to individual states or local government action.\u201d\n\nFichter attended the bill signing ceremony as Governor Pence signed the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), SB 101, into law. The pro-life group, in an email to LifeNews.com, applauded the governor.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hackers Protesting Indiana's Religious Freedom Restoration Act Attack Pro-Life Website", "og": {"site_name": "LifeNews.com", "description": "Liberals and abortion advocates nationwide are targeting Indiana for protests after pro-life Governor Mike Pence signed into law a bill helping the state protec", "title": "Hackers Protesting Indiana\u2019s Religious Freedom Restoration Act Attack Pro-Life Website", "url": "http://www.lifenews.com/2015/04/01/hackers-protesting-indianas-religious-freedom-restoration-act-attack-pro-life-website/", "image": "http://www.lifenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/religiousfreedom4.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 204509779594999}, "OBKey": "avejq02j7xRr+0owuq+Pcw==", "keywords": "hackers protesting indiana\\'s religious freedom restoration act attack pro-life website", "google-site-verification": "PPPx-GD0i7nWjUFAYnFdOYorAAJLuNyKOl23JCeXyrQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "\u201cToday I signed the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, because I support the freedom of religion for every Hoosier of every faith,\u201d he said.\n\u201cLast year the Supreme Court of the United States upheld religious liberty in the Hobby Lobby case based on the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act, but that act does not apply to individual states or local government action.\u201dFichter attended the bill signing ceremony as Governor Pence signed the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), SB 101, into law.\nNow, days after Indiana\u2019s website was disrupted following the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) becoming law, pro-abortion liberals have hacked the web site of the pro-life group Indiana Right to Life.\nPence signed into law Indiana\u2019s historic Religious Freedom Restoration Act, enabling new protections for pro-life persons, businesses and ministries from being forced to support abortion.\nWe have been exercising our freedom of speech as we support the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which is an important safeguard for pro-life Hoosiers against government directives supporting abortion."}
