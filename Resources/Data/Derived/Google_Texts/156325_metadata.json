R. Frye, who went public with a stunning admission that the VA likely wastes $6 billion a year on unnecessary contracts, purchases and services.\n\n\u201cDoors are swung wide open for fraud, waste and abuse,\u201d Mr. Frye, the deputy assistant secretary for acquisition and logistics, wrote in a whistleblower letter that made national headlines.\n\nThe examples backing up Mr. Frye\u2019s claims just keep piling up:\n\n\u2022 The VA\u2019s inspector general reported that the agency's human resources department wasted $6.1 million on two conferences in Orlando, Florida, that treated employees more to vacation than to training.\n\n\u2022 The inspector general also divulged in that report that department officials wasted $97,906 on trinkets like bags, pens and water that were unnecessary. VA employees also improperly accepted gifts including room upgrades, meals, limousine services, golf, spa services, helicopter rides and tickets to see the Rockettes.\n\n\u2022 In July, an employee at the Rhode Island Veterans Memorial Cemetery in Exeter pled guilty to stealing 150 marble headstones from a veterans cemetery in a scheme that went unnoticed for a long time.\n\n\u2022 In June, a former head engineer at the VA hospital in East Orange, New Jersey, was accused of taking $1.2 million in kickbacks for contracts, which fleeced taxpayers.\n\n\u2022 The VA\u2019s inspector general found last month that the Veterans Benefits Administration mismanaged millions of dollars in benefits for veterans who were unable to manage their own income and estates due to age, injury or disability. Among the woes cited in the report was a failure to remove two custodians who had misspent benefit funds.\n\n\u2022 In testimony before Congress in May, Mr. Frye cited reports that VA employees in the Bronx in New York City had swiped charge cards 2,000 times, saying they were buying prosthetic legs and arms for veterans. Each charge was for $24,999, one dollar below the VA\u2019s charging limit for purchase cards. When lawmakers demanded details about the charges, they were told there was no documentation.\n\nFor wasting federal tax dollars intended to help veterans who deserve the best health care money can buy after their service to this country, the Department of Veterans Affairs wins this weeks Golden Hammer, a weekly distinction awarded by The Washington Times highlighting the most egregious examples of wasteful federal spending.\n\nThe recent record of VA woes frustrates spending watchdogs, because the agency claims it needs more money to clear backlogs of cases for veterans waiting for benefit determinations.\n\n\u201cAt a time when the VA has a massive backlog in getting veterans health care and getting veterans paperwork processed so they can see a doctor, it is obscene that they are wasting money on self congratulatory conferences,\u201d said Richard Manning, president of Americans for Limited Government, a spending watchdog.\n\nFollowing initial reports in 2014 that 40 veterans had died while waiting for health care at the Phoenix, Arizona, VA hospital, lawmakers, veterans groups and watchdogs called for President Obama to fire top VA officials and have echoed those cries since.\n\nIn May 2014, Dr. Robert Petzel, the VA\u2019s top health official retired early at the request of then-VA Secretary Eric Shinseki, who resigned later that month.\n\n\u201cThe failure of the Obama administration to fire VA officials for continuing to waste billions of taxpayer dollars intended to provide health care for our nation\u2019s veterans shows the disregard our selfie-obsessed president has for those who fought to preserve our nation\u2019s freedom,\u201d Mr. Manning said.\n\nA VA spokesperson declined comment on the Hammer, instead referring a reporter to VA Secretary Robert McDonald\u2019s statement this spring.\n\n\u201cVA\u2019s priority is to provide needed health care to the Veterans we serve. We work with tens of thousands of health care providers in communities across the country using the acquisition tools most appropriate for VA and the provider to deliver that care. It is clear that serious allegations have been made regarding VA\u2019s purchase authorities and we are working diligently to review them,\u201d he said at the time.\n\nMr. Frye told lawmakers in May he went public only after he had brought his concerns over the VA\u2019s financial mismanagement to Mr. McDonald in the form of a 35-page memorandum in March but heard nothing back from him for seven weeks.\n\n\u201cI took to heart the Secretary\u2019s invitation for \u2018whistle blowers\u2019 to step forward,\u201d Mr. Frye wrote in his letter, referring to Mr. McDonald\u2019s request for VA employees to speak up about issues within the department during the fallout from the scandal in Phoenix.\n\nShortly after Mr. Frye released his letter Mr. McDonald told Government Executive that Mr. Frye\u2019s memo was \u201cjust showing what he needs to improve, so I\u2019m excited about him improving that.\u201d\n\nHe acknowledged that waste within the department\u2019s procurement office was a long-standing problem, but stopped short of taking responsibility for it. He said it was Mr. Frye\u2019s \u201cresponsibility to fix it,\u201d and added the department \u201chas a lot of work to do.\u201d\n\nMembers of Congress are losing patience with the VA. House Veterans Affairs\u2019 Committee Chairman Jeff Miller, Florida Republican, went to the House floor in July to urge his colleagues to take more aggressive actions and create greater accountability inside an agency that seemed reluctant to punish its own for repeated failure.\n\nThe VA is \u201cfailing and continuing to fail,\u201d Mr. Miller said. \u201cThe veterans deserve better. The status quo doesn\u2019t work. Are you going to stand with the veterans or the bureaucrats? I know where your hearts are \u2014 it\u2019s with the veterans, and of course it\u2019s with the employees and the people. But there are some rotten people that work in the department that need to be fired, not protected.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The federal agency entrusted to stretch tax dollars as far as they can go to get veterans the best medical care, in fact, has a hard time spending tax dollars wisely.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The federal agency entrusted to stretch tax dollars as far as they can go to get veterans the best medical care, in fact, has a hard time spending tax dollars wisely.", "title": "Golden Hammer: VA\u2019s record of waste, fraud, abuse keeps piling up", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/sep/3/golden-hammer-vas-record-of-waste-fraud-abuse-keep/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/20/hammertime_2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/20/hammertime_2.jpg", "description": "The federal agency entrusted to stretch tax dollars as far as they can go to get veterans the best medical care, in fact, has a hard time spending tax dollars wisely.", "card": "summary", "title": "Golden Hammer: VA\u2019s record of waste, fraud, abuse keeps piling u"}, "Author": "Kellan Howell", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Social Issues, Health Medical Pharma, Department Of Veterans Affairs, R Frye"}, "article_summary": "\u201cDoors are swung wide open for fraud, waste and abuse,\u201d Mr. Frye, the deputy assistant secretary for acquisition and logistics, wrote in a whistleblower letter that made national headlines.\nVA employees also improperly accepted gifts including room upgrades, meals, limousine services, golf, spa services, helicopter rides and tickets to see the Rockettes.\n\u201cVA\u2019s priority is to provide needed health care to the Veterans we serve.\nA VA spokesperson declined comment on the Hammer, instead referring a reporter to VA Secretary Robert McDonald\u2019s statement this spring.\nI know where your hearts are \u2014 it\u2019s with the veterans, and of course it\u2019s with the employees and the people."}
