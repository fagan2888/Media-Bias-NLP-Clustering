The singularly annoying obstructionist has real staying power, and he\u2019s as well-positioned as any of the candidates moving forward. The more Cruz irks his opponents, the more he grandstands, the more entrenched and profitable his campaign becomes.\n\nEven Cruz\u2019s Republican colleagues appear resigned to this fact. \u201cTed Cruz has been branded a \u2018wacko bird\u2019 by a Senate colleague,\u201d write Katie Zezima and David Weigel in the Washington Post. \u201cA GOP consultant labeled him a show horse, and a strategist for a rival presidential campaign call him the Mitt Romney of 2016 \u2013 the Republican no other Republican can stand.\u201d\n\nHarsh words indeed, but none of this matters to Cruz. He knows he\u2019s hated by his colleagues in the Senate and by establishment Republicans in general. But this is a good thing for Cruz. Being loathed by those responsible for governing plays right into his \u201coutsider\u201d narrative. When then-Speaker Boehner called Cruz a \u201cjackass\u201d earlier this year, he responded by saying, \u201cI will wear it as a badge of honor because I refuse to join their club.\u201d The \u201cclub,\u201d I presume, is everyone in Washington making a serious effort to navigate the challenges of policymaking in a partisan climate.\n\nUnderstanding this is key to understanding Cruz\u2019s appeal. There\u2019s a huge swath of the conservative base that doesn\u2019t want to fix Washington so much as explode it (politically speaking, of course). Every time one of those Washington politicians (the \u201cWashington cartel,\u201d as Cruz is fond of saying) criticizes Cruz for his self-serving obstinacy, he capitalizes by sending out fundraising emails touting his anti-establishment credentials. And it\u2019s working.\n\nSo far the race has unfolded perfectly for Cruz. His only path to the nomination is as an outsider, someone who can appeal to religious and anti-government conservatives. Cruz is playing the long game right now. He\u2019s comfortably in fourth place in the national polls, just behind Trump, Carson and Rubio.\n\nCruz\u2019s bet, however, is that Trump and Carson eventually collapse. Although it\u2019s possible that Trump and Carson hang around until the convention, it\u2019s not the most likely scenario. Trump has proven himself vulnerable in recent months, and one suspects his farcical adventure could end at any moment. The RNC also knows Trump would be a disaster as a general election candidate, and they\u2019ll do everything possible to torpedo his campaign. I\u2019m not confident they can stop Trump, but it remains to be seen.", "article_metadata": {"description": "He may be a longshot, but the anti-establishmentarian is on the ascent.
