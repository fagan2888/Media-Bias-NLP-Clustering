John Kasich as an \u201cObama Republican.\u201d\n\nSince Kasich has gained in the polls in New Hampshire, American Future Fund has decided to run an ad that slams the Ohio governor for supporting the Common Core standards and expanding Medicaid under Obamacare. The ad refers to Kasich as \u201cone of the few Republican governors to cheerlead Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion.\u201d It closes with the statement: \u201cJohn Kasich \u2013 Not a conservative. Not even a moderate. An Obama Republican.\u201d\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nPresident of the American Future Fund Nick Ryan said the ad will air on broadcast and cable television in New Hampshire, as well as into the Boston media market, reports the New York Times. On Monday, Kasich was endorsed by the Boston Globe.\n\nSpokesman for Kasich Rob Nichols called the ad an \u201cunprincipled smear\u201d because Kasich had been opposed to Obamacare and favored limits on federal intervention in education.\n\nKasich actually referred to grassroots parent activists in his state who were opposed to Common Core as \u201ca runaway internet campaign,\u201d and to their efforts to rid Ohio of Common Core, he said it was \u201chysteria.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a testament to Governor Kasich\u2019s continued strength that these shadowy, desperate, misleading attacks are now emerging,\u201d Nichols said, the Times reports.\n\nRyan said, nevertheless, that Kasich had been \u201cmisleading New Hampshire voters\u201d about his record. \u201cThe real John Kasich record looks like something you might expect from a liberal politician like Barack Obama, not a Republican governor.\u201d\n\nKasich is expected to leave Iowa after the GOP debate and head to New Hampshire where his campaign says he will remain until after the New Hampshire primary on February 9, says the Washington Post.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A national conservative group intends to spend $1 million on ads in New Hampshire that refer to GOP 2016 contender John Kasich as an \u201cObama Republican.\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "A national conservative group intends to spend $1 million on ads in New Hampshire that refer to GOP 2016 contender John Kasich as an \u201cObama Republican.\u201d", "title": "Conservative Ad Brands John Kasich as \u2018Obama Republican\u2019 - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/01/john-kasich-smiling-Getty.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/01/27/conservative-ad-brands-john-kasich-as-obama-republican/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A national conservative group intends to spend $1 million on ads in New Hampshire that refer to GOP 2016 contender John Kasich as an \u201cObama Republican.\u201d", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/01/john-kasich-smiling-Getty.jpg", "title": "Conservative Ad Brands John Kasich as \u2018Obama Republican\u2019 - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "2016 GOP Presidential Primaries, boston globe, Common Core, Education, Establishment GOP, John Kasich, Medicaid expansion, Medicare, New Hampshire 2016 presidential primary, Obama,2016 Presidential Race, Big Government, Obamacare,John Kasich", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "tag": "Obama", "published_time": "2016-01-27T19:30:08-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,2016 Presidential Race,Obamacare"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "The ad refers to Kasich as \u201cone of the few Republican governors to cheerlead Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion.\u201d It closes with the statement: \u201cJohn Kasich \u2013 Not a conservative.\nJohn Kasich as an \u201cObama Republican.\u201dSince Kasich has gained in the polls in New Hampshire, American Future Fund has decided to run an ad that slams the Ohio governor for supporting the Common Core standards and expanding Medicaid under Obamacare.\nSpokesman for Kasich Rob Nichols called the ad an \u201cunprincipled smear\u201d because Kasich had been opposed to Obamacare and favored limits on federal intervention in education.\nRyan said, nevertheless, that Kasich had been \u201cmisleading New Hampshire voters\u201d about his record.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERA national conservative group intends to spend $1 million on ads in New Hampshire that refer to GOP 2016 contender Gov."}
