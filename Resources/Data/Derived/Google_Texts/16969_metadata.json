Feb. 6, 2016 (Photo: Scott Utterback/The CJ )Buy Photo\n\nAnti-abortion advocates rallied in front of the new Planned Parenthood on Seventh Street on Saturday to oppose the clinic\u2019s attempts to offer abortion services and the placement of the facility \u201con the doorstep of west Louisville.\u201d\n\n\"It is really not healthy for our community to have another abortion mill located right in the heart of the inner city,\" said Sisters for Life President Angela Minter, one of the rally's organizers. \" ... I believe it undermines the morals of our community and encourages irresponsibility, for the black community in particular, because a lot of people are uninformed about the disproportionate havoc that abortion is having on the black community.\u201d\n\nIt was a sentiment echoed by other members of the black community in attendance, including Rick Howland, 68, who lives in the Algonquin area.\n\n\u201cEighty-some-odd percent of Planned Parenthood\u2019s facilities are always in minority neighborhoods,\" he said. \"They don\u2019t put them out in St. Matthews.\u201d\n\nA spokeswoman from Planned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky said in a statement that \"in many instances, we are the sole provider of essential health care for underserved populations living in the commonwealth,\" but she declined to comment further about the protesters' claims.\n\nHowever, Betty Cockrum, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky, said during a recent visit to Louisville that Planned Parenthood needed a larger facility so it raised money to buy and renovate a former warehouse on Seventh Street to ensure a \"quiet, inviting, private place\" for patients.\n\nOnce it moved to the new facility that replaced its former office on South Second Street, it applied for the license as a health clinic that would include abortion services, she said. Planned Parenthood has since suspended abortion services temporarily while it tries to resolve a dispute about the clinic's license application with the administration of Gov. Matt Bevin.\n\nKentucky previously had only one abortion provider, a private clinic in Louisville that also operates a part-time clinic in Lexington.\n\nSaturday's event, which drew about 200 people total, attracted a small group of pro-abortion rights advocates who \u201cfelt sick\u201d after hearing that the message of the anti-abortion rally would not recognize \u201cthe care that happens\u201d in Planned Parenthood clinics, said Sara Wood, 28, of Germantown. The people who use Planned Parenthood are \u201chealthy women, happy women,\u201d she said, who rely on the clinic for things like intrauterine devices and other forms of birth control.\n\nShe carried a sign that read \u201cCharm is deceptive and beauty is vain \u2026 but a woman without rights ain\u2019t playin\u2019.\u201d She and other protesters danced to a playlist of female musicians \u2013 \u201ccelebrating our lady-ness,\u201d Wood said.\n\nWhile the dancing drew momentary ire from a couple nearby anti-abortion protestors, interaction between the two groups was limited. There was no exchange of obscenities or hostility like John Sohl, the president of Louisville\u2019s Pro-Life Future, had seen at other events.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been videos of people cussing each other out, having obscene gestures and all the negativity, and we don\u2019t want that,\u201d said Sohl, 25. \u201cUnfortunately, by its very nature, this is a controversial issue. We get that. But that is not our intention. We have to call attention to the negative, but ultimately, ... I hope most everyone here is trying to get across a message of hope, truth, beauty, goodness and freedom.\u201d\n\nReporter Kirsten Clark can be reached at (502) 582-4144.
