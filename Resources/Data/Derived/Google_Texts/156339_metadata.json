The heir apparent, majority leader Kevin McCarthy, took himself out of the running. The most logical substitute, Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin \u2014 a onetime vice-presidential candidate with thoughts of a future run for the White House in his head \u2014 is so far declining to volunteer for what has become a miserable, career-threatening job.\n\nAmericans not familiar with the inside baseball of Washington ponder how 40 Republicans can prevent a speaker from being elected when 247 of the House\u2019s 435 members represent the Republican Party.\n\nThe obvious answer is that 218 votes are required to elect a speaker, and when you subtract 40 votes, the math doesn\u2019t work. But underlying that arithmetic is a deep political dysfunction.\n\nThe 40 members of the so-called House Freedom Caucus are bullying their platform through obstruction. They view any congressional achievement \u2014 even one as essential as funding the government \u2014 as an unacceptable concession to President Barack Obama and Democrats in Congress.\n\nRep. Mick Mulvaney, a Republican from South Carolina, told National Public Radio that the caucus wants a speaker who will pretty much give them free rein. They want more control over what bills come up for a vote, what amendments get added and who gets to chair committees. In short, they want a House where the playing field has been leveled and the speaker doesn\u2019t have so much power. It would be a lot like allowing the kindergartners to run the elementary school.\n\nSome of their views are actually held by a majority of Republicans. Boehner permitted the House to take countless futile votes to repeal the Affordable Care Act. But on matters such as immigration, hard liners have brought Congress to a standstill.\n\nBoehner, McCarthy and other Republicans have treated these extremists with far too much deference. They fear more moderate members being \u201cpostcarded\u201d during election season by powerful political groups who share the same unreasonable views as the congressional troublemakers. Those groups hold a great deal of sway over our political process, and the nation is the worse for it.\n\nThe Freedom Caucus is many things, but it is not strategic. Its obstinacy has forced Boehner to seek Democratic cooperation for certain votes, which only infuriates the rebels even more. They seem to have no long game in mind, other than bullying the congressional agenda further to the right.\n\nMost Americans don\u2019t want a Congress that acts this way. They want their elected representatives to go to Washington and work together to solve problems and move the country forward.\n\nFor the moment though, this is what we have: dysfunction and gridlock, brought on by Republican intraparty feuding. Unfortunately, gerrymandered congressional districts and the outsized role of money in politics are making it very hard to move government back to the middle.\n\nIn an interview with National Review columnist Rich Lowry, McCarthy reflected on whether the House was governable. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes you have to hit rock bottom.\u201d\n\nWitnessing the disarray, the bluster, the befuddlement, the public humiliation and the stalled agendas in Washington, it\u2019s difficult to think we\u2019re not already there.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.\n\nDisqus", "article_metadata": {"geo.region": "US-IL", "DC.rights": "Civitas Media", "geo.placename": "Alton", "og": {"site_name": "The Telegraph", "description": "The dirty laundry of the U.S. House, now on full display, is what piles up when elected officials place narrow interests and grudges ahead of the business of governing.A small caucus of about 40 Republican extremists have managed over the past couple of weeks to compel a worn-out House speaker, John Boehner, to announce his [...]", "locality": "Alton", "url": "http://thetelegraph.com/opinion/72575/politics-of-cliques-is-not-government-for-all-the-people", "image": "thetelegraph.com/images/fbimage.png", "title": "Politics of cliques is not government for all the people", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "region": "US-IL"}, "DC.type": "Text", "twitter": {"site": "@altontelegraph", "card": "summary", "title": "- The Telegraph - thetelegraph.com"}, "DC.format": "text/html", "DC.contributor": "The Telegraph", "DC.publisher": "The Telegraph", "DC.identifier": "http://thetelegraph.com", "DC.relation": "http://dublincore.org/", "DC.language": "en_US", "article": {"section": "Opinion", "published_time": "2015-10-16T15:47:08+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-16T15:47:08+00:00", "author": "http://thetelegraph.com/author/englewoodindependent"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "DC.title": "The Telegraph, Alton IL - www.thetelegraph.com"}, "article_summary": "The obvious answer is that 218 votes are required to elect a speaker, and when you subtract 40 votes, the math doesn\u2019t work.\nUnfortunately, gerrymandered congressional districts and the outsized role of money in politics are making it very hard to move government back to the middle.\nA small caucus of about 40 Republican extremists have managed over the past couple of weeks to compel a worn-out House speaker, John Boehner, to announce his retirement.\nThe 40 members of the so-called House Freedom Caucus are bullying their platform through obstruction.\nIn short, they want a House where the playing field has been leveled and the speaker doesn\u2019t have so much power."}
