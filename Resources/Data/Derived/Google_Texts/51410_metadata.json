Ted Cruz has recognized how hard getting the Republican presidential nomination will be if he doesn\u2019t win one of the critical early primaries or caucuses.\n\nBut as the crowded Republican field gets even more cramped, Cruz\u2019s campaign team plans to pick up as many delegates as possible in other states\u2013enough to keep him in the race until the Republican National Convention, according to Politico.\n\nThis strategy hinges on top-three performances in the three earliest states\u2013Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina\u2013and success in Massachusetts, Georgia, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas and Michigan, which are tentatively scheduled to vote in early March.\n\nIf no candidate has a winning share of delegates by the convention, it\u2019ll be the first time that\u2019s happened in almost 40 years. Then, Cruz would need to earn enough delegates from other candidates to reach the 1,236 needed to clinch the nomination.\n\nCruz stumps on border security, Obamacare in Rio Grande Valley\n\nThe senator spent Tuesday in Edinburg and McAllen for a briefing on border security and a fundraiser for his presidential campaign, according to the Texas Tribune.\n\nCruz, who\u2019s visited the Democratic stronghold four times as a senator, told reporters it\u2019s important for his 2016 rivals to visit here \u201cto address seriously the problem of securing the border and to have a serious plan and to demonstrate a willingness to enforce the law.\u201d\n\nHe later attended a private fundraiser at McAllen\u2019s International Museum of Art & Science hosted by Lawrence Gelman, a local anesthesiologist. Cruz crafted his speech to mostly medical professionals\u2013each of which paid at least $1,000 to attend\u2013around his promise to repeal Obamacare, according to the Tribune.\n\nPresident Cruz: A preview\n\nThere is still a lot of time before the start of a possible Cruz presidency, but the senator told the Washington Post what he\u2019d do in his first 100 days in the White House:\n\nPush Congress to repeal Obamacare and establish a flat tax (to get rid of the IRS)\n\nRevoke every executive order from President Barack Obama that Cruz\u2019s team deems unconstitutional\n\nReview ways to make sure Iran doesn\u2019t obtain a nuclear weapon\n\nStop using federal funds as incentives for states to adopt Common Core education requirements\n\nMove the United States embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem\n\nCruz, during a New Hampshire town hall last week, also promised to send reporters flowers and condolence notes, and to hold a Cuban pig roast on the White House South Lawn for Christmas Eve.", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RyYWlsYmxhemVyc2Jsb2cuZGFsbGFzbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxNS8wNi9jcnV6LXJvdW5kdXAtY291bnRpbmctb24tbWFyY2gtZG93bi1pbi10aGUtdmFsbGV5LWZpcnN0LTEwMC1kYXlzLmh0bWwv", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Sylvan Lane", "og": {"site_name": "Trail Blazers Blog", "description": "WASHINGTON--Sen.
