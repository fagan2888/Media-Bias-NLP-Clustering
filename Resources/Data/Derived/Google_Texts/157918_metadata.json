You at least have to be a mayor or something!\u201d\n\n\u201cHe knows how to work the media, but I don\u2019t think that will make him a good president,\u201d Gray added of Trump. \u201cI\u2019m a fan of immigration. I understand that there has to be harsher screening considering everything that\u2019s going on, but Trump is talking about doing things like building walls, and that\u2019s such an ancient idea.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t Gray\u2019s first foray into holiday songs; the singer released a cover of \u201cThis Christmas\u201d in 2001.\n\nCheck out Macy Gray\u2019s version of \u201cAll I Want for Christmas\u201d above.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Macy Gray has an updated version of \"All I Want for Christmas\" out for the holidays\u2014but her Christmas wish list may be too much for Santa.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Macy Gray has an updated version of \"All I Want for Christmas\" out for the holidays\u2014but her Christmas wish list may be too much for Santa.", "title": "Singer Macy Gray Updates Holiday Classic: \u2018All I Want for Christmas\u2019 Is No Trump, Gun Control, Free Healthcare, Legal Pot", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/12/macy-gray-performance-Getty.jpg", "height": 480}, "updated_time": "2015-12-06T18:04:16-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-hollywood/2015/12/06/macy-gray-want-christmas-no-trump-gun-control-free-healthcare/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Macy Gray has an updated version of \"All I Want for Christmas\" out for the holidays\u2014but her Christmas wish list may be too much for Santa.", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/12/macy-gray-performance-Getty.jpg", "title": "Singer Macy Gray Updates Holiday Classic: \u2018All I Want for Christmas\u2019 Is No Trump, Gun Control, Free Healthcare, Legal Pot", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "All I Want for Christmas, christmas, Climate Change, Donald Trump, gun control, Macy Gray, Marijuana, Obama, obamacare, social justice,2016 Presidential Race, Big Hollywood,Macy Gray", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2015-12-06T17:36:44-07:00", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "modified_time": "2015-12-06T18:04:16-07:00", "tag": "social justice", "categories": "Big Hollywood,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "\u201cAll I want for Christmas is a whole buncha stuff/But anything that you can buy me won\u2019t be enough,\u201d Gray sings.\nCheck out Macy Gray\u2019s version of \u201cAll I Want for Christmas\u201d above.\n\u201cNo matter what they say, Barack, you did real good/I hope that your successor does the things he or she should.\n\u201cYou might find Trump entertaining, and it\u2019s seductive when you can\u2019t wait to hear someone share their way-out-of-the-box ideas, but you\u2019ve got to work your way up.\n\u201cTake Mr. Gore more seriously/And do what you can to stop global warming,\u201d Gray adds."}
