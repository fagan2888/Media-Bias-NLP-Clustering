Although generally upbeat, he expressed frustration over the way signature policies such as the 2009 economic stimulus and the Affordable Care Act were received.\n\nWhile the unemployment rate has been cut in half and the once-moribund automotive and banking industries have been saved from the brink of oblivion during his tenure, many Americans remain unsatisfied with the economy, Obama said, a fact that has empowered the unorthodox campaigns of presidential candidates Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders.\n\n\u201cHow people feel about the economy,\u201d Obama told journalist Andrew Ross Sorkin, is based on \u201cwhat they hear.\u201d The message from many Republicans \u2014 and some Democrats \u2014 hasn\u2019t been rosy.\n\nPhoto: Mark Wilson/Getty Images\n\nIn contrast, the interview presented Obama with the opportunity to lay out what he believed were the main economic triumphs of his presidency, as well as some of his regrets. Below are five of his key points, charted.\n\nWavering Wages\n\nIt\u2019s true gross domestic product growth has been respectable in the years after the recession, while the headline unemployment rate has fallen below levels many economists once saw as a natural lower bound. Yet, as the current crop of presidential hopefuls are keen to point out, wages remain depressed for many Americans.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nObama conceded the point. \u201cWe could have brought down the unemployment rate lower, faster,\u201d he said. \u201cWe could have been lifting wages even faster than we did. And those things keep me up at night sometimes.\u201d\n\nIndeed, for the lowest-earning 60 percent of the population, real hourly wages either froze or fell between 2007 and 2015, although the past year has seen substantial gains. Still, overall wage growth remains well below the 20-year average of 3 percent.\n\nA Growing Government?\n\nRepublicans have assailed Obama as a typical big-government Democrat, bent on expanding Washington. Yet the pace of government spending under Obama has not been remarkable for its growth, but for its relative restraint.\n\nUnlike virtually all previous economic recoveries, the post-recession period saw the number of government employees contract rather than expand. Due in large part to budget-conscious state and municipal cutbacks \u2014 as well as the Republican-driven federal sequestration of 2013 \u2014 government employment has dipped as the rest of the job market has surged. Obama blames the trend for holding back economic growth during his presidency.\n\n\u201cThis is the first recovery where you actually saw the government workforce decline, and that created this massive fiscal drag throughout the recovery,\u201d Obama said.\n\nStunted Stimulus\n\nObama expressed dismay that he spent a huge chunk of his political capital on the Affordable Care Act, aka Obamacare, dooming chances that congressional Republicans would allow another stimulus after 2009. Economists such as Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen have cited the lack of government stimulus spending after 2009 for economic growth that has lagged behind its potential.\n\n\u201cOur failure in 2012, 2013, 2014, to initiate a massive infrastructure project \u2014 it was the perfect time to do it: low interest rates, construction industry is still on its heels, massive need \u2014 the fact that we failed to do that, for example, cost us time,\u201d Obama told the New York Times. \u201cIt meant that there were folks who we could have helped and put back to work and entire communities that could have prospered that ended up taking a lot longer to recovery.\u201d\n\nDeclining Deficits\n\nAs a recent Time magazine cover alarmingly suggested, some Americans are concerned with the size of the national debt, which has grown to almost $14 trillion. But that towering figure obscures the fact that federal government deficit, the annual shortfall between its expenditures and tax revenue, has fallen considerably.\n\nThe 2015 federal budget deficit of $439 billion compares unfavorably with the surpluses of the later years of Bill Clinton\u2019s administration. But, as a percentage of GDP, it is lower than any budget under Ronald Reagan.\n\n\u201cIf you ask the average person on the streets \u2014 \u2018Have deficits gone down or up under Obama?\u2019 \u2014 probably 70 percent would say they\u2019ve gone up,\u201d Obama said.\n\nObamacare\n\nThe Affordable Care Act constitutes Obama\u2019s most-contested policy, having faced more than 60 Republican votes to either amend or repeal it. Although opinion polls show Americans are split \u2014 and generally confused \u2014 about the merits of the law, Obama remains proud of it.\n\nBut Obamacare hasn\u2019t been able to arrest the growth in health costs and insurance premiums, which have moderated but continue to grow faster than most incomes. As Obama confessed, many Americans can\u2019t grasp the law\u2019s merits when prices are still climbing, even if the rate of growth is not as fast as during previous presidencies.\n\n\u201cIf your healthcare premiums go up by 6 percent, you\u2019re still irritated, even though the trend lines have been those premiums are going up 15 percent,\u201d Obama said.\n\nThat latter number may be slightly exaggerated, however: Kaiser Family Foundation data show average family premiums increasing at an average of 9 percent from 2000 to 2008.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://s2.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "obama nytimes interview, obama nyt mag interview, obama new york times interview, obama economy, obamacare, obama gdp, obama deficit, obama wages, obama wage growth, obama income, obama stimulus, wages, wage growth us economy", "og": {"site_name": "International Business Times", "description": "In an interview with the New York Times Magazine, the president outlines his thoughts on the economy.
