Translation: \u201cGifted Hands,\u201d a.k.a. Dr. Ben Carson, the famed neurosurgeon and conservative heartthrob, is running for president.\n\nCarter\u2019s proof was the picture of a billboard he took earlier this month in Baltimore. With a smiling Carson perched on the right, the sign reads \u201cAmerica needs strong medicine: Dr. Ben Carson for President in 2016.\u201d The nation very well might need strong medicine, but he is not the one to administer it.\n\nUpon further investigation, I discovered that the billboard is part of an old trend in presidential politics. That being people independent of the desired candidate forming committees whose raison d\u2019etre is to get said person to actually run for office. The folks behind \u201cReady for Hillary\u201d are doing everything they can to be, well, ready when (not \u201cif\u201d from their perspective) former secretary of state Hillary Clinton throws her hat in the ring for 2016. There is a \u201cReady for Warren\u201d group for those champing at the bit for Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) to rumble with Clinton for the Democratic Party presidential nomination. And the people behind the National Draft Ben Carson for President Committee are doing everything they can to entice Carson to make a go of it for the Republican nomination for president.\n\nThe \u201celectronic billboard advertisements have launched in Des Moines, Iowa and in the greater Baltimore area, where Dr. Ben Carson lives and works,\u201d announced John Philip Sousa IV, the chairman of the draft Carson effort, on the Web site last week. \u201cThe purpose of the billboards in Iowa is to encourage those attending January 21 mid-term caucuses to join the more than 200,000 Americans who have signed the petition urging Dr. Carson to run for President in 2016.\u201d\n\nThose hopeful souls have been encouraged by a couple of recent Carson interviews in which he has not ruled out a run. \u201cIf the circumstances were to evolve in such a way that [running for president] seemed to be what God was calling me to do, I would certainly do it,\u201d Carson said on the Sean Hannity Radio Show on Dec. 27. \u201cAnd I would never turn my back on my fellow citizens, if there was a hue and cry for such.\u201d I pray no such thing happens.\n\nCarson burst onto the scene again last year at the National Prayer Breakfast, where he smacked down Obamacare with President Obama listening two seats away. \u201cThe Johns Hopkins neurosurgeon may not be politically correct,\u201d the Wall Street Journal swooned, \u201cbut he\u2019s closer to correct than we\u2019ve heard in years.\u201d Carson is neither politically correct nor correct on a host of issues.\n\nLast April, Carson linked gays to pedophiles and \u201cpeople who believe in bestiality.\u201d His \u201cThat\u2019s not an orange. \u2026That\u2019s a banana\u2019 attempt to explain himself a few days later stretched the limits of ridiculousness. And what he said about Obamacare at the Values Voters Summit last October rendered him unworthy of high office. \u201cYou know, Obamacare is really, I think, the worst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery,\u201d Carson said.\n\nThe longed-for Republican told the Washington Times last month he has \u201cnot endorsed any of these organizations and have neither any professional nor personal relationships and am not in communication with any of them.\u201d The paper also reported that Carson \u201cdisavowed any plans \u2018as of today\u2019 for a political career.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs of never\u201d would be just fine.\n\nFollow Jonathan on Twitter: @Capehartj", "article_metadata": {"description": "The nation very well might need strong medicine, but the famed neurosurgeon and conservative heartthrob is not the one to administer it.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/capehart", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The nation very well might need strong medicine, but the famed neurosurgeon and conservative heartthrob is not the one to administer it.", "title": "Ready for Ben Carson?
