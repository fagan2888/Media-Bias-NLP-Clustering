BeneStream is a health technology company that connects qualified employees to government health benefits through its signature product,Medicaid Migration\u2122. The process helps workers access affordable, quality health coverage and other benefits. The company raised a total of $2 million from BlueCross BlueShield Venture Partners and Sandbox Advantage Fund, bringing the total Series A round to $6.26 million.\n\n\u201cThis investment by BlueCross BlueShield Venture Partners and Sandbox Advantage Fund demonstrates that health insurance companies understand the importance of Medicaid enrollment as a strategy for managing the overall cost of health insurance for businesses while increasing employee access to health benefits,\u201d said Ben Geyerhahn, CEO and Co-Founder. \u201cWe look forward to working with the Blue Cross Blue Shield Venture Partners and its limited partners to support our efforts to seek distribution at national scale.\u201d\n\nBeneStream\u2019s process informs employees if they qualify for government sponsored health insurance and is proven to deliver cost savings as a component of a health insurance package for qualified companies. The process utilizes the Medicaid expansion portion of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) which makes access to healthcare coverage more affordable for many employees and their families who weren\u2019t previously eligible.\n\n\u201cI am excited to join BeneStream\u2019s board as the team is addressing a key piece of the benefits puzzle. The company is emerging as a market leader at informing employees of the benefits to which they are qualified. BeneStream is also well positioned to capitalize on opportunities that emerge from further expansion of Medicaid and the proliferation of Managed Medicaid,\u201d said Anna Haghgooie, Managing Director of Sandbox Industries, who will represent BlueCross BlueShield Venture Partners on the Board.\n\nThe round was lead by Michael Sachs, who is now Chairman of BeneStream\u2019s Board, and his firm TLSG Investments, LLC.
