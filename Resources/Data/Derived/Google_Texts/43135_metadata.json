That\u2019s bad news for one of the major parties, and it isn\u2019t Webb\u2019s.\n\nIn Democratic circles, the news barely merits a raised eyebrow. Webb is polling in the low single digits in the primary race, and has, so far, mounted a fairly subdued campaign. In a primary battle where fundraising totals are well into the tens of millions for the frontrunners, Webb hasn\u2019t raised even $1 million.\n\nRelated: Here\u2019s Why Biden Should Stay Out of the Race\n\nFor Republicans, though, the prospect of Webb in the race this time next year will cause some heartburn.\n\nWebb, who is expected to discuss a possible independent run in a speech at the National Press Club in Washington on Tuesday morning, was never an obvious fit in the Democratic Party. A former Marine infantry officer decorated for valor in Vietnam, he served as an assistant secretary of Defense and then as secretary of the Navy under President Ronald Reagan. He is a vocal advocate of a strong national defense in general, and a powerful U.S. military in particular.\n\nWebb has taken stands on issues such as affirmative action, gun rights and women in the military that seem to place him more in line with conservative values than with the liberal mainstream of the Democratic Party.\n\nWere Webb to go through with it and run as an Independent, the impact on the Democratic Party\u2019s eventual nominee would likely be trivial. For many voters unfamiliar with Webb, their introduction to him was likely the Democratic presidential debate held last week in Las Vegas. Webb\u2019s most memorable contribution to the event was frequent complaints about not being given enough time to talk. He wasn\u2019t wrong \u2014Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders were given much more time than any of the other candidates \u2014 but he came across as petulant in the eyes of many viewers.\n\nRelated: It\u2019s Not Just the Rich Who Would Be Hit by Sanders\u2019 Tax Hikes\n\nWebb\u2019s performance in the debate was parodied over the weekend on \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d Alec Baldwin, in character as Webb, frequently complained about not being given enough time to talk. But when he was questioned about some of his more controversial positions he would look flummoxed for a moment before declaring, \u201cPass.\u201d\n\nDepending on how the Republican primary plays out, though, Webb could be a real problem for the GOP.\n\nRelated: Donald Trump \u2013 I Would Have Prevented 9/11 Attacks\n\nGiven the demographic realities of the U.S. electoral map, there just isn\u2019t a lot of room for error for any Republican candidate looking to win the presidency. If Donald Trump continues to lead the pack, a lot of conflicted Republican voters will be looking for a reason not to cast their ballots for a former reality television star who, many of them believe, is not worthy of their vote.\n\nIt\u2019s likely that a vanishingly small portion of those voters would cast a ballot for a candidate like Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders. But a Jim Webb candidacy might offer an acceptable alternative for conservatives unwilling to support Trump.\n\nWould Webb peel off a large segment of conservative voters? Probably not. But to create serious problems for the GOP, he wouldn\u2019t have to. Most analyses of the electoral map for 2016 give the Democrats a substantial advantage. The University of Virginia\u2019s Center for Politics, for example, says the Democrats have something on the order of 247 electoral votes \u2014 out of the 270 needed \u2014 in fairly safe states. Republicans, by contrast, have only about 206.\n\nThat leaves 85 votes in swing states, and Democrats only need 33 of them. In a toss-up state like Virginia, where Webb won a Senate seat in a statewide election and which has a large proportion of retired military voters, it\u2019s not hard to see him pull enough votes away from Trump, or many other GOP candidates, to throw the state\u2019s crucial 13 votes to the Democrats.\n\nSo ironically, when Webb floats the idea of an independent run, it probably won\u2019t be the members of his own party sweating, but rather the folks at the Republican National Committee.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Jim Webb might run for president as an independent.
