President Obama is no stranger on the talk show circuit. In 2009, a few months after his inauguration, he made history by becoming the first sitting president to ever appear on a late night talk show as a guest on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno.

In anticipation of his final appearance tonight on Jon Stewart’s The Daily Show (his seventh!), we looked back and chose our favorite moments from President Obama’s late night stints.
