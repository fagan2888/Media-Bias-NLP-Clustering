Here are the 5 reasons to be glad that you watched the NBC Democratic debate.\n\nVideo:\n\n1). The Democrats Immediately Mix It Up On Guns\n\nBernie Sanders was asked about his change in position to supporting immunity for the gun manufacturers. Sanders did a bit of a dodge as he defended his record on gun control and listed his (D-) rating with the NRA. Clinton responded by pointing to Sanders\u2019 record of voting against the Brady Bill five times. Martin O\u2019Malley had the best line when he said that he never met a self-respecting hunter who needed AR-15 to take down a deer.\n\nThe Sanders campaign responded by emailing reporters, this quote from when Hillary Clinton attacked President Obama during the 2008 campaign, \u201cI disagree with Sen. Obama\u2019s assertion that people in our country cling to guns and have certain attitudes about trade and immigration simply out of frustration. . . .\n\nYou know, my dad took me out behind the cottage that my grandfather built on a little lake called Lake Winola outside of Scranton and taught me how to shoot when I was a little girl. . . .\n\nYou know, some people now continue to teach their children and their grandchildren. It\u2019s part of culture. It\u2019s part of a way of life. People enjoy hunting and shooting because it\u2019s an important part of who they are. Not because they are bitter.\u201d\n\nThe Clinton campaign responded with a bullet point list of the Sanders record on gun control:\n\nSanders voted not once but five times against the Brady Bill.\n\n\u00b7 Sanders voted twice for what the head of the NRA called the most significant piece of pro-gun legislation in the last 20 years: giving gun manufacturers sweeping immunity for their actions.\n\n\u00b7 Sanders voted for an amendment to create the so-called \u201cCharleston Loophole,\u201d which allowed the Charleston shooter to get a gun before his background check was completed.\n\n\u00b7 Sanders voted to make it harder to crack down on gun dealers who break the law.\n\n\u00b7 Sanders voted to overturn a ban on guns on Amtrak trains.\n\n\u00b7 The NRA helped elect Bernie Sanders to the House in 1990.\n\nThe facts are that Clinton and Sanders have inconsistencies in their record on gun control.\n\n2). Sanders and Clinton Have A Bitter Debate About Healthcare\n\nFormer Sec. of State Clinton\u2019s argument is that the country should not tear up the Affordable Care Act and start over again with a new debate that would set the country back. Bernie Sanders argued that his Medicare for all plan would cover the 29 million people who still don\u2019t have healthcare.\n\nSanders said what this debate is really about is whether \u201cwe have the guts to stand up to the health insurance industry and the pharmaceutical companies. Clinton pointed out that during the ACA debate Democrats could not get support for the public option. Clinton clearly has been shaped by her experience in the 1990s of trying to pass healthcare reform. The debate within the Democratic Party comes down to whether Democrats should stay on ACA path or take a shot at Medicare for all.\n\n3). Clinton And Sanders Say No To Ground Forces To Combat ISIS\n\nWhen Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders were asked if they saw any scenario where ground forces could be used to combat ISIS. Former Sec. Clinton said, \u201cabsolutely not.\u201d Sanders blasted Republicans for not learning the lessons of Iraq, and he said that using ground forces to combat ISIS would lead to perpetual war and be a complete disaster. Sanders said that ISIS won\u2019t be destroyed with American troops in perpetual warfare. Martin O\u2019Malley said that he believed that President Obama was doing the right thing. O\u2019Malley said that he appreciates that Democrats don\u2019t use the term boot on the ground.\n\n4). Hillary Clinton Rips Rick Snyder Over Contaminated Water In Michigan\n\nWhen the candidates were offered a platform to talk about whatever they wanted, Hillary Clinton chose to talk about the scandal of the lead contaminated water in Flint, Michigan. Clinton said that a majority African-American population was drinking and bathing in lead-contaminated water, and the Republican governor acted like he did not care. Clinton was certain that the governor would have cared it was white kids in a Detroit suburb who were being poisoned with contaminated water.\n\nBernie Sanders called on Gov. Snyder to resign yesterday, but Hillary Clinton beat him to the punch at the debate.\n\n\n\n5). Democrats Show Why Republicans Are Unfit To Govern\n\nThe Republican debates have all lacked what the Democratic debates have. The Democratic candidates disagree on how to get there, but they all agree on the big goals. Democrats have a real vision for the country. There isn\u2019t a battle for the direction of the party happening on the Democratic side.\n\nAny of three Democratic candidates would make a better president than any of the dozen Republicans running for the White House. Democrats demonstrated their competence and ability to govern during the NBC debate. Clinton, Sanders, and O\u2019Malley have the policies that are missing on the Republican side. While Republicans fight the culture wars and rage against the nation\u2019s changing demographics, Democrats are speaking to the real problems of ordinary Americans.\n\nViewers should be glad that they watched this debate. It should give them the motivation to elect the party\u2019s nominee, no matter who that person is.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Democrats delivered an amazing debate that was everything the Republican Party can never be.
