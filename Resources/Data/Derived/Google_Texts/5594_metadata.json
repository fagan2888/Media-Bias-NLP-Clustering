Their push to repeal Mr. Obama\u2019s health care law was going nowhere, and they desperately needed a new plan.\n\nOut of that session, held one morning in a location the members insist on keeping secret, came a little-noticed \u201cblueprint to defunding Obamacare,\u201d signed by Mr. Meese and leaders of more than three dozen conservative groups.\n\nIt articulated a take-no-prisoners legislative strategy that had long percolated in conservative circles: that Republicans could derail the health care overhaul if conservative lawmakers were willing to push fellow Republicans \u2014 including their cautious leaders \u2014 into cutting off financing for the entire federal government.\n\nSo, when you are told by Republicans that the shutdown is he fault of President Obama and Democrats, you can now say with certainty that this is untrue.\n\nA defunding \u201ctool kit\u201d created in early September included talking points for the question, \u201cWhat happens when you shut down the government and you are blamed for it?\u201d The suggested answer was the one House Republicans give today: \u201cWe are simply calling to fund the entire government except for the Affordable Care Act/Obamacare.\u201d\n\nThe current budget brinkmanship is just the latest development in a well-financed, broad-based assault on the health law, Mr. Obama\u2019s signature legislative initiative. Groups like Tea Party Patriots, Americans for Prosperity and FreedomWorks are all immersed in the fight, as is Club for Growth, a business-backed nonprofit organization. Some, like Generation Opportunity and Young Americans for Liberty, both aimed at young adults, are upstarts. Heritage Action is new, too, founded in 2010 to advance the policy prescriptions of its sister group, the Heritage Foundation.\n\nThe billionaire Koch brothers, Charles and David, have been deeply involved with financing the overall effort. A group linked to the Kochs, Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce, disbursed more than $200 million last year to nonprofit organizations involved in the fight. Included was $5 million to Generation Opportunity, which created a buzz last month with an Internet advertisement showing a menacing Uncle Sam figure popping up between a woman\u2019s legs during a gynecological exam.\n\nSubscribe to my premium podcast and get exclusive access to the listener club.", "article_metadata": {"prism.channel": "fnc", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "og": {"site_name": "FOX News Radio", "description": "from alan.com\r\n\r\nThe plan to hold funding of the government hostage was plan months in the making, planned by former Reagan Attorney General Ed Meese and the billionaire Koch Brothers, the New York Times reports.\nShortly after President Obama started his second term, a loose-knit coalition of conser", "title": "Government Shutdown Was Planned For Months By Ed Meese, Koch Bros", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://i2.wp.com/www.alan.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/koch-brothers-2_thumb.png?resize=300%2C271", "updated_time": "2013-10-06T20:45:30+00:00", "url": "http://radio.foxnews.com/2013/10/06/government-shutdown-was-planned-for-months-by-ed-meese-koch-bros/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://radio.foxnews.com/2013/10/06/government-shutdown-was-planned-for-months-by-ed-meese-koch-bros/", "image": "http://i2.wp.com/www.alan.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/koch-brothers-2_thumb.png?resize=300%2C271", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Government Shutdown Was Planned For Months By Ed Meese, Koch Bros"}, "prism.section": "radio", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=601935043", "fb": {"app_id": 108927045863499}, "article": {"section": "Alan Colmes", "published_time": "2013-10-06T20:45:30+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-10-06T20:45:30+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "from alan.com\r\n\r\nThe plan to hold funding of the government hostage was plan months in the making, planned by former Reagan Attorney General Ed Meese and the billionaire Koch Brothers, the New York Times reports.\nShortly after President Obama started his second term, a loose-knit coalition of conser"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc649\"", "article_summary": "Their push to repeal Mr. Obama\u2019s health care law was going nowhere, and they desperately needed a new plan.\nfrom alan.comThe plan to hold funding of the government hostage was plan months in the making, planned by former Reagan Attorney General Ed Meese and the billionaire Koch Brothers, the New York Times reports.\nOut of that session, held one morning in a location the members insist on keeping secret, came a little-noticed \u201cblueprint to defunding Obamacare,\u201d signed by Mr. Meese and leaders of more than three dozen conservative groups.\nShortly after President Obama started his second term, a loose-knit coalition of conservative activists led by former Attorney General Edwin Meese III gathered in the capital to plot strategy.\nThe billionaire Koch brothers, Charles and David, have been deeply involved with financing the overall effort."}
