(AP) \u2014 Hard-packed roads that were identified for removal in 2007 are now being churned up and restored to a natural state across Lewis and Clark National Forest, with the aim being improved vegetation growth and water flow.\n\nObliterating the roads involves overturning soils and re-contouring road cuts.\n\nMuch of the current work is occurring in the Little Belt Mountains.\n\nCarol Hatfield, district ranger for the forest\u2019s Belt Creek and White Sulphur districts, said she\u2019s received 20 to 30 calls and visits from people wondering why roads the roads are being removed.\n\nSome of those roads lead to favorite hunting spots.\n\n\u201cThey were upset, really upset, and they don\u2019t understand what the heck we\u2019re doing out there,\u201d Hatfield said.\n\nThe Forest Service is taking the public feedback seriously, and making some changes in the road removal work to accommodate access, Hatfield said.\n\nThere are important reasons for the work, she said.\n\nThe roads being removed are, in fact, not officially part of the road system, and the new travel plan OK\u2019d in 2007 identified them for decommissioning, Hatfield said. That work is occurring a little at a time each year, she said.\n\nMost of the roads being obliterated are short stretches of former logging roads. Others roads in line for removal were created by users over time and are not part of the official road system.\n\nHatfield added that the work is part of broader, national efforts by the Forest Service to improve watersheds and restore areas where old roads and trails are causing sediment pollution and interfering with the natural hydrology of the forest.\n\nThe compacted roads don\u2019t allow run-off from snowmelt to naturally filtrate into the ground to recharge groundwater, and also increases run-off and sediment into streams, said Stan VanSickle, a civil engineering technician with the forest.\n\nWork to remove them began in 2008 and has continued each year since. Hatfield believes she might be hearing more about the work because some of the roads being removed now are used to access popular hunting areas.\n\nHatfield says she understands the frustration.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so fresh right now,\u201d Hatfield said of the road obliterations. \u201cIt\u2019s a big deal.\u201d\n\nThe work involves using a backhoe to scarify, or break up, roads that have been compacted over time. A full obliteration also involves recontouring the landscape to its natural slope.\n\nOn Wednesday, Shane Tew of BSE Excavating of Townsend was using a backhoe to break up a compacted 6/10ths of mile of trail off of Lamb Creek 76 miles southeast of Great Falls, leaving a trail of overturned dirt.\n\nAs the scoop bit down through the hard ground, meeting rocks and roots, it made a crunching noise.\n\n\u201cThe reason why the road is being removed is that it is no longer part of our system, nor do we have the money to maintain all of the roads that we consider non-system roads anymore,\u201d Hatfield said.\n\n\u201cTherefore, we\u2019re removing it from the system,\u201d she added. \u201cMost of the roads that are being removed are compacted, and therefore not allowing any snowmelt or water run-out during the spring to filter through the soil and allow for vegetation to grow back onto the road prism.\u201d\n\nIn 2007, Lewis and Clark National Forest OK\u2019d a new travel plan.\n\nIn that plan, certain roads were decommissioned, meaning they no longer were needed by the Forest Service.\n\nMost of the roads were once used to access timber units for logging.\n\n\u201cWe just don\u2019t log like we used to,\u201d Hatfield said.\n\nIt\u2019s these roads, officially designated as \u201cnon-system\u201d roads in the 2007 travel plan, that are now are being removed.\n\nVanSickle, the civil engineering technician, said there\u2019s 900 to 1,200 miles of non-system roads alone in the Jefferson Division of Lewis and Clark National Forest, which includes island mountain ranges to the south and east of Great Falls.\n\nMany are short, old roads that were made solely for the purpose of hauling logs out from a timber unit, said Dave Cunningham, a spokesman for the forest.\n\nThe Forest Service is targeting 40 miles of road for removal or restoration each year for the next three years.\n\nIn 2014, about $230,000 was allocated for the removal of 55 miles of roads in three locations in the Little Belt Mountains, one in the Dry Fork of Belt Creek area and two near Lamb Creek, a tributary of Sheep Creek.\n\n\u201cIt is basically restoring our ecosystem - not to 100 percent of the way it was - but at least to where we can get vegetation growing back onto the hillside where roads were put in and they left a compacted road prism,\u201d Hatfield said.\n\nThe purpose of removing the roads is to reconnect the natural hydrology of the forest, VanSickle said.\n\nIn the forest, snow melts and becomes water, VanSickle said. It\u2019s used for drinking, crops and livestock and fisheries.\n\nHistorically, prior to roads being constructed, the water would infiltrate the ground and slowly percolate over time through the watershed.\n\n\u201cAnd as water becomes a more and more limited resource, the more of that that can go into the ground, the better for future use, rather than having it run off and end up in the ocean in one growing season, we can now use that like a bank,\u201d VanSickle said. \u201cOver time, we\u2019ll have that water available.\u201d\n\nWhen the \u201chard pan\u201d of the compacted roads is removed, the ground acts more like a sponge with the water following a slow, natural hydrological path to streams and ground water, he said.\n\nThe Forest Service nationally has the largest infrastructure of roads in the nation, he said, but it\u2019s not being maintained to standard.\n\nThis year in Lewis and Clark National Forest, 5 percent of the roads were graded, he said. Ideally, 50 percent should be graded.\n\nMoney that\u2019s used to remove the old roads is a special allocation and cannot be used for regular road maintenance, Hatfield said.\n\nFull obliteration work involves digging up compacted roads 2 feet deep and overturning the dirt. The road cut is then re-contoured to the natural slope of the landscape. And slash or small trees and limbs are placed on top of it.\n\nAn old \u201cjammer\u201d logging road off Lamb Creek Road, for example, was fully restored in October. It leads up a steep incline. On Wednesday, the smell of freshly turned dirt was in the air, and the ground looked like a freshly tilled garden. Slash was scattered on top. The ground was spongy.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t an easy uphill walk.\n\nIn response to complaints from recreationists, the Forest Service has reduced the amount of slash placed on top of the overturned soil, Hatfield said. The slash is meant to reduce runoff and erosion.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re learning as we go,\u201d Hatfield said. \u201cThe other part, we\u2019re trying to take into consideration the public\u2019s feedback.\u201d\n\nThe Forest Service also has come up with a modified treatment in response to complaints from the public. Instead of full obliteration, a small path is being left behind on some of the obliterated roads that people can walk on or use a game cart. A place at the mouth of the roads also is being left where vehicles can be parked.\n\nIn the case of some snowmobile routes, the roads are being scarified, but not re-contoured, so snowmobile travel can continue. That was the case Wednesday at the road where BSE Excavating of Townsend was working.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just trying to find that middle ground between motorized users and restoration,\u201d VanSickle said.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Great Falls Tribune, http://www.greatfallstribune.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hard-packed roads that were identified for removal in 2007 are now being churned up and restored to a natural state across Lewis and Clark National Forest, with the aim being improved vegetation growth and water flow.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/oct/26/forest-service-churns-up-old-logging-roads/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "Hard-packed roads that were identified for removal in 2007 are now being churned up and restored to a natural state across Lewis and Clark National Forest, with the aim being improved vegetation growth and water flow.", "title": "Forest Service churns up old logging roads"}, "twitter": {"description": "Hard-packed roads that were identified for removal in 2007 are now being churned up and restored to a natural state across Lewis and Clark National Forest, with the aim being improved vegetation growt", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Forest Service churns up old logging roads"}, "Author": "Karl Puckett", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Environment, Carol Hatfield, Forest Service, Stan Vansickle, Great Falls"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd496\"", "article_summary": "The Forest Service nationally has the largest infrastructure of roads in the nation, he said, but it\u2019s not being maintained to standard.\nIn that plan, certain roads were decommissioned, meaning they no longer were needed by the Forest Service.\nThe Forest Service is targeting 40 miles of road for removal or restoration each year for the next three years.\n\u201cThe other part, we\u2019re trying to take into consideration the public\u2019s feedback.\u201dThe Forest Service also has come up with a modified treatment in response to complaints from the public.\nThe Forest Service is taking the public feedback seriously, and making some changes in the road removal work to accommodate access, Hatfield said."}
