Is government bureaucracy too large and unwieldy to be effective? S.E. Cupp explains.



FULL TRANSCRIPT

S.E. Cupp: The IRS, the NSA, DOJ, it’s just, are there any initials left for the government to defend?

Where exactly is big government bureaucracy actually working? In the past five years we’ve seen tremendous failures at the ATF, the Department of Energy, the IRS, the NSA, the DOJ, Health and Human Services, the State Department, and now the VA.

Democrats will tell us that the system works, and it’s just low level bureaucrats or rogue contractors that are the problem.

Well yeah isn’t that exactly the point? That when the system is so big, so unwieldy, so out of control, it’s impossible to manage all of those elements, and something’s going to fall through the cracks.

And now it’s not just costing American taxpayers, it’s costing American lives.

So if Republicans are smart, they’ll make Democrats in 2014 and 2016 answer not only to individual scandals, but to the larger question of “Where is your big government bureaucracy actually servicing the American people?” And I think Democrats are going to have a very tough time defending against that.
