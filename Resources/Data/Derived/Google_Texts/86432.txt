The Christmas season is a whirlwind of shopping, eating and celebrating with friends and family.

And, of course, honoring holiday traditions. For many families, searching for -- and cutting down -- the perfect tree is the first ritual that kicks off the season.

Cut-your-own-tree farms around the suburbs don't just offer the tree, but also perks like visits with Santa, wagon rides and hot chocolate. Owners are hoping families will create a festive memory together -- minus the tree drama found in movie classics like "A Christmas Story" and "Deck the Halls."

So gather up the kids, the gear -- even the dog! -- and head out to your local farm.
