TOWN OF JOHNSTOWN, Wis. (AP) - Authorities say a Janesville man has been fatally shot by a member of his turkey-hunting party in an apparent accident.

A statement from the Rock County sheriff’s office says officials responded Sunday morning to a report of a man with a gunshot wound in a field in the Town of Johnstown.

The statement says deputies found the victim, a 37-year-old who had been turkey hunting with family members. Life-saving efforts were unsuccessful, and he was pronounced dead at the scene.

An initial investigation shows the man was trying to retrieve a wounded turkey when he inadvertently ran into the field of fire of another member of his hunting party. He was shot in the back.

The sheriff’s office says the incident appears to be “an unfortunate hunting accident.”

An autopsy will be performed Monday.
