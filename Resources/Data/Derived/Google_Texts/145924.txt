A capsule — and different — look at elected and public officials

in Texas.

Randall County Director of Human Resources and Payroll Warren Pitt

■ The basics: 47 years old. Married, four children and two grandchildren. Canyon native. Two degrees from West Texas A&M. Has been in current position with the county for five years. Has been with the county 11 years.

■ Basic job description/responsibilities: “We handle the payroll for all county employees, and we handle all county employee benefits, as well — health insurance, vision, dental, etc.”

■ How many employees are we talking? “From 450 to 475 depending on the day.”

■ Favorite/least favorite parts of the job: “My least favorite part is all the rules and regulations regarding payroll and benefits — especially Obamacare or the Affordable Care Act. It makes it more difficult to provide a lot of things. The best part of my position is the people — helping people on a constant basis is very rewarding.”

■ Hobbies/spare time: “I’m an avid baseball fan. I have season tickets to the Texas Rangers, but I don’t get to go see every game, obviously. I go down there as much as I can. I also coach my son’s baseball team. I love being out there with those guys and teaching the game of baseball.”

■ Guilty pleasure: “Diet Dr. Pepper (laughing.). I’m a Diet Dr. Pepper-aholic.”
