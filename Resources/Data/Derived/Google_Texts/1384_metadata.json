He led the turnaround of the Phoenix House New York Region as a consultant prior to becoming CEO.\n\nMeitiner says lately he has been working toward finding strategic partners for the not-for-profit Phoenix House. With programs in nine states and the District of Columbia, the organization\u2019s aim now is to stay on pace to grow the $150 million business through mergers and acquisitions.\n\n\u201cThe journey we\u2019ve been on these past eight years has been the professionalizing of the organization in an era when there\u2019s much more complexity,\u201d Meitiner tells Behavioral Healthcare. \u201cOne big accomplishment has been moving us into a new era of technology, not just in adopting EHR systems, but also in terms of social media and other technology.\u201d\n\nHe says, for example, social media has transformed the organization\u2019s outreach to potential clients who need services. For the first time, there\u2019s a direct link that can engage consumers where they\u2019re at. He dedicated an entire team to the digital channels. Under his watch, Phoenix House also redesigned its website\u2014more than once\u2014to optimize it for site visitors as the digital technology changed over the years.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important in search engine optimization so people can find us online to find services,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s had huge impact.\u201d\n\nFuture moves\n\nUp next for Meitiner is the possibility of consulting with organizations that focus on humanitarian efforts, he says. With more than 35 years of global business and retail experience, he wants to do work that would help people in some way, although he doesn\u2019t have a specific position pinned down just yet.\n\nHe says the next president and CEO of Phoenix House will face industry challenges but also will have an opportunity to continue the organization\u2019s evolution from its origins in substance-use disorders to a larger provider of whole-health services. Meitiner says right now two-thirds of Phoenix House clients have co-occurring mental health issues, and the clinical teams are also treating clients\u2019 heart disease, hepatitis and other chronic diseases.\n\n\u201cPhoenix House needs an outstanding leader with executive experience in healthcare who could help develop or run an integrated healthcare system,\u201d he says. \u201cWe need to evolve into more of a behavioral health organization with integration into mental health and medical care.\u201d\n\nThe organization and its 1,800 employees provided 170,000 outpatient visits and 1.3 million residential treatment days in 2013.\n\nChanging face of treatment\n\nBig picture healthcare trends also drove changes to Phoenix House\u2019s strategy during Meitiner\u2019s tenure.\n\n\u201cThe Affordable Care Act has heralded an era of managed care,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019re having to make sure you can justify the need for the services you are providing through a third party entity that wants to make sure the services are necessary for their clients. There is more oversight, and as a consequence, there is improvement in the quality of care that comes from that.\u201d\n\nFor example, he says, a treatment program in the past might have been delivered over 12 months, but today, the limitations of managed care might whittle the timeframe down to 30 days. Therefore, the content delivered in 30 days must be more intense, which changes the therapeutic approach.\n\n\u201cIf you have 30 days, make sure that every day clients get great stuff delivered to them in their ongoing recovery,\u201d Meitiner says.\n\nHuman resources\n\nBut for the industry at large, Meitiner says, recruiting and retaining a solid work force will be the critical challenge. Especially now that Medicaid rolls are expanding and expectations of payers are higher than ever, there is an increasing premium on counselors, clinicians and program directors who can deliver effective, quality care.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to pay competitively to attract those people,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can\u2019t expect people who have to work in very stressful situations to do so at low wages. Medicaid rates and contract rates need to be able to allow providers to attract the type and quality of people you would want treating your own loved ones.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"com.silverpop.cothost": "engage4.silverpop.com", "com.silverpop.brandeddomains": "www.pages04.net,assistedhousingfinancialinsider.com,assistedhousinginsider.com,commercialleaselawinsider.com,constructionsuperconference.com,efaconference.com,secure.rhq.com,secure2.rhq.com,www.addictionpro.com,www.apartmentlawinsider.com,www.assistedhousinginsider.com,www.behavioral.net,www.commercialleaselawinsider.com,www.commercialtenantsleaseinsider.com,www.communityassociationinsider.com,www.constructionsuperconference.com,www.entjournal.com,www.environmentsforaging.com,www.etouches.com,www.fairhousingcoach.com,www.hcd11.com,www.healthcare-informatics.com,www.healthcarebuildingideas.com,www.healthcaredesignmagazine.com,www.herdjournal.com,www.ihealthtran.com,www.landlordvtenant.com,www.ltlmagazine.com,www.nycapartmentlaw.com,www.taxcredithousinginsider.com,www.vendomegrp.com,www.vendomerealestatemedia.com", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "After eight years of leading Phoenix House, president and CEO Howard Meitiner announced that he is turning in his keys.\nHe led the turnaround of the Phoenix House New York Region as a consultant prior to becoming CEO.\nMeitiner says lately he has been working toward finding strategic partners for the not-for-profit Phoenix House.\nUnder his watch, Phoenix House also redesigned its website\u2014more than once\u2014to optimize it for site visitors as the digital technology changed over the years.\nMeitiner says right now two-thirds of Phoenix House clients have co-occurring mental health issues, and the clinical teams are also treating clients\u2019 heart disease, hepatitis and other chronic diseases."}
