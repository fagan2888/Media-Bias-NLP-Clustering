Americans Can Now Shop for and Enroll in ACA-Compliant Health Plans on GetInsured.com

PALO ALTO, CA--(Marketwired - Feb 19, 2014) - GetInsured, a leading health insurance technology company, today announced an integration with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) that gives Americans an online alternative to Healthcare.gov for enrolling in subsidized health insurance. GetInsured's solution is a milestone in the implementation of the Affordable Care Act -- the first time a private marketplace is enabling customers to shop for and compare health plans, claim their tax credits and complete enrollment without ever picking up the phone.

"It took me less than 10 minutes to enroll in a health plan on GetInsured.com. I qualified for a tax credit and found a great plan that's affordable. I'm so happy that signing up online wasn't the nightmare I'd heard it was going to be... it was really easy," said Leah Beth, a 34-year-old GetInsured customer in Texas.

GetInsured.com makes it easy and stress-free for consumers to find the right health plan at the right price with user-friendly tools, including:

The GetInsured Tax Credit Estimator helps customers estimate their eligibility for government assistance in purchasing insurance coverage. Consumers simply enter their age, ZIP code and estimated income, and instantly see the estimated subsidy amount to which they're entitled.

The GetInsured Plan Score (GPS) helps customers easily compare health plans based on the options that are important to them, including monthly premium amount, estimated out-of-pocket expenses, and health services such as chiropractic and dental care. The GPS calculates a score between 1 and 100; the higher the number, the closer the plan comes to what the consumer is looking for.

"We're grateful to our colleagues at Healthcare.gov for working diligently with us over the past few months to enable this technology breakthrough -- the GetInsured online solution is great news for Americans who still need to enroll in health insurance and don't want to spend a lot of time doing it," said Chini Krishnan, GetInsured co-founder and CEO. "Thanks to our health insurance carrier partners, who have worked with us to increase the inventory of the GetInsured.com marketplace, consumers have a wide variety of health plans to choose from in all of the major markets served by Healthcare.gov, including Texas, Florida, Illinois, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia, Arizona, North Carolina, Missouri, Utah and Idaho."

Expert Help for Those Who Need It

Americans who need help choosing a health plan can talk with a GetInsured licensed insurance broker who will offer unbiased, personalized advice and can complete enrollment for customers over the phone within minutes, for no charge. GetInsured also offers a solution that lets its brokers "screen-share" or "co-browse" with consumers so they can walk through the enrollment process together, step by step.

For those who don't have access to a computer or the Internet, GetInsured's brokers can complete the entire enrollment process for customers by phone. According to Pew Research Center, 15 percent of American adults ages 18 and older do not use the internet or email.

"We know that Americans are still learning about the Affordable Care Act and many welcome the guiding hand of a licensed broker, which is why we also offer our customers excellent phone-based enrollment options -- no computer or Internet access required," said Krishnan.
