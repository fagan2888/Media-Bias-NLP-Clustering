And so it seems whenever Pope Francis discusses drug policy that his distinctly South American point-of-view is most evident. On Friday the Boston Globe reported the pontiff once again condemned the legalization of marijuana and other recreational drugs, based in part on a clearly intimate knowledge of the chaos wrought by drug cartels and the problems of addiction. \"The scourge of drug-trafficking that favors violence and sows the seeds of suffering and death requires of society as a whole an act of courage,\" Francis told delegates to a drug-enforcement conference in Rome.\n\nBorn Jorge Mario Bergoglio in 1936, Francis is the first of five children born to Italian immigrant parents living in a barrio within Buenos Aires. Before joining the Jesuits, he worked as a bar bouncer, as a janitor, and as an employee in a chemical laboratory. When he was 33, he became an ordained priest and from there ascended within the ranks of the Catholic Church, named first a Bishop, then a Cardinal, and now Pope. In emulation of Saint Francis of Assisi, he chose his papal name.\n\nThe media generally emphasizes his Franciscan simplicity, popularizing, for instance, his choice to reside in a guesthouse rather than the formal papal apartments of the Apostolic Palace and to ride on the bus instead of in the \u2018pope mobile.\u2019 His garments are less grand and ornamental than those of his predecessors; he prefers simple white vestments, familiar wire-rimmed glasses, and the same crucifix from his days of service in Argentina. This humble appearance is not a hollow act by most accounts. Francis\u2019 actions also reveal a sense of humility, as when he washed the feet of 12 disabled people during Easter Mass.\n\nHowever, Francis has maintained a concurrent and unwavering conservative philosophy in matters of the church. He has upheld Catholic doctrine on contraception, abortion, and homosexuality, while adopting a zero-tolerance policy against sex abuse in the Church. He also demonstrates his traditionalist values when speaking of drug policy.\n\n\"A reduction in the spread and influence of drug addiction will not be achieved by a liberalization of drug use, as is currently being proposed in various parts of Latin America,\" Francis said while addressing the Roman conference on Friday. In particular, he referred to legislative acts legalizing recreational drugs as \u201chighly questionable,\u201d as reported by The Guardian, because they \u201cfail to produce the desired effects.\u2019\u2019 The pontiff also noted providing addicts with drugs doesn\u2019t solve the problem and is \u2018\u2018rather a veiled means of surrendering to the phenomenon.\u201d\n\nAs archbishop of Buenos Aires, Francis devoted a significant amount of his time and work to drug addicts and perhaps for this reason he speaks so passionately of the necessity \"... to confront the problems underlying the use of these drugs by promoting greater justice, educating young people in the values that build up life in society, accompanying those in difficulty and giving them hope for the future.\" Forcefully, he concluded, \u2018\u2018the problem of drug use is not solved with drugs!\u2019\u2019", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "pope francis, catholic church, recreational drugs, legalization of marijuana, drug addiction", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Pope Francis once again condemned the legalization of marijuana and other recreational drugs when speaking to a drug-enforcement conference in Rome.", "title": "Pope Francis, True To South American Roots, Condemns \u2018Scourge Of Drug Trafficking\u2019", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pope-francis-stands-against-legalization-marijuana-and-other-recreational-drugs-289132", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/20/pope-francis.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Pope Francis once again condemned the legalization of marijuana and other recreational drugs when speaking to a drug-enforcement conference in Rome.", "title": "Pope Francis, True To South American Roots, Condemns \u2018Scourge Of Drug Trafficking\u2019", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pope-francis-stands-against-legalization-marijuana-and-other-recreational-drugs-289132", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/20/pope-francis.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/20/pope-francis.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Drugs", "published_time": "2014-06-20T11:19:47-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-20T11:19:46-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Pope Francis once again condemned the legalization of marijuana and other recreational drugs when speaking to a drug-enforcement conference in Rome."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3587\"", "article_summary": "And so it seems whenever Pope Francis discusses drug policy that his distinctly South American point-of-view is most evident.\nWhen he was 33, he became an ordained priest and from there ascended within the ranks of the Catholic Church, named first a Bishop, then a Cardinal, and now Pope.\nFrancis\u2019 actions also reveal a sense of humility, as when he washed the feet of 12 disabled people during Easter Mass.\nOn Friday the Boston Globe reported the pontiff once again condemned the legalization of marijuana and other recreational drugs, based in part on a clearly intimate knowledge of the chaos wrought by drug cartels and the problems of addiction.\nForcefully, he concluded, \u2018\u2018the problem of drug use is not solved with drugs!\u2019\u2019"}
