Congress on Monday is set to approve the 75th Greater Washington Soap Box Derby, whereby children race on the Capitol grounds in boxes that resemble race cars.

The annual affair, which has been introduced as a resolution for more than two decades by Minority Whip Steny Hoyer, is scheduled for June 18.

“This year marks the 75th anniversary of the Soap Box Derby, and I’m honored to sponsor a resolution for the 25th year allowing this great race to take place on the Capitol grounds,” the Maryland Democrat said in a statement. “Thousands of our local region’s boys and girls have participated in the Derby, and I’m especially proud of those from Maryland’s Fifth District who have competed.”

The House is scheduled to consider the resolution this evening under suspension of the rules.
