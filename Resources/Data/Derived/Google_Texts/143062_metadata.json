A recent study conducted by Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) Kinetics has revealed that the color of your lettuce, whether it be green, semi-red, or red, could determine how fast its antioxidants act.\n\n\u201cThe fact that there are compounds that act at different speeds does not mean that some are better or worse than others,\u201d Dr. Usue P\u00e9rez-L\u00f3pez, from the Department of Plant Biology and Ecology of the UPV/EHU's Faculty of Science and Technology, said in a statement. \u201cIf we eat foods that can generate free-radical activity, there will be some compounds that act to eliminate them more quickly.\u201d\n\nP\u00e9rez-L\u00f3pez and his colleagues used Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) techniques to analyze the compounds found in three varieties of lettuce: the green-leaf \u201cBatavia,\u201d the semi-red-leaf \u201cMarvel of Four Seasons,\u201d and the red-leaf \u201cOak Leaf.\u201d Lettuce is loaded with antioxidants that protect against cell damage and various disease caused by free radical processes. Active compounds found in lettuce include phenolic acids, flavonoids, anthocyanins, and vitamins A and C.\n\nFindings showed that green-leaf lettuce contains water-soluble, antioxidant compounds that act at a slow to intermediate speed. Semi-red-leaf is home to three kinds of compounds that act at a rapid, intermediate, and slow speed. Lastly, red-leaf lettuce has compounds that act at an intermediate and rapid speed.\n\n\u201cIt is also important that our bodies should acquire foods with antioxidants that have slower kinetics so that the latter will continue to act over a longer period of time,\u201d P\u00e9rez-L\u00f3pez explained. \u201cThat is why people say that it is very interesting to mix different types of lettuce because they have different, complementary characteristics.\u201d\n\nThe research team plans on using the results of this study to enhance the health benefits of all three varieties of lettuce. They aim to expose each variety of lettuce to abnormal conditions, such as watering them with saline water, subjecting them to high lighting intensity, or working with raised concentrations of CO2. Exposing lettuce to these conditions activates its defense functions which, in turn, boosts the antioxidant qualities of the plants.\n\n\u201cWhat matters in this process is not to lose productivity, and that is why we apply short-intensity stresses,\u201d P\u00e9rez-L\u00f3pez added. \u201cWith excessive stress, we could reach a point in which plant growth is reduced, and we are not interested in achieving greater quality at the cost of a reduction in size. The aim is to maintain production and achieve greater quality in this production.\u201d\n\nSource: Sgherri C, Ranieri A, Quartacci M, Pinizino C, P\u00e9rez-L\u00f3pez U.
