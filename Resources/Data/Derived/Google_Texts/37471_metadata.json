(Photo: Al Behrman, AP) Story Highlights Taxes are so high, we effectively work more than a quarter of the year without pay.\n\nEver-growing regulatory regime costs us an estimated $1.5 trillion a year.\n\nObamacare nationalizes one-sixth of our economy.\n\nIs today's government dysfunctional? Of course. But not because it can't get things done. The problem is that it does so many things that it shouldn't.\n\nOUR VIEW: 50th anniversaries shame today's government\n\nHappiness, prosperity and innovation aren't gifts from politicians. They are achievements of the free human mind. We need government to protect that freedom. When it instead tramples on individual rights in pursuit of whatever politicians feel is in the public interest, it abandons defined limits and becomes an enemy of freedom and progress.\n\nAnd yet, as then-Rep. Pete Stark, D-Calif., said in 2010, \"The federal government, yes, can do almost anything in this country.\"\n\nThe NSA peeks into our phone records at will. The IRS taxes away so much of our income that we effectively work more than a quarter of the year without pay. Social Security and Medicare turn seniors into government dependents.\n\nThe Federal Register, which lists federal government regulations, takes up more than 30 feet of bookshelf space, and our ever-growing regulatory regime costs us an estimated $1.5 trillion a year.\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department put their antitrust cross hairs on any innovator who has the gall to make large profits. And, of course, there's Obamacare, which nationalizes one-sixth of our economy.\n\nDoes this sound like a government that isn't doing enough?\n\nThe question we need to ask, however, is not whether the government should do more or less, but what should it do.\n\nFor our money, that answer has already been supplied by thinkers such as Ayn Rand and the Founding Fathers.\n\n\"The sum of good government,\" said Thomas Jefferson, is \"a wise and frugal government, which shall restrain men from injuring one another, shall leave them otherwise free to regulate their own pursuits of industry and improvement, and shall not take from the mouth of labor the bread it has earned.\"\n\nThis was the philosophy that made America the freest, most prosperous nation in history. If we want a better, brighter future, the key isn't a more powerful government \u2014 but a free market revolution.\n\nDon Watkins is a fellow at the Ayn Rand Institute. Yaron Brook is its president.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1n3scgX", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "It's not whether government should do more or less, but what should it do.", "og": {"site_name": "USA TODAY", "description": "It's not whether government should do more or less, but what should it do.", "title": "Government tries to do too much: Opposing view", "url": "http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2014/01/26/government-ayn-rand-institute-editorials-debates/4916805/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/usatoday.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "It's not whether government should do more or less, but what should it do.", "title": "Government tries to do too much: Opposing view", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ae756bf5928cdb8ccce454a773ee487c82fd4656/c=1204-0-3934-2730&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/USATODAY/USATODAY/2014/01/26//1390780474000-oppose.jpg", "creator": "@usatoday", "site": "@usatoday", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "fb": {"app_id": 215046668549694}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Topics/Editorials and Debates", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Topics/Editorials and Debates", "title": "Government tries to do too much: Opposing view", "author": "Don Watkins and Yaron Brook", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "opinion", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/51b2240a0fde73a5d790a8df0afefcffaf4cce8a/c=1052-0-3099-2730/local/-/media/USATODAY/USATODAY/2014/01/26//1390780474000-oppose.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/02f8881d5e46a557f2dfbdd39d269ba6e9e3cdc1/c=1204-0-3934-2730/local/-/media/USATODAY/USATODAY/2014/01/26//1390780474000-oppose.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a6ecc588515af1f9ea04bbafc13c4c1c1a05fa9f/c=153-0-3781-2730/local/-/media/USATODAY/USATODAY/2014/01/26//1390780474000-oppose.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9e6be3808a2118520915996a08f1461cf1e5006c/c=0-201-4014-2465&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/USATODAY/USATODAY/2014/01/26//1390780474000-oppose.jpg", "publishtime": "2014-01-26T19:18:58.143000-05:00", "shorthed": "Too much government: Opposing view", "articleid": 4916805, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/977ec74fc118f2aec24745cd5103f832ca978b60/c=0-201-4014-2465/local/-/media/USATODAY/USATODAY/2014/01/26//1390780474000-oppose.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/5c293eb6f35c72330c7c3d2c37e218278b2eb790/c=1469-0-2994-2730/local/-/media/USATODAY/USATODAY/2014/01/26//1390780474000-oppose.jpg"}}, "news_keywords": "government, Ayn Rand Institute, editorials, debates,"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdabe2\"", "article_summary": "Ever-growing regulatory regime costs us an estimated $1.5 trillion a year.\n(Photo: Al Behrman, AP) Story Highlights Taxes are so high, we effectively work more than a quarter of the year without pay.\nThe Federal Register, which lists federal government regulations, takes up more than 30 feet of bookshelf space, and our ever-growing regulatory regime costs us an estimated $1.5 trillion a year.\nAnd yet, as then-Rep.
