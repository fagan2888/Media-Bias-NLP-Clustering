As shown by a Bloomberg poll last week, Americans not only believe that race relations are worsening but they\u2019re also relatively split down the black/white line with whether the deaths were justified by the police officers \u2014 more so with Brown\u2019s death than Garner\u2019s. Here\u2019s the problem: People in general are more empathetic toward whites than blacks; they disregard blacks\u2019 pain. And the only way to build that empathy is to put whites in blacks\u2019 shoes, but how?\n\nA new study from the Royal Holloway University of London and the University of Barcelona shows what initial steps toward this understanding could look like. With virtual reality, researchers were able to create illusions in which white participants were in the body of someone with darker skin. In doing so, they tapped into participants\u2019 implicit biases, and developed a sense of empathy, \u201cintention understanding,\u201d and emotion recognition. In other words, by having participants identify themselves as the other person, they created perceptions of similarity, which in turn made participants more inclined to empathize with blacks \u2014 treat others the way you\u2019d want to be treated, they say.\n\n\u201cOur findings are important as they motivate a new research area into how self-identity is constructed and how boundaries between \u2018in-groups\u2019 and \u2018out-groups\u2019 might be altered,\u201d said Professor Manos Taskiris, of the Department of Psychology at Royal Holloway, in a press release. \u201cMore importantly though, from a societal point of view, our methods and findings might help us understand how to approach phenomena such as racism, religious hatred, and gender inequality discrimination.\u201d\n\nThe researchers used various tests to trick participants\u2019 minds. One of them, called the Rubber Hand Illusion, involved participants sitting under a blanket at a table with a dark rubber hand protruding in front of them. Their real hand, meanwhile, was placed to the side, out of view. Both hands were then stroked, among other sensory cues, creating the illusion the hand was theirs. In another similar experiment, called Enfacement Illusion, the same thing was done to the participants\u2019 faces, while watching a black face on a screen. Finally, in a third experiment, participants were exposed to sensory cues while seeing themselves through a virtual reality device as black.\n\nThese three experiments were effective in reducing racial bias, and boosting feelings of empathy. Trends in Cognitive Sciences, Maister et al.\n\nAfter all three experiments, participants\u2019 implicit attitudes toward blacks were minimized. They were also more likely to report the other person\u2019s face as being more attractive, more physically similar to their own, and they said they were also more likely to conform to the other person\u2019s opinions. This last finding is perhaps the most important, because it\u2019s one thing to empathize with another person\u2019s pain and physical feelings, but to have long-lasting effects that stimulate change in social attitudes is something the researchers acknowledge is still unclear.\n\nWith about 40 percent of white Americans surrounded exclusively by friends of their own race, becoming exposed to people of other races could be the best way to quell anxieties. It may not even require these types of experiments. A study from last week found that sending gay canvassers into strongly anti-gay neighborhoods to talk to residents for about 20 minutes about marriage equality, and why it mattered, was effective in changing their attitudes about gays even nine months later. If exposing these anti-gay residents to gay people and their stories could change perception, surely exposing whites to blacks and their stories could as well.\n\nSource: Maister L, Slater M, Sanchez-Vivez M, Tsakiris M.
