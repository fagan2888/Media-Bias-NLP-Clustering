Pete Aguilar, D-Redlands, was one of four Democrats and 43 first-year representatives to sign a letter to House Speaker John Boehner this week urging him to repeal a tax on medical devices tied to the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe letter maintains that the 2.3 percent tax on pacemakers, artificial joints and similar devices hurts the medical device industry and \u201cputs the discovery of new breakthrough medical technologies at risk.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs freshman members, we made a promise to our constituents to usher in a new era of cooperation in order to restore faith in our government institutions,\u201d the letter read.\n\n\u201cRepealing the medical device tax is too important to our constituents and small businesses not to act immediately, and proves that we can come together with solutions.\u201d\n\nMedical Device Tax Letter\n\nAguilar was the only Inland congressional representative to sign the letter to Boehner, R-Ohio.\n\nHis district includes a number of medical device manufacturers, according to spokeswoman Sarah Weinstein. Aguilar represents California\u2019s 31st Congressional District, which includes Redlands, Loma Linda, Colton, Grand Terrace, Rancho Cucamonga and the city of San Bernardino.\n\nAguilar, a former Redlands mayor, won a competitive election last year with the help of out-of-district donors and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Since taking office in January, he has held a rally in support of President Barack Obama\u2019s actions on immigration and raised the prospect of professional sanctions against the California lawyer behind a proposed ballot measure that would allow gay people to be killed.\n\nHe already faces a re-election challenger in Republican Paul Chabot, who lost to Aguilar in November.", "article_metadata": {"geo.region": "US-CA", "sailthru.author": "JEFF HORSEMAN", "content_author": "JEFF HORSEMAN", "ICBM": "33.948100, -117.396100", "sailthru.tags": "blogs, medical, tax, device, pete, urging, devices, repeal, aguilar, letter, artificial", "content_section": "blogs", "content_title": "CONGRESS: Pete Aguilar joins Republicans in urging repeal of medical device tax", "geo.position": "33.948100;-117.396100", "author": "JEFF HORSEMAN", "section": "blogs", "sailthru.date": "2015-04-02 10:26:12", "sailthru.title": "Blog: Political Empire:CONGRESS: Pete Aguilar joins Republicans in urging repeal of medical device tax", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nm6w9p-aguilar.jpg", "geo.placename": "Riverside", "fb": {"app_id": 1413700038878423}, "content_thumbnail": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nm6w9p-aguilar.jpg", "content_type": "article", "publication_date": "2015-04-02", "Description": "CONGRESS: Pete Aguilar joins Republicans in urging repeal of medical device tax | medical, tax, device, pete, urging, devices, repeal, aguilar, letter, artificial", "og": {"site_name": "Press Enterprise", "description": "CONGRESS: Pete Aguilar joins Republicans in urging repeal of medical device tax | medical, tax, device, pete, urging, devices, repeal, aguilar, letter, artificial", "title": "Blog: Political Empire:CONGRESS: Pete Aguilar joins Republicans in urging repeal of medical device tax", "locale": "en", "image": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/article/nm6w9p-aguilar.jpg", "url": "http://www.pe.com/articles/medical-763749-tax-device.html", "type": "article"}, "Keywords": "medical, tax, device, pete, urging, devices, repeal, aguilar, letter, artificial", "sailthru.image.full": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/nm6w9p-aguilar.jpg"}, "article_summary": "His district includes a number of medical device manufacturers, according to spokeswoman Sarah Weinstein.\nAguilar represents California\u2019s 31st Congressional District, which includes Redlands, Loma Linda, Colton, Grand Terrace, Rancho Cucamonga and the city of San Bernardino.\n\u201cRepealing the medical device tax is too important to our constituents and small businesses not to act immediately, and proves that we can come together with solutions.\u201dMedical Device Tax LetterAguilar was the only Inland congressional representative to sign the letter to Boehner, R-Ohio.\nRep.
