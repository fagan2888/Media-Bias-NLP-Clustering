Bay County's week-long Central Panhandle Fair was not cancelled Saturday but did see fewer visitors as well.

In the past, fair organizers say the two weekend days bring in the most business, but tropical storm Karen threatened this year's business.

Friday, more than 25-hundred people came out to enjoy the fair.

Saturday that number dropped to less than 200 visitors.

General Manger Bob Johnson said, "I hope it does i hope it passes because there's a lot of people that haven't gotten to go to the fair yet. This is the last day. They end up missing it. I hope they don't."

Johnson said if lightning or flooding happens the fair would be shut down.
