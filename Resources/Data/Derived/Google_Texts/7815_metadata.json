Rather, they\u2019ll have to submit additional documentation to ensure that they\u2019re getting the correct level of tax credits.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Full health care policy coverage)\n\nThose receiving too great a subsidy could be asked to repay a portion, however, and in some cases, if enrollees don\u2019t provide additional data, their coverage could be rescinded.\n\n\u201cThe Marketplace checked to see that consumers are who they said they were, matching Social Security numbers, income and tribal status, among a host of other data points \u2014 all to ensure that folks are eligible for coverage and, in many cases, entitled to financial assistance to help them afford their plan \u2026 But, while most information the applicant provided lined up, sometimes a name or data point didn\u2019t match up right away with existing records,\u201d CMS spokeswoman Julie Bataille wrote in a blog post.\n\n\u201cFor example, a consumer might have recently changed jobs, but the latest IRS tax return data and other data available to the Marketplace didn\u2019t reflect that change in income,\u201d Bataille continued. \u201cIn such cases, the law requires us to double and triple check this data in another way.\u201d\n\nThe 2 million people asked to provide additional information represent about one in four of the 8 million people who signed up for coverage through ACA exchanges during the 2014 enrollment season. Bataille said those in the process of submitting additional information retain their health coverage in the interim.\n\nThe administration also posted an FAQ on HealthCare.gov today for people who are asked to submit more information to their exchanges.\n\nAbout half of the application discrepancies involved people\u2019s incomes, which often didn\u2019t match their most recent IRS data, according to those news reports. The other half involved immigration or residency status, an issue administration officials attributed to misspelled names or expired documents.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "If enrollees don\u2019t provide additional data, their Obamacare coverage could be rescinded.", "title": "2M ACA enrollees asked for more info", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/06/obamacare-affordable-care-act-107436.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/04/25/140425_obamacare_gty_605.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Obamacare,Health Care,Affordable Care Act", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "If enrollees don\u2019t provide additional data, their Obamacare coverage could be rescinded.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd824f\"", "article_summary": "2M ACA enrollees asked for more infoAbout 2 million people enrolled in Obamacare exchanges submitted information that doesn\u2019t match up with federal records, potentially jeopardizing the coverage and federal subsidies for some of them, the Obama administration said Wednesday afternoon.\nThose receiving too great of an Obamacare subsidy could be asked to repay a portion.\nBataille said those in the process of submitting additional information retain their health coverage in the interim.\nThe administration also posted an FAQ on HealthCare.gov today for people who are asked to submit more information to their exchanges.\n( Also on POLITICO: Full health care policy coverage)Those receiving too great a subsidy could be asked to repay a portion, however, and in some cases, if enrollees don\u2019t provide additional data, their coverage could be rescinded."}
