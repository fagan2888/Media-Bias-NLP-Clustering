He is in Findlay today to attend the memorial service for former U.S. Rep. Michael Oxley, who died Jan. 1.\n\nJordan said Republicans believe their representatives should have fought harder to prevent passage of Obamacare and other tax-and-spend legislation.\n\n\u201c60 percent of Republican voters feel that Republican leaders in Congress had betrayed them. Not just disappointed, not just not fighting hard enough. Betrayal,\u201d Jordan said, citing a Washington Post poll conducted in September.\n\nRepublicans are looking for an outsider for president. That\u2019s why in the Iowa Caucus this week, 29 percent favored U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas; 25 percent favored Trump, nearly 10 percent favored physician Ben Carson and 2 percent favored former Arkansas Gov.
