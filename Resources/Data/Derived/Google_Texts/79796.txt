Custer, SD

A visitor to Custer State Park is recovering after being gored by a buffalo.

Around 7:30 Monday night, the woman was taking pictures in a meadow south of the Legion Lake Campground. The animal, which was a couple hundred feet away, walked toward her. As it passed, the buffalo swung its head, catching her leg with its horn.

The woman was able to walk back to her car and was transported to the Custer Hospital by ambulance with non-life threatening injuries.

Park officials say it's a good reminder that all wildlife in Custer State Park should be viewed from a safe distance or from within a closed vehicle.
