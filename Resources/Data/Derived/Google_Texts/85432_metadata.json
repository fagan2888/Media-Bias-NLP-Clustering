(Happily, with the exception of its title, \u201cHigh Time\u201d is refreshingly free of bad puns and Cheetos jokes.) Citing \u201cvast social costs,\u201d \u201cracist results,\u201d and \u201coverwhelming evidence that addiction and dependence are relatively minor problems,\u201d the Timeseditorial board advocated a repeal of the nation\u2019s cannabis prohibition. Ad Policy\n\nLast November, of course, The Nation went all-in on marijuana-law reform with our \u201cDope and Change\u201d issue, and I wrote, \u201cIf Congress\u2014with its dismal 8 percent approval rating\u2014wants to enjoy a popularity as high as marijuana\u2019s, it might consider revisiting pot\u2019s federal prohibition.\u201d The blanket federal ban is unworkable on many levels, not least of which is the capriciousness of its enforcement: Given the crazy-quilt of state and local medicinal and decriminalization laws, the actual prohibition of marijuana in this country comes down to, as the Times puts it, \u201cthe whims of whoever happens to be in the White House and chooses to enforce or not enforce the federal law.\u201d Needless to say, this type of jurisprudence is neither fair nor just; Harry Levine reported in \u201cDope and Change\u201d that since 1997 in New York City, 87 percent of NYPD\u2019s 600,000 marijuana-possession arrests were of blacks and Latinos.\n\nThe data-driven, nuts-and-bolts reasons for legalization are legion, and\u2014to an unbiased eye\u2014overwhelmingly convincing. But the bias behind prohibition, born out of 1920s- and \u201930s-era xenophobia and racism, continues to impress itself on the minds of pundits and policymakers across the political spectrum. \u201cThe problem that prohibition advocates have,\u201d writes Paul Waldman at The American Prospect, \u201cis that so much of their rhetoric hasn\u2019t changed in decades, steeped in culture war resentments and reliant on fear-mongering.\u201d A 2008 article on AlterNet illustrates that twentieth-century drug prohibition was born in places where white minorities ruled over non-white majorities\u2014South Africa and Jamaica, for example\u2014before becoming a xenophobic tool of law enforcement (against Latinos in California and Texas, Middle Eastern immigrants in New York, Asians on the Pacific Coast) in places with white majorities.\n\nAn examination into the whys and wherefores of our broken cannabis policy is well overdue. After all, this story can and should be about more than just marijuana. American pot prohibition ought to be seen as a cautionary tale of what happens when we create policy based not on appropriately reasoned ideas, but rather on fear, racism and the sensational-but-unfounded caterwauling of policymakers and think-tankers who should know better.\n\nIf American drug prohibition laws were enacted, as is convincingly argued, in the service of furthering discrimination, then you\u2019d have to say\u2014based on the arrest and incarceration numbers\u2014that they\u2019ve been a smashing success. But as far as advancing public health goes\u2026 well, they\u2019re a disaster. This discrepancy is worth noting. At a time when governmental dysfunction is so prevalent and the demand for congressional action\u2014any action\u2014is high, we need to be aware of the real motives we\u2019re asking our elected officials to promote (For example, how much of our \u201chomeland security\u201d policy is actually driven by xenophobia and racism? How much resistance to the Affordable Care Act?). With marijuana, bigotry-based policy has delivered a nearly 100-year-long quagmire from which we\u2019re only now beginning to extricate ourselves with fact-based debate and informed dissent.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/marijuana_rtr_img_2-275x173.jpg", "sailthru.author": "Katrina vanden Heuvel", "description": "An examination into our broken cannabis policy is well overdue\u2014and should be about more than just marijuana.", "generator": "WooCommerce 2.3.13", "og": {"site_name": "The Nation", "description": "An examination into our broken cannabis policy is well overdue\u2014and should be about more than just marijuana.", "title": "The End of Reefer Madness?", "url": "http://www.thenation.com/article/end-reefer-madness/", "image": {"width": 1500, "identifier": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/marijuana_rtr_img_2.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 1000}, "updated_time": "2015-06-29T08:27:07+00:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "An examination into our broken cannabis policy is well overdue\u2014and should be about more than just marijuana.", "title": "The End of Reefer Madness?", "url": "http://www.thenation.com/article/end-reefer-madness/", "image": {"height": 1000, "src": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/marijuana_rtr_img_2.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/marijuana_rtr_img_2-1440x756.jpg", "width": 1500}, "site": "@TheNation", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "August 4th, 2014", "sailthru.title": "The End of Reefer Madness?", "keywords": "The Nation, Katrina vanden Heuvel, marijuana, prohibition, legalization, drug policy, race", "fb": {"app_id": 192399944158735}, "sailthru.content_id": 112358, "sailthru.tags": "Drug War and Drug Policy,Blog", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheNationMagazine", "tag": "race", "published_time": "2014-08-04T14:56:54+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-29T08:27:07+00:00", "author": "http://www.thenation.com/author/katrina-vanden-heuvel/"}, "sailthru.description": "An examination into our broken cannabis policy is well overdue\u2014and should be about more than just marijuana.", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/marijuana_rtr_img_2-680x430.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "With marijuana, bigotry-based policy has delivered a nearly 100-year-long quagmire from which we\u2019re only now beginning to extricate ourselves with fact-based debate and informed dissent.\n(Happily, with the exception of its title, \u201cHigh Time\u201d is refreshingly free of bad puns and Cheetos jokes.)\nBut the bias behind prohibition, born out of 1920s- and \u201930s-era xenophobia and racism, continues to impress itself on the minds of pundits and policymakers across the political spectrum.\nAn examination into the whys and wherefores of our broken cannabis policy is well overdue.\nCiting \u201cvast social costs,\u201d \u201cracist results,\u201d and \u201coverwhelming evidence that addiction and dependence are relatively minor problems,\u201d the Timeseditorial board advocated a repeal of the nation\u2019s cannabis prohibition."}
