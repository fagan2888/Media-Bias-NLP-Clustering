The 2014 South Central Ohio Healthcare Supplier Diversity Symposium recently announced Donna Brazile, political commentator and strategist, will deliver the keynote address during its Spirit of Diversity Awards Luncheon at the event on Tuesday, April 8 at the Kingsgate Marriott Conference Center. In the morning, there will be a Corporate Roundtable Discussion with Susan DeVore, President & CEO of Premier, Inc., Reuben Shaffer, Chief Diversity Officer for The Kroger Co., and David Wheeler, Senior Vice President of Global Supply Chain and Corporate Six Sigma at the Cintas Corporation.

“There is no more fitting way to celebrate the 5th anniversary of the Symposium than by hearing Ms. Brazile, a brilliant political commentator, strategist, and author, discuss The Affordable Care Act and how it impacts economic inclusion,” said Howard D. Elliott, President of Elliott Management Group and Co-Producer of the Symposium. “Ms. Brazile and our other distinguished presenters will challenge the more than 350 chief executive officers, senior executives, supply chain management, and diversity advocates to boldly explore new ways to increase diverse spend in the entire healthcare supply chain throughout Cincinnati, Columbus, Dayton, and Northern Kentucky.”

Since 2010, the Symposium has impacted over $70 million in new contracts for minority and women owned businesses. This year’s new Mini-Tradeshow and Chief Purchasing Officer Interviews segment is designed to create even more contracts by giving MBEs and WBEs an opportunity to meet one-on-one with key leaders in the organizations where they seek to do business.

The 2014 South Central Ohio Healthcare Supplier Diversity Symposium is presented by Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center, Guy Brown, Premier Inc., SFA Architects, and UC Health.
