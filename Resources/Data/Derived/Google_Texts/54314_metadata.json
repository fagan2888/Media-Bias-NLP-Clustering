The ruling marked a watershed win for liberals, but the biggest surprise was ultraconservative Justice Clarence Thomas, who joined them in finding Texas did not violate the First Amendment when it denied the Confederate group\u2019s request for plates.\n\nThe decision in Walker v. Sons of Confederate Veterans comes at a sobering moment for the country, as the people of Charleston, South Carolina, come to grips with a deadly shooting at a historic black church there. Rarely does a decision of the Supreme Court \u2014 often shrouded in legal formalisms and procedural abstractions \u2014 meet so directly with a real-time tragedy in the headlines. But Walker is such a case: Vox reports that even now, a Confederate flag still flies in the South Carolina statehouse.\n\nThe case began with a coalition of groups and citizens \u2014 including the NAACP, clergy, and elected officials \u2014 worried about what Confederate-flag plates would represent. They lobbied the Texas Department of Motor Vehicles to reject them. In the face of the outcry, the agency said \u201cthat a significant portion of the public associates the Confederate flag with organizations advocating expressions of hate directed toward people or groups that is demeaning to those people or groups,\u201d and declined to issue the plates. In response, the Sons of Confederate Veterans brought suit in federal court and ultimately won at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, which said Texas engaged in \u201cimpermissible viewpoint discrimination\u201d and thus violated its free-speech rights.\n\nThe Supreme Court sided 5-to-4 with Texas and ruled that denying the license plates did not run afoul of the Constitution. In the decision, Justice Stephen Breyer said that the issuance of license plates represents \u201cgovernment speech\u201d and thus is not subject to \u201cthe First Amendment rules designed to protect the marketplace of ideas.\u201d In other words, governments are allowed to make viewpoint determinations of their own \u2014 and do all the time \u2014 and are only beholden to the democratic process to judge the value of what is said.\n\n\u201cWhen the government speaks, it is not barred by the Free Speech Clause from determining the content of what it says,\u201d Breyer wrote, and then continued: \u201cWere the Free Speech Clause interpreted otherwise, government would not work.\u201d He offered examples where government promotes programs and ideas, like vaccination drives and recycling programs, that might not be universally supported. According to the court, government has the freedom to select the views it wishes to espouse. And in this case, Texas was ruled to be within its rights in rejecting what the Confederate flag stands for and denying the request for the plates.\n\nThis pragmatic, no-nonsense approach is signature Breyer \u2014 for posterity, he even included an appendix with the proposed license-plate design \u2014 which may explain why Thomas joined him and his colleagues. Never mind that Thomas is a strong respecter of states\u2019 rights and may indeed understand why Texas made the judgment call it did \u2014 he\u2019s not one to second-guess democratic choices. But there\u2019s also the specter of Virginia v. Black, a 2003 case where Thomas, dissenting alone, said that there are \u201ccertain things\u201d \u2014 in that case, cross-burning \u2014 that \u201cacquire meaning well beyond what outsiders can comprehend.\u201d He said the practice crossed the line into the \u201cprofane,\u201d and given the weight of history in Virginia and the rest of the South, it couldn\u2019t be considered \u201cspeech,\u201d but \u201cconduct.\u201d And thus the First Amendment was no bar to criminalizing the act.\n\n\u201cAnd, just as one cannot burn down someone\u2019s house to make a political point and then seek refuge in the First Amendment,\u201d Thomas wrote, \u201cthose who hate cannot terrorize and intimidate to make their point.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#000", "description": "The decision hinged on an unusual break from his conservative colleagues by Clarence Thomas.", "generator": "the-factory", "og": {"site_name": "Daily Intelligencer", "description": "The decision hinged on an unusual break from his conservative colleagues by Clarence Thomas.", "title": "In the Wake of a Horrifying Hate Crime, Supreme Court Rules on Confederate-Flag License Plates", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2015/06/after-charleston-scotus-rules-on-stars-and-bars.html", "image": "http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2015/06/18/18-texas-licence-plate-2.w1200.h630.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The decision hinged on an unusual break from his conservative colleagues by Clarence Thomas.", "creator": "@cristianafarias", "image": "http://cache.nymag.com/media/di/icon.1500x1500.png", "title": "After Charleston, SCOTUS Rules on Stars and Bars", "site": "@intelligencer", "card": "summary"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Daily Intelligencer", "fb": {"app_id": 120608177953522}, "msapplication-TileImage": "//cache.nymag.com/media/di/icon.144x144.png", "application-name": "Daily Intelligencer", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "keywords": "scotus, confederate flag, clarence thomas, stephen breyer", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/NewYorkMag", "tag": "scotus,confederate flag,clarence thomas,stephen breyer", "published_time": "2015-06-18T16:41:00.000Z"}, "topics": "topics-test, scotus, confederate flag, clarence thomas, stephen breyer", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no"}, "article_summary": "But Walker is such a case: Vox reports that even now, a Confederate flag still flies in the South Carolina statehouse.\nAnd in this case, Texas was ruled to be within its rights in rejecting what the Confederate flag stands for and denying the request for the plates.\nThe Supreme Court sided 5-to-4 with Texas and ruled that denying the license plates did not run afoul of the Constitution.\nThe case began with a coalition of groups and citizens \u2014 including the NAACP, clergy, and elected officials \u2014 worried about what Confederate-flag plates would represent.\nRarely does a decision of the Supreme Court \u2014 often shrouded in legal formalisms and procedural abstractions \u2014 meet so directly with a real-time tragedy in the headlines."}
