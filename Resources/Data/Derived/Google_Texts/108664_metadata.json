Now the company\u2019s ability to repay its loans may be looking grim, The Des Moines Register reports.\n\nDaniel Watkins, a lawyer designated as the special deputy liquidator charged with helping dissolve CoOportunity Health, which formerly served Iowa\u2019s and Nebraska\u2019s Obamacare exchanges, filed a status report Friday in Iowa\u2019s Polk County District Court, raising more questions about CoOportunity\u2019s financial status.\n\nWhile CoOportunity retains just $109 million in assets, it has over $282 million in liabilities, according to Watkins. Some of that money will be offset by a trio of risk mitigation policies in place at Obamacare exchanges \u2014 the reinsurance, risk adjustment and risk corridor mechanisms. CoOportunity is still negotiating the process with the federal Obamacare agency, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, but the pools are unlikely to meet the total funding the company requires.\n\nAfter coming up with a $163 million operating loss during its first year as an nonprofit insurer, CoOportunity still owes federal taxpayers $147 million in start-up loans originally doled out by the Obama administration as part of the health-care law.\n\nWatkins believes CoOportunity will bring in another $97 million for its services this year \u2014 but most of that will be owed to guaranty associations who have been covering medical bills for the company\u2019s customers. Watkins doesn\u2019t believe the new income will even begin to cover federal taxpayer loans.\n\nPart of CoOportunity\u2019s debts, however, include payments to insurance agents who sold the company\u2019s policies but have yet to be paid for their services. Doctors, hospitals, clinics and other health-care providers have been paid, however, Watkins maintained.\n\nSome customers faced financial difficulties as a result of the co-ops collapse as well. As CoOportunity\u2019s customers switched coverage after the company was officially declared insolvent in March 2015, some had to begin paying their deductibles all over again after already making headway on the payments in January.\n\nCoOportunity is the first Obamacare co-op to go under, but it will already be joined by a second this year. Louisiana Health Co-operative will shut down Dec. 31, 2015, according to Modern Healthcare. In all, at 19 of 23 nonprofits created by the law, losses exceeded the companies\u2019 own projections for the first year of Obamacare\u2019s operation.
