Obama vetoes Keystone pipeline bill because … it infringes on the executive branch’s prerogatives

A tip o’ the cap to O, after waging unauthorized war in multiple countries, rewriting various parts of the ObamaCare statute, and proclaiming by royal decree that amnesty hath come to America, for having the mammoth balls here to complain that Congress is stepping on his turf.

The bit about “circumventing longstanding processes” is a reference to the loooooooong State Department review — six years and counting — of whether Keystone, which would create more than 40,000 jobs during its construction, is in the “national interest.” That review is supposedly what’s being “cut short” by the bill on Obama’s desk. Although Sean Davis is right: In an era of unilateral presidential lawmaking, Congress attempting to set policy with bipartisan support (this one got 63 votes last month) itself qualifies as “circumventing longstanding processes.”

McConnell says he’s going to try to override Obama’s veto with 67 Senate votes but no one thinks he can pull that many. The question now is whether Obama will use the veto as a bargaining chip, with approval of Keystone to follow if the GOP plays ball on another of his priorities, or if this is just a favor to his fabulously wealthy environmentalist donor base that nothing else will trump. I know how I’m betting.

Via the Free Beacon, here’s the White Press Corps laughing at Josh Earnest today when he explains why six years isn’t necessarily a long time to review whether to build a pipeline. Look on the bright side: At least the Saudis will be happy.
