Firefighters said it was a miracle they were able to save 85 percent of the church, which was built in 1896.\n\nAfter the fire, which was ruled accidental, members of Saint Paul\u2019s in the Pines Episcopal Church invited St. Joseph\u2019s members to Easter service.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t ever forget this,\u201d said Rev. Teddra Smith, St. Joseph\u2019s pastor. \u201cEven when we go back in, it's like the scriptures have really come alive and sometimes God uses the experiences in our life to make it come alive.\u201d\n\nSmith saw Sunday\u2019s service as something that was meant to be.\n\n\u201cI know that God has his hand in doing something more than we can ever imagine that he's doing, but I think the first thing that he's doing is bringing us all together like he should be,\u201d he said.\n\nSt. Joseph\u2019s members like Donald LaHuffman were excited about the joint service.\n\n\u201cIt's a period of enthusiasm in keeping with the Easter season of resurrection and new birth, so we will rise again and we will make our church better,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30;polling-uri=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=1;polling-uri2=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=2;polling-uri3=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=3;polling-uri4=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=4;polling-uri5=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=5;cycle=1", "dcterms.created": "2015-04-05 18:28:11", "description": "On Easter Sunday, parishioners at Saint Joseph's Episcopal Church have a new understanding of resurrection and rebirth.", "application-name": "WRAL.com", "dcterms.modified": "2015-04-05 18:28:11", "outbrain": {"ob_desc": "id_asset=14561788|asset_type=story"}, "twitter": {"description": "On Easter Sunday, parishioners at Saint Joseph's Episcopal Church have a new understanding of resurrection and rebirth.", "title": "Resurrection, rebirth has new meaning for Fayetteville church on Easter Sunday :: WRAL.com", "url": "http://www.wral.com/resurrection-rebirth-has-new-meaning-for-fayetteville-church-on-easter-sunday/14561788/", "image": "http://wwwcache.wral.com/asset/news/local/2015/04/05/14561872/14561872-1428272658-160x120.jpg", "site": "@wral", "card": "summary"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#041E30", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/favicons/mstile-70x70.png", "robots": "index,follow", "pinterest": "nohover", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/favicons/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/favicons/mstile-310x150.png", "fb": {"app_id": 334167666672300}, "author": "WRAL", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-05T18:28:11-04:00"}, "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/favicons/mstile-150x150.png", "og": {"site_name": "WRAL.com", "description": "On Easter Sunday, parishioners at Saint Joseph's Episcopal Church have a new understanding of resurrection and rebirth.", "title": "Resurrection, rebirth has new meaning for Fayetteville church on Easter Sunday :: WRAL.com", "url": "http://www.wral.com/resurrection-rebirth-has-new-meaning-for-fayetteville-church-on-easter-sunday/14561788/", "image": "http://wwwcache.wral.com/asset/news/local/2015/04/05/14561872/177754-15621-20150405180908-StanTheMan-frame-1-960x540.jpg", "type": "article"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "msapplication-TileImage": "/favicons/mstile-144x144.png"}, "article_summary": "After the fire, which was ruled accidental, members of Saint Paul\u2019s in the Pines Episcopal Church invited St. Joseph\u2019s members to Easter service.\nSt. Joseph\u2019s members like Donald LaHuffman were excited about the joint service.\nThe historic Fayetteville church sustained water and smoke damage after fire spread through part of the building last month.\nTeddra Smith, St. Joseph\u2019s pastor.\n\u201cIt's a period of enthusiasm in keeping with the Easter season of resurrection and new birth, so we will rise again and we will make our church better,\u201d he said."}
