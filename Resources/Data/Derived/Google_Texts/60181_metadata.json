(Republican Eagle photo by Joe Brown)\n\nRed Wing trailed Winona 24-21 at halftime in Saturday\u2019s Section 1AAA semifinal game. But in the locker room, the Wingers were not at a loss of confidence that they would get back into the game.\n\n\u201cOnly being down by three at halftime, I thought it was almost an advantage for us,\u201d said Red Wing head coach Doug Toivonen. \u201cI remember when we played New Prague last year in the section semifinal, we were down by three or four at halftime and thought that we were ahead because we hadn\u2019t played very well in the game.\u201d\n\nWith the offense picking up in the second half and the man-to-man defense continuing to give the Winhawks fits, the second-seeded Wingers clinched a spot in the section finals for the second straight year with a 55-47 victory over the third-seeded Winhawks at Sonju Gymnasium.\n\n\u201cWe were like, \u201cAll right, the shots are going to come (in the second half.\u2019 They usually come in the second half,\u201d said Red Wing senior Isaac Toivonen. \u201cWe knew we were going to come back and we did.\u201d\n\nHolding a team to 24 points in a half is normally enough to take command in a game, but the Wingers offense had trouble clicking in the first 18 minutes.\n\n\u201cYou could tell our kids were pretty nervous. We played nervous, missing some easy bunnies, and once you miss those easy shots, it\u2019s kind of hard to get the momentum back,\u201d Doug Toivonen said.\n\nRed Wing needed a lift, and that came on both ends of the floor from senior guard Nick Powers. Down 24-23, Powers hit a 3-pointer that gave the Wingers a 26-24 lead with 15 minutes, 38 seconds to go. After a 3-point play from Isaac Toivonen, Powers drilled another 3-pointer to cap off an 11-2 run and put Red Wing up 32-26.\n\n\u201cCoach just said we needed someone to step up and hit a shot and get the second half to good start,\u201d Powers said. \u201cThe shot fell for me. \u2026 After that, everyone started having confidence, coming down fast and playing good \u2018D.\u2019 It was a huge momentum swing.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter (Powers\u2019 3-pointers), we were hitting layups left and right and we got a couple and-1s,\u201d said Isaac Toivonen, who finished with 13 points and eight rebounds.\n\nThen in Winona\u2019s next trip down the floor, Powers drew a charging foul and gave the team another much-needed lift.\n\n\u201cPowers was huge tonight,\u201d Doug Toivonen said. \u201cHe had a couple big 3s in the second half and I thought defensively, he was huge tonight. He played really well tonight and he sparked us in the second half.\u201d\n\nThen midway through the second, Red Wing pieced together another big run, scoring seven straight points to go up 42-31 with 7:47 remaining.\n\nFrom that point, the Wingers\u2019 lockdown defense kept it a two-possession game the rest of the way. Winona had just three field goals in the first eight minutes of the second half, and after scoring 14 points in the first half, the Winhawks\u2019 Jeff Schultz had just one point the rest of the way.\n\n\u201cWe really challenged Ben Miller to take (Schultz) and keep him out of the paint,\u201d Doug Toivonen said. \u201cBen did a great job of stepping up to that challenge.\n\nDoug Toivonen added, \u201cWe knew going in we were going to have to play good one-on-one defense and I thought we did that.\u201d\n\nTy Buck had a team-high 15 points for Red Wing, and Jon Sevlie scored eight of his nine points in the first half. Miller hauled in a team-high 10 rebounds.\n\nDrew Thompson finished with 11 points for the Winhawks, and Trey Bechly had nine in the loss.\n\nAfter disposing of Winona, Red Wing (19-8) is set for a rematch of last year\u2019s section semifinal against top-seeded Austin. The Wingers and Packers will tip off at 8 p.m. Friday at the Mayo Civic Center in Rochester.\n\nAustin (25-3) advanced to the 1AAA final after dismantling New Prague 79-64 Saturday in Austin.\n\nLast season, Austin fought off Red Wing for a 52-43 overtime win in the section final. Then this season, back on Dec. 20, the Packers rocked the Wingers with a 53-37 victory in Austin.\n\n\u201cWe know how good (Austin) is. We know what it\u2019s going to take to beat them. Whether we can go out and execute that plan, that\u2019s a whole different story,\u201d Doug Toivonen said. \u201cThey\u2019re very, very good, they\u2019re very battle tested and they play a very good schedule. Their kids know how to win, and our kids do, too.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to step up and challenge them and see if we can\u2019t shock the world.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "sports,wingers,boys basketball,Red Wing", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Joe Brown", "og": {"site_name": "Republican Eagle", "description": "Red Wing trailed Winona 24-21 at halftime in Saturday\u2019s Section 1AAA semifinal game.
