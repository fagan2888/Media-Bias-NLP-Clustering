While seniors may tend to report scams more than other age groups, officials said it seems they are often targeted as a demographic. San Mateo County Deputy Sheriff Ronald DeRespini estimated nearly 40 percent of the scam reports he received between 2008 and 2014 came from senior citizens.San Mateo County authorities are now bolstering an education campaign, in response to requests from constituents, designed to help seniors from becoming victims of fraud.\u201cBecause we are an aging county and an aging state, seniors are a target-rich environment, if you will, for scam artists,\u201d Assemblymember Kevin Mullin (D-San Mateo) said in an interview.\n\nMullin hosted two seminars \u2013 called \u201cSenior Scam Stoppers\u201d \u2013 this fall.\n\n\u201cMy own father was scammed at his home,\u201d he added. \u201cThis is, I think, a fairly common theme throughout my district \u2013 that people are getting calls, people are getting visits.\u201dThe \u201cSenior Scam Stoppers\u201d seminars work in partnership with the Contractors State License Board, the California State Controller\u2019s Office, the California Public Utilities Commission, as well as local law enforcement. Panels of experts provide tips to avoid victimization and answers local seniors\u2019 questions on scamming.\u201cIf it sounds too good to be true, it probably is,\u201d DeRespini told a \u201cSenior Scam Stoppers\u201d audience at the San Carlos Adult Community Center on Oct. 3.The seminars aim to demystify common scams and caution seniors to be skeptical of unexpected solicitations of any kind \u2013 or, better yet, to refrain from participating in solicitations at all.\u201cThis is one of the only crimes where the victim can prevent it before it happens,\u201d DeRespini said. \u201cHere, the victim is being talked into being a victim of a crime.\u201dRedwood City resident Leonard Sklar, 80, attended the Oct. 3 seminar eager to share his story. He lost $150,000 in a business investment Ponzi scheme, in which at least seven other people were also tricked out of large sums.Sklar heard about the opportunity from a friend and did adequate background checking on the investment, he explained. Yet after only three months of returned interest, the business abruptly shut down \u2013 and his money was gone.\u201cScammers have wonderful excuses,\u201d Sklar said. \u201cLook out for these people. They are very slick, very believable, very credible.\u201dSklar came to the seminar in part to hear about what other scams may be lurking and also to let others hear his story \u201cas a warning.\u201d\u201cSenior Scam Stoppers\u201d seminars have been offered across the county for years. Yet in San Mateo County, it appears the demand for such information has never been greater. Over 200 seniors attended the most recent seminar \u2013 the largest San Mateo County turnout in recent memory.Officials say the uptick may stem in part from publicity around a telephone scam sweeping California, in which con artists pose as IRS agents demanding back tax payment under threat of arrest. First official notices of this IRS scam began around October 2013.\u201cWhen people hear things on the news, there\u2019s a fear factor,\u201d said Jane Kreidler, outreach coordinator for the Contractors State License Board. Seniors \u201cwant to keep apprised of what the new scams are.\u201dIRS scams make up a significant portion of reported scams in San Mateo County in the last year, according to the County Sheriff\u2019s Office.San Carlos resident Richard Rescho, 66, remembers his brush with an IRS scam after receiving voicemail accusing him of a tax violation and demanding contact by phone. Fortunately, he sensed something strange.\u201cI could tell it was phony,\u201d Rescho said. \u201cMy feeling was annoyance, not anxiety or fear, just annoyance.\u201dHe avoided falling victim by responding to the scam in remarkably good form: he reported the incident right away to the FBI in San Francisco and to the Federal Trade Commission.Yet many seniors are not as suspicious, thorough or proactive at the sight of a scam. Kreidler says that\u2019s what scammers are counting on.\u201cSeniors grew up in a generation where people weren\u2019t trying to lighten their pocketbooks,\u201d she said.Mullin\u2019s office is considering to host additional \u201cmini-seminar\u201d events later this year.These would be modified versions of the recent seminars, to be offered in various locations throughout the Peninsula and perhaps even to other at-risk populations such as immigrants or citizens with English-language challenges.Beyond the seminar approach, Mullin\u2019s office routinely creates email blasts and online news releases with new scam information.For now, Rescho explained that even he learned plenty of new tips at the seminar.\u201cI think it\u2019s a very important service,\u201d he said. \u201cAs seniors, we are viewed as an easy target, and it\u2019s important that we know what the potential dangers are and how to deal with it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Peninsula Press", "description": "Financial scams in San Mateo County are disproportionately affecting senior citizens, leading to a surge in seniors seeking help from local authorities.", "title": "Financial scams causing more San Mateo County seniors to seek help - Peninsula Press", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://peninsulapress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/senior_scam_stopper.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-10-30T18:00:22+00:00", "url": "http://peninsulapress.com/2014/10/15/financial-scams-seniors-san-mateo-county/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PeninsuPress", "section": "Crime", "tag": "seniors", "published_time": "2014-10-15T11:25:19+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-30T18:00:22+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Financial scams in San Mateo County are disproportionately affecting senior citizens, leading to a surge in seniors seeking help from local authorities.", "title": "Financial scams causing more San Mateo County seniors to seek help - Peninsula Press", "image": "http://peninsulapress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/senior_scam_stopper.jpg", "creator": "@PeninsuPress", "site": "@PeninsuPress", "card": "summary"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "generator": "WordPress 4.2.4"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf07e\"", "article_summary": "SAN MATEO COUNTY \u2013 Whether they are phony telephone calls from the IRS, home visits from no-good contractors, or fraudulent bank notices, reports of financial scams in San Mateo County disproportionately affecting senior citizens have led to a surge in senior residents seeking help from local authorities.\nYet in San Mateo County, it appears the demand for such information has never been greater.\nMullin hosted two seminars \u2013 called \u201cSenior Scam Stoppers\u201d \u2013 this fall.\nEven though they make up only 14 percent of the San Mateo County population, authorities say senior citizens account for a much higher percentage of scam reports made to law enforcement.\nWhile seniors may tend to report scams more than other age groups, officials said it seems they are often targeted as a demographic."}
