The majority of the United States\u2019 corn and soybean crops are now GE, including a large portion that is used for animal feed.\n\nThe Huffington Post reports that a Senate vote could come as early as next week. The Post also reports that Roberts bill has support from ConAgra, DuPont, Coca-Cola and Walmart. Roberts\u2019 bill is similar to the controversial Safe and Accurate Food Labeling Act, which passed the House in June 2015. To critics, the bill was known as the \u201cDARK\u201d (Deny Americans the Right to Know) Act because the law would have effectively nullified GE labeling measures, such as the bill recently passed in Vermont. The Vermont law is scheduled to take effect July 2016. Senator Roberts\u2019 new bill would prevent the Vermont bill from becoming law. Lawmakers say that a new bill is necessary to avoid a \u201cpatchwork\u201d of laws that vary from state to state. Maine and Connecticut have also passed laws requiring labeling, but those measures will not go into effect until bordering states also pass legislation.\n\n\n\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsor\n\nRoberts bill is not the only legislation aiming to tackle the issue of labeling genetically engineered ingredients in food. An alternative bill was introduced last week by a group of Democrats who are hoping to protect state labeling laws and simultaneously avoid a patchwork of conflicting laws. The bill is supported by Senators Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), Jon Tester (D-Mont.) and Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.). The Democrats\u2019 bill would give food manufacturers four ways to label GMOs on the current nutritional panels.\n\n\u201cThere is a way to give consumers the information they are asking for without placing unfair or conflicting requirements on food producers. This legislation provides the common-sense pathway forward,\u201d Merkley said in a statement.\n\nThe Coalition for Safe Affordable Food, a supporter of Roberts\u2019 bill, said the Democrats\u2019 bill \u201cwould end up stigmatizing a technology the farmers [Merkley] represents rely on\u2026 It can\u2019t pass, period.\u201d The CFSAF also said, \u201cMandatory on-package labeling is reserved for important health and safety information or to distinguish material difference in products. This doesn\u2019t apply to biotech labeling because the overwhelming scientific consensus shows that GMOs are completely safe.\u201d\n\nStill, not all the Senators are impressed or supportive of Roberts\u2019 bill. Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) stated that if bill comes to a vote on the Senate floor without change she will not vote for it. \u201cI will not support a final bill until it includes more transparency and a national uniform standard that works for consumers,\u201d Klobuchar said in statement last week.\n\nThe bill would need 60 votes in the Senate before making its way to President Obama\u2019s desk. It remains unclear whether or not Roberts\u2019 bill will receive as much resistance as the DARK Act did last year. In 2015, the critics of the \u201cDARK Act\u201d were able to force the U.S. Senate Committee on Agriculture Nutrition & Forestry to hold a hearing titled \u201cAgriculture Biotechnology: A Look at Federal Regulation and Stakeholder Perspectives.\u201d\n\nThe committee heard testimony from several speakers representing farmers, the GMO lobby, and consumer groups. Officials from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Food and Drug Administration, and the Environmental Protection Agency also testified. However, the hearing was criticized for being one-sided and favoring corporations who would directly benefit from the passage of the bill.\n\nDerrick Broze is an investigative journalist and liberty activist.
