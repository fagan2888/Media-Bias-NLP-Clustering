Ford switched from steel to aluminum for many key body parts on the F-150 to reduce its weight by up to 700 pounds in a bid to boost gas mileage.\n\nEven though the lighter F-150 has been on sale for months, the Journal also cited a new feature for 2016 that gives it more environmental stature. It's a \"gaseous fuel prep package\" that will allow it to burn natural gas or propane.\n\nStill, it's interesting that a conventional truck beat out three finalists, newer trucks both with diesel engines designed to save fuel: Chevrolet Colorado Duramax and its corporate cousin, GMC Canyon Duramax and the new Nissan Titan XD. Toyota's newTacoma was also a contender.\n\nIn the commercial truck category, the Ram ProMaster City won.\n\n\"The added benefit of higher fuel economy, lower carbon emissions, and greater environmental compatibility offered by the Ford F-150 and Ram ProMaster City mean buyers truly get more than they pay for,\" said Green Car Journal publisher Ron Cogan in a statement.\n\nFollow Chris Woodyard on Twitter at @chriswoodyard\n\nRead or Share this story: http://cjky.it/1jeMXYY", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Ford's durable F-150 pickup has beat out a trio of new diesel-powered models to be named\u00a0Green Truck of the Year.", "og": {"site_name": "The Courier-Journal", "description": "Ford's durable F-150 pickup has beat out a trio of new diesel-powered models to be named\u00a0Green Truck of the Year.", "title": "Ford F-150 pickup named Green Truck of the Year", "url": "http://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/local/2015/11/22/ford-f-150-pickup-named-green-truck-year/76223096/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/courier-journal.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Ford's durable F-150 pickup has beat out a trio of new diesel-powered models to be named\u00a0Green Truck of the Year.", "title": "Ford F-150 pickup named Green Truck of the Year", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/51a7eb2759511930875c86c57814d88204b5a6cb/c=70-0-2078-2008&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/11/21/USATODAY/USATODAY/635837139258974663-FordF150--15.jpg", "creator": "@courierjournal", "site": "@courierjournal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600030236", "fb": {"app_id": 128534137209813}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Places/Canyons", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Places/Canyons", "title": "Ford F-150 pickup named Green Truck of the Year", "author": "Chris Woodyard", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "news/local", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6580b710f62eab6835810624e1ae51d73c4ba826/c=127-0-1633-2008/local/-/media/2015/11/21/USATODAY/USATODAY/635837139258974663-FordF150--15.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/03373b28246d737a6b54e35bef43a2646f5e78a1/c=70-0-2078-2008/local/-/media/2015/11/21/USATODAY/USATODAY/635837139258974663-FordF150--15.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ce52687e89221960a98fc626123cb10f5f65aee4/c=103-0-2774-2008/local/-/media/2015/11/21/USATODAY/USATODAY/635837139258974663-FordF150--15.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f2545e7ae801f70614093895eedde909129ede50/c=0-157-3000-1852&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2015/11/21/USATODAY/USATODAY/635837139258974663-FordF150--15.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-11-22T23:26:09.220000-05:00", "shorthed": "Ford F-150 pickup named Green Truck of the Year", "articleid": 76223096, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2a41ce435dc16474c3ed44ac8f1617cecca33ffa/c=0-157-3000-1852/local/-/media/2015/11/21/USATODAY/USATODAY/635837139258974663-FordF150--15.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2634d69673bdf5b2bf88c0c80aa99a60fa565cc9/c=705-0-1829-2008/local/-/media/2015/11/21/USATODAY/USATODAY/635837139258974663-FordF150--15.jpg"}}, "news_keywords": "Ford, F-150, Green Truck of the Year"}, "article_summary": "Ford's F-150 benefits from up to 700 pounds of weight savings over the previous generation and it was named Green Truck of the Year (Photo: Ford)LOS ANGELES -- In a surprise, Ford's durable F-150 pickup has beat out a trio of new diesel-powered models to be named Green Truck of the Year.\nThe Green Car Journal , which hands out the award, cited efforts to lighten the F-150 as the chief reason for its being named to the award.\nThe announcement was made Friday at the San Antonio Auto Truck Show in Texas a few hours after the Chevrolet Volt was named Green Car of the Yearat the big Los Angeles Auto Show going on here.\nIn the commercial truck category, the Ram ProMaster City won.\n\"The added benefit of higher fuel economy, lower carbon emissions, and greater environmental compatibility offered by the Ford F-150 and Ram ProMaster City mean buyers truly get more than they pay for,\" said Green Car Journal publisher Ron Cogan in a statement."}
