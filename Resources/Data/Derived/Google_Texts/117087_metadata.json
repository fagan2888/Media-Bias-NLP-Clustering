Jerry Brown took a moment to fondly remember a Jesuit teacher he had at St. Ignatius High School in San Francisco.\n\n\u201cFather Clark taught economics,\u201d said Brown, who referred to a jagged line the instructor drew for the class. \u201cAnd I still remember him going to the blackboard and saying, \u201cYou know what this is? It\u2019s the business cycle.'\u201d\n\nBrown had his own chart, which looked like the Sierra Nevada, with jagged peaks and deep valleys representing the unpredictable boom and bust of California\u2019s capital gains revenue.\n\nHis point: \u201cIt\u2019s a very simple matter. If you don\u2019t remember anything else, just remember everything that goes up comes down.\u201d\n\nHe clearly relishes his role as the Capitol\u2019s Cassandra, warning of impending doom just around the corner.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had 10 recessions since World War II,\u201d Professor Brown said, \u201cbut nobody ever plans for it. So it\u2019s always a surprise \u2014 oh my gosh, the budget\u2019s dropped $40 billion!\u201d\n\nAt least for now, state revenue is running billions ahead of the governor\u2019s own projections. And, to be sure, Brown\u2019s proposed spending plan reflects that.\n\nHis $122.6 billion general fund budget keeps higher education tuition flat, adds billions for K-12 education and drops another $2 billion into the voter-approved rainy day fund.\n\nBrown also offers a fix for a state tax on managed care organizations (MCO) that\u2019s set to expire July 1. That expiration would leave a $1.1 billion gap (state and matching federal funds) in the budget unless it\u2019s fixed.\n\nThe governor has been working with insurers to develop a compromise plan they can live with. The MCO tax will provide more funds for Medi-Cal recipients, which, thanks to the Affordable Care Act, now number more than 13 million Californians.\n\nAnd he linked passage of that tax to something relished by Republicans and Democrats alike: More funding for services to the developmentally disabled.\n\nThe governor\u2019s spending plan already includes $130 million in additional funds for the developmentally disabled, but passage of the MCO could be used to supplement those funds.\n\n\u2018This is not a candy store where you can pick out whatever you want\u2026 There\u2019ll be a tendency just to do everything and I\u2019ll have to straighten it out in the end.\u2019 Gov. Jerry Brown\n\nInitial reaction from Republicans was lukewarm.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bit unconscionable that one would tie the funding for the developmentally disabled community to a tax that has nothing to do with them,\u201d said Assemblywoman Melissa Melendez (R-Lake Elsinore). \u201cI think we can fund that community with the resources we have.\u201d\n\nThe governor called a special session of the Legislature last summer urging lawmakers to deal with the MCO tax before it expired. But there was no action, as Republicans refused to go along with the revenue plan. Brown is offering this plan, which health insurers support, in hopes of solving this dilemma sooner rather than later.\n\nOther highlights in the budget:\n\n$24.6 million to fund 126 state workers tasked with creating the state\u2019s first licensing and operating rules for marijuana growers, dispensaries, etc. The money would be spread among several oversight agencies, including Consumer Affairs and Food and Agriculture.\n\n$323 million to address the drought and another $215 million to fight wildfires.\n\nA 10-year transportation proposal to spend $16 billion on highway and roads maintenance.\n\nA new $65 fee on vehicles and changes to gas and diesel taxes to generate $1 billion a year to help pay for highway maintenance. The fee would apply to electric and hybrid vehicles, which pay less in taxes since they use less gasoline than other cars.\n\nA cost-of-living increase for low-income seniors and disabled individuals, the first since 2006.\n\nFor their part, Democrats expressed restrained praise for the governor\u2019s plan. \u201cWhile I appreciate the governor\u2019s continued conservative approach reflected in his budget, we must discuss the needs of Californians still impacted by the deep cuts of the recession,\u201d Sen. Mark Leno (D-San Francisco) said in a written statement.\n\nState Senate President pro Tempore Kevin de Le\u00f3n added, \u201cWe still have to take a closer look at strengthening our health care system for the poor and developmentally disabled that has been starved for far too long.\u201d\n\nToday\u2019s budget is just the first move by a governor who clearly wants his legacy to include fiscal prudence.\n\n\u201cYou know this is not a candy store where you can pick out whatever you want,\u201d Brown said. \u201cBut there\u2019ll be a tendency just to do everything and I\u2019ll have to straighten it out in the end.\u201d\n\nFather Clark would be proud.", "article_metadata": {"description": "As he released a new budget Thursday, Gov.
