They moved on, unlike the \u2018real American\u2019 Tea Partiers who are still blubbering over Thad Cochran\u2019s victory.\n\nAs I watched conservatives seethe Wednesday, and Chris McDaniel (so devoted to describing his martyrdom that I think he\u2019s a day or two away from nailing himself to a cross) boil, I came to feel\u2014to a certain point\u2014sympathy. If the situation were reversed, I thought, and a sellout Democrat had defeated a more progressive opponent on the strength of votes from Republicans, I have to confess I wouldn\u2019t like it a bit.\n\nAnd just as I thought about that, I remembered: Wait. This happened. And it was kind of similar. But it was also quite dissimilar, in ways that are telling about how far divorced from reality these Tea Party people are.\n\nI refer the 2006 battle between Joe Lieberman and Ned Lamont. Let\u2019s recall the facts of the case.\n\nLieberman was the incumbent Democratic senator from Connecticut. Beloved by Democrats, mostly, in 2000 as their history-making Jewish veep candidate, Lieberman quickly slithered into swamps from which he could be neither rescued nor redeemed. He backed the Iraq War, of course. But a lot of high-level Democrats did that. Holy Joe backed it and backed it and backed it and backed it. Op-eds in The Wall Street Journal, ever more frequent appearances on Fox News\u2014that kind of thing.\n\nNor was Iraq his only apostasy. Lieberman backed President George W. Bush, Gov. Jeb Bush, and congressional Republicans on the idea of keeping the feeding tube in Terry Schiavo\u2014against her husband\u2019s wishes. This was an issue of luminous intensity at the time, and Lieberman was the most prominent Democrat to join \u201cTeam Life\u201d on behalf of a woman whom nearly every expert described as being in an irrecoverable vegetative state (and who did indeed die 11 days after the tube was removed for the third and final time in March 2005).\n\nLieberman ran for president as a Democrat in 2004. He tanked. He got more and more belligerent about the war, more and more defensive of Bush. (He went the whole magilla and spoke at the 2008 GOP convention.) Disgust at the war in places like Connecticut ran river deep and mountain high. Lieberman\u2019s 2006 reelection campaign approached, and his pollsters and consultants told him he should file his candidacy as an independent too, just in case.\n\nThat was sound advice, because along came Ned Lamont, a wealthy man but in political terms nothing grander than a selectman in Greenwich. And in the Democratic primary that August, Lamont won. Yes, Lieberman said, he\u2019d stay in and run as an independent, but that would make for a three-way race, and independents never win those. Hallelujah! Holy Joe was done!\n\nBut no\u2014the Nutmeg State GOP ran a particularly feckless candidate that year, and Lieberman, if I\u2019m recalling it accurately, got more GOP votes than the actual GOP candidate. And he beat Lamont easily, by 7 percentage points.\n\nSo far, that\u2019s reasonably analogous to the Cochran-McDaniel situation.\n\nBut Thad Cochran is not analogous to Joe Lieberman in any way. Lieberman, as I wrote above, was more pro-war than most Republicans by 2006. For Cochran to be an ideological equivalent to Lieberman\u2026 well, imagine that Cochran had voted for the Affordable Care Act (Obama\u2019s biggest deal, just as Iraq was Bush\u2019s). And then imagine that Cochran had spent the next several years talking about how great the act was, going on Rachel Maddow\u2019s show to praise it, writing pro-Obamacare opinion pieces in the hated New York Times.\n\nFar from doing any of that, of course, Cochran voted against Obamacare and called it socialism just like the rest of them did. He may not be the Tea Partiers\u2019 beau ideal, but the idea that he\u2019s some kind of squish is preposterous.\n\nSo Democrats and liberals had far, far, far more to be pissed off about in Lieberman than the tea-baggers had in Cochran. Not-in-the-same-galaxy close. And yet\u2014and mark this difference well, please\u2014when Lieberman won, what did liberals do?\n\nThere was some rage in the liberal blogosphere, to be sure. But there was also a fair amount of criticism of the general-election campaign Lamont ran, which was not so good, in surprising contrast to his very smart primary campaign. But within a couple of days, most people accepted that Lieberman played by the rules, Republican votes count too, and they moved on. Lamont himself was gracious in concession, although still angry about the war. But even so, he didn\u2019t get much more indignant than this: \u201cWe ignited a spark that\u2019s going to change the direction of our country in Iraq, and change the direction of our country at home.\u201d\n\nHonestly. These Tea Party people are such crybabies. And for people who are so opposed to gay rights, they\u2019re such drama queens. These very people who go around telling the rest of us that they\u2019re the \u201creal\u201d Americans understand and accept nothing about America and its politics. It\u2019s awfully hard to beat an incumbent, and if you run a Tea Party-centric race in an open primary where Democrats can vote, you need to understand that this just might happen. And you just go lick your wounds and learn, instead of preening around, emitting the rhetorical flatulence we\u2019ve been hearing from the likes of Sarah Palin these last few days.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "mtomasky"}, "keywords": "Republican Party, u.s. poli, Tea Party, Thad Cochran", "publicationDate": 201406270945, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/voxbox/michael-tomasky", "news_keywords": "Republican Party, US Politics, Tea Party, Thad Cochran", "pageNum": 1, "title": "You, Chris McDaniel, Are No Ned Lamont", "tags": "entity:organization/republican_party,topic:politics,entity:organization/tea_party,entity:person/thad_cochran", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Beast", "description": "Democrats had their own intraparty upset in 2006, courtesy of Joe Lieberman.
