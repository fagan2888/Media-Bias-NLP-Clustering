The final regulation updates the FUL formula for payment of certain generic drugs, creating incentives for pharmacies to utilize generic drugs because pharmacy costs for these drugs will be regularly updated.\n\nThe final regulation also implements the ACA provision that extended rebates to covered outpatient drugs provided to beneficiaries enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations. In addition, the final rule is designed to ensure that pharmacy reimbursement is aligned with the acquisition cost of drugs and that the states pay an appropriate professional dispensing fee.\n\nCMS said the proposed rule assists federal and state governments in managing drug costs, establishes a framework for implementation of the Medicaid drug rebate program, and revises the reimbursement system for Medicaid programs and pharmacies. CMS estimates the final rule will save federal and state governments $2.7 billion over five years.\n\nVikki Wachino, CMS deputy administrator and director of the Center for Medicaid and Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program Services, said the final rule will \"ultimately improve beneficiary access to prescription drugs.\u201d ACA increased rebates and set limits on federal reimbursements of prescription drug. CMS said the Covered Outpatient Drugs rule ensures ACA reforms will be effectively implemented by providing further detail on how those reimbursements and rebates are calculated.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in the process of thoroughly reviewing and analyzing the rule, but APhA is pleased attention is being focused on addressing these issues,\u201d Jillanne Schulte, JD, APhA Director of Regulatory Affairs, told pharmacist.com. \u201cAPhA is committed to protecting patient access to affordable medications and pharmacists\u2019 services, and we hope this rule will be a step in the right direction.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, Steven Anderson, president and CEO of the National Association of Chain Drug Stores (NACDS), said \u201cThis is the latest chapter in a decade-long saga that has required NACDS and our allies to defend pharmacy patient care against the potentially devastating cuts of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005.\"\n\nThe final rule will be published in the Federal Register on February 1, 2016, with a 60-day public comment period on two aspects of the final rule.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "American Pharmacists Association", "description": "On January 21, CMS announced a", "title": "CMS issues final rule on Medicaid reimbursement for prescription drugs", "url": "http://www.pharmacist.com/cms-issues-final-rule-medicaid-reimbursement-prescription-drugs", "image": "/sites/default/files/images/APhA-footer-logo.png", "updated_time": "2016-02-02T13:54:00-05:00", "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-26T10:22:31-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-02T13:54:00-05:00"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "On January 21, CMS announced a", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd201d\"", "article_summary": "The final rule will be published in the Federal Register on February 1, 2016, with a 60-day public comment period on two aspects of the final rule.\nOn January 21, CMS announced a final rule with comment period, implementing provisions of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) to change Medicaid drug reimbursement, effective April 1, 2016.\nCMS estimates the final rule will save federal and state governments $2.7 billion over five years.\nIn addition, the final rule is designed to ensure that pharmacy reimbursement is aligned with the acquisition cost of drugs and that the states pay an appropriate professional dispensing fee.\nCMS said the Covered Outpatient Drugs rule ensures ACA reforms will be effectively implemented by providing further detail on how those reimbursements and rebates are calculated."}
