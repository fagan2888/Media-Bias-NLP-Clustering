As the law has gone from one disaster to another, Obama has flailed a little. He\u2019s said \u201csorry\u201d \u2014 sort of \u2014 and he\u2019s allowed that things aren\u2019t optimal, but he hasn\u2019t been prepared to concede that there might be anything wrong with his management style or that this mess is ultimately owned by him. It seems that our progressive president is prepared to defend the many virtues of government right up to the point at which doing so requires admitting that he\u2019s not very good at running things.\n\nIn his Chris Matthew interview yesterday, Obama pushed back against the idea that this was his fault. Per Politico:\n\n\u201cThe challenge, I think, that we have going forward is not so much my personal management style or particular issues around White House organization,\u201d Obama said. \u201cIt actually has to do with what I referred to earlier, which is we have these big agencies, some of which are outdated, some of which are not designed properly.\u201d\n\nSo, it\u2019s the government\u2019s fault, not Obama\u2019s. It\u2019s the design of the agencies, not Obama. Okay, fair enough. But then why isn\u2019t he moving to reform those agencies? He\u2019d certainly have Republican support for that, and, as we all know, he just wants to do \u201cwhat works\u201d and he\u2019ll \u201cwork with anyone\u201d who agrees with him.\n\nThis approach is eerily reminiscent of David Axelrod\u2019s. \u201cHow could the head of the executive branch know about the IRS scandal?\u201d Axelrod effectively asked:\n\n\u201cPart of being president is there\u2019s so much underneath you because the government is so vast. You go through these [controversies] all because of this stuff that is impossible to know if you\u2019re the president or working in the White House, and yet you\u2019re responsible for it and it\u2019s a difficult situation.\u201d\n\nIt is difficult, yes. The federal government has become vast and unwieldy. Which makes it all the more peculiar that the reaction of the administration to every problem is to grow the system that they simultaneously say is too big to manage.\n\nAs it happens, the president appears to know full well that the public sector doesn\u2019t do things very well. He told Chuck Todd in November:\n\nYou know, one of the lessons \u2014 learned from this whole process on the website \u2014 is that probably the biggest gap between the private sector and the federal government is when it comes to I.T. .. Well, the reason is is that when it comes to my campaign, I\u2019m not constrained by a bunch of federal procurement rules, right?\n\nSo, again, why design your central achievement around a website and boast about how amazing it is going to be?\n\nPerhaps my favorite excuse for Obamacare, however, is that none of this would have happened if the much more efficient states hadn\u2019t forced the obviously incompetent federal government to get involved.
