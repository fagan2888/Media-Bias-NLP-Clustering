Tax day 2015 is a long way off, but some accountants are already concerned that problems at Cover Oregon may delay the release of a key new tax form.

The IRS just released a new version of next year’s tax form.

The new 1095-A is required for states, like Oregon, that set up their own exchanges under the Affordable Care Act.

If you’ve enrolled through Cover Oregon, the 1095-A will tell you how big a tax credit you received. That’s important because it allows you to reconcile how much you actually earned with how much you thought you’d earn when you first signed up for coverage.

But George Brandes with the tax service Jackson Hewitt is concerned Cover Oregon’s problems might gum up the works.

“We have real concerns over the state’s ability to issue 1095-A If the response is, well, we’re becoming a federal marketplace. I’m not sure that the federal market place has the ability to do that,” he said. “So this is something that could be a big issue.”

A statement from Cover Oregon simply said the agency is aware of the requirement.
