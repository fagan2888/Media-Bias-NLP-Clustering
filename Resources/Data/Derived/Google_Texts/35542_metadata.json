With this case behind us, we\u2019re going to keep working to make health care in America even better and more affordable, and to get more people covered.\u201d\n\nThe court ruled 6-3 on Thursday to uphold subsidies provided through state health exchanges to people who qualify. Several Republican presidential candidates, and GOP lawmakers, still say they will try to repeal and replace the law.\n\nMr. Obama said the law\u2019s benefits are clear.\n\n\u201cThe law has helped hold the price of health care to its slowest growth in 50 years,\u201d he said. \u201cThis law is working exactly as it\u2019s supposed to \u2014 and in some ways, better than we expected it to. So far more than 16 million uninsured Americans have gained coverage.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cThis is not some abstract political debate. For all the misinformation campaigns, and doomsday predictions; for all the talk of death panels and job destruction; for all the repeal attempts \u2014 this law is helping tens of millions of Americans. This isn\u2019t just about Obamacare. This is health care in America.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Fresh from a victory at the Supreme Court over his signature health-care law, President Obama said it's time for opponents to stop attacking the settled policy.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Fresh from a victory at the Supreme Court over his signature health-care law, President Obama said it\u2019s time for opponents to stop attacking the settled policy.", "title": "Obama says it\u2019s time to \u2018move on\u2019 with Obamacare", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jun/27/obama-says-its-time-move-obamacare/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/03/25/aa6cd8098810c70d710f6a7067001f50.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/03/25/aa6cd8098810c70d710f6a7067001f50.jpg", "description": "Fresh from a victory at the Supreme Court over his signature health-care law, President Obama said it's time for opponents to stop attacking the settled policy.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Obama says it\u2019s time to \u2018move on\u2019 with Obamacare"}, "Author": "Dave Boyer", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Social Issues, Health Medical Pharma, Politics"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc024\"", "article_summary": "Fresh from a victory at the Supreme Court over his signature health-care law, President Obama said it\u2019s time for opponents to stop attacking the settled policy.\n\u201cThe law has helped hold the price of health care to its slowest growth in 50 years,\u201d he said.\nThis is health care in America.\u201d\n\u201cIt is time to stop refighting battles that have been settled again and again,\u201d the president said in his weekly address.\n\u201cThis law is working exactly as it\u2019s supposed to \u2014 and in some ways, better than we expected it to."}
