With about 100 filed amendments awaiting debate, many had already started writing the obituaries for the legislation that would require public colleges and universities to allow concealed handgun license holders to bring guns on campus.\n\nInstead, Speaker Joe Straus called for a vote on SB 11, which passed on a 101-47 vote.\n\nAlso passed before the Senate bill deadline was SB 19, the far-reaching ethics legislation substantially expanded by the House; SB 206, the sunset bill on the Department of Family and Protective Services; and SB 9, a statutory spending limit proposal that was substantially modified by the House.\n\nKilled by the deadline was a hot-button abortion bill. SB 575 would prevent health plans sold on the federal health insurance exchange from offering abortion services. It was perhaps the highest-profile target of the Democrats' delaying tactics that occurred off and on throughout the day.\n\nOn the campus carry bill, it emerged after the House adjourned that a deal had been struck to allow a vote on the bill in exchange for an amendment giving colleges and universities more control over implementation. That includes the ability to pass bans in limited areas of campus. Also, an exception for health-related facilities was written into the bill.\n\nSB 11 faces another vote on final reading today, and it remains to be seen how the House and Senate will reconcile their differences in conference committee between now and sine die on Monday.\n\nTrib Must-Reads\n\nFunding Cut as Film, Video Game Lobbies Squabble, by Ryan McCrimmon \u2014 The incentive fund for attracting film and video game companies to Texas is about to take a major budget hit.
