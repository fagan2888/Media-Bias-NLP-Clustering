Both McConnell and Murkowski pledged that the bill would be open for amendments and acknowledged the fear that senators could bring unrelated ones that could sink the bill. Their hope is that most senators would prefer \u201cregular order\u201d instead of tactics that limit rank-and-file members\u2019 influence. Many senators, including some Democrats, grew frustrated with Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid for limiting the amendment process to protect vulnerable members of his party during the midterm cycle.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen we say it\u2019s open for amendments, it\u2019s open for amendments,\u201d said Murkowski. \u201cSanta Claus is going to be keeping me awake, not worrying about what\u2019s going to come.\u201d\n\nAuthorizing the Keystone XL pipeline has been a dream for senators from the Great Plains to the Gulf of Mexico. In her failed reelection bid, Louisiana Democratic Senator Mary Landrieu fell one vote short of rallying enough of her fellow Democrats to pass the bill a few weeks ago.\n\nThe 1,179-mile pipeline has been blocked for years despite a State Department report concluding that it would not have a significant effect on greenhouse gas emissions. But study also found that it would create a small number of permanent jobs\u2014around 50\u2014and was published before a dramatic drop in oil and gas prices that could boost environmentalists\u2019 opposition of the pipeline. The Keystone pipeline\u2019s fate could also be taken out of Congress\u2019 hands entirely, depending on a Nebraska court case that could alter its path down the heart of the country.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Mitch McConnell said that the first priority for the new Republican-controlled Senate would be to authorize the Keystone XL pipeline.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "It'll set up a confrontation with President Obama.", "title": "Here's the Next Congress' First Order of Business", "url": "http://time.com/3636518/congress-keystone-pipeline-mcconnell/", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/ap696875135561.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/ap696875135561.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012"}, "description": "It'll set up a confrontation with President Obama.", "site": "TIME", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Here's the Next Congress' First Order of Business"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "keywords": "mitch mcconnell, keystone pipeline, energy, oil", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/time"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Mitch McConnell, Keystone Pipeline, energy, oil"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb78f\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWhen we say it\u2019s open for amendments, it\u2019s open for amendments,\u201d said Murkowski.\nAlaska Senator Lisa Murkowski, a top Republican on the Energy Committee, said that the bipartisan measure was important as it would \u201cbasically set the table\u201d for the new Congress.\nTheir hope is that most senators would prefer \u201cregular order\u201d instead of tactics that limit rank-and-file members\u2019 influence.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be starting next year with a job-creating bill that enjoys significant bipartisan support,\u201d said McConnell.\n\u201cSanta Claus is going to be keeping me awake, not worrying about what\u2019s going to come.\u201dAuthorizing the Keystone XL pipeline has been a dream for senators from the Great Plains to the Gulf of Mexico."}
