Would Ben Carson, the 2016 Republican presidential candidate known for his controversial comments consider Donald Trump as his running mate, another man known for his controversial comments?

“Absolutely,” Carson said in an interview with Neil Cavuto on Fox News.

Considering Trump’s stance on immigration and Carson’s stance on gay marriage, such a ticket could provide the ultimate anti-immigration/anti-gay marriage GOP ticket.

Although there’s only one problem. Based on recent polls, it could be the other way around, with Carson being Trump’s No. 2.

But we’re a long way from anything being decided, so let’s just stick with the hypothetical presented to Carson.

It all started when Cavuto asked Carson if he’d consider Trump as his vice president.

“I have had a chance to associate with (Trump) now that I have moved down to Florida,” Carson said. “He’s a very smart guy, and he is a fun guy. So, I will leave it at that.”

But when pressed on the issue, Carson didn’t leave it at that.

“All things are possible,” Carson said. “Absolutely.”

During the interview, he also stressed that “we need to discuss things openly” and he likes “people who are willing to say what they believe.”
