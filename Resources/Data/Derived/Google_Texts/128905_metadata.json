This completely pushes aside the fact that no one is required to drive a car and thus carry auto crash liability insurance. Asserting that the burden to carry Obamacare is no different than the mandate of auto liability insurance is a lie.\n\nAnother of Gruber\u2019s false claims focuses on the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA), which mandates hospitals to provide emergency medical treatment for anyone without regard for their ability to pay. He insists that the EMTALA causes an appreciable increase in the cost of medical care for everyone else, which is equally bogus. The truth is that emergency room costs for both insured and uninsured Americans represent only about 2% of what is spent on healthcare.\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nMoreover, no evidence can be found that supports Gruber\u2019s allegation that medical bills are the number one reason for individuals having to file for personal bankruptcy protection. In fact, a Department of Justice study found that among those seeking bankruptcy protections, although 54% had no medical insurance, 90% reported debt under $5,000.00\u2013which indicates a lack of medical insurance was not the primary cause for their bankruptcy.\n\nOne of the more disingenuous of Gruber\u2019s claims is that 20,000 people a year die for want of medical insurance.\n\nThis claim was likely based on a 21 year old American Medical Association study that used suspect, estimated mortality rates. A recent study done in Oregon revealed that mortality rates remained relatively constant without regard for whether those studied did or did not have health insurance.\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nYet another of Gruber\u2019s lies holds that the largest group of people without insurance is the \u201cworking poor.\u201d A study found that 17 million uninsured people had incomes exceeding $50,000, and another 8 million made more than $75,000. The uninsured are not the \u201cworking poor\u201d; they are the middle class, upper middle class, and illegal aliens.\n\nGruber also said Obamacare would not increase our health insurance premiums; we could keep our current policy and keep our doctors.\n\nAll of this came from a sniveling little twerp who counseled Barack Obama to lie about Obamacare in order to fool people into accepting it.\n\nGet your free PDF of Coach\u2019s book \u201cCrooks Thugs & Bigots: the lost, hidden and changed history of the Democrat Party.\u201d If you don\u2019t know the truth, all you\u2019ll have are Democrat lies.
