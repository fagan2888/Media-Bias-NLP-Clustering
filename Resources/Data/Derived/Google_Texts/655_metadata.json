Scott Walker (R) on Thursday called on the state legislature to repeal the state\u2019s Common Core education standards, national guidelines that are proving to be increasingly controversial in many states. Walker said he wants Common Core to be replaced \u201cwith standards set by people in Wisconsin.\u201d\n\nThe following statements from education policy experts at The Heartland Institute \u2013 a free-market think tank \u2013 may be used for attribution.

Walker towards giving some attention to Common Core. He had previously stated opposition to Common Core, but his Common Core solution included putting its chief proponent in charge of replacing it.\n\n\u201cIf that remains his best idea, Wisconsin kids are still in for a weak curriculum and another decade of ignoring that monopoly education and the deterioration of the family are root causes of poorly prepared teachers, academic-lite curriculum, a culture that shirks the hard work and personal responsibility required for high achievement, and an attenuating citizenry.\u201d\n\nJoy Pullmann\n\nResearch Fellow, The Heartland Institute\n\nManaging Editor, School Reform News\n\n\u201cNow that the rank awfulness of the Common Core standards is finally becoming known, states are starting to back out. That is democracy in action, whereas the initial imposition of Common Core was a top-down, command-and-control approach done through a smoke-and-mirrors sleight of hand intended to look like private, state-led action. The fact that states are leaving the program proves that Common Core never was state-led and always was a big-government scam.\u201d\n\nS.T.
