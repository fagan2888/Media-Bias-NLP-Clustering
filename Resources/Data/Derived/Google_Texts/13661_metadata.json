The billion dollar budget hole still isn't fixed. And there are plenty of other issues still on the table.\n\nA special session is still on the table. But if lawmakers want to be done this week, they have a lot of work in a short amount of time.\n\nThe most glaring issue -- that $1.3 billion budget shortfall and finalizing the state budget for the next fiscal year, Right now not many solutions have really been discussed.\n\nThe $1.50 cigarette tax and accepting federal funds from Obamacare are still being debated. But also two bills are still on the table that have sparked some controversy.\n\nFirst the bill that would allow anyone over 21 and who is not a felon to carry a gun. No permit required. That has passed the House and the Senate, but sits in committee.\n\nAlso, modernizing beer and wine sales. This would allow grocery and convenience stores to sell high point beer. If passed in the House it would then have to be voted on in November because it is a constitutional amendment.\n\nAlso on the agenda, capitol repairs. A $125 million bond issue to fix the building has passed the House but is waiting to be heard in the Senate.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "Monday begins the final week for the 2016 legislative session.\u00a0The billion dollar budget hole still isn't fixed.\u00a0And there are plenty of other issues still on the table.", "author": "Justin Dougherty", "og": {"url": "http://www.news9.com/story/32039689/budget-issue-not-fixed-as-ok-lawmakers-enter-last-week-of-legislative-session", "image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/10617028_G.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Monday begins the final week for the 2016 legislative session.\u00a0The billion dollar budget hole still isn't fixed.\u00a0And there are plenty of other issues still on the table.", "title": "Budget Issue Not Fixed As OK Lawmakers Enter Last Week Of Legislative Session"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/10617028_G.jpg", "description": "Monday begins the final week for the 2016 legislative session.\u00a0The billion dollar budget hole still isn't fixed.\u00a0And there are plenty of other issues still on the table.", "card": "summary", "title": "Budget Issue Not Fixed As OK Lawmakers Enter Last Week Of Legislative Session"}, "wnreadableurl": "budget-issue-not-fixed-as-ok-lawmakers-enter-last-week-of-legislative-session", "ROBOTS": "index,follow,noarchive", "date": "2016/05/23", "fb": {"app_id": 538140636230283}, "owner": "KWTV", "KEYWORDS": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado, budget, hole, shortfall, issue, lawmakers, legislative session, news 9, kwtv, news9.com", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS24", "verify-v1": "d5ZN+GNiazjgWlnr3WHikwraMvFljdUSLMgex4CGnc8=", "news_keywords": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado, budget, hole, shortfall, issue, lawmakers, legislative session, news 9, kwtv, news9.com"}, "article_summary": "The most glaring issue -- that $1.3 billion budget shortfall and finalizing the state budget for the next fiscal year, Right now not many solutions have really been discussed.\nA $125 million bond issue to fix the building has passed the House but is waiting to be heard in the Senate.\nThe billion dollar budget hole still isn't fixed.\nBut if lawmakers want to be done this week, they have a lot of work in a short amount of time.\nIf passed in the House it would then have to be voted on in November because it is a constitutional amendment."}
