(AP Photo/David Goldman)\n\nBy Isadora Rangel of TCPalm\n\nTreasure Coast political donors are overwhelmingly backing former Republican Gov. Jeb Bush\u2019s presidential bid thanks mostly to big checks from wealthy Vero Beach residents.\n\nThe nine donors who wrote checks for at least $25,000 made up almost 80 percent of Treasure Coast donations to at least 14 Democratic and Republican presidential candidates and major PACs that support them, according to a Treasure Coast Newspapers analysis. All but one of those checks came from Vero Beach and supported Bush.\n\nOverall, of the donated $1.2 million by people who listed a Treasure Coast address, 75 percent went to Bush\u2019s campaign and the Right to Rise PAC created to support him. Contributions in support of Democrats Hillary Clinton, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley made up just above 2 percent of the tri-county region\u2019s total.\n\nFLORIDA TIES\n\nBush, whose grandmother lived on Jupiter Island and whose father visited the area several times during his presidency, attended an April 13 event with about 25 supporters at a Vero Beach home, according to his biggest donor, William Becker.\n\nBecker, CEO of Vero Beach-based Peace River Citrus Products, and his wife gave $355,400 to Right to Rise and Bush's campaign, making them the top contributors on the Treasure Coast. Becker said he has been friends with Bush, donating to him since he ran unsuccessfully for governor in 1994, and the two exchange emails periodically. Becker said he expects Bush to attend another fundraiser in Vero Beach before next year\u2019s primary.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always been very impressed with (Bush\u2019s) integrity and intellect,\u201d Becker said. \u201cHe is an extraordinary man. I love his sense humor.\u201d\n\nBush\u2019s protege and only Florida elected official in the race, one-term Sen. Marco Rubio, ranked fourth among Treasure Coast donors, mostly with small donations of up to $5,000.\n\nAndy Taylor, CFO at Peace River Citrus Products, and his wife gave $5,400 to Bush\u2019s campaign. Taylor said Bush\u2019s eight years as Florida governor make him more qualified to hold the presidency than Rubio, who made an unannounced Vero Beach stop in February for a private forum.\n\n\u201cMr. Rubio is a fine senator,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cBut now is time for Gov. Bush.\u201d\n\nCandidate Total raised Treasure Coast donations Jeb Bush (R) $114.6 million $912,250 Chris Christie (R) $14.3 million $110,304 Ted Cruz (R) $52.8 million $51,646 Marco Rubio (R) $25.1 million $48,300 Ben Carson (R) $17.3 million $42,382 Hillary Clinton (D) $63.1 million $24,617 George Pataki (R) $1.1 million $13,000 Rand Paul (R) $12.6 million $10,021 Bernie Sanders (D) $13.7 million $6,590 Martin O\u2019Malley (D) 2.3 million $2,700 Rick Santorum (R) $608,015 $2,000 Lindsey Graham (R) $3.9 million $1,650 Mike Huckabee (R) $9.4 million $500 Carly Fiorina (R) $5.1 million $500 Donald Trump (R) $96,298 $0 Scott Walker (R) $20 million $0 Rick Perry (R) $13.8 million $0 Bobby Jindal (R) $4.2 million $0\n\nFREE COUNTRY\n\nBush wasn\u2019t the only Republican to benefit from big local donors.\n\nA $100,300 contribution by Jupiter Island\u2019s Bruce Kovner to a PAC supporting Chris Christie put the New Jersey governor in second place among Treasure Coast donors. Kovner, who couldn\u2019t be reached for comment, is co-founder of a hedge fund company and is worth $5 billion, according to Forbes Magazine.\n\nChristie is trailed by Texas tea party Sen. Ted Cruz, known for prompting a government shutdown in 2013 in an attempt to defund the Affordable Care Act. Vero Beach resident John W. Childs, the founder of a private equity firm and a major Republican donor, and his wife gave more than 60 percent of the $51,600 Cruz and PACs that support him got from the Treasure Coast. Childs also wrote a $50,000 check to Bush\u2019s PAC.\n\nThe predominance of big Treasure Coast donors reflects a nationwide trend in which millionaires and billionaires are funding increasingly more expensive elections by pouring money into PACs and other outside groups. That trend was set in motion after a 2010 U.S. Supreme Court ruling struck down caps on political contributions to PACs.\n\n\u201cI think if you can afford to give more than average to a candidate you should be entitled to do that,\u201d Becker said. \u201cIt\u2019s a free country and \u2026 you demonstrate that by contributing.\u201d\n\nTOP TREASURE COAST DONORS\n\nResidents who gave at least $25,000 to a candidate or PAC:\n\n$355,400 (Bush): William Becker of Vero Beach, CEO of Peace River Citrus Products, and wife Mary Ann\n\n$250,000 (Bush): Thomas L.
