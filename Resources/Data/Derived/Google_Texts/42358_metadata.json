According to the BBC, an exam initially confirmed several sexual assaults and death due to hanging and three men were arrested in connection with the girls\u2019 deaths.\n\nThe men were released on bail in September and, according to the CBI\u2019s investigation, subsequent forensic tests have since concluded the girls were not sexually assaulted. \u201cBased on around 40 scientific reports the CBI has concluded that the two minor girls in the Badaun case had not been raped and murdered as had been alleged,\u201d CBI spokeswoman Kanchan Prasad told the BBC on Thursday. \u201cInvestigation has concluded that it is a case of suicide.\u201d\n\nWomen\u2019s activists and the families of the girls have voiced their suspicions over the CBI\u2019s findings.\n\n\u201cCBI has tried to fudge the case and save the accused from the very beginning,\u201d Sohan Lal, father of one of the girls, told the BBC. \u201cI am very angry with their decision. The team did not show any promptness while investigating the case.\u201d\n\nMORE: Photos of The Indian Village Shocked By Brutal Rape and Murder Case\n\n[BBC]", "article_metadata": {"description": "An official investigation into the gang-rape and murder of two girls in India in May rules that the two girls committed suicide", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "An official investigation into the gang-rape and murder of two girls in India in May rules that the victims actually committed suicide", "title": "Indian Girls Who Were Believed Murdered Took Their Own Lives", "url": "http://time.com/3608806/indian-girls-who-were-believed-murdered-took-their-own-lives/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-logo-og.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-logo-og.png"}, "description": "An official investigation into the gang-rape and murder of two girls in India in May rules that the victims actually committed suicide", "site": "TIME", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Indian Girls Who Were Believed Murdered Took Their Own Lives"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "keywords": "india, feminism, gang rape, murder, suicide, central bureau of investigation", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/time"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "India, Feminism, Gang rape, murder, suicide, Central Bureau of Investigation"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda6c9\"", "article_summary": "Following worldwide outrage over the alleged gang-rape and murder of two girls, aged 14 and 15, in India earlier this year, the country\u2019s Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has now ruled that the girls took their own lives and were not gang-raped and murdered.\n\u201cCBI has tried to fudge the case and save the accused from the very beginning,\u201d Sohan Lal, father of one of the girls, told the BBC.\n\u201cInvestigation has concluded that it is a case of suicide.\u201dWomen\u2019s activists and the families of the girls have voiced their suspicions over the CBI\u2019s findings.\nThe team did not show any promptness while investigating the case.\u201dMORE: Photos of The Indian Village Shocked By Brutal Rape and Murder Case[BBC]\nThe men were released on bail in September and, according to the CBI\u2019s investigation, subsequent forensic tests have since concluded the girls were not sexually assaulted."}
