Lee said that more than 40% of uninsured state residents eligible for subsidies are likely to be Latino.\n\nState officials say they are focused this fall on the estimated 750,000 people who are eligible for Covered California subsidies but have not signed up for coverage.\n\nThat figure does not include 1.4 million uninsured Californians eligible for health insurance under Medi-Cal, the state\u2019s Medicaid program for the poor, or an additional 1.8 million undocumented immigrants who have no health insurance but are ineligible for state or federal programs.\n\nLast year, the state insurance marketplace failed to reach its goal of enrolling 1.7 million residents. Of the 1.3 million current members of Covered California, nine in 10 receive some form of financial assistance. About 200,000 enrollees pay less than $50 each month thanks to subsidies.\n\nInterested in the stories shaping California?

But the state\u2019s program has faced its own problems, among them preparation for pitching the law\u2019s expanded access to healthcare in neighborhoods like those surrounding the site just east of the 710 Freeway where Lee appeared Sunday.\n\nAltaMed Chief Executive Castulo de la Rocha said a shortage of bilingual outreach workers hamstrung efforts to enroll Southern Californians the past two years. This fall, he said, he thinks that problem has been largely solved and that awareness of Covered California has spread among Latinos through Spanish-language media and friends or family members who have already signed up for insurance.\n\n\u201cWord of mouth is the most important,\u201d he said.\n\nEast L.A. resident Olivia Guzman, 42, was among those who showed up at Sunday\u2019s event on Whittier Boulevard, where AltaMed officials had opened two offices to help people enroll for health insurance. Guzman said she had lived in the U.S. for 22 years without health insurance.\n\nAfter finally receiving a green card in June, she said, she was eager to find a health plan for herself and her teenage son.\n\nGuzman, who said she works in a shoe store, said officials at AltaMed told her she might qualify for a plan that cost $87 per month.\n\n\u201cTo be honest, this is the first time I hear about Obamacare,\u201d she said, referring to the law by its common nickname. \u201cIt\u2019s super cheap.\u201d\n\nSeveral elected officials also attended the event, including state Rep. Jimmy Gomez, state Sen. Ed Hernandez and U.S. Reps. Loretta Sanchez and Lucille Roybal-Allard.\n\nALSO\n\n28 deaths from West Nile virus confirmed in California so far in 2015\n\nGet out those fall clothes, L.A.: Temperatures could drop by 20 degrees\n\nSeveral injured when motorist crashes into pedestrians in downtown L.A.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Officials launch bus tour to promote California health insurance exchange", "Description": "The head of California\u2019s health insurance exchange toured Los Angeles by bus Sunday, seeking to publicize the Affordable Care Act\u2019s potential benefits among Southern Californians, many of them Latino, who officials say have failed to take advantage of the law.
