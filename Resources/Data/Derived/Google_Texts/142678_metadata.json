My father was holding a video camera of the nurses pushing me out, holding the babies. And I said, 'Take a picture of the flag at half-mast. That\u2019s for your daddy,'\u201d said Andrea.\n\nIt is the most unfortunate education, teaching three children to remember and honor a father they never knew.\n\n\u201cWell, I think about daddy. And, he\u2019s really cool. Sometimes I pretend that he\u2019s with me. He\u2019s gonna be helping me throughout the years,\u201d said Ariella.\n\nAndrea believes that means continuing to memorialize Steve in a more muted observance, while sticking to the daily routine.\n\nSo on September 11, as thousands of families gather at the World Trade Center Memorial for an annual reading of the victim\u2019s names, this year, the Russin children have decided to go to school.\n\n\u201cWe decided that this year, we\u2019re going to be celebrating Steve\u2019s birthday, which is in June, as opposed to the day of his death which is in September,\u201d said Andrea.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t prepare for this time of year. We live this time of year, everyday of the year. It\u2019s the rest of the world that\u2019s preparing for this time of year,\u201d said Andrea.\n\nIt was that comment that brought us to confront the elephant in the room -- the annual, calculated media encounters 9/11 family members reluctantly endure year after year.\n\nWhen asked what her feelings are on the fact that PIX11, and most other media outlets are talking to her during this time of the year, when ordinarily there would be no other reason to, she responded, \u201cThere was a point when it was bothersome to me. There was a point that there would be a lot of calls, and silly questions. And that time has passed. At this point, it\u2019s important to me, that people remember.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "It\u2019s September 10, a day before what you might easily suspect is the most difficult day on the calendar for Ariella Russin.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "New York's PIX11 / WPIX-TV", "description": "NEW YORK (PIX11) \u2014 It\u2019s September 10, a day before what you might easily suspect is the most difficult day on the calendar for Ariella Russin.
