With Bill Clinton

Former president Bill Clinton with Letterman in one of his several Late Show appearances over the years. During a Sept. 2013 appearance, Letterman tried to get Clinton to admit whether his wife, Hillary Clinton, had decided on a presidential run. Clinton said he didn't know. "Of course you know!" said Dave, finally adding, "If she is running to your knowledge, blink twice." Clinton laughed, stared back, and finally blurted, “I blinked once!”
