(Fiat Chrysler / Flickr)\n\nIn local after local, auto workers are voting down their union\u2019s national deal with Chrysler, aiming to force their bargainers back to the table to do better.\n\nThe four-year pact announced September 15 would include raises and bonuses but maintain the two-tier system, trap people in Tier 2 who had expected to move up, and create even more tiers.\n\n\u201cI feel like the people who hire in at the lower wage deserve the chance to get to where I\u2019m at, to be able to live in a comfortable manner,\u201d said Nancy Collins, a team leader at Kokomo Transmission in Indiana.\n\nWhen she started at Chrysler 20 years ago, she was a single mom supporting three young kids. Today her daughter and son-in-law, with three kids of their own, work at the plant too.\n\nBut \u201chow they make it on $19 an hour I\u2019m not real sure, and that\u2019s with both of them working,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThey live paycheck to paycheck. ... They do the same jobs we do. There\u2019s no reason they should be paid so much less.\u201d\n\nIn her United Auto Workers Local 685\u2014one of the biggest, representing four plants in Indiana\u201478 percent of production workers and 65 percent of skilled trades workers voted no.\n\n\"Bridge to nowhere\"\n\nMost locals to vote so far have decisively rejected the deal, including Locals 7 (Jefferson North Assembly, Detroit), 1264 (Sterling Stamping, Michigan), 1102 (Kokomo Casting, Indiana), 372 (Trenton Engine, Michigan), 1435 (Toledo Machining, Ohio), 1248 (Mopar in Center Line, Michigan), and others.\n\nJust three locals have voted it up: 723 (Dundee Engine, Michigan), 1302 (salaried workers in Kokomo), and 1284 (Chelsea, Michigan).\n\nAn estimated one-third of Chrysler\u2019s workforce still has votes ahead this week, including Warren Truck and Sterling Heights Assembly (Michigan), Toledo Assembly Complex (Ohio), and Belvidere Assembly (Illinois), through September 30.\n\nWorkers are abuzz on Facebook, swapping contract information, local vote tallies, and photos of ballots marked \u201cno\u201d and protest T-shirts.\n\nIn this year\u2019s Big 3 bargaining, UAW officers had pledged to \u201cbridge the gap\u201d between the tiers. But the union\u2019s choice to settle with Chrysler first\u2014when General Motors and Ford are richer targets, with fewer second-tier workers\u2014seemed aimed at lowering members\u2019 expectations.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bridge to nowhere,\u201d said Alex Wassell, a welder repair worker at Warren Stamping near Detroit. \u201cIt looks like they\u2019re not planning on closing that gap, just raising the lowest-tier workers up to this level and then waiting for traditional workers to quit, retire, or die.\u201d\n\nNon-union workers make up 81 percent of the U.S. auto workforce . Tiered contracts are worsening the union jobs that remain. \u201cThis job that built the middle class, now it\u2019s going to build the poor working class,\u201d said Asar Amen-Ra, a 20-year Mopar employee in Center Line, Michigan. Graphic: Sonia Singh.\n\nProfits soar\n\nThe second tier, earning $15.78-$19.28 an hour, now comprises about 45 percent of the company\u2019s workforce.\n\nMeanwhile Tier 1 workers\u2014those hired before 2007\u2014have been frozen at $28 for years. CEO Sergio Marchionne has made no secret of his desire to phase out the top tier altogether.\n\n\u201cThis job that built the middle class, now it\u2019s going to build the poor working class,\u201d said Asar Amen-Ra, a 20-year Mopar employee in Center Line, Michigan.\n\nThe lower tier wasn\u2019t supposed to balloon forever. \u201cWhen we were hired, the company was just starting to turn around,\u201d said Denny Crum, a forklift driver in Toledo who started two years ago.\n\n\u201cWe were told by several people within the union, \u2018These tiers are going away, we\u2019re going to fight to get rid of them. These were just brought in to keep the company afloat when the economy crashed.\u2019\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the automakers have certainly bounced back, even Chrysler. The company\u2019s latest figures, for the second quarter of this year, showed $1.4 billion in profit in North America, a robust profit margin of 7.7 percent. In the same quarter Ford pocketed 11.1 percent and GM 10 percent.\n\nMarchionne himself took home a handsome $72 million last year. Assuming a 40-hour week, that comes to $34,615 an hour.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re all wondering,\u201d Collins said. \u201cThey say they don\u2019t have any more money to offer us. I don\u2019t see how that can be.\u201d\n\nBroken promise\n\nMany members are especially angry that the union and Chrysler abandoned a longstanding promise to move a segment of Tier 2 workers up into Tier 1. The 2009 settlement agreement and 2011 contract summary reiterated that the lower tier would be capped at no more than 25 percent of the workforce as soon as the contract expired in September 2015.\n\nThat means nearly half of Chrysler\u2019s second-tier workers were supposed to move up to $28 this month. They had waited years for this raise.\n\nInstead, under the proposed deal they would be stuck in Tier 2 for good, earning $17-$24 at first, and eventually topping out at $25.35. Workers say union officers\u2019 excuse is that the promise was only in the contract summary prepared by the union, not in the actual contract.\n\n\u201cDoing the same work, side by side with somebody that makes $10 more, is not okay with me,\u201d said Alex Smith, who works for Mopar, Chrysler\u2019s parts distribution unit, in Los Angeles.\n\nIn his plant, one worker printed up T-shirts reading \u201cSolidarity, No More Tiers, Vote No!\u201d Many wore them to work the day before their vote.\n\nManagers \u201csaid it was going to pass anyway and we were wasting our time,\u201d Smith said. But the next day, Local 230 became one of the first to vote the settlement down.\n\nEven if the 25 percent cap had been honored, \u201cthat still leaves a quarter of our workforce being treated as second-class citizens,\u201d Crum said. \u201cI don\u2019t think there should be a Tier 2 at all. There has to be a path for everyone to eventually make the same.\u201d\n\nHidden lowlights\n\nAnother in the first wave of no votes was Local 1248, which represents Mopar\u2019s headquarters facility in Center Line.\n\nMonths ago, members there formed a committee that\u2019s been studying union history and current labor battles, and spreading the word with \u201cold-fashioned, one-on-one organizing,\u201d said Amen-Ra: \u201ceach one teach one.\u201d\n\nAdding insult to injury, someone discovered a provision\u2014buried on page 255 of the 456-page tentative agreement\u2014that would create new subdivisions within Tier 2, with axle workers topping out at $22.35 and Mopar workers at just $22.\n\nThe union\u2019s breezy official \u201ccontract summary\u201d hadn\u2019t mentioned the lower wage scale for Mopar. But members made copies of that page, posting them up in the cafeteria and handing them out at the plant gates.\n\n\u201cBasically we were being deceived,\u201d Amen-Ra said. \u201cPeople were very upset about that.\u201d\n\nAnother buried provision (pages 265-270) would create a still-lower tier of temporary workers. The old contract allows temporary part-timers to replace absent workers only on Mondays, Fridays, weekends, and holidays.\n\nNow temporary workers could be full-time, work any day of the week, and be used in a range of situations besides absences. Current temps would be grandparented into a wage scale of $17-$22. Newly hired temps\u2014an even lower tier\u2014would make just $15.78-$19.28.\n\nMeanwhile Tier 1 workers, who\u2019ve gone a decade without a raise, would only get 3 percent raises in the first and third years of the four-year contract, and 4 percent lump sums the other years. The deal doesn\u2019t restore inflation-based cost-of-living raises for them, or for retirees on pensions.\n\nWorkers in both tiers \u201cfeel betrayed,\u201d said Bill Parker, former president of Local 1700 at Sterling Heights Assembly. \u201cThey were supposed to be trying to eliminate the division between us. This thing makes the division worse, it makes it permanent, and it creates new divisions.\u201d\n\n'Made it worse'\n\nSecond-tier workers from Detroit\u2019s huge Jefferson North Assembly Plant led an impromptu vote-no rally September 23 outside the union\u2019s international headquarters. Photo: Judy Wraight.\n\nAbout 30 people, mostly second-tier workers from Detroit\u2019s huge Jefferson North Assembly Plant, held an impromptu vote-no rally September 23 outside the union\u2019s international headquarters.\n\nBesides the tiers, members were angry that the deal would worsen an already draconian attendance policy. \u201cThat was one of our major complaints, to fix it\u2014and they made it worse somehow,\u201d said Blake Williams, a five-year employee who drives a forklift.\n\nEmployees say the company doesn\u2019t excuse absences or tardies for things outside their control\u2014traffic accidents, construction, weather, a sick child. You have to have a doctor\u2019s note, and even then it\u2019s hit or miss.\n\nFor instance, Chrysler wouldn\u2019t accept Williams\u2019 excuse note from the emergency room when he took his twin babies, both running high fevers, to the hospital.\n\nUnder the old contract, seven occurrences in a year would get you fired. The tentative agreement would separate tardies from absences, but just three in a year would be punished with a one-day layoff; the fourth tardy, a five-day layoff; the fifth tardy, a 30-day layoff; the sixth tardy, firing.\n\nWorkers took it into their own hands to pass the word about the deal\u2019s lowlights. Williams and a few co-workers read the whole contract and spread the details as quickly and widely as they could.\n\nTheir idea wasn\u2019t to push a no vote, just to \u201ctell everything you know, good or bad, so everybody can make an informed decision.\u201d Local 7\u2019s production workers rejected the deal with 66 percent voting no, and skilled trades with 77 percent.\n\nPamela Pate works on the door line. She\u2019s put in 16 years on Chrysler\u2019s assembly lines in three different plants, and moved twice for the company.\n\nOn top of the other problems with the deal, she\u2019s frustrated it doesn\u2019t restore the seniority she and others lost when their previous plant closed. She came to Jefferson North in 2011, making her less senior than the influx of 2010 hires.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got a decent job for now. I\u2019m 44 and I still feel like I\u2019m young and I\u2019m able to do it,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I\u2019ve got another 13 years to go before I retire.\u201d She had hoped one day to bid into a less physically grueling job in the body shop or paint shop. Now that looks impossible.\n\nFew answers\n\nThe contract\u2019s sweeteners are a $3,000 signing bonus for everyone and a profit-sharing formula that\u2019s somewhat more generous for the second tier. But it\u2019s unlikely the profit-sharing payouts would turn out as high as the appealing sums mentioned in the contract summary, Williams pointed out\u2014since those depend on the company hitting \u201calmost unattainable\u201d financial targets.\n\nThe deal does little to alleviate the unpopular Alternative Work Schedule, which has forced members at affected plants onto four-day weeks of 10-hour shifts. Two-thirds work every Saturday, and one-third flip between day and evening shifts every week. Those who regularly work Saturdays would now get time-and-a-quarter pay, but no relief from the grueling schedule.\n\nThe language on health care is vague. Chrysler and the union agreed to create a co-op with Ford and GM to pool employees\u2019 health care expenses, with details to be worked out later, and to weaken benefits if necessary to avoid the Affordable Care Act\u2019s looming Cadillac tax.\n\n\u201cWhy would I vote for something that I have no details on?\u201d Amen-Ra asked.\n\nCollins sat through a four-hour informational meeting in hopes of getting some answers, but left unsatisfied. UAW Vice President Norwood Jewell \u201ckept saying we\u2019ve only been out of bankruptcy for six years,\u201d she said. \u201cI sat there thinking, \u2018But look at the money that Chrysler has made in six years.\u2019\n\n\u201cI got the feeling at times that he [Jewell] was annoyed that we were smart enough to ask some of the questions we were asking. He would just talk in circles.\u201d\n\nAnnounced in conjunction with the contract settlement was a plan to move products around so that all Chrysler\u2019s small cars will be made in Mexico and its trucks and SUVs in the U.S.\n\nFor now, the larger vehicles are more profitable. \u201cBut the risk for the union membership is, what happens if gas prices skyrocket?\u201d Parker said. \u201cWhat happens if environmental issues force a reduction in trucks and SUVs, then where are we going to be?\u201d\n\n'A bigger pie'\n\nMembers of Local 12, representing workers at the Toledo Assembly Complex in Ohio, rallied against the deal outside their informational meeting yesterday.\n\nParker predicts union officers will ramp up the pressure on workers in the remaining locals to vote yes. \u201cI\u2019m quite sure they\u2019ll spend Monday telling my plant that the 200 [a midsize car currently made in Sterling Heights] going to Mexico is a done deal, but whether the truck stays here, that depends how you vote on the contract,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe other argument they\u2019re trying to come up with now is, \u2018If you vote it down, all we\u2019re going to do is go back to the bargaining table and re-divide the pie.'\u201d\n\nInstead, he argues, \u201cthey need to negotiate a bigger pie.\u201d\n\nIf the tentative agreement is rejected, one possible outcome is for the union to put the Chrysler deal on hold while it bargains with Ford and GM.\n\nWhen Ford workers voted down their contract in 2009, it stuck. When Chrysler\u2019s skilled trades workers voted down theirs in 2011, then-UAW President Bob King declared it ratified anyway by lumping together skilled trades and production.\n\n\u201cOur next move is to make sure the leadership knows we are not stopping,\u201d Amen-Ra said. \u201cWe are going to continue to organize and make sure they go back to the table and get a better contract.\u201d\n\nThis post first appeared at Labor Notes.
