Admired or reviled, he is once again a frontman for Egypt, exhorting international audiences to see the heritage of a country where unrest has hit tourism hard.\n\n\u201cEgypt is safe,\u201d Zahi Hawass declared last week at a South African casino complex where schoolchildren roamed an exhibition of replicas of King Tutankhamun\u2019s treasures. Egyptian hotels and antiquities sites are secure, said Hawass, who planned to welcome a tour group of 120 Americans to Egypt at the end of January.\n\nTourism is resurfacing, but it is a hard sell. The uprising that toppled Mubarak, the 2013 military ouster of Islamist President Mohammed Morsi, and sporadic violence have slammed the key Egyptian industry. On Thursday, militants killed 31 security force members in the restive Sinai Peninsula. On Jan. 24, a female activist was shot dead by police during a peaceful rally near Tahrir Square in Cairo, according to witnesses.\n\nThe Egyptian Museum, home to King Tut\u2019s gold mask, lies near Tahrir Square, the epicenter of the 2011 protests. Hawass was then antiquities minister, assuring journalists that Egypt\u2019s heritage was mostly intact despite some looting and damage. A stalwart of the old regime, he soon left his post and was besieged by allegations that he abused his position for personal gain.\n\n\u201cThe devils came out of the sewage. They hurt me a lot,\u201d Hawass said of his detractors in an interview with The Associated Press. He said it took two years to clear his name.\n\nIn his heyday, 67-year-old Hawass was a domineering charlatan to some and, to others, an animated Egyptologist whose antics and ebullience enlivened the staid world of archaeology for a global audience. He once starred in a TV show about his exploits and still wears a wide-brimmed hat, Indiana Jones style, to desert digs.\n\nNow on the lecture circuit, the silver-haired archaeologist was greeted at a Johannesburg airport by a model in mock ancient Egyptian attire, miniskirt included. He told enthralled children he was a \u201cmummy hunter\u201d and gave two rollicking lectures at Silverstar Casino in Krugersdorp, near Johannesburg.\n\n\u201cWhen you discover a mummy, the media will run after you,\u201d Hawass said to laughter while displaying an image of him inspecting a sarcophagus, surrounded by cameras.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Egypt antiquities showman tells the world it\u2019s safe to visit", "title": "Egypt antiquities showman tells the world it\u2019s safe to visit", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Egypt antiquities showman tells the world it\u2019s safe to visit", "title": "Egypt antiquities showman tells the world it\u2019s safe to visit", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/02/01/egypt_antiquities_showman_tells_the_world_its_safe_to_visit/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/02/egypt-the-mummy-hunter.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Egypt antiquities showman tells the world it\u2019s safe to visit", "title": "Egypt antiquities showman tells the world it\u2019s safe to visit", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/02/egypt-the-mummy-hunter.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Christopher Torchia", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "On Jan. 24, a female activist was shot dead by police during a peaceful rally near Tahrir Square in Cairo, according to witnesses.\nThe Egyptian Museum, home to King Tut\u2019s gold mask, lies near Tahrir Square, the epicenter of the 2011 protests.\n\u201cEgypt is safe,\u201d Zahi Hawass declared last week at a South African casino complex where schoolchildren roamed an exhibition of replicas of King Tutankhamun\u2019s treasures.\nEgyptian hotels and antiquities sites are secure, said Hawass, who planned to welcome a tour group of 120 Americans to Egypt at the end of January.\nHawass was then antiquities minister, assuring journalists that Egypt\u2019s heritage was mostly intact despite some looting and damage."}
