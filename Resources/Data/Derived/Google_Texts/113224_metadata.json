Bernie Sanders of Vermont, fresh from the Democratic presidential campaign trail, lectured Enzi on the folly of discussing budget reform without first taking into account the economic plight of the middle class and the dangers of trying to \u201cbalance the budget on the backs of the most vulnerable.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe chairman talks about people\u2019s faith in government diminishing,\u201d Sanders said, \u201cbut let me tell you something: If the United States government under the Republican leadership in the House and Senate does not pay its bills, you ain\u2019t seen nothing yet in terms of people\u2019s faith in government diminishing.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur entire economy could be put at risk,\u201d he added.\n\nDeborah Weinstein, executive director of the Coalition on Human Needs, a social service advocacy network, denounced proposed spending caps and across the board cuts in the Republican-passed fiscal 2016 budget as a \u201cneedless backwards step further slowing the nation\u2019s modest progress in reducing poverty.\u201d\n\nRelated: What a Debt Ceiling Disaster Could Mean to You\n\nAnd Sen. Angus King of Maine, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats, questioned whether any budget reform could be effective enough to overcome the gridlock and poisoned partisan atmosphere on Capitol Hill. \u201cI\u2019m all for reform but, come on,\u201d King said during the hearing. \u201cThe problem is us, it\u2019s not the process.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019d say changing the process would be like rearranging the chairs on the deck of the Titanic, and that\u2019s doing an injustice to the Titanic,\u201d he said. \u201cCongress needs to do its job.\u201d\n\nWhile there were a number of intriguing ideas for overhauling the budget and appropriations process, the current budget crisis and the House GOP leadership vacuum could indeed cause a repeat of the 16-day partial government shutdown in late 2013 or roil the international markets and the U.S. economy.\n\nFor now, the pressure is on outgoing House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) to raise the debt ceiling and craft a deal that either placates right wing conservatives in the House and Senate or attracts enough Democrats to overcome conservative opposition. Boehner and McConnell are attempting to link adoption of new borrowing authority to stiff spending cuts in domestic and entitlement programs or even passage of a balanced budget amendment by the end of the year.\n\nRelated: House GOP Hatches Harebrained Debt Ceiling Fix\n\nBut President Obama and Democratic leaders are insisting on a \u201cclean\u201d debt ceiling authorization bill, with no strings attached. And Treasury Secretary Jack Lew once again warned that a default could come any time after November 3.\n\nThe White House and the Democrats have also rejected out of hand a measure pending in the House that would allow the Treasury to prioritize which obligations to meet once it started running out of cash. In that way, the Treasury would channel available funds to top priorities \u2013 such as paying the country\u2019s major creditors and Social Security beneficiaries\u2014while ignoring other obligations.\n\nThe so-called \u201cDefault Prevention Act\u201d is similar to a GOP plan floated during the administration of Republican President George W. Bush, but was dismissed as unrealistic because the government automatically makes 80 million payments monthly while the flow of tax receipts fluctuates greatly.\n\nDouglas Holtz-Eakin, a Republican economic adviser and a former director of the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office, dismissed the proposal as \u201cpolitical cover but not a solution of any type,\u201d according to The New York Times.\n\nRelated: McConnell\u2019s Last Stand \u2013 He Wants Medicare, Social Security Cuts to Raise Debt Limit\n\nHoltz-Eakin and Michael Peterson, president and CEO of the Peter G. Peterson Foundation, a budget reform and research group, offered a series of proposals for dealing with the nation\u2019s long-term debt. (Former Wall Street financier Pete Peterson, who founded the Peter G. Peterson Foundation, is also owner of The Fiscal Times).\n\n\u201cBy any definition, the fiscal path we are on is unsustainable and dangerous,\u201d Michael Peterson said, while noting that the budget deficit has plummeted from a high of $1.4 trillion during the Great Recession to $440 billion today. \u201cWe need a more effective, forward-looking budget process, because there are severe consequences of our current fiscal path.\u201d\n\nDrawing on proposals from five leading think tanks across an ideological spectrum, Peterson urged Congress to consider a number of ideas, including \u201clooking further into the future\u201d by producing long-term budget forecasts of 25 years instead of the current ten-year budget window. Without that, he said, \u201cthere\u2019s no meaningful discussion of long-term trends, there\u2019s no visible information about long-term effects, and there\u2019s no credit given for long-term improvement.\u201d\n\nHoltz-Eakin complained that Congress continues to pursue a piecemeal approach to overall budgeting without facing up to the need for fundamental reforms of entitlement programs.\n\nRelated: The Debt Ceiling \u2013 What Is It and Why Should We Care?\n\nHis main recommendation is for the federal government to develop binding \u201cfiscal rules\u201d that would take the form of an overall cap on all federal spending \u2013 discretionary and entitlements \u2013 possibly as a percentage of GDP.\n\n\u201cCommitting to a fiscal rule would force the current, disjointed appropriations, mandatory spending and tax decisions to fit coherently within the adopted fiscal rule,\u201d he said. \u201cAccordingly, it would force lawmakers to make tough tradeoffs, especially across categories of spending.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Senate Budget Committee Chair Mike Enzi (R-WY) was hoping for a dispassionate, somewha", "title": "Debt Crisis and Government Shutdown Fears Cloud Talk of Budget Reform", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/10/22/Debt-Crisis-and-Government-Shutdown-Fears-Cloud-Talk-Budget-Reform", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/07102013_Congress_Clouds_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/10/22/Debt-Crisis-and-Government-Shutdown-Fears-Cloud-Talk-Budget-Reform", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/07102013_Congress_Clouds_article.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Senate Budget Committee Chair Mike Enzi (R-WY) was hoping for a dispassionate, somewha", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2df2\"", "article_summary": "Related: House GOP Hatches Harebrained Debt Ceiling FixBut President Obama and Democratic leaders are insisting on a \u201cclean\u201d debt ceiling authorization bill, with no strings attached.\nRelated: The Debt Ceiling \u2013 What Is It and Why Should We Care?\nSenate Budget Committee Chair Mike Enzi (R-WY) was hoping for a dispassionate, somewhat academic look at ways to repair the sorely dysfunctional federal budget process with an eye to addressing the long-term debt and entitlement reform.\nRelated: McConnell\u2019s Last Stand \u2013 He Wants Medicare, Social Security Cuts to Raise Debt LimitHoltz-Eakin and Michael Peterson, president and CEO of the Peter G.
