Jimmy Davis and his pirates - for the hearts and minds of the Peninsula City.\n\nWhen it was his turn to address his backers, and visitors, the mayor, who started in even voice, quickly entered into a crescendo.\n\nHe told everyone that they were not dead (who said that?) and that everyone would \u201cfight right until the end.\u201d\n\nOnce again, the mayor brought up images of a city, a hometown, \u201cfrom Bergen Point to the city line, from the east side to west side.\u201d Then he offered depictions of diverse city residents, including a tale about meeting a young Polish couple who had just arrived in this country, \u201cto create their American dream in Bayonne.\u201d Smith was on a roll and it was as if he hardly took a breath.\n\n\u201cThey understand the promise,\u201d he shouted. \u201cThey understand the promise of America, the promise of tomorrow, the promise and greatness of Bayonne!\u201d It ended with Smith leading a chorus of \u201cfour more years, four more years!\u201d\n\nWith apologies to The Bard, you could almost envision the mayor hoisting a banner with the city seal and urging, \u201cOnce more unto the breach, dear friends, once more \u2026\u201d\n\nBut will they? Is there enough of an urgency in the Smith camp to match the bravado?\n\nThey claim there is a big difference between the first election campaign plan and the new runoff strategy. Last time, they relied heavily on a big campaign war chest buying political literature and video. There was little face-to-face with the public. The word \u201carrogance\u201d was used by many opposed to the administration and those still waiting to see improvements in Bayonne. Now, in a fight for their political lives, Smith his and council members \u2013 minus the 1st Ward that is now Davis territory - are expected to go door-to-door and embrace residents (\"I feel your pain.\").\n\nIt\u2019s time for the personal touch. What do they call it - old school or the Davis method?\n\nThe campaign seems more and more like reality TV. Thursday evening, when they were announcing people in the Chandelier crowd, it was explained that 3rd Ward Councilman Ray Greaves was not present because he knew the importance of the election and was walking door-to-door. So naturally, there were \u201crumors\u201d and high Hudson County Democratic Party sources said that there had been some friction between Smith and Greaves on the evening the May election results were announced. They reported that the councilman, who was about 300 votes behind and received 30 percent of the vote, while ex-Councilman and Davis candidate Gary La Pelusa garnered 38 percent, may have felt Smith cut his votes for fear that Greaves may one day want to be mayor.\n\nReached by phone, Greaves denied any friction exists with the mayor and that he left the Chandelier early because AFL-CIO members arrived ready to walk. The union backing of Greaves and the Smith campaign is a big bonus, although I thought they were there last time. The councilman believes problems arose in his race because his name was hard to find on a ballot that had five others on it but that in the runoff, there will only be two in his ward.\n\nIt is very difficult, not impossible, for an incumbent that was forced into a runoff, to come away with a victory. The Smith camp has come up with many excuses for finding themselves in this position. Much of it has to do with the premise that people did not come out to vote for them \u2013 even though there were some 10,500 votes cast, a good turnout \u2013 because people thought the administration was a shoo-in. People were shocked by the results, it was said at the Chandelier and now they are taking the election serious. Well, serious enough to seek help from Hudson County Democrats and workers from Jersey City (not Mayor Steve Fulop\u2019s minions) and other places.\n\nThe danger is that there is the feeling that Bayonne locals don\u2019t like election intrusions from outsiders, even if nearly half of today\u2019s Peninsula City residents probably have Jersey City roots.\n\nNow here\u2019s the telling moment that may reveal the administration\u2019s urgency of the moment. After the election, I believe it was on May 19, Smith declared an emergency meeting of his troops where he pumped them up with a need to fight to the death before giving up control of City Hall. He was emotional then as well. And here\u2019s the kicker. With the nearly 270 troops all gung ho and ready to take to the streets, Smith says they\u2019ll meet again next week and get to work. Say again.\n\nOf course next week was on Memorial Day Weekend and time to fire up the grill. No one was ready to \u201cThen imitate the action of the tiger.\u201d\n\nTo be fair, it is a short campaign. Can anyone rebuild lost momentum in such a short time?\n\nWhat Smith is learning is that even the most powerful politicians always run for re-election with a real fear of losing.\n\nINSIDER NOTES:\n\n-- The Bayonne Tenant Organization hosted a meet and greet for Davis Wednesday evening. The running joke is that they're planning a Going Away Party for Smith.\n\nThe fear the challenger has is that so many in the city believe the police captain is a sure winner in the runoff that they forget to go to the polls.\n\nCould there be more votes cast in the runoff than there were in the May regular contest? Could be, when you remember that this is Hudson County\n\nDavis held yet another meet and greet last evening at the Zapata Retaurant. He seems to target the stomach. If you recall, he showed up at a senior citizens building (where he is not allowed to enter) with an ice cream truck, drawing out the potential voters. Like money, food is an incentive.\n\n-- Council candidate and college student Daniel Herrera, who ran with defeated mayoral candidate Anthony Zanowic, followed the head of his ticket and endorsed Smith. Herrera is on Facebook and set off a bit of a storm when he wrote: \"The Peninsula City Tribune 'newspaper' is one of the most disgusting, vile, and racist things I have ever seen. I strongly believe that this horrible political attack literature is part of the Davis campaign.\"\n\nWelcome to politics 101, young man.\n\n-- Then there's the letter making the rounds in a Peninsula City weekly that trashes Davis and makes the sans contract local teachers boil.\n\nMake no mistake, I'm looking for a teaching job with the Bayonne Board of Education. If Mayor Mark Smith is re-elected, I might get an 8 percent raise over current rates, whereas if Jimmy Davis heads to City Hall I'm looking at a bump up of 17.9 percent. As a man of considerable cultural attainment I am entitled to a life of leisure and bourgeois comfort. You needn't be as bright as Hans Urs von Balthasar to know how I'm going to vote in the runoff. With a Davis-enhanced salary I'll be able to afford both a cottage in Belmar and a rustic retreat on leafy Greenwood Lake. Does Assemblyman Jason O'Donnell really expect me, with my fair Irish-American complexion, to spend every weekend and personal day under the direct glare of the sun at the Jersey Shore? I need to alternate those getaways with sick days and such in a green and shady grove. Does Jason want to give me skin cancer? And don't carp to me about the $1,100 average increase that Bayonne property taxpayers will have to pony up. The handful of academics clustered around the Smith campaign prattle on about the bonum commune, the common good. How antiquated. They're living in the Middle Ages with Thomas Aquinas. They fail to realize that in postmodernity all their cherished metanarratives have collapsed. We cutting edge thinkers know that the only bonum left standing is the bonum particulare, the individual good. To those cheapskates who would begrudge me my ticket into the fair courts of life, I say count your blessings, think of the poor folk in Africa. And if you can't follow the above philosophical reasoning in Latin, well, go get yourself a Master's Degree, and then come back and talk to me. It may just be that you're one of what socialite Leona Helmsley called \"the little people.\"\n\nAnd did you see where former mayoral candidate Anthony Zanowic endorsed Mayor Mark Smith? Zanowic is a notorious conservative whose middle name is frugality, the opposite of big- government types like former Governor Jim Florio and President Obama. With him whispering into Mayor Smith's ear the bottom could conceivably fall out of local property taxes. How vertiginous would that be? Taxes going down? The last thing I need is to be shelling out my Obamacare deductible to purchase some drug to combat vertigo. As the good nuns used to tell us, \"A word to the wise is sufficient.\"\n\nMERRILL C. JACOBSON\n\nProfessional Educationists for Davis\n\nINSIDER NOTES:\n\n-- We'll get back to the rest of the county next time around. I haven't forgotten about Jersey City Mayor Steve Fulop's shindig this week that attracted a number of important Dems from around the state -- including Hudson County's Robinson Crusoe, better known as Union City Mayor and Sen. Brian Stack, who doesn't realize what a big mess he has walked into and how there will be anything but stability among Hudson's Dems. Gotta take a breath after that sentence. Watch, now I'll get the phone calls.\n\n-- Before I leave for primary night, I have to mention that this week Hudson County Freeholder Bill O'Dea held a meet and greet, with what I guess were about 30-to 50 people. Guess where? The Astor Bar in Jersey City in what must have been a night of nostalgia.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "bayonne, opinion", "title": "Political Insider: Bayonne mayor fighting for 'four more years, four more years'", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Political Insider: Bayonne mayor fighting for \\u0027four more years, four more years\\u0027\", \"link\": \"http://www.nj.com/opinion/index.ssf/2014/06/political_insider_bayonne_mayor_fighting_for_four_more_years_four_more_years.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://image.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/jersey-journal/photo/2014/05/14938220-large.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"13072116\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-06-01T13:36:39Z\", \"author\": \"Agustin C.
