But I\u2019ll bet a few folks coughed up their cornflakes when Scarpino said it might cost upwards of $88 million to complete the job.\n\nWasn\u2019t this the same outfit that burned through $47 million of state money about half a dozen years ago to achieve essentially the same purpose? And now they want almost twice as much? (Scarpino was not CEO at the time.)\n\nAssemblyman Kevin Cahill, who may have gulped at the latest price tag, said these things need to be put in perspective. He believes the original $47 million of state funding, which he helped secure, has been well-spent. \u201cIt kept our hospitals open, kept most of those jobs,\u201d he said, though he\u2019s by no means on board with the latest proposal.\n\nSome $24 million of the initial state grant went to pay down hospital debt, which accrues to the bottom line, which can attract would-be partners, \u201cprobably Westchester,\u201d Cahill said, which is where HealthAlliance seems headed. Equal shares of the remainder were used for capital updates at both hospitals, though committing $17 million to reconfigure an emergency room at one facility only to abandon it (as planned) to build a new one at the other still rankles.\n\n\u201cThe bottom line,\u201d said Cahill, \u201cis that our hospitals are still open and their updated facilities have future use.\u201d\n\nBut Scarpino and crew should not necessarily expect another massive state bailout, the assemblyman said. \u201cIt will take a combination of financing, grants for sure, loans and affiliations, investments on the part of their affiliates, probably, selling or leasing of assets. That\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing, but waiting for a state grant is not a business plan.\u201d\n\nCahill observed that different solutions are called for under different circumstances. \u201cEight years ago, there was no such thing as the Affordable Care Act or managed Medicare,\u201d he said. \u201cThe whole dynamic has changed. Only the greatest visionary would have envisioned this.\u201d\n\nChange was not going to stop. \u201cWhen we\u2019re done,\u201d he predicted, \u201cthere will be only a few major players. Health care will look like Ford, General Motors and Chrysler.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, HealthAlliance needs to convince its stakeholders it\u2019s on the right track, wherever that might lead.\n\nUp the DEP\n\nIt may be entirely fitting and proper that an oft-quasi-military outfit, New York City\u2019s Department of Environmental Protection police, established their training center in the former Army Reserve center on Flatbush Avenue in Kingston.\n\nNamed for World War II Medal of Honor recipient Staff Sgt. Robert H. Dietz of Kingston, the reserve center was declared government surplus when the Army announced plans to build what is now the Sean Farrell Army Reserve center on Old King\u2019s Highway south of Saugerties.\n\nThe feds give public entities first dibs on these properties. The city and the school district had expressed interest. If developers were interested in a well-maintained property with ready railroad access, their inquiries didn\u2019t rise to public disclosure.\n\nIn any event, the facility is a good fit for training future DEP police officers. There was a time not that long ago when those officers were looked upon as a kind of rent-a-cop, especially by motorists snagged in the Bermuda Triangle on Route 28 west where Ulster cops, state troopers, sheriff\u2019s patrols and later DEP cops converged. At least one local town judge refused to honor traffic tickets written by DEP cops, contending they had jurisdiction only on reservoir property. The courts decided otherwise. Others looked on DEP police as an asset, providing another level of police protection at no direct cost to local taxpayers.\n\nIt is in that spirit, then, that the city should welcome the DEP training center, which incidentally will retain the name of hometown hero Robert H. Dietz, killed in action in Germany 70 years ago on March 29.\n\nBeau James\n\nTo borrow a malaprop from a long-gone alderman, when it comes to politics and government, how do you separate the wheat from the shaft?\n\nThat\u2019s essentially the dilemma Ulster Town Supervisor Jim Quigley confronted when he left the private sector to lead town government back from the brink of financial calamity more than five years ago. The fact is, as Quigley has now learned to his considerable chagrin, government and politics can\u2019t be separated. They are intrinsically bound up with each other.\n\nLast week, Quigley announced he was resigning because of \u201cpolitics.\u201d A few hours later, after entreaties from town officials, he changed his mind, blaming \u201cpolitics.\u201d Public reaction was swift and critical. As Quigley may have learned from this recent debacle, if you\u2019re in politics, to some extent you have to play the game.\n\nNot all of this is on Quigley, an intense, committed A-type personality who does not suffer fools or politicians gladly. Quick to grasp the most complex of issues and decisive, he can also be impulsive and arbitrary, as witnessed by last week\u2019s flip-flop.\n\nThat long-simmering resentment over political interference in government was a factor cannot be dismissed. But as Quigley well knows, boss politics has been a longstanding tradition in the Town of Ulster.\n\nYears ago when I broke in, Joe Lohmaier was both town Republican chairman and assessor. So is his successor, Jim Maloney.\n\nLohmaier attended all town board meetings where he would sit in the front row left, and either nod or shake his head on whatever legislation was being considered. The town board would respond accordingly.\n\nIt\u2019s likely Quigley will finish the last six months of his term \u2014 he was at his desk on Monday \u2014 but perhaps not without some parting politics of his own.\n\nQuigley cites the way Maloney and his committee handled the recent appointment of Linda McDonough as town clerk as a reason for resigning, which sounds really petty. He liked even less some of the procedures the new clerk put in place. By the way, that \u201crecommendation\u201d from the town GOP committee was unanimously approved by the town board, including the supervisor. Nonetheless, Quigley may run a candidate of his own for town clerk at the August caucus of the town committee. If so, we will then have a definitive read of where political power rests in Ulster. Boss Quigley? Somewhere Joe Lohmaier is laughing.\n\nTwo strikes\n\nMommas, don\u2019t let your babies grow up to be \u2026 state legislators.\n\nWith this week\u2019s unsurprising federal indictment of Senate Majority Leader Dean Skelos, two of the \u201cthree men in the room\u201d last January are now facing felony bribery charges. Last winter, ex-Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver \u201cdid the right thing\u201d by his caucus and resigned his speakership, but did not leave office. He now occupies a back bench in the Assembly. Skelos, as of this writing, has not made those decisions, and the Senate GOP caucus on Monday night decided to stand by him. Local state Sen. John Bonacic has been one of the first to call on his \u201cfriend\u201d and long-time colleague to resign, but with a caveat, it seems.\n\n\u201cYou never know what [legislators] are doing down in their districts,\u201d Bonacic said, according to published reports. That apparently meant that at least in Bonacic\u2019s judgment the alleged sins of Skelos were home-grown, not Albany based. As Bonacic, a lawyer, no doubt appreciates, such under the law is a difference without a distinction.
