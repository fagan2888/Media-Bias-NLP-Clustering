Life and breath,\u201d said race walker Stanley Grownek of Boulder.\n\nIt is a Memorial Day race so it`s only fitting that the citizen winners were a U.S. Air Force Pilot on the men\u2019s side and a major in the Air Force on the women\u2019s side.\n\nBut thousands of other runners had their very own reasons for competing in Monday`s race.\n\nFor two-time cancer survivor Rosemary Czuba it was about celebrating her father, a veteran. \u201cGo Dad. I know you`re watching me,\u201d she said as she looked up toward the sky.\n\nIt was also about showing off her renewed zest for life. \"I feel energy. It just kept me going. It was just a swell of energy. I loved it,\u201d she said. \u201cAll I can say is that I`m ecstatic. I love life. And if I ever thought I didn`t, I know now I love life. I`m going to flash mob every chance I get,\u201d she said.\n\nFor race walker Karina Olivas, one of the last to walk across that finish line, completing the race was a message to herself and a lesson for others. \u201cI wanted to prove that no matter what I look like, I could do this,\u201d Olivas said.\n\n\u201cPeople look at me and they have a certain idea of what I do but they don`t know that I do things like this and I don`t just sit around on the couch. So this is a huge moment for me,\u201d she said.\n\nBack this year to conclude the 10K, an F-16 flyover by the Naval Strike and Air Warfare Center from NAS Fallon, Nevada.", "article_metadata": {"description": "BOULDER, Colo. -- It's called \"America\u2019s all-time best 10k and it draws thousands every single year.
