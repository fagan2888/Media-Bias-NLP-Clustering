The rest, he said, \"were insulating themselves against sound bites.\"\n\n\"The fact of the matter is, one of our big problems in Washington is that we tend to react to sound bites a little bit too often,\" Clyburn told CNN's Candy Crowley.\n\nThe representative explained that constituents would hear of the bill and believe their representative voted against their right to keep their insurance plan if they didn't support Upton's proposal.\n\n\"I don't blame anybody for insulating themselves from these sound bites because that's the world we live in, unfortunately,\" Clyburn said. \"But that's the world we live in.\"\n\nClyburn also faulted President Barack Obama for relying too heavily on sound bites, saying the \"if you like your health insurance, you can keep it\" selling point needed a more in-depth explanation.\n\n\"One of the things in Washington that I dislike more than anything else is when people say to me, 'If you're explaining it, you're losing it.' I don't like that at all,\" Clyburn said. \"I really believe the American people are deserving of explanations.\"\n\nAlso on HuffPost: Politicians React To Obamacare Rollout Politicians React To Obamacare Rollout\n\n1 of 6 Michele Bachmann \"There\u2019s no sugarcoating it: Obamacare is forcing every American to purchase a health-insurance policy they don\u2019t want at a price they can\u2019t afford from a website that doesn\u2019t work.\" Share this slide:\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "Rep.
