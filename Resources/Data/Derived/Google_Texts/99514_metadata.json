It is the culmination of an insidious trend of self-censorship in the face of intimidation that has plagued Western culture for more than a decade.\n\nNine years ago, as culture editor of the Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten, I commissioned cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad to start a debate about how we talk about Islam. In commissioning the cartoons, my newspaper was reacting to a pattern of self-censorship among publishers, writers, museums, theaters and performers. Institutions like the Tate museum in London and the Museum of World Culture in Gothenburg, Sweden, had called off shows or removed artwork from exhibits. Illustrators in Denmark were even afraid to make drawings for a children\u2019s book on Muhammad.\n\nWe received 12 cartoons and published all of them, including one by the cartoonist Kurt Westergaard showing the prophet with a bomb in his turban. We found out soon enough that fears of violence for ridiculing a religious symbol were not mere fantasy. The ensuing violence was manufactured months after the cartoons were published by activist imams with an agenda (and some falsified cartoons). It is true that embassies were stormed, boycotts proclaimed and some 200 people died around the world \u2014 though all the violence took place in countries without protection of speech. Numerous death threats came our way. The irony was that the perpetrators of these crimes were basically saying: You depicted us as violent, so we are going to kill you.\n\nThe cartoons were not intended to target a group, as critics claim, but to start a debate about how we talk about Islam. Mr. Westergaard\u2019s cartoon depicted Muhammad as one representation of Islam, in the same way that images of Jesus refer to Christianity, Karl Marx to Marxism, and Uncle Sam to the United States.\n\nIn the West, we increasingly live side by side with people who are different from us. A statement made in one part of the world is often heard \u2014 and misheard and misinterpreted \u2014 in many other parts. The Danish cartoons were created in the context of European humor but were soon seen in the cultural crucible of the Islamic Middle East. \u201cThe Interview\u201d was an American comedy that was heard loudest on the other side of the Pacific Ocean \u2014 before it was ever shown. The North Korean government took great umbrage at a film American audiences might have found hilarious. As with the cartoons, the humor did not travel well.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut the decision by several large movie theater chains \u2014 and now Sony \u2014 to bow to bullies hiding behind Internet anonymity is wrongheaded. It is an open-ended invitation to more intimidation. History teaches that if you give in to intimidation once, you will not reduce it in the future; you will get more of it.\n\nUnfortunately it is a growing trend. In Europe nobody publishes cartoons of Muhammad anymore even though there are cartoons of figures and symbols of other religions all over the place. Publishers have made this choice not out of concern for offending a minority, but out of fear.\n\nAfter the Dutch filmmaker Theo van Gogh was killed in 2004 by a young Muslim who thought that Mr. van Gogh had offended God by making a documentary about violence against Muslim women, the Dutch minister of justice suggested that Mr. van Gogh would have still been alive if the Netherlands had had more stringent laws limiting work like Mr. van Gogh\u2019s.\n\nIs it outrageous, even despicable, to depict the death of a national leader, as \u201cThe Interview\u201d did with North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong-un? Maybe. But \u201cDeath of a President,\u201d a 2006 \u201cmockumentary,\u201d depicted the assassination of President George W. Bush on the streets of Chicago. CNN and NPR declined to run ads for the film, Hillary Rodham Clinton (then a senator) criticized it and the Bush White House declined to comment on it. No one in the American mainstream called for censorship (or self-censorship).\n\nWe must preserve what the writer Salman Rushdie has called people\u2019s \u201cright to tell their own story in any way they wish.\u201d The right to live freely, to read anything, to express oneself, trumps the right not to be offended.\n\nHow do we defend that right? We do it with solidarity in the face of intimidation. When Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, issued a 1989 fatwa on Mr. Rushdie because of a few pages in \u201cThe Satanic Verses,\u201d one Danish writer made the ingenious suggestion that his colleagues include the offensive pages from Mr. Rushdie\u2019s novel as a supplement in their next books.\n\nThat seems to me a very effective way to fight intimidation and self-censorship. It may be easy for a state or a movement to go after one writer and his publishers and translators. But it\u2019s virtually impossible to go after thousands of them. As I learned during my 14 years as a correspondent in the Soviet Union, a dictatorship dissolves quickly when fear among its citizens dissipates. Dictatorships exist on the premise that people internalize the limits that the authorities impose on society.\n\nThe best way to counter the damage created by Sony\u2019s surrender to the intimidators would be for all of Hollywood to unite and for every studio to make a movie with a plot similar to that of \u201cThe Interview.\u201d They could humorously kill off all manner of repugnant leaders \u2014 not merely Kim Jong-un. Such an act would be a defiant affirmation of cultural freedom and the right to produce even offensive humor. At the very least, Sony should put \u201cThe Interview\u201d online free.\n\nSadly, Hollywood\u2019s only significant reaction, so far, is Paramount\u2019s decision to prohibit three movie theaters from screening, as a political statement, \u201cTeam America: World Police\u201d (a 2004 film that features Kim Jong-un\u2019s father, Kim Jong-il, as a singing marionette). This is another step in the self-imposed tyranny of silence, a society where a new fundamentalism of grievance will determine what can and cannot be said.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "opinion", "ptime": 20141219195856, "twitter": {"description": "History teaches that if you give in to intimidation once, you will not reduce it in the future; you will get more of it.", "title": "Sony Caved to Terror.
