The farms will showcase conservation practices aimed at reducing and preventing nutrient run-off and improving water quality in Lake Erie.\n\nThe Natural Resources Conservation Service will provide financial assistance to the farmers through conservation program contracts.\n\nThe agency said the three farms were selected to \u201creflect the makeup of agriculture in the watershed regarding crops and livestock, soil types, farm sizes, topography and current farming practices.\n\nConservation systems will be installed at the farms to monitor input and output, including annual fertilizer application rates and fertilizer levels.\n\nProject manager Aaron Heilers said that one of the project\u2019s primary goals is to determine which practices have the most positive environmental benefits with the least amount of economic impact on the farmers, and then share those technologies with other farmers.\n\n\u201cThe agriculture community cares about water quality and this is our opportunity to showcase the things that we\u2019re doing,\u201d Heilers said.\n\nHeilers said multiple field days will be held throughout the next five years. The first is scheduled for Aug. 26.\n\nLake Erie continues to be plagued by algae blooms that produce the kind of toxins that contaminated Toledo\u2019s water supply in 2014. Last summer\u2019s bloom across the lake was the largest on record.\n\nAlgae blooms- linked to phosphorus from farm fertilizers, livestock manure and sewage treatment plants -have been blamed for fouling drinking water and contributing to oxygen-deprived dead zones where fish can\u2019t survive.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Three farms in northwestern Ohio are being turned into demonstration sites to show farmers how to reduce fertilizer runoff that feeds the harmful algae in Lake Erie.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/apr/23/3-northwest-ohio-farms-to-showcase-conservation-pr/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "Three farms in northwestern Ohio are being turned into demonstration sites to show farmers how to reduce fertilizer runoff that feeds the harmful algae in Lake Erie.", "title": "3 northwest Ohio farms to showcase conservation practices"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "description": "Three farms in northwestern Ohio are being turned into demonstration sites to show farmers how to reduce fertilizer runoff that feeds the harmful algae in Lake Erie.", "card": "summary", "title": "3 northwest Ohio farms to showcase conservation practices"}, "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "The farms will showcase conservation practices aimed at reducing and preventing nutrient run-off and improving water quality in Lake Erie.\nThe Ohio Farm Bureau Federation and the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s Natural Resources Conservation Service this week announced the launch of The Blanchard River Demonstration Farms Network.\nThe Natural Resources Conservation Service will provide financial assistance to the farmers through conservation program contracts.\nThe network involves Stateler Family Farms in McComb, Kurt Farm in Dunkirk and Kellogg Farms in Forest.\nConservation systems will be installed at the farms to monitor input and output, including annual fertilizer application rates and fertilizer levels."}
