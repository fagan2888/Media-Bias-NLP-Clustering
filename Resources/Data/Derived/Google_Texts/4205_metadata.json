One example is the so-called \u201cheartbleed\u201d bug discovered earlier this year that made large amounts of online data, including passwords, vulnerable to hackers. The flaw sent many major Internet companies scrambling to secure their networks.\n\nGoogle has also beefed up its encryption system to protect its network, including its Gmail service, after a massive secret government data-gathering program under the National Security System was exposed by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden.\n\nThe Google team will take on threats even beyond Google products and will work with other software vendors in identifying and fixing network flaws.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not placing any particular bounds on this project and will work to improve the security of any software depended upon by large numbers of people, paying careful attention to the techniques, targets and motivations of attackers,\u201d said Evans, who also helped set up the Google Chrome security team.\n\n\u201cOur objective is to significantly reduce the number of people harmed by targeted attacks,\u201d he added. \u201cWe\u2019re hiring the best practically-minded security researchers and contributing 100% of their time toward improving security across the Internet.\u201d\n\nMore must-read stories from MarketWatch:\n\nGoogle Glass pioneer joins Amazon\n\nYahoo earnings: Focus on Alibaba, display business\n\nMore from MarketWatch", "article_metadata": {"lifp_basePath": "https://id.marketwatch.com/access", "twitter": {"domain": "marketwatch.com", "description": "Google has created a team, dubbed Project Zero, to hunt Web threats and hackers.", "creator": "@benpimentel", "image": {"width": 569, "identifier": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-BF580_google_MG_20130717132632.jpg", "height": 398}, "site": {"id": 624413}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "parsely-author": "Benjamin Pimentel", "article.content_group": "marketwatch", "article.section": "Markets", "parsely-type": "post", "description": "Google has created a team, dubbed Project Zero, to hunt Web threats and hackers.", "parsely-link": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/google-team-to-hunt-web-threats-hackers-2014-07-15", "author": "Benjamin Pimentel", "parsely-title": "Google team to hunt Web threats, hackers", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=336693422", "parsely-pub-date": "2014-07-15T11:09:00-04:00", "page.site": "marketwatch", "robots": "noarchive,noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 283204329838}, "parsely-section": "MW_Markets", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "og": {"site_name": "MarketWatch", "description": "Google has created a team, dubbed Project Zero, to hunt Web threats and hackers.", "title": "Google team to hunt Web threats, hackers", "url": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/google-team-to-hunt-web-threats-hackers-2014-07-15", "image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-BF580_google_MG_20130717132632.jpg", "type": "article"}, "ob": {"image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-BF580_google_MG_20130717132632.jpg"}, "article.id": "B711B858-0C2F-11E4-B65E-00212803FAD6", "position": 1}, "article_summary": "Getty ImagesSAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) \u2014 Google has set up a special team to take on hackers and other threats on the Web.\nThe Google team will take on threats even beyond Google products and will work with other software vendors in identifying and fixing network flaws.\nGoogle\u2019s GOOG, -0.16% GOOGL, -0.16% new initiative, dubbed \u201cProject Zero,\u201d aims to hunt cyber-threats and identify potential vulnerabilities on the Web that could be exploited by \u201ccriminal or state-sponsored\u201d actors.\nGoogle has also beefed up its encryption system to protect its network, including its Gmail service, after a massive secret government data-gathering program under the National Security System was exposed by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden.\nOne example is the so-called \u201cheartbleed\u201d bug discovered earlier this year that made large amounts of online data, including passwords, vulnerable to hackers."}
