Even a year's worth of successful compliance by those patients facing on-going conditions such as diabetes would prove beneficial to patient and insurer. The old marketing adage, \"Cash is King\" is a time tested truth for good reason. By offering cash rebates rather than less enticing discounts, health insurers and individuals both stand to benefit. Savings at the vitamin store and your next pair of glasses is nice, but not as enticing as a health insurance rebate check.\n\n\n\nHealth insurance companies are only a few simple mobile apps away from developing wellness cash back savings programs that benefit both the consumer and the insurer. Going to the gym or out for a walk? Check in with your \"Healthy Patient Discount\" app and get credit for it. Had your annual preventative exam and flu shot? Get credit for that, too. Take your children to get their vaccinations? Finish the year without any major health related issues because of your efforts? Look for your rebate check in the mail from your insurer. The parameters for these wellness programs, crafted by each insurer, could be used by the insurers as a means to educate and motivate their members, lessen risk and as a point of differentiation in their sales/marketing efforts to attract new members, just as all major automotive insurers have done through \"safe driver\" programs.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.expire_date": "2015-02-25 14:32:05 -0500", "og": {"url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/sarah-oleary/cash-back-incentives-a-wi_b_6700070.html", "site_name": "The Huffington Post", "image": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1464944/images/o-US_UK_CA-facebook.jpg", "type": "article", "locale": "en_US"}, "twitter": {"image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1464944/images/o-US_UK_CA-facebook.jpg", "height": 1000}, "site": "@HuffPostBiz", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "SarahOLearyHC"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-02-24 14:32:05 -0500", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=6700070", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "business", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "health,health care,health care reform,mental health,Health Insurance,obamacare,Affordable Care Act,insurance,safe driving,Insurance Companies", "article": {"section": "Business", "tag": "health,health care,health care reform,mental health,Health Insurance,obamacare,Affordable Care Act,insurance,safe driving,Insurance Companies", "published_time": "2015-02-24 14:32:05 -0500", "modified_time": "2015-04-26 05:59:01 -0400"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb957\"", "article_summary": "By offering cash rebates rather than less enticing discounts, health insurers and individuals both stand to benefit.\nHealth conscious consumers who have proven their value to insurers over the course of twelve months deserve to receive financial reimbursement for their efforts.\nHealth insurance companies are only a few simple mobile apps away from developing wellness cash back savings programs that benefit both the consumer and the insurer.\nSavings at the vitamin store and your next pair of glasses is nice, but not as enticing as a health insurance rebate check.\nEven a year's worth of successful compliance by those patients facing on-going conditions such as diabetes would prove beneficial to patient and insurer."}
