The following ran first in 2013. We re-run the story as a reminder of what enormous contributions Mr. Reagan made in the battle against abortion and infanticide and to contrast his vision with the impoverished alternative of pro-abortion President Barack Obama.\n\nBy Dave Andrusko\n\nOkay, I would be the first\u2013and I do mean the first\u2013\u2013to acknowledge that comparing President Obama\u2019s second inaugural address to virtually any speech President Reagan delivered would be unfair. President Reagan\u2019s speeches all but sang. They were music to the ear because of the language, the imagery, the passion, and the sense he delivered that he was one of us, speaking for\u2013and not to\u2013us.\n\n(I\u2019ve included a link to President Reagan\u2019s first inaugural address here. You can watch President Reagan deliver his speech on Youtube.)\n\nBy contrast President Obama\u2019s remarks today landed with a thunk. For a man who is incessantly praised for his speechmaking, his staff could have produced a more moving (not to say coherent) speech by extracting paragraphs from his 2012 Democratic National Convention remarks and various State of the Union Addresses and dropping them into the equivalent of a speech blender.\n\nPro-lifers immediately latched onto the portions of the speech which boast about how inclusive the President is. Everybody, including aunts and uncles, are part of the mosaic that is America. Everyone, that is, but the unborn child.\n\nBy his second sentence, President Obama is telling the nation\n\n\u201cWe affirm the promise of our democracy. We recall that what binds this nation together is not the colors of our skin or the tenets of our faith or the origins of our names. What makes us exceptional \u2013 what makes us American \u2013 is our allegiance to an idea, articulated in a declaration made more than two centuries ago: \u2018We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.\u2019\n\n\u201cToday we continue a never-ending journey, to bridge the meaning of those words with the realities of our time. For history tells us that while these truths may be self-evident, they have never been self-executing; that while freedom is a gift from God, it must be secured by His people here on Earth.\u201d\n\nOr, in the case of the little ones, wrest back protection from an overweening Supreme Court whose indefensible decision 40 years ago is protected by a political party which has made the ongoing annihilation of unborn children a leading tenet of its secular faith.\n\nLater in his speech, Obama said,\n\n\u201cWe, the people, still believe that our obligations as Americans are not just to ourselves, but to all posterity.\u201d\n\nAnd, ironically, that is as succinct an explanation for our cause as you could ever ask for. The line that runs through the heart of this tenacious debate is precisely what obligations we have to our posterity\u2014which holds true whether or not we deliberately chose to bring them into existence. Pro-lifers believe that this obligation is binding, pro-abortionists counter, \u201cThat\u2019s up to the woman.\u201d\n\nObama\u2019s rhetorical technique is to throw an itsy bitsy bone at those who disagree (usually in the form of a short sentence or dependent clause), before letting us know that his way is, of course, the only way. \u201cThrough it all, we have never relinquished our skepticism of central authority.\u201d This from a man who rammed through ObamaCare in the process commandeering control over 1/6th of the entire economy.\n\nNear the end of his remarks, Obama returned to the Declaration of Independence as justification for his government-centric vision for our future:\n\n\u201cThat is our generation\u2019s task\u2013to make these words, these rights, these values-of Life, and Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness\u2013real for every American.\u201d\n\nWe don\u2019t have \u201cto agree on every contour of life; it does not mean we will all define liberty in exactly the same way, or follow the same precise path to happiness,\u201d he said, but what we must do is \u201cto act in our time.\u201d\n\nWe agree on the necessity for action, disagree fundamentally on what form that action takes.\n\nFor the most pro-abortion President ever, the life of the unborn is important only in a negative sense: if his or her continuation is an inconvenience. All actions must expedite abortion\u2014better yet, multiple the number.\n\nBy contrast pro-lifers work to protect the defenseless and helpher mother to realize there is a better way through a difficult time. All actions are to find an optimistic solution.\n\nPresident Obama\u2019s victory last November was a bitter pill to swallow. We know his agenda for the unborn; all we have to do is read the position papers and legislation promoted by the likes of NARAL and Planned Parenthood. But we cannot give up; indeed, that thought would never, could never cross our minds.\n\nWhen Mr. Reagan took office in 1981, we faced a host of economic and foreign policy crises. As was his wont he neither minimized the gravity of the situation nor succumbed to the defeatism that the \u201cexperts\u201d insisted was inevitable.\n\nHe ended his First Augural Address this way [The President refers to Martin Treptow, who lost his life on the Western front during World War I.]:\n\n\u201cThe crisis we are facing today does not require of us the kind of sacrifice that Martin Treptow and so many thousands of others were called upon to make. It does require, however, our best effort and our willingness to believe in ourselves and to believe in our capacity to perform great deeds, to believe that together with God\u2019s help we can and will resolve the problems which now confront us.\n\nTo which President Reagan added,\n\n\u201cAnd after all, why shouldn\u2019t we believe that? We are all Americans.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://www.nationalrighttolifenews.org/news/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/ReaganObama31.jpg"}, "bitly-verification": "3d313669c834"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe265e\"", "article_summary": "By contrast President Obama\u2019s remarks today landed with a thunk.\nBy Dave AndruskoOkay, I would be the first\u2013and I do mean the first\u2013\u2013to acknowledge that comparing President Obama\u2019s second inaugural address to virtually any speech President Reagan delivered would be unfair.\nTo which President Reagan added,\u201cAnd after all, why shouldn\u2019t we believe that?\nYou can watch President Reagan deliver his speech on Youtube.)\nPresident Obama\u2019s victory last November was a bitter pill to swallow."}
