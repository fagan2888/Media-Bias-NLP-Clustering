A prototype of the Clinton “Ready for Action” figure is shown donning a blue power suit and pearls, and displaying a wide grin.

FCTRY is the small, Brooklyn-based product design studio that’s behind the Clinton action figure campaign. The company created an Obama action figure during the current commander in chief’s first presidential run in 2008.

On its Kickstarter site, FCTRY says, “We started with one goal; to make Hillary Clinton into an awesome iconic action figure. Basically, we’re hoping to kick off some light-hearted excitement about her campaign and the amazingly cool prospect of America getting its first woman president.”

Supporters who pledge at least $15 will receive one of the action figures of the former secretary of State.

Clinton wouldn’t be the first public figure to inspire an action figure. Several companies produced Sarah Palin toys during the 2008 White House race. Another action figure based on 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney wore a suit and tie.

The makers behind the Clinton figurine — which has also created mustache pacifiers and gummy bear night lights, among other quirky items — says, “If we get this product off the ground, we will found various ways to use it to help Hillary’s campaign. Promise.”
