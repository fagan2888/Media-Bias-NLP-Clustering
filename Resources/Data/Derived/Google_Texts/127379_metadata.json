I remember an episode where Ricky spanked Lucy, and I laughed. My mom freaked out, and I learned that a man was never to hit a woman. Ever. And that a woman could do more than be the mischievous housewife Lucy was.\n\nThinking back on the other women I saw on TV at the time (Mrs. Cunningham; Janet and Cindy; Jeannie; Mrs. Ingles; and Laura of Luke and Laura), few were particularly strong role models. I had to rely on my own life, which was luckily filled with the independent women absent from media. As I got older, I saw \u201cAnnie Hall\u201d and never quite understood why she was such an inspiration to women of her time, until a professor recently broke it down for me: Until Annie Hall, women didn\u2019t have their own pursuits (on the big screen and TV), they didn\u2019t dress like men, and they certainly weren\u2019t single in the city.\n\nBut there was one woman who came to mind who was different from all these other molds, and I watched her every Christmas season: Doris Walker, the heroine of the 1947 classic \u201cMiracle on 34th St.\u201d\n\nPlayed by Maureen O\u2019Hara, Doris Walker was an independent, corporate events planner \u2014 a divorced, single mother running the entire Macy\u2019s Thanksgiving Day Parade on her own. She had her own office, her own apartment on Central Park West (granted, in retrospect, it faced away from the park), and her life was distinctly free of a male partner to cater to. She was financially secure, and she seemed quite comfortable and satisfied with her position. The male protagonist, attorney Fred Gailey (John Payne), performed a rather unconventional courtship: He helped her domestically, supporting her daughter, making the coffee, and wearing an apron as he helped Doris in the kitchen with dinner.\n\nI didn\u2019t, as a young girl, realize how rare and ahead of their time these ideas were. When do we see another independent, divorced, successful, satisfied, single mother in mainstream media again? In fact, until the 1980s (and since), where are the happy, single, divorced, independent, financially secure, single moms on TV or in the movies?\n\nIndeed, rather than suffering a crisis or some other emotional instability or quirky neurosis so popular in media\u2019s portrayal of women today, Doris Walker\u2019s fault is that she is so practical, so committed to raising an intelligent, independent daughter, she simply refuses to share myths like Santa Claus or fairy tales of Prince Charming with her. Doris is firmly grounded in reality and the world she lives in, and she is determined to raise her daughter to be independent, to be strong, and to have no expectation of a man to rescue or save her \u2014 nor a man she must in any way cater to.\n\nThe film was noted for her independence. At the time of its release, \u201cMiracle on 34th St.\u201d was considered morally offensive, and the Legion of Decency found it objectionable because it \u201creflects the acceptability of divorce.\u201d\n\nDoris does, perhaps, take her quest for independence and practicality a bit too far: Susan doesn\u2019t get bedtime lullabies, and she is painfully ignorant as to how to play make-believe with her peers.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Doris Walker was the kind of well-rounded female character we don't see onscreen enough", "title": "Why \u201cMiracle on 34th Street\u201d is a feminist classic", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Doris Walker was the kind of well-rounded female character we don't see onscreen enough", "title": "Why \u201cMiracle on 34th Street\u201d is a feminist classic", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2013/12/25/why_miracle_on_34th_street_is_a_feminist_classic/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/12/miracle1.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Doris Walker was the kind of well-rounded female character we don't see onscreen enough", "title": "Why \u201cMiracle on 34th Street\u201d is a feminist classic", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/12/miracle1.png", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Valerie Vande Panne", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Christmas, Feminism, Gender, miracle on 34th st", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "I had to rely on my own life, which was luckily filled with the independent women absent from media.\nIn fact, until the 1980s (and since), where are the happy, single, divorced, independent, financially secure, single moms on TV or in the movies?\nWhen do we see another independent, divorced, successful, satisfied, single mother in mainstream media again?\nTopics: Christmas, Feminism, Gender, miracle on 34th st, Entertainment NewsAs a young girl, I watched reruns of \u201cI Love Lucy\u201d with my mom every day after school.\nMy mom freaked out, and I learned that a man was never to hit a woman."}
