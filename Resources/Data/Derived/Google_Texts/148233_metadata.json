Yes, the snacks have less than stellar nutritional values, but that\u2019s only a fraction of the problem. The real issue is we\u2019re most likely indulging in popcorn, candy, and soda when we\u2019re not even hungry.\n\nHeather Fink, a registered dietitian with Indiana University Health Sports Performance, gave Medical Daily the scoop on how to stay healthy while enjoying a night out at the theater. She assures it's possible to enjoy a movie without snacks. Even though most people associate food and movies, they do not have to go hand in hand.\n\n\u201cThis is a problem across the board. We associate a particular event, like watching a movie, or we could be watching TV or whatever kind of scenario, we automatically assume that goes with eating. And it can, but it doesn\u2019t have to, especially if a person isn\u2019t hungry then there would be really no reason that you would have to be eating while you watch a movie,\u201d Fink told Medical Daily.\n\nPeople love snacks at the movies so much, especially popcorn, that they will even consume the same amount of 14-day-old stale popcorn as they would hot, fresh popcorn. There was even a study done to prove this. In the study, 158 moviegoers were randomly given a medium or a large container of free popcorn that was either fresh or 14 days old. Following the movie, consumption measures were taken, along with measure of perceived taste. The findings indicated that people consume just as much popcorn, even if it\u2019s stale. Also, people ate significantly more popcorn when it was given to them in a large container.\n\nThe study was conducted by American professor Dr. Brian Wansink, who is also the author of the best-selling book, Mindless Eating: Why We Eat More Than We Think.\n\nInfographic courtesy of friendsEat Infographic courtesy of friendsEat\n\nBut what if you are hungry when you go to the movies? Heather suggested a few healthier salty and sweet options to carry along, like pretzels, dried fruit, or trail mix. While Heather stated these snacks are healthier than a bag of popcorn of a box of candy, she said, \u201cI think people get a little weary of always hearing about \u2018well here would be a healthier option,\u2019 and while that\u2019s an important topic, the true source of the problem is that we\u2019re not paying attention and we\u2019re just mindlessly eating, so it doesn\u2019t really matter what you\u2019re mindlessly eating. That\u2019s the true core of the problem.\u201d\n\nFor those of you who just can\u2019t seem to resist the buttery popcorn, here are some tips of how to consume it in a more healthful way.\n\n\u201cWe can still enjoy popcorn or candy of any sort, but a person doesn\u2019t have to eat quite as much. They don\u2019t have to eat the whole box. They can share it with someone or just get a smaller container to share with someone and therefore you\u2019re eating less,\u201d Fink said.\n\nWe should be sharing our popcorn because after all, the average popcorn bag used to hold about 5 to 6 cups of popcorn. Today, it\u2019s closer to 20 cups. In addition, a typical snack combo (medium popcorn, medium soda and a candy item) has more fat, carbs, and salt than you\u2019re supposed to eat in an entire day.\n\nFor more shocking facts about movie theater snacks, check out the infographic posted on global food blog, friendsEat.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "movie theater snacks", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Most movie theater snacks are loaded with calories, fat, carbs, and salt, but that isn\u2019t the only reason why we should be avoiding them.", "title": "Why We Don't Need To Eat Snacks At The Movie Theater [INFOGRAPHIC]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/unhealthy-truth-about-movie-theater-snacks-and-why-we-dont-need-them-293362", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/16/movie-theater-snacks_0.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Most movie theater snacks are loaded with calories, fat, carbs, and salt, but that isn\u2019t the only reason why we should be avoiding them.", "title": "Why We Don't Need To Eat Snacks At The Movie Theater [INFOGRAPHIC]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/unhealthy-truth-about-movie-theater-snacks-and-why-we-dont-need-them-293362", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/16/movie-theater-snacks_0.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/16/movie-theater-snacks_0.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2014-07-16T14:18:26-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-16T14:18:25-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Most movie theater snacks are loaded with calories, fat, carbs, and salt, but that isn\u2019t the only reason why we should be avoiding them."}, "article_summary": "For more shocking facts about movie theater snacks, check out the infographic posted on global food blog, friendsEat.\nfriendsEatIt\u2019s unnecessary to eat snacks at the movie theater, but probably not for the reason you think.\nThe problem with snacking at the movie theater is we too often associate movies with eating, even when we\u2019re not hungry.\nThe real issue is we\u2019re most likely indulging in popcorn, candy, and soda when we\u2019re not even hungry.\nShe assures it's possible to enjoy a movie without snacks."}
