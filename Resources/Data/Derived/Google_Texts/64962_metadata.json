Ted Cruz misused his name to denounce the Affordable Care Act. Andrew Foltz Morrison\n\nJohn Connelly was not watching when Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said his name during Cruz\u2019s 21-hour marathon speech on the Senate floor earlier this week to rally fellow Republicans against the Affordable Care Act.\n\nConnelly, a 22-year-old student at Rutgers University, heard about it only the next day when a friend messaged him on Facebook to tell him the news \u2014 and he was not exactly thrilled. In fact, he is supportive of the law and has already reaped some of the benefits of the ACA, often referred to by its detractors as \u201cObamacare.\u201d\n\nCruz had gotten the student's name from an article in The Wall Street Journal about soaring youth unemployment, and read a passage about Connelly\u2019s circumstances aloud to illustrate the kind of world President Barack Obama\u2019s policies, health care law included, had created.\n\n\u201cJohn Connelly thought he was on the right track in life. The son of a New Jersey auto mechanic, he was the first in his family to go to college when he enrolled in Rutgers in 2009,\u201d Cruz read. \u201cFour years later, the 22-year-old found himself $21,000 in debt, without a permanent job and sleeping on friends' couches in New Jersey and Brooklyn.\u201d\n\nThose facts were true, Connelly said, but Cruz didn\u2019t have the context quite right.\n\n\u201cI guess he didn\u2019t read it very well,\u201d said Connelly, who found a grant that allowed him to re-enroll in school.\n\nConnelly has indeed struggled with managing his debt and affording tuition, but he doesn\u2019t blame those circumstances on the Obama administration.\n\nIn fact, he grew up in a working-class union household and describes his politics as \u201cleft of most of the people in the Democratic Party on social and economic issues.\u201d He thinks a single-payer system would be preferable to the Affordable Care Act but appreciates the provisions of the law that have helped him out already.\n\nHis father\u2019s union-provided health insurance still covers him, thanks to the provision of the ACA that allows children to stay on their parents\u2019 plan until the age of 26. Private insurers are no longer allowed to deny his younger sister coverage, even though she suffers from a seizure disorder that qualifies as a pre-existing condition.\n\n\u201cIt is not the giant burden on the future as Cruz painted it,\u201d Connelly said.\n\nHe added that he doesn\u2019t have much of a high opinion of the senator who held him up as a poster child for all that was wrong with the Obama economy.\n\n\u201cMaybe he should\u2019ve spent less time reading Dr. Seuss and more time looking into the policies that he\u2019s talking about,\u201d Connelly said, referring to Cruz reading from Dr. Seuss' children's book \"Green Eggs and Ham\" during his speech.", "article_metadata": {"description": "College student cited in senator's talkathon says Cruz should read less Dr. Seuss, spend more time on health care policy", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.aljazeera.simple", "og": {"url": "http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2013/9/27/cruz-s-anti-obamacareposterchildturnsouttolikethelaw.html", "image": {"width": 960, "identifier": "http://america.aljazeera.com/content/ajam/articles/2013/9/27/cruz-s-anti-obamacareposterchildturnsouttolikethelaw/jcr:content/mainpar/adaptiveimage/src.adapt.960.high.john_connelly_092713.1380361891634.jpg", "height": 600}, "type": "article", "description": "College student cited in senator's talkathon says Cruz should read less Dr. Seuss, spend more time on health care policy", "title": "Ted Cruz's anti-'Obamacare' poster child likes the health care law"}, "twitter": {"site": "@AJAM", "image": "http://america.aljazeera.com/content/ajam/articles/2013/9/27/cruz-s-anti-obamacareposterchildturnsouttolikethelaw/jcr:content/mainpar/adaptiveimage/src.adapt.960.high.john_connelly_092713.1380361891634.jpg", "description": "College student cited in senator's talkathon says Cruz should read less Dr. Seuss, spend more time on health care policy", "card": "summary", "title": "Ted Cruz's anti-'Obamacare' poster child likes the health care law"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=810543104, affiliate-data=10lxKx", "keywords": "Politics, Health Care, Congress, Obamacare, U.S.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fceb71\"", "article_summary": "Rutgers student John Connelly, right, says Sen.
