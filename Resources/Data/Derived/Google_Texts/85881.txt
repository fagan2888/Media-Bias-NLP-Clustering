Despite concerns from the departments of Health and Human Services, Hawaii lawmakers are pushing forward bills that would help the adult care-home industry make more money while potentially compromising the quality of services provided to those most in need.

Residential care facilities serve thousands of residents in hundreds of homes statewide, but operators say they have struggled to make ends meet because state payments have failed to keep pace with increasing costs.

In a budget year with limited discretionary spending, the Legislature has mostly shelved solutions that would come out of taxpayers’ pockets. But the alternatives have raised eyebrows and created uncertainty.

House Bill 600 changes the ratio of Medicaid to private-pay clients who are allowed in community care family foster homes, known as CCFFHs.

The state currently lets this type of home have up to three clients. Two must be on Medicaid and one can pay out of his or her own pocket.

The bill would flip this by allowing two private-pay clients and one Medicaid recipient, which could leave the poor with fewer places to go for long-term care — something health officials highlighted and supporters of the legislation acknowledged.

Testimony on the bill from care home operators overwhelmingly shows they want it to pass to help them bring in more income, which they say would allow them to improve services and help them avoid having to get a second job.

Vice Speaker John Mizuno, whose name is on virtually every care home bill, maintains that this one is all about helping married couples live together.
