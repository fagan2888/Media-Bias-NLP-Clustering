The in-house journal of the liberal left, the Guardian, has returned to a story it ran prior to Labour\u2019s historic election defeat in order to remind readers that Young Republicans worked for the Conservative Party and were \u201cvery much appreciated.\u201d\n\nPrior to the election the story the paper ran was intended to smear the Conservatives in whose constituencies the volunteers were deployed. The Guardian then reported :\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\n\u201cThe expected arrival of the US activists has infuriated Labour candidates in the targeted seats, who pointed out the Republican party\u2019s opposition to President Barack Obama\u2019s healthcare reforms aimed at improving care for the poorest in society.\u201d\n\nGoing further still the paper reported that Fiona Dent, the soon to be defeated Labour candidate for Windsor, labelled the visit a \u201csubversion of democracy\u201d because it used volunteers who don\u2019t live in the UK. She was not asked to comment on her own party\u2019s paid use of President Obama\u2019s own David Axelrod as a senior strategic adviser, despite his American nationality.\n\nIn the follow up the Guardian revealed the full extent of the \u201csubversion\u201d \u2013 the International Committee of the Young Republican National Federation sent seven young Republicans to four constituencies. In two of them sitting Conservative MPs were defeated, in one the sitting Labour MP one won and in the final one the Conservative Party replaced the previous MP with a new one.\n\nDespite the rather meagre results the left\u2019s reaction remains one of anti-American self-righteous anger at the intervention. One online comment to the Guardian identifies the intervention as \u201cthe first innocent steps toward the Ultimate Republican Takeover of England (to hell with those commie Scots!). Preparing it to become the USA\u2019s 51st State.\u201d Another advises \u201cbow your neck before your american masters.\u201d\n\nThose posting comment then descend into outright abuse \u201cNazi yanks **** off\u201d and \u201cjust goes to prove \u2013 these are vile tea party scum. Whoever voted for them needs to get a grip\u201d before descending into outright paranoia illustrated by this poster \u201cYoung Republicans or undercover CIA Spies? Was election fixed like referendum allegedly?\u201d\n\nThere are too many comments to reproduce here, but anyone wanting to see the full extent of the left\u2019s delusion in the UK could do worse than read the full comment thread below Guardian articles such as these.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Lefty Meltdown Continues: Now They Blame The Republican Party For Labour's Epic Defeat", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Lefty Meltdown Continues: Now They Blame The Republican Party For Labour's Epic Defeat", "title": "Lefty Meltdown Continues: Now They Blame The Republican Party For Labour's Epic Defeat - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 3091, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/05/ap_ed-miliband_ap-photo.jpg", "height": 2061}, "updated_time": "2015-05-13T01:49:37-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-journalism/2015/05/13/lefty-meltdown-continues-now-they-blame-the-republican-party-for-labours-epic-defeat/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Lefty Meltdown Continues: Now They Blame The Republican Party For Labour's Epic Defeat", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/05/ap_ed-miliband_ap-photo.jpg", "title": "Lefty Meltdown Continues: Now They Blame The Republican Party For Labour's Epic Defeat - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": ",Big Journalism, Breitbart London,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Journalism", "published_time": "2015-05-13T01:41:36-07:00", "categories": "Big Journalism,Breitbart London", "modified_time": "2015-05-13T01:49:37-07:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb466\"", "article_summary": "Whoever voted for them needs to get a grip\u201d before descending into outright paranoia illustrated by this poster \u201cYoung Republicans or undercover CIA Spies?\nIn the follow up the Guardian revealed the full extent of the \u201csubversion\u201d \u2013 the International Committee of the Young Republican National Federation sent seven young Republicans to four constituencies.\nIn two of them sitting Conservative MPs were defeated, in one the sitting Labour MP one won and in the final one the Conservative Party replaced the previous MP with a new one.\nOne online comment to the Guardian identifies the intervention as \u201cthe first innocent steps toward the Ultimate Republican Takeover of England (to hell with those commie Scots!).\nDespite the rather meagre results the left\u2019s reaction remains one of anti-American self-righteous anger at the intervention."}
