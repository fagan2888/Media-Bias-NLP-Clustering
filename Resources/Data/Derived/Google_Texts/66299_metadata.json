The division, TRU Simulation + Training Inc, will produce a suite of equipment to instruct pilots on flying and landing the aircraft in a range of situations, in time for the 2020 delivery date Boeing has set for the first 777X. The executives did not disclose the monetary value of the contract. \"It remains a very competitive segment\" of the market, said the unit's chief executive, Ian Walsh, adding that simulator contracts at top manufacturers such as Boeing \"are the hardest to win.\" TRU said it won a contract to develop and supply a full flight training suite for Boeing 737 MAX aircraft less than two years ago.
