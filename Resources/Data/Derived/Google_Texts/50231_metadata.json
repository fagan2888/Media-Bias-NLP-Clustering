The applications include projects that are still awaiting approval and whose review extended into 2016.\n\nOn the project list from the state are an assortment of mundane investments to replace or upgrade medical equipment such as MRI and CT scanners, plus numerous sales of nursing homes throughout Michigan.\n\nThe list also includes large and small capital projects to develop new facilities or expand and renovate existing facilities ranging from ambulatory care centers, medical office buildings and even a handful of replacement hospitals. For example, the $389.5 million plans for a new hospital at Marquette General in the U.P. is the single-largest project in the state.\n\nThe activity has been ramping up the last couple of years following the economic turmoil of 2008 to 2010, a period where \u201cthe brakes were put on\u201d large capital projects as financing was difficult to secure, said Anthony Colarossi, a health care consulting partner at Plante Moran PLLC. On top of that came the passage of the Affordable Care Act that created uncertainty, plus the emergence of population health where care providers are compensated by how well they care for the people they serve versus the volume of care they provide.\n\nAfter adjusting to the new era of health care, health systems are now proceeding with corresponding capital investments, Colarossi said.\n\n\u201cPeople have kind of figured out their strategies now, and their strategies are quite different than what we saw in the 2000s,\u201d Colarossi said.\n\nMuch of the focus for health systems today is developing ambulatory capabilities and renovating existing buildings or developing new facilities, Colarossi said. Health systems need facilities that are much more flexible \u201cso it can go back and forth from one type of service area to another very easily so that they\u2019re not investing in bricks and mortar in a foolish manner,\u201d he said.\n\nDuring the Great Recession, many health systems also identified inefficiencies in their facilities as they sought to generate cost savings. As the economy recovered and interest rates remained low, health systems began to \u201cimplement some of those things to fix some of those inefficiencies\u201d through renovations, Colarossi said.\n\nConstruction projects of note in West Michigan that earned CON approval in 2015 include:\n\nThe Mercy Health expansion and renovation in Muskegon that will consolidate in-patient care at the Mercy Hospital campus and drive efficiencies by eliminating redundancies with the Hackley Hospital campus about three miles away. The Hackley campus will become an outpatient medical center.\n\n\n\n\n\nexpansion and renovation in Muskegon that will consolidate in-patient care at the Mercy Hospital campus and drive efficiencies by eliminating redundancies with the Hackley Hospital campus about three miles away.

In Lansing, Sparrow Health System broke ground last May on the Herbert-Herman Cancer Center, a project where the state waived a CON review. In its letter of intent to the state filed in February, Sparrow listed the cost of the 147,000-square-foot, four-story building at $55 million.\n\nColarossi expects growth in health care construction to continue for the foreseeable future. Health systems will develop more \u201ccenters of excellence\u201d and consolidate physician practices and other professionals into those centers.\n\n\u201cThis has legs,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to see some old campuses close, especially when you\u2019re looking at what\u2019s happening in rural markets and new buildings come up that are more focused to what really needs to occur in that community. If you haven\u2019t constructed a facility in the last 10 years, you\u2019re going to see significant renovation in order to make it more specific to the identified centers of excellence that are going happen at that campus.\n\n\u201cThis is a 10-year stretch that you\u2019re looking at.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "At $271.2 million, the expansion and renovation at Mercy Health's\u00a0Mercy Hospital\u00a0campus in Muskegon stands as one of the largest health care...", "generator": "runengine.com", "rights": "www.MiBiz.com", "og": {"url": "https://mibiz.com/item/23327-health-care-building-projects-spike-in-2015,-state-approved-383-projects-worth-", "image": "http://mibiz.com/media/k2/items/cache/c73637fefe5773e6eff419b3f996bcdd_XL.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "At $271.2 million, the expansion and renovation at Mercy Health's\u00a0Mercy Hospital\u00a0campus in Muskegon stands as one of the largest health care...", "title": "Health care building projects spike in 2015, State approved 383 projects worth $2.78 billion"}, "image": "https://mibiz.com/media/k2/items/cache/c73637fefe5773e6eff419b3f996bcdd_S.jpg", "title": "Health care building projects spike in 2015, State approved 383 projects worth $2.78 billion", "author": "Mark Sanchez", "keywords": "Mercy Health\u2019s Hackley Hospital,Michigan Department of Health and Human Services,Anthony Colarossi,Plante Moran PLLC,The Mercy Health,North Ottawa Community Hospital,Spectrum Health,Sparrow Health System", "original-source": "https://mibiz.com/item/23327-health-care-building-projects-spike-in-2015,-state-approved-383-projects-worth-"}, "article_summary": "After adjusting to the new era of health care, health systems are now proceeding with corresponding capital investments, Colarossi said.\nDuring the Great Recession, many health systems also identified inefficiencies in their facilities as they sought to generate cost savings.\nMuch of the focus for health systems today is developing ambulatory capabilities and renovating existing buildings or developing new facilities, Colarossi said.\nHealth systems will develop more \u201ccenters of excellence\u201d and consolidate physician practices and other professionals into those centers.\nAt $271.2 million, the expansion and renovation at Mercy Health's Mercy Hospital campus in Muskegon stands as one of the largest health care projects in Michigan today."}
