But is the United States military set up to do it? Not according to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, America\u2019s top military officer.\n\nAt least not without a complete restructuring of military responsibilities and a reorganization of combat commands that are still geared to fighting nation states within physical borders\u2014not Islamic terrorists in isolated cells. That\u2019s what General Joseph Dunford said on Monday at a national security forum co-hosted by the Center for a New American Security and Defense One.\n\nRelated: Obama Says Faster Progress Needed Against ISIS\n\nDunford didn\u2019t try to put a positive spin on a negative situation. \u201cIt\u2019s my assumption today that it would be very difficult for any conflict to be isolated to a region,\u201d Dunford said. \u201cWhen you think about potential adversaries in the future, I think we need to think about strategy right up front that takes into account it is in all likelihood going to be in that way.\u201d\n\nA recap of Dunford\u2019s remarks in Defense One cited the example of a ballistic missile launched in one part of the world, hitting a target on the other side of the globe, and passing through a myriad of jurisdictions of generals and admirals. Dunford wants a one-world operational command view \u2013 not a series of territorial siloes that render decision making a slow and tortuous process.\n\nDunford\u2019s plan is also an admission that the Pentagon hasn\u2019t prepared for the inevitable war against ISIS, al-Qaeda, Boko Haram, or any other group or groups that can operate without borders.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Destroying ISIS is job number one for President Obama and most Americans.", "title": "America\u2019s Top General Says We\u2019re Not Ready to Defeat ISIS", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/12/15/America-s-Top-General-Says-We-re-Not-Ready-Defeat-ISIS", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/RTX1JQN9.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/12/15/America-s-Top-General-Says-We-re-Not-Ready-Defeat-ISIS", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/RTX1JQN9.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@jackieleo"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Destroying ISIS is job number one for President Obama and most Americans.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "But is the United States military set up to do it?\nThat\u2019s what General Joseph Dunford said on Monday at a national security forum co-hosted by the Center for a New American Security and Defense One.\nNot according to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, America\u2019s top military officer.\nDestroying ISIS is job number one for President Obama and most Americans.\n\u201cIt\u2019s my assumption today that it would be very difficult for any conflict to be isolated to a region,\u201d Dunford said."}
