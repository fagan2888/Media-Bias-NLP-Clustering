Manufacturers are rationing saline \u2014 a product used all over the hospital to clean wounds, mix medications or treat dehydration. Now drug companies say they won\u2019t be able to catch up with demand until next year.\n\nThat leaves San Francisco General Hospital\u2019s materials manager, Reid Kennedy, in a fix. Kennedy is in charge of managing all the gloves, bandages, bedpans and IV solutions for all the medical floors, emergency room and operating room.\n\nHe first got a call last year from his vendor telling him they might not be able to deliver his full order.\n\n\u201cWe were put on notice that it was going to be tight,\u201d he said, walking through the basement warehouse.\n\nThen things got worse in January. The flu season hit much harder than expected, and sick people flooded into hospitals. Saline bags flew off the shelves to treat dehydration. Demand far outstripped supply.\n\n\u201cThe flu season knocked us out as an industry,\u201d Kennedy said. Though hospital administrators say the shortage hasn\u2019t affected the quality of patient care, Kennedy uses the word \u201ccrisis\u201d to describe the shortage.\n\nIt\u2019s Harder to Make Than You Think\n\n\u2018To make one of these drugs is very complex, even though the drug itself is simple.\u2019 Valerie Jensen, FDA\n\nBut can salty water really be that hard to come by? Kennedy pays $1.57 per bag. Why can\u2019t drug companies just whip up some more?\n\n\u201cTo make one of these drugs is very complex, even though the drug itself is simple,\u201d said Valerie Jensen, the director of the drug shortage program at the Food and Drug Administration. \u201cIt takes about three weeks to make one batch of normal saline from start to finish.\u201d\n\nShe says the key challenge is making sure saline products are sterile. If you swallow a pill with a little bit of dirt on it, you\u2019ll be fine. But if a nurse injects saline into your vein that\u2019s even a little bit contaminated, you have a big problem. More than 30 steps and a range of supplies are involved in producing sterile saline. Jensen says FDA inspectors have reason to keep a close eye on any drug injected intravenously. She says they\u2019ve found some nasty things in IV drugs: bacteria, mold, glass particles.\n\n\u201cThese are issues that absolutely would be a safety risk for patients,\u201d she said.\n\nThat\u2019s why the FDA sets strict quality standards for the facilities that manufacture saline and other IV drugs. But the agency has to find a delicate balance between safety and supply.\n\nSome suppliers suggest keeping up with the FDA\u2019s standards is too onerous and may be playing a part in the shortage.\n\n\u201cA lot of variables came together to create this,\u201d said Scott Crandall, director of medical supply contracts at Novation, a group buying organization in Texas that manages contracts for SF General and 2,000 other hospitals across the country. He\u2019s been hearing from manufacturers that increased FDA scrutiny is interfering with drug production.\n\n\u201cDuring the last year, all suppliers had issues in their facilities where they had to correct certain things the FDA found.\u201d\n\nSome of those things were serious. Hospira, one manufacturer of saline, issued a recall earlier this year because of leaks in its saline bags. Before that, Baxter found particles in its saline vials and had to recall four lots. Both companies say the recalls had no bearing on the current shortage.\n\nFlu Season Causes Headaches\n\nBut Crandall says inspections and maintenance require shutting down machines. And when machines aren\u2019t operating, less saline is getting shipped. Last winter, he says maintenance closures \u201cslowed production down, 10 to 20 percent.\u201d\n\nSo the industry was already behind when the flu season hit.\n\nThe procurement director for a group of dialysis centers says his supplier, Baxter, told him the main problem was winter weather. Snow and ice storms in the Midwest were delaying trucks headed for California.\n\n\u201cAs the weather got worse, we began to see more and more back-order issues,\u201d said Colin Carthen of Satellite Healthcare, which runs 70 dialysis centers across California and the U.S. Each patient comes in three or four times a week, and each time goes through one to two liters of saline to clean the blood and prevent clotting. At the worst of the shortage, Carthen realized the health of 6,000 patients depended on the administrative magic tricks he could perform behind the scenes.\n\n\u201cI called up a clinical person that I knew, at like 11:30 at night and said, \u2018Well, what happens if we run out of saline?\u2019 Because I was really afraid,\u201d he remembers. \u201cAnd they were just like, \u2018Yeah, it gets ugly, fast.\u2019\u201d\n\nCarthen says he\u2019s lucky that didn\u2019t happen. Every day, he spent hours on the phone with suppliers and clinical staff, juggling and rerouting supplies so everyone had what they needed.\n\nKeeping the Supply from Drying Up\n\nHospitals have developed new clinical protocols to conserve supplies during the shortage. Nurses at SF General are using smaller saline bags when possible, and transitioning patients who still need hydration to drink water from cups a little sooner than they did in the past. Kennedy has spent hours talking with pharmaceutical and clinical staff about when to use these conservation measures, to make sure there is enough saline to go around.\n\n\u201cPie is a good analogy. Now I\u2019m going to use 16 slices of pie instead of eight slices of pie, and I\u2019ll be able to feed 16 people instead of eight,\u201d he said.\n\nThe FDA is trying to mitigate the shortage by importing saline from Spain and Norway. But FDA economist Marta Wosinska says that\u2019s not a sustainable solution, since those countries have to supply their own hospitals.\n\n\u201cThere is no spot market. You can\u2019t buy it like pork bellies or grains or oil. You cannot go on a marketplace and order a certain amount,\u201d she said.\n\nU.S. companies also don\u2019t have the capacity to ramp up production. They only have so many machines, and a lot of them are tied up producing other essential drugs. Building new facilities is hardly an option.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about hundreds of millions of dollars and it would take three to five years,\u201d Wosinska said.\n\nThe drug companies don\u2019t face any real penalties if they don\u2019t come through with saline supplies. Contract loopholes release them from paying any fees to their customers if a drug shortage is industry-wide, as this one is.\n\nBoth Baxter and Hospira, the top two saline producers in the country, say they are doing all they can to maximize production. Each points a finger at the other for contributing to the shortage.\n\n\u201cWe saw increased demand amid decreased product availability from competitors as the main driver,\u201d a Baxter spokesman wrote in an email.\n\nA Hospira spokesman countered: \u201cHospira began seeing stronger demand for its saline products in late 2013 when another manufacturer began to experience manufacturing issues.\u201d\n\nHospira reported a 20 percent increase in U.S. net sales of its injectable drugs between January and March, citing \u201cincreased volume due to competitor supply issues,\u201d in its latest quarterly financial report.\n\n\u201cThe Most Expensive Drug Shortage in History\u201d\n\nThe burden ultimately lands on hospitals, clinics, and dialysis centers to come up with their own workarounds. And all that staff time adds up. Hospitals spend $216 million a year on the labor costs of managing drug shortages, according to Erin Fox, a professor at the University of Utah College of Pharmacy.\n\nNow that the industry has indicated the saline shortage will extend through the end of the year, Fox estimates this will be the most expensive drug shortage in history.\n\n\u201cIV fluids are used as a supply as well as a treatment, so the shortage impacts the largest number of hospital personnel, as well as patients, compared to any other shortage we have followed,\u201d she said. \u201cIV fluids impact almost every single patient and every single floor. That means you have to educate and get a message out to multiple groups of people rather than a selected group, like for an anesthesia drug or a cancer drug.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nFor now, the actual cost of saline is steady. Hospitals are protected under contracts that keep prices locked through next year. But Novation\u2019s Scott Crandall says that is very likely to change when those contracts expire.\n\n\u201cThe suppliers have already signaled to the market that they plan on increasing price significantly,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd when I say that, it could double and triple in some aspects.\u201d\n\nFox says that would be far better than the current situation.\n\n\u201cIt is far cheaper for hospitals to pay $3 a bag for saline and have a consistent and quality product \u2014 not recalled due to contaminants, or leakage,\u201d she said, \u201cthan it is to potentially delay elective surgeries or make workarounds that change weekly or daily due to inconsistent supply.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hospitals use saline for everything from wound care to surgeries, but it could be next year before drug companies can catch up with demand.
