The Brush Creek Ranch was voluntarily evacuated Friday night.\n\nOn Saturday afternoon, about 100 firefighters were on the ground trying to get a ring around the 229-acre fire while a helicopter dropped water from above, firefighters said.\n\nThe blaze is burning roughly 2 miles north of Colorado 9 near Ute Pass Road. Part of the fire is on the Brush Creek Ranch.\n\nThe fire, near the community of Heeney, was renamed the Brush Creek fire Saturday. It was originally named the Cemetery Ridge fire. The fire is burning dried grasses, beetle-killed pines and aspens.\n\nJeff Berino, Lake Dillon fire chief, told the Summit Daily that the wind has made it difficult for firefighters.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a challenge as the wind is shifting back and forth,\u201d he said. \u201cFortunately, it\u2019s in an isolated area.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s probably going to take a few days to get it 100 percent contained, but we\u2019re pretty confident that the threat to the highway and any structures here locally will be pretty well minimized once we get this area in front of us buttoned up,\u201d Lake Dillon Assistant Fire Chief Bruce Farrell told 7News.\n\nThe Summit County Sheriff\u2019s Office said on Twitter that local and mutual aid engines were working the blaze, along with the U.S. Forest Service.\n\nFirefighters involved include Breckenridge\u2019s Red, White & Blue Fire, Copper Mountain Fire, NorthWest Fire from Park County, Vail Fire and Kremmling Fire.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Colorado wildfires: Blaze north of Silverthorne 30 percent contained", "title": "Colorado wildfires: Blaze north of Silverthorne 30 percent contained", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/10/03/colorado-wildfires-blaze-north-of-silverthorne-30-percent-contained/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151002_065527_Silverthorne-Fire-from-CDOT-1.jpg", "height": 450}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151002_065527_Silverthorne-Fire-from-CDOT-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-10-03T10:16:07+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-21T11:37:13+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Wildfires"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdad8b\"", "article_summary": "A wildfire burning north of Silverthorne was 30 percent contained Saturday evening, and Lake Dillon Fire Rescue estimated it would be fully contained by 7 p.m. Sunday.\nThe fire, near the community of Heeney, was renamed the Brush Creek fire Saturday.\nThe Brush Creek Ranch was voluntarily evacuated Friday night.\nPart of the fire is on the Brush Creek Ranch.\nJeff Berino, Lake Dillon fire chief, told the Summit Daily that the wind has made it difficult for firefighters."}
