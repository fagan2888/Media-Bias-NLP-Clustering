Scott DesJarlais learned recently that he's cancer-free, he said during a Monday phone interview.\n\n\"My oncologist felt very good about it,\" said DesJarlais, a Republican from South Pittsburg who worked as a physician before he won his seat in Congress in 2010. \"We had a great report in May. My PET scan was clear. It's a pretty good sign.\"\n\nDesJarlais found out he had cancer in his neck nearly a year ago in July before winning a tight Aug. 7, 2014, GOP primary by 38 votes against state Sen. Jim Tracy of Shelbyville.\n\n\"We were undergoing treatments for the three weeks leading up to the election,\" DesJarlais said.\n\nWhen it comes to the 2016 election, Tracy said Monday during an interview at The Daily News Journal that he's yet to decide if he'll run again for the 4th Congressional District seat.\n\nThe congressman also defeated Democrat Lenda Sherrell in the November general election during a time his treatment continued.\n\nDesJarlais also faces a Republican campaign challenge from Grant Starrett, a 2012 Vanderbilt University Law School graduate who grew up in California and now lives in Murfreesboro.\n\n\"Grant continues to attack me as a liberal, which I think most people find as laughable,\" said DesJarnais, who touts being ranked by the National Journal as the fourth-most conservative member of Congress.\n\nAlthough Starrett boasted in late April about raising more than $500,000, including his own $250,000 donation to the campaign, DesJarlais said he's confident about running to keep the seat in Congress after the incumbent reported raising $144,677 for the 2016 race.\n\n\"I think we are in a very strong position,\" DesJarlais said. \"We feel healthy. I think constituents are pleased I have done what I said I would do. For three straight elections, I have delivered on the promises from when I first ran.\"\n\nObamacare\n\nDesJarlais said he will continue to oppose \"Obamacare\" and hopes the U.S. Supreme Court in the King vs. Burwell case soon will rule that the federal government offering tax subsidies and credits to those buying health insurance through an exchange established by the national government is unconstitutional, when the Affordable Care Act requires that the exchanges be set up by the states.\n\n\"It will essentially cripple the law,\" DesJarlais said. \"The Obama administration went outside the legislative branch to change the law. The IRS issued a rule that was outside the Constitution. The president will have to accept that it will fail in its current form. The first step is to repeal Obamacare once and for all.\"\n\nEven if the nation's top court decides that the federal exchanges are legal, DesJarlais said he will continue to seek repeal of the Affordable Care Act at a time people are projected to face double-digit premium hikes next year.\n\n\"Public opinion (for the health care law) will continue to diminish,\" DesJarlais said. \"We will continue to offer ideas that will make health care accessible and affordable. When we get a new president, we will continue to push to repeal this bad law.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: http://on.dnj.com/1JQFsms", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "U.S. Rep.
