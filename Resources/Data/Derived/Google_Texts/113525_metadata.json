Still, UKW\u2019s opinions have all curiously received the stamp of approval from DOD\u2019s IG.\n\nThough not always because the IG agreed with the assessment.\n\nIn fact, one year the IG was poised to issue a \u201cnon-endorsement\u201d on UKW\u2019s opinion, but it was quickly scrapped after DOD Chief Financial officer Robert Hale \u201ccut a deal\u201d with a top IG official to reverse impending IG budget and staff cuts in exchange for suppressing the non-endorsement.\n\n\"It looks like the Defense Finance and Accounting Service may be trying to hide its own problems by pretending their books are in order,\u201d Grassley said. \u201cAnd to make matters worse, the institution that exists to root out fraud, waste and abuse \u2013 appears to have played the role of silent enabler in the alleged misconduct\u2026 It\u2019s a disgrace to the Inspector General community.\u201d\n\nRelated: Pentagon\u2019s Failure to Audit Contracts Wastes Billions\n\nDFAS is also accused of making improper payments to UKW for hours that it wasn\u2019t on the job. And even though DFAS and IG officials both knew the payments were improper, they \u201celected\u201d not to formally report them, according to whistleblowers.\n\nThe report comes just as DOD is preparing to absorb more budget cuts under the second wave of sequestration mandated under the Budget Control Act. And while top defense officials warn that the impending cuts could spell trouble for military readiness and national security, the department\u2019s top auditing agency and its IG don\u2019t seem to be too worried about finances, since they\u2019re allegedly covering up abusive auditing practices.\n\n\u201cSequestration cuts should be guided by hard-hitting, rock-solid audits, but rock-solid audits performed by the DOD IG are scarce,\u201d Grassley said in a letter to Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel. So long as DOD isn\u2019t able to accurately report on how it spends taxpayers money, and audits remain weak and ineffective, the probability of rooting out fraud and waste during sequestration remains very low.\u201d\n\nRelated: Pentagon Mocks Sequester with New Millions Wasted\n\nIndeed, the Pentagon has never successfully been audited since at least 1996 - the year federal agencies were first required by law to be audited. But now, DOD is under pressure to balance its books before 2017, in order to comply with the Chief Financial Officers Act.\n\nMeeting that deadline, however, is going to be a challenge, since the department\u2019s auditing agency tasked with leading the effort is the same agency being accused of cooking its books.\n\n\u201cDFAS\u2019 apparent inability to accurately report on its own internal \u201chousekeeping\u201d accounts of $1.5 billion, casts doubt on its ability to accurately report on the hundreds of billions DOD spends each year, as it is required to do under the law,\u201d Grassley said. \u201cIf DFAS can\u2019t pass the CFO audit test then who in the department can?\u201d\n\nFollow Brianna Ehley on Twitter @BriannaEhley\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The agency in charge of keeping the Pentagon\u2019s financial house in order might be sweep", "title": "Accounting Fraud at the Defense Department?
