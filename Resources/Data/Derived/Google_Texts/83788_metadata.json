The rates are not seasonally adjusted, meaning there will be a rise as high school and college students complete their studies.\n\nKing County has reached its lowest jobless rate since April 2008, at the onset of the Great Recession. The county\u2019s unemployment in April 2014 stood at 4.1 percent.\n\nThe preliminary statewide rate, seasonally adjusted, is 5.5 percent \u2014 one-tenth of a percentage point above the national average. It was well above 6 percent earlier this year.\n\nDuring recent Seattle City Council candidate forums, questioning has centered on a single issue above all others: The rising cost of housing in a city that is booming and where people want to live. The housing task force named by Mayor Ed Murray is due to deliver its recommendations next month.\n\nKing and Snohomish are the state\u2019s only counties with unemployment below 4 percent. Neighboring Pierce County is at 6.2 percent.\n\nThree of the state\u2019s 39 counties \u2014 Whitman, Asotin and San Juan \u2014 have jobless rates lower than 5 percent. Other areas at or below the national average include Whatcom and Walla Walla counties, both at 5.4 percent.\n\nThe technology economy is driving the state\u2019s most prosperous areas.\n\nBy contrast, the state\u2019s highest jobless figures come from counties dependent on the traditional resource economy, particularly timber harvesting.\n\nThe northeast corner of Washington remains its pocket of highest unemployment. With a jobless rate of 9.7 percent, Ferry County leads the state, with 8.6 percent unemployed in nearby Stevens and Pend Oreille counties.\n\nIn Southwest Washington, the unemployment rate in Grays Harbor County is 8.8 percent, with 8.4 percent jobless in Pacific County and 8.2 percent in Lewis County.\n\nIf the April figures are any indication, none of the economic calamities predicted by opponents of the $15-an-hour wage plans adopted by Seattle and SeaTac have come true.\n\nSeveral of the state\u2019s most prosperous counties \u2014 King, Snohomish, Whatcom, San Juan and Thurston \u2014 are among its most liberal voting areas. But conservative wheat-growing counties in Southeast Washington also have low unemployment.\n\nThe three hard-hit counties in Northeast Washington \u2014 Ferry, Stevens and Pend Oreille \u2014 have shown a higher-than-average dependence on social services. Yet, these areas are represented by the state\u2019s most conservative U.S. House member, Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, R-Wash., who has voted for deep cuts in social programs and vocally demanded repeal of the Affordable Care Act.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Strange Bedfellows -- Politics News", "description": "Seattle has recently relinquished its status as America\u2019s fastest-growing city \u2014 Austin, Texas takes the top spot \u2014\u00a0but the latest unemployment figures show that populous King and\u2026", "title": "Unemployment falls below 4 percent in King, Snohomish counties", "url": "http://blog.seattlepi.com/seattlepolitics/2015/05/26/unemployment-falls-below-4-percent-in-king-snohomish-counties/", "image": {"width": 448, "identifier": "http://blog.seattlepi.com/seattlepolitics/files/2011/03/472spacen3.jpg", "height": 304}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-27T00:52:09+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-27T01:33:16+00:00"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://blog.seattlepi.com/seattlepolitics/files/2011/03/472spacen3.jpg?w=640", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "NextGEN": "1.7.5", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "King and Snohomish are the state\u2019s only counties with unemployment below 4 percent.\nUnemployment in April was just 3.3 percent in King County and 3.6 percent in Snohomish County, according to figures from the state Employment Security Department.\nSeattle has recently relinquished its status as America\u2019s fastest-growing city \u2014 Austin, Texas takes the top spot \u2014 but the latest unemployment figures show that populous King and Snohomish counties are the economic engines driving Washington.\nSeveral of the state\u2019s most prosperous counties \u2014 King, Snohomish, Whatcom, San Juan and Thurston \u2014 are among its most liberal voting areas.\nKing County has reached its lowest jobless rate since April 2008, at the onset of the Great Recession."}
