Ted Cruz, have been a master class in concern trolling, but on Thursday Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) showed that he knows how to play the game, too.\n\nAccording to a statement released to the press, Reid extended an offer to his Republican counterparts: In a Senate where even broad agreement on an issue often isn\u2019t enough to bring it to the floor for a vote without an epic fight, he is offering Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and the Republican majority a freebie. Any time they want to bring GOP presidential frontrunner Donald Trump\u2019s policies to the floor of the Senate for a vote, he won\u2019t stand in the way.\n\nRelated: Cruz\u2019s Unreported $1 Million in Bank Loans Won\u2019t Help His Bid for President\n\nIn fact, he said, if McConnell doesn\u2019t bring Trump\u2019s immigration proposals up for a vote, the Democrats will try to do it for him.\n\n\u201cSince Republican leaders in the House and Senate have pledged loyalty to Trump, the obvious next step is to vote on his policies, including his unconstitutional plan to bar people from entering the United States based on their religion,\u201d Reid said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThese votes will give all Senators a chance to take a stand on the policy issues dominating the public debate \u2013 and Republicans a chance to stand with the front-runner for their nomination,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd, in a dig at McConnell, he added, \u201cScheduling the votes can be done easily and efficiently under an open amendment process, with no interference to the light workload Senate Republican leaders have announced for 2016.\u201d\n\nRelated: Is Nikki Haley Hitching Her Wagon to Lone Star Ted Cruz?\n\nShould Senate leaders decide they aren\u2019t interested, Reid promised, \u201cDemocrats will hold Republicans accountable by seeking floor votes on Trump\u2019s policies ourselves.\u201d\n\nMcConnell, who made an appearance before the media at the congressional Republicans\u2019 policy retreat in Maryland Thursday morning, didn\u2019t express much willingness to vote on Trump\u2019s policies, but did promise retaliation if Democrats try to force his members to take uncomfortable votes.\n\n\u201cGenerally speaking I\u2019ve tried to avoid turning the Senate into a studio for the presidential campaign but it\u2019s worth noting that what\u2019s good for the goose is good for the gander,\u201d the Kentuckian said. \u201cAnd so you could expect amendments that they might not like\u2019 related to the Sanders or Clinton campaigns. But as a general rule what I\u2019ve tried to ask the Senate to do is let the presidential candidates run their race and let\u2019s try to do the peoples\u2019 business.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The real estate billionaire\u2019s expressions of worry about the citizenship status of his chief rival, Canadian-born Sen.
