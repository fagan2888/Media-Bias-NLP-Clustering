In complete honesty, while I recognize him as one of the most influential and consequential politicians of my lifetime, I also find Cheney, or at least the version of him I experience through the media, to be rather dull. He\u2019s clearly intelligent and strong-willed; but he\u2019s also myopic and rigid. And despite having quit public office and decamped to Wyoming years ago, he still speaks in the pallid, clich\u00e9d and euphemistic language of the national security state bureaucracy, as if he never really left.\n\nDue to his essential flatness, his basic lack of introspection and total absence of doubt, Cheney is not the kind of figure who, after a fall from grace, is usually described as tragic or Shakespearean. He\u2019s more Iago than Macbeth. Yet as I read his lengthy interview with James Rosen in Playboy this week, the former vice president\u2019s answers kept reminding me of one of the iconic lines from \u201cHamlet,\u201d arguably Shakespeare\u2019s greatest tragedy. During the conversation, he tells Rosen, as he\u2019s told others before, that he does not regret his war crimes or care about how he\u2019ll be judged by history. But as Queen Gertrude might say, Richard Bruce Cheney doth protest too much.\n\nThe most obvious sign that Cheney is either lying to Rosen or himself \u2014 or, most likely, both \u2014 is the simple fact that he\u2019s doing the interview in the first place. Indeed, after spending most of his eight years in the White House endeavoring to shield his deeds and words from scrutiny, it seems lately that the once-taciturn vice president cannot shut up. Even more tellingly, it\u2019s not as if the now-loquacious Cheney is sharing his thoughts on the pressing issues of the day and his vision of the future. Somewhat comically, Rosen tries to get him to talk about \u201cthe digital revolution.\u201d But Cheney, like always, is much more interested in re-litigating the past, and laying down the narrative that revisionist historians of a conservative bent will no doubt cling to in the decades to come.\n\nWith the notable exception of GOP partisans, for example, most people today know that laying the blame for the chaos in Iraq entirely at President Obama\u2019s feet is ridiculous. After all, he\u2019s the man who famously described the U.S. invasion that set fire to Mesopotamia as \u201crash\u201d and \u201cdumb.\u201d But people in the future, who won\u2019t count the years of the Iraq War among their personal memories, will read Cheney\u2019s claim that ISIS rose because of Obama\u2019s \u201cprecipitous withdrawal\u201d and be none the wiser. There are two sides to every story, people will eventually say. And Cheney will, to some degree, escape from having ISIS hung around his neck.\n\nCheney\u2019s no less concerned with protecting his legacy when it comes to his other major crime as vice president: the construction of a global apparatus of systematic torture. As he did before when the reports to the contrary surfaced, Cheney insists to Rosen that President George W. Bush was briefed about torture and was fully in the know. \u201cI can remember sitting in the Oval Office \u2026 where we talked about the techniques,\u201d Cheney says. \u201cI mean, we were not trying to hide it from the president,\u201d he continues. But while it\u2019s highly likely that Bush knew something nasty was happening \u201cin the shadows,\u201d he has all the incentive in the world to shift some of the blame for these war crimes off his shoulders and onto others\u2019.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Cheney is full of it when he says he doesn't think about his legacy.
