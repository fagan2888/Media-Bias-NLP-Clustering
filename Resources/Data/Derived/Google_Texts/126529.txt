One Congressman is finding the whole government shutdown to be a total snoozefest.

Rep. George Holding was caught napping Thursday while he presided over a House session, as his Republican colleague Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-Texas) launched a passionate protest against Obamacare.

The Texan's soft-spoken drawl must have been a soothing sound to the North Carolina Republican, who rested his head in his hand to catch up on some shuteye during Gohmert's nearly 45-minute speech.

Gohmert's oratory display was the final act of the House session Thursday.

House debate was halted earlier in the day as the Capitol went into lockdown when a woman tried to drive through a barricade outside the building.

Friday marks day four of the government shutdown.
