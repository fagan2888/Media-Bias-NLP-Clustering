There are may ways to do so,\" he said.\n\nHe added that the BOJ has room to cut rates deeper into negative territory. Despite already gobbling up massive amounts of government bonds, the BOJ did not face any technical limitation of continuing its large-scale purchases, Kuroda said.\n\n\"Of course if we purchase all existing JGBs, then there's no way to purchase more. But there's a long way to go,\" he said.\n\n(Reporting by Leika Kihara; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said the central bank was", "title": "BOJ has 'many ways' to ease as price expectations weaken: Kuroda", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/13/BOJ-has-many-ways-ease-policy-further-Kuroda", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/japan-economy-boj_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/13/BOJ-has-many-ways-ease-policy-further-Kuroda", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/japan-economy-boj_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said the central bank was", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "While maintaining his optimistic view of Japan's economic outlook, Kuroda acknowledged that inflation expectations - key to the success of his massive monetary stimulus program - have been weakening in recent months.\n\"I can clearly say that our monetary policy ... isn't targeted at exchange rates,\" he said on Wednesday at a seminar hosted by Columbia University.\nKuroda countered the view, held by critics of his radical monetary experiment, that the decision to deploy negative rates was a sign the BOJ has exhausted its monetary policy tools.\n\"If there is any risk of declining inflation expectations affecting achievement of our price target ... we won't hesitate to further ease monetary conditions,\" he said, signaling the BOJ's readiness to ease again as early as this month.\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said the central bank was ready to expand monetary stimulus again if recent weaknesses in inflation expectations persist, stressing that there are \"many ways\" to do so to achieve his ambitious price target."}
