Advertisement\n\n\n\nTwenty-two years ago, my life was in the toilet. I was separated from my wife, and I was binge drinking nearly every weekend. My daughters were grown, so my sense of purpose as a father was no longer the raison d\u2019etre it had once been. The genetic predisposition that made me vulnerable to the disease of alcoholism was asserting itself with full force. More than once, I\u2019d tried to quit drinking on my own, pouring my booze stash down the sink only to find myself replacing it within a few weeks.\n\nAnd then I hit \u201cbottom,\u201d the word recovering alcoholics use to describe the lowest point in their personal battle with booze. Alcoholics aren\u2019t supposed to talk about their relationship with Alcoholics Anonymous at the level of print, but I am compelled to forego anonymity once more because of an article in the current Atlantic Monthly, a reprehensible bit of \u201cjournalism\u201d that targets AA as a \u201cfalse gospel.\u201d\n\nWriter Gabrielle Glaser, in an entirely sleazy article, strings together anecdotal \u201cevidence\u201d and dubious alternatives to show that AA doesn\u2019t work, principally because of the central tenet that one must believe in a Higher Power in order to be healed.\n\nI\u2019m an agnostic, but I have 21 years of sobriety. I owe those years to the fellowship of AA. I spent my early days of recovery wanting to debate the existence of God, to turn treatment of my disease into a series of sophomore-level bullshit sessions. But I got past that to find AA the most accepting and nurturing source of help available to anyone who suffers the affliction of chemical dependency.\n\nThe article in the Atlantic is reprehensible and irresponsible, mostly because it will give some people who are in dire need of help an excuse to eschew the most efficacious help out there. The woman who wrote the piece reveals her agenda in the closing paragraph when she quotes a psychologist on the subject. Speaking of the benefits available under provisions of Obamacare, he says: \u201cThis is going to be a mandated benefit, and insurance companies are going to want to pay for things that work.\u201d\n\nPrivate enterprise exploiters of human misery in the private sector are lining up to cash in on those benefits. Alcoholics Anonymous is a barrier to some of that profiteering because AA is free, and it works if you work it.", "article_metadata": {"Rating": "General", "description": "By Jaime O'Neill.
