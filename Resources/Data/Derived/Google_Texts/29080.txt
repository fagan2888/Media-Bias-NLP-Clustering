Just two customers remain without electricity out of 2,440 who lost power earlier on Tucson's southeast side.

The outage, which began just after 3 p.m., affected customers roughly to the southeast of South Houghton and East Irvington roads.

A Tucson Electric Power Co. crew has been on scene and trying to determine the cause. It may be due to the failure of an underground cable, according to Joseph Barrios, a TEP spokesman. He said he had not heard anything about a possible connection to a motorcycle crash that happened in the area around the same time.

Tucson Police Department Sgt. Pete Dugan said the crash does not appear to have caused an outage. That happened just down the road, at South Houghton and East Bilby roads, sending the motorcycle driver and a passenger to the hospital with non-life-threatening injuries.
