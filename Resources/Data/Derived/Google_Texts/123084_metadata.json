While there were actually things he could have been doing about it (such as nominating people for Federal Reserve Board vacancies and pushing for confirmation), mostly he was playing defense, and at best good bargaining with the House would only make marginal differences.\n\nThat\u2019s exactly the environment in which White House staff and campaign operatives are tempted to Do Something! Indeed, it was at about that point in 1979 that Jimmy Carter performed perhaps the ultimate in Do Something!, asking his entire Cabinet for their resignations and accepting five of them. One of the differences between the mostly competent Obama administration and the mostly not Carter was that the latter actually acted on this impulse.\n\nOf course, the press is always there to urge them on. Presidents, after all, are supposed to Lead. They\u2019re supposed to take Bold, Decisive Moves. Never mind whether those moves make any sense or not; very few traditional pundits urge presidents to be prudent.\n\nAs it happens, dumping a V.P. is about the most foolish thing a president can do. Well, I suppose on the assumption that said V.P. isn\u2019t Spiro Agnew and there\u2019s no evidence of him taking comic-style bags of cash with big dollar signs on them in exchange for political favors.\n\nWhy? Because, as John Sides reminds us, vice-presidents have very little effect on vote choice. That\u2019s not surprising, actually; political scientists generally have found that presidential candidates really don\u2019t have all that large an effect on vote choice. Most people vote based on party, in the first place, and beyond that on a general sense of how things have been going in the nation (rewarding the in-party, especially incumbents, when times are good, and punishing them when times are bad). All the rest of it \u2013 personal traits of the candidates, electioneering, specific issues \u2013 can move the needle a little, so it\u2019s worth it for a campaign to do what it can, but in most cases it more or less cancels out. Given all that, what are the odds that a vice-president would have any important independent effect?
