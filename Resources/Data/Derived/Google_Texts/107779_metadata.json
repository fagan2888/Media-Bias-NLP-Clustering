It featured clips of Prince performing on the comedy show over the past four decades and skits with former cast member Fred Armisen portraying the artist.\n\nThe show also included a video of Prince's impromptu performance at an after-party following the show's 40th anniversary special last year, where Prince sang \"Let's Go Crazy\" on a small stage alongside Fallon, fellow SNL vets Chris Rock, Maya Rudolph, Martin Short and other celebrities.\n\nThe 57-year-old music icon died Thursday at his Paisley Park compound in suburban Minneapolis. An autopsy was done Friday but no cause has been announced.\n\nThe tribute show replaced a scheduled SNL rerun.\n\n___\n\nOnline:\n\nhttp://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live", "article_metadata": {"description": "'Saturday Night Live' airs Prince tribute show - AP News: NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 NBC's \"Saturday Night Live\" has aired .05/26/2016 10:38:56AM EST.", "author": "AP News", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 NBC's \"Saturday Night Live\" has aired a special tribute show titled", "title": "AP News - 'Saturday Night Live' airs Prince tribute show", "url": "http://townhall.com/news/entertainment/2016/04/24/saturday-night-live-devotes-entire-show-to-prince-tribute-n2152976", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016\\115\\5e70d2fd-eeae-4c69-a61d-7b9eb19ddb19.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 NBC's \"Saturday Night Live\" has aired a special tribute show titled", "title": "AP News - 'Saturday Night Live' airs Prince tribute show", "url": "http://townhall.com/news/entertainment/2016/04/24/saturday-night-live-devotes-entire-show-to-prince-tribute-n2152976", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/115/5e70d2fd-eeae-4c69-a61d-7b9eb19ddb19.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "'Saturday Night Live' airs Prince tribute show, AP News, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0e20\"", "article_summary": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 NBC's \"Saturday Night Live\" has aired a special tribute show titled \"Goodnight Sweet Prince.\"\nIt featured clips of Prince performing on the comedy show over the past four decades and skits with former cast member Fred Armisen portraying the artist.\nThe tribute show replaced a scheduled SNL rerun.\n\"Tonight Show\" host and SNL alum Jimmy Fallon hosted the episode.\nThe 57-year-old music icon died Thursday at his Paisley Park compound in suburban Minneapolis."}
