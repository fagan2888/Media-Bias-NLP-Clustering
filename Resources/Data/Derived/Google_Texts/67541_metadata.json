Clarke, a former White House counterterrorism adviser who served on the panel. \u201cI don\u2019t think it can be. In any outcome here, he\u2019s going to serve time. The only question here is how much.\u201d\n\nAs the debate plays out, Mr. Snowden watches from refuge in Moscow, where he fled last year after turning over classified documents to journalists from The Guardian and The Washington Post. Even after a lengthy interview published by The Post last month, little is known of his current life beyond his self-description as an \u201cinside cat\u201d who survives on ramen noodles and entertains sympathetic visitors but does not read the books they bring him.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Snowden claimed vindication last month after a judge ruled against the legality of a telephone metadata collection program detailed in the documents he disclosed. Another judge took the opposite position, but the conflict suggests that the matter is not as cut-and-dried as the government asserts, Mr. Snowden\u2019s advocates said. The White House panel found \u201cpersistent instances of noncompliance\u201d by the security agency but no \u201cillegality or other abuse of authority\u201d targeting domestic political activity.\n\nMr. Snowden\u2019s disclosures are protected by the First Amendment, said Bruce Fein, a former Reagan administration lawyer who at one point represented Mr. Snowden's father. \u201cIt prohibits government from punishing communications that expose government lawlessness whether or not the illegality is classified,\u201d he said. \u201cCalling government to account for breaking the law is a compelling civic duty of all citizens.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe amnesty idea won widespread attention last month when Richard Ledgett, who leads an N.S.A. task force evaluating damage from the disclosures, said on the CBS News program \u201c60 Minutes\u201d that it was \u201cworth having a conversation about\u201d it to prevent further revelations.\n\nThat position won further attention in the last week with editorials in The Guardian and The New York Times urging clemency. (The editorial page of The Times is run independently of the news department.) Debates about the idea played out on CNN, ABC and elsewhere, and Anne-Marie Slaughter, a former State Department official in the Obama administration, posted a message on Twitter in favor of clemency.\n\nBut inside the White House and the Justice Department, Mr. Ledgett\u2019s suggestion has been met with stony opposition. The administration has made no move to reach out to negotiate any kind of deal and makes clear that it has no plans to. Officials express nothing but antipathy for Mr. Snowden, whose disclosures, one argued, have caused Al Qaeda and its allies \u201cto change their tactics.\u201d\n\nUnder the Espionage Act, there is no whistle-blower defense that would allow Mr. Snowden to argue his innocence because he was justified in exposing wrongdoing. Such an argument might be raised at sentencing, but Mr. Snowden\u2019s supporters are focused on the court of public opinion, portraying him as a hero.\n\n\u201cThe irony is the Obama administration welcomes the debate but condemns the man who sparked the debate,\u201d said Anthony D. Romero, the executive director of the A.C.L.U. \u201cThe debate would never have happened but for Edward Snowden.\u201d\n\nMichael B. Mukasey, an attorney general under President George W. Bush, said that theoretically noble motives were no excuse. \u201cThe only lesson if he doesn\u2019t get prosecuted will be that if you commit a crime, take hostages \u2014 whether people or information \u2014 that you can use to negotiate your freedom,\u201d he said.\n\nJohn D. Negroponte, a former director of national intelligence, said any changes to the programs would be relatively minor. \u201cWhether it\u2019s tweaked \u2014 and that\u2019s what it\u2019s going to be, tweaked \u2014 it doesn\u2019t justify what Mr. Snowden did,\u201d he said.\n\nAmong those who want to change the program are the five members of Mr. Obama\u2019s review panel. Three opposed leniency for Mr. Snowden, including Mr. Clarke; Geoffrey R. Stone, a University of Chicago law professor; and Michael J. Morell, a former acting director of the C.I.A.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cEven if Snowden\u2019s benefit outweighed his costs, you don\u2019t want to encourage people to make this decision for themselves,\u201d Mr. Stone said.\n\nThe other two panel members, Cass R. Sunstein and Peter Swire, took no public position. But Mr. Swire said the debate underscored how much the surveillance had polarized the country.\n\n\u201cOne Silicon Valley person I spoke to on the question of whistle-blower versus traitor, his estimate was over 90 percent of the people in his company would say whistle-blower,\u201d said Mr. Swire, a professor at Georgia Tech. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve met a person in the intelligence community who would say whistle-blower. This is one of the biggest left coast-right coast splits we\u2019ve seen.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140104141335, "twitter": {"description": "The whistleblower-versus-traitor argument has taken on a new dimension with recent moves to curtail the programs that Edward J.
