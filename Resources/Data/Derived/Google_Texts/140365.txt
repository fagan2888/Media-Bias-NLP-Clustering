The payment represents a 45 percent increase from the $2,750 UAW-represented employees received last year, the company said.

The company said the hike in profit sharing was a result of the company's 2015 financial performance.

Fiat earlier in the day reported a better-than-expected quarterly performance in North America, the region that accounted for 85 percent of the company's 2015 profit.

The Italian-U.S. automaker said about 40,000 of its employees would receive the payment on Feb. 19.

Fiat Chrysler employed a total of 85,521 hourly and salaried workers as of Dec. 31, 2014 in North America.
