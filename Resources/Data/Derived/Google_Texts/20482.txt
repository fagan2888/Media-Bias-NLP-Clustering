Before it goes back on the grill...

He intentionally dropped the filet onto the floor. Then he picked it up, put it back on the grill for a couple minutes and then sent it back out to the customer.”

I worked at an extremely popular Jersey shore restaurant for 9 summers during the 1970s. It had to then be one of the most expensive restaurants in NJ.



Starting as potwasher, I exhibited enough talent and drive so that at the end of my second summer, after time as dishwasher, prep cook, salad chef and fry guy (no pretense of chef for the fry guy), I was promoted to swing chef, working the other chefs’ jobs on their nights off. And so I was working as saute chef one night next to the head chef, who worked the grill and cooked all of the beef on the menu. All of the chefs, in white coats and chef hats, were visible to the dining room.

A waitress brought back a filet mignon because the customer had ordered it medium and thought it undercooked. With a knife the head chef confirmed it had been properly cooked medium. As he lifted the filet off the plate with a spatula to put it back on the grill, he turned to me and said, “But before it goes back on the grill, first it goes...on the floor.” And he intentionally dropped the filet onto the floor. Then he picked it up, put it back on the grill for a couple minutes and then sent it back out to the customer.

I was appalled at the head chef’s show of utter contempt for our customers, although I did not say anything to him because he was my boss. But over the thousands of restaurant meals I’ve eaten in the decades since then, I have never complained about any food item unless there is something objectively wrong with it.
