It included this telling sentence:\n\n\"A reporter for Britain\u2019s Telegraph newspaper in Paris told Sky News that the first two officers to arrive, who were apparently unarmed, fled after seeing gunmen armed with automatic weapons and possibly a grenade launcher.\"\n\nEvery American, every citizen of a free country, needs to read, and re-read that sentence. Here is the answer of liberals and socialists to the problem of domestic security. Let the police do it. Let the state protect you. Give all weapons to the professionals who are trained and who can be trusted.\n\nWe see how much New York Mayor Bill de Blasio trusts his own police department. He treats them as if they are the problem in minority communities. They are the ones who must be re-trained and restrained. It is not, for de Blasio, a case of police protecting people in crime-ridden neighborhoods where fatherless young men shoot each other, and all too often get into conflicts with the police. No, for de Blasio\u2014and all his fellow socialists\u2014the police are the problem. It is small wonder that police officers turn their backs on de Blasio when he has the temerity to speak at funerals for police officers assassinated in the line of duty. And it is not surprising that they engage in a rule-book slowdown to make their displeasure with his disrespect known.\n\nBut this whole scene presents leftists worldwide with a conundrum. Surrender all means of self-defense, they tell us, to the state. We will make sure we are surrounded by security, but for you and your family we will arm only those outnumbered uniformed police whom we don\u2019t really trust ourselves.\n\nI write not to indict the Paris police who arrived, other reports have it, on bicycles. If unarmed, if on bikes, they faced terrorists who were mistaken by passersby on the Paris streets for a highly-trained military swat team. That\u2019s not surprising for that is exactly what they were. Except they were trained to act out murderously against France\u2019s democracy and not for it.\n\nCNN\u2019s Jake Tapper spoke for millions of us when he said he was \u201cashamed\u201d by the Missing in Action list of top American officials who failed to show for the massive solidarity march in Paris this weekend.\n\nPresident Obama skipped the march. So did Vice President Biden. So did Sec. of State John Kerry. So did outgoing Attorney General Eric Holder. Holder was in Paris at the time and made time for five\u2014count `em\u2014five Sunday talk shows, but could he not put in an appearance at the march.\n\n\u201cWorld Leaders Link Arms,\u201d headlined the Washington Post in Monday\u2019s edition. But no U.S. leader joined the march. Unless we count the U.S. Ambassador to France. Amb. Jane Hartley is doubtless a capable person. She might even be fluent in French. But, be honest, until this weekend, did you even know her name?\n\nSecretary of State John Kerry is headed to France. He is fluent in French. Maybe he can explain to the people of France why the U.S. went unrepresented in their hour of agony. He dismissed all criticism of the Obama administration as \u201cmere quibbling.\u201d To the rest of the world, the U.S. absence was attributed to \u201csecurity concerns.\u201d Does that not sound like rank cowardice? Surely, the heads of the British, French, and German governments had to consider security arrangements for the march. But they marched anyway.\n\nSecurity concerns did not keep Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu away. He may be the prime target in the world. Those French citizens at the offices of the satirical magazine, Charlie Hebdo, likely included, and the customers at the Kosher deli surely included French Jews. They were attacked no doubt because they were Jews. And yet Benjamin Netanyahu not only joined the line of march, he also spoke brave words at Paris\u2019s Grand Synagogue.\n\nIt is indeed shameful that as Commander-in-Chief of the world\u2019s greatest military, President Obama could not join the world leaders who marched in Paris. Or, at least he might have sent Vice President Joe Biden. Surely, Joe Biden has to be more than just impeachment insurance.\n\nFundamentally, though, the real message in last week\u2019s attack is this: Only an armed people can be a free people. Only a people who have the means to defend themselves can enjoy the blessings of liberty. If your government fears to let you defend yourself, change your government.\n\nWhen John Kerry arrives in Paris, he doubtless knows that France lacks a Second Amendment. But France has a National Anthem, the Marseillaise. And a memorable line in that stirring song is: Aux armes, concitoyens! To arms, Fellow Citizens!\n\nNow is the time to put self-defense on the international agenda. If your government does not believe in the right to keep and bear arms as a human right, then it probably doesn\u2019t believe in your right to life, either.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"A reporter for Britains Telegraph newspaper in Paris told Sky News that the first two officers to arrive, who were apparently unarmed, fled after seeing gunmen armed with automatic weapons and possibly a grenade launcher.\".05/25/2016 17:55:47PM EST.", "author": "Ken Blackwell", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "\"A reporter for Britains Telegraph newspaper in Paris told Sky News that the first two officers to arrive, who were apparently unarmed, fled after seeing gunmen armed with automatic weapons and possibly a grenade launcher.\"", "title": "- France Needs a Second Amendment\u2014And so do We!", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/kenblackwell/2015/01/14/france-needs-a-second-amendmentand-so-do-we-n1943111", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/13/1cb65482-ff30-47fe-9358-7498fdc0e7de.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "\"A reporter for Britains Telegraph newspaper in Paris told Sky News that the first two officers to arrive, who were apparently unarmed, fled after seeing gunmen armed with automatic weapons and possibly a grenade launcher.\"", "title": "- France Needs a Second Amendment\u2014And so do We!", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/kenblackwell/2015/01/14/france-needs-a-second-amendmentand-so-do-we-n1943111", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/13/1cb65482-ff30-47fe-9358-7498fdc0e7de.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "France Needs a Second Amendment\u2014And so do We!, Ken Blackwell, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddff3\"", "article_summary": "When John Kerry arrives in Paris, he doubtless knows that France lacks a Second Amendment.\nMaybe he can explain to the people of France why the U.S. went unrepresented in their hour of agony.\nEvery American, every citizen of a free country, needs to read, and re-read that sentence.\nSurely, the heads of the British, French, and German governments had to consider security arrangements for the march.\nAnd it is not surprising that they engage in a rule-book slowdown to make their displeasure with his disrespect known."}
