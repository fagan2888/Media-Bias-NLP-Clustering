This is an alarming statistic, because it drives home how much ordinary Americans lack access to jobs and health insurance, and how women of reproductive age, particularly those in their 20s, are hard hit by an economy in which it is increasingly difficult to pull oneself out of poverty.\n\nAmanda Marcotte Amanda Marcotte is writer for Salon.\n\n\n\nIt also serves as a reminder of the high social cost of creating obstacles to affordable contraception access, which leads to a rapidly escalating unintended pregnancy rate for lower-income women. While it's a good thing for mothers and babies that Medicaid help is available and, under Obamacare, will be even easier to get (at least as long as Democrats run your state), we should still be very concerned about how this statistic shows that the system is failing working-class Americans who want to build a better life for themselves and their children.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nOr we could just panic and paint women who use Medicaid assistance as wanton harlots in need of punishment for their sexy misdeeds. While the conservative response to these statistics is still in nascent form\u2014not quite polished enough yet to be thrown on a teleprompter in front of Bill O'Reilly\u2014anger at poor women for having babies is beginning to bubble up on the right.\n\nCatholic Online, a presumably stalwart anti-contraception publication, ran a fairly straightforward piece on the data, but it gave the piece the headline \"MEDICAID: How YOU are paying for all these births in the U.S.\" Loaves and fishes is one thing, but making sure that babies are born alive and healthy is just a step too far, apparently.\n\nKatie Pavlich, writing for Townhall, starts with the assumption that these births are \"out-of-wedlock,\" with fornicators \"busting state budgets all over the country\" while creating a \"vicious cycle of poverty and despair.\"\n\nBut what can be done? A brave op-ed columnist from the Springfield (Mo.) News Leader, John Lilly, is willing to come right and say it:\n\nPregnancy is a medical condition, but it\u2019s different from high blood pressure and diabetes since it is a condition that is dependent on a conscious decision the vast majority of the time.\n\nShould the taxpayer be forced to pay for the consequences of another\u2019s decision? Would you go door to door asking for money for your pregnancy? Maybe we could start by limiting the number of births paid for by Medicaid to one as a transition to none.", "article_metadata": {"fb-share": "Half of American Births Are Covered by Medicaid.
