Among them was Sinthanouxay Khottavongsa, 57, who was \u201cholding a crowbar in a threatening manner,\u201d police said. Officers told Khottavongsa repeatedly to drop the crowbar before using a Taser on him.\n\nKhottavongsa then fell to the ground and struck his head. He was transported to North Memorial Medical Center and died two days later from what was described by the county medical examiner's office as \u201ccomplications of blunt force head injury.\u201d\n\nPolice and the Hennepin County Sheriff\u2019s Office would not comment further on the incident, citing the active investigation. An incident report was not available.\n\nThe mayors of both Minneapolis and St. Paul have taken public steps to address the smoldering issue of police-civilian relations.\n\nSt. Paul Mayor Chris Coleman recently agreed to ask outside auditors to review the police-civilian board, which investigates citizen complaints against officers.\n\nThat move was prompted by an incident last year in St. Paul involving police use of a stun gun that was caught on video and made national news. Three officers used a Taser on Chris Lollie after they confronted him sitting in a skyway lounge before picking up his kids at day care. Lollie agreed to leave the lounge, but was followed by officers. The altercation ended in his arrest. Charges against Lollie were dropped and the officers exonerated of improper conduct.\n\nMinneapolis Mayor Betsy Hodges has been vocally supportive of the police chief\u2019s efforts to monitor police behavior with the use of officer body cameras.\n\nAccording to KMSP-TV news reports, Khottavongsa was a father of three children and was active in his community as a volunteer and handyman. Originally from Laos, he came to the U.S. in the 1970s, arriving first in Texas where he gained his citizenship before relocating to Minnesota. His family said Khottavongsa was at the auto body shop helping a friend do some repair work at the time of the incident.\n\nPublic records indicate he was married to Khamla Khottavongsa, 57. His family declined to comment Saturday, but a gofundme.com page set up to raise money for funeral costs describes Khottavongsa as \u201ca compassionate and generous person.\u201d\n\nThe website continues, \u201cThose who knew him best also remember him as a selfless, caring, and loving individual. He was always willing to lend a helping hand. He worked very hard to help and serve not only his family, but whomever came into his life.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "&nbsp;.", "title": "Authorities investigate death of man after Brooklyn Center police used Taser", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/authorities-investigate-death-of-man-after-brooklyn-center-police-used-taser/289678581/", "image": {"url": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201091", "width": 1680, "identifier": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201091", "height": 876}, "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "twitter": {"description": "&nbsp;.", "title": "Authorities investigate death of man after Brooklyn Center police used Taser", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/authorities-investigate-death-of-man-after-brooklyn-center-police-used-taser/289678581/", "image": {"src": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201091", "identifier": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201091"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "description": "&nbsp;."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfcb1\"", "article_summary": "Hennepin County is investigating the death of a St. Paul man who hit his head on the ground after Brooklyn Center police used a Taser on him.\nThe mayors of both Minneapolis and St. Paul have taken public steps to address the smoldering issue of police-civilian relations.\nSt. Paul Mayor Chris Coleman recently agreed to ask outside auditors to review the police-civilian board, which investigates citizen complaints against officers.\nThree officers used a Taser on Chris Lollie after they confronted him sitting in a skyway lounge before picking up his kids at day care.\nOfficers told Khottavongsa repeatedly to drop the crowbar before using a Taser on him."}
