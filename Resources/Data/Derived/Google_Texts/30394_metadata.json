The pipeline is expected to be fixed in 24 hours, Rosneft said.\n\nBrent futures, the global benchmark for crude, were up 11 cents at 37.04 a barrel by 11:24 a.m. (1624 GMT) after plumbing a session low at $36.35.\n\nU.S. crude futures rose 30 cents to $34.96, against its intraday low of $34.19.\n\n\"Crude seems to be increasingly discounting bearish news and data including rapidly rising inventory levels,\" said Vikas Dwivedi, analyst at Macquarie Capital. \"Market fundamentals, in our view, suggest the rally is too early, and we expect crude to retrace to the $30 per barrel range.\"\n\nIn under two months, Brent and U.S. crude futures have gained about $10, or around 30 percent, a barrel from 12-year lows of between $26 and $27.\n\nThe rally has been fueled by pledges from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to work with other major oil producers to freeze production at January's highs.\n\nData from market intelligence provider Genscape suggested stockpiles at the main delivery hub for U.S. crude futures have risen to a new peak above the record high the government reported on Wednesday, traders who saw the data said.\n\nGenscape's data showed Cushing stockpiles rose 1.1 million barrels to 68.7 million barrels during the week to March 1, above the 66.3 million barrels in the U.S. government data for week ending Feb. 26. [EIA/S]\n\nU.S. crude stockpiles as a whole rose 10.4 million barrels to an all-time high of 517.98 million barrels last week, government data showed.
