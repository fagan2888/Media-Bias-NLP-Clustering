And the decision was to go ahead and make the switch because we think we can eradicate polio. This is a huge step towards that,\" the chairman of the group, Jon Abramson, said on Friday.\n\nThe world has only once managed to eliminate a disease, which was smallpox, but now was the time \u201cto pull the trigger and go for polio eradication\u201d, Abramson said.\n\nA global vaccination campaign has all but beaten all three types of the wild polio virus, with only Pakistan and Afghanistan reporting cases this year.\n\nBut people who are vaccinated excrete the virus, putting those who have not been vaccinated at risk of catching it. Vaccine-derived cases have recently popped up in places with low vaccine coverage, such as Laos, Ukraine, Madagascar and Guinea.\n\n\"We want to stop that small number of type 2 that occurs in outbreaks,\" said Abramson. \"When we\u2019re not giving type 2 (vaccinations) you\u2019re not going to see those outbreaks.\"\n\nHamid Jafari, director of polio eradication at the WHO, said the eventual goal was to phase out the type 1 and type 3 vaccines as well and to switch globally to \"inactivated\" vaccines, which are more costly and need to be injected rather than swallowed, but don't carry the risk of spreading the virus.\n\n\"We need at least three years of no wild polio virus circulation and good surveillance for the Global Commission (for the Certification of Poliomyelitis Eradication) to certify eradication of wild polio virus,\" he said.\n\n\"We haven\u2019t seen type 3 wildtype in over three years. Hopefully very soon we will stop seeing wildtype type 1,\" Abramson said.\n\nThe group that he chairs, the WHO's Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE), recommends global immunization policies to the U.N. health agency.\n\n(Editing by Gareth Jones)", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "who, experts, signal, victory, over, one, three, polio, strains", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "The World Health Organization now recommends switching to a polio vaccine that only targets types 1 and 3, as type 2 has not been detected since 1999.", "title": "WHO Experts Signal Victory Over One Of Three Polio Strains", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/who-experts-signal-victory-over-one-three-polio-strains-358790", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/10/24/polio.JPG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The World Health Organization now recommends switching to a polio vaccine that only targets types 1 and 3, as type 2 has not been detected since 1999.", "title": "WHO Experts Signal Victory Over One Of Three Polio Strains", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/who-experts-signal-victory-over-one-three-polio-strains-358790", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/10/24/polio.JPG", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/10/24/polio.JPG"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-10-24T10:55:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-24T10:54:59-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "The World Health Organization now recommends switching to a polio vaccine that only targets types 1 and 3, as type 2 has not been detected since 1999."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcac92\"", "article_summary": "\"We need at least three years of no wild polio virus circulation and good surveillance for the Global Commission (for the Certification of Poliomyelitis Eradication) to certify eradication of wild polio virus,\" he said.\nA global vaccination campaign has all but beaten all three types of the wild polio virus, with only Pakistan and Afghanistan reporting cases this year.\nCurrently, the primary tool against the disease is an oral vaccine, which zaps all three types of polio.\nThere is no cure for polio, which attacks the nervous system and can cause irreversible paralysis within hours of infection.\nThe world has only once managed to eliminate a disease, which was smallpox, but now was the time \u201cto pull the trigger and go for polio eradication\u201d, Abramson said."}
