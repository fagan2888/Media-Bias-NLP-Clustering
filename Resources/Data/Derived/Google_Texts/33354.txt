INDIANAPOLIS — Robotic about his pregame routine, Peyton Manning took off his helmet and let the large crowd see that he is a human being first, a quarterback second.

A video tribute of Manning’s career in Indianapolis played on the Lucas Oil Stadium jumbo screens Sunday night. In the footage, he was wearing a Colts uniform, throwing touchdown passes to Marvin Harrison, Reggie Wayne and Brandon Stokley.

Manning was wearing a white Broncos uniform as the emotional tribute played. He was a Colts quarterback for 14 seasons, a Broncos quarterback going on season No. 2.

The video was played a couple minutes before the game’s opening kickoff, and Manning warmed up his right arm as usual. Between throws, though, he looked up at one of the screens.

He didn’t want to disrespect the Indianapolis fans by ignoring his tribute.

Near the end of the video, which was about a minute long, the highlights showed Manning standing on the midfield podium in a driving Miami rain after winning Super Bowl XLI on Feb. 4, 2007. He hoisted the Vince Lombardi Trophy as the rain poured.

Colts fans roared their approval Sunday night. The tribute ended with the screen fading to Colts blue and this message: “Thank You, Peyton.”

It held there a few seconds as the sellout crowd cheered. Manning took off his helmet with his right hand and waved to the crowd with his left hand. He looked into the crowd and said, “Thank you, thank you very much,” several times while nodding to his former hometown fans.

After taking 15 to 20 seconds to acknowledge the cheers, Manning put on his helmet and moved toward his sideline. The visiting sideline. Denver’s sideline. It was time for the game to kick off.
