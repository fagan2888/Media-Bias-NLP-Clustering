A glitch? A hoax? Or worse, another viral marketing campaign? The computer security researchers who happened across the Lorem Ipsum Google Translate mystery, weren\u2019t sure. And before they figured it out, the hidden messages suddenly stopped.\n\nLorem Ipsum is placeholder text used in templates, mock-ups of web-pages, and typesetting in general. It\u2019s typically made up of a section from Roman philosopher Cicero\u2019s tract on good and evil De finibus bonorum at malorum, with Latin words added and removed so that its meaning becomes jibberish. It made the news recently showing up on buggy Affordable Care Act webpages.\n\nBut even more recently, just a couple months ago, a cyber-security researcher who wants to be identified only as \"Kraeh3n\" was proofreading a document for a colleague that featured some normal Lorem Ipsum filler text when she noticed something peculiar. Google Translate was auto-detecting the Latin and translating \"lorem ipsum\" into the English word \u201cChina.\u201d\n\nKraeh3n started seeing other words too, like \u201cInternet,\u201d \u201cgovernment,\u201d \u201cpolice,\u201d and \u201cfreedom\u201d and immediately contacted another researcher, Michael Shoukry. The two played around with putting different combinations of the two words lorem and ipsum capitalized and uncapitalized into Google Translate, to similarly strange results.\n\nVariations on 'Lorem ipsum' and their equivalents, until recently, in Google Translate. Image via Krebs on Security\n\nFor example, \u201clorem ipsum ipsum ipsum ipsum/Lorem ipsum ipsum ipsum lorem\u201d translated to: \u201cChina is the winner/Thank you to the Internet.\u201d Then they started experimenting by adding the Latin words \u201cdolor,\u201d \u201csit,\u201d and \u201cconsectetur,\u201d producing results like \u201cconsectetur Sit Sit Dolor\u201d translating to \u201cRussia May Be Suffering,\u201d and \u201cLorem Sit Sit Lorem\u201d to \u201cChina May Be Home.\u201d\n\nIn a way, the Lorem Ipsum mystery reveals our desire to read meaning into the meaningless.\n\nGoogle Translate works through crowdsourcing and hunting patterns in texts online that have already been translated by a human. For a language like Latin, there are fewer translated texts available and Google is likely to give more peculiar and buggy translations than for a more common language like French.\n\nKraeh3n, though, was convinced this was not mere glitch or coincidence but something intentional. She told Brian Krebs, a computer security writer who later blogged about the phenomenon, \u201cTranslate [is] designed to be able to evolve and to learn from crowd-sourced input to reflect adaptations in language use over time. Someone out there learned to game that ability and use an obscure piece of text no one in their right mind would ever type in to create totally random alternate meanings that could, potentially, be used to transmit messages covertly.\u201d\n\nAll the more suspicious, at least for the conspiracy-theorists at heart, is the fact that on August 16, Google Translate changed. Now, \u201clorem\u201d simply translated to \u201clorem.\u201d\n\nIn a way, the Lorem Ipsum mystery reveals our desire to read meaning into the meaningless. It\u2019s like a 21st-century Voynich Manuscript, the medieval book written in either code or jibberish that\u2019s vexed keen minds for centuries. Contemporary emporers thought the manuscript held alchemical secrets and elixir recipees, but they couldn\u2019t deciper its alien alphabet. Neither could the same WWII cryptographers who had no problem cracking enemy codes.\n\nAlthough it\u2019s debatable whether there is a real message in some unknown language or it\u2019s just a 600 year old hoax, amateur cryptographers who tend toward the Romantic and obsessive still try. \u201cAt the heart of the drive to decode the document,\u201d writes Reed Johnson, one such wannabe codecracker, \u201cis a deep and secret desire for transcendent meaning.\u201d That desire is strong in the drive to find some code within Lorem Ipsum too. It\u2019s just state secrets rather than alchemical ones that seem to capture our imaginations today. Unfortunately though, the mystery of Lorem Ipsum seems to have been solved.\n\nAccording to an update from Tech Crunch, the strange results on Google Translate were part of the Def Con badge puzzle contest, a cryptographic Easter egg hunt that hacker 1o57 puts on every summer as a part of the annual convention in Las Vegas. As laid out by recaps of the challenge, one of the steps in the cryptographic game was a Lorem Ipsum poem that when run through Google Translate was converted into: \u201cLet\u2019s see if/We give/Pussycat Dolls/The Free Love/It can be used/Our goal is to ame/Our goal is to/vehicle dimensions/Free of pain/China, elsewhere/Free Internet/China loves/NATO.\u201d\n\n'Pussycat Dolls' and 'NATO' were just clues in a scavenger hunt for cypherpunks.\n\nSince the challenge, this translation no longer works. Though it\u2019s unconfirmed how or whether 1o57 hacked Translate prior to the tournament\u2014so far he hasn\u2019t replied to my request for comment\u2014it seems that the hidden meanings in Lorem Ipsum were just part of the game. \u201cPussycat Dolls\u201d and \u201cNATO\u201d were just clues in a scavenger hunt for cypherpunks.\n\nAt the end of Cicero\u2019s text on good and evil that Lorem Ipsum bastardizes, the philosopher fails to come to a conclusion about what the best definition of good is\u2014is it the absence of pain? A virtuous life? Happiness? Although there wasn\u2019t any message or hidden code in the Lorem Ipsum translations beyond a jibberish poem, maybe there still is some meaning and a clue at the enigmatic concept of goodness in the very nature of the puzzle game it was a part of.\n\nThere isn\u2019t really a point to the game, although there\u2019s a point to decentralizing the skills the game uses. There\u2019s a point to these skills not being monopolized by centralized security agencies with nefarious aims. Maybe there\u2019s a message there about one idea of the nature of good and evil, bonorum at malorum, today. Or maybe, I\u2019m just likewise reading meaning into something meaningless.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://motherboard.vice.com/read/the-search-for-meaning-in-a-cryptic-google-translation", "twitter": {"twitter": "The Search for Meaning in a Cryptic Google Translation of Untranslatable Words", "image": "http://motherboard-images.vice.com/content-images/article/no-id/1408927282469887.jpeg", "description": "A cypherpunk game gives hope to Coast to Coast AM fans and others that 'want to believe.'", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@motherboard"}, "keywords": "mysteries, conspiracies, Google Translate, secrets, power, CIA", "sailthru.locale": "en_us", "sailthru.tags": "mysteries, conspiracies, Google Translate, secrets, power, CIA, MB, en_us, mben", "description": "A cypherpunk game gives hope to Coast to Coast AM fans and others that 'want to believe.'", "msapplication-TileColor": "#7974bd", "sailthru.title": "The Search for Meaning in a Cryptic Google Translation of Untranslatable Words", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/assets/favicons/motherboard/mstile-150x150.png?v", "thumbnail": "http://motherboard-images.vice.com/content-images/article/no-id/1408927282469887.jpeg", "news_keywords": "mysteries, conspiracies, Google Translate, secrets, power, CIA", "sailthru.expire_date": "2014-09-01", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/assets/favicons/motherboard/mstile-310x150.png?v", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/assets/favicons/motherboard/mstile-70x70.png?v", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/assets/favicons/motherboard/mstile-310x310.png?v", "msapplication-TileImage": "/assets/favicons/motherboard/mstile-144x144.png?v", "sailthru.description": "A cypherpunk game gives hope to Coast to Coast AM fans and others that 'want to believe.'", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "og": {"site_name": "Motherboard", "description": "A cypherpunk game gives hope to Coast to Coast AM fans and others that 'want to believe.'", "title": "The Search for Meaning in a Cryptic Google Translation of Untranslatable Words", "locale": "en_us", "image": "http://motherboard-images.vice.com/content-images/article/no-id/1408927282469887.jpeg", "url": "http://motherboard.vice.com/read/the-search-for-meaning-in-a-cryptic-google-translation", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-25 11:05:00"}, "type": "article"}, "sailthru.publish_date": "2014-08-25 11:05:00", "p": {"domain_verify": "eac54d01e7a940c4380d0105a2a58912"}, "sailthru.item_type": "article"}, "article_summary": "The computer security researchers who happened across the Lorem Ipsum Google Translate mystery, weren\u2019t sure.\nGoogle Translate works through crowdsourcing and hunting patterns in texts online that have already been translated by a human.\nNow, \u201clorem\u201d simply translated to \u201clorem.\u201dIn a way, the Lorem Ipsum mystery reveals our desire to read meaning into the meaningless.\nVariations on 'Lorem ipsum' and their equivalents, until recently, in Google Translate.\nThe two played around with putting different combinations of the two words lorem and ipsum capitalized and uncapitalized into Google Translate, to similarly strange results."}
