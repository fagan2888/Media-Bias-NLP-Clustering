(AP) \u2014 The owner of a North Dakota coffee shop is flattered his decision to operate the business on the honor system garnered international attention earlier this summer, but those who equate it to the goodness of all humanity might want to help themselves to a decaf K-Cup.\n\nDavid Brekke says it\u2019s about small-town living where people know their neighbors.\n\nBrekke and his wife, Kimberly, run The Vault coffee shop in Valley City, a town of about 6,700 people that\u2019s about 45 minutes from Fargo. They renovated a nearly 100-year-old bank building and cut down on overhead by cutting out baristas.\n\nThe food and drink is located on a refurbished teller counter at the front of the shop. Coffee lovers can choose java from a commercial brewer, complete with gourmet creams and flavorings, or individual servings from a Keurig brewing system, or K-Cups. There also are soft drinks and homemade pastries.\n\nThis unusual setup has given customers a sense of ownership, helped revitalize the city\u2019s downtown \u2014 and, in the first 10 months of the business, brought in about 15 percent more money than the asking price.\n\n\u201cI think that people who haven\u2019t grown up in a small, tight-knit community like this are very surprised by honesty,\u201d Brekke said.\n\nFor David Brekke, who works from home as a business consultant, the idea seemed logical. He grew up in a small town in Minnesota where one of his neighbors used to leave corn on the cob in the yard with a cardboard box as cash register.\n\n\u201cNobody ever took the box with the money in it,\u201d Brekke said.\n\nThe Vault\u2019s customers can pay by credit card, cash or check. There\u2019s a note below the cash slot that says \u201cNo. I.O.U.s.\u201d Another placard notes that exact change is not necessary \u2026 \u201cround down and give yourself a break or round up and help us stay in business.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Coffee shop on honor system works in North Dakota", "author": "Dave Kolpack", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Coffee shop on honor system works in North Dakota", "title": "Coffee shop on honor system works in North Dakota", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/08/24/coffee_shop_on_honor_system_works_in_north_dakota/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/odd-self-service-coffee-shop.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Coffee shop on honor system works in North Dakota", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/odd-self-service-coffee-shop.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "title": "Coffee shop on honor system works in North Dakota", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Coffee shop on honor system works in North Dakota", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca4a3\"", "article_summary": "Brekke and his wife, Kimberly, run The Vault coffee shop in Valley City, a town of about 6,700 people that\u2019s about 45 minutes from Fargo.\nCoffee lovers can choose java from a commercial brewer, complete with gourmet creams and flavorings, or individual servings from a Keurig brewing system, or K-Cups.\nThe food and drink is located on a refurbished teller counter at the front of the shop.\nFor David Brekke, who works from home as a business consultant, the idea seemed logical.\nHe grew up in a small town in Minnesota where one of his neighbors used to leave corn on the cob in the yard with a cardboard box as cash register."}
