Four people abstained.\n\nThe recommendations go to DFL Gov. Mark Dayton and the Legislature in a report later this month, but Friday\u2019s vote showed a clear partisan divide.\n\nAll three DFL lawmakers on the panel supported the plan, while the two Republican legislators who voted were against it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to be carrying these to the Legislature, and hope that we can get a good start on implementing some of these,\u201d said Sen. Tony Lourey, DFL-Kerrick, a task force member.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think the fiscal model is pretty clear that it\u2019s a good deal\u201d to expand MinnesotaCare, said Lourey, whose party controls the state Senate. \u201cI think it might have legs.\u201d\n\nRep. Matt Dean, R-Dellwood, also a task force member, said the biggest proposals wouldn\u2019t fly in the Republican-controlled House.\n\n\u201cThe committee voted to add more cost to just about everywhere \u2026,\u201d Dean said. \u201cI wish we had made some tougher choices and actually tackled how are we going to pay for MinnesotaCare, without simply saying: \u2018Well, we\u2019re going to raise taxes.\u2019 \u201d\n\nDayton called for creation of the 29-person task force last year as lawmakers debated changes to MNsure and MinnesotaCare, in particular.\n\nOn MNsure, the panel didn\u2019t embrace a proposal from House Republicans to dump the state\u2019s online marketplace and move to the federal HealthCare.gov exchange. MNsure has had technology problems and lower-than-expected enrollment since it was launched in 2013 as part of the federal Affordable Care Act.\n\nMinnesotaCare action\n\nOn MinnesotaCare, the task force backed a proposed expansion of the program to cover another 41,200 people. House Republicans have called for directing enrollees to private coverage.\n\nMinnesotaCare provides subsidized health coverage to a group that\u2019s often described as the \u201cworking poor\u201d \u2014 people who don\u2019t qualify for the state-federal Medicaid program and don\u2019t get coverage from an employer, either. MinnesotaCare currently covers about 120,000 people.\n\nThe program is funded in part by a tax that health care providers collect, which is currently scheduled to sunset in 2019.\n\nThe task force called for continuing the provider tax, which would generate $972 million for state health care programs over a two-year period ending June 2021.\n\nLourey said a study developed for the task force showed that MinnesotaCare coverage could be expanded without adding costs to the state budget, and might actually generate savings. He argued that the proposed expansion is actually a restoration of the program, because those who would be added to MinnesotaCare were previously eligible for the program.\n\n\u201cThe feds have some new, really interesting options [in 2017] that allow us to restore MinnesotaCare,\u201d Lourey said during Friday\u2019s meeting near the Capitol in St. Paul.\n\nOpposition to expansion\n\nBut task force member Molly Jungbauer, chief executive of Hollstadt & Associates, said expanding public health insurance coverage would shift costs onto the private health insurance market, because programs like MinnesotaCare pay doctors and hospitals significantly less for providing health care services.\n\nThe study done for the task force suggested that doctors and hospitals might get paid about 50 percent more for providing the same services to people with private individual health insurance policies, than for those in public programs.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know where else that expense can go, because our providers have fixed costs that have to be reimbursed somehow,\u201d said Jungbauer, who voted against the task force\u2019s recommendations.\n\nTask force member Lynn Blewett said any savings generated through the MinnesotaCare expansion could be put toward improving reimbursement rates to doctors and hospitals through the program.\n\nExpanding MinnesotaCare would have implications for MNsure, because many people who might newly qualify for the program can currently purchase through the health insurance exchange.\n\nThe proposed recommendations do not support a move to HealthCare.gov because the switch would be costly and force the state to surrender control, said Blewett, who is a health policy researcher at the University of Minnesota and voted in support of the recommendations.\n\nThe task force also called for a review of MNsure\u2019s performance after the current open enrollment period.\n\nTwitter: @chrissnowbeck", "article_metadata": {"description": "A state task force on health care finance adopted a long list of recommendations Friday, including expansion of the MinnesotaCare health insurance program, maintaining a tax collected by health care providers, and a review of the state&rsquo;s MNsure exchange.", "og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "A state task force on health care finance adopted a long list of recommendations Friday, including expansion of the MinnesotaCare health insurance program, maintaining a tax collected by health care providers, and a review of the state&rsquo;s MNsure exchange.", "title": "Task force calls for health care changes, balks at HealthCare.gov switch", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/task-force-calls-for-health-care-changes-balks-at-healthcare-gov-switch/365477071/", "image": {"url": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201091", "width": 1680, "identifier": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201091", "height": 876}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A state task force on health care finance adopted a long list of recommendations Friday, including expansion of the MinnesotaCare health insurance program, maintaining a tax collected by health care providers, and a review of the state&rsquo;s MNsure exchange.", "title": "Task force calls for health care changes, balks at HealthCare.gov switch", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/task-force-calls-for-health-care-changes-balks-at-healthcare-gov-switch/365477071/", "image": {"src": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201091", "identifier": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201091"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "article": {"tag": "MNsure"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "news_keywords": "health care,health care task force,MinnesotaCare,MNsure"}, "article_summary": "A state task force on health care finance adopted a long list of recommendations Friday, including expansion of the MinnesotaCare health insurance program, maintaining a tax collected by health care providers, and a review of the state\u2019s MNsure exchange.\nThe task force called for continuing the provider tax, which would generate $972 million for state health care programs over a two-year period ending June 2021.\nThe task force also called for a review of MNsure\u2019s performance after the current open enrollment period.\n\u201cI think it might have legs.\u201dRep.
