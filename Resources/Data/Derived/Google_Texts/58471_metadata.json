Imagine the situation was reversed and the NSA had been caught lifting the personnel files of virtually every human being who works for the Chinese government. How tense would relations be with China right now? I\u2019m thinking somewhere on the order of you-just-bombed-our-embassy tense. As it is, if there are plans afoot to retaliate, the White House is doing an uncharacteristically good job of keeping them secret so far.\n\nTrue confession: I\u2019ve grown so used to seeing U.S. officials go unpunished for gigantic mistakes that not until I read this piece by Michael Dougherty did it occur to me that no one at OPM\u2019s been disciplined yet. It\u2019s hard not to be complacent about unaccountability when there\u2019s so much of it.\n\nWe presume that the NSA that keeps up to date on everyone\u2019s smart phone metadata has better security than the OPM. But the contractors who build the digital systems for the federal government, from the OPM to ObamaCare, exist only because their business model is to serve the federal government. The primary business plan of these companies is to jump through insane bureaucratic hoops (like becoming Y2K compliant), then certifying that they have done so to get contracts. That means they are primarily creatures that exist to navigate and satisfy regulatory hurdles, not to deliver \u201camazing products\u201d that \u201cjust work.\u201d For that you have to go to Silicon Valley proper, and even they outsource much of the hard work to China. In a sense, the data breach reveals how far American government is from republicanism in character. Republics are flinty things. Men who govern republics are supposed to find it shameful when they waste the public\u2019s money. They are supposed to think of their failures as a kind of betrayal of the public trust. But how many people are going to get fired for this? How many will lose contracts or suffer public and professional humiliation? None is my guess.\n\nJim Geraghty calls the post-hack complacency a perfect symbol of the Obama era, although I\u2019d broaden that to say it\u2019s a perfect symbol of modern politics, period:\n\nThe story of the Obama era is the story of one colossal federal government train-wreck after another. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms shipped guns to Mexican drug cartels in Fast & Furious. Recovery.gov, allegedly designed to promote openness and accountability, ended up filled with bad data\u2026 The president stood in front of the White House, urging the American public to use Healthcare.gov when it wasn\u2019t working\u2026 The Obama administration toppled the government of Libya \u2013 without any supporting act of Congress \u2014 then sent Americans there and ignored the security requests from our ambassador\u2026 Veterans died, waiting for care, while the branch offices of the VA assure Washington everything is fine.\n\nThat\u2019s not even half his list. Why is it, Geraghty concludes, that with a record of failure \u2014 unpunished failure, to be clear \u2014 as long as this, progressives still want the feds to have an ever greater role in American life? Let me supplement that with another question: Why is it that Obama and his inner circle seem to value loyalty, in declining to punish their hires for gross incompetence, more than they do accountability? Why shouldn\u2019t O call a presser and stand there for 45 minutes shaking his fist that underlings ever could have allowed this to happen? John Schindler says the OPM hack amounts to nothing less than the wrecking of American espionage, a disaster arguably even bigger than Edward Snowden stealing the keys to the castle from the NSA. A rival power now has everything they need to sniff out, blackmail, frame, or spear-phish practically anyone who\u2019s worked for Uncle Sam over the last 30 years. \u201cThis isn\u2019t shame on China,\u201d said former CIA chief Michael Hayden. \u201cThis is shame on us.\u201d Right, but that\u2019s usually the case; most major government debacles were preventable. Then someone fails to prevent them and \u2026 nothing happens. Why is that?\n\nPart of the answer, I think, is that the age of ubiquitous media requires the White House and its deputies to be careful about alienating employees. Who knows what other scandals are known to higher-ups at OPM, or what sort of security breaches they could orchestrate if they got fired and felt disgruntled? Make enemies of them and there\u2019s no shortage of reporters in print media, TV media, or online who\u2019ll be happy to listen to them spill whatever they have. Unaccountability, in other words, is the price of damage control. And it\u2019s also the price of competitive government hiring: If you can\u2019t afford to pay a qualified applicant as much as a private-sector firm could, one way to make up for the shortfall in compensation is with job security. You can target tea-party nonprofits for special tax scrutiny, leave veterans to languish on eternal waiting lists at the VA, or get caught sleeping while China\u2019s rifling through the federal filing cabinets, but only very rarely, when perceptions of inaction become too politically painful, will the White House move to punish employees for it. We\u2019re all used to that. What Dougherty\u2019s asking is why perceptions of inaction at OPM aren\u2019t already so painful that Obama has no choice but to pull the trapdoor on someone. Ultimately it\u2019s a critique of the public even more so than our government. Why aren\u2019t more people demanding that heads roll at OPM?\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Accountability.", "title": "Will anyone at OPM be fired for not preventing this catastrophic mega-hack by China?", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2015/06/16/will-anyone-at-opm-be-fired-for-not-preventing-this-catastrophic-mega-hack-by-china/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@allahpundit"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-16T19:21:22+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-16T17:53:36+00:00"}, "keywords": "China, chinese, hack, intelligence, military, Obama, opm, personnel,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "article_summary": "Will anyone at OPM be fired for not preventing this catastrophic mega-hack by China?\nAs it is, if there are plans afoot to retaliate, the White House is doing an uncharacteristically good job of keeping them secret so far.\nWe presume that the NSA that keeps up to date on everyone\u2019s smart phone metadata has better security than the OPM.\nPart of the answer, I think, is that the age of ubiquitous media requires the White House and its deputies to be careful about alienating employees.\nWho knows what other scandals are known to higher-ups at OPM, or what sort of security breaches they could orchestrate if they got fired and felt disgruntled?"}
