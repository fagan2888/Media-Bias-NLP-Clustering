Joustra said there were sufficient indications commercial flights were at risk after several military planes had been shot down prior to the Malaysia Airlines flight being struck.\n\nThe crash investigators weren\u2019t assigning blame for who fired the missile. Further forensic analysis would be required to determine the exact launch location within a 320-square-kilometer (124-square-mile) area, Joustra, said, adding that such efforts lay outside the scope of the crash probe.\n\nAn expanded version of this report appears at WSJ.com.\n\nMore from MarketWatch", "article_metadata": {"lifp_basePath": "https://id.marketwatch.com/access", "twitter": {"domain": "marketwatch.com", "image": {"width": 569, "identifier": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-CO171_justic_MG_20140723100325.jpg", "height": 398}, "description": "Accident investigators also conclude that Ukraine should have closed airspace due to fighting in the east.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": {"id": 624413}}, "parsely-author": "Robert Wall", "article.content_group": "marketwatch", "article.section": "General", "parsely-type": "post", "description": "Accident investigators also conclude that Ukraine should have closed airspace due to fighting in the east.", "parsely-link": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/investigators-say-mh17-downed-by-russian-made-missile-2015-10-13", "author": "Maarten van Tartwijk, Ellen Proper , Robert Wall", "parsely-title": "Investigators say MH17 downed by Russian-made missile", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=336693422", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-10-13T08:11:00-04:00", "page.site": "marketwatch", "robots": "noarchive,noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 283204329838}, "parsely-section": "MW_General", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "og": {"site_name": "MarketWatch", "description": "Accident investigators also conclude that Ukraine should have closed airspace due to fighting in the east.", "title": "Investigators say MH17 downed by Russian-made missile", "url": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/investigators-say-mh17-downed-by-russian-made-missile-2015-10-13", "image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-CO171_justic_MG_20140723100325.jpg", "type": "article"}, "ob": {"image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-CO171_justic_MG_20140723100325.jpg"}, "article.id": "E3624984-71A2-11E5-B1C0-820DFA35E02D", "position": 1}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0b56\"", "article_summary": "The crash investigators weren\u2019t assigning blame for who fired the missile.\nReutersGILZE-RIJEN AIR BASE, the Netherlands--Investigators probing the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 have concluded that a sophisticated, Russian-made antiaircraft missile struck the Boeing Co. 777 jetliner, causing it to break apart in midair.\nJoustra said there were sufficient indications commercial flights were at risk after several military planes had been shot down prior to the Malaysia Airlines flight being struck.\nAccident investigators also concluded that the Ukrainian government should have closed the airspace over the embattled east where the country\u2019s armed forces were battling separatists.\nIt is the first time those involved in the probe have publicly endorsed the long-held view such a missile was used to shoot down the passenger plane."}
