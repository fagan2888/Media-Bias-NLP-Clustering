The line that formed at midnight outside the Webster Bank Arena in Bridgeport, Conn., wasn't for concert tickets or a sporting event. It was for the free two-day dental clinic last year known as the Connecticut Mission of Mercy, and participants lined up six hours before the doors opened.

It's clear from examples like this that the need for oral health care is still great. That's because there are many barriers to dental care for uninsured and underinsured populations. For example, the dental sections in Medicaid and the State Children's Health Insurance Programs (SCHIP) in New Jersey, or the Husky program in Connecticut, rarely have enough money budgeted to cover dental needs. Patients covered under public programs face additional hurdles, such as lack of dentists who accept Medicaid, transportation to get to the dentist, or the cost of missing work to do so. Many states don't even provide adult dental coverage, and it's not required under the Affordable Care Act.

That's why the Delta Dental of New Jersey Foundation has pledged over $800,000 in grants awarded to 33 community programs in New Jersey and Connecticut for 2014. A goal of the grants is to reduce the number of complex and urgent dental cases resulting from the lack of preventive care, catching problems earlier to reduce complications later. The funds are designed to help the uninsured and under insured, specifically children whose families are at or below the federal poverty level, the developmentally disabled, and vulnerable seniors.

I'm pleased to share with you the 2014 grant recipients, listed by category below. For recipients by county, and more on the history of the Foundation's grants, see our press release .
