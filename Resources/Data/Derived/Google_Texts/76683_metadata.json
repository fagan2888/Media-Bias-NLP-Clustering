Officials hope it will appeal to young people -- a coveted customer pool -- and to people who have smart phones but don\u2019t have regular access to a computer.\n\nThe app allows people to shop anonymously, create accounts and view health plan options. People will also be able to upload documents through the app by taking pictures of the documents with their device\u2019s camera.\n\nThe full application process can't be completed on the app. Feedback from customers indicated that people most wanted the ability to shop anonymously and upload verification documents, Access Health\u2019s Chief Information Officer James Wadleigh said.\n\nThe app is currently available from Apple\u2019s iTunes store and is expected to be available Friday from the Android marketplace. An iPad version is scheduled to roll out June 16, and a version for Android tablets is expected to be available June 23.\n\nWadleigh said a Spanish-language version is in the early phase of development.\n\nWithout publicity, the app had been downloaded 120 times as of Thursday, and more than 400 documents had been uploaded using it, Wadleigh said.\n\nDuring the open enrollment period for this year\u2019s coverage, more than 20 percent of customers signed up on smartphones or tablets, using the regular Access Health website. About 25 percent of enrollments that came in after 7 p.m. were through smart phones or tablets, CEO Kevin Counihan said.\n\nThe app will be available free to users, but exchange officials are considering selling the software to other states as a way to generate revenue. Access Health has also offered its exchange system software to other states, but doesn't charge them because the code was developed using federal funds. The exchange used non-federal funds for the app, which was developed by Amtech Systems, a New York company.", "article_metadata": {"standout": "http://ctmirror.org/2014/06/05/access-health-cts-mobile-app-rolling-out/", "news_keywords": "Health Care, Access Health CT, Affordable Care Act, iTunes store, Obamacare", "original-source": "http://ctmirror.org/2014/06/05/access-health-cts-mobile-app-rolling-out/", "og": {"site_name": "The CT Mirror", "description": "Access Health officials say the free mobile app will make it easier for people to shop for health care coverage using smart phones or tablets.
