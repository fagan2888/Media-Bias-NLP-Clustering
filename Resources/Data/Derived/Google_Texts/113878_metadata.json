Regardless of who plays quarterback, I don\u2019t see the Broncos winning more than three games the rest of the season. I may eat my words, but I don\u2019t think so.\n\nGary, Thornton\n\nKiz: In the span of two weeks, the perfect world that was Broncos Country has been filled with dark clouds and doubt. The No. 1 seed in the AFC playoffs now seems like a silly dream, but should coach Gary Kubiak really be checking his rearview mirror for the Chiefs or Raiders gaining on him in the division race? Listen, new quarterback Brock Osweiler will make goofs as he learns on the job. A two-game losing streak could become four. The real test for Kubiak will be not to panic in defeat and return Peyton Manning to the starting lineup before he is healthy.\n\nPain pills! Stat! Manning has failed the Broncos. Don\u2019t blame John Elway or anyone else. Just be real and honest: Manning is done! He will be remembered as the best \u201cstat QB\u201d ever, and I know for sure Tom Brady would agree.\n\nG.A., Indianapolis\n\nKiz: Ouch. That\u2019s a 15-yard penalty. Unnecessary roughness. Are you trying out to be a member of the Broncos\u2019 defensive backfield?\n\nPut him in, coach. After all those years in Houston trying to stop Manning, Kubiak has finally found a way: Coach him.\n\nBob, repping the 702\n\nKiz: Snark attack! That\u2019s mean \u2026 but funny.\n\nSelfie. During the loss to Kansas City, Manning proved himself to be a selfish, self-absorbed man, by keeping himself in the game at the expense of the Broncos reaching a victory.\n\nSusan, Centennial\n\nKiz: Going into the game against the Chiefs, Manning needed to complete one stinking pass to break the NFL record for career yards passing. Had he reached the mark the previous game in Indianapolis, would Kubiak have been more likely to tell his ailing quarterback to take the day off against Kansas City? Everybody in Denver, from the coach to paying customers, wanted Manning to break the record. That\u2019s not selfish. It\u2019s human.\n\nKiszla\u2019s the biggest pain. And today\u2019s parting shot is a warning the Broncos have a far bigger problem than Manning\u2019s aching foot or the team\u2019s two-game losing streak.\n\nKiz, I have met the enemy of Broncos Country, and he is you.\n\nStephen, bleeds orange\n\nMark Kiszla: mkiszla@denverpost.com or twitter.com/markkiszla", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Kiszla: Regardless of quarterback, Broncos may not win many more games", "title": "Kiszla: Regardless of quarterback, Broncos may not win many more games", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/11/21/kiszla-regardless-of-quarterback-broncos-may-not-win-many-more-games/", "image": {"width": 512, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg", "height": 512}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-21T17:42:36+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-23T02:20:53+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Mark Kiszla"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2f10\"", "article_summary": "Regardless of who plays quarterback, I don\u2019t see the Broncos winning more than three games the rest of the season.\nAfter all those years in Houston trying to stop Manning, Kubiak has finally found a way: Coach him.\nGary, ThorntonKiz: In the span of two weeks, the perfect world that was Broncos Country has been filled with dark clouds and doubt.\nAnd today\u2019s parting shot is a warning the Broncos have a far bigger problem than Manning\u2019s aching foot or the team\u2019s two-game losing streak.\nListen, new quarterback Brock Osweiler will make goofs as he learns on the job."}
