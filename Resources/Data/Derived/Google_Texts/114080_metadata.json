Oct 6 by via California Nurses Association\n\nMonday Oct 5th, 2015 5:07 PM Nurses who work at Contra Costa Regional Medical Center and clinics across the County will officially begin a two-day strike Tuesday, October 6, after what nurses say is the County\u2019s continued failure to address serious patient care concerns they have been bringing to the County\u2019s attention for over a year.\n\ncounty_rns_california_nur...\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe would, of course, rather be at the bedside, providing care,\u201d said Liz Isenberg, RN. \u201cBut the loss of experienced nurses has resulted in deteriorating conditions for our patients at the County hospital and clinics.

CNA notes there is a 30 percent wage gap for County RNs compared to the nearby private hospitals, and over 100 nurses have left the County in the last year. County nurses care for some of the sickest and most vulnerable members of the community, who seek care at Contra Costa County\u2019s safety net hospital and outpatient clinics.\u201cWe would, of course, rather be at the bedside, providing care,\u201d said Liz Isenberg, RN. \u201cBut the loss of experienced nurses has resulted in deteriorating conditions for our patients at the County hospital and clinics.
