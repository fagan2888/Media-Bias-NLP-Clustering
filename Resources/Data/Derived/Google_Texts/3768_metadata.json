(Sarah Rose / Daily Record)\n\nEven though it's only been a month since Penrose Elementary School Principal Michelle Lesser took the job, she already feels at home.\n\nLesser said since she's been there, she has received an unexpected free cup of chai tea from Coyote Caf\u00e9 that was brought to her at the school, a volunteer offered to take recess duty, the chamber of commerce invited her to their breakfast and about half of the students' parents took time out of their day to meet her during a meet and greet.\n\n\"The whole Penrose community has been thoughtful and welcoming,\" Lesser said. \"I just feel so privileged to be here. It's an honor.\"\n\nShe said her goal for this year is getting to know as many people in the town as possible.\n\n\"It's all about building relationships with people ... the community, students and staff, parents. And then from there, we'll set goals together,\" Lesser said.\n\nShe said one of the main reasons she moved to the area from Mesa County is because she has a great relationship with her relatives.\n\n\"I wanted to be closer to my family. I grew up in Salida. My dad's still in Salida,\" Lesser said. \"My mom lives in Colorado Springs. My brother's in Ca\u00f1on City and my husband's family is in Pueblo.\"\n\nShe started a teaching position at Fremont Elementary at the beginning of the year, but when she saw the job opening for PES, she couldn't pass it up.\n\n\"I love teaching, but I wanted to make a difference on a larger scale,\" Lesser said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLesser has experience as a principal at Clifton Elementary School. She was employed there from 2008 to 2013.\n\n\"We were actually a title 1 school,\" she said. \"What happened is the federal government gave money to states to turn around their lowest performing schools and I was in the first round of that. It just happened that Clifton was in the bottom 5 percent of schools in the state of Colorado.\"\n\nTo receive the $2.6 million grant, the school presented a plan of action to help boost students' test scores to the Colorado Education Commissioner.\n\n\"We were low, but from our first year of implementation, we went from turnaround to performance in one year. It was really a superb turnaround,\" she said.\n\nPrior to working at Clifton Elementary School, she was a first-grade teacher for 10 years at Fruitvale Elementary School in Grand Junction.\n\nSarah Rose: 719-285-5157, roses@canoncitydailyrecord.com or twitter.com/sarahfaithrose", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.canoncitydailyrecord.com/ci_26990346/feeling-welcome-michelle-lesser-happy-be-new-penrose", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site49/2014/1121/20141121__22DRPrincipal~1_300.jpg", "sailthru.author": "By Sarah Rose \n \n  The Daily Record", "description": "Even though it's only been a month since Penrose Elementary School Principal Michelle Lesser took the job, she already feels at home.", "ag": {"canon": "CanonCityDailyRecord:article:26990346:view"}, "startDate": "2014-11-22T07:53:10-0700", "og": {"url": "http://www.canoncitydailyrecord.com/ci_26990346/feeling-welcome-michelle-lesser-happy-be-new-penrose", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site49/2014/1121/20141121__22DRPrincipal~1.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Even though it's only been a month since Penrose Elementary School Principal Michelle Lesser took the job, she already feels at home.", "title": "Feeling welcome: Michelle Lesser happy to be new Penrose principal, near family"}, "twitter": {"domain": "canoncitydailyrecord.com", "description": "Even though it's only been a month since Penrose Elementary School Principal Michelle Lesser took the job, she already feels at home.", "title": "Feeling welcome: Michelle Lesser happy to be new Penrose principal, near family", "url": "http://www.canoncitydailyrecord.com/ci_26990346/feeling-welcome-michelle-lesser-happy-be-new-penrose", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site49/2014/1121/20141121__22DRPrincipal~1.jpg", "site": "@CCDR_news", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-11-22T07:53:10-0700", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "sailthru.title": "Feeling welcome: Michelle Lesser happy to be new Penrose principal, near family", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site49/2014/1121/20141121__22DRPrincipal~1.jpg", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Canon City Breaking News, Sports, Weather, Traffic", "google-site-verification": "oCjqPZ-ii-IZW-fBJ0mmX5dmH5aafePG3FLx_kSYFiA", "modificationDate": "2014-11-22T07:54:38-0700", "endDate": "2024-11-21T21:13:13-0700", "byline": "By Sarah RoseThe", "sailthru.site": "canoncitydailyrecord.com", "pubDate": "2014-11-22T07:56:14-0700", "news_keywords": "Canon City news, Colorado news, world news, national news, local news, business news, sports news, entertainment news, us news, Canon City Daily Record"}, "article_summary": "Prior to working at Clifton Elementary School, she was a first-grade teacher for 10 years at Fruitvale Elementary School in Grand Junction.\nNew Penrose Elementary School Principal Michelle Lesser sits on a couch inside the school's office on Friday.\n(Sarah Rose / Daily Record)Even though it's only been a month since Penrose Elementary School Principal Michelle Lesser took the job, she already feels at home.\nAdvertisementLesser has experience as a principal at Clifton Elementary School.\n\"The whole Penrose community has been thoughtful and welcoming,\" Lesser said."}
