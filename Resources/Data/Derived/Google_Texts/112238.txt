WASHINGTON (CBSDFW.COM) – U.S. Senator John Cornyn introduced a legislation Friday that provides funding and resources to combat the Zika virus in Texas and across the country.

The legislation allocates $1.1 billion in federal funding to the Department of Health and Human Services and Department of State.

“This legislation will give health professionals the resources they need to help protect Texans against the spread of the Zika virus without adding to the debt,” said Sen. Cornyn. “We must give those on the ground the tools they need to proactively address this threat, and I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will support the commonsense, fiscally-responsible approach towards averting a potential health crisis.”

In order to provide funding, $1.2 billion is being cut from the Affordable Care Act’s FY 2017 and FY 2018 Prevention and Public Health Fund.

The legislation also includes a provision that would waive the Clean Water Act permit requirement. Because of this, state and local authorities will also be able to more efficiently spray to protect against mosquitos year-round.

A local Frisco woman recently tested positive for Zika virus.
