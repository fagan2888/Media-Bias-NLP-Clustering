Boulder County and the city of Boulder will conduct audible tests of their emergency warning siren system at 10 a.m. and again at 7 p.m. Monday.

The county sirens are used to alert residents about potential dangers from floods, tornadoes and other immediate threats. There are 25 outdoor warning sirens in place throughout the county, including locations in Boulder, Erie, Jamestown, Lafayette, Louisville, Lyons, Marshall, Eldorado Springs, Superior and the University of Colorado at Boulder.

Longmont also will be making the first 2014 test of its own outdoor warning system at 10 a.m. Monday. Longmontâ€™s system includes both sirens and loudspeakers that the city uses to alert residents of potential emergencies such as tornadoes.

However, Longmont will not use its sirens for flood alerts, city officials have said.
