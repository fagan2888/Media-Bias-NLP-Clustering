PeaceHealth and Providence have signed a letter of intent to develop a new health and wellness center in Vancouver, Washington.

The companies said it’s the first of multiple initiatives.

Dave Underriner, CEO of Providence in Oregon, said his organization and health care services around the nation are reacting to the Affordable Care Act.

“I think you’re going to see all sorts of partnerships and affiliations and collaborations, different ways for organizations to come together to work in concert, in terms of serving communities,” he said.



Underriner said the PeaceHealth Providence collaborative will likely result in more jobs — both from building the new center and staffing it.

The recently announced merger between Legacy and PacificSource is also expected to create jobs.
