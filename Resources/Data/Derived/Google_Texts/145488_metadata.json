Pat Roberts, a Kansas Republican. School meal programs are overseen by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and reauthorization legislation for those programs undoubtedly will pass through the committee.\n\nAgriculture Committee press secretary Meghan Cline said Friday that Roberts currently is working with Sen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., to write the legislation.\n\n\u201cChairman Roberts is working with Ranking Member Stabenow to craft a reauthorization package that is bipartisan, increases efficiency and effectiveness, has flexibility in school meal standards, and addresses program integrity, high error rates, and improper payments within the programs,\u201d Cline said in an email.\n\nIn 2010, Congress passed and President Barack Obama signed the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act, funding school meal programs for five years. The most hotly debated portion of the legislation, then and now, was its changes to nutrition standards for schools, changes enacted as part of first lady Michelle Obama\u2019s efforts to mitigate child obesity.\n\nThe nutrition changes set off years of snarky criticisms. In 2012, a small Kansas school district in Wallace County garnered national attention when students and teachers recorded a video called \u201cWe Are Hungry,\u201d a parody of the popular song \u201cWe Are Young.\u201d Last year, students began posting unappealing photos of their lunches to Twitter with the hashtag #ThanksMichelleObama.\n\nIn an interview Friday, USDA deputy undersecretary Kathryn Wilson said she hopes the 2010 changes remain in place.\n\n\u201cWe stand by the nutrition standards,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cI really strongly believe that it\u2019s our obligation to teach children how to eat better.\u201d\n\nWilson argues children come to schools to learn and thus teaching them how to eat healthier is a natural extension of the schools\u2019 role.\n\nU.S. Reps. Lynn Jenkins and Mike Pompeo, Republicans who represent the state\u2019s 2nd District and 4th District respectively, disagree.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the federal government should be involved in that whatsoever,\u201d Jenkins said last week, referring to school meal nutrition standards. \u201cI think there is a lot of intelligent people here locally that know what kids need to eat to thrive and decisions are better made closer to the people than by some bureaucrat in Washington.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act is yet another example of a failed one-size-fits-all federal education policy,\u201d Pompeo said in an email Friday. \u201cFrom what our kids read to what our kids eat \u2014 these are all decisions that should be made by parents, teachers, and administrators.\u201d\n\nRoberts, meanwhile, seems to have a more moderate opinion, placing himself between the USDA and his Kansas colleagues. The state\u2019s senior senator said school districts have made gains but deserve flexibility when crafting menus.\n\n\u201cI have traveled all over Kansas, eating school lunches with students and meeting with nutrition directors,\u201d Roberts said in an email. \u201cI keep hearing one word over and over again \u2014 flexibility, which means that we need (to) protect the tremendous gains already achieved by many school districts and provide assistance to others so they too may achieve success.\u201d\n\nWilson said children need time to adapt to change. In Kansas, she said, great strides have been made in recent years.\n\n\u201cNutrition as a whole has come on people\u2019s radar screens,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cParents are more involved.\u201d\n\nWhile she hasn\u2019t spoken to him directly, Wilson said Roberts \u201cbelieves in good nutrition.\u201d\n\nDespite Wilson\u2019s proclamation there is bipartisan support for the school meal programs, political divides exist over how best to implement them. The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act passed in 2010 with the support of only 17 House Republicans. Jenkins joined fellow Kansas Republicans Jerry Moran, then a member of the House, and Rep. Todd Tiahrt in voting against the bill. Rep. Dennis Moore, a Democrat representing Kansas\u2019 3rd District, voted in favor.\n\nOn Monday, Jenkins stopped by an Overbrook elementary school participating in a less controversial component of the school meals program, one that provides meals for all children under the age of 18 during the summer months.\n\n\u201cThe federal government does a whole lot for us that we don\u2019t need them to do or want them to do, quite honestly, but feeding hungry kids and being a safety net, helping folks get back on their feet, is always a worthy cause and, I think, one that conservatives support,\u201d Jenkins said.\n\nShare Our Strength, a group aimed at ending child hunger, is advocating on behalf of the summer meals program as its reauthorization looms in Congress. Lucy Melcher, the group\u2019s associate director of advocacy, said the program has \u201coverwhelming bipartisan support.\u201d\n\n\u201cInterest has been so strong from Republicans and Democrats in the House and the Senate,\u201d Melcher said. \u201cWith the summer meals program, we haven\u2019t seen a lot of significant challenges.\u201d\n\nMelcher views the next few months as an opportunity to expand the summer meals program by allowing its organizers to give children enough food to last several days and grant families an extended grocery tax credit during the summer months.\n\nMelcher, like Wilson, sees Roberts as an ally.\n\n\u201cI think he understands, coming from a rural state like Kansas, that we have a huge opportunity ahead of us,\u201d she said.\n\nBut fiscal conservatives, like Jenkins and Pompeo, will be keeping an eye on the reauthorization package\u2019s price tag.\n\n\u201cAs Congress looks to reform and strengthen the safety net, I will remain focused on increasing efficiencies and making sure we are efficiently targeting limited taxpayer dollars to those most in need,\u201d she said in an email.\n\nThe Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act expires Sept. 30, leaving Roberts and the rest of Congress 87 days to replace it.\n\n\u201cThe anticipation is we would get reauthorization,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cBut you never know.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "News, Education, Local, State, Justin Wingerter", "og": {"site_name": "CJOnline.com", "description": "For the first time since 2010, federal lawmakers are tasked with reauthorizing the Child Nutrition Act of 1966, granting the Republican-controlled Congress an opportunity to overhaul programs and policies that have garnered significant debate in recent years.", "title": "Sen.
