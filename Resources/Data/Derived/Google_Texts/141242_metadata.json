Council rules allow that rarely used option.\n\nThe Safety & Well-being Committee voted against her proposal 4-3.\n\nCommittee members cited differing reasons for voting it down, from a lack of support from some developers and business interests \u2014 including the Downtown Denver Partnership \u2014 to doubt about the law\u2019s purpose. A couple of developers testified in favor.\n\nTaking it to the full council would allow up to six more members to weigh in.\n\n\u201cI think it is important that this council hear from the full breadth of the community on this topic before each member votes,\u201d Kniech said after Tuesday\u2019s meeting.\n\nShe hopes to introduce the Inclusionary Housing Ordinance rewrite as planned Aug. 18, with a one-hour courtesy public hearing. Whether to allow the public to testify will be up to President Chris Herndon, who voted against the measure in the committee.\n\nKniech has held public forums and twice briefed the committee. Its membership changed last month, resulting in some members who may have been less familiar with her plans.\n\nThe ordinance, controversial since it was adopted in 2002, requires developers of condo projects to provide some affordable, for-sale units. It doesn\u2019t apply to rental developments.\n\nThe old rules require new projects with 30 or more units to mark down 10 percent of them to affordable prices for qualified buyers. But only 20 affordable units have been produced under the requirement in the past five years, prompting calls for a rewrite.\n\nDevelopers often have opted out of the set-aside rules by paying fees that amount to half the adjusted unit price. That money has helped subsidize affordable projects elsewhere.\n\nKniech proposes changes that include making the flat $5,500 city incentive per affordable unit a dynamic amount. It would range from $2,500 to $25,000, depending on where in the city the project is located and how difficult it is to find affordable housing nearby.\n\nIn more expensive neighborhoods, she wants to increase sharply the opt-out fees from 50 percent of the marked-down unit price to 70 percent. It would be much less in other areas.\n\nKniech also wants to give developers a chance to offer alternative plans that still would comply with the goal of providing affordable housing, even if off-site.\n\nBesides Herndon, the committee\u2019s other no votes came from Jeanne Faatz, Peggy Lehmann and Mary Beth Susman. Joining Kniech in support were Chairman Paul Lopez and Albus Brooks.\n\nJon Murray: 303-954-1405, jmurray@denverpost.com or twitter.com/JonMurray", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Denver City Council panel votes down tougher affordable housing law", "title": "Denver City Council panel votes down tougher affordable housing law", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/08/05/denver-city-council-panel-votes-down-tougher-affordable-housing-law/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140805_111324_Robin-Kniech.jpg", "height": 439}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140805_111324_Robin-Kniech.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-05T18:50:09+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T10:53:45+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Kniech proposes changes that include making the flat $5,500 city incentive per affordable unit a dynamic amount.\nBut only 20 affordable units have been produced under the requirement in the past five years, prompting calls for a rewrite.\nAn attempt to fix Denver\u2019s affordable-housing ordinance faces an uncertain future after a City Council committee rejected it Tuesday.\nCouncil rules allow that rarely used option.\nThat money has helped subsidize affordable projects elsewhere."}
