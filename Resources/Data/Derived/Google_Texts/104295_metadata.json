This year the group has eyes on Sunday, which is Valentine\u2019s Day.\n\nIt\u2019s a problem of narrative, Caitlin La Ruffa, executive director of the Love and Fidelity Network, told The Daily Signal.\n\n\u201cThere are only two narratives,\u201d La Ruffa said. \u201cOne narrative is the hookup culture, which is anonymous; there\u2019s no communication and no caring. Students get hurt, and it\u2019s just not healthy.\u201d\n\nThe other option is being \u201coverly attached\u201d and \u201ccodependent\u201d before even getting to know each other, she explained.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re here to propose a new script, a script that says an invitation to coffee isn\u2019t a marriage proposal, just a way to get to know someone.\u201d\n\nDuring its first year, the campaign focused on providing practical dating advice, like how to ask someone on a date, where to go, and how to be courteous without being creepy.\n\n\u201cThis year we decided to tackle fewer how-tos and more encouragement to get over dating hang-ups\u201d La Ruffa said.\n\nThis year\u2019s encouragement came in the form of bright red posters featuring the campaign hashtag, #bringdatingback, and cartoons demonstrating how dating \u201cisn\u2019t that complicated\u201d or \u201cthat old-fashioned.\u201d\n\n\u201cI loved the idea of promoting healthy dating on campus through posters,\u201d Laura Wittmann, a senior at Ave Maria University, told The Daily Signal in an email. \u201cThe posters spark conversations that might not be happening anyways, and I hope that they inspire students to ask each other out.\u201d\n\nThe current president of Princeton University\u2019s Anscombe Society, Thomas Clark, notes that the campaign encourages young men and women while they combat the hookup culture.\n\n\u201cOften we hear news about bad relationships on campus,\u201d Clark told The Daily Signal, referencing recent Princeton University sexual assault reports. \u201cThere\u2019s lots of bad news, but there\u2019s plenty of action to be taken as well. There is still good news.\u201d\n\nJames Lopez, a full-time worker and graduate student at Biola University, notes that the Bring Dating Back campaign\u2019s flower giveaway has brought happiness to his campus.\n\n\u201cWe see a lot of happy faces and a lot of smiles,\u201d he told The Daily Signal. \u201cA lot of people find the courage to give a girl a flower.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn Sunday we pass out candy with a note saying, \u2018Don\u2019t be just a night, you\u2019re worth a lifetime,\u2019\u201d Nate Eggleston, a junior at the University of Pittsburgh, told The Daily Signal.\n\n\u201cLast year we used up two big boxes of candy in half an hour,\u201d he added. \u201cWe made a lot of people\u2019s day.\u201d\n\nEggleston says the campaign addresses a very real fear of dating among students.\n\n\u201cI tell people it\u2019s hard, you are going to mess up, but it won\u2019t be as embarrassing as you imagine it to be,\u201d he said.\n\nEggleston survived the perils of dating and is now engaged to an engineering major at Carnegie Mellon University.\n\nEleanor Debreu, a senior and music major at Columbia University, told The Daily Signal that time commitment is also a dating deterrent.\n\n\u201cColumbia students are always busy. We think in terms of time. You want to do things that are worth your time. Do you have time for a casual date?\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cMy answer is, go for it. You can get to know someone and not have to get romantically involved,\u201d she said. \u201cIt makes us human, having these conversations and getting to know each other.\u201d\n\nThough the campaign is too new to boast statistical results, students hope that it helps others think seriously about how they approach relationships.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t seen the effects yet,\u201d Debreu said. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s helping in a subtle way. It makes people think about how they approach things and how they think about dating.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "\u201cWe\u2019re here to propose a new script that says an invitation to coffee isn\u2019t a marriage proposal, just a way to get to know someone,\u201d Caitlin La Ruffa says.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "\u201cWe\u2019re here to propose a new script that says an invitation to coffee isn\u2019t a marriage proposal, just a way to get to know someone,\u201d Caitlin La Ruffa says.", "title": "These Students Encourage Dating Over Hookup Culture", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160211_ValentinesDayCampaign_Mork.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-12T15:18:51+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1PrzARh"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "\u201cWe\u2019re here to propose a new script that says an invitation to coffee isn\u2019t a marriage proposal, just a way to get to know someone,\u201d Caitlin La Ruffa says.", "title": "These Students Encourage Dating Over Hookup Culture", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160211_ValentinesDayCampaign_Mork.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "Marriage & Family", "published_time": "2016-02-12T13:56:17+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-12T15:18:51+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Valentine's Day, Love and Fidelity Network, dating, valentine, bring dating back, marriage, family, sexual integrityromance, colleges, advice"}, "article_summary": "Eleanor Debreu, a senior and music major at Columbia University, told The Daily Signal that time commitment is also a dating deterrent.\nIt\u2019s a problem of narrative, Caitlin La Ruffa, executive director of the Love and Fidelity Network, told The Daily Signal.\n\u201cWe made a lot of people\u2019s day.\u201dEggleston says the campaign addresses a very real fear of dating among students.\nStudents at 36 schools across the country are campaigning to bring back dating just in time for Valentine\u2019s Day.\n\u201cWe see a lot of happy faces and a lot of smiles,\u201d he told The Daily Signal."}
