So we can reasonably assume that New York Times executive editor Dean Baquet has some deeply conflicted emotions regarding the Gray Lady\u2019s decision to not run the cartoons published by Charlie Hebdo.\n\n\u201cExactly how many people have to be shot in cold blood before your paper rules that you can show us what provoked the killers? Apparently 23 shot including 11 dead is not enough. What absolute cowardice. These MSM managers act is if they are running insurance companies, not news organizations.\"\n\nBaquet fired back, also in comments:\n\n\u201cDear Marc, appreciate the self righteous second guessing without even considering there might be another point of view,\u201d Baquet said in a comment on Cooper\u2019s Facebook page. \u201cHope your students are more open minded. Asshole.\u201d \u201cOf course there is a second view,\u201d Baquet said in another comment. \u201cAnd I welcome it. But your note was thoughtless and arrogant. It didn\u2019t invite argument. It invites so what you got [sic].\u201d\n\nThis is an astonishing response to legitimate criticism from an academic authority. Does Baquet seriously contend that the standard he enforces at the New York Times is to invite argument whenever an opinion or criticism is expressed? Does he guide his subordinates to always consider that there might be another point of view? How, then, to explain?\n\nIn a statement to Politico, which broke the story of his descent to the gutter, Baquet dug his hole even deeper:\n\n\"We have a standard that is pretty simple. We don't run things that are designed to gratuitously offend,\" Baquet told POLITICO at the time. \"[O]bviously [I] don't expect all to agree. But let's not forget the Muslim family in Brooklyn who read us and is offended by any depiction of what he sees as his prophet. I don't give a damn about the head of ISIS but I do care about that family and it is arrogant to ignore them.\"\n\nThe problem with this statement is that it is easily proven false. Offending Jews is no problem at all to the Times. The Allgemeiner writes:\n\nas POLITICO pointed out, \u201cin August 2010, the Times published this item about a Holocaust-denying Iranian cartoonist with an image of a cartoon that featured, in the Times\u2019 words, \u2018anti-Jewish caricatures.\u2019 Four years earlier, in 2006, the Times published this article about an Iranian exhibition of \u2018anti-Jewish art,\u2019 which featured a photograph of three anti-Semitic cartoons, one of which included a swastika.\u201d POLITICO also noted that in 1999, \u201cthe Times ran a report with a photo of Chris Ofili\u2019s \u2018The Holy Virgin Mary,\u2019 a 1996 painting of a black Madonna \u2018with a clump of elephant dung on one breast and cutouts of genitalia from pornographic magazines in the background.\u2019 Per the report, John Cardinal O\u2019Connor called the show an attack on religion itself. The Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights said it found Ofili\u2019s painting offensive, too.\u201d\n\nBaquet appears to be in violation of the Times\u2019 own standards regarding social media. The Daily Caller points out:\n\nThe NYT\u2018 social media rules from Philip Corbett, associate managing editor for standards, in a 2012 internal memo are as follows: First, we should always treat Twitter, Facebook and other social media platforms as public activities. Regardless of your privacy controls or the size of your follower list, anything you post online can easily be shared with a wider audience. And second, you are a Times journalist, and your online behavior should be appropriate for a Times journalist. Readers will inevitably associate anything you post on social media with The Times. Newsroom staff members should avoid editorializing or promoting political views. And we should be civil \u2013 even to critics \u2013 and avoid personal attacks and offensive remarks. Civility applies whether an exchange takes place in person, by telephone, by letter or online.\n\nThe ball is now in the court of NYT publisher Pinch Sulzberger. If he deems \u201casshole\u201d to be \u201coffensive,\u201d then it would seem that Baquet needs disciplining. If none is forthcoming, then we can deem the term acceptable according to that paper\u2019s own standards, as is a double standard on offending Jews versus Muslims.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2015/01/nyt_exec_editor_calls_mohammed_cartoon_censorship_critic_asshole.html", "image": "http://www.americanthinker.com/images/bucket/2015-01/193841_5_.jpg", "title": "Blog: NYT exec editor calls Mohammed cartoon censorship critic 'asshole'"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Asshole.\u201d \u201cOf course there is a second view,\u201d Baquet said in another comment.\nThe Daily Caller points out:The NYT\u2018 social media rules from Philip Corbett, associate managing editor for standards, in a 2012 internal memo are as follows: First, we should always treat Twitter, Facebook and other social media platforms as public activities.\nReaders will inevitably associate anything you post on social media with The Times.\nThe Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights said it found Ofili\u2019s painting offensive, too.\u201dBaquet appears to be in violation of the Times\u2019 own standards regarding social media.\nBaquet fired back, also in comments:\u201cDear Marc, appreciate the self righteous second guessing without even considering there might be another point of view,\u201d Baquet said in a comment on Cooper\u2019s Facebook page."}
