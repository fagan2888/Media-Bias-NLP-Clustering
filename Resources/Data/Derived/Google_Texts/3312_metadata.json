Other candidates lie, of course, but they at least go to the trouble of dressing up their lies with weasel words and other forms of qualifying language that allow them to squirm their way out of fact checks. Fiorina doesn\u2019t care about any of that. She makes firm, declarative statements that are unquestionably inaccurate, and when confronted with inarguable facts that prove her wrong, she insists against all evidence that she is correct and bristles at the very notion that anyone might challenger her. She does not care. She does not pretend to care. As far as Fiorina\u2019s concerned, the fact that she said it is what makes it true.\n\nUp until this week, the prime example of this phenomenon was the Planned Parenthood video she claimed to have seen showing \u201ca fully formed fetus on the table, its heart beating, its legs kicking while someone says, \u2018We have to keep it alive to harvest its brain.\u2019\u201d That video doesn\u2019t exist, and when confronted with the truth, she insisted her lie was true and lashed out at her critics with wholly un-righteous umbrage. \u201cI\u2019ve seen the footage. And I find it amazing, actually, that all these supposed fact-checkers in the mainstream media claim this doesn\u2019t exist.\u201d\n\nThat already egregious example of gross fibbery has, implausibly, been supplanted by an even larger whopper. At this week\u2019s Republican debate, Fiorina listed off a number of retired generals \u2013 \u201cPetraeus, McChrystal, Mattis, Keane, Flynn\u201d \u2013 whom she would \u201cbring back\u201d into service. \u201cEvery one was retired early because they told President Obama things that he didn\u2019t want to hear,\u201d she said. Citing David Petraeus made absolutely no sense \u2013 he retired because Obama nominated him as CIA director, and then he resigned because of a security breach related to the extramarital affair he was having. But invoking Gen. Jack Keane was the real howler of the bunch, given that he retired in 2003, a full five years before Obama was elected president. Keane confirmed to Fox News that he\u2019s never even spoken to President Obama, and that Fiorina\u2019s assessment was \u201cnot accurate.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "There's really no need to dance around the unquestioned truth that Carly Fiorina lies about stuff", "author": "Simon Maloy", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "There's really no need to dance around the unquestioned truth that Carly Fiorina lies about stuff", "title": "Carly Fiorina is a liar: And everyone should finally just say it \u2014 loudly", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/12/17/carly_fiorina_is_a_liar_and_everyone_should_finally_just_say_it_loudly/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/12/carly_fiorina5.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "There's really no need to dance around the unquestioned truth that Carly Fiorina lies about stuff", "creator": "@SimonMaloy", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/12/carly_fiorina5.jpg", "title": "Carly Fiorina is a liar: And everyone should finally just say it \u2014 loudly", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Carly Fiorina is a liar: And everyone should finally just say it \u2014 loudly", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 2016 Elections, 2016 GOP primary, 2016 Republican primary, aol_on, Carly Fiorina, David Petraeus, gen. jack keane, Media Critcism, National security, Planned Parenthood, Republicans", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Fiorina doesn\u2019t care about any of that.\nKeane confirmed to Fox News that he\u2019s never even spoken to President Obama, and that Fiorina\u2019s assessment was \u201cnot accurate.\u201d\n\u201cEvery one was retired early because they told President Obama things that he didn\u2019t want to hear,\u201d she said.\nAt this week\u2019s Republican debate, Fiorina listed off a number of retired generals \u2013 \u201cPetraeus, McChrystal, Mattis, Keane, Flynn\u201d \u2013 whom she would \u201cbring back\u201d into service.\nTopics: 2016 Elections, 2016 GOP primary, 2016 Republican primary, aol_on, Carly Fiorina, David Petraeus, gen. jack keane, Media Critcism, National security, Planned Parenthood, Republicans, Media News, Politics NewsCarly Fiorina is unique among all the candidates in the Republican presidential field for her visceral, aggressive hatred for anything resembling truth."}
