After eight straight Powerball drawings without a jackpot winner, will the ninth one be the charm?

Time to check your tickets to see if the losing streak is over. Here are the winning Powerball numbers drawn at 11 p.m. on Saturday, Sept. 7: 2-19-22-26-45, and the Powerball selected was 24.

Over the past month, the jackpot has risen steadily, making Saturday's top prize worth $203 million, or $115.5 million if the cash option is chosen.

During the last drawing, Wednesday night, no tickets matched all the winning numbers (2-9-26-45,47; Powerball 11). Tickets sold in nine states matched five numbers, but not the Powerball and are worth $1 million before taxes.

Meanwhile, a Mega Millions ticket sold in the Garden State just missed hitting Tuesday's $95 million jackpot. The ticket bought at J.Y.C.D. Deli & Grocery on Commerical Avenue in New Brunswick contained five numbers and is worth $250,000, lottery officials said.

The winning numbers drawn were: 4, 13,14, 28 and 41. The Gold Mega Ball was 28 and the Megaplier Multiplier was 3.

Though there wasn't a $1 million ticket sold in New Jersey for the most recent Powerball drawing, someone who bought a ticket in Bloomfield won that amount in the Aug. 31 drawing.
