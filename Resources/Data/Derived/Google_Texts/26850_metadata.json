Of this amount, the hospital administration says $3.7 million went to operations and nearly $2 million for physician and program development in 2014-15, representing nearly $6 million.\n\nAccording to the audit, these expenditures were described as \u201cnot in direct relation to its purpose as written on the ballot,\u201d which was placed before parish voters on April 21, 2012.\n\nIn its response in the audit, the hospital administration states, \u201cAs a small rural hospital, it has become very difficult to operate in such a volatile healthcare environment. With the implementation of the Affordable Care Act (better known as Obamacare) and continued federal mandates, we are exploring some form of affiliation with a larger healthcare system.\u201d\n\nBy Sept. 1, 2014, the Luling hospital was being managed by Ochsner Health System.", "article_metadata": {"Description": "Although a state Legislative Auditor\u0092s report says otherwise, St. Charles Parish Hospital management maintains the public was informed about how it spent about $6 million on operational costs.", "og": {"site_name": "St. Charles Herald-Guide", "description": "Although a state Legislative Auditor\u0092s report says otherwise, St. Charles Parish Hospital management maintains the public was informed about how it spent about $6 million on operational costs.", "title": "St. Charles Parish Hospital disagrees it misspent $6M in bond issue, but repaid the money", "url": "http://www.heraldguide.com/details.php?id=15670", "image": "http://www.heraldguide.com/pics/p1432930336.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Although a state Legislative Auditor\u0092s report says otherwise, St. Charles Parish Hospital management maintains the public was informed about how it spent about $6 million on operational costs.", "title": "St. Charles Parish Hospital disagrees it misspent $6M in bond issue, but repaid the money", "url": "http://www.heraldguide.com/details.php?id=15670", "image": "http://www.heraldguide.com/pics/med/p1432930336.jpg", "site": "@stcharlesherald", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 12602084}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/heraldguide"}, "subject": "Although a state Legislative Auditor\u0092s report says otherwise, St. Charles Parish Hospital management maintains the public was informed about how it spent about $6 million on operational costs."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb32d\"", "article_summary": "St. Charles Parish Hospital disagrees it misspent $6M in bond issue, but repaid the moneyMay 29, 2015 at 2:47 pm | Print May 29, 2015 at 2:47 pm | Mobile ReaderAlthough a state Legislative Auditor\u0092s report says otherwise, St. Charles Parish Hospital management maintains the public was informed about how it spent about $6 million on operational costs.\n\u201cWe are pleased that the audit findings noted in the 2013 audit were remedied,\u201d said hospital CEO Fred Martinez.In 2012, St. Charles Parish Hospital issued $14 million in bonds for purchasing, acquiring and constructing, land, buildings, machinery, equipment and furnishings for hospital facilities.\nIn response to labeling the move as \u201cimproper\u201d and calling for fund reimbursement, the Luling hospital repaid the money in full by March.\nIn its response in the audit, the hospital administration states, \u201cAs a small rural hospital, it has become very difficult to operate in such a volatile healthcare environment.\n\u201cDuring numerous public presentations prior to the bond election, the hospital informed the public that a substantial use of these bond proceeds would be used for physician and new service line development,\u201d said hospital spokesman Quinn Landry."}
