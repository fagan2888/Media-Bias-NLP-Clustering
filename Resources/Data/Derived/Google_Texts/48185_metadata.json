If it\u2019s a crow or a jay, the district sends out a team to collect the bird and bring it back to their in-house lab to test it for West Nile Virus. If the bird tests positive, a team of five technicians in white pick-up trucks goes out and sets 40 mosquito traps in a one-mile radius of the site. At this point, Dr. Noor Tietze, Entomologist is called in for mapping and planning strategies. After one night of trapping, the team returns in their white pick-up trucks to collect the mosquitoes and bring them back for testing.\n\n\u201cIf we get any positive mosquitoes, we go to the next step and fog the area,\u201d said Tietze. They spray with Ultra Low Volume (ULV) fog, an insecticide strong enough to knock down the mosquito population by 60-80 percent but mild enough to use in residential areas. In case this brings to mind \u201cSilent Spring\u201d images of children running behind a DDT truck and polluting their lungs, you should know that Tietze\u2019s trucks only put out 1.5 fluid ounces per acre, not enough to affect honeybees or dragonflies, much less larger mammals like us.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re quite busy right now,\u201d Tietze said, chuckling. On May 27, the district tested five positive crows in one day, which led to another fogging in Sunnyvale on June 2 at night.\n\nWest Nile is now prevalent in California, and has been for some time. In late April, a dead American crow in Contra Costa County tested positive for the disease. This is the one of the earliest cases of West Nile in the mosquito season that has announced itself in the Bay Area to date.\n\nIn 2013, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 176 cases of West Nile Virus in California, six of which were fatal. Two of those 176 cases were right in Santa Clara County \u2014 fortunately, they were non-fatal. Still, infectious disease experts warn that if we don\u2019t take preventative measures soon, climate change could make the virus a whole lot worse.\n\n\u201cFortunately, it\u2019s not a super virulent virus. That is, not most of the people who get West Nile don\u2019t show symptoms,\u201d said Steve Schutz, scientific program manager at the Contra Costa County Mosquito and Vector Control District. \u201cBut for the few who do, it can be very serious.\u201d\n\nRecently, with drought and warming temperatures, concern around West Nile has been the highest that it has been since its initial spread to California. We have entered a new era where reports of tropical disease no longer mean you\u2019re safe at home \u2014 those reports could be right from your backyard.\n\nA tropical disease in your backyard\n\nWest Nile Virus used to be a disease of tropical birds, carried between birds by mosquitoes. The Culex family of mosquitoes has carried West Nile from birds to humans, allowing the virus to spill over into human hosts in a zoonosis \u2014 a term that describes the transmission of a disease between species.\n\nWhile roughly 75 to 80 percent of those infected with West Nile Virus don\u2019t show symptoms, the rest develop West Nile Fever. They can experience fever, headache and nausea among other symptoms. But the real problem is West Nile Encephalitis \u2014 a rare complication that happens in less than one percent of people who get infected. West Nile Encephalitis is a serious disease that affects the brain, with a frightening case fatality level of 4 to 15 percent. The scariest part: there is no known treatment for West Nile Virus.\n\nWest Nile first showed up in the United States in New York in 1999. Schutz suspects it spilled over to the U.S. via illegal birds in the illegal pet trade. Other hypotheses pose that mosquitoes may have hitched rides to New York on airplanes with the spread of globalization.\n\n\u201cOnce it was here, it turned out that some of our local birds were highly susceptible to it. North American birds had never been exposed and had no immunity,\u201d Schutz explained. Once infected, all it took was several bird migrations for the disease to spread coast to coast.\n\nClimate change now threatens to spread West Nile further. West Nile is, remember, a tropical disease. As the mercury rises, so does the incidence of the disease.\n\nSummer nights make happy mosquitoes\n\nWith decreased and more variable water supplies, birds and mosquitoes bottleneck around what few water supplies are available, increasing contact between the two species. Birds are the middlemen between mosquitoes and humans, essentially storing the virus and letting it incubate until a second mosquito bites the bird and ferries the virus along to human hosts. The scarcer the water supply, the more opportunities for contact between birds and mosquitoes, the more the virus can amplify, the greater chance of infection in human hosts.\n\n\u201cIn California, there was already background rainfall variability in dry areas,\u201d said William Durham, professor of infectious disease at Stanford University. \u201cIf climate change is adding variation to that, birds and mosquitoes will have fewer choices for water sources and standing water anywhere could become a breeding ground for West Nile.\u201d\n\nHigher temperatures make matters even worse.\n\n\u201cSince mosquitoes are cold-blooded, they\u2019re pretty much the same temperature as their surroundings,\u201d said Schutz. \u201cThe warmer the mosquitoes are, the faster the virus can replicate inside the mosquito. The virus migrates from gut of the mosquito to its salivary glands and amplifies. The warmer that is, the faster that happens,\u201d he explained.\n\nIn addition to allowing the virus to amplify more quickly, warmer temperatures extend the window when mosquitoes can be out biting humans each day. With warmer mornings and evenings, the time when the temperature is mild enough for mosquitoes to be out biting will be longer, increasing the possibility of transmission to human hosts. With warmer summers, the Culex will be able to develop more rapidly, too.\n\nWarmer temperatures have favored the Culex mosquito and have also led to the appearance of new families of tropical mosquitoes that are non-native to the Bay Area. Recently, the vector control districts in San Mateo and Fresno found some non-native tropical mosquitoes that are capable of transmitting Dengue and Yellow Fever.\n\nThe mosquitoes likely make it to California on airplanes, and once they\u2019re here, where once they would have perished because of a foreign climate, our warming climate is allowing them to survive, and maybe someday even thrive.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see it being an immediate impact,\u201d said Schutz. \u201cBut I think over the long term, if we do start having milder winters or warmer evenings, when it doesn\u2019t cool down as much overnight, that potentially is going to increase transmission of West Nile Virus. The warmer it gets, the easier it will be for these tropical mosquitoes to colonize the Bay Area, too.\u201d\n\nBefore you grab the bug spray\n\nTo protect against West Nile, the public needs to understand all the factors that are pushing infection rates up. And certain human activities are complementing the effects of climate change in alarming and unexpected ways.\n\n\u201cNeglected swimming pools could be a major part of the problem,\u201d said Durham.\n\nThe year 2007 marked one of the first years that disease control experts saw a spike in West Nile in the Bay Area, especially in Santa Clara County. One of Durham\u2019s hypotheses to explain the spike is the host of abandoned swimming pools left behind by the subprime mortgage crisis. This is a narrow case of a broader problem\u2014man-made standing water sources.\n\n\u201cOne thing that comes up is hoarding water,\u201d said Tietze. \u201cEspecially with late rains, people may have collected quite a bit of water in their backyards. If that water isn\u2019t covered properly it could create a breeding ground for Culex pipiens.\u201d\n\nSwimming pools, uncovered buckets that have collected water and birdbaths: the stakes of cleaning, or emptying, these water sources are much higher than those of your typical household chore. Even standing water in clogged gutters could be a threat.\n\nIn terms of protection measures, this is a good place to start. Check your backyard. Check your neighbor\u2019s backyard.\n\nBeyond controlling man-made sources of standing water and prudent use of mosquito repellent, the next step to control West Nile is the ULV fog that Tietze and his team spray neighborhoods with. Especially when disease control centers resort to fogging residential areas with insecticide, people will begin to see the high stakes of fighting diseases like West Nile.\n\n\u201cPublic concern is high,\u201d said Durham. \u201cWhen West Nile Virus comes whistling in, public health officials spray. They\u2019ve already sprayed areas of San Jose and Morgan Hill. You start to wonder how much control you have if your kids are going to breathe that stuff.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople have questions because it\u2019s something different,\u201d Tietze explained. \u201cWe only fog one night. Other areas in the country, they may do it several nights in a row.\u201d For now, it\u2019s our only option.\n\nWest Nile Virus is an alarming example of the effects of climate change that we\u2019ve already baked into our system. Reducing carbon emissions isn\u2019t going to retroactively push temperatures back down. The effects of climate change \u2014 West Nile among them \u2014 are here to stay. And it\u2019s up to us to find creative, sustainable ways to adapt to those effects.\n\nHomepage mosquito photo courtesy of \u201ck yamada\u201d via Flickr.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "climate change,Environment,mosquito,mosquitoes,Renee Donovan,summer,West Nile virus,Culture & Features,Science & Tech,Features,Frontpage Featured,Parks & Recreation,Politics & Gov", "description": "The local threat of West Nile Virus is high.
