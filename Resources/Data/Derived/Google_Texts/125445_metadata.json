(Republican Eagle photo by Joe Brown)\n\nMiesville has made a habit of hitting the cover off the ball the last two weeks.\n\nFresh off a 14-5 victory against Classic Cannon Valley League rival Red Wing in the annual Fourth of July game, the Mudhens have outscored opponents 58-16 while rattling off five straight victories.\n\n\u201cEven today, missing four of our starters, we\u2019ve been having really good at-bats,\u201d said Miesville manager/third baseman Chris Olean. \u201cThis is a really good lineup when we have everyone; we shouldn\u2019t need an old guy like me at third base. We have more veteran-type hitters who can grind out at-bats.\u201d\n\nLooking for payback after a 5-3 loss to the Aces on Memorial Day, the Mudhens wasted little time in jumping out to a 5-0 lead. Pounding Red Wing starting pitcher Brady Schroeder for four hits in the opening frame, Deryk Marks and Charles Bruchu did the most damage with both collecting two-run doubles.\n\nThe Aces showed some resilience after that initial shellshock with a two-run bottom of the first. Leadoff batter Adam Thygesen scored on a wild pitch while Mitch Matter crossed home on a Kyle Blahnik groundout.\n\nThat offensive spurt was short-lived as Steve Maher\u2019s slider gave Red Wing fits as he had seven strikeouts in 7 1/3 innings.\n\n\u201c(Maher) was having trouble locating his fastball early, so we were going to his slider early in the court,\u201d said Miesville catcher Nate Hammes.\n\nRed Wing assistant manager/center fielder Steve Boldt added, \u201cWe were able to weather some of the storm early, but that first inning got away from us.\u201d\n\nWhile the Aces\u2019 offense was busy trying to find answers, the Mudhens continued to bash the ball around the Red Wing Athletic Field with Hammes (4-for-5, four runs) and Bruchu (3-for-5, five RBI) doing the bulk of the damage from the No. 5 and 6 spots.\n\n\u201cI really like having Chuck bat behind me,\u201d Hammes said. \u201cBetween at-bats, he\u2019ll tell me, \u2018I\u2019ll going to do this when I\u2019m up,\u2019 and we can play off of each other. It\u2019s nice to have someone bat behind you that has such easy power.\u201d\n\nThe Miesville twosome of Hammes and Bruchu were hardly the only batters hitting the seams off the ball. Matt Van Der Bosch (2-for-4, three runs), Marks (3-for-5, two runs, four RBI) and Olean (2-for-4) also had multi-hit games as the Mudhens belted out 18 hits as a team. Jordy Horsch added two runs from the leadoff spot and Alex LaShomb drove in two more runs for Miesville.\n\n\u201cThey definitely came out swinging,\u201d Boldt said. \u201cThey\u2019re a good team and with an offense like that, they\u2019re a challenge for any team.\u201d\n\nBoldt and Adam Thygesen both finished with two hits and a run, and Ty Buck came up with a double and a run scored in the seventh inning. Josh Thygesen plated a run for the Aces after Boldt was hit by a pitch with the bases loaded.\n\nBoth teams were back in action on Sunday with Miesville (13-5) taking on Randolph and Red Wing (9-7) hosting Lake City.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "sports,amateur,Baseball,Red Wing Aces,miesville mudhens,social", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Joe Brown", "og": {"site_name": "Republican Eagle", "description": "Miesville has made a habit of hitting the cover off the ball the last two weeks. \r\n\r\nFresh off a 14-5 victory against Classic Cannon Valley League rival Red Wing in the annual Fourth of July game, the Mudhens have outscored opponents 58-16 while rattling off five straight victories. \r\n\r\n\u201cEven toda...", "title": "Amateur Baseball: Miesville bashes Red Wing in Independence Day...", "url": "http://www.republican-eagle.com/sports/amateur/3779788-amateur-baseball-miesville-bashes-red-wing-independence-day-battle", "image": {"width": 300, "identifier": "http://www.republican-eagle.com/sites/default/files/styles/square_300/public/field/image/Steve%20Maher_0.jpg?itok=MzSw3JA2", "height": 300}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Miesville has made a habit of hitting the cover off the ball the last two weeks. \r\n\r\nFresh off a 14-5 victory against Classic Cannon Valley League rival Red Wing in the annual Fourth of July game, the Mudhens have outscored opponents 58-16 while rattling off five straight victories. \r\n\r\n\u201cEven toda...", "title": "Amateur Baseball: Miesville bashes Red Wing in Independence Day...", "url": "http://www.republican-eagle.com/sports/amateur/3779788-amateur-baseball-miesville-bashes-red-wing-independence-day-battle", "image": "http://www.republican-eagle.com/sites/default/files/styles/16x9_430/public/field/image/Steve%20Maher_0.jpg?itok=34FnBfHe", "site": "republicaneagle", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 243322109167890}, "keywords": "sports,amateur,Baseball,Red Wing Aces,miesville mudhens,social", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/redwingrepublicaneagle", "tag": "sports,amateur,Baseball,Red Wing Aces,miesville mudhens,social", "modified_time": "2015-07-05T14:41:47-05:00"}, "image": {"alt": "Miesville starting pitcher Steve Maher fires off a throw during the third inning of Saturday's Independence Day game against Red Wing at the Red Wing Athletic Field.
