Bloomberg News\n\nCongressional Budget Office Director Keith Hall testified before the House Budget Committee last week about how dynamic scoring\u2013considering macroeconomic effects of legislative proposals\u2013affects the agency\u2019s work. It could have a major effect on entitlement spending proposals.\n\nMost of the debate over dynamic scoring has focused on the economic impact of tax cuts and government spending. Dr. Hall\u2019s testimony highlighted a less discussed but equally important related element: the way that means-tested government programs lower economic growth by effectively raising marginal tax rates. For instance, a single mother making $20,000 per year might pay not only 15 cents in taxes for every additional dollar of income raised; her eligibility for food stamps, Medicaid, and the Earned Income Tax Credit might also be reduced or eliminated. The Urban Institute\u2019s Gene Steuerle has calculated that these programs amount to a \u201cpoverty trap\u201d for families of modest means by taking away as much as 80 cents out of every dollar in added income through a combination of higher taxes and reduced government benefits.\n\nCBO has conducted two analyses related to Obamacare that showed that the health law would exacerbate this\u2014discouraging work and reducing the size of the labor force. The first analysis, released in August 2010, found that the law would reduce the U.S. work force by about half of one percentage point\u2013the equivalent of approximately 800,000 workers by 2021. The second, released in February 2014, roughly tripled that estimate to 1.5% to 2% of the labor force, or about 2.3 million workers in 2021.\n\nI have written previously about CBO\u2019s analysis of the Affordable Care Act and the impact of dynamic scoring under the agency\u2019s previous director, Doug Elmendorf. In his testimony last week, Dr. Hall said that the reduction in government revenues caused by the way Obamacare discourages work is likely to lower the cost of repealing the law.\n\nAs Dr. Hall noted, these are early days for CBO\u2019s obligations of dynamic scoring for major legislation. But to the extent that debates over dynamic scoring focus on whether tax cuts or economic stimulus measures \u201cpay for themselves\u201d through greater economic growth, they miss an important issue. The poverty trap that government policies have created \u2014 and possibly was exacerbated by Obamacare \u2014 by providing a disincentive for people to take on initiatives that might raise their incomes impedes economic growth and hinders the ability of millions of Americans to achieve their dreams.\n\nChris Jacobs is policy director of America Next, a conservative think tank.
