There is no information, no pictures. It's not transparent,\" Abdulkarim told Reuters in an interview in Vienna.\n\n\"They should change their approach. They told us, we cannot (do this) because our law (prohibits) us from declaring what we have,\" he said.\n\nA Turkish Culture Ministry spokesman said Abdulkarim's allegations were \"baseless\".\n\n\"Some Syrian antiquities may have been smuggled to Turkey ... We are doing our best to prevent such smuggling,\" he said.\n\n\"Whenever we seize such antiquities we return them to the related country's institutions. We trained our border police on the issue very recently. I think those allegations are politically motivated,\" the Turkish official said.\n\nPERMITS ISSUED BY ISLAMIC STATE\n\nThe 2,000 objects seized in Turkey compare with 6,500 recovered by Syrian authorities from smugglers, 300 seized by Jordanian authorities and 90 returned to Syria from Lebanon since the beginning of the war, according to Abdulkarim.\n\nHe said that the absence of relations between Syria and Israel meant no information about looted objects found there was reaching him either.\n\nAbdulkarim described permits issued to looters by Islamic State, also known as Daesh, in exchange for a cut of their profits. Equipped with these documents, looters could trawl sites such as Mari or nearby Dura Europos with bulldozers in search of artifacts to smuggle to Turkey.\n\n\"Last month we received these documents (that say) 'State of Daesh', the Department for Archeology gives this person the permission to do whatever excavation he wants at this site,\" Abdulkarim said.\n\nLooting began on a large scale in 2013, and nothing has changed on the ground since a United Nations resolution protecting Syrian and Iraqi heritage sites passed in February, he said.\n\n\"We need European countries, the United States, Japan (and others) to convince those who buy our artifacts to refuse them,\" Abdulkarim said.\n\nBuyers of such objects live in Britain, the United States, Arab Gulf countries, China, France, Germany and Switzerland, he said. \"If you buy our artifacts, you support Daesh.\"\n\n(Additional reporting by Ercan Gurses in Ankara; editing by Estelle Shirbon)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "VIENNA (Reuters) - Syria's antiquities chief has accused Turkey of refusing to return", "title": "Syrian antiquities chief says Turkey refuses to return looted art", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/12/11/Syrian-antiquities-chief-says-Turkey-refuses-return-looted-art", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/mideast-crisis-syria-palmyra_2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/12/11/Syrian-antiquities-chief-says-Turkey-refuses-return-looted-art", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/mideast-crisis-syria-palmyra_2.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "VIENNA (Reuters) - Syria's antiquities chief has accused Turkey of refusing to return", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "VIENNA (Reuters) - Syria's antiquities chief has accused Turkey of refusing to return looted objects from ancient heritage sites in Syria or to provide information about them, allegations denied by the Turkish government.\nAbdulkarim described permits issued to looters by Islamic State, also known as Daesh, in exchange for a cut of their profits.\n\"Some Syrian antiquities may have been smuggled to Turkey ...
