Are you committed to the mere opportunity to choose, or will you also insist that people actually exercise that opportunity? Is it enough if the government, or a private institution, gives people the option of going their own way? Or is it particularly important to get people to say precisely what they want? In coming decades, these seemingly abstract questions will grow in importance, because they will decide central features of our lives.\n\nIf employees are required to make choices about their retirement or health care plans, many of them will become educated about those topics. That may serve them well for the rest of their lives.\n\nHere\u2019s an example. Until last month, all 50 states had a simple policy for voter registration: If you want to become a voter, you have the opportunity to register. Oregon is now the first state to adopt a radically different approach: If the relevant state officials know that you live in Oregon and are 18 or older, you\u2019re automatically registered as a voter. If you don\u2019t want to be one, you have the opportunity to opt out.\n\nWe could easily imagine a third approach. A state might decide that if you want some kind of benefit \u2014 say, a driver\u2019s license \u2014 you have to say whether you want to register to vote. Under this approach, the state would require you to make an active choice about whether to be a voter. You would have to indicate your desires explicitly.\n\nIn countless contexts, the government, or some private institution, must decide among three possible approaches: Give people the opportunity to opt in; give people the opportunity to opt out; or require people to make some kind of active choice. For example, an employer may say that employees will be enrolled in a pension plan only if they opt in. Alternatively, it may automatically enroll employees in a pension plan (while allowing them the opportunity to opt out). Or it may instead tell employees that they can\u2019t start work unless they say whether they want to participate in a pension plan.\n\nYou may think that while the decision raises philosophical puzzles, the stakes are small. If so, you would be wrong; the decision can have huge consequences. By itself, the opportunity to choose is not all that matters, because many people will not exercise that opportunity. Inertia has tremendous force, and people tend to procrastinate. If a state or a private company switches from a system of opt-out to one of opt-in, or vice versa, it can have major effects on people\u2019s lives.\n\nFor example, Oregon expects that its new policy will produce up to 300,000 new registered voters. In 2004, Congress authorized the Department of Agriculture to allow states and localities to automatically enroll eligible poor children in school meal programs, rather than requiring their parents to sign them up. As a result, millions of such children now have access to school meals. In many nations, including the United States, Britain and Denmark, automatic enrollment in pension plans has significantly increased the number of employees who participate in pension plans. The Affordable Care Act builds on this practice with a provision that will require large employers to enroll employees automatically in health insurance plans.\n\nJohn Stuart Mill believed that the \u2018mental and moral, like the muscular powers, are improved only by being used.\u2019\n\nIn light of findings of this kind (and there are many more), a lot of people have argued that people would be much better off if many institutions switched, today or tomorrow, from \u201copt in\u201d designs to \u201copt out.\u201d Often they\u2019re right; \u201copt out\u201d can be a lot better. But from the standpoint of both welfare and personal freedom, opt out raises problems of its own, precisely because it does not involve an actual exercise of the power to choose.\n\nSuppose, for example, that a state presumes that people will be organ donors \u2014 but allows them to opt out. A lot of people, or their family members, would be troubled to learn that the state has decided, without an active choice and explicit consent, that doctors can have access to their organs. Or suppose that a large employer, focused on the plight of the poor, says that its employees will be automatically enrolled in a charitable donation program \u2014 while also allowing them to opt out. Some employees might not be so thrilled to learn that if they do nothing, they will be giving some part of their paycheck to charity \u2014 and that a change will require them to undertake the unpleasant task of saying that they want to opt out of the program.\n\nWhich brings us directly to the idea of active choosing. With respect to organ donation, pension plans, health insurance, charitable donations, and much more, the government and private firms might not present people with any kind of default setting, but might instead ask people a question that is often welcome: What, exactly, do you want?\n\nIf we care about human welfare and personal autonomy, this approach has many advantages. In his great essay \u201cOn Liberty,\u201d John Stuart Mill argued that the individual \u201cis the person most interested in his own well-being,\u201d and that the \u201cordinary man or woman has means of knowledge immeasurably surpassing those that can be possessed by any one else.\u201d When society seeks to overrule the individual\u2019s judgment, Mill insisted, it does so on the basis of \u201cgeneral presumptions,\u201d and these \u201cmay be altogether wrong, and even if right, are as likely as not to be misapplied to individual cases.\u201d\n\nMill\u2019s concern was coercion, but his point applies to default settings as well. A private company or the state might lack the knowledge that individuals have. If we want outcomes to suit people\u2019s diverse situations, both opt in and opt out might go wrong, and active choosing has a great deal of appeal.\n\nMill had another argument on behalf of active choosing and against any use of default settings. In his account, the \u201chuman faculties of perception, judgment, discriminative feeling, mental activity are exercised only in making a choice.\u201d Mill believed that the \u201cmental and moral, like the muscular powers, are improved only by being used.\u201d If a government or a private institution asks people to make it an active choice, it ensures the exercise of the choice-making muscle.\n\nIf you were required to choose all your phone settings on your own, you might end up frustrated and bored. You might also make a lot of mistakes.\n\nThat can be important, because it promotes learning, self-development, and human agency. If employees are required to make choices about their retirement or health care plans, many of them will become educated about those topics. They will develop a kind of capital stock \u2014 one of knowledge. That stock might serve them well for the rest of their lives.\n\nBut we should not overstate these arguments. It would be a huge mistake to take them as all-purpose reasons to embrace active choosing in preference to default rules and the formal opportunity to choose. Return to Oregon\u2019s automatic registration law. Would it really be better if Oregon instead told people that they could not get driver\u2019s licenses unless they explicitly said whether they wanted to register to vote? Or have a look at your cellphone and your computer, both of which have a lot of default settings. If you were required to choose such settings on your own, you would have to spend a great deal of time thinking about which settings were best, and you might end up frustrated and bored. You might also make a lot of mistakes.\n\nThe central point is simple: Much of the time, sensible people choose not to choose. Indeed, that is an excellent way that we exercise our freedom and flex our choice-making muscles. We do it all the time.\n\nIn ordinary life, most of us delegate a certain amount of choice-making authority to spouses, doctors, lawyers, engineers and financial advisers. We do so when and because we do not want to take the time and trouble to make decisions ourselves, and when and because we know that we lack important information. We like it when a website allows us to check that blessed box that says \u201cdo not ask me again.\u201d If we are busy \u2014 and most of us are \u2014 choosing not to choose may be the best choice of all. A fundamental reason is that it frees us to focus on our deepest concerns.\n\nConsider the revealing words of President Obama: \u201cYou\u2019ll see I wear only gray or blue suits. I\u2019m trying to pare down decisions. I don\u2019t want to make decisions about what I\u2019m eating or wearing. Because I have too many other decisions to make.\u201d There is a lesson here for everyone, not merely presidents. If people were required to make active choices about all decisions involving their diets, their finances, or their health, they would have far less time to think about their families, their work, and their favorite forms of recreation.\n\nAs our institutions acquire growing amounts of data about what best suits people in their different situations, a lot of us might well become increasingly willing, even eager to choose not to choose. When is that a mistake? The answer depends mostly on two crucial factors: whether it is a big bother or instead interesting and fun to make a choice; and whether people are likely to be better or worse off if they make decisions on their own. If the question involves mystery novels, vacation spots, religious affiliations, political candidates, or romantic partners, most of us would do best to make active choices. But if the question involves computer settings, retirement plans, mortgages, or health insurance, good default rules can be a blessing, even an act of mercy, for a lot of us.\n\nRelated More From The Stone Read previous contributions to this series.\n\nSensibly enough, Oregon\u2019s automatic registration policy does not force people to choose. While giving them the opportunity to opt out, it turns them into voters by default. We ought to be focusing on other areas in which we now require people to opt in, if they want to enjoy valuable rights \u2014 and we ought to be asking whether it might make sense to make them rights-holders by default.\n\nCass R.
