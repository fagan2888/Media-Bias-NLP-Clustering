The Mound facility is teaming with the Old Log Theatre to present what is believed to be a first-of-its-kind public performance of an original radio drama starring senior citizens with memory loss, Alzheimer\u2019s disease or dementia.\n\nThe cast of \u201cPirates of Harrison Bay\u201d rehearsed Thursday.\n\n\u201cSojourn is 31 years old, and in those 31 years we\u2019ve never done anything like this before,\u201d said Kari Johnson, the center\u2019s program director. \u201cNo one has. To our knowledge, this is the first time anyone has put on a show in which the whole cast has variations of memory impairment.\u201d\n\nThe issues range from \u201cpeople who are just starting this journey to some who have lost an extensive amount of memory,\u201d she said. \u201cEveryone is dealing with some memory loss, but they\u2019re saying, \u2018Let\u2019s still do this play.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThe free show, which is at 1 p.m. Tuesday, is unique for another reason: It has not been tailored for its cast.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a regular radio script that was written for regular actors,\u201d Eckert said. \u201cThey have to pick up on the prose; they have to pick up on the cues. And it goes fast. This was not adapted for them in any way \u2014 and they\u2019re making it work.\u201d\n\nThe show grew out of one of the center\u2019s weekly activities, which is built around the radio shows of the 1930s and \u201940s. Some of the participants thought it might be fun to try their hand at radio acting.\n\nA daughter of one of the participants had worked with Eckert at the University of Minnesota, where the longtime broadcasting veteran produced weekly radio and TV programs. She reached out to him for help, and he showed up at the center one afternoon with a stack of old radio scripts ranging from the \u201cLux Radio Theater\u201d to \u201cFibber McGee and Molly.\u201d\n\n\u201cI brought them a little bit of everything \u2014 drama, mystery, romance,\u201d he said. \u201cThen, at the end, I said, \u2018Well, I have one more. It\u2019s a story I wrote myself.\u2019 \u201d\n\nIt was an immediate hit.\n\n\u201cWe all read it and we cried,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cWe said, \u2018This is us. This is who we are. This embodies our values.\u2019 \u201d\n\nSet on the shores of Lake Minnetonka, it\u2019s a story about a friendship between a boy and an old man. The boy rarely looks up from his cellphone until the man introduces him to the power of imagination. If he imagines hard enough, the man promises, he might even see the pirate ship that sometimes plies the foggy bay.\n\nPerformance primer\n\nThe show will be staged the way the original radio serials were, meaning that the actors will be working from their scripts, which are now covered with notes they\u2019ve made to themselves about the intonations and pacing of their lines. The one allowance being made for the 21st century is that the actors will be equipped with wireless microphones.\n\nAnticipating that many of the audience members will be too young to be familiar with radio plays, Eckert is going to start the 45-minute show by outlining what\u2019s about to happen.\n\n\u201cFor starters, I think I\u2019ll have to explain why the boy is being played by a woman,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is voice work. If it [the gender reversal] bothers you, close your eyes.\u201d\n\nGeri Bosch is the one tackling the role, and she\u2019s confident that she can handle it.\n\n\u201cI have five grandsons all that age,\u201d she said of her character, who\u2019s described in the script as being 7 or 8. \u201cI know that I need to bring a little exuberance to this. A couple of the boys will be there, and they\u2019ll see how much Grandma enjoys being like them.\u201d\n\nPirates of Harrison Bay What: Performance of radio play by seniors with memory issues. When: 1 p.m. Tue. Where: Old Log Theatre, 5185 Meadville St., Excelsior. Admission: Free. \u2022 Information: sojourngreatdays.com.\n\nThe play has 10 speaking roles. There also are 10 people in the chorus, plus another five in the orchestra.\n\n\u201cEveryone who wanted to be involved is doing something,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nThat took a little creativity. For instance, a role written for one narrator has been divided into four parts. Eckert was happy to make the accommodation, but that was the only one he was willing to indulge. He made it clear from the outset that, as far as the performance was concerned, he wasn\u2019t going to cut anyone any slack.\n\nDuring a rehearsal last week, he jumped in unhesitatingly, having the actors repeat lines until they got the inflection the way he wanted and running scenes over multiple times because someone was a beat late in picking up a cue.\n\nJohnson has been thrilled by his tough love.\n\n\u201cWe get to see a real director treat them as real actors,\u201d she said. \u201cMy insides jump for joy when I see that. These people don\u2019t want their dignity to be compromised.\u201d\n\nKaron Durhum, who plays the boy\u2019s mother, said she\u2019s proud to be in the show.\n\n\u201cIt makes me feel that I can give something back to people,\u201d she said.\n\nRobert Breen, one of the narrators, is coming away with a new appreciation of the effort necessary to hone a performance.\n\n\u201cIt takes a lot of practice,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd you really have to pay attention to the script\u201d or you\u2019ll be late delivering a line.\n\nThe work is paying off.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re doing this stuff,\u201d Eckert said excitedly. \u201cAnd they\u2019re doing it well. Their families are going to see them up on stage performing, and, when it\u2019s over, they\u2019re going to give them a standing ovation.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Writer/director J.", "og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "Writer/director J.", "title": "Twin Cities seniors with memory loss will perform radio play", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/twin-cities-seniors-with-memory-loss-will-perform-radio-play/329574131/", "image": {"url": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_144321225661777.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "width": 1200, "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_144321225661777.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Writer/director J.", "title": "Twin Cities seniors with memory loss will perform radio play", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/twin-cities-seniors-with-memory-loss-will-perform-radio-play/329574131/", "image": {"src": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_144321225661777.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_144321225661777.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "article": {"tag": "radio"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "news_keywords": "Alzheimer's Disease,dementia,theater,radio"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca1c1\"", "article_summary": "Their families are going to see them up on stage performing, and, when it\u2019s over, they\u2019re going to give them a standing ovation.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a regular radio script that was written for regular actors,\u201d Eckert said.\nA couple of the boys will be there, and they\u2019ll see how much Grandma enjoys being like them.\u201dPirates of Harrison Bay What: Performance of radio play by seniors with memory issues.\nSome of the participants thought it might be fun to try their hand at radio acting.\nWith Eckert\u2019s help, Sojourn Adult Day Services is putting on a show that it hopes will be hard to forget."}
