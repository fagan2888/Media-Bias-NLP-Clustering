Dodd-Frank was supposed to end \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d and protect the American taxpayer by ending bailouts.\n\nDid Dodd-Frank achieve what it set out to do?\n\n\u201cThis hasn\u2019t ended bailouts at all,\u201d said Paul G. Mahoney, Dean of the University of Virginia School Law School, during an event at The Heritage Foundation Tuesday.\n\nFurthermore, Mahoney added that it is \u201chard to dispute the fact that Dodd-Frank has been really, really bad for smaller banks.\u201d\n\nAlternatively, according to Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., chairman of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, \u201cDodd-Frank has actually encouraged the biggest banks to become larger and more concentrated.\u201d\n\nMichel pointed out that Dodd-Frank established the Financial Stability Oversight Council to select non-bank financial firms for increased regulatory supervision by the Federal Reserve. This very action identifies firms that the government does not want to fail, further enshrining the \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d doctrine.\n\nKevin Cirilli, a political reporter for The Hill, argued that politicians on both sides of the aisle have admitted that \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d still exists under Dodd-Frank.\n\nTwenty-sixteen presidential candidates Bernie Sanders, Hillary Clinton, Ted Cruz and Jeb Bush are all mentioning \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d on the campaign trail and proposing their respective reforms, Cirilli said.\n\n\u201cWhether you are a Democrat or a Republican, the politics of this seem to indicate that Americans are still very concerned for the potential for there being more bailouts,\u201d Cirilli explained.\n\nShelby expressed his own discontent with Dodd-Frank.\n\n\u201cI do not believe that any commercial institution, financial or otherwise, should be \u2018too big to fail,\u2019\u201d Shelby said. \u201cThe mere concept in a free market economy is repugnant and indefensible.\u201d\n\nTo address the shortcomings of Dodd-Frank after five years, the Banking Committee under Shelby\u2019s leadership released the Financial Regulatory Improvement Act of 2015 in May.\n\nThe bill aims to give financial institutions regulatory incentives to reduce systemic risk and encourage less risk to the entire financial system.\n\n\u201c\u2018Too big to fail\u2019 is far from dead,\u201d Shelby concluded during his speech. \u201cWe can, however, take meaningful steps to ensure a safer financial system and thereby reduce the probability of taxpayer bailouts in the future.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Five years after Congress passed Dodd-Frank, Americans remain concerned about the potential for big bank taxpayer bailouts.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Five years after Congress passed Dodd-Frank, Americans remain concerned about the potential for big bank taxpayer bailouts.", "title": "5 Years After Dodd-Frank, 'Too Big to Fail' Still Persists", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150721_DoddFrank.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-07-22T18:40:19+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1KkLDjg"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Five years after Congress passed Dodd-Frank, Americans remain concerned about the potential for big bank taxpayer bailouts.", "title": "5 Years After Dodd-Frank, 'Too Big to Fail' Still Persists", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150721_DoddFrank.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Economy", "tag": "monetary policy", "published_time": "2015-07-22T16:21:42+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-22T18:40:19+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Dodd-Frank, recession, financial crisis, Senator Richard Shelby, wall street reform"}, "article_summary": "Dodd-Frank was supposed to end \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d and protect the American taxpayer by ending bailouts.\nThis very action identifies firms that the government does not want to fail, further enshrining the \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d doctrine.\n\u201cI do not believe that any commercial institution, financial or otherwise, should be \u2018too big to fail,\u2019\u201d Shelby said.\nKevin Cirilli, a political reporter for The Hill, argued that politicians on both sides of the aisle have admitted that \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d still exists under Dodd-Frank.\n\u201c\u2018Too big to fail\u2019 is far from dead,\u201d Shelby concluded during his speech."}
