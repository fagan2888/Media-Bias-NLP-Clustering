Traditional Japanese food and merchandise are also for sale.\n\nThis year\u2019s festival theme is \u201cMomotaro.\u201d Momotaro means \"Peach Boy\", who was born in a peach and traveled with a dog, pheasant and monkey. Momotaro conquered demons through his travels and became a hero of Japan.\n\nThe festival will also feature the 2nd Annual Haiku Poetry Expo. In the spirit of raising awareness of the arts and culture of Japan to the people of Arizona, the committee challenges everyone to write their own Arizona-inspired Haiku and submit it to the Haiku Poetry Expo.\n\nHaiku poetry typically contains a reference to images of nature. They use simple concrete images of things we can see, smell, taste, touch, or feel. The best haiku poems reveal the essence of a thing so clearly that the reader can experience the momentary scene or insight that inspired the author.\n\nAlso at the festival, Fugetsudo, a popular confectionary shop in Little Tokyo, LA will have a booth selling mochi.\n\nAnd there will be several Rakugo performers (a form of Japanese comedy).\n\nFor more details, please call Heritage Square Office at 602.262.5071. Recorded information is available at 602.262.5029.\n\nOr visit the website: www.azmatsuri.org.\n\nCopyright 2016 KPHO/KTVK (KPHO Broadcasting Corporation).
