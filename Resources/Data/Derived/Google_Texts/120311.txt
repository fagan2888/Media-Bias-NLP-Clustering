A “Firenado” that was filmed in Colorado on March 14 is swirling its way across the Internet.

Several area fire departments were conducting a 150-acre controlled burn at the Rocky Mountain Arsenal National Wildlife Refuge when a dust devil sent dozens of flaming tumbleweeds into the sky.

Firefighter Thomas Rogers of South Metro Fire and Rescue uploaded a video to YouTube showing the burning debris.

Officials told 7News and other television stations that the the incident may have burned an additional acre but was quickly controlled.

Firefighters from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, U.S. Forest Service, South Metro, Denver, Fairmount, and West Metro Fire departments were all involved in the controlled burn.
