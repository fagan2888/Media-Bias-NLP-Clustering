According to the Associated Press, a simple majority is all that is needed to override a gubernatorial veto on matters of policy in West Virginia.\n\nOn March 4, the West Virginia House of Delegates voted 77-16 to approve the legislation.\n\nGov. Earl Ray Tomblin, D-W.Va., vetoed the legislation earlier this month on what he called \u201cconstitutional grounds.\u201d\n\nThe AP reports that the legislation bans abortion after 20 weeks, including cases involving rape or incest. Exceptions are made for cases where the life of the mother is at risk.\n\nPro-life advocates are applauding the legislation, while pro-choice advocates say that it intrudes into the relationship between a woman and her doctor.\n\n\u201cThis bill reflects the most current medical research, which clearly demonstrates that human beings feel pain beginning at least by 20 weeks gestation,\u201d West Virginians for Life President Wanda Franz said in a statement.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union of West Virginia called the legislation \u201cextreme.\u201d\n\n\u201cLaws banning abortion before viability, like House Bill 2568, are unconstitutional,\u201d the group said in a statement. \u201cThe Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in Roe v. Wade and subsequent litigation have held that a state may not ban abortion before viability, and a state may ban abortion after viability only if there are exceptions to protect the woman\u2019s health and life.\u201d\n\nMarjorie Dannenfelser, president of the Susan B. Anthony List, praised the legislation, which she called \u201cwomen-led.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe House of Delegates vote to override Gov. Tomblin\u2019s shameful veto was the first veto override since 1987,\u201d Dannenfelser said in a statement. \u201cThis historic effort is emblematic of the momentum building nationwide to protect children and women in the late stages of pregnancy. Americans are united in their opposition to brutal, barbaric abortions past the point at which the baby can feel pain.\u201d\n\nSarah Torre, a policy analyst at The Heritage Foundation, told the Daily Signal that most Americans support legislation similar to West Virginia\u2019s.\n\n\u201cThe vast majority of Americans\u2014including nearly 60 percent of women\u2014support legislation that would limit dangerous and gruesome late-term abortions after 20 weeks,\u201d said Torre.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. is currently one of only seven countries\u2014among them North Korea and China\u2014in which elective abortion after 20 weeks is allowed,\u201d she added. \u201cProtecting the health of women and the lives of unborn children who are so close to viability is a policy the American people overwhelming support and our collective conscience demands.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Lawmakers overrode governor's veto.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Lawmakers overrode governor's veto.", "title": "West Virginia Passes Law Banning Abortion After 20 Weeks", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/wvstatehouse.jpg", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1L3CJHr"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Lawmakers overrode governor's veto.", "title": "West Virginia Passes Law Banning Abortion After 20 Weeks", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/wvstatehouse.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "Protecting Life", "published_time": "2015-03-13T14:01:55+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Abortion, 20 week abortion ban, West Virginia, Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, Earl Ray Tomblin, prolife, prochoice"}, "article_summary": "On Friday, the West Virginia state Senate voted 27 to 5 to authorize House Bill 2568.\n\u201cThe U.S. is currently one of only seven countries\u2014among them North Korea and China\u2014in which elective abortion after 20 weeks is allowed,\u201d she added.\nOn March 4, the West Virginia House of Delegates voted 77-16 to approve the legislation.\nThe West Virginia legislature has passed the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, overriding the governor\u2019s veto of the legislation.\nAccording to the Associated Press, a simple majority is all that is needed to override a gubernatorial veto on matters of policy in West Virginia."}
