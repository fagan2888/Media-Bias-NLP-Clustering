Improving customer information verification \u0093adds integrity to the system, so that those really deserving of the benefits get them,\u0094 he said.\n\n\n\nGoing forward, Costantino said new software updates will improve the system\u0092s ability to verify customer information in time for the next open enrollment period Nov. 1.\n\n\n\njosh.ogorman @timesargus.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoin the conversation with the Vermont Press Bureau by following us on Facebook, Twitter and at vermontpressbureau.com.
