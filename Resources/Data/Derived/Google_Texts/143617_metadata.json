In grade school, we giggled.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nNow they\u2019re called Wife Peak, Mammary Mountain and Working Girl Creek. This didn\u2019t make sense to me, because women\u2019s roles, occupation and body parts were still being referenced.\n\nCurious, I googled it. A University of Chicago website says, \u201cOffensive toponyms fall into two categories. One type denigrates racial and ethnic groups. The other variety offends folks bothered by rude or otherwise impolite references to body parts and other no-no\u2019s.\u201d\n\nA toponym is a place name that\u2019s derived from a topographical feature. The mountain states have quite a few.\n\nAlaska still has toponyms some would find offensive. Mostly they\u2019re in far-flung, roadless areas in the bush, where most people don\u2019t go.\n\nBut the controversy around the campaign to rename Mount McKinley, the highest mountain in Alaska and North America, isn\u2019t about an offensive toponym.\n\nIt\u2019s about setting things right.\n\nThe 20,320-foot mountain long has been known as Denali (\u201dThe Great One\u201d). It was central to the Koyukon Athabascan tribe\u2019s creation story and is of significant cultural importance to Alaska\u2019s indigenous people.\n\nIn 1896, a prospector named the mountain after William McKinley, who later that year was elected the 25th U.S. president. McKinley had never been to Alaska.\n\nIn 1975, Alaska Gov. Jay Hammond initiated an effort to return the mountain\u2019s name to Denali. Recently our Alaska congressional delegation launched an aggressive campaign for the change.\n\nAlaskans weighed in and signed petitions. Denali was the overwhelming choice.\n\nSome people in Ohio, McKinley\u2019s home state, felt strongly the nation\u2019s highest mountain should keep the McKinley name.\n\nA recent TV show poked fun at Alaska\u2019s quest to rename it. In typical Lower 48 fashion, they didn\u2019t present all the facts, just talked to people in Ohio who were against the idea.\n\nThe Great One is the top thing everyone wants to see in Alaska. The first question people ask us when they visit is, \u201cWhere can I see The Mountain?\u201d\n\nI tell them you can see it from any high point in Anchorage. Have a drink at the Crow\u2019s Nest at the top of the Captain Cook Hotel, or drive up to the Glen Alps in the Chugach Mountains that cradle our fair city. You will see it.\n\nFog, haze and clouds come and go. Be patient. You will see it.\n\nSecretary of the Interior Sally Jewell Sally JewellAs climate crisis worsens, it's Interior Secretary Jewell who's being na\u00efve Puerto Rico bill drops GOP\u2019s wildlife refuge transfer Coal war intensifies with Obama review MORE announced on Sunday she had signed an order to change the name, and President Obama approved it. That was one day before he visited Alaska. Timing is everything.\n\nThe mountain knows nothing of presidents, congresses or people from Ohio. It is in Alaska and should have an Alaskan indigenous name, not one from a man who never set foot in this state.\n\nIt should be a name that speaks to us across time, demonstrating majesty. Denali: The Great One.\n\nBecause it is. Unless you see it for yourself, up close and personal, it\u2019s hard to believe that land can stretch so high to touch the sky.\n\nI worked in an office for a dozen years where I looked at it every day.\n\nI got to know its personality at different times of the year: the bright pink alpenglow of winter, the purpled sunsets in spring, the oranges of autumn.\n\nI\u2019ve flown around it. I\u2019ve landed on Ruth Glacier and gazed up at it. I\u2019ve peered at it in my rearview mirror.\n\nI wish every American could do this. Then they\u2019d understand why the name change is so important to Alaskans.\n\nAs far as toponyms go, The Land of the Midnight Sun is back in its karmic groove.\n\nAs it should be.\n\nSimenson lives in Eagle River, Alaska.
