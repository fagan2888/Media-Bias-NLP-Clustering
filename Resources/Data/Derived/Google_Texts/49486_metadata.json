She is the single most exciting Democrat currently on the national stage.\n\nHer differentness from the rest of the political profession is stark and obvious. It extends from her straightforward clarity on economic issues to the energetic way she talks. I met her several years ago when she was taking time out from her job teaching at Harvard to run the Congressional Oversight Panel, which was charged with supervising how the bank bailout money was spent. I discovered on that occasion not only that we agreed on many points of policy, but that she came originally from Oklahoma, the state immediately south of the one where I grew up, and also that high school debate had been as important for her as it had been for me.\n\nIn the years since then, Professor Warren helped to launch the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (which will probably be remembered as one of the few lasting achievements of the Obama Administration); she wrote a memoir, A Fighting Chance; and she was elected to the United States Senate from Massachusetts.\n\nThis interview was condensed and lightly edited.\n\nI want to start by talking about a line that you\u2019re famous for, from your speech at the Democratic National Convention two years ago: \u201cThe system is rigged.\u201d You said exactly what was on millions of people\u2019s minds. I wonder, now that you\u2019re in D.C. and you\u2019re in the Senate, and you have a chance to see things close up, do you still feel that way? And: Is there a way to fix the system without getting the Supreme Court to overturn Citizens United or some huge structural change like that? How can we fix it?\n\nThat\u2019s the question that lies at the heart of whether our democracy will survive. The system is rigged. And now that I\u2019ve been in Washington and seen it up close and personal, I just see new ways in which that happens. But we have to stop and back up, and you have to kind of get the right diagnosis of the problem, to see how it is that\u2014it goes well beyond campaign contributions. That\u2019s a huge part of it. But it\u2019s more than that. It\u2019s the armies of lobbyists and lawyers who are always at the table, who are always there to make sure that in every decision that gets made, their clients\u2019 tender fannies are well protected. And when that happens \u2014 not just once, not just twice, but thousands of times a week \u2014 the system just gradually tilts further and further. There is no one at the table\u2026I shouldn\u2019t say there\u2019s no one. I don\u2019t want to overstate. You don\u2019t have to go into hyperbole. But there are very few people at the decision-making table to argue for minimum-wage workers. Very few people.\n\nThey need to get a lobbyist. Why haven\u2019t they got on that yet?\n\nYeah. Why aren\u2019t they out there spending? In the context when people talk about \u201cget a lobbyist,\u201d the big financial institutions spent more than a million dollars a day for more than a year during the financial reform debates. And my understanding is, their spending has ratcheted up again. My insight about that, about exactly that point, [is] in the book [A Fighting Chance], in the second chapter, which is when my eyes first get opened to the political system. Here I am, I\u2019m studying what\u2019s happening to the American family, and just year by year by year, I\u2019m watching America\u2019s middle class get hammered. They just keep sliding further down. The data get worse every year that I keep pulling this data. Bankruptcy is the last hope to right their lives for those who have been hit by serious medical problems, job losses, a divorce, a death in the family \u2014 that accounts for about 90 percent of the people who file for bankruptcy. Those four causes, or those three if you combine divorce and death. So, how could America, how could Congress adopt a bankruptcy bill that lets credit card companies squeeze those families harder?\n\nWhat year was that?\n\nWhen they finally adopted it was 2005. But the point was, it started back in \u2014 actually it started in 1995, the effort [to change the bankruptcy laws]. And that\u2019s when I got involved with the Bankruptcy Commission. When, first, [commission chairman] Mike Synar came to me, and then Mike Synar died. It was just awful. And Brady Williamson [the replacement chairman] came to me. But what I saw during that process is, this was not an independent panel that could kind of sit and think through the [problem]: \u201cLet\u2019s take a look at what the numbers show about what\u2019s happening to the families. Let\u2019s take some testimony, get some people in here who have been through bankruptcy, and some creditors who have lost money in bankruptcy, and let\u2019s figure out some places where we could make some sensible recommendations to Congress.\u201d That wasn\u2019t what it turned out to be at all.\n\nIt turned out that it was all about paid lobbyists . . .\n\nAnd what they wanted.\n\nAnd what they wanted. I tried as hard as I could, and there were almost no bankrupt families who were ever even heard from. And you stop and think about it \u2014 why would that be so? Well, first of all, to show up to something like that, you\u2019ve got to know about it and you\u2019ve got to take a day off from work. Who\u2019s going to do that? These are families who are under enormous stress and deeply humiliated about what had happened to them. They had to make a public declaration that they were losers in the great American economic game.\n\nI know exactly the kind of people you\u2019re talking about. I wanted to ask you, not specifically about people declaring bankruptcy, but about the broader working people of this country. You\u2019re from Oklahoma. I\u2019m from Kansas. You\u2019ve seen what\u2019s happened in those places. There are lots and lots of working people in those places and a lot of other places\u2026\n\nHardworking people. People who work hard. That\u2019s what you want to remember. Not just people who kind of occasionally show up.\n\nYeah. The blue collar backbone of this country. And in places like I\u2019m describing, it gets worse every year\u2014well, I shouldn\u2019t say worse, because it\u2019s their choice, but a lot of them choose Republicans. I was looking at Oklahoma, I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re aware of this, I\u2019m pretty sure you are, 16 percent of the vote went for Eugene Debs in 1912 and today it\u2019s going in the other direction as fast as it can. How is this ever going to change?\n\nI have at least two thoughts around that and we should explore both of them. One of them is that we need to do a better job of talking about issues. And I know that sounds boring and dull as dishwater, but it\u2019s true. The differences between voting for two candidates should be really clear to every voter and it should be clear in terms of, who votes to raise the minimum wage and who doesn\u2019t. Who votes to lower the interest rate on student loans and who doesn\u2019t. Who votes to make sure women can\u2019t get fired for asking how much a guy is making for doing the same job, and who doesn\u2019t. There are these core differences that are about equality and opportunity. It can\u2019t be that we don\u2019t make a clear distinction. If we fail to make that distinction, then shame on us. That is my bottom line on this.\n\nYou know, during the Senate race that I was in \u2014 I mean, I was a first-time candidate, I\u2019d never done this before \u2014 the thing that scared me the most was that the race wouldn\u2019t be about the core differences between my opponent and me. I wanted people to understand where I stood on investments in the future, investments in education and research that help us build a future. Where I stood on the minimum wage and equal pay. And where he stood on the other side. The point was not to blur the differences and to run to some mythical middle where we agreed with each other. The point was to say that, here are really big differences between the two of us. Voters have a chance to make a choice.\n\nIn some ways that\u2019s exactly the problem. When I talk to people, they often say Democrats aren\u2019t the party of working people at all. And they talk about NAFTA and deregulating Wall Street, and they say, look at these guys, they won\u2019t prosecute the financial industry. They say, Democrats talk a good game, but they\u2019re always on the side of the elite at the end of the day. What do you say to these people?\n\nWe\u2019re the only ones fighting back. Right now, on financial reform, the Republicans are trying to roll back the financial reforms of Dodd-Frank. In fact, Mitch McConnell has announced that if he gets the majority in the Senate, his first objective is to repeal healthcare and his second is to roll back the financial reforms, and in particular to target the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau \u2014 the one agency that\u2019s out there for American families, the one that has returned more than four billion dollars to families who got cheated by big financial institutions. That\u2019s in just three years.\n\nSo, Democrats have not done all that they should, but at least we\u2019re out there fighting for the right things. We\u2019re fighting and I think trying to pull in the right direction. So if the question is, hold us to a higher standard, man, I\u2019m there. You\u2019re right. [If] you want to criticize and say, \u201cyou should do more!,\u201d the answer is: Yes, we should! You bet! We should be stronger. We should be tougher. But understand the difference between the Democratic Party and the Republican Party right now. It\u2019s pulling as hard and fast as it can in the opposite direction.\n\nNo doubt about that. I should ask you about \u2014 and we\u2019re talking about the financial crisis and the failure to prosecute anyone, and the\u2026I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m going to get the name confused, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n\nThat\u2019s okay. It was named by Republicans to be as confusing a name as possible. (laughs) I used to think of it as the four random initials. (laughs) I just call it my consumer agency. So that\u2019s it, just the consumer agency.\n\nSo here\u2019s another aspect of this: Eric Holder is stepping down as attorney general, and you in the Senate are going to have to confirm a successor. And one of the things, I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve followed this or not, but one of the things the Department of Justice has been doing, if you look at the actual prosecutions they\u2019ve been making, they essentially blame the financial crisis on little people. People who lied on their loan applications. And I wonder, are you going to demand something different out of his successor? You\u2019re going to have a chance to confirm this guy and talk to this guy\u2026\n\nYou bet I am. I want to be clear on this. It\u2019s the Justice Department. But it\u2019s also the banking regulators. And the SEC. So the most recent hearing we held that had them all in together \u2014 you know we get them in twice a year \u2014 and, boy, you want to ask me if I\u2019m glad to be in the United States Senate? (laughs) I get to be on the Banking Committee, and twice a year we haul the banking regulators in front of us for supervision. For oversight I should say, not supervision. So we had them all in. . . . We had them all in, in July. And that was the question I asked: How many big bank executives have you referred to the Department of Justice for criminal prosecution?\n\nThat\u2019s a very good question. I was going to ask you that, too.\n\nExactly right. Because that\u2019s the other half of how the game is rigged. You know, we think of it in terms of Congress, and we should, because it\u2019s definitely rigged in Congress and this is a place where people can do something about it. But the wind always blows from the same direction through the agencies. Those agencies, the banking regulators, who do they hear from, day in and day out? Big banks. They don\u2019t hear from people who got cheated on their mortgages, people who got tricked on their credit cards. They hear from the big financial institutions, day after day after day. That\u2019s, in part, what this whole Fed \u2014 this latest scandal at the Fed \u2014 you know with Carmen Segarra who has the tapes. Part of what that shows, if you just back up and think about what you\u2019re seeing there, it\u2019s that the supervisors, or regulators as they\u2019re called \u2014 everybody commonly calls them that \u2014 the regulators all meet with Goldman Sachs executives and employees day after day after day. They don\u2019t see the people who get tricked, the people who get cheated, the people who get fooled by the products that Goldman turns out.\n\nThat\u2019s right. Regulatory capture, this is an old problem. I was writing about it, obviously, in the Bush days. But President Obama had a golden opportunity when he came in to change the system and I just don\u2019t feel like it has changed, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau aside. I mean, are the regulators now referring things to the Justice Department? Are the wheels turning again?\n\nThere has not been nearly enough change. Not nearly enough. The consumer agency \u2014 this is why I argued for it \u2014 the consumer agency is structural change. So basically, the premise behind it was that there were plenty of federal laws out there, but no agency would step up and enforce them. And the responsibilities of these laws were scattered among seven different agencies and not one of those agencies saw its principal job as looking out for American families. So the OCC [Office of the Comptroller of the Currency] was all about bank profitability, the Fed was all about monetary policy. Everybody had something that they were about, but consumer protection was everybody\u2019s job and therefore nobody\u2019s job. You know, it was down seventh, or tenth or hundredth on the list and they never got to it, even as the big financial institutions were selling mortgages that should have been described as grenades with the pins pulled out. Really! My whole thing about toasters\u2014remember, that was based on fact. At the time I wrote that piece on it, that was before the crash, one in five mortgages that were being marketed by the biggest financial institutions were exploding and costing people their homes. No one would permit toasters to be sold when one in five exploded and burned down somebody\u2019s house. But they were selling mortgages like that and every regulator knew about it.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"There has not been nearly enough change,\" she tells Salon, taking on Obama failures, lobbyists, tuition.
