The 12 co-ops that went out of business operated in Arizona, Michigan, Utah, Kentucky, New York, Nevada, Louisiana, Oregon, Colorado, Tennessee, South Carolina and a co-op serving Iowa and Nebraska.\n\nThe agency\u2019s chief operating officer, Dr. Mandy Cohen, told the House Oversight and Government Reform committee that the 11 co-ops that remain are \u201cbeing monitored closely,\u201d and that eight have a corrective action plan in place and are under enhanced oversight.\n\nCohen explained that a co-op is put on a corrective action plan when the agency identifies issues with its finances, operations, compliance, or management processes.\n\nRep. Buddy Carter (R., Ga.) asked Cohen about a Department of Health and Human Services inspector general report that found that all but one of the co-ops lost money in 2014.\n\n\u201cCMS was aware of this, that almost all of the co-ops incurred losses in 2014,\u201d Carter said. \u201cIf you were aware of that and some were already shutting down why did you continue to award the taxpayer dollars in loans?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe share your concerns here,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cThese programs certainly have challenges which is why we\u2019ve been doing the extensive and aggressive oversight that we have.\u201d\n\nLawmakers asked Cohen which of the eight co-ops on corrective action plans was the most likely to fail, how many co-ops were still profitable, and how many were meeting enrollment projections.\n\nCohen told lawmakers she would follow up with specific details.\n\n\u201cHalf of them are collapsed\u2014closed\u2014your term, costing the taxpayer over a billion dollars, of the [11] that are left you can\u2019t tell me which ones you\u2019ve visited or haven\u2019t visited, what the enrollment projections are, and if they are meeting their enrollment projections\u2014whether they are profitable or not,\u201d Rep.
