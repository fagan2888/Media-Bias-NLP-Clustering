( Kenneth Jessen )\n\nA tank on wheels, drawn by a horse, once clattered down the streets of Fort Collins and its driver may have called out \"water, water\" as the water wagon passed by homes.\n\nFor a quarter, the water vendor would fill an entire barrel for drinking and cooking. A pail full of water could be purchased for a nickel.\n\nThe water wagon got its cargo directly from the Cache la Poudre River at the College Avenue. For laundry, residents used water from one of the many irrigation ditches that flowed through town.\n\nThe C.R. Welch Block was constructed of brick and stood two stories high. This dry goods store burned to the ground in February of 1880 and took with it the lives of two store clerks who lived on the second floor.\n\nIt made Fort Collins residents aware of the need for adequate fire protection. The first proposal for a waterworks came in January 1881, and the Fort Collins board of trustee voted favorably. After several false starts, civil engineer H.P. Handy was hired to design a practical system. The most economical proposal was to construct a short ditch near the head of Mercer Ditch on the Cache la Poudre River and build a structure at the corner of Bingham Hill Road and Overland Trail.\n\nVoters defeated this proposition, but in the meantime, a second disastrous fire leveled F.P. Stover's brand new drug store and an adjacent building. This gave impetus to the immediate need for the waterworks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGround was broken in October 1882 and the new waterworks building was completed the following June. Water was carried from the Cache la Poudre in an open ditch which paralleled the Mercer Ditch to the waterworks building where it was forced into the city mains by pumps powered by two water wheels. The water wheels were located below grade and fed by a penstock with a 22-foot head.\n\nNo effort was made to treat the water at this time. In 1891 and 1892, an outbreak of typhoid precipitated a new wing on the north side of the original structure to house a filtration system.\n\nThe pump is part of the original 1882-83 structure. A pair of water wheels below grade level powered a pair of pumps at ground level to increase water pressure in the system. (Kenneth Jessen)\n\nIn 1904, increased water demands for the city of Fort Collins to move the intake to the North Fork of the Cache la Poudre River. A new filtration plant was constructed, rendering the old waterworks obsolete.\n\nPublic attention was drawn to the old abandoned waterworks building by Doris and Jim Greenacre in 1986. The city of Fort Collins spent almost $90,000 in 1989 in stabilization work including reinforcing the structure, replacing broken windows, replacing the trim, restoring the door arches, patching the brick walls and putting on a new roof.\n\nWithout a doubt, the old waterworks building is one of the best-looking 19th century brick structures remaining in Larimer County. It was constructed on a natural stone foundation with brick masonry walls and a wood-framed roof. The floors are simple stone slabs in places with concrete used in other places. On the west side is an interesting 3-foot-high retaining wall that was once part of a reservoir.\n\nThe stone foundation was placed on the native dirt with no regard for its load-bearing qualities. The contractor most likely never imagined that the structure would still be standing a century later.\n\nThe building settled so badly that daylight could be seen through the cracks in the brick walls. This led to the temporary use of cables to stabilize the structure. In addition, the years took its toll on the wooden portions of the building especially the roof and the trim.\n\nThe main part of the structure has been converted into a waterworks museum. This is an interpretive history of the development of water resources and might eventually include a working water system complete with turbines, pumps and filters.\n\nThe Fort Collins Waterworks, leased to the Poudre Landmarks Foundation, is open from May through October on the second Saturday of each month from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. Its address is 2005 Overland Trail.\n\nKenneth Jessen has been a Loveland resident since 1965.
