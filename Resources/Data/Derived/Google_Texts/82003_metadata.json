It is not expected to make any policy change at its rate-setting meeting on Thursday.\n\nThe central bank is buying 80 billion euros worth of securities, mainly government bonds, every month in a bid to stimulate lending and, with it, inflation in the euro zone.\n\nHOME LOANS\n\nWhile loan supply conditions for companies eased in the first quarter of the year, banks tightened their standards for granting home mortgages and expect to continue to do so this quarter, the survey showed.\n\nA net 4 percent of the banks surveyed by the ECB reported a tightening of their internal guidelines as to who should get a loan for a house purchase.\n\nThe tightening was mainly related to the implementation in Germany of the EU mortgage credit directive, which requires banks to carry out a deeper assessment of borrowers, and to a slightly lower tolerance of risk.\n\nAmong the bloc's largest economies, banks in the Netherlands and Germany tightened conditions while their counterparts in Italy and Spain eased them.\n\nEuro area banks expect a continued net tightening of credit standards for household mortgages in the second quarter of 2016.\n\nTerms and conditions applied to home mortgages that were granted in the first quarter eased in all major economies apart from Germany, however.\n\nIn particular, banks lowered the margin they earn on loans, even though they raised the collateral required and tightened the ratio between the amount lent and the value of the property.\n\nThe rejection rate for home mortgages fell while demand from customers increased.\n\n(Reporting By Francesco Canepa; editing by John O'Donnell and Richard Balmforth)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The European Central Bank's asset-purchase program is hurting ba", "title": "Banks say ECB money printing has small impact on lending: survey", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/19/Euro-zone-banks-tighten-access-home-mortgages-ECB", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/ecb-rate_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/19/Euro-zone-banks-tighten-access-home-mortgages-ECB", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/ecb-rate_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The European Central Bank's asset-purchase program is hurting ba", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The European Central Bank's asset-purchase program is hurting bank profits while its contribution to easing lending conditions is small or diminishing, an ECB survey of lenders showed on Tuesday.\nEuro area banks expect a continued net tightening of credit standards for household mortgages in the second quarter of 2016.\nAmong the bloc's largest economies, banks in the Netherlands and Germany tightened conditions while their counterparts in Italy and Spain eased them.\nTerms and conditions applied to home mortgages that were granted in the first quarter eased in all major economies apart from Germany, however.\nThe modest result in a poll of 141 euro zone banks in March may draw more criticism of ECB President Mario Draghi, who has come under renewed fire from Germany for printing money to boost the economy."}
