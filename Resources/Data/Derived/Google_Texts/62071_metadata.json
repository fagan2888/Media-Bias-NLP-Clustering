So you cut your hair (and subsequently cry about it), or dye it; you take a short road trip; you try out your hand at feng shui (the couch looks great in that corner, by the way); etc.\n\nWell, I needed a change. It took me a while to think about what I wanted and then *pesto!* \u2014 it came to me.\n\nNormally, pesto is made with fresh basil leaves, toasted pine nuts, garlic and olive oil. But change was in the air.\n\nArugula is easily my favorite green (also called rocket) and I had tons in my fridge\u2026. like three packs. It\u2019s not a problem until you have four.\n\nPine nuts are delicious (I used them in Monday\u2019s meatless recipe), but they\u2019re also expensive. And the little voice in my head said \u201creach for the walnuts.\u201d So I did.\n\nThis pesto takes just 15 minutes to make, from start to finish, including all the prep work (and clean up). You don\u2019t need a food processor, a mini chop will work just fine.\n\nPesto is something that each chef, cook, mom, kitchen-dominator makes their own. Tweak as necessary, and don\u2019t be scared to stray away from the measurements. Use them as a guideline and make this arugula-walnut pesto yours.\n\nEnjoy summer arugula in a new way. And tell basil not to worry, he\u2019ll make an appearance soon enough.\n\nArugula-Walnut Pesto\n\nNecessities\n\n2 handfuls of fresh wild arugula (roughly chopped if using a mini chop)\n\n1/2-3/4 cup raw walnuts, toasted\n\n1-2 cloves of garlic (to taste)\n\nHalf a lemon, juiced\n\nSalt and pepper to taste\n\n2 Tbsp. grated Parmesan\n\nEVOO\n\nAssemble It\n\n1. In a mini chop or food processor, combine garlic, walnuts and arugula. Chop until well combined.\n\n2. Add salt and pepper and then slowly add EVOO while mixing until desired consistency. If you\u2019re using a mini chopper, you won\u2019t be able to stream in the EVOO. Just add a tablespoon or two at a time and then chop until desired consistency.\n\n3. Add parmesan and lemon juice and blend again.\n\n4. Taste! If it needs salt, or more nuttiness, add ingredients as necessary. Make it your own.\n\n5. Add to any and everything \u2014 especially pasta. Oh, and lick the spoon. This stuff beats brownie batter by a mile.\n\nVariations\n\nUse toasted almonds\n\nRoast your garlic for a more mellow flavor\n\nAdd red pepper flakes for some heat\n\nUse lime juice instead of lemon juice\n\nTry it out with different greens, like kale, for a boost of beneficial vitamins\n\nToss in some sun-dried tomatoes\n\nAll photos by Melissa Phy", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://sandiegofreepress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/img_6571.jpg"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce72d\"", "article_summary": "You don\u2019t need a food processor, a mini chop will work just fine.\nIn a mini chop or food processor, combine garlic, walnuts and arugula.\nThis pesto takes just 15 minutes to make, from start to finish, including all the prep work (and clean up).\nNormally, pesto is made with fresh basil leaves, toasted pine nuts, garlic and olive oil.\nIt took me a while to think about what I wanted and then *pesto!"}
