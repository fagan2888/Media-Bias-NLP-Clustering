Democrats, who have 36 votes in the Senate backing the accord, will try to add five more, which would allow them to block a Senate vote on a resolution to disapprove the deal. Democrats already have enough votes to sustain a veto of the resolution by President Obama, meaning that either way the Iran accord will go into effect.\n\nThe other fight is fiscal. Congress must come to a broad new agreement that lifts legally imposed spending caps \u2014 the preference of Mr. Obama \u2014 or, more likely, pass a short-term measure, known as a continuing resolution, to keep the lights on in government buildings for the rest of the year. Current spending laws expire on Oct. 1.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cWe will do some kind of C.R. of some duration and hopefully start the discussions,\u201d Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, said in an interview last week, referring to a continuing resolution.\n\nSome conservative Republicans, turning to a familiar playbook, are threatening to refuse to vote for any spending bill that provides federal health care money to Planned Parenthood, after a series of undercover videos surfaced this summer claiming that affiliates of the group illegally profit from selling tissue from aborted fetuses to researchers. Planned Parenthood has denied the charges.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Republicans, who would like to see money diverted from Planned Parenthood to other health clinics, are using a tactic they employed in 2013, when they refused to vote for a bill that did not include the delay of the Affordable Care Act and a repeal of a tax to pay for it \u2014 resulting in a 16-day government shutdown. Earlier this year, Republicans tried to stop executive actions by Mr. Obama on immigration by threatening the funding of the Department of Homeland Security. Both imbroglios ended in failure for Republicans because Democrats and Mr. Obama refused to go along.\n\nThe fight has been largely led this time by Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, a Republican candidate for president During the summer recess, Mr. Cruz wrote a letter to Mr. McConnell and then circulated it to his colleagues. It said in part, \u201cThe American people should no longer be forced to fund the abortion industry; therefore we will oppose any government funding legislation that would authorize or provide federal funds for Planned Parenthood.\u201d\n\nConservative Republicans have no clear exit strategy should their plan to defund Planned Parenthood pass the House but fail to get the support it needs in the Senate or from the White House, which many of them admitted was a problem last time.\n\n\u201cIn 2013 we offered no alternatives to Obamacare,\u201d said Representative Mick Mulvaney, Republican of South Carolina, who has spent the recess drumming up support for the plan. \u201cEarlier this year we offered no alternatives to the president\u2019s immigration plan. Now, we are offering a clear alternative: Move the Planned Parenthood money to other women\u2019s health clinics that simply do not provide abortion services. It\u2019s not just good policy, it\u2019s good politics as well.\u201d\n\nIt will be up to Mr. McConnell and Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio \u2014 who have repeatedly said there would not be another government shutdown \u2014 to decide if they want to go through the exercise of trying to use the spending bill to attack Planned Parenthood and go to the brink.\n\nRepublican leaders have yet to show their hand and were waiting to return to the Capitol for the all-too-familiar ritual of \u201clistening to members\u201d about how best to proceed with keeping the government open.\n\nFor the past five years, that exercise largely consisted of hundreds of the members gathering in a room to eat Mexican takeout food as one conservative after the next told his or her colleagues to ignore the reality of the math that worked against them. Drawn-out floor fights ensued, ending in Democratic victory.\n\n\u201cI am supportive of any and every viable solution to defund Planned Parenthood,\u201d said Representative Diane Black, Republican of Tennessee, who has a bill pending that would move Planned Parenthood funding to community health centers. \u201cThat said, I do not support a government shutdown.\u201d\n\nFirst Draft Newsletter Subscribe for updates on the 2016 presidential race, the White House and Congress, delivered to your inbox Monday - Friday.\n\nFor their part, Democrats are spoiling for a fight over the budget caps, imposed after a battle in 2011 over raising the government\u2019s statutory borrowing limit, known as the debt ceiling.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMany Republicans support lifting the spending caps for defense, but Democrats say they will not do that unless other domestic spending gets a lift, too. The caps are referred to as the sequester.\n\nMr. Obama has vowed to veto any spending bills that do not lift the caps on domestic spending, and Democrats have said they will block any long-term measures to fund the government without such changes.\n\n\u201cThere is significant bipartisan support for getting rid of the sequester, which the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has recently estimated would create 500,000 new jobs in 2016,\u201d said Drew Hammill, a spokesman for Representative Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California.\n\nBy the end of the year, Congress also has to find a way to fund the nation\u2019s highway system, deal with some tax measures and return to the broader spending question.\n\nFor now however, many just want the government to keep going, with as little drama as possible. \u201cI am very concerned,\u201d said Representative Charlie Dent, Republican of Pennsylvania. \u201cI don\u2019t think we need to go do a replay of 2013. It would be an enormous tactical and strategic blunder.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20150907152852, "twitter": {"description": "Lawmakers have scheduled 12 legislative days
