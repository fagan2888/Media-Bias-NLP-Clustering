That doesn\u2019t mean its historic significance should be overlooked.\n\nThe study found that Americans know perilously little about how health insurance works. Perhaps slightly more surprising (to me anyway) is the study's findings that people think they know more than they do. I actually thought everyone agreed that reading information about health insurance is like trying to read Sanskrit. I wonder if survey respondents had been shown one of those horrible \u201cExplanation of Benefits\u201d documents before taking the survey wouldn\u2019t they have been really in touch with the fact that human beings with common sense can\u2019t make heads or tails of that gobbledygook? It\u2019s all circuitous logic, alphabet soup and statements that you owe money next to vehement assertions that \u201cthis is not a bill.\" Who among us mere mortals can unravel that mess?\n\n\n\n[SEE: Political Cartoons on Obamacare]\n\nI suspect this is what people \u2013 especially younger, healthier people \u2013 think they understand: Having health insurance means I can see the doctor without touching my credit card, debit card or check book. Except for copays, of course, I get that, too. And maybe deductibles. Kind of.\n\nUnfortunately, none of that is hard and fast. In fact, under the Affordable Care Act, deductibles are rising significantly \u2013 a fact that will lead to a lot more reaching for our checkbook than many of us are used to.\n\nOverall, it really isn\u2019t surprising that Americans aren\u2019t experts on how health insurance works or on how to plan for unexpected out-of-pocket costs (the other big takeaway of the study). After all, health insurance is a product that is more often purchased for us by the government or our employer. Even when we\u2019ve had some choice in the matter, we\u2019ve made the decision the way a novice better might choose a horse \u2013 sounds fine, I like the name, hoping for the best.\n\n\n\n[READ: One More Wave of the Bloody Obamacare Shirt]\n\nEven our doctors don\u2019t seem to understand insurance half the time \u2013 they do their best to care for us, and let the paper pushers sort out the rest.\n\nSo here we are, America: About to be \u201cgiven\u201d the, um, opportunity to buy our own health insurance because our employers won\u2019t want to offer it anymore. (And P.S., if we don\u2019t have insurance we\u2019ll be in violation of the law.) It\u2019s the most expensive thing we\u2019ll ever buy next to a home or a college education, and we are starting from scratch-level knowledge. How exciting!\n\nIn all seriousness, I believe we will look back on this latest study as the end of American ignorance when it comes to health insurance. I think that learning how this gobbledygook works might just be one of the unexpected benefits of the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\n\n[READ: 5 Health Insurance Mistakes Costing You]", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Thomas Jefferson Street [Opinion]", "title": "Big Surprise: Study Shows People Don't Understand Health Care", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Health insurance is alphabet soup to most Americans, but Obamacare could change that.", "title": "Wising Up With Obamacare", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/opinion-blog/2014/10/23/big-surprise-study-shows-people-dont-understand-health-care", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/7a/d5/5eee4b544e7a8f5c7d268b5122fd/140926-moneymedicine-stock.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Health insurance is alphabet soup to most Americans, but Obamacare could change that.", "site": "@USNews", "card": "summary", "title": "Big Surprise: Study Shows People Don't Understand Health Care"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "opinion", "date_published": "Oct. 23, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Jean Card,health care,Affordable Care Act,research,health insurance,Thomas Jefferson Street [Opinion]", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Health insurance is alphabet soup to most Americans, but Obamacare could change that."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc4c3\"", "article_summary": "The study found that Americans know perilously little about how health insurance works.\nA new study on health insurance literacy from the American Institutes for Research may seem like a blinding glimpse of the obvious.\nAfter all, health insurance is a product that is more often purchased for us by the government or our employer.\nI actually thought everyone agreed that reading information about health insurance is like trying to read Sanskrit.\nIn all seriousness, I believe we will look back on this latest study as the end of American ignorance when it comes to health insurance."}
