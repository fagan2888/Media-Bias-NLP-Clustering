At the Internal Revenue Service, dozens of undercover agents chase suspected tax evaders worldwide, by posing as tax preparers or accountants or drug dealers or yacht buyers, court records show. At the Agriculture Department, more than 100 undercover agents pose as food stamp recipients at thousands of neighborhood stores to spot suspicious vendors and fraud, officials said. Undercover work, inherently invasive and sometimes dangerous, was once largely the domain of the F.B.I. and a few other law enforcement agencies at the federal level. But outside public view, changes in policies and tactics over the last decade have resulted in undercover teams run by agencies in virtually every corner of the federal government, according to officials, former agents and documents.\n\nOf course, many departments point to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, as the reason for more undercover surveillance, but many of these agents are employed to root out petty crimes like tobacco and alcohol sales to minors or to infiltrate non-criminal activity like simple political protests.\n\nThe next time you head to the Supreme Court to protest in favor of expanded gun rights or against big government legislation like Obamacare, consider this:\n\nAt the Supreme Court, all of the court\u2019s more than 150 police officers are trained in undercover tactics, according to a federal law enforcement official speaking on condition of anonymity because it involved internal security measures. At large protests over issues like abortion, small teams of undercover officers mill about \u2014 usually behind the crowd \u2014 to look for potential disturbances. The agents, often youthful looking, will typically \u201cdress down\u201d and wear backpacks to blend inconspicuously into the crowd, the official said. At one recent protest, an undercover agent \u2014 rather than a uniformed officer \u2014 went into the center of a crowd of protesters to check out a report of a suspicious bag before determining there was no threat, the official said. The use of undercover officers is seen as a more effective way of monitoring large crowds. A Supreme Court spokesman, citing a policy of not discussing security practices, declined to talk about the use of undercover officers. Mr. German, the former F.B.I. undercover agent, said he was troubled to learn that the Supreme Court routinely used undercover officers to pose as demonstrators and monitor large protests. \u201cThere is a danger to democracy,\u201d he said, \u201cin having police infiltrate protests when there isn\u2019t a reasonable basis to suspect criminality.\u201d\n\nThe guy holding the protest sign next to you might just be an undercover agent.\n\nEarlier this year, Eric Holder\u2019s Department of Justice revived a law enforcement group to investigate instances of \u201cdomestic terrorism,\u201d citing increased right-wing political activism as one of the reasons.\n\nA 2009 report \u2014 during the height of the early \u201ctea party\u201d protests \u2014 from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) revealed Big Brother (or, in this case, Janet Napolitano as Big Sister) was looking into instances of \u201crightwing extremism.\u201d Michelle Malkin was one of the first to raise the red flag.\n\nThe New York Times\u2019 latest revelations, coupled with the earlier reports from the DoJ and DHS, suggest the guy holding the protest sign next to you at the next \u201ctea party\u201d rally may not be a fellow American patriot but an undercover agent. The longterm damage to our civil liberties and the possible chilling effect these revelations could have on the freedom of speech, assembly, and association should not go unnoticed.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Big Brother,conservative activism,Department of Agriculture,Department of Homeland Security,Department of Justice,domestic spying,domestic surveillance,federal agencies,Internal Revenue", "robots": "index,follow", "description": "Next Door NeighborShocking revelations from &#8220;records and interviews&#8221; reveal at least 40 federal agencies are using undercover officers to infiltrate everyday scenarios including having them pose &#8220;as business people, welfare", "copyright": "(c) 2005-2013 United Liberty", "DC.Title": "Big Brother Alert!
