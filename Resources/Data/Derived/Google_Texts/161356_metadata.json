Cliff on Tuesday, it will mark the end of a remarkable century-long tradition in El Paso medicine.\n\nDr. Branch Craige III is a well-respected El Paso internist who has practiced in his hometown since 1980. His grandfather, Dr. Branch Craige, was a general practitioner and pediatrician from 1911 to 1946. In the early part of the last century, he helped El Paso babies recover from dehydration during the sweltering summers in a Cloudcroft sanitarium.\n\nHis son, Dr. Branch Craige Jr., practiced medicine as an El Paso internist from 1948 to 1976. He was on the cover of Life magazine for his malaria research on inmates at the Illinois State Penitentiary.\n\nDr. Craige III has applied his vocation to providing extraordinary and sensible medical care for more than 35 years to hundreds of patients, including yours truly.\n\nIt\u2019s frustrating to see the brilliant and fit-and-trim 64-year-old leave medicine. Branch says that Obamacare, electronic record keeping and insurance headaches, while irritants, are not why he\u2019s turning in his stethoscope. He and his wife Helen want to spend more time with grandchildren and in their Idaho summer home. He\u2019s already outlived his father and wants to devote more time to tennis, hiking, fishing and birding.\n\nDr. Craige is thorough, asks a lot of questions, then demonstrates his well-rounded medical acumen. His love for medicine was evidenced when he told me, \u201cIt\u2019s been a privilege to practice in El Paso \u2013 a unique opportunity given to so few.\u201d\n\nHe is retiring, ironically, because of his devotion to his patients. He says, \u201cBeing a part-time physician is irresponsible.\u201d\n\nDr. Craige\u2019s children are accomplished. Branch Craige IV, with a Ph.D. in cellular biology, is a scientist in a University of Massachusetts fellowship program. Dr. Hallie Craige McDonald is an Autin dermatologist who won\u2019t be carrying on the Craige family medical tradition in El Paso.\n\nA few years ago, my friend Vernon Castle had an unknown affliction. He lost full use of his legs, forcing him into a wheelchair. He consulted several physicians and could not get a proper diagnosis. Dr. Craige looked at his charts and while he did not diagnose the condition, he recommended a Phoenix facility that could. Barrows Institute diagnosed a rare condition, diabetic amyotrophy.\n\nA good internist treats what he can and knows when to send a patient to a specialist. My friend is back on his feet, and Dr. Craige has earned the right to move on in his life, leaving behind an unmatched El Paso medical heritage.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "El Paso Inc.", "description": "When the last patient leaves 1700 E.
