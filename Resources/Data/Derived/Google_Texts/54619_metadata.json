It said her mammogram was clean but that she has dense breast tissue, which has been linked to higher rates of breast cancer and could make her mammogram harder to read.\n\n\u201cI honestly don\u2019t know what to think about the letter,\u201d said Hoadley, 45, of Alameda. \u201cWhat do I do with that information?\u201d\n\nMillions of women such as Hoadley may be wondering the same thing. Twenty-one states, including California, have passed laws requiring health facilities to notify women when they have dense breasts. Eleven other states are considering similar laws, and a nationwide version has been introduced in Congress.\n\nThe laws have been hailed by advocates as empowering women to take charge of their own health. About 40 percent of women have dense or extremely dense breast tissue, which can obscure cancer that might otherwise be detected on a mammogram. Dense breasts have more glandular and fibrous tissue, which block the X-rays used in mammograms more than fatty tissue does.\n\nBut critics say the laws cause women unnecessary anxiety and can lead to higher costs and treatment that doesn\u2019t save lives or otherwise benefit patients.\n\n\u201cWhile I think the intent of these laws is well meaning, I think their impact is going to be a significant problem, where we end up doing more harm than good,\u201d said Dr. Laura Esserman, a UC San Francisco surgeon and breast cancer specialist.\n\nTypically, the laws require that a notice be sent to a woman if she has dense breast tissue seen on a mammogram. Some notifications suggest that a woman talk to her doctor about additional screening options.\n\nBut in some states, not including California, the laws go further by requiring health providers to offer a supplemental screening such as an ultrasound to women with dense breasts even if their mammograms are clean. Connecticut, Illinois and Indiana even require insurers to pay for an ultrasound screening after a mammography if a woman\u2019s breast density falls above a certain threshold.\n\nOtherwise insurers do not routinely cover supplemental screening for women with clean mammograms, even if they have dense breasts. The Affordable Care Act does not require it.\n\nThe problem, Esserman said, is that no medical consensus exists on whether routine supplemental screening for women with dense breasts is worthwhile.\n\nA recent Annals of Internal Medicine study using computer modeling found that offering an ultrasound to women with dense breasts after a clean mammogram would not significantly improve breast cancer survival rates but would prompt many unnecessary biopsies and raise health care costs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConnecticut study\n\nAnother study conducted in Connecticut after its notification law went into effect found that supplemental ultrasound screenings for women with dense breasts did find a few additional cancers \u2014 about three per 1,000 women screened \u2014 but the probability that such screenings would find life-threatening cancers was low.\n\nDense-breast notification laws have added another layer of complexity to the long-running and often emotional debate over how best to screen women for breast cancer.\n\nBreast cancer is the second most common form of cancer among American women, behind skin cancers, and the second leading cause of cancer death. An estimated 231,840 U.S. women will be diagnosed with invasive breast cancer this year, according to the American Cancer Society.\n\nAbout 38.5 million mammograms are performed each year in an attempt to find signs of cancer early enough to treat it successfully. Emerging technologies such as tomosynthesis, a 3-D digital X-ray of the breast, may become cheap enough to replace conventional mammography and make the notification laws irrelevant, but their widespread use is years away.\n\nFor a long time, women were advised to start yearly mammograms at about age 40. But in 2009 the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force issued controversial recommendations that most women without a family history of breast cancer or other risk factors should wait until age 50 to begin mammograms, and repeat them every two years. Patient advocates decried the recommendations as \u201crationing\u201d preventive health care for women.\n\nIn the meantime, Nancy Cappello, an education administrator from Connecticut, was pushing to pass what became the nation\u2019s first dense breast notification law.\n\nMammogram clear\n\nJust two months after a clean mammogram, she had been diagnosed with breast cancer that had spread to her lymph nodes. She had extremely dense breasts, something her radiologist knew. But Cappello was not told.\n\nEventually, she founded the patient advocacy organization Are You Dense Inc., and took her campaign national.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no evidence that we\u2019re scaring women. Most women I\u2019ve talked to are very happy to get these notifications,\u201d said Cappello, whose cancer is in remission. \u201cWe want to make informed decisions ... to have a better chance of surviving the disease.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Amy Colton, a registered nurse from Santa Cruz, was the driving force behind California\u2019s dense-breast notification law, which took effect in 2013. After learning she had advanced breast cancer that did not show up on her mammograms, Colton had entered her suggestion for the law in then-state Sen. Joe Simitian\u2019s \u201cThere Oughta Be A Law\u201d contest.\n\nToday, Colton, 53, says she can\u2019t understand why anyone would object to the law.\n\n\u201cI think that an average person, if their doctor runs a test on them, expects that the test has a reasonable degree of accuracy. But in the presence of dense breast tissue, mammography is far from accurate,\u201d Colton said. \u201cNo one is saying that these supplemental screenings after mammograms are perfect, but I just can\u2019t understand how giving more information to patients is a bad thing.\u201d\n\nSimitian, now a Santa Clara County supervisor, continues to strongly support the law he championed. He said he\u2019s been pleased to see other states follow California and Connecticut in passing their own laws.\n\n\u201cThese are the same tired arguments we confronted here in California back in 2012,\u201d when the law was debated, Simitian said. \u201cIs this relevant information that should be shared with the patient? For me the answer is a resounding yes. If we\u2019re fostering those conversations and the health care industry is now obliged to give better answers that are more carefully tailored to individual patients, that\u2019s nothing but good.\u201d\n\nNew classifications\n\nNew ways of classifying dense breast tissue could put even more women in the category of receiving dense breast notifications, said Dr. Priscilla Slanetz, who recently wrote a New England Journal of Medicine article questioning the effectiveness of dense-breast notification laws.\n\nOne reason she wrote the article, she said, was that \u201cin our state (Massachusetts) very few of our primary care providers have any knowledge about breast density and the strengths and limitations of these different tests\u201d for supplemental screening.\n\nThe same may hold true in California, where a small survey of primary care doctors found that only half of them had heard of the state\u2019s law and many felt they didn\u2019t have enough education to address what breast density meant for their patients.\n\nOn this point, both supporters and critics of the laws agree: Doctors need better tools to help their patients identify their individual cancer risks.\n\nTo that end, specialists are developing more personalized screening protocols that result in low-risk women being screened less often than higher-risk women.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not rationing; it\u2019s being rational,\u201d said Esserman, who has a $14 million grant to study the issue. \u201cWe should be testing different approaches for screening women with dense breasts, and then pass legislation once we know what to do.\u201d\n\nKaiser Health News is an editorially independent program of the Menlo Park-based Kaiser Family Foundation.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Last month, Caryn Hoadley received an unexpected letter after a routine mammogram.
