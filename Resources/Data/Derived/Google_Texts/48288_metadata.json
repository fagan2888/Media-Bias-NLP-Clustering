Space Invaders, for example, had you shooting aliens to pieces before they destroyed your base. Super Mario Bros. had you squashing poor Goombas under your feet. And Grand Theft Auto allows you to beat up just about every person you see in its virtual streets.That violence has always been linked, but never proven, to causing violent behavior. But now, a new study shows how violent video games may contribute to increased aggression and a decreased sensitivity to it.\n\nOn Thursday, the American Psychological Association (APA) announced the release of a 49-page report from its Task Force on Violent Media, which was founded in 2013 to look at the scientific literature published between 2005 and 2013 that investigated the effects of violent video games. The report found that although violent video games may increase aggression and desensitize people to it, there is insufficient evidence to determine whether violent games also lead to criminal violence or delinquency.\n\n\"The research demonstrates a consistent relation between violent video game use and increases in aggressive behavior, aggressive cognitions, and aggressive affect, and decreases in prosocial behavior, empathy, and sensitivity to aggression,\" the report concluded. It goes on to state that \u201cno single risk factor consistently leads a person to act aggressively or violently. Rather, it is the accumulation of risk factors that tends to lead to aggressive or violent behavior.\u201d\n\nAs a result, the APA will adopt new policies and recommendations \u2014 first by replacing its 2005 study, \"Resolution on Violence in Video Games and Interactive Media.\" The new document will be called, \u201cResolution on Violent Video Games.\u201d In it, the APA will encourage the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) to refine its video game rating system \u201cto reflect the levels and characteristics of violence in games, in addition to the current global ratings.\u201d\n\nDespite these actions, researchers said the study results weren\u2019t conclusive and that further research will be necessary. This research would differentiate between males and females who play games, the effects of violent video games on children under 10, and the effects of a game\u2019s violence over the course of a child\u2019s development.\n\nThere will most likely always be violence in video games, as they continue to be popular. Grand Theft Auto V has sold more than 54 million copies since 2013, Space Invaders found its way into the Pixels movie, and Super Mario Bros.\u2019 protagonist, Mario, is a global icon. While there may be no stopping the proliferation of these games, reviews like the APA\u2019s will help people better understand violence in games and who should be playing them.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "violent video games aggression american psychological association", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Violent video games may be a factor in increased aggression and a decrease in sensitivity to aggression, a new report shows.", "title": "Violence In Video Games Linked To Aggression, But Not Criminal Behavior", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/violence-video-games-linked-aggression-not-criminal-behavior-347916", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/08/14/violent-video-games.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Violent video games may be a factor in increased aggression and a decrease in sensitivity to aggression, a new report shows.", "title": "Violence In Video Games Linked To Aggression, But Not Criminal Behavior", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/violence-video-games-linked-aggression-not-criminal-behavior-347916", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/08/14/violent-video-games.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/08/14/violent-video-games.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-08-14T14:14:42-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-14T14:14:41-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Violent video games may be a factor in increased aggression and a decrease in sensitivity to aggression, a new report shows."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbc24\"", "article_summary": "Violence in video games may be a factor in increased aggression and a decrease in sensitivity to aggression, according to a new report.\nThe report found that although violent video games may increase aggression and desensitize people to it, there is insufficient evidence to determine whether violent games also lead to criminal violence or delinquency.\nBut now, a new study shows how violent video games may contribute to increased aggression and a decreased sensitivity to it.\nThis research would differentiate between males and females who play games, the effects of violent video games on children under 10, and the effects of a game\u2019s violence over the course of a child\u2019s development.\nThere will most likely always be violence in video games, as they continue to be popular."}
