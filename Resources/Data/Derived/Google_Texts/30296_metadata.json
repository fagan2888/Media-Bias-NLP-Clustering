I don\u2019t want a wave that drowns us.\u201d I pointed out to him that it was also was possible that the bigger the Trump profile, the worse it might be for the GOP \u201cdown ballot\u201d candidates. That is what a lot of party pros think as they prepare to help everyone BUT Trump. \u201cWell, I\u2019m a numbers guy,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m going with my theory. I might consider voting for a Democrat but I can\u2019t stand Hillary.\u201d\n\nJamie Rhodes/USA Today Sports via Reuters\n\nI asked him why. He hesitated. I think I knew what he wanted to say: that he considered Hillary Clinton to be a screechy, hectoring female, like the early wives of the rich guys visiting Louisville who\u2019d finally found a good woman -- agreeable, quiet -- in Palm Beach. He didn\u2019t say that, though. Women were in line, and just because they wore weird big hats didn\u2019t mean that they couldn\u2019t be offended by a loud guy from New York. Finally he answered. \u201cI guess I don\u2019t like her because I KNOW she will raise my taxes,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure Trump will. So, yes, that\u2019s it.\u201d\n\nI figure I have to be for Trump. I don\u2019t want a wave that drowns us.\n\nI spent a happy four days last week in Louisville, where I began my reporting career years ago and where I maintain close ties that get me invited back for Derby. I was the guest of U.S. Rep. John Yarmuth (D) of Louisville, a friend of 40 years who, in our early days, was a Republican and friend of a fellow young Republican named Mitch McConnell. I spoke to a score of prominent GOP people in office, in corporate positions, in the role of donors or captains of industry. Few would talk on the record, but the bottom line was clear. Most (not all) were wary or ashamed of Donald Trump's rise. But their objections weren\u2019t moral -- and did not include the list that we at The Huffington Post run as a disclaimer at the bottom of each and every Trump story we write. With these people it is all transactional: Trump was an unpleasant problem to work around or endure, not something to publicly denounce or publicly renounce the way the Bush Family had done. \u201cThat was classless,\u201d one GOP insider told me. Trump was the crazy uncle in the basement of racism and fear that is the foundation of the modern GOP. Party leaders here know they have to expand that vision, but they don\u2019t quite know how or perhaps have the will to do so. In the meantime, Trump barged in with a naked version of the old appeal and he won most of the voters. \u201cWe have to change,\u201d said one GOP leader. \u201cWe all know that what the party said in that report after 2012 is correct -- that we have to do more to modernize and grow our reach.\" \u201cBut those pesky voters said otherwise,\u201d he said, not sounding entirely upset. \u201cThe Republican Party has survived Herbert Hoover and Barry Goldwater,\u201d this person told me. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll survive Trump.\u201d That most people I spoke with did not want to be named is itself a sign of how Republicans are cautiously trying to survive Trump.\n\nTed S. Warren/ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nThe mogul was not utterly without his forthright supporters on Millionaires Row. One of them was Rep. Billy Long (R-Mo.), a bull-necked, affable fellow who had a giant unlit cigar jutting up out of his shirt pocket as we talked. Long, a conservative from the most conservative part of Missouri (the southwest), was a radio talk show host and is well known as a top Las Vegas level poker player. As a candidate, Long had been advised by Jeff Roe, who had gone on to run Sen. Ted Cruz\u2019s (R-Texas) campaign for the nomination this year. Despite that tie, Long told me that Republicans were fools if they did not back Trump to the hilt. \u201cHe kicked everybody\u2019s butt, won far more votes, and we can WIN with him,\u201d he said. \u201cVoters are fed up with Washington, with politics as usual. If we can get all the men up off the couch and get them to actually vote we can win.\u201d\n\nHe kicked everybody\u2019s butt, won far more votes, and we can WIN with him. If we can get all the men up off the couch and get them to actually vote, we can win. Rep. Billy Long (R-Mo.)\n\nBut both in on-the-record volubility and ground-level optimism, Long was the exception at the tables of the Row. \u201cWe need to do what we were going to do anyway,\u201d said an elected official, \u201cwhich is to concentrate on the House and the Senate. Obama helped us a lot in 2010 because of Obamacare and we got the kind of redistricting we needed so that we can hold the House even with Trump on the ticket. \u201cOn the Senate side, they\u2019ll do what they were going to do anyway, which is to focus on the six or seven swing seats and put all of the money and effort was can into those.\u201d A businessman who knows Paul Ryan well said that he expected the speaker eventually to endorse Trump, after he and Kentucky\u2019s Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, played good cop/bad cop with the Donald on things. \u201cMitch is totally pragmatic,\u201d said one of his admirers on the Row. \u201cHe\u2019ll go about his business. If Trump winds up president, Mitch will be able to deal with him.\u201d McConnell himself has said that, indeed, he would support Trump. What form that takes remains to be seen.
