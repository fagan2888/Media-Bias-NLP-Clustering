Yet, as we\u2019re frequently made aware of these tragic news stories, be it through TV or social media, we\u2019re less aware of the effects constant consumption has on our mental health. A new study from the Netherlands may help to bridge this gap.\n\nResearchers were actually in the middle of a study on the prenatal and postnatal mental health of women in the Netherlands when they noticed women were \u201cmeasurably more depressed\u201d following the Malaysia Airlines MH17 crash, Live Science reported. At this point, women began to list tragedy as a \u201cmajor life event\u201d they had experienced during their pregnancy. Victor Pop, study author and researcher at the University of Tilburg, said this became \u201ca side note of the project.\"\n\n\"We realized that possibly we could have very interesting data in our hands, because we had women who had completed the [same] questionnaires in 2013,\" Pop told Live Science.\n\nThese questionnaires required women to measure their levels of depression on a scale of one to 10, with 10 being the most depressed. When comparing the two groups\u2019 answers, Pop and his team found an increase in depression among women involved in the study in 2014, the year the plane crash took place. These women had an average score of 5.21 on the depression scale compared to an average score of 4.11 among the women who filled out the questionnaire in 2013.\n\nThe spike in depression, however, was temporary. Researchers found by one week postpartum, women who\u2019d been pregnant during the plane crash were no more depressed than women who\u2019d given birth the year before. Live Science added \u201cthere were very few women with full-blown depression in either group.\u201d\n\nFor now, Pop can\u2019t say for sure if \u201cpregnant women are more or less vulnerable to the emotional effects of a national tragedy,\u201d but he does cite similar studies done on 9/11, in which Americans were found to have \u201ca similar temporary spike in mental health problems.\u201d\n\nIt stands to reason then a constant flash of tragic news and headlines will no doubt have an impact on our emotions. Dr. Mary McNaughton-Cassill, an associate psychology professor at the University of Texas-San Antonio, has previously said we live in a time now where we\u2019re surrounded with more media and more information than at any other point throughout history.\n\nPsychology Today cited separate research that found people who watched negative news bulletins would spend more time thinking and talking about what worries them and were more likely to catastrophise their worry compared to people not watching as much news. These findings demonstrate how both news makes viewers and readers more sad and anxious, but it also \"exacerbates their own personal worries and anxieties.\"\n\nThese effects are relevent no matter which country a plane crash or terrorist attack occurs in \u2014 they're universally perceived as threatening situations. And when our brain registers that kind of situation, the body starts to produce stress hormones. After all, it's what they're hardwired to do.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "national, news, and, mental, health, tragic, stories, may, negatively, impact, pregnant, women", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Researchers in the Netherlands have accidentally stumbled upon some interesting data on women's depression levels following a national tragedy.", "title": "The Toll Tragic News Stories Takes On Your Mental Health", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/national-news-and-mental-health-tragic-stories-may-negatively-impact-pregnant-women-344584", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/07/24/ukraine.JPG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Researchers in the Netherlands have accidentally stumbled upon some interesting data on women's depression levels following a national tragedy.", "title": "The Toll Tragic News Stories Takes On Your Mental Health", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/national-news-and-mental-health-tragic-stories-may-negatively-impact-pregnant-women-344584", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/07/24/ukraine.JPG", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/07/24/ukraine.JPG"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Under the Hood", "published_time": "2015-07-24T15:14:23-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-25T14:20:22-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Researchers in the Netherlands have accidentally stumbled upon some interesting data on women's depression levels following a national tragedy."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb212\"", "article_summary": "Researchers found by one week postpartum, women who\u2019d been pregnant during the plane crash were no more depressed than women who\u2019d given birth the year before.\nVictor Pop, study author and researcher at the University of Tilburg, said this became \u201ca side note of the project.\"\nYet, as we\u2019re frequently made aware of these tragic news stories, be it through TV or social media, we\u2019re less aware of the effects constant consumption has on our mental health.\nThese effects are relevent no matter which country a plane crash or terrorist attack occurs in \u2014 they're universally perceived as threatening situations.\nAt this point, women began to list tragedy as a \u201cmajor life event\u201d they had experienced during their pregnancy."}
