The Tommy Oliver Stadium was filled with Junior ROTC cadets from Bay County, Rutherford, Arnold and Mosley High Schools Saturday.

They came out for the annual Bay County drill meet where Junior ROTC cadets set out for a national achievement.

The goal was to set the Guinness Book of World Records for the most Junior ROTC adets running a 5K at the same time.

Junior cadets from all over the world began running at the same time, regardless of where they were.

Local students were happy to partake in the effort.

"They love it," said Bill Doyle, Junior ROTC Instructor at Rutherford High School. "You can see smiles whether they are from Mosley, Arnold, Rutherford or Bay. There is just smiles. Of course there is a lot of sweat from doing this, it is very humid for today's run but its been great."

In order to beat the world record, 150,000 cadets needed to be running at the same time, those results will be published within the next few weeks.
