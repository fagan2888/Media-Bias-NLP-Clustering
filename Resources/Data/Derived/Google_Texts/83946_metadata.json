James Bowman of the American Spectator:\n\n\u201cIf ever in slavery\u2019s 250-year history in North America there were a kind master or a contented slave, as in the nature of things there must have been, here and there, we may be sure that Mr McQueen does not want us to hear about it.\u201d\n\nBreitbart\u2019s Christian Toto:\n\nIs \u201912 Years A Slave\u2019s\u2019 Oscar Campaign Playing White Guilt Card To Sway Voters?\n\nToto\u2019s warning proved prescient, as guilty liberals succumbed to affirmative action and handed out Oscars to the film over more deserving white candidates. Debbie Schlussel:\n\n\u201cUp front, there was the slavery from over a century ago (\u201cTwelve Years a Slave\u201d\u2013read my review) and the never-ending cries of racism that justify Obamaphones, Obamacare, welfare, minority set-asides, affirmative action, and every other form of reparations now plaguing America. Race merchantry lives on at Oscar.\u201d\n\nBut all these forms of liberal bias \u2014 myopic focus on the bad parts of slavery without any corresponding attention to the good parts, white guilt, and race merchantry \u2013 have a long pedigree. Long enough, indeed, to date back to the era of slavery itself.\n\nObviously, liberal Hollywood did not exist in the 19th century. But the liberal New York Times did. And the liberal agenda was shameless enough to beat its liberal audience over the head with the evils of slavery even though the institution was a mere dozen years away from being abolished altogether. A (subscriber-only) New York Times account from January 20, 1853 provides the kind of breathless, one-sided coverage of 12 Years that has become depressingly familiar today.\n\nThe Times\u2019s account selectively frames the story to highlight the plight of Northrup, not hard-pressed job creators like Edwin Epps. Then in the middle of the account, it plunks this outrageous bit of editorializing:\n\nIt is all but justice to say that the authorities of Avoyelles, and indeed at New Orleans, rendered all the assistance in their power to secure the establishment of the freedom of this unfortunate man, who had been snatched so villainously from the land of freedom, and compelled to undergo sufferings almost inconceivable in this land of heathenism, where slavery exists with features more revolting than those described in \u201cUncle Tom\u2019s Cabin.\u201d \u2026 He was sometimes compelled to perform acts revolting to humanity, and outrageous in the highest degree.\n\nTalk about race merchantry! The North, lectures the Grey Lady, is \u201cthe land of freedom,\u201d and the South a \u201cland of heathenism.\u201d Yes, the New York Times has been sneering at red-state America for 160 years.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#000", "description": "Breitbart was right about you, New York Times.", "generator": "the-factory", "og": {"site_name": "Daily Intelligencer", "description": "Breitbart was right about you, New York Times.", "title": "Here\u2019s How the Biased Liberal New York Times Covered 12 Years a Slave in 1853", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2014/03/biased-12-years-in-1853.html", "image": "http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2014/01/16/oscars-ballot/best-picture-12-years-a-slave.w1200.h630.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Breitbart was right about you, New York Times.", "creator": "@jonathanchait", "image": "http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2014/01/16/oscars-ballot/best-picture-12-years-a-slave.w750.h560.2x.jpg", "title": "Biased Times Favored 12 Years in 1853", "site": "@intelligencer", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Daily Intelligencer", "fb": {"app_id": 120608177953522}, "msapplication-TileImage": "//cache.nymag.com/media/di/icon.144x144.png", "application-name": "Daily Intelligencer", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "keywords": "the national interest, politics, 12 years a slave", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/NewYorkMag", "tag": "the national interest,politics,12 years a slave", "published_time": "2014-03-03T17:22:00.000Z", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/JonathanChaitPublic"}, "topics": "topics-test, the national interest, politics, 12 years a slave", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd00be\"", "article_summary": "A (subscriber-only) New York Times account from January 20, 1853 provides the kind of breathless, one-sided coverage of 12 Years that has become depressingly familiar today.\nBut the liberal New York Times did.\nTalk about race merchantry!\nThe North, lectures the Grey Lady, is \u201cthe land of freedom,\u201d and the South a \u201cland of heathenism.\u201d Yes, the New York Times has been sneering at red-state America for 160 years.\nThe Times\u2019s account selectively frames the story to highlight the plight of Northrup, not hard-pressed job creators like Edwin Epps."}
