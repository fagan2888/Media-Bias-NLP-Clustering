Mark Thoma — still the one place you should go every day if you want to keep in touch with the ongoing economics discussion — links to Martin Feldstein’s latest on macroeconomic policy, and editorializes with one word: “Wow”.

I’m wowed too.

Feldstein is a permahawk; he has been warning that the Fed’s policies are dangerously inflationary since early 2009. In his latest, however, inflation has vanished from the argument — yet he still insists that quantitative easing is bad, bad, bad. And to replace it he suggests an elaborate system of cyclically varying taxes, with tax breaks for investment when the economy is depressed that will be withdrawn when it recovers.

It’s a remarkable scheme for a conservative, of all people, to propose; it involves the government trying to muck around with private incentives on a regular basis, with lots of intrusive behavior — we’ll reward some kinds of spending, but not others — and obvious opportunities for gaming the system that would promote a lot of employment among tax lawyers. Also, one of Feldstein’s long-standing arguments about what’s wrong with quantitative easing is that we can’t trust the Fed to withdraw it when it’s no longer needed. Um, and we can count on Congress to withdraw tax breaks for corporations promptly when the macroeconomic justification has ended? The mind reels.

The really remarkable thing, however, is that the animus against QE remains even though the alleged reason for that animus has evaporated. True, Feldstein makes some vague claims about distorted incentives and reaching for yield; it always amazes me how ready conservatives are to assert that investors and markets are irrational when it serves their agenda. But basically at this point the case against QE is levitating in thin air; it was built on a foundation of inflation fears, but is still hovering there now that those fears have been sent down the memory hole.

It’s a very peculiar thing.
