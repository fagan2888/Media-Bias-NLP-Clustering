The average premium cost for Affordable Care Act plans available on Healthcare.gov is now $408 per month before advance premium tax credits (APTC) are applied, and $113 after they're applied, according to a new report from the Department of Health and Human Services. HHS has previously said the average premium for a benchmark ACA silver plan will rise 7.5 percent this year.

Eighty-three percent of plans on the federal exchange have APTC, the report notes, and this year 7 out of 10 consumers had the option of selecting a plan with a monthly premium of $100 or less after applying the APTC. As of Dec. 26, 48 percent of consumers had selected a plan with APTC, and the average value of an APTC was $294 per person.

In addition, consistent with the government's message that shopping around can save consumers money, the report found that re-enrollees who changed plans saved an average of $43 per month after APTC was applied. Report
