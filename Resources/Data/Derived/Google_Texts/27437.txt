Republican Donald Trump is the presidential candidate who would be most agreeable for the insurance industry, according to a survey of insurance professionals conducted by A.M. Best.

“On the political front, insurers appear very aware of the ramifications of the 2016 presidential election. Here, the landscape for the insurance industry could look very different, depending on which candidate becomes president,” the Oldwick, N.J.-based ratings agency wrote in its “A.M. Best Winter 2015/2016 Insurance Industry Survey,” which was published late last week.
