CMSP includes virtually all the counties north of the Bay Area and Sacramento to the Oregon border and many in the Sierra Nevada mountains bordering Nevada and in the Central Valley.\n\nThis month CMSP, which provides the required indigent care for California\u2019s 35 smaller and most rural counties, is expanding eligibility in its main program, including raising the income level from 200% to 300% of the federal poverty level ($60,480 for a family of three). CMSP is also offering a new limited primary care benefit of three doctor visits and up to $1,500 in pharmacy coverage to those in its program, as well as to other residents (138-300% of poverty level) regardless of immigration status. The expansion\u2019s implementation has been ongoing through this month, with the final computer systems being switched on to enroll patients starting today. Potentially thousands of uninsured Californians will benefit from this expansion, as well as those in other counties that have launched similar pilot programs in the last year.\n\n\u201cOur rural communities and our health system are stronger if more Californians have access to primary and preventive care and have the financial security of coverage. This month\u2019s expansion in 35 rural counties of primary and preventive care is another step forward to a healthier California,\u201d said Anthony Wright, executive director of Health Access California, the statewide health care consumer advocacy coalition. \u201cThese improvements in rural counties are aligned with changes in state policy and in other counties around the state, toward a more inclusive and smarter safety net. Thousands of Californians will benefit from these new pilot programs, but there\u2019s more work to do in many counties and statewide to further expand and strengthen our health system on which we all rely.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe ACA in California has brought major improvements in health coverage for many Californians, yet there continue to be those who are uninsured. The CMSP Governing Board\u2019s expansion of CMSP eligibility and creation of the CMSP Primary Care Benefit are intended to reach more of the remaining uninsured in the 35 CMSP counties,\u201d said Lee Kemper, Policy & Planning Consultant, CMSP Governing Board.\n\nLast week, Health Access released a new report detailing the dramatic changes to California\u2019s health care safety net programs at the county level. As the Affordable Care Act implementation has cut the number of uninsured Californians in half and the state has taken additional steps to cover all children, many California counties have extended their health care safety net programs to better serve the remaining uninsured. Counties have responded in various ways, from expanding coverage options to undocumented immigrants to providing new benefits to those already covered. A year ago, less than ten counties served undocumented Californians outside of the emergency room; today, that number expands to 47 counties.\n\nHealth Access\u2019 new report, \u201cProfiles of Progress: California Counties Taking Steps to a More Inclusive and Smarter Safety-Net,\u201d examines the expansion in the County Medical Services Program (CMSP) along with an in-depth analyses of how six other counties adjusted their safety net programs in response to changes in need and funding. These counties include: Contra Costa, Los Angeles, Monterey, Sacramento, Santa Clara, and Fresno.\n\nThe report predicts that additional California counties will also launch similar efforts in the near future, especially under new financial structures under both state law and the new federal Medicaid waiver and its Global Payment Program, which has incentives to offer preventive care and other treatments prior to the need for emergency or episodic care. In turn, these actions at the county level also provide additional momentum at the state level for inclusive health policies, such as the recent expansion last week of Medi-Cal to cover all eligible children, regardless of immigrant status.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Today, All 35 Rural Counties in the CMSP Will Have Expanded Eligibility for Indigent Care, Including Raising Income Level to 300% FPL ($60K)", "og": {"site_name": "State of Reform", "description": "SACRAMENTO, Calif., \u2014 Today, more uninsured Californians in 35 of the state\u2019s most rural counties will be able to benefit from a new \u2026", "title": "Expanded eligibility and benefits for uninsured Californians in 35 rural counties begins", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://stateofreform.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/stor-thumb-health-access.jpg", "url": "http://stateofreform.com/issues/access-issues/2016/05/31057/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Today, All 35 Rural Counties in the CMSP Will Have Expanded Eligibility for Indigent Care, Including Raising Income Level to 300% FPL ($60K)", "creator": "@StateofReform", "image": "http://stateofreform.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/stor-thumb-health-access.jpg", "title": "Expanded eligibility and benefits for uninsured Californians in 35 rural counties begins - State of Reform", "site": "@StateofReform", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 17821687}, "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/stateofreform/", "section": "Access", "published_time": "2016-05-23T10:20:32+00:00"}, "OBKey": "12RjP7ip2KRyl5dliGRkEQ==", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Potentially thousands of uninsured Californians will benefit from this expansion, as well as those in other counties that have launched similar pilot programs in the last year.\nA year ago, less than ten counties served undocumented Californians outside of the emergency room; today, that number expands to 47 counties.\nLast week, Health Access released a new report detailing the dramatic changes to California\u2019s health care safety net programs at the county level.\nThe CMSP Governing Board\u2019s expansion of CMSP eligibility and creation of the CMSP Primary Care Benefit are intended to reach more of the remaining uninsured in the 35 CMSP counties,\u201d said Lee Kemper, Policy & Planning Consultant, CMSP Governing Board.\nCounties have responded in various ways, from expanding coverage options to undocumented immigrants to providing new benefits to those already covered."}
