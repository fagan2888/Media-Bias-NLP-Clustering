Hey, how ’bout that?

How the GOP became the white supremacy party — and got away with it http://t.co/ldjwegu8bd — Salon.com (@Salon) March 21, 2014

In “How the GOP became the white supremacy party — and got away with it,” writer Chauncey DeVega goes full smear-job on Paul Ryan and the other “racial political arsonists” in the GOP. A few gems from the Salon piece:

Paul Ryan is the leader of a political party that is the country’s premier white identity organization. * * * Paul Ryan traffics in racism because the Republican Party is a racist organization. * * * Instead of trying to figure out “if” Paul Ryan is a racist, the more revealing question is “what type of racist is he?”

Townhall editor Katie Pavlich and others noted a name that was mysteriously absent from the tiresome tirade: Robert Byrd.

Amazing how @Salon dubs the GOP as "white supremacist party," forgetting KKK member Sen. Robert Byrd, who Clinton defended, was a Democrat — Katie Pavlich (@KatiePavlich) March 21, 2014

According to @Salon, Paul Ryan is a white supremacist, but for some weird reason don't mention *actual* white supremacist & Dem Robert Byrd — Katie Pavlich (@KatiePavlich) March 21, 2014

Perfect example: Robert Byrd. Oh…Wait… MT @Salon: How the GOP became the white supremacy party — and got away with it — Amy Lutz (@amylutz4) March 21, 2014

@chaunceydevega You spelled Robert Byrd wrong in this article. http://t.co/LKc6XWzIeb — Will (@Will32283) March 21, 2014

Also a Democrat who literally tried to block desegregation of schools “@AllianceCMattox: @KatiePavlich @Salon don't forget Gov Wallace.” — Katie Pavlich (@KatiePavlich) March 21, 2014

Those meddling Republicans RT @BecketAdams: @amylutz4 I like their Scooby Doo headline. @Salon — Amy Lutz (@amylutz4) March 21, 2014

@KatiePavlich @Salon didn't mention racist Dem Al Gore Sr.+ Sen. Fulbright, Bill Clinton's idol, both voted against Civil Rights Act. — Crystal Wright (@GOPBlackChick) March 21, 2014
