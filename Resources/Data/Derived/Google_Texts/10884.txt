Aramis Ramirez had four hits and three RBIs, Pedro Alvarez homered and Pittsburgh roughed up the sloppy Mets after a rain delay Sunday for an 8-1 victory that sealed the Pirates' first season series sweep of New York.



Alvarez, Ramirez and Gregory Polanco each had run-scoring hits in a four-run seventh, putting this game out of reach after the teams played extra innings the previous two nights.



Pittsburgh also scored on a passed ball by Travis d'Arnaud in their sixth straight win over a potential postseason foe. The Pirates swept the Mets in a three-game set at home in May.



Alvarez and d'Arnaud each homered in the second inning off starters Matt Harvey and Jeff Locke, who matched each other in a gritty duel until a sudden sun shower turned to a heavy storm in the bottom of the sixth.



Bobby Parnell (1-3), who got the defeat in the opener of the series Friday, was booed as he yielded four runs.



Arquimedes Caminero (4-1) was the winner.
