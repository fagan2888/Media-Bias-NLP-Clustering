He fell onto the east side of the six-foot wall after bullets peppered his back and stomach.\n\nWith the young bricklayer was Helmut K., an 18-year-old coworker who managed to evade a shower of roughly 35 bullets before climbing over the Berlin Wall.\n\nHelmut K. made it to safety as Fetcher lay screaming in pain for nearly an hour before his cries for help ceased. East German guards eventually carried him to a hospital, where he was declared dead.\n\nThough the two teens had previously discussed a desire to escape to West Germany, they had not planned a crossing for that August day. In fact, they were merely exploring an abandoned carpentry workshop building during their lunch break when they heard voices, became frightened and went out a window, and found themselves at the border.\n\n\u201cI had reached the Wall by then, jumped up and forced myself through the barbed wire on the top of the Wall. I don\u2019t know why Peter didn\u2019t climb up,\u201d Helmut K. said. \u201cHe should have been at the Wall before me. He didn\u2019t say anything and I had the feeling when the shots were fired that Peter Fechter was in a state of shock. I called out loudly to him: \u2018Come on, come on, hurry up!\u2019 But he didn\u2019t move.\u201d\n\nThe tragedy was witnessed by horrified onlookers on both sides of the border. West German guards tried to help by tossing bandages over the wall, but they could not cross over due to safety concerns.\n\nAmerican soldiers at the nearby Checkpoint Charlie were not able to risk helping Fechter, either.\n\nIt was reported that shouts of \u201cmurderers\u201d and \u201cbandits\u201d erupted from the several thousand people that had gathered, aimed at the three East German guards who had fired the shots. Communist police threw tear gas grenades to break up the crowd; Fechter had to suffer the intake of the tear gas as he bled to death.\n\nSeveral years later, in 1990, one of Fechter\u2019s two older sisters pressed charges against the East Berlin guards. In 1997, two of the guards who killed Fechter were convicted of murder and were said to have apologized.\n\nA memorial plaque is now located at the Fechter home, in addition to a monument at the site of Fechter\u2019s death, a sculpture along the so-called former \u2018Death Strip,\u2019 and a cross at the former site of the Checkpoint Charlie crossing point.\n\nIn August 2014, around 300 ultramarathon runners traced the 100-mile-long path of the Berlin Wall to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the destruction of the Berlin Wall. Today, the path is a hiking and cycling trail that takes ultramarathon runners 16 to 30 hours to complete.\n\nRunners receive a medal embossed with an image of Fechter once they cross the finish line.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In 1962, Peter Fechter was just 18 when he was shot down by East German border guards.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "In 1962, Peter Fechter was just 18 when he was shot down by East German border guards.", "title": "Today Marks 53rd Anniversary of Teen Killed at Berlin Wall", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/Peter-Fechter.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-08-17T23:57:03+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1Jc42IT"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "In 1962, Peter Fechter was just 18 when he was shot down by East German border guards.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/Peter-Fechter.jpg"}, "title": "Today Marks 53rd Anniversary of Teen Killed at Berlin Wall", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "International", "tag": "europe", "published_time": "2015-08-17T11:43:18+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-17T23:57:03+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "peter fechter, berlin wall, east berlin, germany, cold war"}, "article_summary": "In August 2014, around 300 ultramarathon runners traced the 100-mile-long path of the Berlin Wall to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the destruction of the Berlin Wall.\nSeveral years later, in 1990, one of Fechter\u2019s two older sisters pressed charges against the East Berlin guards.\nFifty-three years ago today, the eyes of the world turned to East Germany as an 18-year-old\u2019s suffering became an international symbol of cruelty.\nEast German guards eventually carried him to a hospital, where he was declared dead.\nWest German guards tried to help by tossing bandages over the wall, but they could not cross over due to safety concerns."}
