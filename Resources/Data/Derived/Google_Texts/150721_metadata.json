Bob Casey (D-Pa.), along with Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), proposed an amendment to enact two types of tax breaks for the middle class on Thursday.\n\nWASHINGTON -- Democrats will dare Republicans to vote against an expansion of tax credits for the middle class with an amendment that's intended to help married couples and people burdened by the high cost of child care.\n\nSens. Bob Casey (D-Pa.) and Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.) are the lead co-sponsors for the amendment, first shared with The Huffington Post and introduced on Thursday. Senators will consider the measure alongside a broader spending bill Republicans are using to repeal much of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe Democrats' amendment is almost guaranteed to face GOP opposition, so it's largely a symbolic move. That's fitting, since the Senate's Republican leadership has already admitted that the entire exercise of passing a bill to repeal President Barack Obama\u2019s signature legislative achievement is itself symbolic.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) said Tuesday that he expects Democrats to offer a \u201cvery small\u201d number of amendments, so this amendment is one of the few that will get consideration. Congress must pass a spending bill by Dec. 11 to avoid a government shutdown.\n\n\u201cIf we enact these policies we will guarantee that these middle class families see their incomes go up, and we can do it in a fiscally responsible way that pays for these tax cuts by closing the most egregious tax loopholes,\u201d Casey said in a statement. \u201cRepublicans, on the other hand, propose a number of steps that will make it harder for families to make ends meet, like gutting the ACA.\u201d\n\nAccording to Casey\u2019s office, the amendment would aid families by providing a 7 percent tax credit on up to $10,000 of the secondary earner\u2019s income. Qualifying families would be able to directly reduce their income tax bill by up to $700. This new credit would also reduce earned income for purposes of calculating the Earned Income Tax Credit.\n\nCurrently, parents are eligible to receive a credit of just $3,000 per child, and many low-income families don\u2019t even qualify for the credit, so the second provision of Casey and Baldwin\u2019s amendment would increase the maximum allowable expense limit for child care to $8,000, extend the maximum credit rate of 35 percent to all households making up to $110,000 a year, and make the credit fully refundable.\n\nThe Democrats propose to pay for the tax credits by enacting the so-called \u201cBuffett rule\u201d to raise taxes on the wealthy, by closing an executive compensation loophole that enables corporations to claim outsized tax breaks by paying their executives in stock options, and by making it harder for companies to incorporate abroad to avoid paying U.S. taxes.\n\nDemocrats have long sought such measures. Obama called on Congress to pass the Buffett rule in 2012, a year after billionaire investor Warren Buffett pointed out in a New York Times op-ed that rich people like him pay a smaller share of their income in federal taxes than middle-class taxpayers. The legislation would impose a 30 percent minimum tax on adjusted gross income for individuals making more than $1 million a year.\n\nRepublican leaders have derided past incarnations of the Buffett rule as \"class warfare.\"\n\nThe second way the amendment would pay for the tax breaks would be by targeting a tax loophole passed in 1993 that allows corporations to deduct the value of stock options or other rewards for CEOs and executives from the company's taxable income, as long as the pay is \u201cperformance-based.\" In practice, this means that the more the companies pay their executives, the less they pay in federal taxes. The Joint Committee on Taxation has estimated that closing the CEO pay loophole would save taxpayers $50 billion over 10 years. Democrats have proposed various bills to close the loophole, but none have gained traction.\n\nThe final measure to pay for the tax credits would echo legislation that Democrats have already introduced, designed to reduce U.S. companies' incentives to buy foreign companies and transfer their main business operations abroad to avoid U.S. taxes. Burger King announced it would do so last year by taking over the Canadian coffee and doughnuts chain Tim Hortons. Such \u201cinversions\u201d cost taxpayers billions of dollars.\n\nCasey and Baldwin\u2019s amendment would tighten rules for inverted companies, requiring that they be at least 50 percent foreign-owned, going beyond the current 20 percent rule. A company looking to invert by merging with a foreign company would have to merge with one at least as large as itself.\n\nThe Democrats\u2019 amendment is meant to test Republicans' sincerity when it comes to helping the middle class. During October's economy-focused Republican primary debate, the candidates brought up the middle class and workers repeatedly, even uttering the phrase \u201cincome inequality.\u201d Democrats have argued that the GOP isn\u2019t actually committed to helping the middle class, since many of the leading presidential candidates\u2019 tax plans would overwhelmingly benefit the wealthy.\n\nIn contrast, the leading Democratic presidential candidates -- former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) -- are debating progressive priorities like health care, child care and college, and how to pay for them.\n\nClinton has proposed a new tax credit for families caring for aging parents and grandparents or people with disabilities, promising that she would only impose new taxes on the wealthiest Americans as president. Her campaign has criticized Sanders for proposing legislation that would provide universal, single-payer health care financed by a payroll tax increase, arguing that any tax increase on the middle class is unacceptable.\n\nAlso on HuffPost:", "article_metadata": {"description": "The symbolic move will accompany the GOP's symbolic move to repeal Obamacare.", "sailthru.expire_date": "2015-12-04 10:12:58 -0500", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "The symbolic move will accompany the GOP's symbolic move to repeal Obamacare.", "title": "Democratic Senators Dare GOP To Vote Against Middle-Class Tax Breaks", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/senate-democrats-middle-class_us_565f1a3ce4b079b2818cbb4b", "image": "http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/2000_1000/565f1aca21000065005ac0af.jpeg?cache=xwyyv1042c", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The symbolic move will accompany the GOP's symbolic move to repeal Obamacare.", "creator": "@SamLachman", "image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/2000_1000/565f1aca21000065005ac0af.jpeg?cache=xwyyv1042c", "height": 1000}, "title": "Democratic Senators Dare GOP To Vote Against Middle-Class Tax Breaks", "site": "@HuffPostPol", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-12-03 10:12:58 -0500", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=us_565f1a3ce4b079b2818cbb4b", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "bob casey,bob casey senate,Senate Budget,middle class tax cuts, middle class,corporate inversions,buffet rule,child care tax credit,dual earner tax credit,tammy baldwin,Warren Buffett", "article": {"section": "Politics", "tag": "bob casey,bob casey senate,Senate Budget,middle class tax cuts, middle class,corporate inversions,buffet rule,child care tax credit,dual earner tax credit,tammy baldwin,Warren Buffett", "published_time": "2015-12-03 10:12:58 -0500", "modified_time": "2015-12-03 10:44:57 -0500"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "article_summary": "This new credit would also reduce earned income for purposes of calculating the Earned Income Tax Credit.\nThe Democrats' amendment is almost guaranteed to face GOP opposition, so it's largely a symbolic move.\nThe Democrats\u2019 amendment is meant to test Republicans' sincerity when it comes to helping the middle class.\nQualifying families would be able to directly reduce their income tax bill by up to $700.\nSen.
