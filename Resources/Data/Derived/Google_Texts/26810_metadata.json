However, authorities called off Sunday\u2019s festivities because of a tense atmosphere amid the political uncertainty.\n\nLawmakers are beginning a process to patch together a short-term interim government to smooth political divisions and fill the void left by Martelly\u2019s departure. Prime Minister Evans Paul remains in office for now, awaiting a provisional president to be chosen by Parliament in the coming days.\n\nHaiti last created a transitional government in 2004. That interim administration, which lasted for two years, took power in the chaotic days after President Jean Bertrand-Aristide was ousted by a rebellion and a U.N. peacekeeping force came to stabilize the country.\n\nThis time, with quarrelling factions again throwing Haiti into an electoral and constitutional crisis, a last-minute deal was forged by Martelly and lawmakers less than 24 hours before his scheduled departure from office. A special mission from the 35-nation Organization of American States was in Haiti to observe last week\u2019s negotiations and help foster dialogue.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Haiti\u2019s president departs to make way for interim government", "author": "David Mcfadden", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Haiti\u2019s president departs to make way for interim government", "title": "Haiti\u2019s president departs to make way for interim government", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/02/07/haitis_president_departs_to_make_way_for_interim_government/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/02/haiti-presidents-departure.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Haiti\u2019s president departs to make way for interim government", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/02/haiti-presidents-departure.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "title": "Haiti\u2019s president departs to make way for interim government", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Haiti\u2019s president departs to make way for interim government", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Prime Minister Evans Paul remains in office for now, awaiting a provisional president to be chosen by Parliament in the coming days.\nLawmakers are beginning a process to patch together a short-term interim government to smooth political divisions and fill the void left by Martelly\u2019s departure.\nThat interim administration, which lasted for two years, took power in the chaotic days after President Jean Bertrand-Aristide was ousted by a rebellion and a U.N. peacekeeping force came to stabilize the country.\nA special mission from the 35-nation Organization of American States was in Haiti to observe last week\u2019s negotiations and help foster dialogue.\nHowever, authorities called off Sunday\u2019s festivities because of a tense atmosphere amid the political uncertainty."}
