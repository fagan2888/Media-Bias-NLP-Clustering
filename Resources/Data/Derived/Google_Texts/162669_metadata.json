The goal is to directly contact 56,000 potential voters in communities across the state. If it succeeds, ISAIAH hopes it will acquire the clout to push progressive policies in the statehouse. It plans to pressure lawmakers to expand access to affordable health care, create more public transit options and work on educational initiatives to end the so-called school-to-prison pipeline.\n\nThe group says its get-out-the-vote effort will be nonpartisan, but it will ask potential voters to align themselves with ISAIAH\u2019s values of economic and racial equity and family security.\n\n\u201cAny election is a very public opportunity to have yourself heard if you speak with enough voices,\u201d said Ann Mongoven, an ISAIAH leader and member of St. Joan of Arc Catholic Community, a Minneapolis church. The effort, she said, \u201cpresents an opportunity to have a more important voice in policy changes.\u201d\n\nMongoven said the goal is to have voter turnout that more closely approximates a presidential election than a midterm.\n\nState election figures show that in the 2010 midterm, about 2.1 million Minnesotans out of an eligible 3.8 million cast ballots. By contrast, nearly 3 million Minnesotans went to the polls for the presidential election in 2012.\n\nClergy groups are no strangers to the political process. The state\u2019s Roman Catholic bishops in 2011, for instance, launched a formal effort to pass a 2012 amendment that would have prohibited same-sex marriage. (The measure was ultimately defeated.) That same year the Joint Religious Legislative Coalition, an interfaith group, opposed a proposal to expand gambling to fund the new Vikings stadium.\n\nISAIAH\u2019s mission includes advocating for low-income and minority communities it serves, particularly on issues involving housing, public transportation and racial inequity.\n\n\u201cIt has never been clearer that in our democracy some voices are being heard and others are not \u2014 with pain and unrest in Ferguson, gridlock on immigration reform and the growing income gap between the haves and the have-nots in our country,\u201d said the Rev. Paul Slack, pastor at New Creation Church in Minneapolis and ISAIAH president, at a news conference last week to unveil the effort. \u201cWe are here today because the people in our communities are suffering; because too many people in our state have lost hope in our democracy and because this election can and must be different.\u201d\n\nGroup leaders said one region they will focus on is St. Cloud, a city with a growing minority population. U.S. Census figures show that between 2000 and 2010, the city\u2019s black population grew more than 260 percent, to 5,152.\n\nClergy leaders there, such as the Rev. Randy Johnson, associate pastor of the First United Methodist Church of the St. Cloud Region, said minority communities are energized for the upcoming election. \u201cThere\u2019s a growing sense of what we can do together in St. Cloud,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cCommunities have lost faith and hope in political processes,\u201d Johnson said. This November \u201cwe\u2019re all in this together, and it\u2019s about opportunity for all Americans.\u201d\n\nBetween now and the November election, ISAIAH will phone-bank and knock on doors hoping to secure commitments from potential voters, organizers said. Johnson said his region\u2019s campaign will formally kick off with an event Oct. 9 that Gov. Mark Dayton has been invited to attend.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "A coalition of progressive religious leaders says it will work during this year&rsquo;s election to advocate for social justice policies and boost what typically is a low-turnout election.", "title": "Minnesota clergy group 'ISAIAH' mobilizing for election season", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/minnesota-clergy-group-isaiah-mobilizing-for-election-season/274229541/", "image": {"url": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_141004193435083.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "width": 1200, "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_141004193435083.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "twitter": {"description": "A coalition of progressive religious leaders says it will work during this year&rsquo;s election to advocate for social justice policies and boost what typically is a low-turnout election.", "title": "Minnesota clergy group 'ISAIAH' mobilizing for election season", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/minnesota-clergy-group-isaiah-mobilizing-for-election-season/274229541/", "image": {"src": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_141004193435083.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_141004193435083.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "description": "A coalition of progressive religious leaders says it will work during this year&rsquo;s election to advocate for social justice policies and boost what typically is a low-turnout election."}, "article_summary": "State election figures show that in the 2010 midterm, about 2.1 million Minnesotans out of an eligible 3.8 million cast ballots.\nThe goal is to directly contact 56,000 potential voters in communities across the state.\nThe group says its get-out-the-vote effort will be nonpartisan, but it will ask potential voters to align themselves with ISAIAH\u2019s values of economic and racial equity and family security.\nThis November \u201cwe\u2019re all in this together, and it\u2019s about opportunity for all Americans.\u201dBetween now and the November election, ISAIAH will phone-bank and knock on doors hoping to secure commitments from potential voters, organizers said.\nISAIAH, which includes more than 100 congregations around the state, said it is launching the \u201cProphetic Voter\u201d campaign."}
