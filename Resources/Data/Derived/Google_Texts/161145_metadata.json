Dave Heineman proposed spending $220 million of the state\u2019s record-high cash reserve in order to reduce income and property taxes over the next three years, leaving a half-billion-dollar cushion.\n\nCombine that with savings from holding state spending increases to about 4 percent, and the state could reduce taxes by $370 million to $500 million over the next three years, he said.\n\n\u201cThis year the focus should be on tax relief,\u201d he said during a rare evening press conference on the night before he delivers his State of the State speech to lawmakers. \u201cWe don\u2019t need more time to study this issue. The Legislature needs to act this session.\u201d\n\nHeineman said the state is sitting on a record $722 million cash cushion and should give some of it back to taxpayers. By dipping into cash reserves and holding the line on spending in the coming years, $370 million to $500 million is available and should be used for tax relief, he said. The Legislature\u2019s current estimate that spending will go up 4.7 percent in the next biennium would free up $370 million for tax cuts over the next three years, and a 4 percent growth rate in 2016 and 2017 would free up $500 million. Heineman said 4 percent increases are \u201creasonable and realistic.\u201d\n\nHe said leaving a half-billion in reserves is more than sufficient for a state with an annual $4 billion budget.\n\n\u201cWe now have the largest cash reserve we\u2019ve ever had,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are sitting on a bundle of cash. We are overtaxing our citizens right now, and they deserve some of it back.\u201d\n\nHe supports the Nebraska Farm Bureau proposal to reduce the valuation of ag from 75 percent of its actual value to 65 percent to help farmers and ranchers deal with record high property taxes. Property taxes are largely controlled by cities, counties and schools, but the state could lessen the load by adding state dollars to the state\u2019s property tax relief fund.\n\nHe also continued his push to reduce income tax rates, saying Nebraska\u2019s rates are among the highest in the nation \u2013 higher than all but one neighboring state. He\u2019s primarily focused on reducing individual income tax rates, since 90 percent of small businesses pay their taxes through the individual code.\n\nBefore the governor\u2019s press conference was even over, two prominent Democratic lawmakers immediately condemned the governor\u2019s proposal via Twitter.\n\n\u201cUsing one-time funding and risking Nebraska\u2019s fiscal health for (a) trickle-down tax plan is something that I cannot support,\u201d Sen. Heath Mello, D-Omaha, said.\n\nSen. Jeremy Nordquist, D-Omaha, accused the governor of trying to create a legacy during his last year in office at the expense of future generations.\n\n\u201cIt is clear that the governor has one priority: cutting taxes for the wealthiest Nebraskans,\u201d Nordquist said in a press statement. \u201cWe don\u2019t need to guess about what the governor\u2019s plan will do. Enormous tax giveaways for the wealthy did not create greater economic growth in Kansas; it created massive cuts to K-12 and higher education.\u201d\n\nKansas cut its top income tax rates in 2012 without cutting spending or projected revenue growth.\n\nBut Heineman said allegations that he\u2019s trying Kansas-style tax cuts were \u201cwrong, wrong, wrong.\u201d\n\nNordquist noted that a Mercatus Center report released Tuesday ranked Nebraska first in the nation for long-term cash solvency and fourth in overall fiscal health.\n\n\u201cWhy would we want to put our strong fiscal position in jeopardy?\u201d Nordquist asked. \u201cGovernor Heineman\u2019s legacy is not a good enough reason.\u201d\n\nHeineman said Nordquist is happy to spend money to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare. He said it\u2019s Nordquist and Mello\u2019s prerogative to oppose tax relief, but he\u2019s disappointed that \u201cthey certainly want to spend the money.\u201d\n\nHowever, he did not have a plan to continue paying for tax relief once the three years of transferring money from the state\u2019s cash reserve is up.\n\n\u201cWhoever\u2019s the governor and the Legislature will have to deal with it,\u201d he said.\n\nAlthough Heineman didn\u2019t get into specifics about his proposal, in December, he told the Washington Post he would push lawmakers to reduce the top personal income tax rate from 6.84 percent to below 6 percent.\n\nGrowing exasperated with reporters\u2019 questions, the governor suggested they get out of the capitol more often and talk to Nebraskans, and later said he\u2019d put in an amendment exempting the press from his tax cuts.\n\nContact Deena Winter at deena@nebraskawatchdog.org.
