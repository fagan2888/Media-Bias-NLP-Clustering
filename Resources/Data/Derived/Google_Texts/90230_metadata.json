It appears Obama is trying to turn us all into \u201cRedskins.\u201d\n\nMy new book, \u201cThe Murder of the Middle Class\u201d exposes how Obama is destroying America and our greatest asset, the middle class, from within. It is not happening by accident, mistake, or coincidence. This is a purposeful plan; a carbon copy of what the federal government did to Native Americans.\n\nThis isn\u2019t about physical murder. It\u2019s much worse. It\u2019s the murder of spirit, work ethic, ambition, personal responsibility, opportunity, mobility and hope. Those are the very qualities that produced the greatest and richest middle class in world history and made America the greatest nation on Earth.\n\nPhysical murder is fast and final. The murder of spirit and ambition is a slow, agonizing death. Share:\n\nPhysical murder is fast and final. The murder of spirit and ambition is a slow, agonizing death.\n\nThe best way to explain what Obama is doing to the middle class is to look back on the Native American experience. History repeats itself.\n\nAmerican Indians were a proud, brave, self-reliant people until they were conquered by the United States military. While atrocities were undoubtedly committed by both sides, America\u2019s goal was not genocide, it was to take control of the Native Americans.\n\nHow?\n\nWe herded them onto reservations and promised to take care of them. They\u2019d never have a need to hunt again so we took away their weapons. Of course, without weapons they could never again challenge anything their benevolent government did to them.\n\nWe gave them \u201cfree\u201d land, \u201cfree\u201d food, \u201cfree\u201d medical care, \u201cfree\u201d schooling and \u201cfree\u201dmoney. They\u2019d never again have to provide for themselves. It may sound like paradise, it was not.\n\nIt was a deal with the devil.\n\nNative Americans paid a huge price for those \u201cfree\u201d things. With the U.S. government \u201ctaking care of them,\u201d they forgot how to take care of themselves.\n\nThese great fighters forgot how to fight. These great hunters forgot how to hunt. A proud people lost ambition and hope to change their station in life. The result has been generations living in abject poverty and misery, dying of alcoholism, suicide, liver disease, and their children suffering from fetal alcohol syndrome.\n\nThis tragedy isn\u2019t temporary or short term. And 100 years later, it continues to get worse. According to the Indian Health Services, the rate of alcoholism today among Native Americans is SIX TIMES the U.S. average and 12 percent of the deaths of Native Americans are alcohol related. Fetal alcohol disorder is SEVEN TIMES the national average.\n\nSuicide is an epidemic among Native American teens, more than TRIPLE the rate of other young Americans. At some Indian reservations, teen suicide is nine to 19 times higher than among other youth.\n\nThe Washington Post reported on the national emergency this past March, describing the toxic problems experienced still by Native Americans \u2013 poverty, unemployment, domestic violence, sexual assault, alcoholism, drug addiction. The Post said the base of it all is \u201ccrushing hopelessness,\u201d describing their rate of post-traumatic stress disorder as rival to \u201cthe rates of returning veterans from Afghanistan.\u201d\n\nWhy are Native Americans in such crisis? Isn\u2019t the federal government \u201ctaking care of them?\u201d\n\nAh, there\u2019s the answer: The government. The same government that \u201cprovides\u201d for you also takes away your hope, self-respect, work ethic and ambition. Ah, those pesky unintended consequences.\n\nBy \u201cproviding for them,\u201d the government took away the Native Americans\u2019 ability to provide for themselves.\n\nThe murder of the middle class going on today under Obama is leading to a similar tragedy. It is being perpetrated by the same federal government who brought you the destruction of Native Americans. The same government that \u201cprovided for the every need\u201d of Native Americans now wants to provide for your every need from cradle to grave.\n\nThey offer \u201cfree\u201d money (welfare), \u201cfree\u201d food (food stamps), a salary without working (unemployment and disability), \u201cfree\u201d medical care (Obamacare), \u201cfree\u201d housing (housing allowances), \u201cfree\u201d meals at school, \u201cfree\u201d phones (Obamaphones), even \u201cfree\u201d contraception.\n\nBut there is a cost for \u201cfree.\u201d The cost is your soul, your spirit, your ambition, your achievement, your life. Government is a vampire that sucks the very blood out of your body.\n\nThis Obama government wants you helpless, hopeless, clueless, desperate, despondent, and dependent \u2013 just like Native Americans. Do you recognize the results?\n\nThese shocking results sound frighteningly similar to the Native American experience. This is the murder of the middle class.\n\nActions speak louder than words. It sure seems Obama is trying to introduce us all to the \u201cNative American Experience.\u201d\n\nSo let\u2019s stop worrying about the name \u201cRedskins.\u201d That\u2019s a classic Saul Alinsky distraction. Instead, let\u2019s put the focus on the really bad word\u2026\n\nWashington.\n\n\u2013\n\nTheBlaze contributor channel supports an open discourse on a range of views.
