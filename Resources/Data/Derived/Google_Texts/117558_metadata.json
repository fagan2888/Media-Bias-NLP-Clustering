He\u2019s being held on a $10,000 bond.\n\nThe former tween star, who is from Port Washington, alleged that he and his girlfriend Amanda Schutz encountered a group of people in the bar behaving rudely and he thought \u201cthere was going to be a brawl.\u201d\n\nAfter moving to pay the bill and grab their coats, Diamond said he turned to see his girlfriend bleeding as two men held her hair. A man then grabbed Diamond, and the actor said that he may have stabbed him. While Diamond originally claimed he used the pen he was signing the bar receipt with as a weapon, he later admitted to having a knife.\n\n\u201cDiamond stated that he did not intentionally stab the individual in the bar but that chaos broke out and people were grabbing at him and that he swung his arms to break free,\u201d reads the police report.\n\nOfficers found a \u201cstiletto folding knife with a 3.75-inch blade, which uses a thumb stud and assisted opening mechanism\u201d at the scene of the crime.\n\nOther witnesses spoke of a confrontation between two women that evolved into a larger fight. One of the women, witnesses explained, was complaining about people photographing her boyfriend. Should such a spontaneous photo op have occurred, it\u2019s probably a safe bet to assume that the former \u201cSaved by the Bell\u201d star was the subject.\n\nThe victim of Diamond\u2019s apparent stab suffered a non-life threatening wound and even said he didn\u2019t initially notice the cut. Perhaps he was undermining the damage out of embarrassment for being hurt by Screech.\n\nDiamond and Schutz fled the bar in a vehicle after the incident but were later stopped by police. Schutz was charged with disorderly conduct but released from police custody.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "According to CNN, actor Dustin Diamond -- most famous for his role as \"Screech\" in the '90s sitcom \"Saved by the Bell\" -- was arrested Friday for his involvement in a bar stabbing in Port Washington, Wisconsin.", "title": "Screech from 'Saved by the Bell' faces charges in bar stabbing -...", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 549, "identifier": "http://redalertpolitics.com/files/2014/12/saved-by-the-bell-549x400.jpg", "height": 400}, "url": "http://redalertpolitics.com/2014/12/28/screech-saved-ball-faces-charges-bar-stabbing/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 1285945407, "app_id": 529886110401651}, "msvalidate.01": "0F003B4674EABE0F24651B476B61A43C", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/RedAlertPolitics", "tag": "screech-saved-by-the-bell-bar-stabbing", "published_time": "2014-12-28T11:20:12+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-02T13:04:59+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1f25\"", "article_summary": "Should such a spontaneous photo op have occurred, it\u2019s probably a safe bet to assume that the former \u201cSaved by the Bell\u201d star was the subject.\nIt looks like Screech wasn\u2019t saved by the bell when he got arrested last week.\nAccording to CNN, actor Dustin Diamond \u2014 most famous for his role as \u201cScreech\u201d in the \u201990s sitcom \u201cSaved by the Bell\u201d \u2014 was arrested Friday for his involvement in a bar stabbing in Port Washington, Wisconsin.\nOne of the women, witnesses explained, was complaining about people photographing her boyfriend.\nDiamond and Schutz fled the bar in a vehicle after the incident but were later stopped by police."}
