So you wanna see some Canadian dudes take their clothes off, eh?

I’m allowed the lame “eh” joke because the Boylesque TO troupe that performs “Oh Manada!” emply every other Canadian reference we Americans have ever heard. Except maybe Wayne Gretzky. I don’t recall them mentioning Gretzky. Odd.

But I digress. Maybe I was distracted by the sparkly pasties once the guys get their Mountie uniform off.

Hosted by Alex Trebek (played by troupe- member Ginger Darling), this is a whole lot of silliness with a lot of actual skin. The five gents are fine looking and apparently sport good senses of humor. They aren’t your typical-stripper chiseled gym-bunny type, but as Alex tells us, Canada is really “a nation of mild-mannered cutie pies.”

Fair description. Except that I don't know a lot of "mild-mannered" people who whip their clothes off so frequently.

There’s a lumberjack scene that could give you chainsaw envy and a fun bit about how Canada’s healthcare system beats Obamacare. Sexy nurses, anyone?

A bit about a children’s book goes on too long, but a Justin Bieber number is quite amusing. At any rate, the audience is mainly there for one thing. To quote Alex again: “An eyeful of Canadian bacon.”
