WASHINGTON – Sen. Ted Cruz’s campaign rolled out two ads in Utah and Arizona on Thursday, ahead of Utah’s caucus and Arizona’s primary on Tuesday. The ads, geared toward voters in each state, seek to paint Cruz as a principled conservative and fighter for the law.

The first ad, titled “Lee,” features Utah Sen. Mike Lee, who last week became the first U.S. senator to endorse Cruz. South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham announced Thursday he would campaign with the Texas senator but stopped short of an official endorsement.

The ad, which will run in Utah, shows Lee saying Cruz vowed to fight government overreach and the Affordable Care Act, defend gun rights and protect religious liberty.

“Ted has kept those promises,” Lee says in the ad. “We need to unite behind Ted Cruz.”

The second ad, “Grant,” will air in Arizona statewide. It features Steve Ronnebeck of Mesa, Ariz., who tells the viewer that his son Grant was killed by an immigrant who arrived in the country illegally.

“He should’ve been deported,” Ronnebeck says in the ad, which lingers on pictures of Grant with his father, kneeling with a soccer ball and posing for a school photo. “My son’s death was completely preventable.”



“I trust Ted Cruz, he believes in our Constitution. He believes in the rule of law,” Ronnebeck continues. “It’s time we put somebody in office who puts the American people first.”

Together, Utah’s majority-takes-all caucus and Arizona’s winner-take-all primary put 98 delegates on the table for the three remaining Republican presidential candidates. A candidate needs 1,237 to win the nomination.
