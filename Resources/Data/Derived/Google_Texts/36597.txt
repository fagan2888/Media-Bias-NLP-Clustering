CLAREMONT — Lost My Way Shelter has started a GoFundMe.com account for an emaciated pit bull found starving and abandoned Thursday morning.“We call her Hope,” shelter founder Cathy Sullivan of Claremont said Sunday night...Hope was found by a couple walking their dog around 1:10 a.m. on Mulberry Street. She was lying beside the railroad tracks, unable to move or bark, Sullivan said.The GoFundMe.com account was started to raise money for Hope’s recovery. So far, just over $1,600 of the $5,000 fundraising goal has been reached...According to the page, “Hope’s body temperature was 92 degrees when she was found in the middle of the night, lying on the ground in the rain. She was unable to do more than wag her tail, which she does whenever she sees someone. Her weight is 27 pounds, about half of what she should weigh. She was approximately one hour from death when she was found. Hope will be facing months of medical care and rehabilitation.”..Sullivan’s best guess is that Hope is between 1 and 4 years old. Based on her condition, Sullivan believes Hope was abandoned. She had a clean coat and her nails and foot pads were in good condition.“This dog wasn’t out and about. This dog was not a stray dog,” she said...Hope is slowly making progress, Sullivan said.“One day at a time. We’ve only had her three days, so it’s going to take some time for her to recover,” Sullivan said. “She did take a few steps today.”Sullivan said anyone with information about Hope can contact Claremont police or call her at (603) 477-1229...mpierce@newstote.com..
