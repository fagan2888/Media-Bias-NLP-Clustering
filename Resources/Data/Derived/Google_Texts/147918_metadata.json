In the late 1970s, scientists discovered that 89 percent of formulations contained carcinogenic chemicals. So, dye manufacturers began using different chemicals, and some of those that were deemed carcinogenic, such as aromatic amines, were banned in cosmetic products in the European Union (The FDA regulates these products on a case-by-case basis.). But a new study from Lund University in Sweden has found that hairdressers may still be exposed to these carcinogens, and if so, they\u2019re getting in their blood every time someone walks into the salon.\n\nAccording to the National Cancer Institute, permanent hair dyes, also called oxidative dyes, are the ones most dangerous to hairdressers. Making up almost 80 percent of the dye market, people go to them because the only way to remove them is to grow out new hair. They work with the help of hydrogen peroxide, which causes a chemical reaction between so-called \u201cintermediates\u201d \u2014 the aromatic amines \u2014 and dye \u201ccouplers.\u201d In turn, the chemical reaction causes pigment molecules to form.\n\nMany of the aromatic amines called toluidines have been implicated in causing cancer, but ortho-toluidine (o-toluidine) has actually been confirmed as a carcinogenic. Altogether, these chemicals have been suspected of causing bladder cancer, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, leukaemia, and breast cancer. Considering the severity of these cancers, it would be in everyone\u2019s best interest to know what they\u2019re touching when they come into contact with hair dyes.\n\nFor their study, the researchers looked at o-toluidine levels in the blood, along with levels of seven other aromatic amines. Specifically, they looked at structures in the blood called hemoglobin adducts, which gave them a sense of long-term exposure to the carcinogen, as they showed how many molecules of hemoglobin had attached to molecules of the toluidines.\n\nTesting this method on 295 female hairdressers, 32 regular users of hair dye, and 60 people who hadn\u2019t used any products in a year, they found that hairdressers were indeed exposing themselves to o-toluidine and meta-toluidine (m-toluidine). What\u2019s more, hairdressers who performed more weekly hair dye or hair waving treatments tended to have higher concentrations of the carcinogens.\n\n\u201cThe latter was somewhat unexpected, but analysis of a common randomly-chosen product confirmed the presence of both o- and m-toluidine,\u201d the researchers wrote. They added that even with the variety of products hairdressers use, they were able to narrow down the source of o-toluidine to \u201clight-color permanent hair dyes and hair waving.\u201d\n\nThe findings may be especially troubling for hairdressers in Sweden, since most of the study population was based in the southern province of Scania in Sweden. The researchers called for further studies into the ingredients of current dyes, as the probability that these chemicals are being transferred from dyes and hair into water systems, the air, and the food supply.\n\nSource: Johansson G, Albin M, Lid\u00e9n C, et al.
