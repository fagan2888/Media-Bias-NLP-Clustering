Wait a tic, that can\u2019t be right. Oh wait, it totally is!\n\nIn a minor reform for the art capital, Italy has mandated that the food vendors serve up more produce, and that it\u2019s to be sourced locally and feature local dishes.\n\nHead to Florence, and you will find that nearly 70% of all the food served in restaurants there is locally sourced. (Way to go Italy!).\n\nSo what\u2019s the big idea then?\n\n\u201cWe are seeing an unstoppable distortion in our cultural heritage, of which food is a part,\u201d Mayor Dario Nardella said in a post on his Facebook page \u201cA restaurant opens every week in Florence, not to mention minimarkets and Asiamarkets.\u201d\n\nGood to hear, but how does this relate to eating fried cow noodles?\n\nIn efforts to preserve cultural heritage, these local food vendors may end up serving more fried cow\u2019s brains, according to Reuters. And it sounds like it may be more out of spite than anything else.\n\nSince local eateries in the area are being ordered to preserve the heritage, many may comply by offering up something that most tourists would never imagine sampling, a Florentine specialty, fried cow brains.\n\nAccording to a Wikipedia entry, \u201cBeef brains and veal (juvenile beef) or calf\u2019s brains are used in the cuisines of France; Italy; Spain; El Salvador; Mexico, etc. where they are called sesos in Spanish and are eaten in tacos and quesadillas; Pakistan, where they are known in Urdu as Maghaz; Portugal; Indonesia; and in the United States, especially in St. Louis, Missouri, and the Ohio River valley.\u201d\n\nBut they are not the only ones who think that cow brains are tasty fare. We took some time to dig up more information, and the food is so popular that Hubpages listed several recipes for a cow brain sandwich, veal brain nuggets and more.\n\nIt seems fitting to leave you with some related words of wisdom\n\n\u201cEverybody knows brains can be fried \u2013 just as all know they can be addled. We of the old South pickled ours. Go and do likewise if you want an experience.\u201d \u2013 Martha McCulloch-Williams, \u2018Dishes & Beverages of the Old South\u2019 (1913)\n\nAs far as actually eating the brains ourselves\u2026 we\u2019ll pass. But thanks for grossing us out.\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.4.3", "og": {"site_name": "Now It Counts", "description": "When you are in Italy\u2026 you eat ____ (fill in the blank).
