Those in favor say the sea walls are a necessary evil, and one that will provide some jobs, at least for a time.\n\nIn the northern fishing port of Osabe, Kazutoshi Musashi chafes at the 12.5-meter (41-foot)-high concrete barrier blocking his view of the sea.\n\n\u201cThe reality is that it looks like the wall of a jail,\u201d said Musashi, 46, who lived on the seaside before the tsunami struck Osabe and has moved inland since.\n\nPouring concrete for public works is a staple strategy for the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and its backers in big business and construction, and local officials tend to go along with such plans.\n\nThe paradox of such projects, experts say, is that while they may reduce some damage, they can foster complacency. That can be a grave risk along coastlines vulnerable to tsunamis, storm surges and other natural disasters. At least some of the 18,500 people who died or went missing in the 2011 disasters failed to heed warnings to escape in time.\n\nTsuneaki Iguchi was mayor of Iwanuma, a town just south of the region\u2019s biggest city, Sendai, when the tsunami triggered by a magnitude-9 earthquake just off the coast inundated half of its area.\n\nA 7.2-meter (24-foot) -high sea wall built years earlier to help stave off erosion of Iwanuma\u2019s beaches slowed the wall of water, as did stands of tall, thin pine trees planted along the coast. But the tsunami still swept up to 5 kilometers (3 miles) inland. Passengers and staff watched from the upper floors and roof of the airport as the waves carried off cars, buildings and aircraft, smashing most homes in densely populated suburbs not far from the beach.\n\nThe city repaired the broken sea walls but doesn\u2019t plan to make them any taller. Instead, Iguchi was one of the first local officials to back a plan championed by former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa to plant mixed forests along the coasts on tall mounds of soil or rubble, to help create a living \u201cgreen wall\u201d that would persist long after the concrete of the bigger, man-made structures has crumbled.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need the sea wall to be higher. What we do need is for everyone to evacuate,\u201d Iguchi said.\n\n\u201cThe safest thing is for people to live on higher ground and for people\u2019s homes and their workplaces to be in separate locations. If we do that, we don\u2019t need to have a \u2018Great Wall,'\u201d he said.\n\nWhile the lack of basic infrastructure can be catastrophic in developing countries, too heavy a reliance on such safeguards can lead communities to be too complacent at times, says Margareta Wahlstrom, head of the U.N.\u2019s Office for Disaster Risk Reduction.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a bit of an overbelief in technology as a solution, even though everything we have learned demonstrates that people\u2019s own insights and instincts are really what makes a difference, and technology in fact makes us a bit more vulnerable,\u201d Wahlstrom said in an interview ahead of a recent conference in Sendai convened to draft a new framework for reducing disaster risks.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Japan opts for massive, costly sea wall to fend off tsunamis", "title": "Japan opts for massive, costly sea wall to fend off tsunamis", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Japan opts for massive, costly sea wall to fend off tsunamis", "title": "Japan opts for massive, costly sea wall to fend off tsunamis", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/03/22/japan_opts_for_massive_costly_sea_wall_to_fend_off_tsunamis/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/japan-great-sea-wall.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Japan opts for massive, costly sea wall to fend off tsunamis", "title": "Japan opts for massive, costly sea wall to fend off tsunamis", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/japan-great-sea-wall.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Elaine Kurtenbach", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Those in favor say the sea walls are a necessary evil, and one that will provide some jobs, at least for a time.\nA 7.2-meter (24-foot) -high sea wall built years earlier to help stave off erosion of Iwanuma\u2019s beaches slowed the wall of water, as did stands of tall, thin pine trees planted along the coast.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need the sea wall to be higher.\nThe city repaired the broken sea walls but doesn\u2019t plan to make them any taller.\nIn the northern fishing port of Osabe, Kazutoshi Musashi chafes at the 12.5-meter (41-foot)-high concrete barrier blocking his view of the sea."}
