Flights were rerouted to avoid the balloon. Denver International Airport briefly closed.\n\nWhen the balloon finally collapsed onto a field near Keenesburg at 1:35 p.m., Falcon Heene was not inside. He was found in the Heene family\u2019s attic.\n\nMost onlookers were livid, but Recce was amused. He thought the hoax offered rich material for a musical, and began writing.\n\n\u201cIt started as very brutal, biting satire, with a seventh-grade mentality, but as it\u2019s progressed I\u2019ve tried to make the characters more human,\u201d Recce said.\n\n\u201cI wanted it to be a satirical story about the American media, and I wanted it to have a sense of humor, like \u2018Saturday Night Live\u2019 or \u2018Bat Boy The Musical\u2019 or \u2018Little Shop of Horrors.\u2019 I call it a musical comedy.\u201d\n\nRecently, Recce, now a 16-year-old senior at Hauppauge High School on Long Island in New York, learned that \u201cBalloon Boy\u201d won the Thespian Festival musical works competition for the best student-created opening number for a musical. Here\u2019s a sample of Follow Your Dream\u201d:\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t life amazing?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s wonderful what you can do\n\n\u201cFame can be given on a platter\n\n\u201cAll you need is a weather balloon\n\n\u201cFollow your dreams\n\n\u201cNo matter how hard it seems\n\n\u201cYou may seem odd\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just a fa\u00e7ade\u2026\n\n\u201cWe are a special family, a multitalented family\n\n\u201cWe seek fame.\u201d\n\nRecce\u2019s \u201cFollow Your Dream\u201d beat eight other entries, earning him the chance to develop \u201cBalloon Boy\u201d in a workshop at the 2014 International Thespian Festival in Lincoln, Neb., next week.\n\nThe Heene family relocated from Fort Collins to Florida after the father, Richard, pleaded guilty to a felony and was fined $36,000. Falcon and his brothers formed a band that received some media attention, all of it linked to the 2009 mishap.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t heard from them, but I\u2019d hope they\u2019d like the show,\u201d Recce said.\n\n\u201cI think the show doesn\u2019t glorify what they did. It\u2019s about the driving want they had, the length they\u2019ll go to to achieve what they want, and where their natural human desire takes them.\u201d\n\nClaire Martin: 303-954-1477, cmartin@denverpost.com or twitter.com/byclairemartin\n\nBalloon boy: the musical\n\nA high school junior from Long Island, NY, wins a student competition for best opening song for an original musical about a publicity-hungry family who got national attention in 2009 when they claimed their 6-year-old was in a runaway weather balloon.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Taking flight: \u201cBalloon Boy: The Musical,\u201d based on 2009 Colorado hoax", "title": "Taking flight: \u201cBalloon Boy: The Musical,\u201d based on 2009 Colorado hoax", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/06/16/taking-flight-balloon-boy-the-musical-based-on-2009-colorado-hoax/", "image": {"width": 540, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140616__FE19STBALLOONBOYp1.jpg", "height": 576}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140616__FE19STBALLOONBOYp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-16T17:42:27+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T06:21:15+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Helicopters and breathless announcers followed the 60-mile flight as the weather balloon made its uncertain way through Weld and Adams counties.\nThe Heene family relocated from Fort Collins to Florida after the father, Richard, pleaded guilty to a felony and was fined $36,000.\nWhen the balloon finally collapsed onto a field near Keenesburg at 1:35 p.m., Falcon Heene was not inside.\nFalcon and his brothers formed a band that received some media attention, all of it linked to the 2009 mishap.\nHe thought the hoax offered rich material for a musical, and began writing."}
