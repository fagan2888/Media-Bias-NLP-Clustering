Best has revised the outlook to positive from stable and affirmed the financial strength rating (FSR) of A- (Excellent) and the issuer credit ratings (ICR) of \u201ca-\u201d of Delta Dental of California (DDC) (San Francisco, CA) and its affiliate, Delta Dental Insurance Company (DDIC) (Wilmington, DE).\n\nConcurrently, A.M. Best has revised the outlook to positive from stable and affirmed the ICRs of \u201cbbb\u201d of Delta Dental of Pennsylvania (DDP) (Mechanicsburg, PA) and its affiliate, Delta Dental of New York (DDNY) (New York, NY), and also affirmed the FSR of B++. The FSR outlooks remain stable.\n\nDDC, DDP and DDIC, together with their affiliate companies and DDNY, form one of the country\u2019s largest dental benefit systems which is ultimately controlled by Dentegra Group, Inc. (Dentegra). Dentegra is a non-profit Delaware holding company, formed by DDC and DDP, whose purpose is to oversee and coordinate the strategic activities of both entities and their affiliates.\n\nThe ratings actions for DDC and DDIC reflect improved capitalization, an economic shift to a higher level of earnings and the execution of business expansion strategies. Collectively, the companies achieved their highest level of capitalization in each of the past five years. Capital development was supported by a shift to stronger earnings, particularly in 2013 and 2014. The organization has spent several years streamlining operations and investing and modernizing its technology infrastructure to improve efficiency. This was done in support of executing a business expansion strategy designed to raise market penetration in both the insured and uninsured markets, and has resulted in significant membership growth, record levels of premium development and strong earnings.\n\nDDP and DDNY have reported significant improvements in capital over the past five years. The recognition of favorable asset appreciation and strong operating performance led to the doubling of capital and surplus over the period. Operating capacity has been expanded through higher working capital measures. Membership retention and direct sales have achieved historical highs in revenue development and earnings. The organization has won key bids for both commercial and government-sponsored business, securing its position among the leaders in the broadening market-place. After adding a number of new state licenses, the scope of its operations have expanded significantly.\n\nPartially offsetting these strengths are the competitive business environment and the challenges in expanding to new geographies. Competition for new business is requiring more than pricing concessions and new product designs. Additionally, the organization will need to integrate distribution services with new partners and customize products to meet virtual access demanded by younger members and providers. Furthermore, the organization is continuing to find ways to lower its exposure to business concentration risk. The group of companies in the Mid-Atlantic region, which includes DDPA and DDNY, is pursuing a number of business combinations that will assist medical-only plans in achieving the essential health benefit requirements of the Affordable Care Act for pediatric dental and vision care services. Geographic expansion allows the organization to offer a national platform with products such as its individual co-branded, preventive care dental health maintenance organization (HMO) design. Complicating the strategy to improve its position in the region are the varied statutory rules in the application process and strong competition from seasoned participants in the core New York, Pennsylvania and New England markets.\n\nKey factors that could lead to positive rating action include continued favorable trends in membership, premiums and earnings. Key rating factors that could lead to a return to stable outlook include the deterioration in operating results or decreasing membership.\n\nA.M. Best deviated from its \u201cRating Members of Insurance Groups\u201d criteria report because full rating enhancement was afforded to DDNY, despite DDP not having direct ownership of DDNY. However, DDP and DDNY share financial support agreements, common management and a common mission. As such, A.M. Best expects that the boards of directors would act to support both entities within the group.\n\nThe methodology used in determining these ratings is Best\u2019s Credit Rating Methodology, which provides a comprehensive explanation of A.M.
