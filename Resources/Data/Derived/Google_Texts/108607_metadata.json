It's a huge production with more than 100 kids on stage, some having more than one costume. And one lady was responsible for them all.\n\n\"I started in the beginning of the summer,\" said Julie Burton, who created all the costumes for the production.\n\nShe said she loves it; that it's like giving each character an identity, \"Helping that character come to life on stage,\" Burton said.\n\nThere are places that rent costumes for particular shows, but then there are problems with fit and color, so she did them all herself.\n\n\"I looked at pictures. I looked at pictures on the Internet, I figured out how to make stuff.\"\n\nPerhaps the one she's most proud of is the costume for Lord Farquad. To emphasize the character's shortness, the actor who plays him walks on his knees.\n\n\"The reason his cape is so long is 'cause it has to cover up his feet in the back,\" said Burton. \"He's got these fake funny legs that connect in these holes. Then it connects around his waist. He's got gloves, he's got a head piece that matches his shirt.\"\n\nAnd that's just one, seems like a tremendous amount of work.\n\nFind Tickets Online.\n\n\"That's what theater is, you work all this time for four shows,\" Burton said.\n\nBut the memories for the actors, the audience and the costumer will last long after everything is put away.\n\nShrek the musical runs at Union High Wednesday through Saturday and tickets are available online.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-14", "Description": "Union High School's production of, \"Shrek, the Musical,\" has over 100 costumes, and one woman was responsible for them all.", "author": "Rick Wells", "og": {"url": "http://www.newson6.com/story/24645781/one-tulsa-woman-creates-100-plus-costumes-for-high-school-play", "image": "http://KOTV.images.worldnow.com/images/24645781_SA.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Union High School's production of, \"Shrek, the Musical,\" has over 100 costumes, and one woman was responsible for them all.", "title": "Tulsa Woman Creates 100-Plus Costumes For High School Play"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KOTV.images.worldnow.com/images/24645781_SA.jpg", "description": "Union High School's production of, \"Shrek, the Musical,\" has over 100 costumes, and one woman was responsible for them all.", "card": "summary", "title": "Tulsa Woman Creates 100-Plus Costumes For High School Play"}, "wnreadableurl": "one-tulsa-woman-creates-100-plus-costumes-for-high-school-play", "ROBOTS": "Index,Follow,NoArchive", "owner": "KOTV", "fb": {"app_id": 497059410331845}, "date": "2014/02/05", "KEYWORDS": "tulsa,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,kotv.com,channel 6,channel six,green country,television,the news on 6,the news on six,six in the morning,live", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS23", "verify-v1": "67+ifqPKEX7ZTB2sopjxTD1c6nx6ScxupNN92EqnIpc=", "news_keywords": "tulsa,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,kotv.com,channel 6,channel six,green country,television,the news on 6,the news on six,six in the morning,live"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2e0a\"", "article_summary": "She said she loves it; that it's like giving each character an identity, \"Helping that character come to life on stage,\" Burton said.\n\"That's what theater is, you work all this time for four shows,\" Burton said.\n\"I started in the beginning of the summer,\" said Julie Burton, who created all the costumes for the production.\nIt's a huge production with more than 100 kids on stage, some having more than one costume.\nThere are places that rent costumes for particular shows, but then there are problems with fit and color, so she did them all herself."}
