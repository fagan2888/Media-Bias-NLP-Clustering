The new motion comes after the defense\u2019s efforts failed to put Fox News reporter Jana Winter \u2014 who broke the story about the notebook \u2014 under oath to testify about her sources.\n\nIn its motion, the defense says gunman James Holmes \u201cwill be the one to bear the consequences of the government\u2019s violations of the pre-trial publicity order and the law\u201d if no further action is taken.\n\nThe fight over who told Winter about the notebook is one of the longest-running battles of the court case. Five days after the July 2012 shooting that killed 12 and wounded many more, Winter reported that a notebook Holmes mailed to his psychiatrist just prior to the attack contained violent images and plans for an attack. She cited two unnamed law enforcement officials.\n\nDefense attorneys said the leak was a violation of the gag order in the case and filed a motion for sanctions that resulted in multiple officers who saw the notebook being quizzed under oath. When none of the officers admitted to being the source of the leak \u2014 or, even, of seeing inside the notebook well enough to read the words on the page \u2014 Holmes\u2019 attorneys tried to put Winter on the stand.\n\nThe effort ended in May, when the U.S. Supreme Court declined to review a New York court ruling that found Winter was protected by that state\u2019s reporter shield law. Samour then denied the long-pending motion for sanctions.\n\nThe new motion claims the Arapahoe County district attorney\u2019s office, which is prosecuting the case, \u201chas failed to employ its resources to vigorously pursue the source of the leak or identify any perjured testimony despite the serious issues at stake.\u201d\n\nThe defense says a special prosecutor should be appointed to investigate the leak. It also suggests tossing out the death penalty or excluding the officers who have previously testified about the notebook \u2014 which includes one of the case\u2019s supervisory detectives \u2014 from testifying at trial.\n\nProsecutors have yet to respond to the new motion.\n\nHolmes is scheduled to go on trial in December.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "James Holmes\u2019 lawyers want special prosecutor over notebook leak", "title": "James Holmes\u2019 lawyers want special prosecutor over notebook leak", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/08/11/james-holmes-lawyers-want-special-prosecutor-over-notebook-leak/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140530__OP02HOLMESp1-2.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140530__OP02HOLMESp1-2.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-11T13:57:57+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T08:24:15+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The fight over who told Winter about the notebook is one of the longest-running battles of the court case.\nThe defense in the Aurora movie theater shooting case, still angered over an apparent law enforcement leak of information about a crucial notebook, has asked the judge to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate.\nFive days after the July 2012 shooting that killed 12 and wounded many more, Winter reported that a notebook Holmes mailed to his psychiatrist just prior to the attack contained violent images and plans for an attack.\nThe new motion comes after the defense\u2019s efforts failed to put Fox News reporter Jana Winter \u2014 who broke the story about the notebook \u2014 under oath to testify about her sources.\nIn its motion, the defense says gunman James Holmes \u201cwill be the one to bear the consequences of the government\u2019s violations of the pre-trial publicity order and the law\u201d if no further action is taken."}
