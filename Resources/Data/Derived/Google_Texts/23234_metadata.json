In 2013, it decided a pair of cases involving same-sex marriage, as well as one involving voter ID laws. And last year, it took on cases involving women\u2019s health and labor unions.\n\nBut even if you\u2019re not a Supreme Court or legal junkie, this month\u2019s docket will be one to follow \u2014 and it could be one of the most consequential strings of decisions in the high court\u2019s history.\n\nObergefell v. Hodges\n\nThis case encompasses others involving marriage equality, and it could lead to a landmark decision that would, in effect, give same-sex couples the constitutional right to marry.\n\nAt the heart of the case are two questions: Does the U.S. constitution \u2014 specifically, the 14th Amendment\u2019s Equal Protection Clause \u2014 require states to provide a license to marriage to gay couples? And does it require states to recognize an out-of-state marriage and provide benefits to couples who were lawfully married out of state?\n\nIt could lead to a landmark decision that would, for all intents and purposes, legalize gay marriage throughout the country. And it could also roil the 2016 presidential race at a time when it starts to gain steam, as Republican candidates remain split on the issue.\n\nContinuing a remarkable trend over the past decade, a majority of American voters say they would back a Supreme Court decision that grants same-sex couples the right to marry. According to a Quinnipiac University poll released on Monday, 56 percent of voters would back such a decision, compared with 38 percent who would oppose it.\n\nBut there\u2019s a clear partisan split \u2014 70 percent of Democrats would support that Supreme Court decision, compared to just 34 percent of Republicans. On this issue, Independents (61 percent) align more with Democrats.\n\nDuring oral arguments, justices offered mixed signals. Most of the attention focused on Justice Anthony Kennedy, who is expected to be the swing vote in the case. He expressed both concerns about redefining the concept of marriage, as well as excluding gay couples from the institution.\n\nKing v. Burwell\n\nIt\u2019s not a stretch to say this case could be more meaningful for the future of Obamacare than the 2012 case. In 2012, most of the law had not been implemented. But three years later, the potential effects of taking benefits away from millions of people looms over the case.\n\nThis legal challenge centers on four words \u2014 \u201cestablished by the state.\u201d The challengers argue that the federal government does not have the power to issue tax credits, or subsidies, to individuals purchasing health insurance through federal marketplaces.\n\nThat\u2019s because, they charge, the law\u2019s authors intended for individual states to establish exchanges on which people could buy insurance. The federal government ended up controlling 37 states\u2019 marketplaces, mostly from Republican-led states resistant to the law.\n\nBut supporters of the law \u2014 including its authors \u2014 scoff at the premise of the challenge.\n\n\u201cThe authors of the ACA never intended for state boundaries to become fences,\u201d Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-New York) said on a conference call with reporters earlier this year. \u201cIt would be devastating to millions of families \u2026 It would do nothing short of throwing our health care system into chaos.\u201d\n\nThe potential ramifications are enormous. The non-partisan RAND Corporation estimated this year that about 8 million people would lose coverage if that part of the law is overturned. Enrollment in the exchanges would decline by about 70 percent. Insurance premiums would skyrocket by about 47 percent in the individual market. And according to the nonpartisan advisory and consulting firm Avalere Health, those relying on subsidies could see whopping 122 percent to 774 percent premium increases.\n\nGlossip v. Gross\n\nThis case centers on whether an individual drug administered in death-penalty executions constitutes cruel and unusual punishment.\n\nPlaintiffs argue that the drug in the case, midazolam, does not produce unconsciousness before the state subsequently injects inmates with other drugs that cause paralysis and then death.\n\nThe state of Oklahoma argues that midazolam is safe, effective, and humane. But the drug has come under intense scrutiny following the botched execution in 2014 of Clayton Lockett, who regained consciousness during the process and eventually died of a heart attack. A lower court has ruled in favor of the state.\n\nThe case comes in the midst of an increasingly charged debate over the future of the death penalty, as even red-state Nebraska has moved to abolish it.\n\nMore cases you should be familiar with\n\nWalker v. Sons of Confederate Veterans: The case revolves around the Confederate Flag \u2014 specifically, whether a state can ban it from appearing on speciality license plates or whether it qualifies as free speech.\n\nTexas Department of Housing v. Inclusive Communities Project: A housing discrimination case that centers on the concept of \u201cdisparate impact,\u201d a legal theory that has helped minorities and others to prove discrimination by showing that certain housing practices have discriminatory effects on their populations.\n\nZivotofsky v. Kerry: It tackles whether parents\u2019 desire to have their child recognized as born in \u201cJerusalem, Israel,\u201d interferes with the president\u2019s power of recognition. The U.S. says that Jerusalem\u2019s status must be resolved through negotiations between Israel and Palestine, and it does not recognize Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://fusion.net/wp-content/themes/fusion-theme/assets/images/favicons/browserconfig.xml?v=1462067892199", "msapplication-TileColor": "#da532c", "description": "June is going to be a gigantic month at the Supreme Court, with cases involving gay marriage, the Affordable Care Act, and the death penalty.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Fusion", "description": "June is going to be a gigantic month at the Supreme Court, with cases involving gay marriage, the Affordable Care Act, and the death penalty.", "title": "The Next Few Weeks at the Supreme Court Are Going to Be Huge \u2014 Here\u2019s What\u2019s on Tap", "url": "http://fusion.net/story/142874/supreme-court-2015-decisions-obamacare/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://i2.wp.com/fusion.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/gettyimages-471432078.jpg?resize=1200%2C630&quality=80&strip=all", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "June is going to be a gigantic month at the Supreme Court, with cases involving gay marriage, the Affordable Care Act, and the death penalty.", "title": "The next few weeks at the Supreme Court are going to be huge \u2014", "url": "http://fusion.net/story/142874/supreme-court-2015-decisions-obamacare/", "image": "http://i2.wp.com/fusion.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/gettyimages-471432078.jpg?resize=560%2C294&quality=80&strip=all", "site": "@fusion", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Fusion.net", "pocket-site-verification": "81a5587d6c56043280b2554922f43d", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6a5260d31ead375c331934cb6df4833"}, "fb": {"app_id": 796694167041552}, "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://fusion.net/wp-content/themes/fusion-theme/assets/images/favicons/mstile-144x144.png?v=1462067892199", "application-name": "Fusion.net", "msvalidate.01": "0EABD001D404EA9DDE2025E9E4F14CAF", "google-site-verification": "BKw_9qDU04u2w1WoNF53fplAwWXVK_DJ1b6rZDR5u-M", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Politics"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdca95\"", "article_summary": "But there\u2019s a clear partisan split \u2014 70 percent of Democrats would support that Supreme Court decision, compared to just 34 percent of Republicans.\nJune is going to be a gigantic month at the Supreme Court, with cases involving gay marriage, the Affordable Care Act, and the death penalty.\nContinuing a remarkable trend over the past decade, a majority of American voters say they would back a Supreme Court decision that grants same-sex couples the right to marry.\nIn 2013, it decided a pair of cases involving same-sex marriage, as well as one involving voter ID laws.\nAnd does it require states to recognize an out-of-state marriage and provide benefits to couples who were lawfully married out of state?"}
