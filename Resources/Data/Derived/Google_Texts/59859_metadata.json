He's charged with first-degree murder in the shooting death of 18-year-old Velik Henderson of Overland Park. Henderson was killed June 30 along with 19-year-old Trevon Anderson of Kansas City, Kansas.\n\nThe homicides occurred on the same Overland Park block where a woman was killed and her 11-year-old daughter was wounded six days later. The slain woman has been identified as 36-year-old Quaushey Harris.\n\nAnother man was charged earlier this month with first-degree murder in the double homicide.\n\nHe and Stokes are both jailed on $2 million bond. It's not immediately clear if Stokes has an attorney.\n\nPolice say an 18-year-old man sought in double homicide in Kansas has been located.\n\nOverland Park police said in a news release that the man was found Saturday in the Kansas City area. The release didn't refer to the man as a suspect, and he faces no charges. Police say detectives will attempt to speak to him about the June 30 killings of 18-year-old Velik Henderson of Overland Park and 19-year-old Trevon Anderson of Kansas City, Kansas.\n\nThe homicides occurred on the same block where a woman was killed and her 11-year-old daughter was wounded six days later.
