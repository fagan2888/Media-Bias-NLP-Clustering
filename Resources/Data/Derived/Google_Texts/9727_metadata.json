Previously the company had offered self-insurance to groups of 100 or more.\n\nAmeriHealth said its research has found there are about 295,000 employers in New Jersey with 50 to 99 employees, of whom about 30,000 are currently self-funded.\n\n\n\nA number of health plan providers, including QualCare and MagnaCare, specialize in self-insured plans for small employers and have seen demand rise as employers look to control their health care costs.\n\n\n\nExperts say employers can save money with lower claims under self-insurance, if their employees are relatively healthy \u2014 and self-insured plans include stop-loss insurance that protects the employer against unexpected spikes in claims.\n\n\n\nMike Munoz, senior vice president of sales and marketing for AmeriHealth New Jersey, said AmeriHealth launched the product because small businesses were looking for alternatives.\n\n\n\nHe said AmeriHealth is seeing demand from employers and their health insurance brokers: \u201cA lot of employers are interested in looking at this.\u201d\n\n\n\nAmeriHealth is offering six standard plans with a range of deductibles and prices. Employers will pay no more than $25,000 for an individual claim before the stop-loss coverage kicks in. Stop-loss coverage also covers aggregate claims that exceed 125 percent of expected total clams.\n\nCLICK HERE to subscribe to the NJBIZ email newsletter\n\n\n\nMunoz said employer interest in self-insurance has been spurred by the Affordable Care Act, which in 2015 will require employers with more than 50 workers to offer coverage to full-time workers or pay a penalty. Self-insurance plans save money in part because they aren\u2019t subject to most of the new health insurance premium taxes imposed by the ACA.\n\n\n\nSome industry experts estimate employers can save as much as 10 percent on their health plan costs by switching to self-insurance.\n\n\n\nMunoz said self-insurance works for employers who \u201care willing to take the risk of being able to benefit from any savings you might be able to achieve from your employee population being healthier. That is why most employers look at self-insurance \u2014 they feel their employee population may be healthier than the norm and hence benefit from lower claims.\u201d\n\n\n\nMedical claims \u201care the key driver of costs for any employer,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nIf the employee population is healthier than the norm, \u201cThey will benefit because their claims expense will be less,\u201d he said. And if the employees turn out not to be as healthy as hoped, the stop-loss insurance caps the employer\u2019s exposure.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf you are willing to take a gamble you might benefit from self-insurance,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nAmeriHealth covers 350,000 lives in New Jersey, of whom 230,000 are covered through employer groups and the rest are individual customers, Munoz said.\n\nALSO ON NJBIZ:\n\nSeattle's approval of $15 minimum wage is cause for major concern in N.J.\n\nRWJ, Somerset hospitals complete merger\n\nN.J. real estate firms sell Manhattan site for $99M", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "NJBIZ", "description": "Small businesses looking to reduce health care costs by switching to self-insurance have a new option:", "title": "Self-insurance may be key for small businesses in N.J. | NJBIZ", "url": "http://www.njbiz.com/article/20140603/NJBIZ01/140609919/selfinsurance-may-be-key-for-small-businesses-in-nj", "image": "http://www.njbiz.com/storyimage/NJ/20140603/NJBIZ01/140609919/AR/0/AR-140609919.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "njbiz.com", "description": "Small businesses looking to reduce health care costs by switching to self-insurance have a new option:", "creator": "@bethfitzgerald8", "image": {"src": "http://www.njbiz.com/storyimage/NJ/20140603/NJBIZ01/140609919/AR/0/AR-140609919.jpg"}, "title": "Self-insurance may be key for small businesses in N.J. | NJBIZ", "site": "@njbiz", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "description": "Small businesses looking to reduce health care costs by switching to self-insurance have a new option:", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9bae\"", "article_summary": "Self-insurance plans save money in part because they aren\u2019t subject to most of the new health insurance premium taxes imposed by the ACA.\nSmall businesses looking to reduce health care costs by switching to self-insurance have a new option:AmeriHealth New Jersey announced Monday that it\u2019s offering self-funded plans to employers with 51-99 employees.\nAnd if the employees turn out not to be as healthy as hoped, the stop-loss insurance caps the employer\u2019s exposure.\nSome industry experts estimate employers can save as much as 10 percent on their health plan costs by switching to self-insurance.\nMike Munoz, senior vice president of sales and marketing for AmeriHealth New Jersey, said AmeriHealth launched the product because small businesses were looking for alternatives."}
