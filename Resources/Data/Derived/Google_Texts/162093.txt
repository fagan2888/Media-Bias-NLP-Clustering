How many years have you been in the St. Vrain Valley? I've lived here most of my life.

What brought you here? What has kept you here? It' pretty close to everything. It's not too big of a city. We have friends here.

Why cosmetology? I've always really been interested in it, and I really enjoy it. It's really fun to learn to style hair to make certain features more prominent. I work at Sport Clips. Cutting and styling guys' hair is really my strength in the class.

What have you liked the most about high school and what would you change? I've really enjoyed the teachers. They have looked out for my best interests. If I could go back, I would have been less shy going into high school. I didn't know anybody when I started high school.

What's your dream job? I really want to go into criminology. Cutting hair will be a way to help me get through college.
