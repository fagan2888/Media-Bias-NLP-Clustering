Irene Aguilar (D-Denver) told The Durango Herald:\n\n\u201cThe uncertainty that we continue to have in our health-care system \u2026 made people hungry for something a little bit different. \u201cThe frustration with Congress \u2026 provides a good tilling of the soil for the possibility of Colorado designing its own system.\u201d\n\nObamacare allows the states to obtain waivers to create their own health care systems, if they meet its conditions.\n\nColoradoCare would eliminate private insurance so the state can cover health expenses by having Colorado residents pay a 10% premium tax; employers pay 6.67% of the 10% from their employees wage and benefit package, and employees are responsible for 3.33%.\n\nThis amounts to a $25 billion tax increase, according to The Durango Herald.\n\nTechnically, a single-payer health care system is one in which governments, rather than insurers, pay for all health care costs. Canada and Taiwan have this system; Germany has over 150 \u201csickness funds\u201d citizens can join, or pay for private insurance; the Swiss and Dutch health systems are similar to the ACA\u2019s health-insurance exchanges.\n\nYears before winning the White House, President Obama was a vocal supporter of a single-payer health care system. In 2003, the then-Illinois state Sen. Obama told a union crowd:\n\n\u201cI happen to be a proponent of a single-payer, universal health care plan. \u2026 \u201cBut as all of you know, we may not get there immediately. Because first we\u2019ve got to take back the White House, we\u2019ve got to take back the Senate, and we\u2019ve got to take back the House.\u201d\n\nAnd in April 2008, as the White House neared, Obama suggested his health care reforms could be a step to the single-payer system:\n\n\u201cIf I were designing a system from scratch, I would probably go ahead with a single-payer system. \u2026 \u201c(But) people don\u2019t have time to wait. They need relief now. So my attitude is let\u2019s build up the system we got, let\u2019s make it more efficient, we may be over time \u2014 as we make the system more efficient and everybody\u2019s covered \u2014 decide that there are other ways for us to provide care more effectively.\u201d\n\nIn 2016, Colorado voters will have the chance to decide if they want to take that next step.", "article_metadata": {"p": {"domain_verify": "770b5b250556c52fa42a70dc373c541b"}, "description": "\"Hungry for something a little bit different\"...", "published_at": "2015-10-23T12:16:45+00:00", "author": "Kelsey Rupp", "og": {"site_name": "Independent Journal Review", "description": "\"Hungry for something a little bit different\"...", "title": "Colorado Voters in 2016 Will Have an Opportunity to Take Obamacare to Next Level", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 594, "identifier": "http://static.ijreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/GettyImages-108878994-2.jpg", "height": 396}, "url": "http://www.ijreview.com/2015/10/453195-colorado-obamacare-health-care-affordable-care-act-single-payer/", "type": "article"}, "is_article": 1, "twitter": {"description": "\"Hungry for something a little bit different\"...", "creator": "@injo", "image": "http://static.ijreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/GettyImages-108878994-2.jpg", "title": "Colorado Voters in 2016 Will Have an Opportunity to Take Obamacare to Next Level", "site": "@injo", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "post_id": 453195, "robots": "noodp", "DC.date.issued": "2015-10-23T12:16:45-04:00", "wp-categories": "14101 482 1471", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=878142436", "fb": {"admins": 1116123001, "app_id": 251714254848821}, "tags": "Politics", "url": "http://www.ijreview.com/2015/10/453195-colorado-obamacare-health-care-affordable-care-act-single-payer/", "wp-category-slugs": "editors-choice, nation, politics", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/injoreview/", "section": "Editor's Choice", "published_time": "2015-10-23T12:16:45-04:00"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "image": "http://static.ijreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/GettyImages-108878994-2.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "is_https": 0}, "article_summary": "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Unsatisfied with Obamacare, supporters of a single-payer health care system successfully collected enough signatures to put their preferred health care model on the 2016 ballot in the state of Colorado.\nTechnically, a single-payer health care system is one in which governments, rather than insurers, pay for all health care costs.\nProponents of the single-payer system, called ColoradoCare, say they have over the required 98,492 signatures needed to quality for the ballot.\nYears before winning the White House, President Obama was a vocal supporter of a single-payer health care system.\nIn 2003, the then-Illinois state Sen.
