That\u2019s why there\u2019s more the state should do right now to ensure Maine\u2019s solid waste picture changes for the better.\n\nThe state Legislature\u2019s Environment and Natural Resources Committee will meet Tuesday to decide on its next steps on legislation in the works that could make a number of solid waste-related policy changes.\n\nAs the committee decides its next steps, the operator of the state\u2019s largest landfill \u2014 Juniper Ridge in Old Town \u2014 is seeking Department of Environmental Protection approval to more than triple its capacity. A group representing more than 180 Maine towns and cities is seeking approval to build a new waste processing facility in Hampden. And the waste-to-energy facility those 180 towns currently use, the Penobscot Energy Recovery Corp. facility in Orrington, will fight to keep much of its existing business (i.e. trash to continue incinerating into electricity and landfill ash).\n\nWhat lawmakers should aim to do is ensure that any solid waste changes work toward the same goal \u2014 minimizing the amount of waste that finds its way into landfills.\n\nMaine law already has some components that can help the state accomplish that goal. One law makes it the state\u2019s goal to continue shrinking the waste stream by 5 percent every two years. Another sets a goal for the state to recycle at least half its waste. A third law requires that the Department of Environmental Protection ensure any new waste facility \u2014 be it a new or expanded landfill or a processing plant that converts trash into fuel or electricity \u2014 follows the principles of the state\u2019s waste management hierarchy, which emphasizes waste reduction, recycling, composting, incineration and other measures before landfilling.\n\nTo be sure, the state and individual Maine communities are making progress on the waste reduction front. The amount of solid waste that ended up at an incinerator or landfill dropped 9.8 percent between 2008 and 2013, according to the Maine DEP. And Maine produces less trash per capita than any other New England state. In 2014, when the DEP took steps to reject a proposal for a new landfill in the Argyle and Greenbush area in Penobscot County, the agency said the landfill proposal was inconsistent with the state\u2019s waste management hierarchy.\n\nBut there are other fronts on which progress is sorely needed.\n\nMaine\u2019s recycling rate has barely budged in two decades. The DEP calculated Maine\u2019s recycling rate for 2013 to be 41 percent, scarcely changed from 1997, when the rate was 42 percent. And much of Maine\u2019s solid waste doesn\u2019t need to end up as trash: A 2011 University of Maine analysis showed that 60 percent of household waste could be either composted (40 percent) or recycled (20 percent), meaning much of Maine\u2019s waste that ends up incinerated or in a landfill doesn\u2019t have to end up there.\n\nLawmakers on Tuesday will consider at least two measures that could make a difference. A bill they\u2019re considering would require that commercial food waste be composted, emulating a similar measure that took effect in Massachusetts last year. The legislation also would set up a grant and loan fund to pay for initiatives that boost composting and recycling. The right funding source? Finally ending the state\u2019s policy of allowing towns and cities to send their waste straight to a landfill for free.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not following through on incentivizing the behavior that we want,\u201d said Rep. Robert Duchesne, D-Hudson, an Environment and Natural Resources Committee member.\n\nNow, though, policymakers have a chance to ensure Maine\u2019s solid waste laws actually help the state follow through on its waste reduction goals.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\u201cA handful of changes in the works for Maine\u2019s solid waste landscape could greatly expand the state\u2019s landfill capacity and change what becomes of a significant portion of waste once it leaves the curbside.\u201d Maine news, sports, politics and election results, and obituaries from the Bangor Daily News.", "generator": "WordPress 4.1.5", "og": {"site_name": "The Bangor Daily News", "description": "\u201cA handful of changes in the works for Maine\u2019s solid waste landscape could greatly expand the state\u2019s landfill capacity and change what becomes of a significant portion of waste once it leaves the curbside.\u201d", "title": "Maine\u2019s laws should help state meet its waste reduction goals", "url": "http://bangordailynews.com/2015/11/21/opinion/editorials/maines-laws-should-help-state-meet-its-waste-reduction-goals/", "image": "http://static.bangordailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/10059341_H5330168-600x402.jpg?strip=all", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\u201cA handful of changes in the works for Maine\u2019s solid waste landscape could greatly expand the state\u2019s landfill capacity and change what becomes of a significant portion of waste once it leaves the curbside.\u201d", "title": "Maine\u2019s laws should help state meet its waste reduction goals", "url": "http://bangordailynews.com/2015/11/21/opinion/editorials/maines-laws-should-help-state-meet-its-waste-reduction-goals/", "image": "http://static.bangordailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/10059341_H5330168-250x250.jpg?strip=all", "site": "@bangordailynews", "card": "summary"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.7", "fb": {"app_id": 748756371893770}, "keywords": "Maine, news, elections, election results, politics, sports, Bangor, Portland, Augusta, weather, obituaries, Waterville, Aroostook, Penobscot, Piscataquis, Somerset, Hancock, Washington, bdn,editorials,opinion,state,maine\u2019s laws should help state meet its waste reduction goals,is_article,the bdn editorial board", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd20bd\"", "article_summary": "Now, though, policymakers have a chance to ensure Maine\u2019s solid waste laws actually help the state follow through on its waste reduction goals.\nThat\u2019s why there\u2019s more the state should do right now to ensure Maine\u2019s solid waste picture changes for the better.\nThe DEP calculated Maine\u2019s recycling rate for 2013 to be 41 percent, scarcely changed from 1997, when the rate was 42 percent.\nOne law makes it the state\u2019s goal to continue shrinking the waste stream by 5 percent every two years.\nA handful of changes in the works for Maine\u2019s solid waste landscape could greatly expand the state\u2019s landfill capacity and change what becomes of a significant portion of waste once it leaves the curbside."}
