To close the gap, the county has put about 700 positions on the chopping block and has proposed less generous employee healthcare plans.\n\nFurther complicating matters, a series of collective bargaining agreements between Miami-Dade and unions representing county employees expire Sept. 30, the day before the fiscal year sets in. That means that some benefits for county employees represented by unions will be reinstated, further increasing costs to the county. Miami-Dade is negotiating with the unions.\n\nThe committee, appointed by Mayor Carlos Gimenez, gave stakeholders such as labor unions and county officials a platform to propose changes to the healthcare structure. The ultimate goal: save on employee healthcare costs.\n\nFor 2014, the county\u2019s healthcare cost is projected at $424 million. That\u2019s set to increase in 2015 to $455 million if the current healthcare structure remains in place, according to the committee\u2019s report released last week.\n\nAlso, the group explored ways to lower premiums for dependents as stakeholders expressed concern with the high dependent premiums during committee meetings.\n\nThe committee made 14 recommendations to help adjust the healthcare structure and lower costs.\n\nAnother suggestion is to require AvMed, Miami-Dade\u2019s healthcare program administrator, to negotiate further discounts with existing providers.\n\nAbout 62% of employees who are insured through the county have employee-only coverage.\n\nIn addition to the budget challenges for next fiscal year, Miami-Dade is also faced with complying with provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. As a result of some of the federal law\u2019s provisions, the county has already incurred additional costs, according to the Labor Healthcare Committee\u2019s report.\n\nFor one, in 2018, the county might owe about $26 million in a Cadillac Tax, or an excise tax, if the aggregate value of the county\u2019s health insurance coverage for an employee exceeds the Affordable Care Act\u2019s threshold amount, based on county records.\n\nThe Labor Healthcare Committee was comprised of Commissioner Jean Monestime, Deputy Mayor Russell Benford and Andy Madtes, an administrator with the Local 199 of the American Federal of State, County, and Municipal Employees.\n\nA date for the commission to consider the Labor Healthcare Committee\u2019s recommendations has yet to be set. Miami-Dade commissioners are scheduled to give their final vote on next fiscal year\u2019s budget Sept. 11.", "article_metadata": {"description": "County plan: send every employee to Jackson by at MiamiTodayNews.com.", "generator": "EventON 2.3.18", "og": {"site_name": "Miami Today", "description": "County plan: send every employee to Jackson by at MiamiTodayNews.com.", "title": "County plan: send every employee to Jackson", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://mt1.miamitoday.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Unknown-6-300x199.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-08-06T10:48:05+00:00", "url": "http://www.miamitodaynews.com/2014/08/06/county-plan-send-every-employee-jackson/", "type": "article"}, "robots": "noodp", "article": {"section": "Healthcare", "published_time": "2014-08-06T10:00:56+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-06T10:48:05+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0d29\"", "article_summary": "That means that some benefits for county employees represented by unions will be reinstated, further increasing costs to the county.\nA date for the commission to consider the Labor Healthcare Committee\u2019s recommendations has yet to be set.\nCounty plan: send every employee to JacksonWritten by Lidia Dinkova on August 6, 2014A committee that probed how Miami-Dade could save money on health costs for its employees has suggested that publicly funded Jackson Health System become the sole non-emergency healthcare provider to Miami-Dade and Jackson employees.\nAs a result of some of the federal law\u2019s provisions, the county has already incurred additional costs, according to the Labor Healthcare Committee\u2019s report.\nTo close the gap, the county has put about 700 positions on the chopping block and has proposed less generous employee healthcare plans."}
