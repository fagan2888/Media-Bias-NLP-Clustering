It\u2019s similar to an approach President Obama used when he urged Americans to help Syrian refugees with donations made through crowdfunding sites Kickstarter and Instacart. When the first lady called on the private sector to help employ veterans and end homelessness, Uber and Lyft donated free rides to tens of thousands of Americans who needed help getting to job interviews.\n\nZocDoc Chief Executive Oliver Kharraz said his company will contact customers who have paid out-of-pocket for health care services to urge them to sign up for coverage through Healthcare.gov.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all in the name of removing barriers to get access to care, which is really what we are all about,\u201d said Kharraz.\n\nOscar Health, a company that uses technology to guide people to better care, is distributing a video that explains how the Affordable Care Act (also dubbed Obamacare) works.\n\n\u201cWe sell in this market created by the ACA,\u201d said Mario Schlosser, Oscar Health chief executive and co-founder. \u201cSo we\u2019ve got to explain to you why you should buy insurance. We always have to do a lot of education.\u201d\n\nThe government is also getting an assist from startups that aren\u2019t working in health care or insurance, in addition to the expected celebrity promos from figures like Magic Johnson (though with not quite the same gusto as when the site launched a couple years ago). The Shade Room, a social media-based celebrity gossip mag launched in 2014, reminded its 2.4 million Instagram followers with a post about the Dec. 15 enrollment deadline.\n\nThe Shade Room, which the New York Times Magazine called \u201cInstagram\u2019s TMZ\u201d earlier this year, is run by Angie, a woman in her mid-20s who prefers to go by her first name only. She said that the post \u201cwasn\u2019t a plug at all.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I found out the deadline was approaching this year, I just posted it because I wanted our readers to know about it,\u201d Angie told Re/code in a phone interview. \u201cI missed the deadline the first time around, and didn\u2019t have health care because I didn\u2019t have much money. I got sick a couple of times and went to the hospital, and had a lot of bills. This was during the time when the Shade Room wasn\u2019t making any money yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cI need to let those people out there who have had the same experience know about it,\u201d she added. \u201cThose things can happen.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#ed2b23", "description": "The HealthCare.gov enrollment deadline is Dec. 15.", "author": "Dawn Chmielewski", "og": {"site_name": "Recode", "description": "The HealthCare.gov enrollment deadline is Dec. 15.", "title": "Health Care Companies Join White House in Urging Americans to #GetCovered", "url": "http://www.recode.net/2015/12/8/11621254/health-care-companies-join-white-house-in-urging-americans-to", "image": "https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uw6WVP75OTBSayPd6gPmldRFLxk=/0x143:2746x1688/1600x900/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/49580025/get-coverage-screen-closeup.0.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The HealthCare.gov enrollment deadline is Dec. 15.", "title": "Health Care Companies Join White House in Urging Americans to #GetCovered", "url": "http://www.recode.net/2015/12/8/11621254/health-care-companies-join-white-house-in-urging-americans-to", "image": {"src": "https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uw6WVP75OTBSayPd6gPmldRFLxk=/0x143:2746x1688/1600x900/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/49580025/get-coverage-screen-closeup.0.jpg"}, "site": "Recode", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-12-08", "sailthru.title": "Health Care Companies Join White House in Urging Americans to #GetCovered", "fb": {"app_id": 186672874861631}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6397045/recode_favicon-144.0.png", "google-site-verification": "hjxK0n4cwDZzIl6phvogE8im4UEcc5HKC14Tl5HI-Jk", "sailthru.tags": "general,recode", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-08T11:00:45Z"}, "style-tools": "/style/d75fd5fb90a12660fd6c67badbca975d/tools.css", "sailthru.description": "The HealthCare.gov enrollment deadline is Dec. 15.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no"}, "article_summary": "\u201cTraditionally what we\u2019ve done is use White House channels, like WhiteHouse.gov or the Facebook page, to talk about the administration\u2019s priorities,\u201d said White House Chief Digital Officer Jason Goldman, a longtime tech industry executive.\n\u201cI missed the deadline the first time around, and didn\u2019t have health care because I didn\u2019t have much money.\nTwo health care companies have taken up the White House\u2019s challenge of encouraging millions of uninsured Americans to get coverage during the open enrollment period.\nThis time out, the White House enlisted the help of the private sector in putting out the word about the health care options offered through the Healthcare.gov marketplace.\nZocDoc Chief Executive Oliver Kharraz said his company will contact customers who have paid out-of-pocket for health care services to urge them to sign up for coverage through Healthcare.gov."}
