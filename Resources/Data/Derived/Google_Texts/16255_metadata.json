He is also part of the group promoting the opening of an Arizona office in Mexico City to foster business and investment.\u201d\n\nNowakowski accepted the award from the from the Mexican Consulate at City Hall during a ceremony on Sept. 15 with more than 400 people in attendance, including the Council General of Mexico, Mayor Greg Stanton and business and community leaders.\n\n\u201cI think that I\u2019m able to sit down and look at what brings people together,\u201d Nowakowski said. \u201cWhat separates us a lot of times is the color of our skin and the language that we speak. If you can bring people together to talk about what they have in common, you start talking about common grounds.\u201d\n\nDistrict 7 encompasses an area of Phoenix where, according to the United States Census, 40.8 percent of the population is Hispanic or Latino.\n\nNowakowski is the vice president of communications of Radio Campesina, a network of 10 nonprofit Spanish-language radio stations, and also serves as executive vice president of the Cesar Chavez Foundation Communication Fund.\n\nAs vice president, Nowakowski oversees nine radio stations that the foundation owns. Phoenix has the number one radio station, reaching more than 180,000 people.\n\nWhen Arizona was in the process of passing Senate Bill 1070, the radio station was a way for people to communicate. Nowakowski said that the stations were used to tell people what their rights are, the importance of voting, and the importance of getting involved.\n\n\u201cWe got the message out there,\u201d Nowakowski said. \u201cWe educated people, we organized people. I think that\u2019s one of the tools that Cesar Chavez talked about was that a radio station isn\u2019t just a radio station. It\u2019s a community center on cyberspace. We\u2019ve taken that to the fullest.\u201d\n\nRuben Gallego, a current candidate for Congressional District 7, was once Nowakowski\u2019s campaign manager and then his chief of staff. He said that as issues pop up, the radio station is used to communicate with a lot of people who otherwise wouldn\u2019t hear the news.\n\n\u201cMany (Latinos) that don\u2019t have access to the Internet, or who don\u2019t have time to sit down and read the newspaper, this is the only time they get their news, when they\u2019re driving to work,\u201d Gallego said.\n\nDuring a lot of the SB1070 fights, Nowakowski organized marches of thousands of people to protest against the bill, Gallego said. He used the radio station to explain to people their rights as citizens and immigrants in the country.\n\n\u201cWhen health care enrollment was happening with the Affordable Care Act, he was able to use the radio station to explain to people about the act and encourage them to sign up, something that was very important to the Latino community,\u201d Gallego said.\n\nNowakowski said the biggest issue he has noticed with the Latino community is obtaining a good-paying job.\n\n\u201cDuring those hard times, I was able to continue the relationship with Mexico by attracting businesses to Arizona despite the social conditions,\u201d Nowakowski said.\n\nHe also emphasized the importance of education and the value that many Latino families place on it. He said he has been a prominent advocate for the DREAM Act and, through his position with the Cesar Chavez Foundation, has ensured secure scholarship funding for DREAM Act students.\n\n\u201c(Latino families) want to have the best education for their kids,\u201d Nowakowski said. \u201cThey want to make sure that their kids are going to be able to go to school to begin with.\u201d\n\nIn the last five years, the Cesar Chavez Foundation has helped provide $100,000 in funding for in-state university and community college students, Nowakowski said.\n\nNowakowski comes from a bicultural family, with his father being Polish and his mother born in Mexico. His background helps him connect to the Latino community, he said.\n\n\u201cYou get to see that there\u2019s so many things in common with the Polish community and the Mexican community,\u201d Nowakowski said. \u201cThe same struggles that the Polish community had back in the early 40s are the same struggles that the Mexican community is having now.\u201d\n\nGallego said that Nowakowski is a key leader to help those struggles by getting resources to the Latino community. He added that people can call and talk to Nowakowski whenever they need to.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the only city councilman that even speaks Spanish, so he really is the council member for the Spanish-speaking community in all of Phoenix, not just his city council district,\u201d Gallego said.\n\nContact the reporter at Rebecca.Brisley@asu.edu", "article_metadata": {"generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "author": "Becky Brisley", "og": {"site_name": "Downtown Devil", "description": "Phoenix Councilman Michael Nowakowski, who represents District 7, was awarded with the Ohtli Award in mid-September.
