It produces several hormones that are important to bodily functions - especially metabolism and growth.\n\nThyroid surgery is required if the gland develops abnormal growths, becomes cancerous or is not functioning correctly. The thyroid or just part of it may be removed during surgery.\n\nSomewhere between 120,000 and 166,000 thyroid surgeries are performed in the U.S. each year, the authors note in the journal JAMA Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery.\n\nFor the new study, they used data collected from 62,722 people who were having thyroid surgery between 2003 and 2009.\n\nMost of the surgeries involved complete removal of the gland for non-cancerous conditions. About 91 percent of the surgeries were done by surgeons who performed fewer than 100 thyroid surgeries per year, which the authors considered a \u201clow volume.\u201d\n\nThe researchers found that about 17 percent of patients whose procedures were done by a low-volume surgeon had complications, compared to about 12 percent of patients with high-volume surgeons.\n\nComplications were also more common among patients who had their surgeries at hospitals that didn\u2019t handle many thyroid surgeries. About 18 percent of patients at hospitals with fewer than 48 thyroid surgeries per year had complications, compared to about 15 percent among patients at higher-volume hospitals.\n\nPatients of low-volume surgeons or low-volume hospitals were also more likely to stay in the hospital longer than the patients of high-volume doctors or hospitals.\n\nThe researchers found that compared with white patients, Hispanics were about twice as likely to be operated on by low-volume surgeons, as were black patients living in the Northeast. Black patients were also more likely to go to a low-volume hospital in the Midwest and West.\n\nIn addition, low-income patients or those on Medicare, the federal insurance for the elderly and disabled, were more likely to have their operation at a low-volume hospital.\n\nHauch said one reason minorities and people with low incomes may be more likely to see low-volume surgeons or go to low-volume hospitals is access to insurance.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t have insurance there are certain hospitals that won\u2019t see the patients,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the driving force behind Obamacare (the 2010 Affordable Care Act). It\u2019s to try to deliver care to everyone.\u201d\n\nThe researchers can\u2019t be sure that lack of insurance is the reason for the differences in access to high-volume surgeons, Hauch cautioned. \u201cWhat we found was just the association between certain minorities and their access to those higher volume institutions,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that one approach to addressing the differences in outcomes could be to go into the community and have interest groups establish more clinics to reach people who have limited access to healthcare.\n\nAs an example, he noted that transplant surgeons in New Orleans have reached out to communities to help educate people about conditions related to transplants and encouraged them to get checked out in clinics.\n\n\u201cGetting higher volume surgeons and hospitals to those patients is the best thing you can garner from all this,\u201d he said.\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/1wfHeGo JAMA Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery, online September 4, 2014.", "article_metadata": {"DCSext.ContentID_healthNews": "USKBN0H52BB20140910", "sailthru.author": "Andrew  M.
