Petitioner argued that the declarations provide additional evidence in support of the grounds that were instituted (as to claims 7-11), as well as the non-instituted grounds (as to claims 1-6 and 12) that were the subject of a request for rehearing.\n\nThe Board first addressed Petitioner\u2019s argument regarding the non-instituted claims 1-6 and 12. The Board had already denied Petitioner\u2019s Request for Rehearing of the denial to institute a proceeding with respect to those claims. Therefore, the Board found the proposed supplemental information to be irrelevant with respect to those claims.\n\nTurning to Petitioner\u2019s argument regarding claims 7-11, the Board found the supplemental information to be relevant to a claim for which trial had been instituted, satisfying the criteria for filing a motion to submit supplemental information under 37 CFR \u00a7 42.123(a). However, meeting the criteria for filing the motion does not mean the motion should be granted. The Board stated that previous motions had been granted in situations where the supplemental information \u201cdid not change the grounds of unpatentability authorized in the proceeding, and did not change the evidence initially presented in the petition to support those grounds.\u201d However, motions that \u201csought to use the supplemental information at issue to bolster the challenges presented originally in the Petition, based on feedback gleaned from the institution decision\u201d had been denied by the Board. Changing the evidence that was originally presented in the petition does not comport with \u201cthe statutory requirement that a petition must identify, with particularity, the evidence supporting the challenge to each claim.\u201d\n\nIn this case, the Board agreed with Patent Owner, and Petitioner had conceded, that the supplemental information was intended to \u201cbolster the evidence originally submitted in support of the Petition.\u201d Therefore, the Board denied Petitioner\u2019s Motion.\n\nMitsubishi Plastics, Inc. v.
