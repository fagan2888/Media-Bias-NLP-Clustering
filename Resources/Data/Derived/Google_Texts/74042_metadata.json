Gunshots, many dead. A tall, bald man leading a murderous group of white men, presumably drug traffickers. Survivors escaping into the jungle while elders and children were slaughtered. The days following the massacre were marked by profound sadness and mourning; the dead were buried in mass graves. A hasty evacuation meant they were short of food and supplies. They decided to pursue a final, desperate resort: to seek out settled indigenous villages along the adjacent Rio Envira and beg for food and mercy.\n\nSeven survivors made their way to the Ashaninka community of Simpatia (\u201cSympathy\u201d) to ask for food, but since they spoke no common language the encounter was tense. Not until two Yaminawa interpreters were brought was communication finally established. The language they speak is a dialect of Yaminawa so communication has been extremely fluent. It was already suspected, based on their location and body adornments, that they belonged to an isolated Panoan group. The Yaminawa interpreters confirmed their linguistic affiliation and suggest they are closely related to the Chitonahua of Peru (rendered as \u2018Xitonawa\u2019 in the Brazilian orthography), however they call themselves \u201cXatanawa,\u201d which means, \u201cMacaw-Tribe.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Forced to relocate from their village in Peru\u2019s Amazon, a recently uncontacted tribe made contact with another tribe in Brazil out of desperation.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/08/04/murderous-drug-traffickers-force-isolated-group-amazon-make-contact-156215", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/uncontacted_indians_appeared_young_and_healthy_-_courtesy_funai.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Murderous Drug Traffickers Force Isolated Group in Amazon to Make Contact"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dc": {"title": "Murderous Drug Traffickers Force Isolated Group in Amazon to Make Contact"}, "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/08/04/murderous-drug-traffickers-force-isolated-group-amazon-make-contact-156215", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.creator": "kpolisse", "dcterms.date": "2014-08-04T14:08-04:00", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Peruvian President Fernando Belaunde, Fernando Belaunde, Chitonahua of Peru, Yaminawa, Minuya River, Peruvian Loggers, Yora, Nahua, Manu National Park, Shell Oil, Brazil\u2019s National Indian Foundation, FUNAI, Rubber Boom, Glenn Shepard, Felipe Martinez, Uncontacted Peoples, Indigenous Peoples, Isolated Groups, FENAMAD, Peru-Brazil Border, Ashaninka Community of Simpatia, Isolated Panoan Groups, Disease, Malaria, Illegal Logging, Drug Trafficking", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 1}, "dcterms.title": "Murderous Drug Traffickers Force Isolated Group in Amazon to Make Contact"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb500\"", "article_summary": "A tall, bald man leading a murderous group of white men, presumably drug traffickers.\nIt was already suspected, based on their location and body adornments, that they belonged to an isolated Panoan group.\nThe Yaminawa interpreters confirmed their linguistic affiliation and suggest they are closely related to the Chitonahua of Peru (rendered as \u2018Xitonawa\u2019 in the Brazilian orthography), however they call themselves \u201cXatanawa,\u201d which means, \u201cMacaw-Tribe.\u201d\nNot until two Yaminawa interpreters were brought was communication finally established.\nThe language they speak is a dialect of Yaminawa so communication has been extremely fluent."}
