I think so many people have gotten joy from the garden and solace.\u201d\n\nBoston Children\u2019s Hospital spokesman Rob Graham issued a statement saying the planned clinical building is \u201cessential to meeting the needs\u201d of the hospital\u2019s patients and families, it has the support of the Prouty Garden donor\u2019s family members and foundation, and it\u2019s been subject to public approvals since 2012.\n\nThe planned building will feature a new state-of-the-art neonatal intensive care unit and will allow the hospital to offer all private patient rooms, thereby eliminating double-bedded rooms, according to administrators.\n\n\u201cBoston Children\u2019s has great appreciation for what the Prouty Garden offers patients, families and our staff,\u201d the hospital statement reads. \u201cThat is why our clinical expansion will focus on open and green spaces to support healing for everyone throughout our campus, year round.\u201d\n\nHospital officials say the facility will ultimately have 25 percent more \u201cgreen space\u201d than it has now.\n\nDr. John Mulliken is a pediatric plastic surgeon, director of the Craniofacial Center and co-director of the Vascular Anomalies Center at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital. He also signed the petition.\n\n\u201cUntil I see a hole in the ground we still have a chance to save the Prouty Garden. It\u2019s the soul of the hospital. It\u2019s the sanctuary that we all need \u2014 particularly the kids, but the parents and the staff, as well, \u201d Mulliken says. \u201cI\u2019ve always been proud to work at Children\u2019s Hospital for the last 40 years. But now I really question what they\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\nHospital administrators say construction on the new building will start next year.\n\nEarlier:", "article_metadata": {"description": "The doctors, nurses and nurse practitioners who signed the petition say they've been left out of the hospital's decision to construct an 11-story clinical building on the site of the garden.", "og": {"site_name": "commonhealth", "description": "The doctors, nurses and nurse practitioners who signed the petition say they've been left out of the hospital's decision to construct an 11-story clinical building on the site of the garden.", "title": "Clinicians Petition Boston Children\u2019s Hospital To Preserve Prouty Garden", "url": "http://commonhealth.wbur.org/2015/11/clinicians-petition-boston-childrens-hospital-prouty-garden", "image": "http://s3.amazonaws.com/media.wbur.org/wordpress/15/files/2015/04/proutyredwood-620x413.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://commonhealth.wbur.org/2015/11/clinicians-petition-boston-childrens-hospital-prouty-garden", "image": "//s3.amazonaws.com/media.wbur.org/wordpress/15/files/2015/04/proutyredwood-620x413.jpg", "site": "@commonhealth", "card": "summary", "title": "Clinicians Petition Boston Children's Hospital To Preserve Prouty Garden"}, "DC.date.issued": "2015-11-17", "msvalidate.01": "D02D46BAEDB3F81FC1B1DE2A8CB69551", "fb": {"admins": 1549080028, "app_id": 134067973330252}, "date": "Tue, 17 Nov 2015 18:42:33 -0500"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe5e7f\"", "article_summary": "Clinicians Petition Boston Children\u2019s Hospital To Preserve Prouty GardenSeventy clinicians from Boston Children\u2019s Hospital have sent hospital administrators a petition imploring them to \u201creverse course\u201d on plans to demolish Prouty Garden, a healing garden that was gifted to the hospital 60 years ago.\n\u201cYou cannot replace [Prouty Garden] with indoor gardens or with the [outdoor] garden they\u2019re planning,\u201d Gellis told WBUR.\n\u201cBoston Children\u2019s has great appreciation for what the Prouty Garden offers patients, families and our staff,\u201d the hospital statement reads.\nDr. John Mulliken is a pediatric plastic surgeon, director of the Craniofacial Center and co-director of the Vascular Anomalies Center at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital.\nThe petition calls Prouty Garden a \u201cprecious asset,\u201d an \u201cenduring therapeutic resource\u201d and a testament to the hospital\u2019s commitment to compassionate care."}
