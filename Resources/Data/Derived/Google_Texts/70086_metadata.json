Instead, the administration abruptly postponed the launch after a federal judge in Texas temporarily blocked the White House initiative.\n\nIn a decision late Monday, U.S. District Judge Andrew S. Hanen ruled that the deferred-deportation program should not move forward while a lawsuit filed by 26 states challenging it was being decided. Though Hanen did not rule on the constitutionality of Obama\u2019s November immigration order, he said there was sufficient merit to warrant a suspension of the new program while the case goes forward. All told, Obama\u2019s immigration actions are projected to benefit as many as 5 million immigrants, many of whom could receive work permits if they qualified.\n\nThe effects of Hanen\u2019s procedural ruling rippled through Washington and underscored a broader challenge to the president as he seeks to solidify the legacy of his administration.\n\nAlong with the immigration action, the fate of two of Obama\u2019s other signature initiatives \u2014 a landmark health-care law and a series of aggressive executive actions on climate change \u2014 now rests in the hands of federal judges. It is a daunting prospect for a president in the final two years of his tenure who believes he is on the path to leaving a lasting impact on in\u00adtrac\u00adtable and politically perilous issues, despite an often bitter relationship with Congress.\n\nNow, Obama and his Republican antagonists in Congress face the uncertainty of having their disputes mediated by the third branch of government. In an appearance in the Oval Office on Tuesday, Obama said he was confident that he would prevail, telling reporters, \u201cThe law is on our side and history is on our side.\u201d\n\nPresident Obama says he disagrees with a Texas judge's ruling delaying his executive action on immigration. (Reuters)\n\n\u201cThis is not the first time where a lower-court judge has blocked something or attempted to block something that ultimately is going to be lawful,\u201d he added, \u201cand I\u2019m confident that it is well within my authority\u201d to execute this policy.\n\nThe immigration fight will probably head next to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit after the White House vowed to quickly appeal Hanen\u2019s ruling. In the meantime, Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said Tuesday that his agency would postpone plans to begin accepting applications for the new program, which would expand a 2012 program that defers deportations of immigrants who came to the United States illegally as children. (The 700,000 people who have already benefited from that program will not be affected by Hanen\u2019s ruling.)\n\nA second, much larger program designed to protect from deportation the undocumented parents of U.S. citizens and permanent legal residents was not scheduled to begin accepting applications until late May, and its future remains uncertain.\n\nOn health care, the Supreme Court will hear arguments next month in King v. Burwell, a case that calls into question whether millions of people who have bought coverage on the federal health exchanges are entitled to subsidies.\n\nIn April, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, just one rung below the Supreme Court, will hear three consolidated cases challenging the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s right to use a provision of the Clean Air Act to regulate greenhouse-gas emissions from power plants.\n\n\u201cThe Supreme Court\u2019s docket in recent terms looks a lot like an outline for a stump speech for a 2016 [presidential] candidate. Immigration, check. Climate, check. Health care, check,\u201d Doug Kendall, president of the Constitutional Accountability Center, said in an e-mail. \u201cThe court is deciding just about every major question that divides Americans along ideological lines.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the ongoing immigration suit from the 26 states \u2014 24 of which are led by GOP governors \u2014 House Republicans are considering filing their own suit against the administration over its immigration actions.\n\nPresident Obama announced new action to delay the deportation of about 4 million undocumented immigrants living in the U.S. Here are some numbers to know about immigration. (Julie Percha/The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cI guess we\u2019re getting used to getting sued,\u201d White House senior counselor John D. Podesta quipped in an interview last week, just before he stepped down from his West Wing role.\n\nThe pending case over the Affordable Care Act \u2014 passed in 2010 \u2014 shows how in the never-ending political fight between the parties, even the passage of major legislation through Congress does not constitute a permanent victory, said Jonathan Oberlander, a professor of health policy at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really incredible they attained the unattainable, and now the question is whether they can keep it,\u201d Oberlander said of Democrats.\n\nOne senior Senate Democratic aide, who asked for anonymity in order to discuss party strategy, said one reason Senate leaders pushed so hard in the last Congress to seat Obama\u2019s nominees on the D.C. Circuit was that \u201chaving judges who may be more sympathetic to the administration\u2019s view is not an insignificant way of safeguarding against\u201d legal reversals.\n\nHanen, a George W. Bush appointee, has been critical of Obama\u2019s immigration policies in other cases.\n\nIn the last Congress, the Senate confirmed four of Obama\u2019s nominees to the D.C. Circuit, which hears many challenges to executive actions. Active Democratic appointees now outnumber Republican ones there 7 to 4.\n\nJeffrey R. Holmstead, a partner at the law firm Bracewell & Giuliani who represents several electric utilities, said Democrats should not be so confident, especially since the more conservative Supreme Court will have the final say in many of these cases.\n\nOn immigration, Democrats and Republicans scrambled Tuesday to determine how Hanen\u2019s ruling would affect a showdown over GOP demands to make funding for the Department of Homeland Security, which expires next week, contingent on halting Obama\u2019s \u201cdeferred action\u201d program. The White House has threatened to veto any legislation if it contains language overturning the president\u2019s immigration programs. Such a veto could lead to a partial DHS shutdown.\n\nRELATED: What we know and don\u2019t know about the fight over DHS funding\n\nObama issued his immigration orders shortly after the midterm elections in November, saying he could no longer wait on Congress to reform border-control laws that have left more than 11 million illegal immigrants in limbo. An effort to pass a comprehensive immigration bill failed last summer.\n\nBut in his lengthy memorandum opinion, Hanen ruled that no law gave the administration the power \u201cto give 4.3 million removable aliens what the Department of Homeland Security itself labels as \u2018legal presence.\u2019 In fact, the law mandates that these illegally-present individuals be removed.\u201d\n\nHanen\u2019s decision was a major, if temporary, defeat for the administration, which argued that the case should be thrown out because it is \u201cbased on rhetoric, not law.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis ruling underscores what the president has already acknowledged publicly 22 times: He doesn\u2019t have the authority to take the kinds of actions he once referred to as \u2018ignoring the law\u2019 and \u2018unwise and unfair,\u2019 \u201d Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said Tuesday.\n\nThe White House has said the president\u2019s actions were based on the practice of \u201cprosecutorial discretion,\u201d which allows law enforcement agencies with limited resources to set priorities.\n\n\u201cThe Supreme Court and Congress have made clear that the federal government can set priorities in enforcing our immigration laws \u2014 which is exactly what the president did,\u201d White House press secretary Josh Earnest said.\n\nHanen based his temporary injunction on his belief that the administration, in making such a broad change to what current law \u201cmandates,\u201d at the very least did not comply with the elaborate rulemaking process of the Administrative Procedure Act, the nearly 70-year-old stature that governs how federal agencies implement regulations \u2014 including its 90-day notices and comment periods.\n\nHe said the case should go forward rather than be thrown out, as the administration has urged.\n\nImmigration advocates charged that Hanen had narrowly \u201ccherry-picked\u201d his ruling and said they would urge immigrants to keep preparing their applications.\n\n\u201cOur message to our members and to families who are preparing for deferred action is: Don\u2019t panic. Keep preparing,\u201d said Debbie Smith, associate general counsel of the Service Employees International Union, which filed a legal brief in support of the administration. \u201cWe think this is a timeout, a bump in the road.\u201d\n\nIf opponents of the president\u2019s health-care, climate and immigration policies prevail in court, it is unclear what Republicans would propose as replacements. Three House panels have just begun working on alternatives to the Affordable Care Act, but Republicans remain opposed to mandatory limits on carbon from power plants and have yet to draft a comprehensive immigration bill of their own.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re tearing stuff down without trying to offer any alternative if this thing crashes,\u201d said Simon Rosenberg, founder of NDN, a liberal think tank. The administration, he added, is \u201cconfident the laws are behind them, but they are aware this is out of their hands. We don\u2019t know what will happen.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a level of chaos that could affect the health-care system and the entire functioning of DHS,\u201d Rosenberg said. \u201c[Republicans] are not taking responsibility for the chaos they\u2019re creating. If they win, what are they going to do?\u201d\n\nFred Barbash contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The move delayed the president\u2019s executive actions and puts another of his signature initiatives in the courts\u2019 hands.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/eilperin", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The move delayed the president\u2019s executive actions and puts another of his signature initiatives in the courts\u2019 hands.", "title": "Judge\u2019s immigration ruling adds to Obama\u2019s list of potential legal pitfalls", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/federal-judge-in-texas-deals-legal-blow-to-obamas-immigration-action/2015/02/17/a93cb456-b6b8-11e4-aa05-1ce812b3fdd2_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/02/17/Editorial-Opinion/Images/Immigration_Waiting_Game-09241.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@eilperin"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/federal-judge-in-texas-deals-legal-blow-to-obamas-immigration-action/2015/02/17/a93cb456-b6b8-11e4-aa05-1ce812b3fdd2_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "obama, immigration, texas judge, Andrew Hanen, DHS, illegal immigration, immigration reform, undocumented immigrants, illegal immigrants, daca", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/eilperin"}, "eomportal-uuid": "a93cb456-b6b8-11e4-aa05-1ce812b3fdd2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "obama, immigration, texas judge, Andrew Hanen, DHS, illegal immigration, immigration reform, undocumented immigrants, illegal immigrants, daca"}, "article_summary": "All told, Obama\u2019s immigration actions are projected to benefit as many as 5 million immigrants, many of whom could receive work permits if they qualified.\nHanen, a George W.
