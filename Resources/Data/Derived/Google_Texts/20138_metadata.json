If there are any barriers with literacy or language comprehension, the patient is guided through that process.\u201d\n\nThe Health Project also helps people connect with Michigan Pathways to Better Health, a home-visits program for patients with two or more chronic diseases who are Medicaid or Medicare recipients.\n\nStaffing\n\nShelby is in the center of an extensive agricultural region that stretches over most of western Oceana County, which draws thousands of Spanish speaking migrant farm workers every year.\n\nTwo full-time staff work at the new Shelby Health Project office, and one is fluent in Spanish and English.\n\nThe office plans to add two additional full-time community health workers by the year end, Riel said.\n\nAffordable Care Act\n\n\u201cWe anticipate we are going to be doing a lot of enrollment into health coverage come October 1,\u201d Riel said, referring to the start date of the health insurance exchanges that are being set up under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nHowever, Riel said the Health Project is not driven by the ACA, noting that the Health Project began in 1995.\n\nRiel added that all nonprofit hospitals in Michigan have a legal obligation to provide \u201ccommunity benefit\u201d wherever they operate, and the Health Project is one way Mercy Health achieves that goal.\n\n\u201cWe are thrilled to support the opening of this Health Project office in Oceana County,\u201d said Jay Bryan, president/CEO of Mercy Health Lakeshore Campus. \u201cThe team provides comprehensive enrollment services for multiple programs and services currently available and helps us prepare for the opportunities found under health care reform.\u201d\n\nMercy Health serves West Michigan and the lakeshore with five hospital campuses, including Saint Mary\u2019s in Grand Rapids. Its facilities have a total of 800 hospital beds, 58 physician offices, more than 1,300 medical staff physicians and 7,200 other employees. It also provides hospice, home health care and long-term care services.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Mercy Health\u2019s Lakeshore Campus hospital will officially unveil its new social services office this Friday.
