This follows the decision by President Obama to allow individuals to keep their existing 2013 insurance plans in 2014 even if the plans do not meet ACA requirements.\n\nHMSA and Kaiser Hawaii will continue 2013 individual plans, the division said in a statement Tuesday.\n\nAll five insurers (HMSA, Kaiser, Hawaii Medical Assurance Association, University Health Alliance, and Family Health Hawaii) will also be offering ACA plans for small businesses, subject to the Insurance Division\u2019s approval. HMSA and Kaiser will continue to offer their non-ACA-compliant 2013 plans for individuals.\n\n\u201cUsing that premium sheet, consumers and small businesses can compare their ACA plan premiums to the premiums for their existing 2013 plans plus add an increase to their 2013 plans of about 8 percent to 10 percent,\u201d Ito said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nObamacare-compliant plans can be purchased through the Hawaii Health Connector or directly from an insurer. However, the state is reminding consumers and small businesses that only ACA-compliant plans purchased through the Hawaii Health Connector will be eligible for tax credits.\n\nNon-compliant 2013 health insurance plans cannot be purchased through the Hawaii Health Connector.\n\nFor the state\u2019s small businesses, Hawaii\u2019s Prepaid Healthcare Act requirements must continue to be met, officials said", "article_metadata": {"expires": 0, "description": "The sheet provides comparisons of existing health insurance plans compared to those provided under President Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act.", "og": {"url": "http://bigislandnow.com/2013/12/11/state-releases-health-insurance-information-sheet/", "type": "article", "image": "http://bigislandnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/gordon-ito-dcca-photo-e1401850053956.jpg", "site_name": "Big Island Now  |  State Releases Health Insurance Information Sheet", "title": "Big Island Now: State Releases Health Insurance Information Sheet"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f01d4f", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "theme-color": "#57ace2", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://bigislandnow.com/wp-content/themes/BigIslandNow2015/library/images/win8-tile-icon.png", "keywords": "hawaii insurance division,insurance commissioner gordon ito,affordable care act,obamacare,hawaii insurance plans,hawaii health plan information,east hawaii news,news,north hawaii news,west hawaii news", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfa5b\"", "article_summary": "The state\u2019s Insurance Division has released an information sheet providing comparisons of existing health insurance plans compared to those provided under President Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act.\nNon-compliant 2013 health insurance plans cannot be purchased through the Hawaii Health Connector.\nHawai`i officials said the information sheet will show premiums offered by Hawaii Medical Services Association (HMSA) and Kaiser Hawaii both on and off the Hawaii Health Connector, the state\u2019s online health insurance marketplace.\nFor the state\u2019s small businesses, Hawaii\u2019s Prepaid Healthcare Act requirements must continue to be met, officials said\nHowever, the state is reminding consumers and small businesses that only ACA-compliant plans purchased through the Hawaii Health Connector will be eligible for tax credits."}
