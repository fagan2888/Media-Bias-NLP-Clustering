The man accused in the July 5 shooting of two Lakewood police officers has been formally charged.

Gordon Lee Moench, 54, has been charged with three counts of attempted first-degree murder – after deliberation, three counts of attempted first-degree murder – extreme indifference, four counts of first-degree assault and 10 counts of crime of violence, according to a news release from the 1st Judicial District Attorney.

Moench is being held on a $2 million cash bond. He is scheduled to appear in court July 24 for a preliminary hearing.

Moench is accused of shooting and injuring Lakewood police Officers Kimberly Collins and Jonathan Key as they responded to a call in the 9700 block of West Jewell Avenue.

When they arrived, Moench was in the back of his pickup and armed with three guns, according to the news release.

Key was shot through the windshield as he was slowing his patrol car near the house. Collins was hit as she was approaching Moench on foot, the news release said.

Moench then began walking down the middle of the street with a .44-caliber Magnum revolver. Moench refused to drop his gun, and when he raised it, a third officer shot him.

Moench was treated at a hospital for his injuries and was taken into custody upon his release.

Collins, who suffered severe leg injuries, remains hospitalized, said Steve Davis, a Lakewood police spokesman. She has undergone multiple surgeries. She is expected to remain hospitalized for one or two more weeks, Davis said.

Key was released from the hospital the day after the shooting but remains on leave, Davis said.

The third officer, who has not been named, also is on leave due to department protocol for officer-involved shootings, Davis said.
