Neurosurgeon Ben Carson is staffing up ahead of a likely Republican run for president, bringing on board the CEO of a marketing company to help raise money, The Daily Caller has learned.

Mike Murray, the president & CEO of TMA Direct, will serve as a senior advisor to Carson should he enter the race, top aide Terry Giles told TheDC on Thursday.

Giles, who has been working behind the scenes to prepare for a campaign, said Murray would oversee all small-dollar grassroots fundraising efforts in a presidential campaign.

“Mike and Ben have collaborated closely during the past year on the Save Our Healthcare Project, the anti-Obamacare program which signed up 600,000 Americans from around the country while raising $6 million dollars with an average donation size of $43,” said Giles, who is expected to serve as campaign chairman.

Carson, who has never run for office, has indicated that he will likely announce his intentions about a 2016 race by May.
