The ads were first broadcast the weekend of Jan. 10 during the NFL playoffs.\n\nIllustrating H&R Block\u2019s point is IRS Publication 5187, which attempts to explain to taxpayers how to comply with the new Obamacare tax requirements. That publication runs for a total of 21 single-spaced pages.\n\nThis year, for the first time, taxpayers will feel the full weight of the Obamacare tax rules, which were enacted in 2010. The new tax code regulations will apply to all Americans who file 2014 tax returns.\n\nSome Obamacare users may discover that they need to repay the government for the subsidies they received to cover their health insurance premiums. A few will discover they were not entitled to insurance at all.\n\nOther taxpayers also will find their refunds are smaller, due to penalties incurred because they didn\u2019t enroll in a government-approved health plan.\n\nPenalties for non-compliance with Obamacare have tripled since 2013, from $95 to an average of $301, according to an email to The Daily Caller from software giant Intuit which runs TurboTax, a competitor to H&R Block.\n\nA large percentage of Obamacare enrollees are low-income earners who opted for the program because they qualified for government subsidies that would lower their monthly insurance payments.\n\nH&R Block\u2019s Tax Institute found in a national survey released last fall that nearly three out of four low-income earners were not aware of the need to file anything with the IRS because of their Obamacare insurance.\n\n\u201cLower-income respondents (72%) are significantly less likely than other income brackets to be aware of the law,\u201d the Institute reported.\n\nFormer IRS Commissioner Mark W. Everson, now vice chairman of Alliantgroup, warns the new Obamacare requirements will deliver a \u201cshock to the system.\u201d\n\n\u201cLow income filers are not used to itemizing and it will be a big challenge for them,\u201d he noted in an interview with TheDC. \u201cYou\u2019re introducing a whole new level of complexity.\u201d\n\nGrace Marie Turner, president of the non-profit Galen Institute and a critic of Obamacare, calls the new IRS filing requirements \u201ca nightmare.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t even know that they have to comply with this law through their tax filing,\u201d she said in an interview with TheDC.\n\nAt the heart of the Obamacare tax rules are three new IRS health-related forms.\n\nOne is Form 1095, which will be sent to the estimated seven million Obamacare enrollees who received a federal subsidy.\n\nTurner warned that many who will receive Form 1095 are likely to throw it out. \u201cMany will think it\u2019s junk mail.\u201d\n\nTo prove they were entitled to subsidies, recipients will have to fill out a second document, Form 8962.\n\nMark Jaeger, a tax team leader at the software company Tax Act, which competes with H&R Block, says Obamacare recipients will be \u201cmost definitely\u201d confused by Form 8962.\n\n\u201cIf they\u2019re trying to do it on their own doing, and do it by hand, that\u2019s going to be pretty difficult for the user,\u201d he told TheDC.\n\nTurner agrees. \u201cMillions of people who were used to doing a simple 1040 EZ form are going to be required, now, to fill out this complicated 8962 tax form.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "rpollock", "description": "Prepare for a 'shock to the system'", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "H&R Block, the nation's largest retail tax preparation company warns that the newly released Obamacare tax code, officially called the Affordable Care Act, is likely to confuse millions of taxpaye", "title": "H&R Block: \u2018No One Can Understand\u2019 New Obamacare Tax Code", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2015/01/19/hr-block-no-one-can-understand-new-obamacare-tax-code/", "image": {"width": 592, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/460502078-1-e1421439438697.jpg", "height": 253}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Prepare for a 'shock to the system'", "title": "H&R Block: \u2018No One Can Understand\u2019 New Obamacare Tax Code Via @dailycaller", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2015/01/19/hr-block-no-one-can-understand-new-obamacare-tax-code/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/460502078-1-e1421439438697.jpg"}, "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-01-19 08:23:50", "sailthru.title": "H&R Block: 'No One Can Understand' New Obamacare Tax Code", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "sailthru.tags": "obamacare,rpollock", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "keywords": "obamacare", "sailthru.description": "H&amp;R Block, the nation's largest retail tax preparation company warns that the newly released Obamacare tax code, officially called the Affordable Care Act, is likely to confuse millions of taxpaye", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/460502078-1-e1421439438697.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe07a7\"", "article_summary": "The tax preparation giant \u2014 with 24 million tax clients worldwide \u2014 reports that the Obamacare tax rules now constitute \u201cthe biggest tax code change in the last 20 years.\u201dThe company is so concerned, it has launched a high profile national television advertising campaign directed solely at Obamacare enrollees.\nMark Jaeger, a tax team leader at the software company Tax Act, which competes with H&R Block, says Obamacare recipients will be \u201cmost definitely\u201d confused by Form 8962.\nIllustrating H&R Block\u2019s point is IRS Publication 5187, which attempts to explain to taxpayers how to comply with the new Obamacare tax requirements.\n\u201cNow that the Affordable Care Act has made health care a tax issue, no one can understand it,\u201d H&R Block flatly tells taxpayers in a video that resides on its dedicated Obamacare web site.\nThis year, for the first time, taxpayers will feel the full weight of the Obamacare tax rules, which were enacted in 2010."}
