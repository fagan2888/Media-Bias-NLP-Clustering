Conservative radio host Dana Loesch was on with Sean Hannity tonight and pressed the importance of voting to give the GOP a complete victory.

With one caveat.

Loesch wanted to make it clear that she really dislikes Harry Reid more than she dislikes any individual Republican running this year, so that should be at the forefront of every conservative voter’s mind. But that being said, she’s a little wary of the Republicans voters elect being so terrible that the voters will be drawn back the other way in just two years:

“Here’s the problem. Say we are successful and we are able to get the Senate. We have a Republican majority in the Senate, a Republican majority in the House. What happens if they suck out loud, Sean? What happens if they’re really bad? You’re paving the way in 2016 for, heaven forbid, Elizabeth Warren or Hillary Clinton.”

And not only that, but when Hannity asked her to pick out a few Republican candidates she really likes, she admitted she really doesn’t have that many.
