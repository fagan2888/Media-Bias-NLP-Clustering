Last summer, a proposal called UtahAccess+ failed to make it before the state\u2019s House of Representatives. However, this new plan would pay the state\u2019s share with a hospital assessment and a new tax on e-cigarettes.In Georgia, there have been fewer concrete steps to expand the Affordable Care Act, but state legislators made statements this week suggesting things may change. State Senator Fran Millar, a Republican, told Georgia Public Broadcasting that expansion was likely at some point to improve access.\u201cI can show you a map that shows you, in certain counties, the only people in the medical field are marriage and family therapists. We have a real problem with the number of providers; we have a problem with nurses, throughout this entire state \u2026 We don\u2019t have sufficient access in many portions of this state.\u201dMillar went on to say that states like Arkansas could provide a model for waivers that could pass muster with conservative lawmakers in Georgia who dislike anything associated with \"Obamacare.\" He said he didn\u2019t known when expansion would happen, but that he thought it was \u201cinevitable.\u201dThen there\u2019s Florida, where Governor Rick Scott had a showdown last year with CMS over extension of funding for the state\u2019s Low-Income Pool , or LIP, a special agreement that sends federal funds to hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of uninsured patients. CMS didn\u2019t fund LIP at prior levels and will cut funding for 2016-2017, which has advocates for Medicaid expansion looking ahead to what will happen to county governments when this shortfall hits.A scathing report issued last week, commissioned by the League of Women Voters and prepared by Florida Legal Services , said that the legislature\u2019s refusal to accept federal funding will be destabilizing for hospitals and county governments alike, in addition to leaving no humane solution for those in the coverage gap.Florida has 1 million people who could gain coverage if the state accepted expansion funds, including 600,000 in the coverage gap, according to Miriam Harmatz, a senior health law attorney with Florida Legal Services and co-author of the report.\u201cWe are in a state (that) hasn\u2019t accepted the funding, so they have no path to affordable coverage,\u201d she told media on a conference call last week.The report\u2019s authors say the refusal to accept Medicaid expansion, and the resulting cuts to the LIP under the terms CMS has imposed, will result in a $4.85 billion loss over 5 years, which will create an $8 billion loss to the state\u2019s gross domestic production, job losses of 15,000 and $8.25 billion in lost income.Florida lawmakers who have rejected Medicaid expansion say the state cannot afford it over the long haul. Scott initially made a statement supporting expansion but then backtracked.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Medicaid Expansion: Utah, Georgia See Movement; Report Blasts Florida Legislators", "og": {"site_name": "AJMC", "image": "https://ajmc.s3.amazonaws.com/_media/_core/ajmc-twitter-logo.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "States that have not expanded Medicaid are seeing the fallout in hospital budgets and in local governments that must make up difference for those who fall in the coverage gap."}, "twitter": {"image": "https://ajmc.s3.amazonaws.com/_media/_core/ajmc-twitter-logo.jpg", "site": "@AJMC_Journal", "card": "summary", "description": "States that have not expanded Medicaid are seeing the fallout in hospital budgets and in local governments that must make up difference for those who fall in the coverage gap."}}, "article_summary": "Last summer, a proposal called UtahAccess+ failed to make it before the state\u2019s House of Representatives.\nStates that have not expanded Medicaid are seeing the fallout in hospital budgets and in local governments that must make up difference for those who fall in the coverage gap.\nScott initially made a statement supporting expansion but then backtracked.\nHowever, this new plan would pay the state\u2019s share with a hospital assessment and a new tax on e-cigarettes.In Georgia, there have been fewer concrete steps to expand the Affordable Care Act, but state legislators made statements this week suggesting things may change.\nState Senator Fran Millar, a Republican, told Georgia Public Broadcasting that expansion was likely at some point to improve access.\u201cI can show you a map that shows you, in certain counties, the only people in the medical field are marriage and family therapists."}
