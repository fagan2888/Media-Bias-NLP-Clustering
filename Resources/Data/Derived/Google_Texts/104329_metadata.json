And all you need is the resources to be able to run them. Why do you need to create something else?\u201d\n\nRELATED CONTENT\n\nThe retired neurosurgeon toured the Azraq camp in northern Jordan under heavy Jordanian security, with journalists barred. Carson\u2019s campaign also limited access, not providing his itinerary.\n\nAfter the Azraq visit, Carson said he didn\u2019t learn anything that gives him confidence in authorities\u2019 ability to screen potential terrorists. \u201cWhat I learned is that you\u2019re going to get a different answer from everybody depending on what their slant is,\u201d he said, reiterating his opposition to allowing any Syrian refugees to come to the United States.\n\nMore than 4 million Syrians have fled their homeland since 2011, after a popular uprising erupted against President Bashar Assad and quickly turned into a devastating civil war. Most initially settled in neighboring countries, but they are largely barred from working legally and have to resort to informal, low-paying jobs if they can find employment at all.\n\nOverwhelmed host countries, particularly Lebanon and Jordan, have balked at the idea of longer-term integration of refugees. They have complained that they are carrying an unfair burden while the international community\u2019s support has fallen short.\n\nA $4.5-billion appeal to aid refugees in host countries in 2015 is only about half funded. The cash crunch has created increasingly unbearable conditions for Syrian refugees in Jordan, Lebanon, Iraq and \u2013 to a lesser extent \u2013 in economically more robust Turkey. In 2015, hundreds of thousands of refugees moved on to Europe in hopes of a better life.\n\nCarson called on the American people \u2013 not the U.S. government \u2013 to launch a \u201chumanitarian drive\u201d to raise billions of dollars that officials say is needed to improve conditions for refugees settled across several countries in the Middle East.\n\n\u201cAll they need is adequate funding. It\u2019s really quite impressive when you go over there and see it,\u201d Carson told the AP, adding that some areas had recreational facilities, schools, electricity and indoor plumbing. \u201cThey were a lot happier. They were quite willing to stay there as long as it takes before they can get back home.\u201d\n\nCarson\u2019s visit comes as he tries to strengthen his fluency on international affairs as foreign policy becomes a greater focus in the 2016 presidential contest. Advisers have conceded that his knowledge of global affairs isn\u2019t where it needs to be and have expressed hope that missions like his two-day trip to Jordan will help.\n\nCarson and other Republicans have adopted a harsh tone when discussing President Barack Obama\u2019s plan to welcome 10,000 Syrian refugees to the U.S. in this budget year. Debate over Syrians fleeing their war-torn country erupted after a series of attacks in Paris earlier this month raised security concerns across the West.\n\nCarson and his GOP rivals expressed concern that extremists may sneak into the U.S. among them. Last week, he likened blocking potential terrorists posing as Syrian refugees to handling \u201cmad dogs.\u201d\n\nHe also suggested that it would be best for Middle Eastern host countries to absorb most of the millions of Syrian refugees that have fled their civil war-torn homeland.\n\nIn a separate statement, he described Syrians as \u201cas very hard working, determined people, which should only enhance the overall economic health of the neighboring Arab countries that accept and integrate them into the general population.\u201d\n\nAnd he broadened his call for financial support beyond Americans: \u201cThe humanitarian crisis presented by the fleeing Syrian refugees can be addressed if the nations of the world with resources would provide financial and material support to the aforementioned countries, as well as encouragement.\u201d\n\nThis report was written by Omar Akour and Steve Peoples of the Associated Press.", "article_metadata": {"description": "After touring Syrian refugee camps in Jordan, Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson on Saturday suggested that camps should serve as a long-term solution for millions, while other refugees could be absorbed by Middle Eastern countries.", "pubdate": 20151129, "og": {"site_name": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "After touring Syrian refugee camps in Jordan, Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson on Saturday suggested that camps should serve as a long-term solution for millions, while other refugees could be absorbed by Middle Eastern countries.", "title": "Carson: Syrian refugees don't want to come to the U.S.", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/RTS1TKA.jpg", "url": "http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/carson-syrian-refugees-dont-want-to-come-to-the-u-s/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "After touring Syrian refugee camps in Jordan, Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson on Saturday suggested that camps should serve as a long-term solution for millions, while other refugees could be absorbed by Middle Eastern countries.", "title": "Carson: Syrian refugees don't want to come to the U.S.", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/RTS1TKA.jpg", "creator": "@newshour", "site": "@newshour", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "fb": {"app_id": 114150878604116}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/newshour", "tag": "Vote 2016"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Ben Carson, Vote 2016"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe081a\"", "article_summary": "Carson and other Republicans have adopted a harsh tone when discussing President Barack Obama\u2019s plan to welcome 10,000 Syrian refugees to the U.S. in this budget year.\nThe cash crunch has created increasingly unbearable conditions for Syrian refugees in Jordan, Lebanon, Iraq and \u2013 to a lesser extent \u2013 in economically more robust Turkey.\n\u201cWhat I learned is that you\u2019re going to get a different answer from everybody depending on what their slant is,\u201d he said, reiterating his opposition to allowing any Syrian refugees to come to the United States.\nLast week, he likened blocking potential terrorists posing as Syrian refugees to handling \u201cmad dogs.\u201dHe also suggested that it would be best for Middle Eastern host countries to absorb most of the millions of Syrian refugees that have fled their civil war-torn homeland.\nAZRAQ REFUGEE CAMP, Jordan \u2014 After touring Syrian refugee camps in Jordan, Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson on Saturday suggested that camps should serve as a long-term solution for millions, while other refugees could be absorbed by Middle Eastern countries."}
