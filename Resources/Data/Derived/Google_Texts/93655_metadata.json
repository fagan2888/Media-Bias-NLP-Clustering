That email then sparked a chain of events that helped the recipient's fianc\u00e9 find the treatment he needed for his pancreatic cancer. VPC\n\nIt's a split second decision you can't undo, that moment after you hit send on an email, to the wrong person.\n\nMarc Gelinas (Photo: WXIA)\n\nIt's a split second decision you can't undo, that moment after you hit send on an email, to the wrong person.\n\nCrystal Lively didn't realize her mistake. Or that it was about to help someone in big trouble.\n\n\"We got engaged on a Saturday and on Wednesday he was diagnosed.\"\n\nThat mistake email popped into Donna Frederick's inbox two days after her fiance Marc Gelinas had been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. She remembers, \"He was given this diagnosis at the end of the day on Wednesday. The next day is Thanksgiving. There's not a doctor in the office.\"\n\nThat weekend is when Lively, an area manager with Mattress Firm, sent the email 'Purple Perspectives,' to her fellow managers. It was an update on the latest research from Mattress Firm's big cause, pancreatic cancer. Purple dots every store, on trees and signs that show its commitment, along with the $2 million dollars the company has given to research.\n\nSitting in their condo, Marc recalls, \"It was completely coincidence. She was accidentally added to an email thread in a corporate environment.\"\n\nDonna, who works for a venue where Mattress Firm was holding its holiday party, called Crystal during Black Friday weekend after she received the email. Lively says she was shocked to discover her mistake.\n\n\"Just the varied emotions because how busy we were in the store,\" she said. \"First thinking I'm going to be in trouble because I sent the email to the wrong person but then thinking 'This is okay, we can help them!' It worked out to be a small miracle.\"\n\nAnd suddenly the sales of mattresses became secondary to connecting Marc and Donna with experts and help, and hope. Phone calls flew around the country that day. Lively says, \"They were so scared. They were left with no information other than the diagnosis.\"\n\nMattress Firm foundation members got Marc and Donna in touch with the team at Emory that they recommended.\n\nDonna and Marc walked into Emory and the journey began. Chemo shrank the tumor. Surgery removed it.\n\n\"They got all of it,\" Marc says.\n\nMark was cancer free for their August 15th wedding this summer. \"It was like the end of what I went through. I needed that date. to be steadfast.\"\n\nIt was a mistake that became a happy accident. Donna says it was a message from God in her inbox. \"I remember telling my mom I waited 38 years for this man and i'm not going out like this so we both just said what do we have to do.\"\n\nFor more stories like this, visit Humankind on Facebook.\n\nSkip Ad Ad Loading... x Embed x Share HUMANKIND: ACTS OF KINDNESS Puppy born without back paws gets leg up on life | 1:41 Being born without back paws hasn't stopped this playful pup.
