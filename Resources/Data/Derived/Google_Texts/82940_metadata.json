She had been sexually abused. She was just three months old.\n\nWelcome to Papua New Guinea, one of the most dangerous countries in the world for women and children.\n\nThis is a place where women are raped, killed and maimed on a shocking scale.\n\nThis brutality is so severe women are stabbed with bush knives, injured with axes, burnt, speared and even bitten.\n\nRape and sexual assault are common and violence is estimated to hit two in three households, compared to one in three globally.\n\nAnd according to figures from children's charity Child Fund victims under 16 make up half the people who seek medical help after being raped.\n\nMore alarmingly, one in four is younger than 12 and one in 10 is under eight.\n\nOut of the 148 countries listed on the UNDP's 2012 Gender Inequality Index, PNG ranks at 134, placing it in the bottom 10 per cent of countries worldwide.\n\nIn a recent survey by the Economist of the least livable cities in the world, its capital, Port Moresby, ranked third-worst.\n\nBut while the figures make for some depressing reading, ChildFund's Stop Violence Against Women and Children in Papua New Guinea report shows there is positive change happening from within.\n\nAccording to the charity, women and men in PNG are standing up against the violence and new laws (such as the Family Protection Bill passed in September) making domestic violence a criminal offence in PNG, are helping.\n\nWomen like Kay are also speaking up and telling their stories in the hope that further action and progress will be made.\n\nChildFund's Marketing Director Di Mason said all this was taking place was just 8km from our shores.\n\nMs Mason said a lack of access to medical help, lack of education and lack of enforcement all remained massive issues in the country.\n\n\"If a woman is hurt and she wants to report abuse, she must pay $10 for a medical certificate,\" she said.\n\n\"This is a place where 37 per cent of the population live in poverty, that's a meal for their families.\"\n\nShe added many women needed the medical certificate in court and often chose food and self healing over treatment.\n\nBut Ms Mason was quick to add that as sad as the situation was for some people things were starting to change with education and through people such as Kay who were beginning to speak out against violence.\n\n\"She's an incredibly brave, loving mum who was beaten repeatedly by her husband,\" she said.\n\n\"Her own daughter was also beaten and was severely injured after having her face smashed, but she escaped and got help.\"\n\nKay and her children sought shelter at Port Moresby's Haus Ruth, a safe haven for survivors of abuse.\n\n\"Change is possible for PNG, it's a wonderful country and we're really starting to see it come though already,\" she said.\n\n\"It's heroic people are telling their stories in order to change the dialogue in their country, and more people are starting to act and support this movement.\"\n\n* ChildFund is currently raising funds to provide critical medical care and support services for women and children affected by violence, It's also working with men and young people through community education and training programs to change existing attitudes and behaviours.
