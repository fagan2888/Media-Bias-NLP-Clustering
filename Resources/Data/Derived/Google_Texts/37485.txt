PLANT CITY The son of a Dover couple was recently promoted to Air Force colonel as he prepares to move onto a new assignment as a group commander at Tinker Air Force Base.

David Robertson, son of Gene and Shirley Robertson of Dover, received his promotion during a ceremony at the Museum of Aviation at Robins Air Force Base, Warner Robins, Ga.

Robertson, a 1988 Plant City High School graduate, has served for more than 20 years. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant in May 1992 after completing the four-year Air Force ROTC program at the University of Florida.

His assignments over two decades of service have spanned the globe, from the Middle East to the Caribbean to Turkey.

Robertson currently serves as the battle watch chief - providing command and control to Air Force forces worldwide - at the Force Generation Center at Robins Air Force Base.

In January, he assumes command of the 513th Air Control Group at Tinker Air Force Base in Oklahoma, where he will oversee E-3 Sentry (AWACS) flight operations, including maintenance and staff.

Robertson and his wife of 14 years, Krista, have two children, 9-year-old Savannah and 7-year-old Camden.
