First, there was Obamacare, and now, Democrats on Capitol Hill want to require parents to have their children vaccinated to attend public school.

As Shark Tank reports, it was created to prevent children from contracting some other parent’s kid’s “cooties,” but the” Vaccinate All Children Act of 2015,” sponsored by Florida Democratic Frederica Wilson, is nothing more than the federal government trying to dictate American health care–like Obamacare.

In fact, let’s call this bill “Kid-O-Care.” This is Obamacare for your kids.

“Wilson’s bill, if passed, would, for the first time, establish a federal vaccination requirement to attend school,” reports the Autism Action Network. “Current vaccines policies are set by the states, but with the increasing federal control over schools with No Child Left Behind and the Common Core, Wilson’s bill maybe [sic] an indicator of what is coming.”

Wilson’s bill reads:

For a State or a political subdivision or other public entity of a State to be eligible to receive a grant under this section, the applicant shall demonstrate to the Secretary’s satisfaction that … the State requires each student enrolled in one of the State’s public elementary schools or public secondary schools to be vaccinated in accordance with the recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.

Where are the parents here?

This bill would essentially shut out parents from having a say in the matter.
