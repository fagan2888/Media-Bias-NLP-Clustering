It\u2019s easy to see why. A paid family leave program, which would likely cost more than $20 billion a year, would be financed by an increase in payroll taxes. In other words, a tax increase on middle and lower class families\u2014something Obama explicitly promised he wouldn\u2019t do. In turn, the president has found himself in a position Republicans know well: Trapped by a shortsighted campaign promise that has made him unable to govern.\n\nIn September 2008, then-candidate Barack Obama made a clear promise to supporters in New Hampshire. \u201cAnd I can make a firm pledge: under my plan, no family making less than $250,000 will see their taxes increase\u2014not your income taxes, not your payroll taxes, not your capital gains taxes, not any of your taxes,\u201d he said. Politifact believes he has already broken that promise because the Affordable Care Act includes a tax on indoor tanning services. And in the Supreme Court\u2019s words, Obamacare\u2019s penalty for not buying insurance is a tax. Obama disputes Politifact\u2019s interpretation, but regardless, an increase in payroll taxes would unquestionably break his pledge. The result: Obama is stuck unable to propose anything substantial.\n\nThis isn\u2019t entirely Obama\u2019s fault of course. Politically, proposing taxes on anyone, but the rich is difficult. Senate Democrats are not exactly clamoring to do so. But they are going to frequently find themselves in this position if they continue to promise not to raise middle class taxes\u2014especially when they define the upper threshold of middle class at $250,000 in income. Ninety-nine percent of Americans made less than $250,000 in 2012. It\u2019s absurd to argue that just 1 percent of Americans are in the upper-class.\n\nBut beyond this definitional problem, Democrats must admit that middle class taxes will have to rise to finance all of their policy priorities. New programs like paid family leave or universal pre-k cost money, year after year. The New America foundation has a plan to create an additional social security benefit. It would cost 3.7 percent of GDP in 2035. For comparison, individual income taxes in total brought in 7.9 percent of GDP in 2013. We can finance these liberal programs with debt for a short period\u2014and in this economic environment, I would argue that\u2019s smart policy\u2014but eventually we will need to address our long-term debt. And that\u2019s going to require more than increased taxes on the rich.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "description": "At the Washington Post&nbsp;on Monday, Zachary Goldfarb made a very good catch: President Barack Obama\u2019s policy proposals for paid family leave have not lived up to his rhetoric.
