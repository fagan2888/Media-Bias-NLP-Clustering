Megyn Kelly has had it with arguing about Obamacare.

The Fox News host had to bury her head in her hands during an interview with Democratic strategist and pollster Bernard Whitman. On Tuesday night, the two were debating the recent video footage showing Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist Jonathan Gruber, who helped draft the Affordable Care Act, saying that the "stupidity of the American voter" helped to pass Obamacare in 2010.

Whitman, to Kelly's disbelief, argued that the Affordable Care Act has in fact brought success and that "everybody knew exactly what they were getting."

"Oh, my God," Kelly said. "Seriously? Seriously? Everyone knew what they were getting? Is that what you want the viewers to believe?"

"My head is about to explode," she said, planting her head face down in her palms.

But Kelly continued to fight back throughout the interview, arguing that the law was passed "based on a lie."

â€œThey [the government] rely on people that lie to our faces!" she shouted.
