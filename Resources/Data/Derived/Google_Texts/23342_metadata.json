There is no avoiding it. With a terminal disease, there is time to fight and a time to make peace. For some people, hearing the words \u201cHave you considered hospice?\u201d evokes a sense of capitulation. It need not. Choosing hospice at the end of life does not mean giving up but choosing to live as fully as possible in the time left.\n\nMy dad fought cancer valiantly but when the treatments were no longer working, our family determined to get the most out of the remaining days with the support of Denver Hospice. When Dad was able go out to dinner or movies, we did that. Hospice provided the walker and wheelchair. Once housebound, we played cards. Hospice ensured that Dad\u2019s pain was controlled without dimming his mind. He could still play a mean hand of gin rummy.\n\nIn the final weeks, hospice gave us everything we needed for dad to remain home. I remember sitting by his beside as he slept and listening to the sounds of summer streaming through the open window and the murmuring voices of family friends down the hall who\u2019d come to say goodbye. Dying is hard, but it does not have to be divorced from life or love.\n\nThe support did not end after Dad\u2019s death. Hospice recognizes that, \u201cThere is a time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance.\u201d Mom joined a hospice grief group for spouses. The counseling and community helped her heal.\n\nNovember is Hospice and Palliative Care month, and it is worth celebrating. Most Americans, when polled, say they would prefer to die at home with care that keeps them free of pain. Colorado\u2019s 54 hospices enable patients to be at home or at a hospice facility where they receive palliative care and symptom control, and other physical, mental, and spiritual support services according to their needs and desires.\n\nWhen patients accept that the end is near, they can more fully embrace opportunities for reconciliation and reminiscence. They can also cast off restraints that no longer make sense. Want to eat bacon for lunch every day? Snuggle with your dog? Smoke a cigar? Where hospitals must say \u201cno,\u201d hospice can say \u201cyes.\u201d\n\nWhile half of all Coloradans receive hospice support during end of life, some Coloradans still do not know what hospice can do for them and their family. Hospice and Palliative Care month is an opportunity to share information and break down misconceptions. Even before one is diagnosed with a terminal disease, it is empowering to know about one\u2019s options regarding not only hospice, but also advance care directives, medical power of attorney, and organ donation.\n\nIn January, Medicare will begin reimbursing doctors for time spent with patients discussing end of life care. These conversations are not the \u201cdeath panels\u201d they were falsely portrayed as six years ago. Discussions are voluntary, and in Colorado, patients are protected from euthanasia and assisted suicide. End of life care conversations are about living life to the fullest along an inevitable journey, not cutting that journey short.\n\nDeath is unavoidable. Knowing one\u2019s options, including the availability of hospice and palliative care, is essential to living well.
