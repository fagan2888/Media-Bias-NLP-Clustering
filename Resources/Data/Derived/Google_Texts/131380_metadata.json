These agents will be available for one-on-one consultations with patients 12 hours per week at Rite Aid stores in most states, and may even help sign up uninsured customers for Medicaid coverage or an Obamacare marketplace policy right in the store.\n\nRite Aid spokespeople emphasized that although the agents would be paid commissions for selling policies, they would not be beholden to one specific insurance company, instead concentrating on finding policies that would make the most sense for individual customers.\n\nThe news comes on the heels of CVS and Walgreens pharmacies\u2019 similar decisions to reach out to the public about Obamacare.
