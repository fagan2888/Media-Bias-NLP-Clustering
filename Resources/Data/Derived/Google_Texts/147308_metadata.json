Peterson Foundation said Tuesday.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cAs Washington prepares to get back to work this fall, voters are calling for increased focus on the nation\u2019s long-term fiscal challenges,\u201d said Michael A. Peterson, president and COO of the Peterson Foundation.\n\n\u201cRegardless of political party, Americans understand we need to address our long-term fiscal challenges to support a growing, thriving economy.\u201d\n\nThe index, modeled after consumer confidence gauges, measures attitudes about the nation\u2019s long-term debt and the efforts of elected officials to address fiscal issues.\n\nAny reading above 100 indicates positive sentiment.\n\nA majority of respondents \u2014 83 percent \u2014 agreed in the survey that the nation\u2019s national debt is an issue that President Obama and Congress should be spending more time addressing, including 64 percent who say that lawmakers should spend \u201ca lot\u201d more time on the issue.\n\nThis concern over the nation's $17.6 trillion debt spans party lines, with 92 percent of Republicans and 76 percent of Democrats agreeing that Washington needs to focus more on the issue.\n\nCongress is set to return Sept. 8 from a five-week summer recess but is expected to focus on passing a continuing resolution to keep the government running through the elections and into the lame-duck session.\n\nThe survey showed that concern about the debt is 37, indicating deep concern.\n\nThe score for debt as a priority that leaders must address is 24, a sign that voters want elected leaders to make addressing long-term debt a high priority.\n\nWhen asked about expectations about progress on the debt, the score was 69, indicating strong pessimism about the direction of long-term fiscal policy in the next few years.\n\nThe nationwide poll included 1,001 registered voters contacted between Aug. 18-21.
