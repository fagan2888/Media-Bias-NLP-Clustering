Nevada lawmakers emphasized the VA Medical Center in North Las Vegas will not be closing.\n\nNonetheless, a potential cutoff in veterans health care \u2019\u0080\u0094 first floated by the VA last week \u2014\u0080\u0094 has served to focus lawmakers' attention even more tightly on the department\u2019\u0080\u0099s latest fiscal crisis.\n\nSome expressed irritation the VA was dumping a problem onto Congress seemingly at the last minute, and frightening veterans at the same time.\n\n\"I don'\u0080\u0099t like the fact they are putting us in a tough spot right now,\"\u0080\u009d said Sen. Dean Heller, R-Nev., who sits on the Senate'\u0080\u0099s committee on veterans.\n\n\"\u0080\u009cFor them to hold us over a barrel and say we are going to start closing hospitals and scaring veterans \u0080\u0094\u2014 I can assure you that is not going to happen \u2014 but for the VA to be sending that message out there is thoughtless at a minimum and heartless at most,\" Heller said.\n\n\"We are diligently working to ensure (shutdowns) do not occur and that no veterans will be denied the care they need and deserve,\" Reps. Jeff Miller, R-Fla., and Charlie Dent, R-Pa., said in a statement as chairmen of House committees that oversee the VA.\n\n\"There's a lot of teeth-gnashing and hair-pulling but the fact of the matter is we can'\u0080\u0099t let the hospitals close,\"\u0080\u009d Rep. Dina Titus, D-Nev., told McDonald at a hearing Wednesday in the House Veterans Affairs Committee.\n\nAt the hearing, Miller said it was \"\u0080\u009cunprecedented\"\u0080\u009d for the VA to bust a budget. He questioned why the agency was slow to identify a looming shortfall in health programs and then was slow in informing Congress about it.\n\n\"\u0080\u009cI am disappointed about the slow, painstaking revelation of this crisis by the department that is led by you,\" Miller told McDonald. \"Somebody somewhere took their eye off the ball.\"\n\nTitus said there are no signs the VA Medical Center in North Las Vegas is preparing to wind down.\n\nBut Titus said persistent VA funding woes might hamper ongoing projects to expand the emergency department and finish the hospital administration building and community living center.\n\n\"\u0080\u009cWhat is more of a concern to me is moving forward, are we going to be able to expand? Are we going to be able to do projects?\"\u0080\u009d she said. \"I don'\u0080\u0099t think they will be closing anything but will we be able to keep up?\"\u0080\u009d\n\nAs it carried out reforms from a health care scandal in summer 2014, the VA has seen a sharp upswing in the number of veterans obtaining services. At the same time, expensive new medicine to treat hepatitis C has strained budgets. And the VA says it is constrained by an outdated computer system that makes it difficult to keep track of its finances.\n\nMcDonald said the VA initially believed it could solve the financial problem in-house but discovered that would not be possible.\n\nSenate Veterans Committee Chairman Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., said a bill that will likely pass next week would allow the VA to combine accounting for a number of its health programs, giving McDonald flexibility he has requested to shift funds around to address shortfalls .\n\nIsakson said the solution would \"\u0080\u009cprovide the funds the VA needs to meet the shortfall and solve that problem not just for the temporary time being but for a long time to come.\"\u0080\u009d\n\nIn his appearance, McDonald warned that VA money needs will only grow in the coming years as service members who served in Afghanistan and Iraq enter the health care system.\n\n\"We can'\u0080\u0099t be shortsighted,\"\u0080\u009d he said.\n\nSenate panel OKs Heller reform bill\n\nThe Senate Veterans Affairs Committee approved by voice vote the measure by Sens. Dean Heller, R-Nev., and Bob Casey, D-Pa., that would require the Government Accountability Office to assess the management of 56 VA regional offices to determine if claims are being handled consistently.\n\nAmong other things, the bill also calls for the VA to establish training programs for service managers and for the agency\u2019s inspector general to assess how VA outposts set timelines and deadlines for handling claims.\n\nIt comes as the VA claims improvements in reducing backlogs of benefit applications, including at the regional office in Reno that has ranked among the slowest.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be the first to admit there is no silver bullet in solving all the VA claims problems and backlog issues but I think this bill puts it closer to permanently addressing this backlog and holding the VA accountable,\u201d Heller said during the committee session.\n\nBefore voicing its approval the committee attached a bill by Heller and Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, calling on the Department of Defense to develop a plan to award benefits to Filipino veterans who fought alongside U.S. soldiers in the Pacific during World War II.\n\nAlso added were provisions allowing the spouse of a deceased or service-disabled veteran who owned a small business to retain preferences to qualify for government contracts.\n\nContact Review-Journal Washington Bureau Chief Steve Tetreault at stetreault@reviewjournal.com or 202-783-1760.
