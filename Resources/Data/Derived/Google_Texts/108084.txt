Alamosa County commissioners are applying to the Federal Aviation Administration to use two types of drones for search and rescue, firefighting and aerial agricultural inspections.

The county needs federal approval under new laws for drones.

The new laws require that the drones be flown where the operator can see them to avoid crashes and to follow FAA flight rules.
