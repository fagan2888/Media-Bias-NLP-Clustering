The goal of the program is to inspire young people to continue working to make a difference in their communities.\n\nAvila has worked for the Affordable Care Act, educating families on health care and helping individuals with \u201cObamacare\u201d enrollment, and has been an advocate since 2007 for the DREAM Act and for immigration reform, according to the White House. It said her significant impact within the Hispanic community and her contributions to the Isac Amaya Foundation \u2013 a scholarship organization that helps low-income students pursue a college degree \u2013 are what brought her to the White House this week.\n\n\u201cI believe there was a series of nominations,\u201d Avila said after the event. \u201cPeople were able to nominate community members and then the White House selected 11 of them, and that\u2019s how I was selected.\u201d\n\nTachine was nominated by her students, who submitted an online video through first lady Michelle Obama\u2019s \u201creach higher\u201d initiative that detailed Tachine\u2019s contributions to the Navajo Nation. White House materials said Tachine has worked to ensure that Native American students can continue their educations, through a college-mentoring program known as Native SOAR (Student, Outreach, Access and Resiliency.)\n\n\u201cOur students created a five-minute video on YouTube and talked about the work that we did,\u201d said Tachine, who is Navajo. That video was enough to impress someone in the White House and earn her a Champion of Change invitation.\n\nThe long-awaited Sept. 15 event included meetings with White House aides and discussions among the women on the work they are doing in their communities.\n\nStanding outside the White House afterward, both Tachine and Avila said the event was like a dream come true.\n\n\u201cWe moved here, we started from zero pretty much,\u201d Avila said of her family\u2019s trip to this country. \u201cThanks to them, the pillars of my mom my brothers, I got to college, I graduated and now I\u2019m doing the work I\u2019m doing.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The White House regularly selects a variety of recipients for the program, ranging in the past from faith leaders on climate issues to immigrant innovators, from educators to entrepreneurs, and more.
