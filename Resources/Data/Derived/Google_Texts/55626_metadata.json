The women, much to their own dismay, find that their lives are permanently intertwined and, much to their surprise, they find they have each other.\n\n\n\nThe comedy, which will debut in 2015, is written and created by Kauffman and Howard J. Morris (TBS' Sullivan & Son, According to Jim, Home Improvement). Kauffman, Morris, Paula Weinstein, Fonda, Tomlin and Skydance's David Ellison, Dana Goldberg and Marcy Ross are on board to executive produce.\n\n\n\nPHOTOS: From 'Arrested Development' to 'House of Cards,' Exclusive Portraits of Netflix\n\n\n\n\"Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin are among the funniest and most formidable actresses ever and it's an incredible privilege to give them the opportunity to run riot on Netflix,\" said Netflix chief content officer Ted Sarandos. \"The show created for them by Marta and Howard is warm, very funny and anything but wholesome. We can't wait.\"\n\n\n\nFor Skydance, Grace and Frankie marks the TV division's second series order and first comedy. It joins WGN's John Benjamin Hickey atomic bomb drama Manhattan. On the film side, the company is also producing the Terminator reboot, due in July 2015, as well as Mission: Impossible 5. Skydance's credits include Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit, World War Z, Star Trek: Into Darkness and more.\n\n\n\n\"Netflix is redefining the way we produce and consume television and it's a true privilege to be in business with Ted and his amazing team,\" said Ellison. \"Working with the wonderfully talented Marta, Jane, Lily, Howard and their producer Paula Weinstein is a dream come true, and the story they have crafted is both hilarious and heartfelt.\"\n\n\n\nThe comedy comes 34 years after Fonda and Tomlin starred in 9 to 5.
