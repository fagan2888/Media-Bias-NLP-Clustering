History says no.\n\nIt\u2019s no secret the team must upgrade its pitching, which was the worst in the big leagues. But is general manager Jeff Bridich planning to make a bold and dramatic move \u2014 via a free-agent signing or a trade \u2014 to immediately upgrade the rotation?\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a tough question,\u201d Bridich said recently. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen any of the market play out yet, or even begin to, so it\u2019s a tough question to answer. I think there are \u2014 in terms of our depth \u2014 some internal answers that we are very hopeful that we are going to have, next year.\u201d\n\nIn other words, look for the Rockies to develop their young talent to improve their pitching and not spend big for a free-agent ace.\n\nThe Rockies certainly need upgrades. Colorado\u2019s pitching staff allowed a 5.04 ERA, 844 runs and a .278 opponent batting average, all of which were major-league worsts.\n\nThat said, Bridich\u2019s decision to trade star shortstop Troy Tulowitzki to Toronto last summer for pitching prospects shows that he is willing to deal. If a team approaches Bridich about a trade for rejuvenated right fielder Carlos Gonzalez, he will certainly listen.\n\nThe Rockies have a young, talented lineup, but would they surprise and make a run at a player such as power hitting free-agent first baseman Chris Davis? It seems unlikely, but if they were to trade Gonzalez for pitching, then spending money on a free-agent power hitter could make sense.\n\nRockies roster\n\nA look at the Rockies roster for next season:\n\nGUARANTEED CONTRACTS\n\nPos., Player Contract commitment\n\nSS Jose Reyes $48 million through 2017*\n\nRF Carlos Gonzalez $37 million through 2017\n\nP Jorge De La Rosa $12.5 million through 2016\n\nP Boone Logan $6.25 million through 2016\n\nC Nick Hundley $3.15 million through 2016\n\nIF Daniel Descalso $2.1million through 2016\n\nP Tyler Chatwood $1 million through 2016\n\n* Includes $4 million buyout on 2018 option\n\nARBITRATION-ELIGIBLE PLAYERS\n\nPos., Player Projected salary\n\nP John Axford $6.3 million\n\nP Adam Ottavino $1.5 million\n\nP Jordan Lyles $2.8 million\n\nP Rex Brothers $1.5 million\n\n2B DJ LeMahieu $3.5 million\n\nC Wilin Rosario$3 million\n\nCF Charlie Blackmon$4.5 million\n\nOF Brandon Barnes $1.2 million\n\n3B Nolan Arenado $6.5 million\n\nPOSSIBLE PLAYERS TO BE NON-TENDERED\n\nAxford, Brothers, Rosario, Barnes\n\nFREE AGENTS\n\nRHP/starter Kyle Kendrick\n\n1B Justin Morneau*\n\n* Rockies declined $9 million mutal option\n\nTop 10 MLB free agents\n\nNational baseball writer Patrick Saunders looks at the top free agents to hit the market:\n\n1.
