If successful, SHS\u2019 new model could produce healthier students while simultaneously reducing the uninsured rate among them.\n\nHowever, it could require using student-health dollars and referring students who need ongoing care to FIU Health or off-campus providers to get it done.\n\nPrimary care will remain\n\nHealth economists from the University\u2019s Collaborative for Health Economics and Strategic Solutions created a model and its first piece includes treatment of minor conditions and referrals for more serious conditions, these are the first and second part, respectively. SHS managed these two in the course of its normal operations.\n\nAccording to Oscar Loynaz, director of SHS, the Board of Trustees have approved the model and integration began on July 1.\n\nVice President of Student Affairs Larry Lunsford said as of July 1 that FIU Health manages the clinical aspects of SHS.\n\nBut students can still visit SHS to receive basic services \u2013 vaccinations, screenings, or physical examinations \u2013 and for treatment of minor conditions, illnesses and injuries.\n\n\u201cEven though changes are occurring as integration moves forward, right now nothing specifically has changed and those with chronic conditions can still visit and will be seen,\u201d Loynaz said.\n\nFor conditions that require ongoing care of more than 30 days, healthcare navigators will refer students to providers in the community, and FIU Health is an option.\n\nA healthcare navigator \u2013 one at the Modesto Maidique Campus and one at the Biscayne Bay Campus \u2013 is a new position the University created for the integration. They will connect students who visit SHS and lack health insurance to healthcare providers in the community.\n\n\u201cThey would be treated regardless but the navigators will connect them to the appropriate level of healthcare,\u201d Metula said.\n\nAmy Metula, former director of quality management for FIU Health, assured students in an interview with Student Media that the people who will vaccinate or test them for a minor illness will still be there even as the University merges its on-campus health providers\n\n\u201cIt will be the same people with the same uniforms providing care,\u201d Metula said.\n\nMetula resigned from the University for unspecified reasons; Student Media interviewed her prior to her resignation and before receiving the reports associated with the integration plan.\n\nHowever, her comments give context to the information the reports provide in lieu of an interview with Eneida Roldan, interim chief executive officer of FIU Health. Roldan was not available as of press time.\n\nThe University\u2019s clinical faculty from its health-related colleges provide medical services to the community and will, under the plan, see students as well.\n\n\u201cStudent Health will share efficiencies and resources and work with FIU Health,\u201d Metula said.\n\nInsurance enrollment and population health\n\nThe model separates student health into one piece for individuals and another for the population.\n\nPromoting health insurance enrollment and managing student health on a large scale are a part of the population aspect.\n\nIn the model, CHESS proposed SHS will have an active role in getting students health insurance.\n\n\u201cSHS should set explicit targets for insurance coverage\u201d and \u201cevaluate, after one year of operations, options for subsidized coverage for students not qualified for Medicaid or other health care insurance.\u201d\n\nCHESS proposed using the student health fee to reduce the cost of healthcare coverage, \u201csubsidies should be self-funded by student health fee dollars.\u201d\n\nThe health fee is one of several mandatory fees charged to all students as part of their tuition each semester.\n\nEvery student pays $93.69 as part of the health fee regardless of the number of credits taken.\n\nAn aspect of the integration plan is to divvy up the money generated from the health fee, so that a portion remains with Student Affairs to pay for other areas concerning student health, and another chunk of it will go to FIU Health, according to Loynaz.\n\nUnlike the athletic and activity and service fees which are based on per-credit hour, the health fee is by headcount.\n\nIn their model, CHESS projected reducing the uninsurance rate among students to 19 percent by 2019-2020 from the 25 percent in 2013-2014, based on data from the HBC report.\n\nThe 2020 goal is still far above the national average of 6 percent uninsured students.\n\nThe goals of the population aspect are to make sure students understand their own healthcare options reducing the risk factors and conditions that affect students\u2019 performance in class and job opportunities.\n\nPopulation health is a survey done of a community and determine what factors contribute to different diseases and what students have certain conditions, according to Loynaz.\n\nAn educational component then follows the survey to help the community remain healthy.\n\nWhether students\u2019 health needs come from ongoing conditions or risky behaviors, population health look at ways to meet their needs.\n\n\u201cRather than improve the health of one person at a time, population health does so for a group of individuals, in this case it\u2019s the student community,\u201d Metula said.\n\nACA influence on integration\n\nThe healthcare industry has changed since the passing of President Barack Obama\u2019s healthcare law, the Affordable Care Act.\n\nAccording to Metula, the Board of Trustees asked the University to have FIU Health and SHS work together because of the new \u201chealthcare landscape\u201d the ACA has created.\n\n\u201cIt really is affecting the student population,\u201d Metula said said to Student Media.\n\nAn aspect of the law, passed in 2009, is that young adults can stay on their parents\u2019 health insurance until they reach 26.\n\nThe 18-24 year old demographic now has health insurance whereas prior to the passing of the ACA they did not.\n\nThere is also a mandate from the federal government to have health insurance. Those without it are subject to tax penalties, or fees.\n\n\u201cRecognizing that more and more students can or will get insurance,\u201d Metula said. \u201cWe needed to make sure we were providing the best out of that dollar and get it back to the students.\u201d\n\nTo get those dollars to students and make sure their health needs do not negatively impact their academic success, University administrators decided to merge the clinical operations of SHS with FIU Health.\n\n\u201cThe goal is to make sure students are successful with their academics,\u201d Metula said. \u201cThat\u2019s always been the goal.\u201d\n\nFIU Health will consider student feedback on an ongoing basis as part of their evaluation of services, Metula said.\n\n\u201cWe are still here for the same goal, which is protecting students\u2019 academic performance,\u201d and \u201cWe will collaborate to continue to do so.\u201d\n\nBefore integration there was consultation\n\nBetween 2012 and 2014 University administrators sought the advice of two collegiate health consultants and took one of those reports to its own health economists, who then crafted a model for how student health at FIU will operate if FIU Health officials set the plan in motion without suggesting any changes to the Board of Trustees.\n\nCHESS provided the health economists and they proposed a \u201cservice model for an integrated FIU Health-SHS\u201d based on a site visit done by Hodgkins-Beckley Consulting | Stephen L. Beckley and Associates.\n\nThe model, its accompanying report, the HBC report and one from the American College Health Association were obtained through a records request by Student Media.\n\nIn December 2012 two reviewers from ACHA surveyed FIU\u2019s health services \u2013 SHS and the FIU HealthCare Network \u2013 and gave University administrators two options: leave both as they were, or integrate them.\n\nHBC left administrators with seven options of how to change SHS\u2019 model for providing care.\n\nThe options were to maintain operations as they were, request bids from healthcare providers for services to the FIU community, slowly work with FIU Health over time, SHS could contract with the HCN for primary care, establish a secondary payer for primary care, discontinue primary care\n\nall together, or adopt an insurance requirement.\n\nAdministrators chose to integrate, according to interviews with the director of SHS, the vice president of Student Affairs and the former director of quality management for FIU Health.\n\nThe model CHESS proposed includes a mix of the choices the consultants gave University administrators.", "article_metadata": {"description": "An operation such as the University\u2019s merger of the clinical components of Student Health Services with FIU Health.
