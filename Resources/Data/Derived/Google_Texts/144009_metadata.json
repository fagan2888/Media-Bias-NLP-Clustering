This year Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services included chronic lung problems and elective hip and knee replacements.\n\nIn 2010 St. Vincent\u2019s joint-replacement program had recently been created and was \u201cgrowing rapidly,\u201d Kyle Sanders, president St. Vincent\u2019s Southside, said in an email.\n\n\u201cWe feel this may have contributed to some elevated months early on; rates have improved as the program has matured,\u201d Sanders said.\n\nHe said readmission rates in the early part of 2014 were well below the national average.\n\nAll other hospitals in surrounding counties were penalized below 1 percent.\n\nDerek Gilliam: (904) 359-4619", "article_metadata": {"description": "The federal government hit 79 percent of Florida hospitals with a penalty on future Medicare payments with one local facility being penalized the most in the state.St. Vincent\u2019s Medical Center Southside won\u2019t receive full payment for treatment of Medicare patients as too many of its patients returned to the Jacksonville hospital for additional care before 30 days after being admitted to the facility.", "application-name": "Jacksonville.com", "og": {"site_name": "jacksonville.com", "description": "St. Vincent's Medical Center Southside won't receive full payment for treatment of Medicare patients as too many of its patients returned to the Jacksonville hospital for additional care.", "title": "St. Vincent's Southside penalized most in state for poor performance with Medicare patients", "url": "http://jacksonville.com/news/health-and-fitness/2014-10-20/story/st-vincents-southside-penalized-most-state-poor-performance", "image": "http://jacksonville.com/sites/default/files/promo_StVincentsSouthside.jpg", "type": "article"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#426ab2", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://jacksonville.com/files/img/editorial/Win8Tiles/Win8icon70x70tiny1.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://jacksonville.com/files/img/editorial/Win8Tiles/Win8iconLarge1.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://jacksonville.com/files/img/editorial/Win8Tiles/wide310x150.png", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://jacksonville.com/files/img/Win8icon.png", "keywords": "Health and Fitness, Metro, News", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://jacksonville.com/files/img/editorial/Win8Tiles/Win8icon150x150square1.png", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"articleid": 627268, "publishtime": "2014-10-20T22:16:57Z"}}}, "article_summary": "In 2010 St. Vincent\u2019s joint-replacement program had recently been created and was \u201cgrowing rapidly,\u201d Kyle Sanders, president St. Vincent\u2019s Southside, said in an email.\nSt. Vincent\u2019s Southside was penalized near the maximum allowed, but in the previous two years the hospital received penalties of .14 percent and .15 percent.\nFor a 15,000 procedure \u2014 say a kidney surgery \u2014 performed at St. Vincent\u2019s Southside that is billed to the Medicare program, the hospital will receive $14,571 \u2014 a penalty of $429.\nSt. Vincent\u2019s Medical Center Southside won\u2019t receive full payment for treatment of Medicare patients as too many of its patients returned to the Jacksonville hospital for additional care before 30 days after being admitted to the facility.\nThe penalty is 2.86 percent of any reimbursement from the federally funded Medicare program from October 2014 through September 2015, according to information released by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services."}
