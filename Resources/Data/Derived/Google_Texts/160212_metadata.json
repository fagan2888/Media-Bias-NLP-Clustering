Maps, magazines, music, posters, books, and videos\u2014a never-ending hunt for history. It takes them across the globe, through war zones and political unrest, the types of places where it\u2019s best to blend in\u2014or occasionally travel in an armoured car. And they race to do it, hoping to snap up artifacts before they\u2019re lost or intentionally destroyed.\n\nAuthor Rachel Roubein is a Staff Correspondent at National Journal covering Congress. She previously covered health and human services at Carroll County Times in Westminster, Maryland, where she won awards for her Affordable Care Act coverage and state government, health and investigative reporting. ... Full Bio\n\nThese are not just any librarians.\n\nBut the employees of the Library of Congress\u2019s Overseas Offices don\u2019t have just any job. They\u2019re tasked with tracking down critical-yet-obscure materials from around the globe and bringing them stateside, all with the goal of making sure Congress\u2014and anyone else who wants to use its library\u2014has access to the world\u2019s most current and comprehensive collection of information.\n\nIt\u2019s not an esoteric pursuit. The material that the overseas offices send home are used by lawmakers and their staffs to help shape policy, and daily updates from the overseas offices are sent right into the inbox of some congressional staffers and the Congressional Research Service to quicken the flow of international information to Capitol Hill.\n\n\u201cFor Congress, it\u2019s a matter of helping them prepare legislation related to the areas,\u201d Beacher Wiggins, the library\u2019s acquisitions and bibliographic access director, said. \u201cIf there is a war going on, and if there is an increase in a request for funds, say from the White House, to send more troops to this area, we could have some firsthand information that Congress would not otherwise have because we have it in a local language, and Congress would have it immediately.\u201d\n\nThey\u2019ve been at it for half a century. In 1958, Congress permitted its library to establish locations overseas. Specifically, they\u2019re set up when research materials can\u2019t be retrieved any other way.\n\nThe library collects resources from just about every country and language; typically, acquisitions staff work with international vendors, who send materials to the library\u2019s Capitol Hill home. But this model doesn\u2019t work in areas without a robust infrastructure, or those ruled by regimes with little interest in sharing.\n\nAnd so the library sets up offices to find materials that couldn\u2019t be accessed otherwise. Twenty-three such offices were established from 1962 to 1986, yet slowly, many of these closed as the need for an office in that location diminished. The number has since been whittled down to six: New Delhi; Cairo; Rio de Janeiro; Islamabad; Jakarta, Indonesia; and Nairobi, Kenya.\n\nEach has a similar set-up. An American heads the office, but the rest of the staff, 216 in total, are locals\u2014and for a very distinct reason. \u201cWe need to have people on the ground because they\u2019re sensitive and insecure areas,\u201d Wiggins said. \u201cThey need to be local or native people of that culture so they can, one, blend in, they have connections, they are able to set up relationships that an American cannot do.\u201d\n\nThe local staff collect materials where they live. They go on acquisitions trips to gather more items. They pack and ship what they\u2019ve found not only to the Library of Congress but to national and international libraries, universities and research institutions through a pay-to-play program called the Cooperative Acquisitions Program. And sometimes, they establish a bibliographic representative in a nearby area who ships the goods to the overseas office for processing and packaging to the Library of Congress.\n\nA January, 2011 issue of an Iraqi daily newspaper is set out on a table of African and Middle Eastern Reading Room and Division; daily newspapers are items the Library of Congress\u2019 overseas offices collect.

But it\u2019s less dangerous for natives to go into unstable areas as they\u2019re more in tune with a community\u2019s customs. \u201cThey\u2019re pretty much OK,\u201d Wiggins said, \u201cbecause they\u2019re local, and they know the culture, and they know the language and they fit [in]. Whereas if we had an American staff there they wouldn\u2019t because they stand out like a sore thumb among the local and native.\u201d\n\nThe people on the ground work hard to get materials, which sometimes aren\u2019t sold by publishers or may be banned by the government, and that can mean taking risks to track them down. And the key formula is making connections and knowing where to look (like in the right marketplaces), according to Mary-Jane Deeb, chief of the library\u2019s African and Middle East Division.\n\n\u201cWe get materials that are so rare\u2014they don\u2019t need to be ancient to be rare\u2014they\u2019re modern and contemporary materials that Congress might need,\u201d Deeb said, \u201cbut they\u2019re difficult to get and the librarians go out there, and they get them.\u201d\n\nYet, because these regions can be prone to violence, the offices themselves need to be secured. Since most are inside the U.S. embassy compound, the library helps pay a fee for the local guards to protect the office and/or the home of the American director. But in areas with political unrest, extra precautions are taken: In Islamabad, the American director doesn\u2019t live in Pakistan, but flies to and from the country throughout the year to oversee the office. In Cairo, the office was closed to Americans for more than three months, and the director was ordered to stay in the United States until the region stabilized. And it shuttered again in 2013 for more than two weeks during the ouster and removal of President Mohamed Morsi (though local staff continued working during the closures).\n\nSometimes, historical documents are destroyed. Take Somalia. A civil war has plagued the region, and the country\u2019s written history in essence cannot be found inside Somalia, according to Abdulahi Ahmed, who works in the library\u2019s African and Middle Eastern Division.\n\nSo, when Ahmed, a Somali native, decided to coauthor a book detailing the history of Somali arts and plays before the 1991 civil war, he used the library\u2019s resources on the country, which the Nairobi office had collected. \u201cThe library saved Somalia,\u201d Ahmed said. \u201cEverything that was written about Somalia and written in Somalia, we have a copy here. You will not find it in any other place in the world. It\u2019s here.\u201d\n\nNow, Somalia is trying to rebuild its library in its capital, Mogadishu, and has asked the Library of Congress for help in bolstering a collection. And that is at the heart of what these offices exist to do.\n\n\u201cWe say the library is the world\u2019s memory. And especially now with all the turmoil going on in Africa and the Middle East,\u201d Deeb said, \u201cthe offices that provide those books are really doing a great service not only to the library and to Congress, but in the long run, to history because they\u2019re preserving the work created by people whose own heritage is being destroyed by war.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Rachel Roubein", "description": "Amid escalating violence in the Middle East and Africa, the Library of Congress is on a mission to secure history.", "og": {"site_name": "Defense One", "description": "Amid escalating violence in the Middle East and Africa, the Library of Congress is on a mission to secure history.", "title": "Meet The US Treasure Hunters Racing To Protect Artifacts From War", "url": "http://www.defenseone.com/politics/2015/04/meet-us-treasure-hunters-racing-protect-artifacts-war/110392/", "image": "http://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/upload/2015/04/16/8470008043_75a2c9e3b7_o/open-graph.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/upload/2015/04/16/8470008043_75a2c9e3b7_o/open-graph.jpg", "title": "Meet The US Treasure Hunters Racing To Protect Artifacts From War", "site": "@defenseone", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Amid escalating violence in the Middle East and Africa, the Library of Congress is on a mission to secure history."}, "sailthru.date": "2015-04-16T22:01:35Z", "sailthru.images.full": "http://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/upload/2015/04/16/8470008043_75a2c9e3b7_o.jpg", "sailthru.title": "Meet The US Treasure Hunters Racing To Protect Artifacts From War", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=758349913, app-argument=http://www.defenseone.com/politics/2015/04/meet-us-treasure-hunters-racing-protect-artifacts-war/110392/", "fb": {"admins": 1563600116}, "sailthru.images.thumb": "http://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/upload/2015/04/16/8470008043_75a2c9e3b7_o/sailthru-thumbnail.jpg", "keywords": "white house, middle east, islamic state, congress, 114th congress, kenya", "sailthru.tags": "white-house,middle-east,islamic-state,congress,114th-congress,kenya,channel-politics,type-story,length-long,site-defenseone", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/DefenseOne"}, "sailthru.description": "Amid escalating violence in the Middle East and Africa, the Library of Congress is on a mission to secure history.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThey\u2019re pretty much OK,\u201d Wiggins said, \u201cbecause they\u2019re local, and they know the culture, and they know the language and they fit [in].\nBut the employees of the Library of Congress\u2019s Overseas Offices don\u2019t have just any job.\nAnd it shuttered again in 2013 for more than two weeks during the ouster and removal of President Mohamed Morsi (though local staff continued working during the closures).\nThe material that the overseas offices send home are used by lawmakers and their staffs to help shape policy, and daily updates from the overseas offices are sent right into the inbox of some congressional staffers and the Congressional Research Service to quicken the flow of international information to Capitol Hill.\nAnd they race to do it, hoping to snap up artifacts before they\u2019re lost or intentionally destroyed."}
