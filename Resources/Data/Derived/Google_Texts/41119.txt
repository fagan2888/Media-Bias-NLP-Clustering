Documents & Reports

In January, state inspectors watched as a Lakeview staffer punched a teenaged boy with autism in the face. This is the statement of findings issued by the Bureau of Licensing & Certification after investigating the complaint that followed the incident:

Kathryn du Pree spent the last several months combing through confidential records and interviewing current and former staff from both the state and Lakeview Neurorehabilitation Center. Du Pree was hired by Governor Maggie Hassan's office to investigate Lakeview, the stateâ€™s oversight of the facility, and where that oversight has fallen short in the past.

The following documents are the two reports she generated:
