UPDATE SATURDAY 10:44 PM : Nathan Ross has been found, according to Herbert. Updates on his conditions will be made when they bring him to the command post.

CLAYTON (KRON) — 18-year-old Nathan Ross went up Mt. Diablo from the Clayton side Friday night and has not been seen since. He sent a text to a family member saying that he was being pursued by a mountain lion. He said he was below power lines and was trying to secure his safety. Ross has been out for approximately twenty-four hours. His family and authorities are concerned for his well being.

His mother, Lisa Ross said that the Mt. Diablo State Park PD and the Contra Costa County Search and Rescue team at Mitchell Canyon are conducting a search for Nathan.

“If he did something wrong we don’t care, we just want him home,” Lisa Ross said.

Contra Costa Lieutenant Ian Herbert confirmed the search for Nathan, but did not confirm that Ross was pursued by a mountain lion. KRON 4 will provide updates as the story develops.
