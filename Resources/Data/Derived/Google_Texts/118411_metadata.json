The former undersecretary was forced to resign after the Navy discovered evidence of an affair while investigating the silencer case. He is not a target of prosecutors, but other officials are.\n\n\u25cfThe Navy also is immersed in a scandal involving allegations that a Singapore-based defense contractor bribed senior officers with prostitutes, luxury travel and money.\n\n\u25cfIn the wake of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s HealthCare.gov rollout debacle, President Obama was frank: \u201cThe way the federal government does procurement and does IT is just generally not very efficient. In fact, there\u2019s probably no bigger gap between the private sector and the public sector than IT.\u201d\n\n\u25cfAn Army Corps of Engineers civilian was sentenced in July to 20 years in prison for his role as the ringleader of what the U.S. attorney for the District called \u201cthe largest bribery and bid-rigging scheme in the history of federal contracting.\u201d\n\nBut these cases are far from the complete story in the $500 billion world of federal procurement. They didn\u2019t stop Joe Jordan, who was administrator of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy at the Office of Management and Budget until Friday, from declaring that \u201cfederal procurement is in a great place.\u201d\n\nAs he prepared to leave his office, with a great view of the White House West Wing, Jordan paused to talk about federal contracting and procurement issues. He\u2019s proud of the drop in federal contract spending, from $539.5 billion in 2011 to $459.9 billion in 2013, while the percentage spent on small businesses increased.\n\n\u201cI feel very good about the state of contracting,\u201d he said.\n\nHe\u2019s leaving with praise for his personal accessibility from representatives of federal workers and federal contractors who don\u2019t like all the policies he advanced. Federal labor leaders don\u2019t think the administration has done enough to limit the contracting out of jobs they say federal employees should do. A contractor industry representative disagreed with his office over contractor compensation caps.\n\n\u201cJoe\u2019s been a good administrator,\u201d said Stan Soloway, president and chief executive of the Professional Services Council, which represents contractors. \u201cHe\u2019s been accessible, communicative and reasonable. Even when we\u2019ve had some policy disagreements, he did not shy away from productive dialogue.\u201d\n\nBefore joining the OMB in 2012, Jordan was with the Small Business Administration and the McKinsey & Co. consulting firm. As he returns to private industry, he represents the common revolving-door practice in Washington, where officials come and go between government and business, think tanks, academia or consulting companies.\n\nJordan, father to a baby girl, is leaving the government but not contracting. He\u2019s joining FedBid, which facilitates transactions between the government and private companies. The firm\u2019s news release announcing Jordan\u2019s role as president of public sector says that he will \u201chelp grow and manage FedBid\u2019s Federal Buyer base.\u201d\n\nJordan said he discussed his move with the OMB\u2019s ethics officer, complied with all laws and regulations, and is confident there is no conflict of interest. Since November, he has been recused from \u201cany policy having a direct or material or financial interest [with] my future employer.\u201d\n\nAs a FedBid employee, Jordan said, he will help companies buy goods on the online marketplace, but \u201cI won\u2019t be lobbying the executive branch. I won\u2019t have any professional dealings affecting my employer with the Executive Office of the President \u2014 any of those types of things,\u201d he said.\n\nJust before his security-clearance debriefing, Jordan spoke about several federal contracting and procurement issues:\n\nThe acquisition workforce. When Obama administration officials took over, they complained that while contracting out for government services increased greatly under the previous administration, the acquisition workforce did not. Since then, the 30,000 contracting officers at the end of the George W. Bush administration have grown to almost 37,000, which Jordan says is about the right number.\n\nAbout one-third of them, however, have four years\u2019 experience or less, so they are still learning the complex field of government procurement. Another third have 20 years\u2019 experience or more, so they are nearing retirement age.\n\nWithin budget constraints, online training and other forms of education have increased. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to make sure they have the tools,\u201d Jordan said.\n\nContracting procedures. Jordan agrees with the congressional moratorium on a contracting-out process known as A-76, because he says it uses flawed methodology. A-76 looks at work done by federal employees to determine if the jobs could be done more cost-effectively by contractors.\n\nInsourcing \u2014 taking back work from contractors so federal staffers can do it. \u201cInsourcing certainly should be looked at where you have . . . an inherently governmental function or something that is critical,\u201d Jordan said. Beyond those inherently governmental functions, agencies also should look at bringing inside projects for \u201cclear cost reasons,\u201d he added, but that \u201cisn\u2019t yet something that we want to force agencies to do or push any harder than our current guidance, but we\u2019ve got good guidance.\u201d\n\nThe American Federation of Government Employees has often been at odds with Obama administration contracting policies and was much more so with the Bush administration\u2019s. After John Threlkeld, the AFGE\u2019s assistant legislative director, listed a series of issues with Obama administration contractor and procurement policies, he ended with praise for Jordan.\n\n\u201cWe will very much miss Mr. Jordan,\u201d Threlkeld said. \u201cHe inherited bad policies, but was always gracious and accessible in his interactions with AFGE.\u201d\n\nTwitter: @JoeDavidsonWP\n\nPrevious columns by Joe Davidson are available at wapo.st/JoeDavidson.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "federal employees, federal diary, Joe Davidson, federal procurement, federal contracting, Navy, scandal, Office of Federal Procurement Policy, Office of Mangement and Budget, OMB, Professional Services Council, PSC, American Federation of Government Employees: AFGE", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Top Obama contracting official leaves for position with firm that facilitates fedeal procurement.", "title": "Top contractor official leaves as contracting out falls and contracting officers increase", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/federal_government/top-contractor-official-leaves-as-contracting-out-falls-and-contracting-officers-increase/2014/01/19/4a01d612-7f9e-11e3-9556-4a4bf7bcbd84_story.html", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=https://img.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-3000x1568.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/federal_government/top-contractor-official-leaves-as-contracting-out-falls-and-contracting-officers-increase/2014/01/19/4a01d612-7f9e-11e3-9556-4a4bf7bcbd84_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "federal employees, federal diary, Joe Davidson, federal procurement, federal contracting, Navy, scandal, Office of Federal Procurement Policy, Office of Mangement and Budget, OMB, Professional Services Council, PSC, American Federation of Government Employees: AFGE", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "eomportal-uuid": "4a01d612-7f9e-11e3-9556-4a4bf7bcbd84", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "description": "Top Obama contracting official leaves for position with firm that facilitates fedeal procurement."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe20a1\"", "article_summary": "After John Threlkeld, the AFGE\u2019s assistant legislative director, listed a series of issues with Obama administration contractor and procurement policies, he ended with praise for Jordan.\nJust before his security-clearance debriefing, Jordan spoke about several federal contracting and procurement issues:The acquisition workforce.\nFederal procurement has taken a beating in recent months.\nWhen Obama administration officials took over, they complained that while contracting out for government services increased greatly under the previous administration, the acquisition workforce did not.\nA contractor industry representative disagreed with his office over contractor compensation caps."}
