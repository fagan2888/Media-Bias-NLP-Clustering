Obamacare Slaps 'Insane' Deductible on Texas Family's Healthcare

KTBS-TV reports on the plight of the Schmidt family of Texas. Both face surgery and rising insurance premiums from their private health insurance carrier. They worked two computers to find a new plan under Obamacare at Healthcare.gov. They hoped to save money.

Obamacare offered them a plan that did have a lower premium, but the overall cost is much higher. Out-of-pocket costs skyrocket, and the deductible jumped to an extremely pricey $12,700.

"This is insane," Robert Schmidt told KTBS. "The deductible has gone crazy. $12,700 deductible. That's...a lot of money." Their current plan offers 100% coverage, so they plan to stick with it.
