A Chicago man was brutally gunned down on a street corner Thursday while live-streaming video of himself on Facebook.

A purported video of the shooting shared on social media showed the victim standing in front of a corner store in Chicago’s South Side, talking into the camera as music played in the background. As shots fired, the victim’s camera fell to the ground and a man in black long sleeves can be seen repeatedly firing his handgun. At least 16 shots are heard in the video.

The shooting took place about 4:45 p.m. in the 5800 block of South Hoyne Avenue, Chicago Police Officer Thomas Sweeney told BuzzFeed News. A suspect approached the 31-year-old man, shot him multiple times, then fled in a vehicle, the officer said.

The victim was taken to a hospital, where as of Thursday night, he remained in treatment, BuzzFeed reported.

The video filmed the sky in silence for a brief period as the victim lay on the ground. People can then be heard screaming and crying in the background before the video cut out.

“Oh my god, no!” a woman sobbed.

Officer Sweeney said police have been made aware of the video and are investigating its authenticity.
