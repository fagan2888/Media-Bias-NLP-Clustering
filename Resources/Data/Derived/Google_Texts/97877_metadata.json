Israel has vowed to exact a heavy price from Hamas, saying the aim of the military operation goes beyond searching for the boys.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu convened his Security Cabinet, a group of senior government ministers, to discuss the crisis. During the three-hour meeting, the ministers agreed to worsen the conditions of Hamas prisoners Israel is holding, said an official familiar with the deliberations.\n\nHe would not elaborate, saying only that the operation to return the missing teens \u201ccontinues and will be intensified.\u201d He spoke on condition of anonymity because the meeting was held behind closed doors.\n\nThe crisis has exacerbated already tense relations between Israel and the Palestinian government following the recent collapse of peace talks. Netanyahu has used the abduction to try to discredit Western-backed Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and the unity government Abbas formed with Hamas backing earlier this month. Israel has blamed Hamas for the apparent abductions, though it has not provided proof.\n\nNetanyahu has expressed disappointment with what he considers to be a tepid international response to the kidnappings.\n\nOn Tuesday, he called on the international community to condemn Hamas, to support Israel\u2019s right to defend itself and to press Abbas \u201cto end his pact with Hamas.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnybody who supports peace must tell the Palestinian Authority that they cannot build a government that is backed by the kidnappers of children and the murderers of innocents,\u201d Netanyahu said at a meeting with international Mideast envoy Tony Blair.\n\nAbbas formed the unity government early this month to end a seven-year rift with Hamas. The Cabinet consists of Abbas loyalists, but Hamas has agreed to support it from the outside.\n\nTuesday\u2019s arrests took place around the northern West Bank city of Nablus, far from the southern city of Hebron, which has been the focus of the army\u2019s search so far. Israeli forces continued to restrict the movement of Palestinians around Hebron.\n\nThe army said it found hundreds of weapons and explosives in Nablus. It posted photos online of bullets, grenades, guns and other weapons it said it found.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Israel leader wants world pressure on Palestinians", "title": "Israel leader wants world pressure on Palestinians", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Israel leader wants world pressure on Palestinians", "title": "Israel leader wants world pressure on Palestinians", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/06/17/israel_leader_wants_world_pressure_on_palestinians/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/mideast-israel-palestinians.jpeg2-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Israel leader wants world pressure on Palestinians", "title": "Israel leader wants world pressure on Palestinians", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/mideast-israel-palestinians.jpeg2-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Daniel Estrin", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The crisis has exacerbated already tense relations between Israel and the Palestinian government following the recent collapse of peace talks.\nDuring the three-hour meeting, the ministers agreed to worsen the conditions of Hamas prisoners Israel is holding, said an official familiar with the deliberations.\nIsrael has vowed to exact a heavy price from Hamas, saying the aim of the military operation goes beyond searching for the boys.\nIsrael has blamed Hamas for the apparent abductions, though it has not provided proof.\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu convened his Security Cabinet, a group of senior government ministers, to discuss the crisis."}
