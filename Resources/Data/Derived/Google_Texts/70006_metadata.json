Mike Edmonson announced Friday night. The other two officers involved are Sgt. Kenneth Parnell and Lt. Jason Brouillette of the Marksville Police Department. All four were placed on administrative leave following Tuesday's chase.\n\nThe events that led to the car chase and shooting are still unclear and are pending investigation by Louisiana State Police. However, citing the police body-camera footage of the episode, Edmonson said, \"It is one of the most disturbing scenes I have seen.\"\n\nAccording to The (Baton Rouge) Advocate, Edmonson said Thursday there is no evidence that Few had a weapon in his car.\n\nTwo of the four officers have refused to speak to authorities, but Edmonson declined to say which police officers remained silent.\n\nThe Associated Press adds:\n\n\"The parish coroner said earlier this week that the officers were serving a warrant on Few when he fled, but Edmonson later said he had no information about a warrant. \"Few's 57-year-old stepfather, Morris German, has accused the marshals of indiscriminately opening fire on the vehicle. German said Few was heavily sedated, unable to talk and has bullet fragments lodged in his brain and lung. He described Few as a loving father and added the man's son 'was his whole life.' \"\n\nJeremy Mardis, a first-grader with autism, is the youngest police-shooting victim this year.", "article_metadata": {"Rating": "General", "description": "Two of four local deputies involved in a shooting in Marksville, La., are charged with second-degree murder.
