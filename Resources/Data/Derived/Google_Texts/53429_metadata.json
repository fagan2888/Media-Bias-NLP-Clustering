Yes, there are lots of good answers, but if you ask me, it has something to do with this: one person, one vote.\n\nIt\u2019s a pretty simple phrase, but in it lies the promise that no matter who you are, or where you come from, when the rubber hits the road your voice is worth just as much as anyone else\u2019s. You have a say. And no one else\u2019s say is more important than yours.\n\nBut for that to work, every citizen in good standing has to have a meaningful opportunity to participate in the process. And the question before us today is: Is that getting easier or harder, and which option is more consistent with our concept of American democracy?\n\n[Views You Can Use: Did the Supreme Court hurt or help democracy?]\n\nTake a look at cases like Citizens United and, this week, McCutcheon, for example. They do one thing: give the very wealthy more influence over elections in the United States. It\u2019s like saying: instead of an electoral process where everyone\u2019s voice is given the same weight, some people, by virtue of their wealth, are going to get megaphones. Yes, that\u2019s been true, in one way or another, for years, but in its recent rulings the Supreme Court\u2019s been busy making those megaphones even louder.\n\nSomething similar is happening on the state level, if only from a different direction. You can see it in the tougher voter ID requirements, the diminution of early voting, law after law aimed at making it harder for some people to vote \u2013 in this case, people who just happen to be more likely to vote Democratic. The end result is an electorate with an artificially higher concentration of conservative voters. Terrific for Republicans. Less good for democracy.\n\nTake the federal and state efforts together and it\u2019s a kind of a pincer movement aimed at producing a \u201crepresentative\u201d government that\u2019s actually a lot more conservative than its constituents, a representative government that\u2019s not really all that, you know, representative.\n\n[Read political scientist Bert Johnson on why McCutcheon is worse than Citizens United.]\n\nThis is what happens when one segment of the population says: We\u2019ve been losing too much and we're sick of it. But instead of retooling our arguments to better match where the American electorate is, or trusting in the traditional American way of persuading a skeptical audience, we\u2019re instead going to lift the hood on the democratic process itself and see if we can change the system so that outcomes we prefer become more likely \u2013 not because they are more representative of the American people but because we\u2019ve figured out how to get a few more of our fingers on the electoral scale.\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing: being a good loser is, actually, an essential part of the American system. Every few years, we expect our politics to spit out a government that roughly reflects the priorities and interests of a majority of its citizens, because we all get to participate in the process equally. We may not like what that government looks like, but we don\u2019t go storming across the Rubicon, angry pitchforks in hand because the inclusiveness of the process gives it a kind of legitimacy that you don\u2019t find in a lot of other places. We live with it because we know it basically reflects the views of our peers (as opposed to: some remote cabal) and because we'll have a meaningful opportunity to change it next time around.\n\nAnd the fact of the matter is: its good for the process when someone loses on the merits. Because losing fair and square encourages the loser to stop regurgitating the same losing arguments over and over again, and instead to come up with something better. Isn\u2019t that what we want the competition of ideas that plays out in every election to produce? Or are we instead going to stand by and let the sorest of the losers say: If I can\u2019t win the game as its supposed to be played I\u2019m going change the game, and I don\u2019t much care if doing so undermines one of the very things that makes America a beacon of liberty in an increasingly Putinized world.\n\n[Vote: Was the Supreme Court right to strike down campaign finance limits?]\n\nOf course, it isn\u2019t entirely up to us, but that\u2019s what happens when the Supreme Court steps in. For me, that only increases the urgency of the following question: is there a point at which changing the nature of electoral inputs, either by giving some outsized influence over the process or making it harder for others to participate at all, gets so out of whack that it begins to undermine the legitimacy of electoral outcomes? If you really love America qua America, you know that's a place we should never be.\n\nNo we\u2019re not there yet.", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Thomas Jefferson Street [Opinion]", "title": "McCutcheon, Citizens United and the Revenge of the Sore Losers", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "How McCutcheon, Citizens United and voting restrictions are hurting our democracy.", "title": "The Politics of Losing Sorely", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/anson-kaye/2014/04/04/mccutcheon-citizens-united-and-the-revenge-of-the-sore-losers", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/1f/fc/dc723b4a4bc89868fd8bc81c0218/20140402edwas-a.tif", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@USNews", "description": "How McCutcheon, Citizens United and voting restrictions are hurting our democracy.", "card": "summary", "title": "McCutcheon, Citizens United and the Revenge of the Sore Losers"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "opinion", "date_published": "April 4, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Anson Kaye,Citizens United,Supreme Court,campaign finance,politics,elections,presidential elections,picks,Thomas Jefferson Street [Opinion]", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "How McCutcheon, Citizens United and voting restrictions are hurting our democracy."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc3ef\"", "article_summary": "Take a look at cases like Citizens United and, this week, McCutcheon, for example.\nIf you really love America qua America, you know that's a place we should never be.\n[Read political scientist Bert Johnson on why McCutcheon is worse than Citizens United.]\nBut for that to work, every citizen in good standing has to have a meaningful opportunity to participate in the process.\nSo let\u2019s get right down to it: when you really think about it, what makes America different from other countries?"}
