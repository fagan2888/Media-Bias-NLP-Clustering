In addition to serving as a trusted adviser to her husband, and an elegant hostess for our nation, she was a passionate advocate for issues that touched the lives of so many.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAfter her husband was diagnosed with Alzheimer\u2019s in 1994, Nancy Reagan became an active supporter of efforts to combat the disease.\n\n\u201cThe American people were deeply moved by the love Nancy felt for her husband,\u201d Obama continued. \u201cAnd we were inspired by how, in their long goodbye, Nancy became a voice on behalf of millions of families experiencing the depleting, aching reality of Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe brought her characteristic intelligence and focus to the twin causes of stem cell research and Alzheimer\u2019s research. And when I signed an order to resume federal stem cell research, I was proud that she was one of the first phone calls I made. Nobody understood better than Nancy Reagan the importance of pursuing treatments that hold the potential and the promise to improve and save lives.\u201d\n\nObama drew criticism this week for not attending Reagan\u2019s funeral on Friday. Instead he spoke at the annual South by Southwest conference in Austin, Texas.\n\nStill, he had high praise for the former first lady and called on the country to help further her healthcare efforts.\n\n\u201cThanks to the tireless efforts of people like Nancy Reagan, I\u2019ve never been more optimistic that we are getting closer to the day when every single patient can get the care they need and deserve,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve never been more optimistic that we will one day find a cure for devastating diseases like Alzheimer\u2019s. And I can think of no better way to honor our former first lady\u2019s legacy than by working together, as one nation, toward that goal.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The president celebrated Reagan's contributions to stem cell and Alzheimer's disease research.", "description": "The president celebrated Reagan's contributions to stem cell and Alzheimer's disease research.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Blog Briefing Room"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The president celebrated Reagan's contributions to stem cell and Alzheimer's disease research.", "title": "Obama praises Nancy Reagan for devotion to fighting Alzheimer's", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/272755-obama-praises-nancy-reagan-for-devotion-to-stem-cell-research-and-fighting", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/obamabarack02222016getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-03-12T07:17:05-05:00", "type": "article"}, "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-03-12T07:17-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/272755-obama-praises-nancy-reagan-for-devotion-to-stem-cell-research-and-fighting", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "dcterms.date": "2016-03-12T06:00-05:00", "dcterms.creator": "Harper Neidig", "author": "Harper Neidig", "dcterms.type": "Text", "article": {"published_time": "2016-03-12T06:00:03-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-12T07:17:05-05:00"}, "keywords": "Alzheimer's disease,Nancy Reagan, Barack Obama, Ronald Reagan,", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/272755-obama-praises-nancy-reagan-for-devotion-to-stem-cell-research-and-fighting", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The president celebrated Reagan's contributions to stem cell and Alzheimer's disease research.", "card": "summary", "title": "Obama praises Nancy Reagan for devotion to fighting Alzheimer's"}, "dcterms.title": "Obama praises Nancy Reagan for devotion to fighting Alzheimer's"}, "article_summary": "President Obama on Saturday eulogized former first lady Nancy Reagan in his weekly address, praising her for her commitment to stem cell research and fighting Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\nADVERTISEMENTAfter her husband was diagnosed with Alzheimer\u2019s in 1994, Nancy Reagan became an active supporter of efforts to combat the disease.\n\u201cAs President, I know just how important it is to have a strong life partner, and President Reagan was as lucky as I am,\u201d Obama said.\n\u201cThe American people were deeply moved by the love Nancy felt for her husband,\u201d Obama continued.\n\u201cNancy Reagan redefined the role of first lady of the United States."}
