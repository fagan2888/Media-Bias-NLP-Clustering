There\u2019s a lot of places, still, where the USGS especially doesn\u2019t have seismographs, and where it can fail to detect earthquakes as quickly as it would like. So, to state things somewhat cynically, it\u2019s turned to a new kind of networked sensor of local experience: humans.\n\nAs the historian Paul N. Edwards details in his book A Vast Machine , the global scientific-sensor network for weather alone took more than a century to build, the culmination of political, economic, and scientific human collaboration.\n\nThe world is covered in sensors. Thermometers, barometers, seismometers. When joined together, they have incredible capabilities: Through its global network of seismographs, the United States Geological Service detects earthquakes as they happen, estimates their reach and destruction, and can even warn civilian authorities of what might be on the way.\n\nAccording to a Twitter blog post on Wednesday, the USGS has begun to augment its seismological data with a real-time feed of tweets. The social-network data helps fill in holes in the agency\u2019s sensor network and check for false alarms. (The seismic network senses as many as 70 earthquakes per day, but many of them are not felt by anyone at ground-level.)\n\nTwitter confirmation of an earthquake can often come very fast, especially in technology-dense areas. When a magnitude-6.0 quake hit Napa, California, in August 2014, the USGS\u2019s scripts confirmed the quake was real less than 90 seconds after it began. It of course helps that Twitter use is common in northern California\u2014but then again, so are earthquakes.\n\nWhen combing Twitter for earthquake news, the agency\u2019s scripts look for people writing short. At first, the USGS just searched for people tweeting \u201cearthquake,\u201d which gave them a useful if very noisy feed. Then they started to hone their search, according to Twitter\u2019s blog post: They found that people posting that they had just experienced an earthquake tended to keep their tweets brief. Also, if someone included numbers or a link in their tweet, that tended to mean they were far away from the quake\u2014distant enough to tweet an earthquake event in comfortable detail.\n\nThe kind of tweets that the USGS pulls in, in other words, look like this:\n\nJust felt an earthquake here in Napa. \u2014 David Biggar (@DavidNBCLA) April 4, 2014\n\nAnd not like this, for instance, from Atlantic contributing editor Alexis Madrigal:\n\nMan, 6.0 earthquake up in Napa. Certainly felt legit here in Oakland. http://t.co/rVO4pltH9q \u2014 Alexis C. Madrigal (@alexismadrigal) August 24, 2014\n\nFor comparison, 90 seconds is an extremely fast notification for an earthquake. While the government and a consortium of West Coast universities operate an early-warning system that functions very well\u2014for the 2014 Napa quake, it correctly warned lab technicians in Berkeley 10 seconds before shaking began\u2014it needs more funding before it can be implemented en masse. Until then, existing systems work at about the same speed as Twitter. When a 4.4-magnitude earthquake hit Los Angeles in March 2014, the USGS did not issue an alert until 90 seconds after the tremor began (though, again, the beta early-warning system knew what was happening much earlier). And the Los Angeles Times, which operates an algorithmic earthquake-story-writing program, did not post a story until eight minutes afterward.\n\nI\u2019ve reached out to the USGS to confirm their interest in Twitter but haven\u2019t heard back yet.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Robinson Meyer", "description": "The agency learned to separate background noise from the \u201cwow, that was an earthquake!\u201d tweet.", "og": {"site_name": "Government Executive", "description": "The agency learned to separate background noise from the \u201cwow, that was an earthquake!\u201d tweet.", "title": "How the USGS Detects Earthquakes Using Twitter", "url": "http://www.govexec.com/management/2015/10/how-usgs-detects-earthquakes-using-twitter/122715/", "image": "http://cdn.govexec.com/media/img/upload/2015/10/09/100915earthquake.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://cdn.govexec.com/media/img/upload/2015/10/09/100915earthquake/open-graph.jpg", "description": "The agency learned to separate background noise from the \u201cwow, that was an earthquake!\u201d tweet.", "site": "@govexec", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "How the USGS Detects Earthquakes Using Twitter"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-10-09T21:00:00Z", "sailthru.images.full": "http://cdn.govexec.com/media/img/upload/2015/10/09/100915earthquake.jpg", "sailthru.title": "How the USGS Detects Earthquakes Using Twitter", "keywords": "twitter, usgs", "fb": {"admins": 578600878}, "sailthru.images.thumb": "http://cdn.govexec.com/media/img/upload/2015/10/09/100915earthquake/sailthru-thumbnail.jpg", "sailthru.tags": "twitter,channel-management,type-story,length-medium,site-govexec", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/GovernmentExecutive"}, "sailthru.description": "The agency learned to separate background noise from the \u201cwow, that was an earthquake!\u201d tweet."}, "article_summary": "According to a Twitter blog post on Wednesday, the USGS has begun to augment its seismological data with a real-time feed of tweets.\nI\u2019ve reached out to the USGS to confirm their interest in Twitter but haven\u2019t heard back yet.\nThe kind of tweets that the USGS pulls in, in other words, look like this:Just felt an earthquake here in Napa.\nIt of course helps that Twitter use is common in northern California\u2014but then again, so are earthquakes.\nThere\u2019s a lot of places, still, where the USGS especially doesn\u2019t have seismographs, and where it can fail to detect earthquakes as quickly as it would like."}
