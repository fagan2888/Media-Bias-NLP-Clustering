I played for rival Buena High in Sierra Vista. Really, though, we were the Raiders to their Broncos, our victories few and far between.\n\nStill, toward the end of what had been a rough senior season, we were bidding for a road upset late in the fourth quarter when Tucson began a two-on-one fast break \u2014 with me as the lone defender. The Tucson guard lofted the ball toward the rim for Kay, and I thought I could reach it. Instead, I just ended up on the wrong end of a poster slam.\n\nUpset bid over.\n\nOne week later, Kay had another memorable dunk, this one a breakaway in the closing seconds to help Tucson beat an even bigger rival, Salpointe Catholic.\n\nBut it\u2019s what happened next that had me thinking about Kay when Arizona coach Sean Miller on Wednesday night decried another court-storming against his team, this time at the Coors Events Center in Boulder.\n\nAs the Tucson fans rushed the court on that February day 12 years ago, Kay was knocked to the ground and trampled. He suffered a torn carotid artery and a stroke, and he was paralyzed on the right side of his body.\n\nWhile Miller envisions a scenario in which an Arizona player will someday punch a fan in self-defense \u2014 and that surely would be an ugly postgame scene \u2014 I always think of darker possibilities when a mass of students hurriedly jams into a hardwood box that is 94 feet by 50.\n\nI think of Kay.\n\n\u201cGranted, I was small potatoes, a high school player in Tucson,\u201d Kay told ESPN\u2019s \u201cOutside the Lines\u201d in 2013, \u201cbut it seems nothing was learned.\u201d\n\nI admired Kay when I played against him. He could leap out of the gym \u2014 he had signed to play volleyball at Stanford \u2014 and had an unrelenting motor. And it was all taken away for a few fleeting moments of, well, what exactly? Fun?\n\nThankfully, Kay regained the ability to walk and graduated from Stanford before pursuing a graduate degree at Arizona State, but many of his physical gifts were snatched away that day.\n\nI fear Kay\u2019s ordeal will be repeated if the NCAA, or individual schools and conferences, don\u2019t make a greater effort to keep players, coaches and spectators safe.\n\nThis season, veteran Des Moines Register reporter Randy Peterson suffered a fractured fibula and tibia when he was knocked to the ground by court-storming Iowa State students after the Cyclones\u2019 victory over Iowa.\n\nIowa State\u2019s response left plenty to be desired.\n\n\u201cI hate that Randy got hurt,\u201d Iowa State coach Steve Prohm told the Register. \u201cThat\u2019s terrible. But, my thing, I was trying to go see my wife, to be honest with you. It was a great moment. That\u2019s part of college basketball.\u201d\n\nRisk of serious injury after a game shouldn\u2019t be part of any college sport.\n\nMiller has a fair suggestion. Allow just a few moments for the losing team to leave the court before fans pile onto it. I get it, some of the spontaneity of the moment would be taken away. But, really, isn\u2019t that a small price to pay to curb potentially tragic incidents?\n\nAfter all, I\u2019d rather get dunked on 100 more times than not see us learn from what happened to Joe Kay.\n\nNick Kosmider: 303-954-1516, nkosmider @denverpost.com or @nickkosmider", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Kosmider: Rushing the floor in college basketball poses too many risks", "title": "Kosmider: Rushing the floor in college basketball poses too many risks", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/02/27/kosmider-rushing-the-floor-in-college-basketball-poses-too-many-risks/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160227__cb3cc4f724a06d0a910f6a706700aa34p1.jpg", "height": 432}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160227__cb3cc4f724a06d0a910f6a706700aa34p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2016-02-27T14:54:17+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-18T02:14:08+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Kay was a 6-foot-6 standout basketball player for Tucson High School in 2004.\nThat\u2019s part of college basketball.\u201dRisk of serious injury after a game shouldn\u2019t be part of any college sport.\n\u201cGranted, I was small potatoes, a high school player in Tucson,\u201d Kay told ESPN\u2019s \u201cOutside the Lines\u201d in 2013, \u201cbut it seems nothing was learned.\u201dI admired Kay when I played against him.\nThe Tucson guard lofted the ball toward the rim for Kay, and I thought I could reach it.\nAfter all, I\u2019d rather get dunked on 100 more times than not see us learn from what happened to Joe Kay."}
