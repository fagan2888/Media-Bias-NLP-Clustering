Open enrollment continues through Feb. 15.\n\nAfter opening at 8 a.m. Saturday, quality-control monitors in the Healthfinder system noticed that consumers\u2019 tax credits were being computed incorrectly. Rather than continue service and fix the errors in consumer accounts later, officials decided to bring the site down and fix it.\n\nThe tax-credit calculations are important in helping users determine how much a health plan will cost them. Based on an applicant\u2019s income level, the credits go toward making premium payments more affordable for those who qualify.\n\nIn a statement Sunday morning, the exchange said the miscalculation affected fewer than 800 customers, including nearly 150 customers who scheduled payments based on that information. The exchange will be contacting those customers individually to notify them of the corrected figures.\n\nMichael Marchand, communications director of the exchange, said the inaccurate calculations involved links with the state Department of Social and Health Services\u2019 database, which confirms eligibility on Healthplanfinder. The DSHS eligibility system was using 2014 rather than 2015 federal poverty level tables to calculate the credits. \u201cThe system wasn\u2019t set up to point to the 2015 pivot table until 2015 because we\u2019re still in calendar year 2014,\u201d Marchand said.\n\nRequests for comment from DSHS have not been returned.\n\nAdditionally, in the course of fixing the problem, the technical staff discovered an error in the Healthplanfinder tax credit formula. Frey said this error has also been fixed.\n\nSite users also face outages from scheduled maintenance shutdowns. In fact, the exchange had scheduled maintenance on Saturday and Sunday night of the first weekend of open enrollment.\n\nMarchand, said nearly all of the scheduled maintenance outages are imposed by other state or federal agencies. He noted that there are many agencies involved in the processing of eligibility information \u2014- from the IRS to the Social Security Administration and the Department of Veterans Affairs \u2014 and if one of their systems is down for maintenance, the entire system is on hold.\n\n\u201cCould the IRS do work when Social Security is doing work?\u201d he said. \u201cIt would just make life easier to have one downtime.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"t_omni_path": "st|health|healthcarecheckup|article", "description": "UPDATE, Monday, 6:30 a.m. | The Washington Healthplanfinder site was down Sunday night to Monday morning while the Department of Social and Health Services did weekly maintenance to their eligibility service, said Bethany Frey, spokeswoman for the Washington Healthplanfinder.
