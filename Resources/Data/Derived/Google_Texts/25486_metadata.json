And in so do\u00ading, it en\u00adsured that the white-hot con\u00adtro\u00adversy over be\u00adne\u00adfits will not go away any time soon.\n\nThe om\u00adni\u00adbus spend\u00ading bill re\u00admoved some re\u00adduc\u00adtions to med\u00adic\u00adally re\u00adtired vet\u00ader\u00adans\u2019 re\u00adtire\u00adment be\u00adne\u00adfits, but that was a small part \u2014 less than one-tenth \u2014 of the $6 bil\u00adlion-plus cut in\u00adcluded in the Decem\u00adber budget deal. And that res\u00adtor\u00ada\u00adtion won\u2019t be enough for the out\u00adside vet\u00ader\u00adans groups, who have launched an all-out ef\u00adfort to re\u00adverse the cuts and have vowed to keep fight\u00ading un\u00adtil all the fund\u00ading is re\u00adstored.\n\nVet\u00ader\u00adans yield polit\u00adic\u00adal clout, and after an end\u00adless string of state\u00adments pledging to \u201csup\u00adport our troops,\u201d law\u00admakers are loathe to have crossed them. And so the re\u00adpeal ef\u00adfort is gain\u00ading trac\u00adtion: The Hill es\u00adtim\u00adates that one-third of law\u00admakers have backed a pro\u00adpos\u00adal to re\u00adverse the COLA cuts to work\u00ading-age mil\u00adit\u00adary re\u00adtir\u00adees in\u00adcluded in last month\u2019s deal.\n\nBut in a budget con\u00adstrained en\u00advir\u00adon\u00adment, the money to re\u00adverse the cuts has to come from some\u00adwhere, and that\u2019s where the unity shat\u00adters. Here are some of the pro\u00adpos\u00adals.\n\nAdding to the De\u00adfi\u00adcit: Simply re\u00adpeal\u00ading the cuts and let\u00adting the spend\u00ading add to the de\u00adfi\u00adcit is thus far the solu\u00adtion that has been pro\u00adposed the most. In the up\u00adper cham\u00adber, Sens. Kay Hagan and Mark Pry\u00ador have in\u00adtro\u00adduced le\u00adgis\u00adla\u00adtion to re\u00adpeal, while in the House, Reps. Robert Wittman, Jeff Miller, and Ju\u00adlia Brown\u00adley have in\u00adtro\u00adduced sim\u00adil\u00adar le\u00adgis\u00adla\u00adtion.\n\nWrap It In\u00adto a Lar\u00adger Vet\u00ader\u00adans Bill: The latest pro\u00adpos\u00adal to re\u00adverse the cuts comes from Sen. Bernie Sanders. Sanders in\u00adtro\u00adduced an om\u00adni\u00adbus vet\u00ader\u00adans bill Thursday even\u00ading that deals with a whole swath of is\u00adsues from restor\u00ading the COLA cuts to ex\u00adpand\u00ading schol\u00adar\u00adship funds. And it looks like it could have mo\u00admentum. Sen\u00adate Ma\u00adjor\u00adity Lead\u00ader Harry Re\u00adid is ex\u00adpec\u00adted to file the le\u00adgis\u00adla\u00adtion un\u00adder Rule 14, al\u00adlow\u00ading it to skip the com\u00admit\u00adtee pro\u00adcess.\n\nTax Changes: Sen. Jeanne Shaheen and Rep. Dan Maf\u00adfei have in\u00adtro\u00adduced le\u00adgis\u00adla\u00adtion to swap the roughly $6 bil\u00adlion in cuts with a clos\u00ading of a tax loop\u00adhole for off\u00adshore cor\u00adpor\u00ada\u00adtions.\n\nBut tax re\u00adform \u2014 while sup\u00adpor\u00adted gen\u00ader\u00adally by both parties \u2014 is typ\u00adic\u00adally more pop\u00adu\u00adlar in the\u00adory than prac\u00adtice, and it has faced a ser\u00adi\u00adous up\u00adhill chal\u00adlenge. Shaheen, however, has noted that she is will\u00ading to be \u201cflex\u00adible\u201d on how she off\u00adsets re\u00advers\u00ading the COLA cuts.\n\nUn\u00addoc\u00adu\u00admented Im\u00admig\u00adrants: Rep. Mike Fitzpatrick is tak\u00ading a dif\u00adfer\u00adent ap\u00adproach\u00ading, press\u00ading to re\u00adverse the COLA cuts by in\u00adcreas\u00ading re\u00adquire\u00adments to re\u00adceive the Re\u00adfund\u00adable Child Tax Cred\u00adit. The Pennsylvania Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adan wants to pre\u00advent un\u00addoc\u00adu\u00admented im\u00admig\u00adrants from be\u00ading able to claim the cred\u00adit.\n\nSen. Kelly Ayotte has in\u00adtro\u00adduced sim\u00adil\u00adar le\u00adgis\u00adla\u00adtion in the Sen\u00adate. Her pro\u00adpos\u00adal got a mo\u00adment\u00adary boost when Armed Ser\u00advice Com\u00admit\u00adtee Chair\u00adman Carl Lev\u00adin told re\u00adport\u00aders he would sup\u00adport her bill, but his of\u00adfice quickly re\u00adtrac\u00adted his state\u00adment, say\u00ading the sen\u00adat\u00ador didn\u2019t real\u00adize it was off\u00adset by tar\u00adget\u00ading un\u00addoc\u00adu\u00admented im\u00admig\u00adrants.\n\nBlock\u00ading For\u00adeign Aid: Rep. Ted Poe wants to re\u00adverse cuts by block\u00ading for\u00adeign aid to Egypt or Pakistan. His at\u00adtempt goes against the om\u00adni\u00adbus bill which would al\u00adlow the Obama ad\u00admin\u00adis\u00adtra\u00adtion to re\u00adsume more than $1 bil\u00adlion in aid to Egypt.\n\nAnd it isn\u2019t the first time Poe has tried to block for\u00adeign aid to Pakistan. When many of the armed-ser\u00advices branches, as well as the Coast Guard, sus\u00adpen\u00added their tu\u00adition as\u00adsist\u00adance pro\u00adgrams, Poe sug\u00adges\u00adted sus\u00adpend\u00ading aid to Pakistan un\u00adtil the pro\u00adgrams were fully fun\u00added, des\u00adpite the sig\u00adni\u00adfic\u00adant dif\u00adfer\u00adence in spend\u00ading both pro\u00adgrams re\u00adquire.\n\nPoe would also help off\u00adset the costs of re\u00advers\u00ading the full COLA cuts by au\u00adthor\u00adiz\u00ading the sales of some fed\u00ader\u00adal land over\u00adseen by the Bur\u00adeau of Land Man\u00adage\u00adment and the na\u00adtion\u00adal forest sys\u00adtem.\n\nAt\u00adtack\u00ading Obama\u00adcare: Rep. Scott Des\u00adJar\u00adlais in\u00adtro\u00adduced le\u00adgis\u00adla\u00adtion that would re\u00adstore COLA fund\u00ading and make up the ad\u00added cost by re\u00addu\u00adcing the Af\u00adford\u00adable Care Act\u2019s Pre\u00adven\u00adtion and Pub\u00adlic Health Fund. The fund, part of the Af\u00adford\u00adable Care Act, in\u00advests in pro\u00adgrams aimed at im\u00adprov\u00ading health qual\u00adity and out\u00adcomes; it also sup\u00adports pre\u00adven\u00adtion pro\u00adgrams.\n\nDes\u00adJar\u00adlais isn\u2019t the first \u2014 and likely won\u2019t be the last \u2014 Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adan con\u00adgress\u00adman to tar\u00adget the fund, and the Obama ad\u00admin\u00adis\u00adtra\u00adtion has already used some of the fund to pay for oth\u00ader parts of the Af\u00adford\u00adable Care Act.\n\nSen. Ted Cruz also tried to amend the om\u00adni\u00adbus to re\u00adpeal the Af\u00adford\u00adable Care Act and re\u00adstore the full COLA fund\u00ading, des\u00adpite the fact that any sig\u00adni\u00adfic\u00adant changes to the ACA are a non\u00adstarter in the Demo\u00adcrat\u00adic\u00adally con\u00adtrolled Sen\u00adate.\n\nDrugs for Vet\u00ader\u00adans: Rep. James Lank\u00adford has in\u00adtro\u00adduced le\u00adgis\u00adla\u00adtion to re\u00adpeal the COLA cuts and swap out the fund\u00ading by re\u00adquir\u00ading the de\u00adpart\u00adments of De\u00adfense and Vet\u00ader\u00adans Af\u00adfairs to pur\u00adchase con\u00adtracts for pre\u00adscrip\u00adtion drugs to\u00adgeth\u00ader. The Ok\u00adlahoma Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adan points to $660 mil\u00adlion saved by the VA in 2005 un\u00adder a sim\u00adil\u00adar joint-pur\u00adchas\u00ading policy.\n\nChanges to the Postal Sys\u00adtem: Rep. Dar\u00adrell Issa is pro\u00adpos\u00ading to re\u00adstore COLA funds by im\u00adple\u00adment\u00ading a mod\u00adi\u00adfied Sat\u00adurday de\u00adliv\u00adery sched\u00adule. The Postal Ser\u00advice pre\u00advi\u00adously tried to change its Sat\u00adurday de\u00adliv\u00adery sched\u00adule, but mem\u00adbers of Con\u00adgress blocked the at\u00adtempt.\n\nFrom Oth\u00ader De\u00adfense De\u00adpart\u00adment Spend\u00ading: Rep. Gus Bi\u00adlira\u00adkis would off\u00adset the ap\u00adprox\u00adim\u00adately $6 bil\u00adlion in cuts by re\u00addu\u00adcing the De\u00adfense De\u00adpart\u00adment\u2019s un\u00adoblig\u00adated funds. The de\u00adpart\u00adment fin\u00adished the 2013 fisc\u00adal year with $65.4 bil\u00adlion in un\u00adoblig\u00adated money, after us\u00ading the fund to help stave off the ef\u00adfects of se\u00adquest\u00adra\u00adtion.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "National Journal", "description": "Lawmakers are scrambling to avoid veterans\u2019 anger over spending cuts, but they can\u2019t decide how to pay for it.", "title": "What Will Congress Cut to \u2018Support Our Troops\u2019?", "url": "https://www.nationaljournal.com/defense/2014/01/20/what-will-congress-cut-support-our-troops", "image": "https://www.nationaljournal.com/media/media/2013/10/18/Workbook1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "mxRH-jX1pR5MjoxIjXJOxnDElPR-loQvW49hc6LMh6w", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://www.nationaljournal.com/media/media/2013/10/18/Workbook1.jpg"}, "description": "Lawmakers are scrambling to avoid veterans\u2019 anger over spending cuts, but they can\u2019t decide how to pay for it.", "site": "@nationaljournal", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "What Will Congress Cut to \u2018Support Our Troops\u2019?"}, "description": "Lawmakers are scrambling to avoid veterans\u2019 anger over spending cuts, but they can\u2019t decide how to pay for it.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe24bf\"", "article_summary": "Kay Hagan and Mark Pry\u00ador have in\u00adtro\u00adduced le\u00adgis\u00adla\u00adtion to re\u00adpeal, while in the House, Reps.
