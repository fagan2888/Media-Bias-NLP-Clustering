At Thursday night’s Democratic town hall on MSNBC, Bernie Sanders was once again asked to define what he means by democratic socialism.

When Hispanic-Americans hear you talking about “democratic socialism,” moderator Jose Diaz-Balart noted, they can't help thinking back to Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez and other communist regimes they escaped.

“When I talk about democratic socialism, I’m talking about Social Security,” Sanders responded. “I’m talking about Medicare. In my view, we should expand that concept to all people.”

Democratic socialism, he continued, means that health care should be a right for everyone.

“I’m not looking at Cuba,” he concluded.

He’s looking at countries like Denmark, where free college is afforded to any student pursuing higher education.

Should he be elected president, he suggested he would present a government that works for middle and working class people and not just the one percent.

In case you thought Sanders was joking about offering free tuition to all students, earlier in tonight’s town hall he repeated his plan to tax Wall Street to cough up the $70 billion needed to pay for it.
