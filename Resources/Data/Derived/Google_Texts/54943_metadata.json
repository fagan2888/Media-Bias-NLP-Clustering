It has earned a reputation for good management. It if can\u2019t sell insurance through an exchange and make money, the whole program created by the ACA to get more people private health insurance must be in trouble.\n\nIn looking closer at what UnitedHealth said, however, it\u2019s too soon to conclude that the ACA exchange market is on its way to a collapse. What UnitedHealth did do was be a lot more direct than others in the industry about how it thinks this government-run market should really work.\n\nSome companies hire lobbyists. Some do that and then also announce to their shareholders that they may get out of a government-run market.\n\nThe case for getting out is, on its face, not that difficult to understand. UnitedHealth is not making money with the customers it\u2019s gotten through the exchanges.\n\nIn 2015 it\u2019s on 23 individual public exchanges, insuring about 540,000 people as of last reported count. While that\u2019s a big chunk of customers \u2014 and risk \u2014 for just about any insurer, it\u2019s not for a company the size of Minnetonka-based UnitedHealth, which has about 46 million people in all of its plans.\n\n\u201cIt might take longer for this to evolve,\u201d UnitedHealth CEO Stephen Hemsley said of insurers profiting in the ACA.\n\nAs the company explained on a conference call for shareholders late in the week before Thanksgiving, it had thought in the fall of 2014 that its initiative with ACA-related exchanges would be roughly a break-even business in 2015.\n\nInstead, it turned out to be a money loser, and the company said it will be again next year too, although the company will recognize some of next year\u2019s losses in this year\u2019s fourth quarter.\n\nSo far the company has found that people who signed up for its insurance plans through an exchange are using a lot more healthcare services than anticipated. What\u2019s worse is that healthy people have been dropping their coverage and sicker people buying in outside of the normal open enrollment period, meaning they signed up when they could after a life event like a marriage or the birth of a child.\n\nAs the 2016 open enrollment period on the exchanges got underway, UnitedHealth still had policies listed on them. But it cut its marketing as well as cut commissions paid to brokers, creating an incentive for the brokers trying to help people find insurance to go somewhere else.\n\nUnitedHealth had been one of the companies that started slowly with the exchanges, sitting out the first year entirely. As UnitedHealth CEO Stephen Hemsley told investors, \u201cperhaps we should have sat out the second year, perhaps the third. It might take longer for this to evolve.\u201d\n\nThe company is giving itself until maybe the middle of next year to decide whether it wants to stay in at all.\n\nThis news added another talking point to what\u2019s already been a contentious political debate stretching back years. But it\u2019s worth remembering a couple of things about this aspect of the ACA. One is that the individual market is about 7 percent of health insurers\u2019 revenue in 2014, since by far most Americans got insurance coverage through their jobs or through government plans such as Medicare.\n\nThe other is that the authors of the health care reform law tried to anticipate some of the difficulty insurance companies would have as a new form of the individual market got established.\n\nOne big problem, though, is that one of their good ideas, called the risk corridor program, hasn\u2019t worked out very well.\n\nIn a nutshell, the risk corridor program was meant to reimburse insurance companies that ended up insuring too many costly customers, with money collected from insurers that had a good experience with costs.\n\nIn October the federal government said insurers had $2.87 billion in risk corridor claims for 2014. Insurers with a better-than-expected experience, however, only owed $362 million in risk corridor contributions.\n\nThat meant that risk corridor payments for 2014 will cover less than 13 percent of claims.\n\nAny real fix for this problem seems to have to come from Congress. Meanwhile, that big shortfall is one reason the two-dozen or so nonprofit cooperatives created after the ACA became law already appear headed toward extinction.\n\nThe big private insurers like Aetna and UnitedHealth were in much better shape to withstand losses. Yet it can hardly be surprising that generally prices through the exchanges increased this year, along with deductibles.\n\nSome big insurers followed up UnitedHealth\u2019s announcement with calming statements of their own, saying that unlike UnitedHealth they weren\u2019t thinking about quitting the market.\n\nAnthem, an operator of Blue Cross plans, added that its executives were \u201ccontinuing our dialogue with policymakers and regulators regarding how we can improve the stability of the individual market.\u201d\n\nMaybe UnitedHealth is a regular part of that dialogue, too, but has broken ranks with the other big private insurers by deciding to communicate what it really thinks about the individual insurance marketplace through the blunt threat to pull out.\n\nWe already knew that through the ACA we decided to deliver an important benefit to people but also that it should be run through private insurance firms.\n\nWhat UnitedHealth has told us is that it\u2019s also up to us to make sure those private firms have a fair shot at making money at it.\n\nlee.schafer@startribune.com\n\n612-673-4302", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "UnitedHealth Group shook the ground under the Affordable Care Act market for individual health insurance when it said it was considering withdrawing altogether after a bad experience this year.", "title": "UnitedHealth takes a direct approach with the Affordable Care Act", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/unitedhealth-takes-a-direct-approach-with-the-affordable-care-act/354023481/", "image": {"url": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_144849114097438.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "width": 1200, "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_144849114097438.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "twitter": {"description": "UnitedHealth Group shook the ground under the Affordable Care Act market for individual health insurance when it said it was considering withdrawing altogether after a bad experience this year.", "title": "UnitedHealth takes a direct approach with the Affordable Care Act", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/unitedhealth-takes-a-direct-approach-with-the-affordable-care-act/354023481/", "image": {"src": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_144849114097438.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_144849114097438.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "description": "UnitedHealth Group shook the ground under the Affordable Care Act market for individual health insurance when it said it was considering withdrawing altogether after a bad experience this year."}, "article_summary": "The big private insurers like Aetna and UnitedHealth were in much better shape to withstand losses.\nUnitedHealth Group shook the ground under the Affordable Care Act market for individual health insurance when it said it was considering withdrawing altogether after a bad experience this year.\nWe already knew that through the ACA we decided to deliver an important benefit to people but also that it should be run through private insurance firms.\nUnitedHealth is, after all, the nation\u2019s largest health insurance company.\nSome big insurers followed up UnitedHealth\u2019s announcement with calming statements of their own, saying that unlike UnitedHealth they weren\u2019t thinking about quitting the market."}
