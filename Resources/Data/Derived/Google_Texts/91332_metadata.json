Sam Brownback\u2019s latest efforts to prevent a state budget deficit were assisted by a well-timed decision on health care funding from federal officials and better-than-expected news about teacher pensions.\n\nThe Republican governor\u2019s administration outlined $63 million in budget adjustments last week. The changes capture savings from lower-than-anticipated spending, book favorable revisions in cost estimates, shift fee dollars into the state\u2019s main bank account and tap additional federal dollars.\n\nBrownback told The Associated Press he sought to bolster the budget in ways Kansas residents wouldn\u2019t much notice. However, he\u2019s facing some skepticism from a leading advocate of children\u2019s programs and supporters of highway projects.\n\nHere is a look at the changes imposed by Brownback in the $15.4 billion budget for the fiscal year that began last month.\n\nLawmakers expected cuts\n\nThe GOP-dominated Legislature counted on Brownback trimming $50 million as part of a larger plan to keep the budget balanced through June 2016, and they were pleased by his moves last week. The plan also included sales and cigarette tax increases that took effect last month.\n\nThe state\u2019s budget problems arose after Republican legislators slashed personal income taxes at Brownback\u2019s urging in an effort to stimulate the economy. GOP lawmakers preserved past cuts in income tax rates and most of an income tax exemption granted in 2012 to 281,000 business owners and 53,000 farmers.\n\nRescued by Obamacare?\n\nThe biggest change to the budget is tying an additional $18 million in federal funds to cover healthcare for children in working-class families. The state is using the federal dollars to cut its own spending.\n\n\u201cThe timing of this was pretty fortunate in that we were notified in the last couple of days of June,\u201d Budget Director Shawn Sullivan told reporters during a Statehouse news conference.\n\nThe increase in federal funding was authorized by the 2010 federal law overhauling health care championed by President Barack Obama, though Congress provided the dollars only this year. Brownback and other Republicans are strong critics of what they call \u201cObamacare,\u201d and GOP conservatives have increased their political power in Kansas by running against the Democratic president.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s ironic,\u201d said Senate Minority Leader Anthony Hensley, a Topeka Democrat, adding that Brownback has \u201cspent the past five years blaming President Obama for everything.\u201d\n\nAdvocacy group upset\n\nThe advocacy group Kansas Action for Children was skeptical that health coverage for children won\u2019t be affected by using the extra federal dollars to reduce the state\u2019s spending.\n\nBut the group has other concerns about funding for children\u2019s programs, much of it financed with funds from states\u2019 legal settlements with tobacco companies in the 1990s. Such spending peaked at $77 million during the state\u2019s 2008 fiscal year and has declined since.\n\nBrownback and legislators have regularly shifted unspent tobacco settlement dollars into the state\u2019s main bank account to help with budget problems. The latest such move is the shifting of $2.8 million in funds previously set aside but unspent for a program aimed at improving children\u2019s reading skills.\n\n\u201cIt is clear Kansas children and families continue to foot the bill for an unsustainable tax plan,\u201d Shannon Cotsoradis, the group\u2019s president and CEO said in a statement.\n\nTeacher pension costs\n\nBrownback\u2019s budget changes capture more than $9 million in funds state agencies didn\u2019t spend during the last fiscal year, which normally would carry over into the new fiscal year.\n\nSullivan said the bulk of it \u2014 more than $7 million \u2014 is coming from the state Department of Education. He said state officials overestimated the cost of payments to the Kansas Public Employees Retirement System to cover teachers\u2019 pensions during the previous fiscal year.\n\n\u201cThat money wasn\u2019t spent,\u201d he said.\n\nTransportation savings\n\nIn tough budget times, governors and legislators have so regularly diverted funds earmarked for highway projects that they\u2019ve referred to the state Department of Transportation as \u201cthe Bank of KDOT.\u201d The current budget already diverted $132 million from highway projects.\n\nTo that, Brownback is adding $8 million in savings from operations within the agency.\n\nSullivan told reporters no highway projects would be affected. Transportation Secretary Mike King said the agency found efficiencies \u2014 and a mild winter reduced its need for salting and sanding roads.\n\nBut Economic Lifelines, a group that advocates for comprehensive state transportation programs, responded with a statement that said, \u201cEnough is enough.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe continuation of these transfers expedites the deterioration of Kansas roads,\u201d co-chairman Johnnie Koger said.\n\nCopyright 2016 The Associated Press.
