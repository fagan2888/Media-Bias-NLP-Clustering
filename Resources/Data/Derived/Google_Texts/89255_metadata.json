This week: what Obamacare's success means for the president and the GOP, what the GM recall scandal says about American industry, and Republican presidential hopefuls court the dark lord of Vegas.\n\nSix months ago, the Obamacare insurance exchanges began their official rollout with a government shutdown and a protracted website failure. Yesterday, the president announced that the Affordable Care Act's open-enrollment period had exceeded its goals, with at least 7.1 million Americans signing up. Obamacare has been the single most divisive issue in American politics since it was signed into law in March 2010. Is that period coming to an end? And has the president won?\n\nIt will not stop being a political issue until the end of the midterms, of course, because the Republicans have no other issue to run on this year \u2014 and Obamacare-bashing, like Obama-bashing in general, revs up its base. And the GOP will do well in the midterms, too \u2014 not because of the Affordable Care Act, per se, but because the Republican base (white, male, old) turns up in off-year elections and much of the Democratic base (the new America that is inexorably supplanting the GOP base) hibernates until presidential election years. After the midterms, Obamacare will be vastly diminished as a political issue except on the hard right, which, after all, still doesn\u2019t like that government \u201chealth-care takeover\u201d called Medicare either. (The new Paul Ryan budget released this week, among its other indignities, calls for replacing Medicare with a voucher system that would destroy it.) Even now the ACA isn\u2019t wildly unpopular \u2014 the country is split 49/48 in its favor according to a new Washington Post-ABC News poll \u2014 and it will gain in popularity as it takes root among those Americans who needed it and now have it. In that important sense \u2014 as policy, not politics \u2014 the president may well have won, though we won\u2019t know for sure for several years.\n\nMeanwhile, it\u2019s fascinating to see how those on the right are trying to deal with defeat by yet again trying to dispute hard statistics \u2014 claiming that the 7.1 million enrollment number is a fraud. (Actually, the real number is higher, maybe as high as 10 million in some estimates, because some who signed up for Obamacare did so directly through insurers, not through the often-troubled government exchanges.) Fox News even ran a graphic that used an outdated figure for enrollments, and visually portrayed the sign-up rate (in a bar chart) as about one-third of what it actually was. This is the same kind of magical thinking that made conservative pundits attack Nate Silver during the 2012 election and talk themselves into believing that Romney was going to win. We can only hope that Karl Rove will have another breakdown on television when he faces the reality that Obamacare has won over a significant segment of the electorate just as surely as Obama took Ohio on Election Night.\n\nGeneral Motors was one of the ringing success stories of post-crash American business, rebounding from the brink of collapse to become \u2014 with significant government assistance \u2014 a lean, profitable, and forward-looking company that capped it all off by hiring the industry's first female CEO. Now GM is in the midst of a growing scandal as evidence mounts that it ignored a dangerous, and sometimes deadly, ignition-switch defect on its cars for over a decade. What does this mean for the auto industry and American manufacturing in general? And what should Congress do about it?\n\nIt\u2019s hard to imagine how this story could be worse. GM knew it had a defect that was making its products unsafe and killing people. There was clearly an internal cover-up. And at least some of this happened while taxpayers were bailing out the company, and GM\u2019s bankruptcy status was providing it with legal protection from liability. I agree with the position that if corporations are people \u2014 as both the Supreme Court and the auto-industry scion Mitt Romney claim \u2014 then corporations should go to jail. Congress can\u2019t do much in this case except hold this week\u2019s hearings and dramatize the scale of the problem. Criminal investigations are needed along with the civil lawsuits and financial reparations already afoot. And Mary Barra has to stop this I-know-nothing routine. Her official video apology \u2014 \u201cterrible things happened\u201d \u2014 is a nausea-inducing example of egregious corporate \u201cmessaging.\u201d She sounded like an airline executive on a fasten-your-seat-belt video, though in this case it was too late for the 13 dead Cobalt drivers to fasten their seat belts because, yes, terrible things did happen at GM, even if Barra says she\u2019s clueless as to exactly what they were.\n\nThe fallout of this story extends beyond the auto industry and American manufacturing. It is consistent with what we\u2019ve learned about other sectors since the crash of 2008: GM sold Cobalts as heedlessly as financial institutions sold toxic paper on Wall Street. And it did so while the government looked the other way or actively enabled the chicanery. It might be worth noting that the number of vehicles so far recalled by GM (6.3 million this year; 758,000 in 2013) almost matches the number of Obamacare enrollments announced by the president. In the grand ideological debate about whether business or government does better by the citizenry, it\u2019s clear in this match-up that a government that sloppily and at times even haplessly brought insurance to some seven million Americans still did better by the public than a signature American corporation that sloppily brought to market some seven million cars that may have been death machines.\n\nLast week, Republican presidential hopefuls Jeb Bush, John Kasich, Scott Walker, and Chris Christie courted the conservative mega-donor and international casino magnate Sheldon Adelson in Las Vegas. Adelson's money was one of the big stories of the 2012 election, although, of course, it didn't push either his preferred candidate, Newt Gingrich, or his fallback option, Mitt Romney, over the top. Does Adelson's support really matter? And could his billions resurrect even a scandal-tarred Chris Christie?\n\nLet me ask my own question. Was this \u201cbeauty contest\u201d of potential presidents \u2014 held in the dark heart of Vegas, sponsored by the Republican Jewish Coalition, and presided over by a gambling magnate who\u2019s made much of his billions in Macau \u2014 worse for the Jews or the Republicans? That these Republican candidates think Adelson is an icon of American Jewry \u2014 and pander to his hard-line views about Israel in a sea of craps tables, slots, and prostitution \u2014 is insulting to Jews and gentiles alike. Sure, Adelson has a ton of dough to drop on whomever he decides to back in the Citizens United era, but I dare say the message of where that money comes from will not sit well with a lot of voters of all races, creeds, and religions.\n\nIt didn\u2019t help Christie that he screwed up even in this friendly setting, using the perfectly kosher term \u201coccupied territories\u201d in his love song to Israel and then cravenly apologizing to Adelson for offending his sensibilities. But each day furthers my conviction that Christie is done anyway: His use of $1 million-plus of taxpayers\u2019 money for an in-house \u201cinvestigation\u201d exonerating him in Bridgegate had the opposite of its intended effect. It looks like a cover-up and has become an instant national joke. And the financial powers that be in the GOP Establishment know this. The real story in the Republican Party right now remains as it has been: the Establishment versus the radical base. The base is coalescing around a presidential front runner, Rand Paul, who, as the Washington Post reported last week, is now organizing in all 50 states. The Establishment (and no doubt Adelson) wants a white knight to knock Paul out \u2014 but they don\u2019t have one. Giuliani, Romney, and Christie have all failed to reassert Establishment rule in the post-Bush GOP. So now (as the Post also reported) the Party\u2019s top funders are in a desperate effort to enlist the Hamlet-like Jeb Bush for the task. By 2016, Bush will have been out of public office for nearly a decade. His political views are nebulous at best, and the fact that his fluency in Spanish will win back Hispanic voters to the anti-immigrant party is a pipe dream. But even if Bush says yes, he\u2019s largely disliked by his own party\u2019s base \u2014 let alone the downer the Bush name is for the public at large. It looks like 2016 is going to be another bloody chapter in the GOP\u2019s ongoing civil war.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#000", "description": "It's the only issue Republicans have in the midterms.", "generator": "the-factory", "og": {"site_name": "Daily Intelligencer", "description": "It's the only issue Republicans have in the midterms.", "title": "Frank Rich on the National Circus: Obama Won the Obamacare War, But the GOP Won\u2019t Concede", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2014/04/frank-rich-gop-wont-surrender-in-obamacare-war.html", "image": "http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2014/04/02/02-barack-obama-obamacare.w1200.h630.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "It's the only issue Republicans have in the midterms.", "creator": "@frankrichny", "image": "http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2014/04/02/02-barack-obama-obamacare.w750.h560.2x.jpg", "title": "Frank Rich: GOP Won\u2019t Surrender in Obamacare War", "site": "@intelligencer", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Daily Intelligencer", "fb": {"app_id": 120608177953522}, "msapplication-TileImage": "//cache.nymag.com/media/di/icon.144x144.png", "application-name": "Daily Intelligencer", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "keywords": "the national circus, obamacare, sheldon adelson, gm, midterms", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/NewYorkMag", "tag": "the national circus,obamacare,sheldon adelson,gm,midterms", "published_time": "2014-04-02T16:56:00.000Z", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/pages/Frank-Rich/328892397158914"}, "topics": "topics-test, the national circus, obamacare, sheldon adelson, gm, midterms", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf132\"", "article_summary": "Every week, New York Magazine writer-at-large Frank Rich talks with contributor Eric Benson about the biggest stories in politics and culture.\nObamacare has been the single most divisive issue in American politics since it was signed into law in March 2010.\nSix months ago, the Obamacare insurance exchanges began their official rollout with a government shutdown and a protracted website failure.\nLast week, Republican presidential hopefuls Jeb Bush, John Kasich, Scott Walker, and Chris Christie courted the conservative mega-donor and international casino magnate Sheldon Adelson in Las Vegas.\nIn that important sense \u2014 as policy, not politics \u2014 the president may well have won, though we won\u2019t know for sure for several years."}
