This is Minnesota's worst start since the Washington Senators moved to the Twin Cities in 1961.\n\nChristian Colon drew a leadoff walk in the 10th from Trevor May (0-1). Gore then made his first appearance of the season, running for Colon, and dashed to third on May's throwing error on a pickoff attempt.\n\nMay retired the next two batters and issued a walk. With a 1-2 count on Lorenzo Cain, May threw a breaking ball that bounced off catcher John Ryan Murphy's chest protector and skittered to the right side of the plate.\n\nGore beat Murphy's throw to May covering the plate. May slammed down his hand in frustration after Gore scored.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "Speedy pinch runner Terrance Gore streaked home on a wild pitch with two outs in the 10th inning, scoring with a headfirst slide to lift the Kansas City Royals over the winless Minnesota Twins 4-3 Sunday.", "language": "english", "author": "Associated Press", "og": {"url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Gore-scores-on-wild-pitch-in-10th-Royals-beat-winless-Twins-375196281.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/Kansas-City-Royals-generic-Kaufman-Stadium.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Speedy pinch runner Terrance Gore streaked home on a wild pitch with two outs in the 10th inning, scoring with a headfirst slide to lift the Kansas City Royals over the winless Minnesota Twins 4-3 Sunday.", "title": "Gore scores on wild pitch in 10th, Royals beat winless Twins"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kake.com", "description": "Speedy pinch runner Terrance Gore streaked home on a wild pitch with two outs in the 10th inning, scoring with a headfirst slide to lift the Kansas City Royals over the winless Minnesota Twins 4-3 Sunday.", "title": "Gore scores on wild pitch in 10th, Royals beat winless Twins", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Gore-scores-on-wild-pitch-in-10th-Royals-beat-winless-Twins-375196281.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/Kansas-City-Royals-generic-Kaufman-Stadium.jpg", "creator": "@KAKEnews", "site": "@KAKEnews", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "keywords": "Gore scores on wild pitch in 10th, Royals beat winless Twins", "google-site-verification": "H0mev8O__gMqb34WcvOyZgBXFMRQZvDAQ0YTSGJ9hGQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Gore scores on wild pitch, in 10th"}, "article_summary": "Speedy pinch runner Terrance Gore streaked home on a wild pitch with two outs in the 10th inning, scoring with a headfirst slide to lift the Kansas City Royals over the winless Minnesota Twins 4-3 Sunday.\nThe World Series champion Royals rallied for two runs in the ninth to tie it, then dropped the Twins to 0-6.\nGore beat Murphy's throw to May covering the plate.\nChristian Colon drew a leadoff walk in the 10th from Trevor May (0-1).\nGore then made his first appearance of the season, running for Colon, and dashed to third on May's throwing error on a pickoff attempt."}
