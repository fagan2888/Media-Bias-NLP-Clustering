Kohl\u2019s, Walmart, JCPenny, Gap, and Macy\u2019s are all in the losing category, with closings already totaling a 33.2 percent rise above store closings in 2015.\n\nBut even 2015 was a 29 percent increase from the numbers in 2014, and 2014 was up from 2013.\n\n\u201cWe are hitting a tipping point,\u201d Richard Church, managing director of Discern Investment Analytics, told the Post. \u201cWe are in a weak demand environment that could meaningfully accelerate next year.\u201d\n\nBy some analysis in 2014, the retail sector suffered a \u201ctsunami\u201d of store closings as retailers such as Sears, JCPenney, Radio Shack, office supply chain Staples, and Macy\u2019s were hit by a wave of store closings. Other retailers, like Sam\u2019s and Target, laid off thousands of people as they closed their stores.\n\nLast year, the contraction continued with chains such as Dunkin\u2019 Donuts closing stores. Macy\u2019s also continued to lose outlets after closing its landmark store in Pittsburgh.\n\nSo far this year, Walmart has announced the closing of 269 stores, sportswear chain Sports Authority closed 140 stores, and once again, Macy\u2019s is closing outlets.\n\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail.com.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The retail sector continues to contract as the economy struggles with anemic growth in the era of President Obama,\u00a0resulting in increased store\u00a0closures.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "The retail sector continues to contract as the economy struggles with anemic growth in the era of President Obama,\u00a0resulting in increased store\u00a0closures.", "title": "Store Closures Surpassing Last Year - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/01/store-closing-AP.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/03/21/store-closures-surpassing-last-year/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The retail sector continues to contract as the economy struggles with anemic growth in the era of President Obama,\u00a0resulting in increased store\u00a0closures.", "title": "Store Closures Surpassing Last Year - Breitbart", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/01/store-closing-AP.jpg", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "economy, Retail, store closures, Stores,Big Government, Economics,Store Closures", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "Stores", "published_time": "2016-03-21T06:02:07-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,Economics"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThe retail sector is continuing to contract as the U.S. economy continues to struggle with anemic growth in the era of President Barack Obama, resulting in increased store closures.\nKohl\u2019s, Walmart, JCPenny, Gap, and Macy\u2019s are all in the losing category, with closings already totaling a 33.2 percent rise above store closings in 2015.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThe paper lists nearly half-a-dozen firms that are closing stores.\nAs Men\u2019s Wearhouse announced it is shutting down 250 stores, the New York Post pointed out this year\u2019s store closings are already outpacing that of this time last year.\nLast year, the contraction continued with chains such as Dunkin\u2019 Donuts closing stores."}
