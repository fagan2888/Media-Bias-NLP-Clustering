We\u2019re going to impose a tax that if they sell insurance that\u2019s too expensive, we\u2019re going to tax them,\u2019\u201d Gruber said. \u201cAnd, conveniently, the tax rate will happen to be the marginal tax rate under the income tax code.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, basically, it\u2019s the same thing: We just tax the insurance companies, they pass on higher prices that offsets the tax break we get, it ends up being the same thing,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s a very clever, you know, basically exploitation of the lack of economic understanding of the American voter.\u201d\n\nElsewhere in the address, Gruber suggested that American voters are callous by nature and would have been much more strongly opposed to Obamacare if the reduction of healthcare costs had not been framed as its chief aim.\n\n\u201cThe dirty secret is the American voter doesn\u2019t actually care about the uninsured,\" Gruber said. \"The dirty secret is: You can\u2019t really get a law passed by saying, \u2018We\u2019re helping the uninsured.\u2019 You have to make it about cost control to get it passed. Because that\u2019s what the American public cares about. So they had to make this law not just about the uninsured, but about cost control. That was a challenge,\u201d he added.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A chief architect of the Affordable Care Act said in 2012 in a talk at the University of Rhode Island that the then-Democratic Congress exploited American voters' \u201clack of economic understanding\u201d when it passed the massive 2010 healthcare law.\nJonathan Gruber\u2019s comment is the latest in a string of old but controversial remarks that have recently gained public attention.\n\u201cIn America, we have a pernicious feature of our tax code, which says that if MIT pays me in wages, I get taxed,\u201d Gruber, an MIT health economist, said during his address. \u201cBut if your employer pays you in health insurance, you do not.\u201d\nGruber explained that most Americans become defensive and object when policymakers try to change this, because they don't want their health insurance to be taxed.
