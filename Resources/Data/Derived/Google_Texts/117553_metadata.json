Employing new research techniques previous studies have failed to examine, a team of researchers from the University of Houston and the University of Illinois have found that birth order has such a small effect on personality and IQ, it is almost insignificant. Their findings have been published in the Journal of Research in Personality.\n\nProblems with previous studies\n\nIn order to conduct this study, researchers looked at the personality and intelligence of 377,000 high school students, the largest pool to be studied for the outcomes of birth order. According to Rodica Damian, postdoctoral researcher and professor of psychology at Houston University, this larger sample size, along with the new research model used to compare personality and IQ created for a more accurate analysis of the effects of birth order. Damian states that previous studies on the topic suffered from gathering information from too small of a pool, while also employing the \u201cwithin-family\u201d design to study participants. This model often suggests that comparing children with their siblings, rather than comparing children from different families was the best point of analysis. When examining children from other families with one another, researchers can find any consistencies between a range of first-borns and a range of later-borns.\n\n\u201c[Within-family] studies often don\u2019t measure the personality of each child individually,\u201d Damian said in a recent press release. \u201cThey just ask one child \u2014 usually the oldest, \u2018Are you more conscientious than your siblings?\u2019\u201d\n\nFor an ideal \u201cwithin-family\u201d study, says the team, researchers would have to examine a family over a long period of time, gathering data about personality and IQ from each child when they reached a specific age. This didn\u2019t seem to be happening.\n\nWhat the new study found\n\nWhen conducting research outside of the \u201cwithin-family\u201d model, Damian, along with Brent Roberts, a psychology professor at the University of Illinois found that first-borns do have higher IQs than later-born children, but this IQ difference is only one point higher. In essence, the difference is pretty insignificant.\n\nResearchers found a similar, minute difference in the case of personalities among siblings. For example, first-borns did tend to be more extroverted, agreeable, conscientious, and have less anxiety than their younger siblings, but the difference was \u201cinfinitesimally small,\u201d amounting to a 0.02 correlation.\n\n\u201cIn some cases, if a drug saves 10 out of 10,000 lives, for example, small effects can be profound,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cBut in terms of personality traits and how you rate them, a 0.02 correlation doesn\u2019t get you anything of note. You are not going to be able to see it with the naked eye. You\u2019re not going to be able to sit two people down next to each other and see the differences between them. It\u2019s not noticeable by anybody.\u201d\n\nDamian says that when conducting their study, the team made sure to control for factors that could taint data, taking into account a family\u2019s economic status, the number of children and the relative age of siblings when the study was taking place. Researchers also examined a subset of participants for their study consisting of children who lived with families of two siblings, and two parents. The team was then able to look more in-depth at personality and IQ changes between first- and second-borns, or second- and third-borns. Overall, these findings reflected those of the larger study; there was a difference between the first- and second-born, as well as the second- and third-born, but it was \u201cminiscule,\u201d according to Roberts.\n\nThe take-away from all of this? \u201cBirth order probably should not influence your parenting, because it\u2019s not meaningfully related to your kid\u2019s personality or IQ,\u201d Damian said.\n\nSo yes, you and your younger/older sibling may seem like complete opposites, but you may have more in common than you care to admit.\n\nSource: Damian R, Roberts B.
