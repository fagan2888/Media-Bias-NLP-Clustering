Minnesota is the only state that has set up the basic health program, although New York is taking steps in that direction. If states opt in, the federal government would cover 95 percent of the subsidies that enrollees would have otherwise collected in the marketplaces, although it's not allowed to cover administrative costs.

Aides said they only recently discovered how the administration was funding Minnesota's program, through looking at the state's first-quarter payment this year.

Prodded by Roskam at a hearing Wednesday, Burwell acknowledged the basic health program payments are coming out of the IRS fund but said "tax credits for programs" aren't part of the discretionary funding that must be approved by Congress.

"What extra-constitutional authority are you invoking that allows you to spend money that has not been appropriated?" Roskam asked her.
