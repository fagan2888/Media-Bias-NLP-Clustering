REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque\n\n4257304\n\nObamacare customers in Tennessee and Louisiana are now a part of the growing list of Americans who are facing double-digit premium hikes in the wake of the health care law.\n\nBlue Cross and Blue Shield of Tennessee, the largest health insurer in the state, is upping its exchange premiums by an average of 19 percent, according to rate request filings. Humana is requesting an average 14.4 percent increase and Cigna is asking for a 7.5 percent rate increase, The Tennessean reports. (RELATED: Ohio Obamacare Premiums Up By Double Digits For 2015)\n\nLouisiana customers will face even larger hikes. Blue Cross Blue Shield of Louisiana, the largest insurer in Louisiana as well, has proposed rate hikes between 18.3 percent and 19.7 percent for Obamacare customers. The company covers 52,600 people \u2014 over half of all those who signed up for Obamacare exchange coverage in Louisiana.\n\nHumana in Louisiana hopes to hike its rates by 15.7 percent and Time Insurance Company, which covers just 1,000 customers, is requesting a 24 percent rate hike, according to state filings.\n\nInsurance departments in both states will have to approve the premium hikes before they\u2019re finalized, but it\u2019s unlikely the final increases will be much lower.

But Obamacare supporters have largely abandoned the pledge to lower premium costs outright.

The timing of the expected rate hikes is making White House officials increasingly nervous about Democratic prospects in the November midterm elections, Politico reports.\n\nWhile premiums are already increasing, certain provisions in the health care law are preventing customers from feeling the full brunt of Obamacare. The law\u2019s risk corridor provisions redistribute funds amongst insurers participating in the exchanges, attempting to prevent companies from hiking rates due to enrolling high numbers of sick and costly individuals.\n\nBut several of the risk corridor provisions will be terminated in 2016 \u2014 and experts expect that health insurance premiums will skyrocket the next year.
