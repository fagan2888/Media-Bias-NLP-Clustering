PC: Not at this time, no. Liberals: We will link future increases to the Consumer Price Index to provide small business with the predictability they need to plan for their future. NDP: Yes, we plan to phase in a $12/hr. minimum wage over two years combined with a similarly phased in reduction in the small business tax from 4.5% to 3%. Green: The GPO would gradually raise the minimum wage to $12 an hour and index it to inflation. Do you support or oppose the implementation of the proposed Ontario Retirement Pension Plan? PC: We strongly oppose it. I agree with small businesses that affordable and portable Pooled Registered Pension Plans are a great opportunity. Liberals: We support the ORPP to help ensure that Ontarians have the secure retirement that they need and deserve. NDP: If it becomes clear that there will be no federal support for a CPP enhancement, an Ontario NDP government will implement an Ontario Pension Plan. Green: The Green Party supports pension reforms to ensure that all Ontarians have adequate financial resources to retire with dignity. We believe such reforms are best made at the federal level.\n\nThe Canadian Federation of Independent Business recently asked each of the four candidates how they would deal with issues that affect Ontario\u2019s small businesses, including tackling red tape, addressing high energy prices and their stance on taxes.\n\nOntario has some 372,000 employer businesses, with small firms (those with fewer than 100 employees) making up about 98% of those businesses. Issues such as bureaucratic burden and Ontario\u2019s high energy prices have been a particular challenge for entrepreneurs in the province \u2014 topics that are rarely discussed in the context of small businesses.\n\n\u201cWe surveyed our members recently and they felt small business issues have not been discussed thoroughly in this campaign,\u201d said Plamen Petkov, vice-president of CFIB Ontario. \u201cSo this is a chance to get the candidates on record about where they stand on topics that affect small business owners in Ontario.\u201d\n\nBelow, each of the candidates present their answers on how they would help small businesses in the province:\n\nPCs Mr. Hudak, whose platform focuses on his Million Jobs Plan, said his government would help small businesses in the province by cutting taxes and implementing spending cut recommendations made by Don Drummond, former chief economist at TD Bank.\n\n\u201cWe will lower [taxes], first by replacing corporate welfare with fair and lower taxes for all job creators, and then by reducing income taxes after the budget is balanced,\u201d Mr. Hudak said. \u201cWe will abolish the College of Trades and its new trades tax, end eco taxes, repeal WSIB Bill 119, and we will not proceed with massive new payroll taxes for a new government pension scheme.\u201d WSIB Bill 119 made it mandatory for most construction workers to have coverage starting Jan. 1, 2013.\n\nMr. Hudak added that he expects to have the provincial budget balanced by 2016, following the guidelines made in the Drummond Report. Those recommendations include freezing wages for every government worker, shrinking cabinet, lowering spending in every area of government but health care, reducing the size of the government payroll by 100,000 positions to 2009 levels, bringing balance back to benefits for government workers, alternative service delivery and comprehensive arbitration reform.\n\nLiberals Ms. Wynne said her government would help reduce red tape by renewing the Open for Business initiative and introducing the \u201cBetter Business Climate Act,\u201d which would require government to report annually on regulatory burden reduction.\n\nIn addition, she said, the Liberals would launch the Five-Point Business Energy Savings Plan, which would provide small businesses with \u201cthe tools they need to understand their bills, conserve energy, manage costs and save money.\u201d\n\nMs Wynne said the Liberals plan to balance the budget by 2017-18 and would not increase taxes on small business, maintaining the corporate income tax rate for small businesses at 4.5%.\n\nShe added that the Liberals would raise the Employer Health Tax Exemption from $400,000 to $450,000 of annual Ontario payroll Harmonized Sales Tax, saying it would \u201csave businesses $4.6-billion a year through input tax credits.\u201d\n\nHer party would also eliminate the Capital Tax, which she expects will save businesses more than $2.1-billion a year. Finally, Ms. Wynne said she would bring in enhanced tax credit rates to small businesses for employee training and would extend the Accelerated Capital Cost Allowance to 2015, cutting taxes by $265-million by 2016.\n\nRelated\n\nNDP Ms. Horwath said her platform sees small businesses as being a core part of creating new jobs in Ontario.\n\n\u201cWe are putting forward an ambitious program that includes a two-year phase-in of a 1.5% reduction in the small business rate from 4.5% to 3%,\u201d Ms. Horwath said. \u201cThe Ontario NDP is also proposing a Job Creator Tax Credit that will provide a $5,000 tax credit for each new job created by an eligible business.\u201d\n\nMs. Horwath also said that the NDP would help lower energy costs in Ontario by merging four of Ontario\u2019s hydro agencies and capping their CEOs\u2019 salaries.\n\n\u201cWe will also get a better price for electricity exports through direct trading and take the HST off home heating bills,\u201d Ms. Horwath said. \u201cWe need a government that can stand up for families and deliver on lower energy costs.\u201d\n\nMs. Horwath added that the Ontario NDP will balance the budget by 2017-18 by \u201csaving $600-million with a Minister of Savings and Accountability, stopping corporate tax giveaways and closing loopholes, toughening up rules on government partisan advertising and appointing a financial accountability officer to stop waste before it happens.\u201d\n\nGreen Party Mr. Schreiner, co-founder of WOW Foods, an award winning local organic food distribution company and Earthdance Organics, a Guelph-based food production business that supplied area health foods stores and farmer\u2019s markets in the early 2000s, understands the challenges small businesses face.\n\n\u201cThe Green Party of Ontario recognizes the essential contributions to our economy and job-creating ability of small businesses,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m a small business owner who doesn\u2019t think the political status quo is working.\u201d\n\nMr. Schreiner said the Green Party will lower payroll taxes by doubling the Employer Health Tax exemption from $450,000 to $900,000 for small business with payrolls of less than $5-million.\n\n\u201cThis will put up to $18,000 per year in your register to help grow your business,\u201d he said.\n\nMoney for the new exemptions will come from raising Ontario\u2019s corporate income tax rate to 12.5%, reversing the 1% cut made by the Liberals, said Mr. Schreiner. He also said he would work with small businesses to reform the Workplace Safety and Insurance Board.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Issues such as bureaucratic burden and Ontario's high energy prices have been a particular challenge for entrepreneurs in the province \u2014 topics that are rarely discussed in the context of small businesses", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "Financial Post", "description": "Issues such as bureaucratic burden and Ontario's high energy prices have been a particular challenge for entrepreneurs in the province \u2014 topics that are rarely discussed in the context of small...", "title": "Here's what Ontario's premier candidates are promising for small businesses", "url": "http://business.financialpost.com/entrepreneur/heres-what-ontarios-premier-candidates-are-promising-for-small-businesses", "image": "http://www.financialpost.com/images/blavatar_fp_300.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "http://business.financialpost.com", "description": "Issues such as bureaucratic burden and Ontario's high energy prices have been a particular challenge for entrepreneurs in the province \u2014 topics that are rarely discussed in the context of small...", "title": "Here's what Ontario's premier candidates are promising for small businesses", "image": {"src": "http://www.financialpost.com/images/blavatar_fp_300.png"}, "site": "@financialpost", "card": "summary"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Just another WordPress.com site", "fb": {"admins": 576295511, "app_id": 138801856165024}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "Financial Post", "keywords": "c-suite, andrea horwath, kathleen wynne, mike schreiner, ontario election 2014, ontario politics, tim hudak", "google-site-verification": "UhYuz5WLj9O99xHz05IP4O2gExeR_rozYMFxe-OeqTg", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://business.financialpost.com/feed;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/b4ece3189893389a03f063830eacd95c?s=16"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc612\"", "article_summary": "minimum wage over two years combined with a similarly phased in reduction in the small business tax from 4.5% to 3%.\nHe also said he would work with small businesses to reform the Workplace Safety and Insurance Board.\nRelatedNDP Ms. Horwath said her platform sees small businesses as being a core part of creating new jobs in Ontario.\nI agree with small businesses that affordable and portable Pooled Registered Pension Plans are a great opportunity.\n\u201cThe Green Party of Ontario recognizes the essential contributions to our economy and job-creating ability of small businesses,\u201d he said."}
