Davenport was a racer who had a vague idea he wanted to make a career out of skiing, and Dawson\u2019s book became a signpost.\n\nDawson was the first to ski all of Colorado\u2019s 14,000-foot peaks, an odyssey that took him 13 years.\n\n\u201cI loved that book,\u201d Davenport said. \u201cNot only was it a guide to the fourteeners, it included skiing for all the peaks. It was something I\u2019d never seen before, a guide to ski mountaineering. That book became my bible.\u201d\n\nIn 2007, Davenport made his own contribution to Colorado ski history, becoming the first to ski all of the fourteeners in a year. For that and many other achievements the Aspen resident was inducted into the U.S. Ski and Snowboard Hall of Fame on Saturday in Steamboat Springs.\n\n\u201cI feel like I have so much more to do skiing and so much more to give,\u201d said Davenport, 44. \u201cI\u2019m young. I want to be Klaus Obermeyer, I want to be 95 and skiing Buttermilk every day.\u201d\n\nDavenport has summited Mount Everest and skied the adjacent Lhotse face. He has skied Mont Blanc and the Matterhorn. He is a two-time world extreme skiing champion, a Winter X Games medalist. But he also tunes race skis for kids in the Aspen Valley Ski Club.\n\nThere is a T.S. Eliot quote he loves and lives: \u201cOnly those who will risk going too far can possibly find out how far one can go.\u201d\n\nDavenport grew in up New Hampshire\u2019s Mount Washington valley, a revered place in New England skiing. He began skiing Tuckerman\u2019s Ravine before he was a teenager. There the heart of the ski mountaineer was born.\n\n\u201cYou put in all this hard work to climb the mountain,\u201d Davenport said. \u201cI love the workout, I love the pace and the movement, climbing on snow and ice. The skiing is the reward, the payoff: being on the summit, clicking into your bindings, high-fiving your friends and getting a ski descent that can take 10 minutes when people walking down are taking two hours or more.\u201d\n\nBut there is danger, too, when the goal is to test limits.\n\n\u201cThe thing I\u2019m maybe most proud of is that I\u2019m still here, still alive,\u201d said the father of three ranging in age from 13 to 7. \u201cI\u2019ve lost so many friends in the mountains. As much as I think I am educated and know what I\u2019m doing, the mountains don\u2019t care. We lose people that really know what they\u2019re doing, often. I\u2019m very proud that I\u2019ve done all these things and I\u2019m still around. I\u2019m even more proud that I\u2019ve been able to raise a family while continuing to do what I do.\u201d\n\nIt was the late Shane McConkey \u2014 who died base-jumping on skis in the Italian Dolomites in 2009 \u2014 who steered Davenport\u2019s career. Davenport had moved to Aspen in 1993 and was working in the race department at Snowmass. McCon key called him, suggesting he join him at the U.S. Extreme Championships in Crested Butte.\n\nDavenport had never heard of it but accepted the invitation.\n\n\u201cIt blew my mind,\u201d Davenport said. \u201cI remember driving home thinking: \u2018When\u2019s the next event? When can I do more of this?\u2019 Shane\u2019s phone call started all that.\u201d McConkey was inducted into the U.S. Ski Hall of Fame posthumously in 2010.\n\nDavenport\u2019s career turning point came when he won the 1996 world extreme championships in Alaska. It meant he could quit his job in Aspen and live the life of a sponsored professional skier.\n\nHis hardest victory was the 24 Hours of Aspen in 1998, when he skied 240,000 feet on 80 runs. His most emotional moment was standing at the foot of Longs Peak after skiing his 54th fourteener in 363 days.\n\n\u201cIt was such a personal journey, and there were a lot of times I wanted to quit,\u201d Davenport said. \u201cThere were some tears. I had no idea if I could do it.\u201d\n\nFor a single moment in time, Davenport most savors the summit of Everest in 2011.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re standing on the highest point in the world,\u201d Davenport said. \u201cI shot a video of myself, and I\u2019m getting choked up because it\u2019s just so darned beautiful. \u2026 The story of great experiences on Mount Everest never really gets told. All you hear about is the tragedy and the garbage. That\u2019s not what we experienced. As a lover of mountains, collector of summits and ski descents, that one ranks right up there.\u201d\n\nThere are so many more mountains to ski \u2014 up and down.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m always soul searching,\u201d Davenport said. \u201cI never want to be one of those people going through the motions of life, stuck in a box or a routine. I want to experiment in the mountains and see what\u2019s possible.\u201d\n\nJohn Meyer: jmeyer@denverpost.com or twitter.com/johnmeyer", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Chris Davenport\u2019s skiing adventures lead him into Hall of Fame", "title": "Chris Davenport\u2019s skiing adventures lead him into Hall of Fame", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/04/11/chris-davenports-skiing-adventures-lead-him-into-hall-of-fame/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150411_074700_chris-davenport.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150411_074700_chris-davenport.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-11T19:38:12+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-24T23:12:23+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf281\"", "article_summary": "\u201cYou\u2019re standing on the highest point in the world,\u201d Davenport said.\n\u201cI feel like I have so much more to do skiing and so much more to give,\u201d said Davenport, 44.\nHe is a two-time world extreme skiing champion, a Winter X Games medalist.\nHis most emotional moment was standing at the foot of Longs Peak after skiing his 54th fourteener in 363 days.\nDavenport was a racer who had a vague idea he wanted to make a career out of skiing, and Dawson\u2019s book became a signpost."}
