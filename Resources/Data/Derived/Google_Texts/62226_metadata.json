Now some cancer patients are doing the same \u2014 with the hope of curing their own disease.\n\nThey are paying a private lab to breed mice that carry bits of their own tumors so treatments can be tried first on the customized rodents. The idea is to see which drugs might work best on a specific person\u2019s specific cancer.\n\nThe mice may help patients make what can be very hard choices under difficult circumstances. Studies can suggest a certain chemotherapy may help, but patients wonder whether it will work for them. Often there\u2019s more than one choice, and if the first one fails, a patient may be too sick to try another. So hundreds of people have made \u201cmouse avatars\u201d over the last few years to test chemotherapies.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m doing is personalized cancer treatment. It\u2019s the wave of the future,\u201d said Eileen Youtie, a Miami woman using mice to guide care for her hard-to-treat form of breast cancer. \u201cPart of this is trying to eliminate chemos that are not going to work on me. I don\u2019t want to waste time taking them and poison my body.\u201d\n\nBut there are no guarantees the mice will help.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not a lot of science\u201d to say how well this works, and it should be considered highly experimental, said Dr. Len Lichtenfeld, deputy chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society.\n\nThere are some early encouraging reports, he said. One study of 70 patients found the mice generally reflected how well patients responded to various drugs. But there is no evidence that using mice is any better than care based on medical guidelines or the gene tests that many patients get now to help pick drugs.\n\nMouse testing costs $10,000 or more, and insurers don\u2019t cover it. It takes several months, so patients usually have to start therapy before mouse results are in.\n\n\u201cI do see promise, but it\u2019s very time-consuming, it\u2019s very expensive. For the average patient, standard care is going to be the way to go,\u201d said Alana Welm, a cancer researcher at the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation. She gave a talk on mouse avatars last week at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium. It was the third major cancer meeting this year to feature work on customized cancer mice.\n\nSeveral labs breed these mice but the main supplier to patients has been Champions Oncology, a company based in Hackensack, New Jersey, that also operates in London, Tel Aviv and Singapore. About 7,000 mice are kept in a Baltimore lab with six rooms that resemble stock rooms of a shoe store, with tall shelves that hold row upon row of plastic cages labeled with each cancer patient\u2019s name.\n\nMost mice are white-haired females with beady red eyes, but others are hairless. Some live alone while others climb over one another and sleep in small piles. All have easy access to food and water, and many bear signs of the tumor graft \u2014 a shaved portion of hair, an incision scar and a lump growing off one side.\n\nPatients have a tumor sample sent to Champions, which charges $1,500 to bank it, plus $2,500 for each drug tested in groups of mice implanted with bits of the tumor. Most patients try three to five drugs and spend $10,000 to $12,000, said Champions\u2019 chief medical officer, Dr. Angela Davies.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Cancer patients testing drugs on mouse \u2018avatars\u2019", "title": "Cancer patients testing drugs on mouse \u2018avatars\u2019", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Cancer patients testing drugs on mouse \u2018avatars\u2019", "title": "Cancer patients testing drugs on mouse \u2018avatars\u2019", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/12/14/cancer_patients_testing_drugs_on_mouse_avatars/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/12/personal-cancer-mice.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Cancer patients testing drugs on mouse \u2018avatars\u2019", "title": "Cancer patients testing drugs on mouse \u2018avatars\u2019", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/12/personal-cancer-mice.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Marilynn Marchione", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce769\"", "article_summary": "Now some cancer patients are doing the same \u2014 with the hope of curing their own disease.\nIt was the third major cancer meeting this year to feature work on customized cancer mice.\nThe mice may help patients make what can be very hard choices under difficult circumstances.\nOne study of 70 patients found the mice generally reflected how well patients responded to various drugs.\nMost patients try three to five drugs and spend $10,000 to $12,000, said Champions\u2019 chief medical officer, Dr. Angela Davies."}
