PORTLAND, Ore. (OCP) August 18, 2015 – The 2015 OCP Parish Grant Program will award 98 parishes spanning 89 dioceses in the United States grants amounting to a total of $200,000.

“Service to the Church is one of the guiding principles of our company,” said John Limb, OCP’s publisher. “OCP is honored to provide financial support through its Parish Grant Program to U.S. Catholic churches working to engage and unite followers of Christ through excellent liturgy and music.”

The Parish Grant Program serves the Catholic Church by providing financial support to parishes in need. Now in its 15th year, the program has provided over $2.2 million in direct financial assistance to enhance the worship experience of Roman Catholic parishes in the United States. To date, more than 1,000 parishes across the United States have received assistance from the program.

“Oregon Catholic Press continues to make a significant contribution in many ways to the dignity and reverence of Catholic worship in the United States,” said Bishop Jaime Soto of the Diocese of Sacramento.

Applications for the 2016 grant program may be submitted online in early 2016. Recipients of the 2015 program are asked to wait one year prior to applying for another grant. For more information, please visit ocp.org/grants. All U.S. Catholic parishes are eligible to apply, even if they don’t currently use an OCP worship program.
