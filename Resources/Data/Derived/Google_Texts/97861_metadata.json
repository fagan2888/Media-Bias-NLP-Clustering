During this same period, 53 percent of ER visits were for non-emergencies.\n\n\u201cThe local emergency medical services system has reached a critical tipping point,\u201d said Dimitrios Alexiou, president and CEO of the Hospital Association of San Diego and Imperial Counties. \u201cThis is not the result of any single factor, and it did not occur overnight. It has been building for several years, and has increased notably since the start of the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\nThat perspective was echoed by San Diego County Fire Chiefs\u2019 Association President Don Butz, who is chief of the Viejas Fire Department and represented ambulance providers.\n\n\u201cEmergency room overcrowding has effects outside the hospital,\u201d Butz said. \u201cIt can result in ambulances being backed up and unavailable for longer periods before they are able to respond to future calls.\u201d\n\nOfficials stressed that if individuals feel they have a medical emergency, then to call 9-1-1 or go to their emergency department.\n\n\u201cTrust your instinct and if you feel a problem is serious, don\u2019t hesitate to go to the nearest emergency room,\u201d said Dr. Nora Faine, medical director of Molina Healthcare of California. \u201cOn the other hand, if a situation is a non-emergency, then contact your medical provider for assistance.\u201d\n\nFor those who do not have medical insurance, 2-1-1 San Diego can connect individuals to resources like local community clinics and health centers, and can assist with Medi-Cal and Covered California applications for health care coverage.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Seaside Courier", "description": "The number of visits to emergency rooms in the San Diego area hit a record 1 million last year, according to\u00a0Dr. Wilma Wooten, county public health officer.", "title": "Public asked to use ERs only in true emergencies", "url": "http://www.seasidecourier.com/news/public-asked-to-use-ers-only-in-true-emergencies/article_3a6d7b74-f2ca-11e5-8912-ff7648331f9f.html", "image": {"width": 480, "identifier": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/seasidecourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/3/e2/3e2cd80e-f2ca-11e5-b301-cb14a2fd4a98/56f5a30176499.preview.jpg?resize=480%2C360", "height": 360}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@SeasideCourier", "card": "summary"}, "description": "The number of visits to emergency rooms in the San Diego area hit a record 1 million last year, according to\u00a0Dr. Wilma Wooten, county public health officer.", "alexaVerifyID": "nGwqFv2r6mI3b4HT0da6w7Wzb-k", "fb": {"app_id": 1489460678010360}, "keywords": "san diego county,emergency room visits,dr. wilma wooten,er,news,san_diego_region,health_and_fitness", "news_keywords": "san diego county,emergency room visits,dr. wilma wooten,er,news,san_diego_region,health_and_fitness"}, "article_summary": "\u201cEmergency room overuse is a national problem that is also occurring in San Diego County,\u201d Wooten said.\nThe number of visits to emergency rooms in the San Diego area hit a record 1 million last year, according to Dr. Wilma Wooten, county public health officer.\nIn the past decade, the number of emergency room visits has increased by 40 percent, while San Diego County\u2019s population grew by 7 percent.\n\u201cEmergency room overcrowding has effects outside the hospital,\u201d Butz said.\nIn an effort to reduce congestion at local hospital emergency rooms, Wooten and other regional health care leaders urged the public on Friday to use emergency rooms only in actual medical emergencies and provided recommendations for individuals on managing their health care to avoid ER overuse."}
