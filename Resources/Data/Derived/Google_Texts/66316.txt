It’s no secret the Cleveland Browns have bad luck with coaches. They’ve gone through three in the past five seasons, most recently firing Rob Chudzinski.

So in an effort to encourage their favorite team to pick someone best suited to take his place, 10-year-olds Caroline Comisford, Caitlyn Daube and Lulu Yearling filmed a video plea with the franchise to get them to hire former Ohio State coach Jim Tressel.

Right away, the adorable Comisford compares the Cleveland Browns to Obamacare: “We suck bad. Like Obamacare bad.”

WATCH:

Lulu’s father Mike Yearling, of Yearling Pictures, got the idea to use his daughter and her friends as a way to draw attention to the possibility, reports the Newark Advocate. ”

“My endgame is that enough people love this idea that the Browns organization starts to think more clearly,” he said. “At least evaluate Tressel for the person he is and not for the fact that he’s never been an NFL coach, because I truly believe he can transform organizations, and that’s one that needs to be transformed.”
