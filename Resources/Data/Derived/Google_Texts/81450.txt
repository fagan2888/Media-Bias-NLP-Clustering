On Wednesday, 25-year-old Raymond Harjo turned himself in to police.

Police say an argument began inside a home Ronald Boley shared with his mother, Gwen, in Shawnee.

A Shawnee man turned himself in to police Wednesday, just hours after another man he allegedly stabbed five days ago died.

Raymond Harjo, 25, is accused of stabbing 32-year-old Ronald Boley in the neck during a fight last Friday night.

Police say an argument began inside a home Boley shared with his mother in Shawnee.

Police say a family member of Harjo's began arguing and fighting with Boley outside the house, and Harjo stepped in and stabbed Boley.

Boley died at OU Medical Center Wednesday morning.

His mother, Gwen, was in despair Wednesday afternoon.

“I just hope you're caught! I hope they give you the death penalty," said Gwen. "Forgive me for saying that, but you deserve it. You took my son for no reason.”

Police say Harjo will be charged with first-degree murder.
