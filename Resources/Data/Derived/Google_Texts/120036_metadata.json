The No. 2 back comes in and busts one.\n\nC.J. Anderson, suddenly worthy of opponents\u2019 attention after rushing for 167 and 168 yards in the Broncos\u2019 previous two games, found yards tough to come by Sunday against the Buffalo Bills.\n\nHe was running on a tender left ankle he sprained the previous week. But more than that, the Bills\u2019 front was stout.\n\nAnderson had made 11 carries for 38 yards when he was spelled a couple plays into the Broncos\u2019 opening second-half drive. Juwan Thompson came in and immediately caught a pass from Peyton Manning for 14 yards.\n\nOn the next play, Thompson broke outside around left end, made a terrific cutback in, and ran 47 yards to the Buffalo 24.\n\n\u201cI just hugged him and told him, thank you, because he got me down there,\u201d said Anderson, who scored on the possession. \u201cJuwan played a helluva game today.\u201d\n\nThe run was similar to the 20-yard run Thompson broke outside in the Broncos\u2019 first preseason game against Seattle this year, a 59-yard, six-carry performance that pretty much put Thompson on the season-opening roster.\n\n\u201cIt did bring a flashback to that moment,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cNow I\u2019ve got to finish it off and get it to the end zone.\u201d\n\nAnderson had been the Broncos\u2019 leading rusher the past five consecutive games. Thompson broke that streak Sunday with 63 yards on four carries. Anderson was held to 58 yards on 21 carries \u2014 although he scored his third touchdown of the game to finish off that drive Thompson set up.\n\nWhen a back gains 63 yards on four carries, the obvious question becomes: Why only four carries?\n\n\u201cC.J. starts off each series and he\u2019s been doing great,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cCan\u2019t take the ball out of his hands. When I get an opportunity to go in there, I try to make the most of it.\u201d\n\nThe Broncos used a third running back \u2014 Jeremy Stewart, who gained 1 yard on a goal-to-goal carry in the second quarter. Stewart was undrafted coming out in 2012, Anderson was undrafted in 2013 and Thompson went undrafted this year.\n\nMeanwhile, the Broncos\u2019 two drafted running backs \u2014 Montee Ball, a second-round pick in 2013 and Ronnie Hillman, a third-rounder in 2012 \u2014 were out with injuries.\n\nBall and Hillman might return to practice this week. Beating out the undrafted backs for playing time won\u2019t be so easy.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Juwan Thompson comes on strong spelling C.J.
