The Timberwolves have a handshake deal in place to send all-star forward Kevin Love to the Cavaliers, ESPN.com’s Brian Windhorst said on ESPN Radio on Monday.

“The deal is done but not done,” Windhorst said. “The teams have agreed, but they can’t say they have agreed and they can’t agree because we’re in this weird moratorium period, because you can’t Andrew Wiggins until the 23rd of this month.

“So, between now and then — which is what? 19 days? — could something happen? Could a team come in with a trade that maybe Minnesota doesn’t see? Yes, it could happen. Therefore, it is not done. But, essentially before the papers have been signed, there is a handshake agreement: Kevin Love to the Cavs, Andrew Wiggins to the Timberwolves, and I believe Thaddeus Young will end up in Minnesota, either as part of a separate deal or as part of a three-way deal. Possibly Anthony Bennett, who’s on the Cavs right now, could get re-routed to Philadelphia in part of a deal for Thaddeus Young, there will be draft picks involved.

“But essentially what you need to know if you’re an NBA fan: Kevin Love’s going to be on the Cavs barring anything unforeseen, and Andrew Wiggins, the No. 1 overall pick, is going to be in Minnesota.”

It has seemed inevitable for a while now — or soon after LeBron James announced his return to Cleveland — that Love would land on the Cavs. Timberwolves owner Glen Taylor told the Pioneer Press over the weekend that Love would likely be dealt on Aug. 23 or 24, a date that further hinted to a trade with Cleveland.

The Cavs signed Wiggins to a four-year deal on July 24, which prevented them from trading him for 30 days but made it easier for them to make a trade for Love once that period ends. Wiggins is set to earn $5.5 million next season, meaning the Cavs clear that much from their books when dealing him, helping to make room for a player like Love, who is due $15.7 million next season.
