They suggest Kentucky should adopt Right to Work to compete for jobs going to Indiana, which has a Right to Work law.\n\nBut one lesson some don\u2019t seem to want to learn is the lesson of Indiana\u2019s disastrous passage last year of its version of a Religious Freedom Restoration Act. Kentucky does not need to wade into those dangerous waters, yet that\u2019s exactly where the Kentucky Senate headed last week.\n\nConsider that about this time last year, large employers such as Angie\u2019s List said they would cancel expansion plans in Indiana. Organizations, including the NCAA, headquartered in Indianapolis, which was preparing for the Final Four at the time, pledged to pull future events from the state. Some governments banned travel to the state. The CEO of Apple voiced his opposition. The Twitter hashtag #boycottindiana became popular.\n\nAt the urging of Gov. Mike Pence, the GOP-led Indiana legislature modified the law to clarify it can\u2019t be used to undermine local \u201cfairness\u201d laws that prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation.\n\nSo why did the Republican-controlled Kentucky Senate on Tuesday pass Senate Bill 180? The bill\u2019s language leaves some room for its proponents to argue that it isn\u2019t as sweeping as Indiana\u2019s original law, but that\u2019s hardly clear. It certainly is aimed at negating the civil rights protections for LGBT adopted by eight forward-thinking Kentucky cities \u2014 Covington, Danville, Frankfort, Lexington, Louisville, Midway, Morehead and Vicco.\n\nWe applaud the six Senate Republicans who joined their Democratic colleagues in voting against SB180. We fully expect the measure either will not get a vote in the House or will be voted down handily, as it should be.\n\nWe\u2019d go a step further and encourage the General Assembly to take up SB176, rightly pointing the state in the correct direction.\n\nSen. Julie Raque Adams of Louisville, one of the Republicans voting against SB180, is also part of a bipartisan group that put forward SB 176, which they\u2019re calling the Kentucky Competitive Workforce Act.\n\nNearly 200 Kentucky employers in the Kentucky Competitive Workforce Coalition back the bill, including some of the commonwealth\u2019s largest employers as well as numerous small, locally owned companies. By the way, the Indiana Chamber of Commerce has taken a similar stand in the Hoosier state.\n\nSB176 would add to the Kentucky Civil Rights Act protections against discrimination to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people.\n\n\u201cWe need to show that we have the inclusive and competitive atmosphere where they want to live, where they want to work, and where they want to raise their families,\u201d said Sen. Morgan McGarvey, the Louisville Democrat who led the group sponsoring the bill.\n\nEconomic development isn\u2019t the only reason states should be extending protections to the LGBT community. It\u2019s the right thing to do in any case. But if that argument won\u2019t win over some legislators, then let\u2019s use the economic incentive to kill SB180 and move ahead on SB176.\n\nCourier-Journal, Louisville", "article_metadata": {"geo.region": "US-KY", "DC.rights": "Civitas Media", "geo.placename": "Harlan", "description": "Local News, Sports, Obituaries, and Classifieds for Harlan, KY", "author": "Harlan Daily Enterprise", "og": {"site_name": "Harlan Daily Enterprise", "description": "Some Kentucky politicians are fond of pointing to Indiana as a state from which the commonwealth can learn a lot (other than on the basketball co...", "title": "LGBT laws in Ky. - Harlan Daily Enterprise - harlandaily.com", "url": "http://http://harlandaily.com/opinion/9291/lgbt-laws-in-ky", "image": "harlandaily.com/images/fbimage.png", "locality": "Harlan", "type": "article", "region": "US-KY"}, "DC.type": "Text", "twitter": {"site": "@HarlanDaily", "description": "Some Kentucky politicians are fond of pointing to Indiana as a state from which the commonwealth can learn a lot (other than on the basketball co...", "card": "summary", "title": "LGBT laws in Ky. - Harlan Daily Enterprise - harlandaily.com"}, "DC.format": "text/html", "DC.contributor": "Harlan Daily Enterprise", "robots": "index, follow", "DC.publisher": "Harlan Daily Enterprise", "DC.identifier": "http://harlandaily.com", "DC.relation": "http://dublincore.org/", "DC.language": "en_US", "DC.description": "Some Kentucky politicians are fond of pointing to Indiana as a state from which the commonwealth can learn a lot (other than on the basketball co...", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "DC.title": "Harlan Daily Enterprise, Harlan KY - www.harlandaily.com"}, "article_summary": "Kentucky does not need to wade into those dangerous waters, yet that\u2019s exactly where the Kentucky Senate headed last week.\nSo why did the Republican-controlled Kentucky Senate on Tuesday pass Senate Bill 180?\nThey suggest Kentucky should adopt Right to Work to compete for jobs going to Indiana, which has a Right to Work law.\nSB176 would add to the Kentucky Civil Rights Act protections against discrimination to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people.\nConsider that about this time last year, large employers such as Angie\u2019s List said they would cancel expansion plans in Indiana."}
