Religious leaders and conservative politicians have been forced by the power of public opinion to apologize for trying to justify Farkhunda\u2019s killing. At least one official has been sacked for saying the woman would have deserved her brutal death if she had indeed burned the Muslim holy book.\n\nAt last week\u2019s Kabul vigil, candlelight illuminated a huge poster of Farkhunda\u2019s blood-reddened face as an actor recited Shakespeare\u2019s \u201cSeven Ages of Man\u201d, followed by performances of works commemorating her death. Outside, documentary filmmaker Diana Saqeb broke down: \u201cI don\u2019t believe in the humanity of this country anymore,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIt has been more than 10 days, but still I can\u2019t sleep, I can\u2019t eat. These people are killers, no different to the Taliban or Daesh who also kill people in the name of God,\u201d Saqeb said, referring to an alternative acronym for the Islamic State group.\n\nThe rule of law, said human rights activist Nader Nadery, is in the ascendancy. \u201cThis is a turning point for civil liberties that is real. It will be difficult to return to the former status quo when only self-proclaimed religious leaders held the high moral ground at the expense of justice and the constitution,\u201d he said. \u201cIf this struggle continues, the outcome will be what the country needs, to make rule of law clear and have religion understood in its place within the context of the law.\u201d\n\nFarkhunda, a 27-year-old religious scholar who like many Afghans used only one name, was killed on March 19 after an argument with a peddler at Kabul\u2019s Shah-Do Shamshira mosque. According to witnesses, she told the man to stop selling amulets to childless women; he shouted to whoever could hear that she had set fire to a Quran. As police watched, and at times participated, Farkhunda was punched, kicked, hit with planks of wood, thrown from a roof, run over by a car and crushed with a block of concrete. Her body was then dragged along a main road, thrown onto the banks of the Kabul River and set alight.\n\nThe incident, filmed on cellphones and posted on social media, sparked nationwide demonstrations \u2014 and vigils around the world. The Interior Ministry says it has arrested 28 suspects and dismissed 19 policemen. Investigations by a presidential commission, which declared Farkhunda innocent of Quran burning, continue. On Thursday, the government ordered the mosque closed until further notice.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Afghan woman killed by mob becomes icon for justice, rights", "title": "Afghan woman killed by mob becomes icon for justice, rights", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Afghan woman killed by mob becomes icon for justice, rights", "title": "Afghan woman killed by mob becomes icon for justice, rights", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/04/05/afghan_woman_killed_by_mob_becomes_icon_for_justice_rights/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/afghanistan-mob-killing.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Afghan woman killed by mob becomes icon for justice, rights", "title": "Afghan woman killed by mob becomes icon for justice, rights", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/afghanistan-mob-killing.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Lynne O'donnell", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Her body was then dragged along a main road, thrown onto the banks of the Kabul River and set alight.\nActivists say the previously unquestioned power of the religious establishment is being challenged for the first time in Afghanistan\u2019s modern history.\nReligious leaders and conservative politicians have been forced by the power of public opinion to apologize for trying to justify Farkhunda\u2019s killing.\nAt least one official has been sacked for saying the woman would have deserved her brutal death if she had indeed burned the Muslim holy book.\nOutside, documentary filmmaker Diana Saqeb broke down: \u201cI don\u2019t believe in the humanity of this country anymore,\u201d she said."}
