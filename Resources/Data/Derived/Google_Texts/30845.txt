Fans planning to pack the stadium for Sunday nightâ€™s Broncos game better bundle up, as forecasters say snow is likely.

A 70 percent chance of snow is expected in Denver during the game, said Robert Koopmeiners with the National Weather Service.

The game against the New England Patriots starts at 6:30 p.m.

Three inches of snow are predicted to fall by Monday morning, Koopmeiners said.

Temperatures will be in the low to mid teens on Sunday evening, so warm, spirited gear should be sported as crowds watch the game unfold.

The rest of Saturday is expected to be cloudy with highs in the upper to mid 20s, Koopmeiners said.
