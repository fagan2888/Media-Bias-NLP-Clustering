Meantime, key Republicans in Congress have taken up the mantle of over-the-counter birth control, partly to weaken the Democratic rallying cry that the GOP is waging a \u201cwar on women.\u201d\n\nBut that bipartisan support doesn\u2019t mean that over-the-counter birth control will be available nationwide anytime soon.\n\nInstead, the idea has gotten bogged down in debates over Obamacare and contraceptive coverage, with both Democrats and Republicans hoping to score some political points with their own proposals rather than working together. For the near future, state-level efforts like those on the West Coast may be the only progress on the issue.\n\nSign up for and more view example\n\nOn a policy level, over-the-counter birth control comes from a change in thinking on how often women should see their gynecologists. Doctors used to recommend that all women get an annual pap smear to screen for cervical cancer, but in 2012 those the official guidelines were changed to suggest women only need to be screened once every three years. Since annual pap-smear appointments are often when women get their birth control prescriptions refilled, removing the annual screening means women have to make a trip to the doctor just for the prescription alone.\n\nUnder the new rules in California and Oregon, women could consult with their pharmacist and fill out a brief questionnaire to make sure there aren\u2019t any health concerns, and then get their birth control on the spot.\n\nOn a political level, the idea is largely a pushback against the successful 2012 Democratic attack line that Republicans as waging a \u201cwar on women.\u201d A month after the election, then-Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal wrote an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal calling for hormonal contraception to be available over the counter. \u201cAs a conservative Republican, I believe that we have been stupid to let the Democrats demagogue the contraceptives issue and pretend, during debates about health-care insurance, that Republicans are somehow against birth control,\u201d he wrote. Colorado Republican Cory Gardner ran with the idea in 2014, helping beat a Democratic opponent who was using the 2012 playbook on women\u2019s issues.\n\nNow in Congress, Gardner and fellow Republican Sen. Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire have proposed a bill that would allow over-the-counter contraceptive access. Their bill would give pharmaceutical companies incentives to lobby the Food and Drug Administration to approve over-the-counter sale of hormonal birth control to patients over 17, which Gardner calls a \u201ca policy solution, not a political talking point.\u201d The bill would fast-track applications to the FDA and waive the filing fee, so that companies could seek approval to sell oral contraceptives without a prescription.\n\nRead More: Pharmacists in California and Oregon to Prescribe Birth Control\n\nGardner says his over-the-counter birth control plan would allow women to have \u201c24/7 access to birth control, on their time,\u201d and that Democrats who oppose the idea are just scared of losing one of their most effective talking points.\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re successful in passing our bill, than it takes away the political attack from the Democrats, and they\u2019re desperately afraid of that,\u201d Gardner says. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame that they\u2019re so desperate to lose a political attack that they\u2019re not willing to pursue good policy.\u201d\n\nBut reproductive rights groups are skeptical, arguing that the Republican bill is a sneaky way to undermine hard-won victories on contraceptive coverage. Since prescription birth control is counted as preventive medicine under the Obamacare, it\u2019s available without a copay\u2014and it\u2019s unclear whether that coverage would remain under this version of the bill. And the bill proposed by Gardner and Ayotte has an age limit and an ID requirement, which could make it difficult for young or undocumented women to access contraception, according to Megan Donovan, Federal Policy Counsel at the Center for Reproductive Rights, an advocacy organization.\n\nThat\u2019s why the Center for Reproductive Rights and Planned Parenthood support a competing bill proposed by Senator Patty Murray (D-Wa.) which would require health insurance to cover birth control pills even if they\u2019re sold over the counter, expanding the contraceptive mandate to birth control without a prescription.\n\n\u201cThe Gardner-Ayotte bill is a Trojan horse,\u201d says Dawn Laguens, executive vice president of Planned Parenthood Action Fund. \u201cIt may claim to expand access, but the reality is it would give women fewer birth control options and force them to pay twice for their birth control.\u201d\n\nGardner dismisses that criticism as politicized, saying there\u2019s nothing in the bill that changes the way prescriptions work. \u201cPeople could still go seek a prescription if they like,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are not telling people not to go to the doctor.\u201d\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has come out in support of over-the-counter contraception in an interview, although she didn\u2019t specify which version she\u2019d endorse. \u201cI think that over-the-counter birth control is a real possibility that will make drugs more available and more cheaply,\u201d she said in an interview with CBS. \u201cI think pharmacists can play a role in that, but I also think that over-the-counter is entirely appropriate.\u201d\n\nHow to pay for it, of course, is another question entirely.\n\nRead Next: The Long, Strange History of Birth Control", "article_metadata": {"description": "Despite new laws in California and Oregon.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "Despite new laws in California and Oregon.", "title": "Why Over-the-Counter Birth Control Is Stalled", "url": "http://time.com/4132835/why-over-the-counter-birth-control-is-stalled/", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/top-ten-politicos-watch-2016-10.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "TIME", "image": {"src": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/top-ten-politicos-watch-2016-10.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012"}, "description": "Despite new laws in California and Oregon.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Why Over-the-Counter Birth Control Is Stalled"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "keywords": "california, oregon, over the counter, prescription, birth control, reproductive health, bobby jindal, cory gardner, kelly ayotte, patty murray", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/time"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "california, oregon, over the counter, prescription, birth control, reproductive health, bobby jindal, cory gardner, kelly ayotte, patty murray"}, "article_summary": "Meantime, key Republicans in Congress have taken up the mantle of over-the-counter birth control, partly to weaken the Democratic rallying cry that the GOP is waging a \u201cwar on women.\u201dBut that bipartisan support doesn\u2019t mean that over-the-counter birth control will be available nationwide anytime soon.\nwhich would require health insurance to cover birth control pills even if they\u2019re sold over the counter, expanding the contraceptive mandate to birth control without a prescription.\n\u201cI think that over-the-counter birth control is a real possibility that will make drugs more available and more cheaply,\u201d she said in an interview with CBS.\nRead More: Pharmacists in California and Oregon to Prescribe Birth ControlGardner says his over-the-counter birth control plan would allow women to have \u201c24/7 access to birth control, on their time,\u201d and that Democrats who oppose the idea are just scared of losing one of their most effective talking points.\nSign up for and more view exampleOn a policy level, over-the-counter birth control comes from a change in thinking on how often women should see their gynecologists."}
