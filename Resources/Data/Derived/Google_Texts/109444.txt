The Easter Egg Hunt at Middleton Place is fun for everyone.

Today families across the Lowcountry are invited to visit Middleton Place for their annual Easter Eggstravaganza.

The event gives kids a chance to take part in an exciting day of Easter traditions, including the massive egg hunt.

Children will need a basket for the egg hunts in the Gardens.

After finding the hard-boiled eggs, kids can take them to the Stableyards to be dyed.

In addition to the egg hunts, there will be games, an egg roll and egg toss, story-telling, and arts and crafts.

Gates open at 9 a.m., and the activities are free with general admission.

The 'Eggastravaganza' will begin and 10 a.m. and last until 1 p.m., click here for more information.
