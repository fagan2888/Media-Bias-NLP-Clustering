On Saturday, that orange-clad regimen took over two sections at Coors Field just outside the foul pole in left. They screamed \u201cLet\u2019s Go Mets\u201d even before the first pitch, and loud enough to carry throughout LoDo. The only noise that eventually drowned them out were boos from Rockies fans.\n\nSunday morning, I asked Rockies manager Walt Weiss if it \u201cbugged\u201d him when opposing fans dominated the atmosphere at Coors Field. He answered with truth \u2026 and a bit of humor.\n\n\u201cYeah, absolutely,\u201d Weiss said. \u201cWell, New Yorkers are louder than everybody else. So 100 New Yorkers are the equivalent to about 10,000 Mets fans. And that\u2019s coming from a New Yorker.\n\n\u201cBut yes, it does, it bothers us. Teams with a lot of history come in here \u2026 I think we have seen that a handful of times this year. But to answer your question, yes, it does bother us.\u201d\n\nStar third baseman Nolan Arenado, however, provided a different answer to the question.\n\n\u201cI kind of like it. I really don\u2019t mind it,\u201d he said. \u201cI like that the crowd is loud. I\u2019m OK with them being loud.\u201d\n\nEven if it\u2019s the opposition\u2019s fans doing the cheering?\n\n\u201cYeah, because then I think it gets Rockies fans motivated at the same time,\u201d Arenado said. \u201cThey start getting fired up, so I don\u2019t mind it. But at the end of the day I hope our fans are louder than theirs.\u201d\n\nArenado then pointed out a game in St. Louis earlier this month when a contingent of purple-clad Colorado Boy Scouts filled up two sections of Busch Stadium and started chanting \u201cLet\u2019s go Rockies!\u201d\n\n\u201cRemember that? That was awesome,\u201d Arenado said.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Coors Field,Mets fans,Nolan Arenado,Walt Weiss", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"site_name": "On the Rox", "description": "Sunday morning, Rockies manager Walt Weiss was asked if it \"bugged\" him when opposing fans dominated the atmosphere at Coors Field.
