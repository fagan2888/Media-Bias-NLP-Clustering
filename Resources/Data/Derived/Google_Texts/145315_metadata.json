Pat Toomey won\u2019t be easy, and the Pennsylvania Democrats vying for the party nomination will first have to figure out how to capture voters\u2019 imagination.\n\nNone of the three \u2014 Joe Sestak, Katie McGinty and John Fetterman \u2014 are household names or have held statewide office. They are also virtually identical on bedrock Democratic Party issues, from supporting the Affordable Care Act and abortion rights to backing President Barack Obama on immigration reform and climate change.\n\nWith less than five months until the April 26 primary, the unpredictable mood of the electorate may determine how Democrats will choose among the candidates, analysts and party strategists said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you can rule that out as a motivating factor if the candidates don\u2019t have enough to differentiate themselves,\u201d said Terry Madonna, a pollster and political science professor at Franklin & Marshall College in Lancaster.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRegistered Democrats outnumber Republicans in Pennsylvania by a 4-3 ratio, and beating Toomey will be of the utmost importance for Democrats to retake control of the Senate. The race is expected to be nationally watched, with tens of millions of dollars pouring in, mostly for TV ads.\n\nFor now, Toomey appears to be uncontested in the primary and backed by a unified Republican Party.\n\nEach of his potential Democratic foes has strengths.\n\nIn a sense, Sestak, 64, never stopped running for a rematch with Toomey. He retired from the Navy in 2006 after reaching the rank of vice admiral and went on to serve two U.S. House terms from Delaware County. In 2010, Toomey beat him by 2 percentage points, but he built a volunteer network and he has maintained good will among rank-and-file Democrats after becoming a regular on the local party event circuit.\n\nThe ability to raise money will be of prime importance, and McGinty, 52, could be the Democrats\u2019 best fundraiser. Senior party officials and donors recruited her and she has strong connections to top Democrats \u2014 she served as a top aide to former Gov. Ed Rendell, current Gov. Tom Wolf and in the Clinton White House. She ran for governor in 2014, finishing fourth in the four-way primary.\n\nFetterman is a newcomer to statewide electoral politics and virtually unknown in eastern Pennsylvania, but he is a national media darling for his unconventional efforts to revive the impoverished, dying Pittsburgh-area steel town of Braddock where he has been mayor since 2005. The 46-year-old is also bound to be popular with younger voters: He\u2019s 6\u20198\u201d, tattooed with a shaved head and goatee, and is most often seen in a black Dickey\u2019s work shirt, cargo shorts and work boots.\n\nThe shrinking middle class is a key campaign focus of all three candidates, and Fetterman isn\u2019t pulling punches in his efforts to highlight his career in Braddock.\n\n\u201cThey say they\u2019re for the middle class, but I\u2019m not sure what in their professional background supports that,\u201d Fetterman said.\n\nFor McGinty, her parents\u2019 blue-collar roots are a prominent theme.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in this race to stand with working families and to rebuild the middle class,\u201d McGinty said. \u201cIt\u2019s personal for me. As the ninth of 10 kids and the first in my family to go to college, I\u2019ve been privileged to live the American dream.\u201d\n\nSestak\u2019s campaign makes much of the theme that he is \u201cwalking in your shoes\u201d after he kicked off his campaign last spring by walking across the state.\n\n\u201cI wanted to show people that I would walk in their shoes and understand their hopes and concerns, their challenges,\u201d Sestak told a WILK-FM radio interviewer last month.\n\nThe middle class aside, Sestak could benefit if the fight against terrorism shapes the election. His national security credentials are a campaign emphasis \u2014 staff aides refer to him \u201cthe admiral.\u201d\n\nShould breaking the glass ceiling become a driving theme \u2014 and it could if Hillary Clinton seals the presidential nomination \u2014 that could favor McGinty. Pennsylvania has never had a female U.S. senator and men make up Pennsylvania\u2019s entire 19-member congressional delegation.\n\nIf the voters seek out a Bernie Sanders-style anti-politician, then Fetterman could be their man.\n\nIn the meantime, two important dates could help determine the relative strengths of the candidates: the Jan. 15 deadline to disclose their latest campaign fundraising performance, and Jan. 23, when state party committee members could consider a primary endorsement vote.\n\nFeb. 16 is the deadline to file enough signatures to get on the ballot.\n\n\u2022\n\nFACTS ABOUT PENNSYLVANIA\u2019S CANDIDATES FOR US SENATE\n\nA look at the backgrounds of the candidates running in the April 26 primary for the Democratic and Republican nominations for U.S. Senate:\n\n___\n\nNAME: Joe Sestak\n\nAGE: 64 (Dec. 12, 1951)\n\nPARTY: Democrat\n\nEDUCATION: B.S., U.S. Naval Academy (1974); master\u2019s degree, Harvard University (1981); Ph.D., Harvard (1984).\n\nEXPERIENCE: Officer (vice admiral), U.S. Navy, (1974-2006); White House director for defense policy (1994-97); U.S. representative, Pennsylvania\u2019s 7th District (2007-2011); unsuccessful candidate for U.S. Senate (2010); recipient, General Omar N.
