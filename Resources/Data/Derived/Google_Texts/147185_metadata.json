(AP) - Henry Rowan, whose 1992 gift of $100 million to what is now Rowan University was the largest ever to a public institution of higher education, has died. He was 92.\n\nRowan University spokesman Joe Cardona said Thursday Rowan died Wednesday at an assisted living facility in Bucks County, Pennsylvania.\n\nRowan and his wife, Betty Long Rowan, donated $100 million to what was then known as Glassboro State College.\n\nThe donation helped the college grow from a small school with fewer than 10,000 students to the state\u2019s second comprehensive public research university, with five campuses, more than 11 colleges and 16,100 students.\n\nThe gift also helped grow the school\u2019s assets from $787,000 to more than $177 million.\n\nGov. Chris Christie called Rowan \u201cone of the greatest philanthropists of our time\u201d in a statement, and Rowan University President Ali Houshmand said the school has lost a \u201cchampion of innovation and philanthropy.\u201d\n\n\u201cHenry Rowan\u2019s spirit will forever encourage our vision, animate our work and prompt us to make a difference in others\u2019 lives,\u201d Houshmand said in a statement.\n\nA native of Ridgewood, Bergen County, Rowan founded Inductotherm Group in 1953 along with his wife, Betty Long Rowan. The Rancocas-based company manufactures a variety of furnaces used in metal melting. Today the company and its sister firms employ 3,500 people in more than 20 countries.\n\nRowan graduated from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, but wanted to invest in a community where he felt it would have the biggest effect, according to the university.\n\nIn 1992, Glassboro State College\u2019s board voted to change the school\u2019s name to Rowan College after the Rowan donation. In 1996, the school began its engineering program and became a university the following year.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a fascinating man- one of the smartest people I ever met,\u201d said Anthony Lowman, dean of the engineering college. Lowman added that Rowan believed deeply in science, technology and engineering education and that he hopes the school is training \u201cthe next Henry Rowan.\u201d\n\nDuring World War II Rowan enlisted in the Army Air Corps as an aviation cadet and trained to become a bomber pilot, flying B-17s and B-29s, but the war ended before he could fly in combat.\n\nRowan was a pilot and sailor, a member of the Aviation Hall of Fame and a competitor in the 1992 Olympic Star Class sailboat racing trials in Miami.\n\nRowan\u2019s daughter, Virginia Smith, said most people knew her father because of the donation to the college, but he was also a big supporter of Boy Scouting and other educational institutions.\n\n\u201cMy father once said, \u2018Make a difference, make this world a better place because you lived in it.\u2019 It\u2019s safe to say he succeeded,\u201d she said in a statement.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Henry Rowan, whose 1992 gift of $100 million to what is now Rowan University was the largest ever to a public institution of higher education, has died.
