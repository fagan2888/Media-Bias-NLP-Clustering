A little law called ObamaCare that drastically hiked the cost of health insurance for working families may have had something to do with that.\n\nIs it raining outside? The Koch Brothers! Is it sunny outside? Why do the Koch Brothers hate the rain? Has Ukraine been invaded? Koch Brothers!\n\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) on Thursday accused Republicans of holding up crucial assistance to Ukraine in order to protect the Koch brothers. Reid tied the billionaires David and Charles Koch, who have bankrolled conservative causes, to GOP demands that language delaying the Internal Revenue Service\u2019s regulation of nonprofit political advocacy groups be added to the Ukraine package.\n\nHarry Reid is lying, as usual. The Koch Brothers can take care of themselves, but Obama's IRS goons targeted ordinary people to protect the Democratic Party.\n\nAnd assistance to the Ukraine wouldn't be held up if the Democrats hadn't, predictably, tried to shove other agendas in.\n\nThe Dems are pushing what they call IMF reforms, that would limit America's ability to keep it from making bad financial decisions.\n\n\u201cThe IMF money has nothing to do with Ukraine,\u201d Speaker John Boehner said Thursday. \u201cI understand the administration wants the IMF money but it has nothing at all to do with Ukraine. So let\u2019s just understand what the facts are here.\u201d\n\nSo it's the Dems who are holding up Ukraine aid by playing political games. The Republicans are putting their oar in, but the IMF \"reforms\" should not pass.\n\nMeanwhile Harry Reid is ranting about the Koch Brothers who gave him a wedgie last week and kept him on a broccoli diet.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to comprehend how with a clear conscience they could say, \u2018Ukrainians, we probably can\u2019t help you because we\u2019re trying to protect the Koch brothers,\u2019\u201d he said on Thursday. \u201cAnd not only that, they\u2019re saying to the American people that protecting the Koch brothers is more important than helping our country.\u201d\n\nUkraine might be Reid's country, but it's not our country. But Harry Reid operates on auto-pilot these days.\n\nBut if Reid really believes that aid to the Ukraine matters that much, he'll jettison the IMF pork.", "article_metadata": {"rating": "general", "description": "Is it raining outside?
