However, he also questions whether Congress has the collective fortitude to accomplish meaningful reform anytime soon.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a nonelection year for the House and Senate, but presidential politics has already reared its ugly head,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t know if there\u2019s political will to push something through Congress that would be major tax reform.\u201d\n\nMunn says some businesses might be holding off on equipment purchases and improvements because of uncertainty over the future of certain tax incentives.\n\nThe bonus depreciation provision, for example, is one of the expired tax provisions up for extension.\n\nThe provision, which had been renewed every year since the recession, had enabled businesses to write off up to 50 percent of the cost for new equipment and improvements for the year it was bought.\n\n\u201cBusinesses don\u2019t know if they want to spend $100,000 or more on fixed assets now or later,\u201d Munn says.\n\nAlso, under Section 179 incentives, the current maximum deduction for newly acquired assets has returned to $25,000, down from a maximum write-off in recent years of $500,000 for equipment and real estate purchases.\n\n\u201cAs it is, the Section 179 benefit is significantly lower,\u201d Munn says.\n\nA credit that enables companies to write off certain research-and-development expenses also has expired.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s never been made permanent, and it\u2019s always rolled over year to year,\u201d Munn says. \u201cFor a lot of companies locally, it\u2019s a really big credit for them annually.\u201d\n\nOther companies should look into the R&D credit if Congress extends it again, he advises.\n\n\u201cA lot of folks don\u2019t capture actual time that goes into R&D,\u201d Munn says. \u201cIt can be a big deal.\u201d\n\nIn some cases, an alternative of sorts for the Section 179 incentive can be applied using provisions of tangible property and repair regulations, Munn says. TPR regulations include safe-harbor provisions for certain supplies, repairs, and depreciable property, which can be expensed immediately rather than capitalized and depreciated over a number of operating cycles, he says.\n\nIn the safe-harbor provision for routine maintenance, for instance, costs for regular maintenance that keeps big-ticket equipment in working order can be expensed immediately Munn says.\n\nAlso as an alternative to bonus depreciation and Section 179 provisions, businesses might be able to expense large equipment orders if they can break them down into smaller units, he says. For instance, if a company were to buy $50,000 worth of computers valued at $2,500 each, it likely could invoice the computers at their individual values and expense all of them, he says.\n\nGreen says the state sales tax exemption also has expired, although it\u2019s among exemptions that have been extended annually in recent years.\n\n\u201cIt makes it hard for people who can itemize and are thinking about big-ticket purchases,\u201d he says.\n\nSome clients have made decisions earlier this year to buy big-ticket items such as a new car, Green says, adding, \u201cI can\u2019t tell them whether sales tax will be deductible or not.\u201d\n\nTax breaks would come at some cost to the government, he says.\n\n\u201cUnder normal budgeting rules, Congress has to figure out how to pay for extenders,\u201d Green says.\n\nBecause federal tax law has a permanent option to deduct state income tax, he says, \u201cFrom a fairness perspective, states that don\u2019t have state income tax would argue sales tax should be deductible.\u201d\n\nGreen says charities are hoping Congress extends the charitable rollover provision for older Americans who own individual retirement accounts.\n\nThe IRA charitable rollover would allow IRA owners aged 70 \u00bd years old and older to contribute directly to charities from their IRA accounts without having to report the distribution as income.\n\nThe IRA rollover would be especially useful for people who are required to make distributions from their IRAs at a certain age even if they have other sources of income, Green says.\n\n\u201cNow that personal-exemption and itemized-deduction phaseouts are back, it\u2019s a bigger deal,\u201d he says of the IRA rollover. The phaseouts for tax year 2015 are triggered when adjusted gross income exceeds $258,240 for individuals, and $309,900 for joint filers.\n\nMcDirmid says the rollover wouldn\u2019t just benefit rich donors. Older Americans with smaller IRAs could use the rollover provision to distribute some component to charity to reduce above-the-line income, he says.\n\n\u201cEvery time we run the numbers, whether large or small, having dollars directed out of required distributions to charity pencils out,\u201d McDirmid says.\n\nAffordable Care Act\n\nGreen says some provisions of the Affordable Care Act are still being rolled out.\n\nFor the 2015 tax year, certain ACA benefit recipients have to reconcile health care-premium tax credits and actual income levels.\n\n\u201cPeople not covered by employer plans and who might have availed themselves to the health care marketplace might have some surprises in store,\u201d Green says.\n\nThose who don\u2019t file 2015 tax returns won\u2019t be eligible for advance health-care premium credits for 2016.\n\nMcDirmid adds that for the current tax year, large employers have annual reporting responsibilities regarding health insurance they offer their full-time employees.\n\n\u201cThe mandate applies to entities with more than 100 full-time employees,\u201d McDirmid says. \u201cIn 2016, the mandate goes from 100 employees to 50. That change is going to grab a lot of entities.\u201d\n\nMcDirmid says his firm has been meeting with employer clients to evaluate whether they\u2019re complying with reporting requirements.\n\n\u201cMost have plans in place,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s the folks right on the line who are most nervous about it.\u201d\n\nMcDirmid says employers need to talk to their tax advisers to make sure everyone is up to date with ACA regulations.\n\n\u201cEven in the profession, I\u2019ve seen confusion over what needs to be done with the Affordable Care Act,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople need to reach out for help because it\u2019s fluid and there\u2019s some confusion over what needs to be done.\u201d\n\nEstate taxes\n\nMcDirmid says Washington state residents are much more likely to exceed the state estate tax threshold than the federal threshold.\n\nThe Washington estate tax exclusion is approaching $2.1 million for 2015. The estate tax ranges from 10 percent to 20 percent for values above the threshold.\n\nThe federal estate tax exclusion, which includes gifts bestowed during an individual\u2019s lifetime, is $5.4 million per individual with a 40 percent tax rate on estate values above that.\n\nWashington state has no gift tax, meaning some high-asset Washington residents could avoid the Washington estate tax by gifting highly appreciating assets before they die to keep their estates below the tax threshold.\n\n\u201cSomeone who\u2019s worth $3 million and who doesn\u2019t want the estate to pay state taxes can give $1 million to beneficiaries and get below $2 million,\u201d he says.\n\nAt the federal level, most people can get to zero estate tax liability, although that may require giving up control of assets and giving to charities, he says.", "article_metadata": {"robots": "noarchive", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The bonus depreciation provision, for example, is one of the expired tax provisions up for extension.\nUncertainty over the extensions compresses the tax preparation period, especially for Form 1040 filers, says Jason Munn, tax partner at the Spokane office of Seattle-based accounting firm Moss Adams LLP.\nThe federal estate tax exclusion, which includes gifts bestowed during an individual\u2019s lifetime, is $5.4 million per individual with a 40 percent tax rate on estate values above that.\nThe estate tax ranges from 10 percent to 20 percent for values above the threshold.\nThe Washington estate tax exclusion is approaching $2.1 million for 2015."}
