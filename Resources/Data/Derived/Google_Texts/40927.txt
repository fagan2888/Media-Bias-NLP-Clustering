An undercover video of the Obamacare application process released Wednesday reveals multiple counts of application fraud and the firing of another Obamacare navigator for advising enrollees to lie when applying for coverage.

Project Veritas released its fourth investigative video Wednesday documenting the recent firing of Obamacare Navigator Kris McKray, formerly of the non-profit community organization Change Happens Texas.

When asked why McKray was “let go,” Change Happens human resources representative Deborah Veals said, “There is a reason why he has been terminated.”

Veals told The Daily Caller, “I have nothing to do with what you’re speaking of so do not contact me again.”

Another Parkland Hospital Obamacare counselor, Maria Castro, was recorded telling an undercover Project Veritas applicant to falsify an application, saying, “Don’t claim that on your taxes, there’s no proof.”

A third Obamacare counselor, Tom Bertwanger, was captured on video telling an undercover Project Veritas investigator to “Just keep it real quiet.”

Parkland Hospital Media Relations Supervisor Catherine Bradley declined to give a comment to Project Veritas, but said they were prepared to give a statement if contacted by other media outlets.

This is the fourth in a series of videos by Project Vertias that have so far resulted in the firing of three Obamacare navigators, the resignation of a high-level communications director of Enroll America (a non-profit group dedicated to signing people up for Obamacare), and the demand to shut down the Obamacare navigator program by Republican Texas Sen. John Cornyn.

The East Dallas Health Center did not return a request for comment.
