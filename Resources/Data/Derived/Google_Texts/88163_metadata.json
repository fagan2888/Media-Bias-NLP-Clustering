She checked the box on HealthCare.gov saying she uses tobacco and fully expected to pay more for her insurance policy under the Affordable Care Act. \u201cIt\u2019s not a secret at all,\u201d she said.\n\nWetherby dutifully paid the premium Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield charged her for January and again for February 2014 and believed she had coverage effective on Jan. 1.\n\nThen when Wetherby went to pay her March premium, she was told she couldn\u2019t. A check arrived in the mail refunding her February premium with a two-word explanation: \u201cContract cancelled.\u201d\n\nTurns out, Wetherby was among about 100 smokers in New Hampshire caught up in a \u201ctechnical glitch\u201d that caused them to lose their new health insurance policies because they had been mistakenly charged non-smoking rates, according to the New Hampshire Department of Insurance.\n\nIt is unclear if the error affected smokers in other states served by Anthem.\n\nWetherby, 64, learned on Friday that her insurance was being reinstated, retroactive to Jan. 1, and that the original rate she was quoted 2014 about $26 a month after a big government subsidy 2014 would be honored throughout this year. She turns 65 in October and will then go on Medicare.\n\n\u201cWhen we were contacted by consumers who were experiencing application processing problems, we reached out to the carrier (Anthem), and worked with them to understand the factual situation,\u201d said insurance department spokeswoman Danielle Kronk Barrick. \u201cUltimately, Anthem agreed that it would honor the originally quoted nonsmoker rates for the remainder of 2014, even though Anthem believes the glitch was not of its making.\u201d\n\nStill, for the past month, Wetherby has been scrambling to find out what happened and get it fixed. She contacted Anthem, her governor, her Congresswoman, her senator and state insurance regulators. She set up a Twitter account to try to get someone\u2019s 2014 anyone\u2019s 2014 attention.\n\n\u201cHow can this be??\u201d she wrote to me. \u201cThe ACA guarantees coverage. I went to the ACA website and received a rate. Anthem has taken my premium for 2 months and undoubtedly they have taken the corresponding US government subsidy dollars, yet they tell me I am not covered. I read where Obamacare is covering millions but when I speak to the NH Insurance department I am told many people have the same issue as I do.\u201d\n\nAn official with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which oversees HealthCare.gov, said \u201cthis was an error committed by Anthem\u201d and that the insurer recently submitted revised data, which will soon be reflected in the online health plan comparison tool.\n\n\u201cCMS works to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the data issuers submit,\u201d agency spokesman Aaron Albright said. \u201cIssuers are also responsible for sending accurate and complete rating information to CMS.\u201d\n\nAcross the country, some of those signing up for coverage are finding out that their policies are not what they thought: Their physicians are not in their insurance network, their drugs aren\u2019t covered, or their copays are higher than expected. But Wetherby\u2019s case was different 2014 she was left with no insurance at all.\n\nWhile it is legal in many states to charge smokers more for insurance, it generally is not okay to cancel them based on an error made by the insurer.\n\nOfficials at Anthem, the lone Obamacare offering in New Hampshire, did not return multiple emails and phone calls seeking comment. In a letter last week to the insurance department about Wetherby\u2019s case, an analyst wrote that \u201cit was determined that when the policy was to be loaded there was a difference between the calculated rate and the quoted rate, so it was never effective.\u201d\n\nWetherby is exactly the type of person the ACA is intended to help. Retired in 2013, she lives on Social Security benefits and had been paying $400 per month for high-deductible coverage last year.\n\nOnce HealthCare.gov began working again in November, she logged on and signed up for coverage. Because her income is barely above the federal poverty limit, she qualifies for a huge federal subsidy 2014 $657 a month. She is also eligible for help paying her copays and deductibles.\n\nWhile Wetherby said she is healthy, she said she was nervous about not having insurance. When she canceled her old policy four days before the new one took effect, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t leave the house. I was so afraid I was going to get hurt.\u201d\n\nEven after what\u2019s happened, Wetherby said she remains a \u201cboisterous\u201d supporter of the ACA.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a long hard journey but I still believe in it because I believe that everyone should have insurance,\u201d she said. \u201cThe president has just put so much effort into this and I feel we still do have a lot of people in government who believe in this, and I myself believe in it.\u201d\n\nHave you tried signing up for health care coverage through the new exchanges?
