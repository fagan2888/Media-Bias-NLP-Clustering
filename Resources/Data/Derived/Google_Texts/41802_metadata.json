This has been a pretty prosperous time for the top two percent. For most Americans though \u2014 not so much.\n\nA new report from Sentier Research based on Census data finds that median household income of $56,700 at the end of 2015 stood exactly where it was adjusted for inflation at the end of 2007.\n\nThat\u2019s eight years of virtually zero income gain. And President Obama and his Washington political pundits wonder why voters are in such a cranky mood.\n\nLast week the Joint Economic Committee of Congress issued a report on the Obama recovery loaded with even more dismal news. On almost every measure examined, the 2009-15 recovery since the recovery ended in June of 2009 has been the meekest in more than 50 years.\n\nStart with the broadest measure of economic progress: growth in output. The chart below compares the Obama growth pace with that of the average recovery coming out of the last eight recessions and with the Reagan recovery and over the same number of months (77). Democrats used to disparage the Reagan expansion as nothing special, yet the growth rate over the first 25 quarters under Reagan was 34 percent versus 14.3 percent under Obama.\n\nHow much does this matter? If we had grown at an average pace, GDP in 2015 would have been about $1.8 trillion higher. Under the Reagan recovery growth would have been $2.7 trillion higher.\n\nIt is certainly true that every recession is different in cause and consequences, so the JEC dug deeper into the numbers. It examined GDP growth on a per-capita basis. The Reagan recovery was abnormally strong in part because it happened when millions of baby boomers swept into the work force adding to growth. But even on a per-capita basis, real GDP has grown only 9.0 percent versus 18.8 percent for the average recovery. That is the lowest of any post-1960 recovery.\n\nNext the JEC measured job market trends. Again we see a failing record. Yes, official unemployment of just over 5 percent today is very low. But that\u2019s the biggest lie in America \u2014 right up there with \u201cwe\u2019re from the government and we\u2019re here to help.\u201d\n\nThe distortion is due to the fact that 94 million people in America over the age of 16 aren\u2019t in the labor force. If job growth had been the same as the average recovery we would have at least 5 million more Americans working \u2014 which is nearly the size of the workforce in Pennsylvania.\n\nAmazingly, if we had had a Reagan-paced job recovery we would today have at least 12 million more Americans working. Job creators are still on strike and it\u2019s a result of EPA rules, Obamacare, tax hikes, and other assaults against business.\n\nWhen fewer people are working and wages are stagnant, incomes don\u2019t grow. That\u2019s the real sorry story of the Obama era. If the Obama recovery had been just average, in other words a C grade, JEC calculates that \u201cafter-tax per person income would be $3,339 (2009$) per year higher,\u201d families can no longer be fooled with happy talk about \u201chope and change.\u201d They feel the tough times.\n\nThe JEC\u2019s dreary conclusion tells the whole story of the era of Obamanomics: \u201cOn economic growth the Obama recovery ranks dead last.\u201d\n\nOne other statistic that stands out on the Obama record as we begin his last year in office. The debt is up to $16.5 trillion and by the he leaves office our indebtedness will be almost double where it was when he entered the Oval Office. Just the interest payments alone cost half a trillion dollars a year. This is the Obama legacy and if liberals want to take ownership of this bleak record \u2014 it\u2019s all theirs.\n\n\u2022 Stephen Moore is an economic consultant with Freedom Works and a Fox News contributor.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The stock market closed down for 2015 reversing one of the few positive accomplishments under the Barack Obama presidency.
