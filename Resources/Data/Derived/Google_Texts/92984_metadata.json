Only nuggets sold in the 5 lb. bags are under scrutiny; ones that are sold in smaller packages will not be recalled.\n\nAfter receiving complaints of small pieces of plastic in the nuggets \u2014 as well as the report of a minor mouth injury after someone ate a nugget \u2014 the firm decided to recall the products. According to the company, the contaminated nuggets were produced on two days at one particular production plant. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) reported that a product scraper inside a blending machine caused the plastic to get stuck in the meat.\n\nSeveral months ago, Tyson Foods Inc. recalled over 33,000 pounds of \u201cmechanically separated\u201d chicken products after a Salmonella scare. This particular product was not sold in consumer markets across the nation, however. Another recent Salmonella outbreak occurred at Foster Farms, which sickened over 400 people in 23 states. Foster Farms, however, did not recall the chicken; they claimed that the people got sick because they didn\u2019t cook the chicken properly.\n\nAlong with the 5 lb. bags of frozen, white meat, fully-cooked chicken nuggets, Tyson will be recalling 40 cases of Spare Tire brand fully-cooked nugget-shaped chicken breast pattie fritters with rib meat (Item # 16142-861, sold in 20 lb. bulk cases).\n\nThe product identifiers for \u201cTyson Fully Cooked White Meat Chicken Nuggets\u201d are below:\n\nUPC: 0-23700-02178 6 or 300-23700-02178 7\n\nItem # 16142-928\n\nManufacturer\u2019s Code: 0264SDL0315 through 0319 or 0474SDL0311 through 0314\n\n\u201cBest if used by\u201d dates of Jan 26, 2015 or Feb 16, 2015", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "tyson foods inc, tyson recall, chicken nuggets recall", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Tyson, Inc. has recalled 75,000 bags of its wholly-cooked, frozen chicken nuggets after receiving complaints of bits of plastic in the meat.", "title": "Tyson Recall: 75,000 Frozen Chicken Nuggets Recalled For \u2018Foreign Matter\u2019", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/tyson-recall-75000-frozen-chicken-nuggets-recalled-after-foreign-matter-plastic-discovered-meat", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/04/05/chicken-nuggets.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Tyson, Inc. has recalled 75,000 bags of its wholly-cooked, frozen chicken nuggets after receiving complaints of bits of plastic in the meat.", "title": "Tyson Recall: 75,000 Frozen Chicken Nuggets Recalled For \u2018Foreign Matter\u2019", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/tyson-recall-75000-frozen-chicken-nuggets-recalled-after-foreign-matter-plastic-discovered-meat", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/04/05/chicken-nuggets.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/04/05/chicken-nuggets.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-04-05T17:05:47-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-04-05T17:05:47-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Tyson, Inc. has recalled 75,000 bags of its wholly-cooked, frozen chicken nuggets after receiving complaints of bits of plastic in the meat."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf658\"", "article_summary": "Tyson, Inc. has recalled 75,000 bags of its wholly-cooked, frozen chicken nuggets after receiving complaints of bits of plastic in the meat.\nSome 75,000 Tyson chicken nuggets have been recalled after reports of finding the meat contaminated with \u201cforeign matter.\u201dTyson Foods Inc. has announced that it is recalling the 5 lb.\nbags of frozen chicken meat that have been sold throughout Sam\u2019s Club locations across the nation.\nbags of frozen, white meat, fully-cooked chicken nuggets, Tyson will be recalling 40 cases of Spare Tire brand fully-cooked nugget-shaped chicken breast pattie fritters with rib meat (Item # 16142-861, sold in 20 lb.\nOnly nuggets sold in the 5 lb."}
