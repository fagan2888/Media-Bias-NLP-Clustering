Paul LePage on Friday called a proposed expansion of Medicaid \u201csinful\u201d during an appearance in Kennebunk, his starkest condemnation of the plan yet.\n\nThe comment, first reported in the York County Coast Star, drew criticism from his two challengers for governor, Democratic 2nd District Rep. Mike Michaud and independent Eliot Cutler.\n\nVideos Additional Photos Gov. Paul LePage laughs with supporters as he delivers a box of petitions to get his name on the November ballot, at the Secretary of State's office Friday in the Cross State Office Building in Augusta. Joe Phelan / Kennebec Journal Gov. Paul LePage delivers signed petitions Friday in Augusta to get his name on the ballot for re-election.

LePage is calling it sinful,\u201d Michaud said in a statement. \u201cI don\u2019t know how he explains that to the 70,000 Mainers \u2013 including nearly 3,000 veterans \u2013 who are counting on him to do the right moral thing and sign the bipartisan Medicaid expansion plan into law.\u201d\n\nThree members of the governor\u2019s staff did not return calls and emails requesting clarification about the remark Friday evening.\n\nLePage\u2019s appearance in Kennebunk, in which he visited three businesses and discussed economic incentives with town and business leaders, came on the same day he handed in signatures to place his name on the primary ballot.\n\nMichaud submitted signatures Wednesday. The deadline is Monday. Cutler, who does not have to run in a primary, will submit signatures closer to the November election.\n\nAfter he returned to the State House in Augusta, a group of LePage campaign volunteers cheered as the governor and his staff walked to the nearby Secretary of State\u2019s Office to deliver the cardboard box containing the petitions.\n\nThe group of about 40 supporters chanted \u201cFour more years!\u201d and LePage thanked individual volunteers and smiled broadly for the cameras. He did not make any public statement before heading into a private reception for roughly three-dozen signature gatherers held at the Blaine House.\n\nDespite the official step Friday, LePage has been preparing his re-election campaign for months, raising hundreds of thousands of dollars. And the governor and his supporters have so far set the tone for the campaign by talking often about the economy and, more specifically, about Medicaid expansion and welfare abuse.\n\nMichaud and Cutler also have been raising money, setting up campaign organizations and making appearances.\n\nAmong supporters who greeted the governor were Victoria and Fred Bucklin of Appleton, who went door to door for LePage to gather some of the estimated 3,000 signatures turned in Friday.\n\nThe couple said they have been impressed with the governor\u2019s record of fiscal responsibility and his effort to reform the Department of Health and Human Services, despite political and policy opposition from Democrats.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a businessman. He\u2019s not a politician,\u201d said Fred Bucklin. \u201cHe\u2019s trying to straighten government out.\u201d\n\nHis wife agreed.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s doing a great job,\u201d Victoria Bucklin said. \u201cI think the press has been incredibly biased.\u201d\n\nAnother supporter at first declined to be interviewed by the Press Herald, and hurried away to stand on the other side of the crowd. But the woman soon returned, saying she believed that media outlets in the state haven\u2019t given the governor a fair shake.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s brought a semblance of sanity to the state,\u201d said Terry Morris of Bangor. \u201cHe understands the state is broke, the country is broke.\u201d\n\nMorris said she is pleased with how he is clamping down on social benefits programs, and said the state ought to have stronger work requirements before handing out assistance.\n\n\u201cWhen I was young, benefits were for pregnant women and kids,\u201d said Morris, 65.\n\nShe said that people on the public dole shouldn\u2019t be spending the people\u2019s tax money at liquor stores, and decried the number of able-bodied people who utilize government assistance, some of them from out of state.\n\n\u201cWe should take care of our own people, not healthy young people,\u201d Morris said.\n\nMatt Byrne can be contacted at 791-6303, or at:\n\n\n\n[email protected]\n\n\n\nTwitter: @MattByrnePPH", "article_metadata": {"description": "Two challengers for the governor's seat criticize his comments made on the day he submits petitions to get on the ballot for re-election.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "description": "Two challengers for the governor's seat criticize his comments made on the day he submits petitions to get on the ballot for re-election.", "title": "Expanding Medicaid would be 'sinful,' LePage says - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/LePage.Phelan.jpg", "height": 476}, "url": "http://www.pressherald.com/2014/03/14/with-signatures-lepage-launches-re-election-bid/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Two challengers for the governor's seat criticize his comments made on the day he submits petitions to get on the ballot for re-election.", "creator": "@pressherald", "image": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/LePage.Phelan.jpg", "title": "Expanding Medicaid would be 'sinful,' LePage says - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "site": "@pressherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=951845858", "fb": {"admins": 769488179, "app_id": 178078215650057}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pressherald", "section": "Local & State", "tag": "state", "published_time": "2014-03-14T15:23:00-04:00"}, "google-site-verification": "QWs9pxQP8fwo2-nR5mWopc6qCK2D3920f7bl-U-zkso", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd35aa\"", "article_summary": "Paul LePage on Friday called a proposed expansion of Medicaid \u201csinful\u201d during an appearance in Kennebunk, his starkest condemnation of the plan yet.\nPaul LePage delivers signed petitions Friday in Augusta to get his name on the ballot for re-election.\nThe group of about 40 supporters chanted \u201cFour more years!\u201d and LePage thanked individual volunteers and smiled broadly for the cameras.\nLePage is calling it sinful,\u201d Michaud said in a statement.\nDespite the official step Friday, LePage has been preparing his re-election campaign for months, raising hundreds of thousands of dollars."}
