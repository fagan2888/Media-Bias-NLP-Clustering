With life expectancies rising and aging baby boomers trickling into retirement, pressure is bound to mount on entitlement programs.\n\nAlthough retirement spending, health care spending and interest spending is projected to go up, economists predict all other domestic spending will decrease over the next decade. But revenues are also expected to go down.\n\nAfter a short uptick to 18.9 percent of the GDP in 2016, gains are projected to fall to just 18 percent in 2021, with a rise in income taxes but a decline in other forms of revenue.\n\nFollow Juliegrace Brufke on Twitter\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
