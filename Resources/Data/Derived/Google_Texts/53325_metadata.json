He said while a New Jersey-only network won\u2019t work for all employers, many clearly are seeking less-expensive health care options.\n\n\u201cThere needs to be more competitive, lower cost (health plans) in the marketplace that employers can take advantage of,\u201d Cerniglia said. \u201cThere is the rising cost of health care, and we need to find ways to lower that cost.\u201d\n\nThe Garden State network has 13 different plan designs that follow the Affordable Care Act guidelines for the different benefit levels: bronze, silver, gold and platinum.\n\nClick here to sign-up for NJBIZ's email news blasts\n\nCerniglia said for some New Jersey employers \u201cthis will be the perfect option for them.\u201d The rising cost of health care has prompted employers to consider dropping health coverage and \u201cThis could be the defining line of offering coverage or not offering coverage if it hits the right price point.\u201d\n\nInsurance broker David Oscar of Altigro in Fairfield said health insurers are moving to so-called \u201cnarrow networks\u201d that deliver lower premiums in exchange for restricting members to a smaller group of health care providers. He said he will analyze the Garden State Network and determine if it would help his clients.\n\n\u201cAt first glance, it looks like it would be worth it to investigate this,\u201d Oscar said.\n\nHe said one client, a business with 30 employees, would save $4,000 a month in health care premiums by switching to the Garden State Network. Oscar said he needs to determine if the client will be satisfied with the providers in the new network, and with any changes in plan design that go along with making the switch, but \u201cIf you are talking about $4,000 a month, that is not a shabby number.\u201d\n\nUnitedHealthcare has about 1.5 million members in New Jersey, the majority of them in employer-based health plans. Cerniglia said existing clients may switch to the Garden State Network, which he predicted will also bring new business to the company.\n\n\u201cI can tell you that we\u2019ve had an overwhelming response from brokers in the community.\u201d He said hundreds of brokers have taken part in webinars \u201cto learn more about these products.\u201d\n\nALSO ON NJBIZ:\n\nMeadowlands business leaders offer $1.2B plan for sports complex that includes casinos, hotels and more\n\nMeadowlands Hospital names new CEO; denies report Considine will go to TruPlan\n\nAffordable housing fee remains in limbo as latest suspension bill sits on Christie's desk", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "NJBIZ", "description": "UnitedHealthcare's Oxford division is launching a New Jersey-only network of doctors and hospitals that will provide lower-cost health plans to employers who use the 18,000 doctors and 65 hospitals i", "title": "UnitedHealthcare's Oxford starts N.J.-only health care network | NJBIZ", "url": "http://www.njbiz.com/article/20140820/NJBIZ01/140829979/unitedhealthcares-oxford-starts-njonly-health-care-network", "image": "http://www.njbiz.com/images/njbiz-logo-share.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "njbiz.com", "description": "UnitedHealthcare's Oxford division is launching a New Jersey-only network of doctors and hospitals that will provide lower-cost health plans to employers who use the 18,000 doctors and 65 hospitals i", "creator": "@bethfitzgerald8", "image": {"src": "http://www.njbiz.com/images/njbiz-logo-share.jpg"}, "title": "UnitedHealthcare's Oxford starts N.J.-only health care network | NJBIZ", "site": "@njbiz", "card": "summary"}, "description": "UnitedHealthcare's Oxford division is launching a New Jersey-only network of doctors and hospitals that will provide lower-cost health plans to employers who use the 18,000 doctors and 65 hospitals in the new Oxford Garden State Network.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc3ca\"", "article_summary": "UnitedHealthcare's Oxford division is launching a New Jersey-only network of doctors and hospitals that will provide lower-cost health plans to employers who use the 18,000 doctors and 65 hospitals in the new Oxford Garden State Network.\nHe said he will analyze the Garden State Network and determine if it would help his clients.\nHe said while a New Jersey-only network won\u2019t work for all employers, many clearly are seeking less-expensive health care options.\nHe said one client, a business with 30 employees, would save $4,000 a month in health care premiums by switching to the Garden State Network.\n\u201cThere needs to be more competitive, lower cost (health plans) in the marketplace that employers can take advantage of,\u201d Cerniglia said."}
