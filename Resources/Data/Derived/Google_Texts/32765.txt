A northern Colorado mountain pass has been closed for avalanche work.

The Colorado Department of Transportation blocked off a 38-mile-stretch of Colorado 14 from Custer Mountain to the town of Rustic Sunday afternoon.

The area is closed for crews to assess the risk of avalanches and mitigate potential dangers. A CDOT tweet indicates the pass was closed around 2 p.m.

CDOT spokesperson Mike Murray said crews wonâ€™t be able to access the area until Monday. He noted the pass will be closed for at least 24 hours.

According to the National Weather Service, the area has experienced high winds throughout the day and received about 12 inches of snow. Light flurries are expected later in the evening.

CDOT closed eastbound Interstate 70 at Vail for about an hour Sunday due to multiple accidents. When the highway reopened around 4 p.m., passenger vehicles were required to have snow tires or use chains/alternative traction.

CDOT also warns travelers to expect an 60 minutes extra travel time from Silverthorne to Denver.
