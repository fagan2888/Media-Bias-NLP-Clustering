Terms of the deal were not disclosed.\n\nDigital billboards allow the owners to make more revenue because they can sell more advertising spots that rotate every six or eight seconds. \"You can have eight to 10 advertisers at a given location as opposed to just one, so you're basically able to expand the inventory that you have to sell to your customer,\" says GTCR managing director Dave Donnini.\n\n\"They're not making a lot of new ones, so you have tremendous franchise value in these markets,\" Donnini says.\n\nRoswell, Georgia-based Adams Outdoor is also an outdoor advertising company. Under the terms of the deal, Adams will assume a minority ownership stake in Fairway, and CEO Kevin Gleason with CFO Abe Levine will lead Fairway. GTCR teams with industry leaders to grow portfolio company in an approach the firm calls the Leaders Strategy. The approach helped earn the firm Mergers & Acquisitions M&A Mid-Market Private Equity Firm of the Year for 2013.\n\nGTCR invested in Fairway from its 11th fund, which closed in 2014 with $3.85 billion in commitments. The firm and Adams plan to grow Fairway organically and through add-on acquisitions.\n\nEarlier in January, GTCR sold Premium Credit Ltd. for about $700 million to Cinven Partners LLP. In December, GTCR-backed AssuredPartners Inc. bought Barsonmead Partners.\n\nAcon Investments is a private equity firm that is headquartered in Washington, D.C.
