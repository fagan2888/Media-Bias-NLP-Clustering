Pow! Pow! Pow! Pow!\" Spencer-Robertson said.\n\nShe watched as everyone at the party, started running for safety -\n\n'\u201dPeople were panicking, screaming, running. People were saying 'Calm down, Calm down. Put it away, put it away,' and I was actually scared because I didn't know if people were going to be running this way and I\u2019ve got two little ones in the house,\u201d Spencer-Robertson said.\n\nPolice tell us a group of 4 or 5 men showed up to a party on south Erie. They weren't invited by the homeowner. Somehow a fight broke out and one of the men went to a car, grabbed a gun, and fired into the crowd.\n\nOne man was shot in the head but he's actually already out of the hospital. We spoke with him but he didn't want to be identified because the shooter is still on the loose.\n\n\u201cSeveral people were witnesses to the shooting and we do have some good leads. We are working on those right now,\u201d Sgt. Brad Elmore with the Wichita Police Department said.\n\nNo arrests have been made.\n\nOne other person suffered minor injuries in the scuffle and was treated at the scene.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "The shooting happened around 1 a.m. outside of a residence in the 800 block of South Erie.", "language": "english", "author": "KAKE News -", "og": {"description": "The shooting happened around 1 a.m. outside of a residence in the 800 block of South Erie.", "title": "UPDATE: Man Released From Hospital Following East Wichita Shooting", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/1-Injured-in-Northeast-Wichita-Shooting-228508281.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/iupl/846/CAC/846CAC2C88C34EE2A9F94A64B43714A3", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/3CA/8F0/3CA8F03FDC9E4CB38C241EED0800832F.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kake.com", "description": "The shooting happened around 1 a.m. outside of a residence in the 800 block of South Erie.", "title": "UPDATE: Man Released From Hospital Following East Wichita Shooting", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/1-Injured-in-Northeast-Wichita-Shooting-228508281.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/erie+shooting.jpg", "creator": "@KAKEnews", "site": "@KAKEnews", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "UPDATE: Man Released From Hospital Following East Wichita Shooting", "google-site-verification": "H0mev8O__gMqb34WcvOyZgBXFMRQZvDAQ0YTSGJ9hGQ", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "UPDATE Man Released From Hospital"}, "article_summary": "UPDATE: Sunday, October 20, 2013A 28-year-old man is recovering at a Wichita hospital following a shooting early Sunday morning at a party on the city's east side.\nShe watched as everyone at the party, started running for safety -'\u201dPeople were panicking, screaming, running.\n\u201cIt got louder and then we heard panic screaming and then I said I\u2019m calling 911 because that kind of screaming seemed more like people fighting,\u201d Elaine Spencer-Robertson said.\nThe shooting happened around 1 a.m. outside of a residence in the 800 block of South Erie, near Lincoln and Hillside.\nWhile Elaine Spencer-Robertson was putting Halloween decorations in her yard, she says what sounded like a normal party down the street at first suddenly made her want to call for help."}
