Empatica founder Rosalind Picard, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor and inventor, told Reuters the company has just started large clinical trials using its wristband device on individuals with depression.\n\nThe behemoths of the tech and healthcare industries are also chasing medical wearables. Dr. Jessica Mega, a former Harvard cardiologist who is now chief medical officer at Alphabet Inc\u2019s healthcare unit Verily, said at a recent digital health conference that the company plans to work closely with the FDA as it develops its own medical-grade devices.\n\nSoreon Research estimates the smart wearable healthcare market will grow from $2 billion in 2014 to more than $41 billion in 2020, with diabetes, sleep disorders, obesity and cardiovascular disease representing the biggest growth segments.\n\nTo win acceptance, though, medical wearables companies will need to do much more than reliably collect data from sophisticated sensors. They will also need to develop the analytical capabilities to make sense of it all, and prove in extensive studies that they can improve patient health.\n\n\u201cThe sensors are fantastic overall for collecting data,\u201d said Dr. Eric Topol, a digital health expert at the Scripps Translational Science Institute. It is the \u201cdata analytics and the clinical utility parts that most of the companies haven\u2019t figured out yet.\u201d\n\nWINDING ROAD\n\nEmpatica\u2019s experiences to date show the winding road that many digital health technologies follow before they arrive at an FDA-approved product.\n\nBesides tracking sleep, motion and heart rate, Picard\u2019s device tracks physiological stress by measuring skin conductance \u2013 changes in electrical signals in the skin that correlate with the sympathetic nervous system, which in turn regulates the \u201cfight or flight\u201d stress response.\n\nThe device was originally developed to detect stress in individuals with autism who have difficulty communicating their emotions. Picard became interested in epilepsy when a student in her lab borrowed a pair of the devices for his autistic brother, who had a grand mal seizure while wearing them.\n\nThe event produced a surprising spike in electrodermal activity on one side of the body that set Picard on the path of seizure detection.\n\nEmpatica raised $2 million last year in seed funding from angel investors, and more than $700,000 in an Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign for its first consumer device, called Embrace, which it hopes to start shipping early next year.\n\nThe company is also seeking FDA approval for its E4 device, a research-grade version for use in clinical trials. Empatica will use that to help gather evidence for future medical claims.\n\nPapanek likes that strategy, saying: \u201cYou can use the clinical trial platform to help validate the hardware and software that powers both the consumer and the industrial versions of their product.\u201d\n\nPicard ultimately hopes to develop a way to predict seizures based on patterns divined from data in her device, but that will take more study. For its first FDA application, Empatica wants to make a simple claim: that the device can reliably detect some types of epileptic seizures and send an alert to caregivers to check on them.\n\nSuch alerts might help prevent sudden unexpected death in epilepsy or SUDEP, which kills 1 out of every 1,000 patients with epilepsy. If seizures are uncontrolled, the risk of SUDEP jumps to more than 1 in 150, according to the Epilepsy Foundation. Death is typically preceded by seizure and most deaths occur when people are unattended.\n\nThere are several other epilepsy sensors on the market, such as Smart Monitor\u2019s SmartWatch, which detects repetitive shaking. Most are not covered by insurance because they are not FDA-approved, but that could soon change.\n\nAnoo Nathan, founder of Smart Monitor, said the company has done validation studies and is preparing for an FDA submission.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely part of our roadmap,\u201d she said.\n\nDr. Tobias Loddenkemper of Harvard Medical School\u2019s Boston Children\u2019s Hospital, who owns part of the Empatica patent, tests several different types of sensors. He hopes to do large studies using different combinations of sensors and drugs to find out which offer the best results for individual patients.\n\nLoddenkemper said he is in talks with unnamed drug companies to devise systems that would use wearables and other data to manage patients with epilepsy.\n\n\u201cIf we can prove these devices and warning systems are keeping patients out of the intensive care unit,\u201d he said, there is a chance that hospitals will pay for them.\n\nDATA RACE\n\nA key driver in the new wearables wave is the push for so-called value-based healthcare that is part of the Affordable Care Act. The law gives doctors and hospitals financial incentives for keeping large groups of patients healthy.\n\nUnder the old fee-for-service model, hospitals got paid when patients were hospitalized, noted Jody Ranck, a Washington, D.C.-based healthcare consultant.\n\n\u201cNow, you can lose money,\u201d he said.\n\nInstead, healthcare providers are now eager to collect the data that can help keep people out of the hospital \u2013 especially those with chronic diseases. \u201cThese wearables are just tools to get the health data,\u201d said Ranck.\n\nAn avalanche of studies \u2013 many of them taking advantage of new data-gathering platforms such as Apple Inc\u2019s HealthKit, Google\u2019s Google Fit and Samsung\u2019s SAMI \u2013 are under way on a number of chronic diseases, especially in the area of diabetes.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to see a lot of devices over the next couple of years for every chronic condition of mankind that are FDA-regulated because they all involve a treatment loop,\u201d Scripps\u2019 Topol said.\n\nVerily\u2019s Mega, speaking at a Scripps digital health conference in October, said companies will need deep analytics to tease out known signals, like fluctuations in glucose levels or abnormal heart rhythms such as atrial fibrillation.\n\nBut machine learning technologies will also make it possible to discover \u201cunknown signals,\u201d such as the significance of skin conductance for a variety of conditions.\n\n\u201cMaybe that\u2019s a much earlier signal of a heart attack than we actually know. These unknown signals take additional analytics,\u201d Mega said.\n\nAlso Read:\n\nWearables, recommendation engines will displace display advertising: Shapira, MassiveImpact CEO\n\nFossil Group-backed wearable-tech co Misfit launches jewellery with fitness tracker", "article_metadata": {"description": "Wearables that monitor serious diseases is moving from the labs to the market, transforming the treatment of conditions ranging from epilepsy to diabetes.", "og": {"site_name": "DealStreetAsia", "description": "Wearables that monitor serious diseases is moving from the labs to the market, transforming the treatment of conditions ranging from epilepsy to diabetes.", "title": "Insight - Beyond Fitbit: The quest to develop medical-grade wearables", "locale": "en_us", "image": "http://www.dealstreetasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/applewatch.png", "url": "http://www.dealstreetasia.com/stories/beyond-fitbit-the-quest-to-develop-medical-grade-wearables-24173/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A new wave of wearable computing devices that detect and monitor serious diseases is moving from the laboratory to the market, potentially transforming the treatment of conditions ranging from epilepsy to diabetes", "title": "Beyond Fitbit: The quest to develop medical-grade wearables", "image": "http://www.dealstreetasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/applewatch.png", "site": "@DealStreetAsia", "widgets": {"link-color": "#000000", "border-color": "#000000", "theme": "dark", "csp": "on"}, "partner": "tfwp", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 592239527568230}, "article": {"tag": "wearables"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "To win acceptance, though, medical wearables companies will need to do much more than reliably collect data from sophisticated sensors.\nLike many emerging wearables companies, Empatica hopes that its core technology will also find uses far beyond one specific medical condition.\nUnlike popular fitness-tracking devices, such as Fitbit Inc\u2018s Fitbit and Jawbone\u2019s UP wristbands, these so-called medical-grade wearables require approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration \u2013 a rigorous regulatory hurdle that first-generation wearables sought to avoid.\nThe behemoths of the tech and healthcare industries are also chasing medical wearables.\n\u201cThese wearables are just tools to get the health data,\u201d said Ranck."}
