(AP) - Aaron Rodgers dropped back and cocked his arm, ready to throw the ball downfield.\n\nInstead of flinging to his intended target, the Green Bay quarterback was flung to the ground, causing the ball to break loose from his grip.\n\nArizona defensive lineman Cory Redding scooped it up, tossed Packers running back Eddie Lacy to the ground and rumbled 36 yards for a touchdown.\n\nAnother big game, another big letdown for the Packers.\n\nRodgers was sacked eight times, had two fumbles returned for touchdowns and threw an interception in the end zone, sending the Packers to a disheartening 38-8 loss to the Cardinals on Sunday.\n\n\u201cWe are professionals. We have to hold ourselves to a higher standard and play better. Everybody has to play better,\u201d said Rodgers, who threw for 151 yards and a touchdown on 15-of-28 passing.\n\nThe Packers (10-5) had seemed to gather themselves over the past month, winning three straight after a stretch of four losses in five games that started with a blowout by Denver on Nov. 1.\n\nGreen Bay came into Sunday\u2019s game with a slight hope of earning a first-round bye in the playoffs, but it would have to start with a win over the Cardinals.\n\nThe Packers never really had a chance, unable to protect their quarterbacks behind an injury-riddled offensive line. Next up is the regular-season finale at home against Minnesota for the NFC North title after the Vikings cruised to a 49-17 victory against the New York Giants on Sunday night.\n\nTaking advantage of Green Bay\u2019s shoddy O-line, Arizona (13-2) had nine sacks, its most since 1986 and third-most in team history. Three of those were by resurgent veteran Dwight Freeney and Calais Campbell had 2 1/2.\n\nInstead of the Packers surging toward the playoffs, it\u2019s the Cardinals with the momentum after their ninth straight win clinched a first-round playoff bye.\n\n\u201cOur guys were just causing havoc,\u201d said cornerback Jerraud Powers, who had Arizona\u2019s second defensive touchdown.\n\nThe Packers had a hard time stopping it, right from the start.\n\nWithout starting left tackle David Bakhtiari (ankle) to protect him, Rodgers was sacked three times in the first half and threw for 58 yards while under constant pressure.\n\nGreen Bay\u2019s ground game did little to take the pressure off, its longest gain a 7-yard run by punter Tim Masthay on a fake.\n\nDespite everything that went wrong, the Packers appeared to gain a spark just before halftime, when defensive tackle Mike Daniels intercepted Carson Palmer\u2019s screen pass and rumbled to the Arizona 15-yard line.\n\nInstead of capitalizing on the Cardinals\u2019 first turnover in five games, Green Bay gave it right back when Rodgers threw a ball into the end zone that Justin Bethel intercepted.\n\nThe Packers compounded Rodgers\u2019 seventh interception of the season by allowing Michael Floyd to break free for a 47-yard reception on the next play. Palmer followed with a 7-yard touchdown pass to John Brown that put the Cardinals up 17-0 at halftime.\n\n\u201cThat was a huge swing,\u201d Packers coach Mike McCarthy said.\n\nIt got worse quickly for the Packers in the second half.\n\nJames Starks fumbled on Green Bay\u2019s first play, Arizona recovered at the Packers 28-yard line and David Johnson ran in for a 14-yard touchdown two plays later.\n\nThe Packers continued to have trouble protecting Rodgers and he started losing the ball.\n\nThe first fumble came on Kareem Martin\u2019s arm-flinging sack that led to Redding\u2019s touchdown.\n\nAfter a 28-yard touchdown pass to Lacy, Rodgers found himself on the ground again, this time in the hands of Freeney. He lost the ball again, Powers grabbed it out of midair and scored on a 7-yard touchdown to put the Cardinals up 38-8.\n\nGreen Bay pulled Rodgers with about 10 minutes left in the fourth quarter, its disaster in the desert complete.\n\n\u201cWe have a standard we have set around here for a long time and we just haven\u2019t lived up to it consistently,\u201d Rodgers said.\n\nNOTES: Cardinals S Rashad Johnson missed his second straight game with an ankle injury. Arizona also was without its other starting safety, Tyrann Mathieu, after he tore an ACL last week. \u2026 Green Bay DT B.J. Raji went out in the first half because of a concussion and did not return. \u2026 Arizona has had 19 different players to score a touchdown this season, most in the NFL. \u2026 Starks has four fumbles the past four games.\n\n___\n\nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL", "article_metadata": {"description": "Aaron Rodgers dropped back and cocked his arm, ready to throw the ball downfield.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Aaron Rodgers dropped back and cocked his arm, ready to throw the ball downfield.", "title": "Packers fall flat in NFC showdown, lose 38-8 to Cardinals", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/dec/27/packers-fall-flat-in-nfc-showdown-lose-38-8-to-car/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/12/27/packers_cardinals_football.jpeg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/12/27/packers_cardinals_football.jpeg", "description": "Aaron Rodgers dropped back and cocked his arm, ready to throw the ball downfield.", "card": "summary", "title": "Packers fall flat in NFC showdown, lose 38-8 to Cardinals"}, "Author": "JOHN MARSHALL", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "Green Bay pulled Rodgers with about 10 minutes left in the fourth quarter, its disaster in the desert complete.\n\u2026 Green Bay DT B.J.\nInstead of flinging to his intended target, the Green Bay quarterback was flung to the ground, causing the ball to break loose from his grip.\nGreen Bay came into Sunday\u2019s game with a slight hope of earning a first-round bye in the playoffs, but it would have to start with a win over the Cardinals.\nHe lost the ball again, Powers grabbed it out of midair and scored on a 7-yard touchdown to put the Cardinals up 38-8."}
