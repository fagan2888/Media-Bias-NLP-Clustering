Can consumers count on other cosmetic-making companies to do the same?\n\nMore than 100,000 consumers convinced Revlon to remove dangerous chemicals from their products, thanks to a petition organized by the EWG. Can consumers count on other cosmetic-making companies to do the same? Michelangelo Carrieri/CC BY-ND 2.0\n\nAsk, and ye shall receive paraben-free beauty products: Revlon announced on Thursday they will no longer use two long-chain parabens and DMDM hydantoin, a chemical that releases formaldehyde. The change comes after the non-profit Environmental Working Group (EWG) presented a petition signed by more than 100,000 consumers.\n\nTIME reported \u201clong-chain parabens have been linked to endocrine disruption, while formaldehyde may cause cancer.\u201d TIME added Revlon will also \u201creformat\u201d a product that contained butylparaben. This particular paraben is used as an antimicrobial preservative in products, such as eye shadow and foundation.\n\n\u201cWe are pleased that Revlon has acted to remove these toxic ingredients,\u201d Heather White, EWG Executive Director, said in a press release. \u201cLong-chain parabens and formaldehyde-releasing chemicals have no place in everyday cosmetic products. We applaud Revlon for taking these important steps and hope that other companies will follow Revlon\u2019s lead by reformulating their products to remove chemicals that have been linked to serious health problems.\u201d\n\nThe biggest win, White added, is the market-wide progress; Revlon is the latest to prove it\u2019s possible for companies to make their products without hormone-disrupting and otherwise toxic ingredients. However, there are still a handful major cosmetic companies who still include harmful ingredients in their products.\n\nSeparate research from the EWG found \u201cone in five of all (beauty) products contain chemicals linked to cancer; 80 percent contain ingredients that commonly contain hazardous impurities; and 56 percent contain penetration enhancers.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, Spa Finder reported cleaner, organic beauty products would trend more than before in 2014. Since the skin, the body\u2019s largest organ, absorbs 60 percent of what\u2019s topically applied, people are making a point to be more careful of what they put on their bodies, be it make-up or body wash. Back in 2012, the Natural Products Association reported a 50 percent increase in the certification of new natural products.\n\nYet the quality of beauty products has been under a microscope for years now. For example, in 2010, No More Dirty Looks: The Truth About Your Beauty Products was released and categorized as a \u201cwake-up call for all women who think that what you put on your body is not going to hurt you.\u201d The book exposed thousands of chemicals in everything from nail polish and condition, including a round-up of the cleanest make-up there is.\n\nSince then, the No More Dirty Looks blog keeps a running list of newly released (and clean) products for consumers to consider (among other healthy habits). Several magazines and blogs release annual clean beauty awards to keep with the consumer\u2019s demand to know what\u2019s in their beauty products \u2014 and which companies they can trust.\n\nThis trust-worthy list now includes Revlon. Who will be next?", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "revlon, removes, toxic, ingredients, beauty, products, following, petition, environmental", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "More than 100,000 consumers convinced Revlon to remove dangerous chemicals from their products, thanks to a petition organized by the EWG.
