Bernie Sanders of Vermont has struck many as oddly tone deaf as he struggles to overtake Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination.\n\nSanders was criticized by many pundits for pivoting too quickly in his opening remarks during the second Democratic debate on Nov. 14 from expressing shock and disgust over the attacks that killed 130 people to his signature campaign issue of fixing an economy that has been rigged by a billionaire class against average middle class Americans.\n\nRelated: Bernie Sanders Wants a New NATO, Including Russia, to Fight ISIS\n\nSince then, he has done little to broaden his campaign stump speeches to include his views on foreign policy and battling ISIS, even as Clinton, Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump and other GOP candidates escalate their rhetoric to promise tough, unflinching leadership in the war on terrorism. During a four-day swing through Georgia and South Carolina that ended Monday, Sanders said little about combatting ISIS unless specifically asked by reporters or members of the audience, according to The Washington Post.\n\nWhen he does volunteer his views on the global terrorism crisis, it\u2019s usually to say that the U.S. should participate in but not lead the military campaign in Syria and Iraq. \u201cIt is absolutely imperative that foreign policy and how we most effectively destroy ISIS become part of the campaign,\u201d Sanders told John Wagner of The Washington Post. \u201cThat\u2019s absolutely right. But obviously the fact that the middle class of our country continues to disappear, we have massive levels of wealth and income inequality, and we have a corrupt campaign finance system, that does not disappear because of the ISIS attacks. I will continue talking about those issues as well.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no question that income inequality and the evils of Wall Street are topics that helped the 74-year-old Sander\u2019s once improbable campaign soar to national prominence last summer. Clinton struggled to overcome major controversies over her use of a private email server during her four years heading the State Department and the tens of millions of dollars that she and her husband raked in giving speeches. Sanders, meanwhile, drew large crowds, raised huge sums of campaign funds and climbed in the polls with his unvarnished rhetoric that stirred young people and the Democratic liberal base.\n\nBut Clinton rode out the worst of the storm and now she is back to holding a commanding lead over Sanders and former Maryland governor Martin O\u2019Malley in the race for the Democratic nomination.\n\nRelated: Petraeus Warns: No U.S. Ground Troops in Syria\n\nA new Quinnipiac University poll released on Wednesday shows Clinton leading in Iowa among likely Democratic caucus goers with 51 percent to 42 percent for Sanders and three percent for O\u2019Malley. While Iowa Democrats give Sanders a slight edge over Clinton on the question of who would be a better steward of the economy, 73 percent say that Clinton would do the best job of overseeing foreign policy and combating terrorism, compared to just 23 percent for Sanders.\n\nAnd while Sanders can\u2019t be blamed for clinging to campaign themes that worked so well for him earlier, he is dangerously close to being written off as a Johnny One Note on the economy, one who lacks the experience or depth of knowledge of defense and foreign policy issues to qualify as the country\u2019s next commander in chief.\n\nPart of Sanders\u2019 problem at a time of mounting public fear and concern about terrorism is that he has traditionally opposed U.S. military intervention \u2013 as he did as a member of the House in voting against the Bush administration\u2019s decision to go to war against Iraq in October 2002. Clinton voted in favor of the Iraq war as a member of the Senate from New York, but she later said that she made a mistake.\n\nSanders has frequently reminded audiences that he made the far better decision in opposing a war that has led to many of the current problems in the Middle East, including the rise of ISIS. Yet Clinton is in a better position to argue that she would be a stronger president than Sanders in fighting terrorists in the Middle East and around the world.\n\nRelated: Wall Street Has Given Hillary Clinton $29 Million. What Does She Owe Them?\n\n\u201cHe is by nature a pacifist and someone for whom resorting to military action is something to be avoided at all cost,\u201d Ross Baker, a Rutgers University political professor, said in an interview on Wednesday. \u201cAnd I think he\u2019s being very principled in the sense that he doesn\u2019t want to depart radically from his core beliefs. And one of his core beliefs is that you resort to diplomacy and you don\u2019t wave a big stick.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, while Trump, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and other Republican presidential candidates continued to whip up the public against allowing Syrian refugees into the country for fear that terrorists might slip through, Sanders unveiled a detailed immigration plan that would protect 9 million illegal immigrants in this country from being deported. In contrast to the Republicans\u2019 often xenophobic, anti-immigrant rhetoric, Sanders promised a \u201chumane\u201d immigration system that would expand efforts to give the children of undocumented immigrants\u2019 legal status.\n\n\u201cI think he truly wants to be authentic,\u201d Baker said of Sanders. \u201cI think he\u2019s probably unique among all the candidates in his steadfastness to adhere to positions that he has taken traditionally. It\u2019s really quite interesting because, you know, there have been so many in-course corrections by some of these candidates recanting positions they\u2019ve taken before, like Gov. Chris Christie on gun control or Trump on any number of things. This is a guy who is a truly principled man \u2013 which is a serious handicap in this race.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "While the 2016 presidential campaign debate has shifted sharply to concerns about nati", "title": "Can Bernie Sanders Ignore National Security and Win?", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/11/25/Can-Bernie-Sanders-Ignore-National-Security-and-Win", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/11252015_Bernie_Sanders.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/11/25/Can-Bernie-Sanders-Ignore-National-Security-and-Win", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/11252015_Bernie_Sanders.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "While the 2016 presidential campaign debate has shifted sharply to concerns about nati", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe140d\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIt is absolutely imperative that foreign policy and how we most effectively destroy ISIS become part of the campaign,\u201d Sanders told John Wagner of The Washington Post.\n\u201cI think he\u2019s probably unique among all the candidates in his steadfastness to adhere to positions that he has taken traditionally.\nThis is a guy who is a truly principled man \u2013 which is a serious handicap in this race.\u201d\nSanders, meanwhile, drew large crowds, raised huge sums of campaign funds and climbed in the polls with his unvarnished rhetoric that stirred young people and the Democratic liberal base.\nI will continue talking about those issues as well.\u201dThere\u2019s no question that income inequality and the evils of Wall Street are topics that helped the 74-year-old Sander\u2019s once improbable campaign soar to national prominence last summer."}
