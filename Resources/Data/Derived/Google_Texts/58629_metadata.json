But that didn\u2019t happen.\u201d\n\nThe loss of faith in the nation\u2019s leadership incurred by the war continues today, he said. The perceived military setback convinced many that \u201cdefeat meant that we are not right. Lack of faith in being right means lack of faith in the future.\u201d\n\nHowever, Hasdai, who served as an investigator for the post-war Agranat Inquiry Commission that investigated the war\u2019s failures, no longer represents the majority sentiment in Israel. After decades of remorse at the war\u2019s heavy toll, Israelis have increasingly come to see the Yom Kippur War in a far different light.\n\n\u201cAn unprecedented victory is the true description of that war,\u201d writes Israel Harel, who also served as a paratrooper in 1973. \u201cBut in practice, a false, manipulative narrative has taken over the Israeli mind\u2014the fiasco narrative.\u201d\n\nThe trauma inflicted on the country in 1973 stemmed mainly from the military\u2019s failure to mobilize the reserves\u2014two-thirds of the army\u2019s strength\u2014in the week before the war as Egyptian and Syrian forces built up along the borders, outnumbering the Israeli forces opposite them by an 8-1 ratio or more.\n\nIsraeli defenses along the Suez Canal\u2014the so-called Bar-Lev Line\u2014fell in the first 24 hours and Syrian forces broke through Israeli lines and occupied the southern half of the Golan Heights. It would take several days before Israeli forces found their feet and began pushing back.\n\nHowever, the heavy losses of those opening days accounted for many of the 2,600 Israelis killed in the war, a figure incurred in just 19 days that is three times higher on a per capita basis than that suffered by the United States in the Vietnam War.\n\nThe intelligence failure, it was learned in later years, was the failure of one man: Gen. Eli Zeira, the head of military intelligence, who was convinced that the Arabs would not attack.\n\nZeira had at his disposal an intelligence tool referred to as \u201cspecial means\u201d which, it was believed, would have tipped off an Arab attack with near certainty. But activation of the system risked its premature discovery and since he was convinced the Arabs were not going to attack he was reluctant to flip the switch.\n\nFor most Israelis, memories of failure in the war\u2019s early going have faded while those surrounding the army\u2019s extraordinary reversal of fortune on the battlefield have grown in stature. When the war ended, Israel was within artillery range of Damascus, 60 miles from Cairo, and both Syria and Egypt were calling for a cease-fire.\n\n\u201cAfter 40 years of self-chastisement it is time to free ourselves of the shell shock that has been undermining our self confidence,\u201d Harel wrote in Ha\u2019aretz this week.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "JERUSALEM\u2014Forty years after the Yom Kippur War opinion is still divided in Israel over whether that conflict revealed imperfections in the national character or whether it was the greatest military", "title": "Israelis Look Back on Yom Kippur War Forty Years Later", "url": "http://freebeacon.com/issues/israelis-look-back-on-yom-kippur-war-forty-years-later/", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/YKW-150x150.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/YKW-150x150.jpg", "description": "JERUSALEM\u2014Forty years after the Yom Kippur War opinion is still divided in Israel over whether tha", "site": "@freebeacon", "card": "summary", "title": "Israelis Look Back on Yom Kippur War Forty Years Later"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1047859882", "fb": {"app_id": "FB_APP_ID"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe20d5\"", "article_summary": "After decades of remorse at the war\u2019s heavy toll, Israelis have increasingly come to see the Yom Kippur War in a far different light.\nIt would take several days before Israeli forces found their feet and began pushing back.\n\u201cThe Israeli people emerged from that war mentally beaten,\u201d he said in an interview with the newspaper Hayom Hazeh.\n\u201cAn unprecedented victory is the true description of that war,\u201d writes Israel Harel, who also served as a paratrooper in 1973.\nDr. Ya\u2019acov Hasdai, a lawyer and historian who served as a reserve paratroop officer in the war, inclines towards the former analysis."}
