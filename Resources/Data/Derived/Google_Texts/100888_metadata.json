Jason Oehlkers said the woman was possibly in her teens or early 20s, and that she is believed to be from Boulder.\n\n\"There is no foul play, nothing suspicious about it, at all,\" Oehlkers said.\n\nThe body was located in steep, rocky terrain at the base of a cliff estimated to be approximately 100 feet tall, according to a news release. When the body was discovered the conditions were deemed to be too unsafe for rescue personnel to remove her due to the heavy rain and thick fog at the time.\n\nTeams returned to the site today to complete the removal, which was expected to take about three hours.\n\n\"I do not believe that it is an climbing incident,\" Oehlkers said. \"It's either an accident or a suicide, but I can't say for sure. There is trauma.\"\n\nHe estimated the body had been in the location it was found for at least a couple of days.\n\nThe incident is currently being investigated by the sheriff's office and the Boulder County Coroner's Office.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Coroner's office will release the name of the woman, once identification has been verified and notification has been made to the next of kin. The Coroner's office will also make the final determination as to the cause and manner of the woman's death.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/boulder-county-news/ci_28175962/body-retrieval-underway-at-boulders-flagstaff-mountain", "sailthru.author": "By Charlie Brennan, Staff Writer", "ag": {"canon": "BoulderDailyCamera:article:28175962:view"}, "startDate": "2015-05-23T12:07:38-0600", "twitter": {"domain": "dailycamera.com", "description": "Rescue personnel from multiple agencies today are retrieving the body of an adult female which had been discovered Friday evening near the 2500 block of Flagstaff Road but could not be removed at night due to unsafe conditions.", "title": "Body retrieval underway at Boulder's Flagstaff Mountain", "url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/boulder-county-news/ci_28175962/body-retrieval-underway-at-boulders-flagstaff-mountain", "image": "http://local.dailycamera.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/dailycamera.png", "site": "@dailycamera", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "modificationDate": "2015-05-23T12:10:30-0600", "endDate": "2025-05-23T12:07:38-0600", "news_keywords": "Boulder County,Colorado,news,events,weather,breaking news,lifestyles,things to do,", "byline": "By Charlie Brennan,", "pubDate": "2015-05-23T12:12:38-0600", "sailthru.date": "2015-05-23T12:07:38-0600", "sailthru.title": "Body retrieval underway at Boulder's Flagstaff Mountain", "verify-v1": "TakAiHiDAOiNOP+m0YTx4DQeyjor+bTdc8e+pw6bDoI=", "sailthru.section": "Boulder County News", "description": "Rescue personnel from multiple agencies today are retrieving the body of an adult female which had been discovered Friday evening near the 2500 block of Flagstaff Road but could not be removed at night due to unsafe conditions.", "sailthru.site": "dailycamera.com", "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/boulder-county-news/ci_28175962/body-retrieval-underway-at-boulders-flagstaff-mountain", "image": "http://extras.dailycamera.com/images/dailycamera3.png", "type": "article", "description": "Rescue personnel from multiple agencies today are retrieving the body of an adult female which had been discovered Friday evening near the 2500 block of Flagstaff Road but could not be removed at night due to unsafe conditions.", "title": "Body retrieval underway at Boulder's Flagstaff Mountain"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "867892b0357001538903740c75a206f0"}, "google-site-verification": "07CC1xPDVU0znu496XTAjLyC32Ylj8zwWHlmrzx3pgY", "y_key": "c9d9b53f7f5af674"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1846\"", "article_summary": "The incident is currently being investigated by the sheriff's office and the Boulder County Coroner's Office.\nBoulder County Sheriff's Sgt.\nThe Coroner's office will also make the final determination as to the cause and manner of the woman's death.\nAdvertisementThe Coroner's office will release the name of the woman, once identification has been verified and notification has been made to the next of kin.\nHe estimated the body had been in the location it was found for at least a couple of days."}
