Then succeeded him as the first woman elected as Governor of Texas.\n\n/ Download\n\nMiriam Amanda Wallace wasn\u2019t considering a career in politics when she enrolled at Baylor Female College in the 1890s. In 1899, she married James Ferguson and planned to settle down and raise a family. However, Miriam would make history, becoming the first woman governor of Texas.\n\nJim Ferguson was elected governor in 1914, and re-elected two years later. During his second term, he was impeached for misapplication of public funds and declared ineligible to hold public office in Texas.\n\nA few years later, in 1924, Miriam stunned Texans when she announced she would run for Governor. Promising \u201ctwo governors for the price of one,\u201d Miriam became known as \u201cMa\u201d Ferguson and urged voters to restore \u201cPa\u2019s\u201d honor by voting for her.\n\nDuring the campaign, Jim vowed to do the governing if Miriam won. Many women were furious at Jim\u2019s plan to govern over his wife\u2019s shoulder, but the unusual plan worked. At the age of 49, \u201cMa\u201d Ferguson became Texas Governor.\n\nCharges of corruption plagued Miriam\u2019s first term, and she lost a re-election bid. Six years later, Miriam ran again, this time successfully, returning to the Governor\u2019s mansion for a second term.\n\nMiriam \u201cMa\u201d Ferguson retired from public office in 1935. Her political life was over but her place in Texas history was secure. 60 years would pass before Texas elected Ann Richards as its second woman Governor.\n\nSelected Bibliography\n\nFERGUSON, MIRIAM AMANDA WALLACE.
