Ted Cruz formally announced his presidential candidacy, the venue he chose \u2014 Jerry Falwell\u2019s Liberty University, the world\u2019s largest evangelical Christian school \u2014 was a clear signal that, for better or worse, religion again will be an active force in the upcoming general election.\n\nIn his address to one of the school\u2019s thrice weekly mandatory \u201cconvocations,\u201d Cruz checked all the religious right\u2019s obligatory boxes, professing his opposition to same-sex marriage, immigration reform, gun control, the Affordable Care Act and the Common Core educational standards. Along the way, he also endorsed replacement of the progressive income tax with a flat tax and the abolition of the Internal Revenue Service.\n\nLike other Republican hopefuls on the party\u2019s right wing, the Texas lawmaker, whose Cuban-born father is a fire-breathing fundamentalist preacher, understands that the religious right\u2019s support is virtually indispensable to a contemporary conservative candidacy. Meanwhile, a network of Protestant pastors and right-wing activists who cultivate so-called \u201cvalues voters\u201d already are trying to unite behind a single Republican candidate. To that end, they\u2019ve already held meetings in Iowa, Oklahoma and, last month, at a five-star resort in Dana Point. Something of the tenor of these gatherings can be gleaned by one woman\u2019s plea at the Iowa gathering that, instead of running against each other in the primaries, the \u201cgodly\u201d hopefuls should come together to pray and fast so that one of them might \u201crise up and receive an anointing.\u201d\n\nThe United States is the only country in the developed world in which this sort of faith-based babble is an unembarrassed part of national politics. Given that this is likely to remain true for the foreseeable future, it would be useful to arrive at a way to distinguish between those political interventions that reflect a religiously informed individual conscience and those that are simply an assertion of sectarian will.\n\nAs an example of that latter, let\u2019s consider the issue currently roiling California \u2014 an obscure Huntington Beach lawyer\u2019s demand that, having paid the requisite $200 fee, the state attorney general certify his proposition and allow him to gather signatures for a ballot measure he calls \u201cThe Sodomite Suppression Act.\u201d Apart from excluding gay and lesbian people from any public office or receipt of any public benefit, the measure\u2019s core proposal is \u201cthat any person who willingly touches another person of the same gender for purposes of sexual gratification be put to death by bullets to the head or by any other convenient method.\u201d If the proposition passes and state officials decline to enforce it, the measure empowers ordinary Californians to shoot gays and lesbians dead without legal or civil penalty.\n\nIn his introduction to his proposed measure, Matthew McLaughlin \u2014 who does not return phone calls and appears to operate his law practice from a postal box in a Beach Boulevard strip mall \u2014 explains his rationale for the initiative thusly: \u201cThe abominable crime against nature known as buggery, called also sodomy, is a monstrous evil that Almighty God, giver of freedom and liberty, commands us to suppress on pain of our utter destruction even as he overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah. Seeing that it is better that offenders should die rather than that all of us should be killed by God\u2019s just wrath against us for the folly of tolerating wickedness in our midst, the People of California wisely command, in the fear of God\u201d that gays and lesbians be shot dead.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPutting aside the long-standing, but increasingly clear and urgent need to reform California\u2019s absurdly out-of-control initiative process, Atty. Gen. Kamala Harris has asked a Sacramento court to relieve her of the obligation of certifying this initiative, but if the court declines her request, she\u2019ll have no choice but to allow McLaughlin to gather signatures to put this abomination on the ballot. I have to say that in half a century of covering this state\u2019s politics, \u201cunconstitutional\u201d doesn\u2019t begin to describe this measure. It is surely the single most repellent, vile and evil intervention into our politics to have occurred in my lifetime. And yet, its author claims to be inspired by God and acting on his behalf.\n\nNow, let\u2019s turn to political activism informed by a religiously based individual conscience. In his weekly column, Los Angeles\u2019 Roman Catholic Archbishop, Jose Gomez, argued that it\u2019s time for California and the rest of the United States to abolish capital punishment. Among the arguments the prelate marshalled were these: \u201cIn recent years, there have been highly publicized incidents where executions have been mishandled. In one instance, a convicted murderer spent more than 40 minutes in agony after receiving a lethal injection that was supposed to kill him within minutes. There is also substantial evidence that the death penalty is imposed far more often on racial minorities and the poor. And sadly, in some cases we have seen that, due to judicial error, some of those sent to death row did not actually commit the crimes they were convicted of.\u201d\n\nThe difference between McLaughlin\u2019s ghastly, indecent proposal and Gomez\u2019s sober analysis is crucial: Though both are faith-based, the former derives from an assertion of divine revelation and brooks no disagreement; the latter uses reasoned argument accessible to all to make its case, implicitly inviting those who differ to do the same.\n\nIn our politics, there must always be a place for conscience, but even faith-based propositions must meet the test of reason.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Prudent people never discuss politics or religion in a bar or as a guest at somebody else\u2019s dinner table.This week\u2019s events on the national and California political scenes provide object lessons in why that\u2019s so.When", "title": "Religion again will play an outsized role in the 2016 elections: Tim Rutten", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailynews.com/opinion/20150327/religion-again-will-play-an-outsized-role-in-the-2016-elections-tim-rutten", "image": {"width": "1500px", "identifier": "http://www.dailynews.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/LA/20150327/LOCAL1/150329482/AR/0/AR-150329482.jpg?Maxh=1500&Maxw=1500", "height": "1053px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Religion again will play an outsized role in the 2016 elections: Tim Rutten"}, "twitter": {"domain": "dailynews.com", "description": "Prudent people never discuss politics or religion in a bar or as a guest at somebody else\u2019s dinner table.This week\u2019s events on the national and California political scenes provide object lessons in why that\u2019s so.When", "title": "Religion again will play an outsized role in the 2016 elections: Tim Rutten", "url": "http://www.dailynews.com/opinion/20150327/religion-again-will-play-an-outsized-role-in-the-2016-elections-tim-rutten", "image": {"src": "http://www.dailynews.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/LA/20150327/LOCAL1/150329482/AR/0/AR-150329482.jpg?Maxh=900&Maxw=900"}, "site": "@ladailynews", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id551745144", "iphone": "id502957174", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.ladailynews"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "keywords": "Columns, Columns news, Los Angeles Columns news, CA Columns news, US Columns news, world Columns news.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Columns, Columns news, Los Angeles Columns news, CA Columns news, US Columns news, world Columns news."}, "article_summary": "This week\u2019s events on the national and California political scenes provide object lessons in why that\u2019s so.\nI have to say that in half a century of covering this state\u2019s politics, \u201cunconstitutional\u201d doesn\u2019t begin to describe this measure.\nPrudent people never discuss politics or religion in a bar or as a guest at somebody else\u2019s dinner table.\nIn our politics, there must always be a place for conscience, but even faith-based propositions must meet the test of reason.\nThere is also substantial evidence that the death penalty is imposed far more often on racial minorities and the poor."}
