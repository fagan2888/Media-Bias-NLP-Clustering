Boulder County sheriff’s deputies helped rescue a hiker who fell about 200 feet down an embankment at the Third Flatiron in Chautauqua Park after taking hallucinogenic drugs.

Deputies, rescuers from Rocky Mountain Rescue Group, Boulder Mountain Parks and Open Space rangers, Boulder firefighters and American Medical response helped rescue the hiker, who was identified as Austin Stevens. Stevens was taken to the hospital for treatment of his injuries, which were described as minor to moderate by Heidi Prentup, public information officer for the sheriff’s office.

About 3 p.m. Sunday, the sheriff’s office received a call that a man was acting strangely in the park. As the caller was talking with dispatch, the man fell, Prentup said.
