Or rather, he\u2019s moving actively in that direction. As he announced on Facebook this morning, over Thanksgiving he spent some time with his family, eating and watching football. \u201cWe also talked about the future of our nation. As a result of these conversations and thoughtful consideration of the kind of strong leadership I think America needs, I have decided to actively explore the possibility of running for President of the United States.\u201d\n\nRoll your eyes if you will about the prospect of yet another Bush presidency \u2014 as Jeet Heer pointed out this morning, \u201cthe last time the GOP won the White House without a Bush on the ticket was 1972. The last time without a Bush or Nixon: 1928.\u201d But Jeb\u2019s entry could actually have a profound effect on the 2016 Republican primaries, in healthy ways.\n\nBush will immediately be in the front rank of candidates, simply by virtue of his name and the support he has within elite Republican circles. That means that he\u2019ll get lots of press attention, and other candidates will inevitably engage him in policy arguments. And there will be arguments. The best way to understand the effect Bush will have on the primaries is to contrast him with Mitt Romney, another politician\u2019s son and establishment favorite.\n\nWhen Romney ran, in 2008 but especially in 2012, he dealt with his history of moderate stances by sprinting to the right, to assure base Republicans that he\u2019d be there for them. It was awkward and uncomfortable, and hurt him in the general election. (You may remember his comment about getting undocumented immigrants to \u201cself-deport.\u201d) In general, Romney\u2019s move to the right had the effect of narrowing the policy discussion within the primaries. He could, for instance, have made a detailed argument for the efficacy of the health reform he passed in Massachusetts. But since it was closely associated with the Affordable Care Act, he decided (probably correctly, as a short-term strategic matter) to join in the chorus of Obamacare condemnation. That was his approach to most issues \u2014 just say the same thing all the other GOP candidates said, as emphatically as possible. The result was a debate about who hated Barack Obama the most, which was not exactly enlightening.\n\nJeb Bush will be an enthusiastic participant in the 2016 version of that debate on many issues \u2014 don\u2019t fool yourself into thinking he isn\u2019t a conservative \u2014 but on a couple of key issues, it will be all but impossible for him to move to the right. One of those is Common Core education standards. Someone like Bobby Jindal can change their stance on it, now that conservatives have decided that the standards are some kind of Stalinist brainwashing scheme \u2014 Jindal was once a Common Core supporter, but now hates it with every fiber of his being. But Bush can\u2019t. The reason is that he isn\u2019t just a supporter of Common Core, he\u2019s probably its single more prominent advocate. He leads not one but two organizations (see here and here) devoted to promoting it.\n\nFar more importantly, there\u2019s immigration. Bush doesn\u2019t just support comprehensive immigration reform, he talks about the subject in a very different way from most other Republicans. In a speech earlier this year, he described undocumented immigrants this way: \u201cYes, they broke the law, but it\u2019s not a felony. It\u2019s an act of love, it\u2019s an act of commitment to your family.\u201d And there\u2019s no question that Bush feels this sincerely. He wrote a book on immigration reform (which his opponents\u2019 aides are no doubt scouring for quotes that can be used against him). His wife is an immigrant from Mexico. He speaks Spanish. His kids look Hispanic. He\u2019s not going to suddenly change his position on immigration.\n\nWhat this means is that by being one of the top-tier candidates in the race, Bush instantly changes the immigration debate in the primaries. It isn\u2019t that any of the other candidates are going to move to the left, but the discussion will not just be about who wants to build the highest border fence. There will be at least one person talking about immigrants in human terms.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how Bush approaches other issues on which his views are not as firmly held. For instance, for a variety of reasons, climate change could be a surprisingly prominent issue in the upcoming race. President Obama is already making some aggressive moves on climate \u2014 making an agreement with China to reduce emissions, having the EPA issue regulations limiting greenhouse gases \u2014 and when he does more, the GOP candidates will respond with predictable condemnations. As for Bush, he hasn\u2019t said a lot on climate \u2014 at least once he called himself a climate \u201cskeptic\u201d and has expressed doubt both about whether climate change is occurring and what contributions humans have made to it, but some believe he\u2019s pragmatic enough to actually take moves to combat it. Some Republican candidates are sure to plant themselves in the climate denial position; Bush could join them, or stake out a position more tethered to reality. Which he chooses will be revealing.\n\nJeb Bush faces some serious hurdles in winning the GOP nomination; a lot of primary voters are going to start by distrusting him, and it may not be possible to convince them otherwise. But his presence will make the race a little more complicated, and a little more interesting.", "article_metadata": {"description": "On issues like immigration, his presence means there will be an actual policy debate.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "On issues like immigration, his presence means there will be an actual policy debate.", "title": "Jeb Bush may run for president.
