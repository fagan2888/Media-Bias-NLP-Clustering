It won\u2019t boost our economy, and it won\u2019t enhance our security, either. Isolating or disparaging Muslims \u2013 suggesting they should be treated differently when it comes to entering this country \u2013 that\u2019s not just a betrayal of our values, that\u2019s not just a betrayal of who we are. It would alienate the very communities at home and abroad,\u2019 and he goes on. \u2026\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing that requires America to take in all these so-called refugees \u2013 all these people from other parts of the world.\n\n\u201cWe get to decide who comes here, or at least we\u2019re supposed to. And instead, the political ruling class in Washington D.C. has imposed its will, despite, time after time, the American people saying no. It\u2019s just common sense.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a bureaucracy that can\u2019t determine the good from the bad. And so, when you\u2019re overwhelmed with people coming into a country, and you can\u2019t keep up with the paperwork, and you can\u2019t know who they are, and you\u2019re bringing them in here from the Middle East \u2013 from Syria, from other parts of the Middle East \u2013 where there\u2019s a civil war going on, where there\u2019s terrorism spreading, and where the enemy has said they intend to secrete their terrorists within these groups of people.\n\n\u201cAnd then when you look at what\u2019s going on in Europe \u2013 Europe is overrun. Europe\u2019s been hit. Europe\u2019s culture is collapsing. Why would you do that to your own country, and then turn around and say, \u2018This isn\u2019t who we are\u2019?\n\n\u201cWhat isn\u2019t who we are? What the hell is he talking about? First he trashes his own country, and then he says this isn\u2019t who we are. Well, we\u2019re not a bunch of left-wing kooks living in sanctuary cities. We\u2019re not a bunch of left-wing kooks with tenure in law schools and undergraduate classes. We know what\u2019s right.\n\n\u201cAnd when\u2019s the last time Obama went to one of these events and spoke out in defense of Christians \u2013 Christians, who are being slaughtered in the Middle East by Muslims? When was the last time he did that? When\u2019s the last time he directed his justice department to protect Christians rather than attack them legally through Obamacare and other devices and pretexts? When\u2019s the last time? Never!\n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time he spoke out about Jews and what\u2019s being done to Jews by Palestinian terrorists? When\u2019s the last time he spoke out about Jews and the anti-Semitism being imported into this country, into our college and university campuses? Never! Never.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "CNS News", "description": "On his show Monday, nationally syndicated radio show host Mark Levin explained why the American people do not need to take in \"all these so-called refugees\" from the Middle East and elswhere.", "title": "Mark Levin: Nothing Requires America to Take in All These So-Called Refugees", "url": "http://cnsnews.com/commentary/alex-grubbs/mark-levin-nothing-requires-america-take-all-these-so-called-refugees", "image": "//cdn.cnsnews.com/mark_levin_-_facebook_ap_photo_48.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-05-18T11:59:04-04:00", "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_time": "2016-05-18T11:49:47-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-18T11:59:04-04:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "On his show Monday, nationally syndicated radio show host Mark Levin explained why the American people do not need to take in \"all these so-called refugees\" from the Middle East and elswhere.", "title": "Mark Levin: Nothing Requires America to Take in All These So-Called Refugees", "url": "http://cnsnews.com/commentary/alex-grubbs/mark-levin-nothing-requires-america-take-all-these-so-called-refugees", "image": {"src": "http://cdn.cnsnews.com/mark_levin_-_facebook_ap_photo_48.jpg"}, "site": "@cnsnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "description": "On his show Monday, nationally syndicated radio show host Mark Levin explained why the American people do not need to take in \"all these so-called refugees\" from the Middle East and elswhere.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThere\u2019s nothing that requires America to take in all these so-called refugees \u2013 all these people from other parts of the world,\u201d Levin said.\n\u2026\u201cThere\u2019s nothing that requires America to take in all these so-called refugees \u2013 all these people from other parts of the world.\nOn his show Monday, nationally syndicated radio show host Mark Levin explained why the American people do not need to take in \"all these so-called refugees\" from the Middle East and elsewhere.\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time he spoke out about Jews and what\u2019s being done to Jews by Palestinian terrorists?\nWhen\u2019s the last time he spoke out about Jews and the anti-Semitism being imported into this country, into our college and university campuses?"}
