The lifelong Californian speaks with the laid-back lilt of a surfer, so common in his native Los Angeles County.\n\nA surfer, though, he is not. In fact, Bera is a prominent Sacramento-area doctor, the only Indian-American in Congress and, this fall, fighting to keep his suburban 7th District seat in one of the nation\u2019s most competitive races.\n\nHis challenger is businessman and former Congressman Doug Ose, who\u2019s getting an assist from Karl Rove\u2019s political action committee. They\u2019re using Bera\u2019s medical background to tie him to the failures of Obamacare, which is unpopular in this suburban district, and playing up his ties to Nancy Pelosi and other Democratic Party leaders. The drag of an unpopular president isn\u2019t helping.\n\n\u201cLet them bring it,\u201d Bera said of the Republicans.\n\nHis Indian-American roots augured well for his campaign warchest. The second generation of Indian-Americans is a growing force in political fundraising.\n\n\u201cThis really is about how we\u2019re going to care for our seniors and make sure they have the Social Security and Medicare they need,\u201d Bera told volunteers, \u201cbut also how we make sure those programs are available \u2026 for our children and grandchildren.\u201d\n\nWhile it\u2019s far from clear whether the 49-year-old Bera will win another term, you shouldn\u2019t feel too bad for the guy. Young, charismatic and well-connected, he will certainly have other leadership opportunities, regardless.\n\nIf Bera doesn\u2019t hold his seat, \u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019ll then decide on some other path to serve the public,\u201d says California Assemblyman Richard Pan, a fellow Democrat and doctor whose district overlaps with Bera\u2019s. And if he does return to Congress, well, his unique background, powerhouse fundraising and close ties to Democratic leaders bode well for his profile in Washington.\n\nBera \u201chas quickly become a go-to member when it comes to getting things done in Congress,\u201d says Rep. Joe Crowley, a New York Democrat and senior party leader, whom Bera calls a mentor. They\u2019ve worked together on the Congressional Caucus on India and Indian Americans, among other initiatives.\n\nBefore entering politics, Bera was the dean of admissions for the medical school at the University of California, Davis. He says he saw being a public servant as an extension of his medical career. Bera himself is a product of the UC system, receiving both his bachelor\u2019s and medical degrees from UC Irvine in Orange County.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll often hear me talk about, on the stump, going to four years of undergrad, four years of med school \u2026 and graduating with less than $10,000 worth of student debt, which is pretty remarkable,\u201d Bera says. \u201cFor far too many of the next generation of kids, they\u2019re priced out of being able to reach their goals.\u201d\n\nBera and his wife moved to the Sacramento area in 1995. He practiced internal medicine; she pursued her own medical degree at UC Davis. By the time the Democrats approached him in 2009, he\u2019d racked up a good number of leadership opportunities: at the Mercy health care system first, and then as chief medical officer for Sacramento County, advising the county board of supervisors and helping manage the local public health system, and then at UC Davis\u2019 medical school.\n\nThe D.C. Democrats thought Bera\u2019s profile could win over voters in the inland Northern California district \u2014 a mix of young families, white- and blue-collar workers, seniors, and agricultural and tech interests that cleaves between Democrats and Republicans. As a doctor, Bera was an antidote to the professional politician so out of favor in recent years.\n\nAnd his Indian-American roots augured well for his campaign warchest, according to one party aide with knowledge of leaders\u2019 thinking in 2010. The second generation of Indian-Americans is a growing force in political fundraising, particularly for candidates from its own community.\n\nBera\u2019s medical background has proven a double-edged sword.\n\nSure enough, Bera proved a fundraising juggernaut, outraising the Republican incumbent, Dan Lungren, by almost $1 million. He still lost. But two years later, with President Barack Obama on the ticket, Bera rewarded his backers\u2019 instincts and narrowly won a rematch against Lungren, again outraising him significantly.\n\nBera\u2019s roots have led him to U.S.-Asia policy, where his engagement has gotten foreign diplomats\u2019 attention. It\u2019s a smart move for someone looking to carve out a niche: Asia policy is critical for the United States in the years ahead, but there\u2019s a dearth of congressional leadership on the issue.\n\nBera\u2019s medical background has proven a double-edged sword, though. Doctors and medical organizations are some of the biggest donors to his campaign. But Republicans have lashed the doctor to Democrats\u2019 controversial health care overhaul. \u201cCongressman Ami Bera is a loyal foot soldier when the President calls on him to oppose Republican efforts to repeal and replace Obamacare,\u201d Ose complained earlier this year.\n\nNow Rove\u2019s group, Crossroads GPS, is getting into the act, running television ads knocking Bera for voting against Republicans\u2019 Obamacare repeals. It\u2019s all part of a strategy to paint Bera as a big-spending liberal, out of step with his more moderate district.\n\nBut Bera insists he\u2019s a centrist. He\u2019s part of the Hill\u2019s \u201cProblem Solvers,\u201d a bipartisan coalition that\u2019s premised, Bera says, on \u201cthe simple concept of saying let\u2019s just meet on a regular basis, let\u2019s have breakfast and get to know one another.\u201d Centrism has a strategic element, of course: It\u2019s a necessary stance for a junior member in the minority party to get anything done at all. And given the dividedness of Bera\u2019s district, it\u2019s just good politics.\n\nThe Problem Solvers brought him together with, among others, Rep. Chris Gibson, an upstate New York Republican and retired army colonel. The congressmen began work on a bill to help unclog the Department of Veterans Affairs\u2019 notoriously backlogged medical claims system. They determined that one reason for the backlog is that the Department of Defense and the VA use different systems to store medical records.\n\nGibson\u2019s proposal, which Bera co-sponsored: \u201cBy 2017, the Department of Defense and the VA have to have the same medical records system that\u2019s housed on a secure server on the cloud,\u201d enabling records to move between organizations seamlessly. The bill was attached to a larger piece of defense legislation and passed into law last year.\n\n\u201cSo there are things that we can do if we work together, and I think that\u2019s been the rule in my office,\u201d Bera says.\n\nBera\u2019s proven that he can play the game. Now the question is whether he can stay in long enough to make it count.\n\nCover Image by Noel Neuburger", "article_metadata": {"description": "The onetime doctor could be among a new class of Democratic leaders in Congress, if he can just hang onto his job in November.", "author": "Emily Cadei", "og": {"site_name": "OZY", "description": "The onetime doctor could be among a new class of Democratic leaders in Congress, if he can just hang onto his job in November.", "title": "California's Ami Bera Doesn't Blend in on Capitol Hill, and That's OK", "url": "http://www.ozy.com/rising-stars/californias-ami-bera-doesnt-blend-in-on-capitol-hill-and-thats-ok/33752", "image": "http://pictures.ozy.com/pictures/1500xany/6/0/8/40608_1013_D_discourse.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://pictures.ozy.com/pictures/1120xany/6/0/8/40608_1013_D_discourse.jpg"}, "description": "The onetime doctor could be among a new class of Democratic leaders in Congress, if he can just hang onto his job in November.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "California's Ami Bera Doesn't Blend in on Capitol Hill, and That's OK"}, "fb": {"app_id": 155498561323567}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Ozy", "section": "Rising Stars"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2da1\"", "article_summary": "As a doctor, Bera was an antidote to the professional politician so out of favor in recent years.\nBera himself is a product of the UC system, receiving both his bachelor\u2019s and medical degrees from UC Irvine in Orange County.\nRallying volunteers at his campaign headquarters in Elk Grove, California, Congressman Amerish \u201cAmi\u201d Bera sounds like any other So Cal bro.\nBefore entering politics, Bera was the dean of admissions for the medical school at the University of California, Davis.\nThe congressmen began work on a bill to help unclog the Department of Veterans Affairs\u2019 notoriously backlogged medical claims system."}
