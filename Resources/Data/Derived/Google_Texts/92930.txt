Kentuckians for Strong Leadership, the potent super PAC that has bought millions of dollars in ads supporting the re-election of Republican U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell, raised $3 million during the quarter ending Sept. 30. And almost none of that money was contributed by Kentuckians.

The money came in very few - but very large - contributions from people and corporations from out of state, including a half million dollar donation from billionaire Robert C. McNair, founder, chairman and CEO of the Houston Texans.

Lawrence DeGeorge, an investor from Jupiter, Florida, gave a quarter million in the recent quarter. Combined with $250,000 he gave earlier, DeGeorge also has given a half million dollars so far to Kentuckians for Strong Leadership.

Christine Chao, a New York attorney (I believe she is a sister of McConnell's wife Elaine Chao) gave $400,000 to Kentuckians for Strong Leadership in September.

Contributors are limited by federal law to giving no more than $5,200 to the campaign of a candidate for federal office.

But since the U.S. Supreme Court's Citizens United decision in 2010, people and corporations can make contributions of unlimited amounts to outside super PACs which can run independent campaigns advocating the election of the candidates they support.

Since it was created by McConnell supporters in April of 2013, Kentuckians for Strong Leadership has raised $6.8 million. And, despite its name, records show that just 2.7 percent of that money ($182,000) has come from Kentuckians. The big money has come from Florida, Texas and New York.

Donor Data: Look up donations to McConnell, Grimes

The recent report also shows the KSL got $100,000 in donations in September from billionaire West Virginia coal operator Jim Justice and his family. Justice recently reached a deal with Kentucky regulators on cleaning up what state officials say is the largest number of surface mine reclamation violations in the past decade in Eastern Kentucky.

The only contribution to KSL from Kentucky during the quarter was $10,000 donated by Papa John's founder and CEO John Schnatter.
