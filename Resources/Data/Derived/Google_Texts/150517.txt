Sioux Falls, SD

At the Sioux Falls Area Humane Society, Sarah Valentine is looking to adopt a cat. And she's got a lot to choose from.

"There seems to be just a larger number than I expected to see," Valentine said.

In fact there are up to 200 cats -- mostly newborns -- at the shelter.

"That's a lot of kittens," Staff Member Malorie Adamson said.

With so many mouths to feed, it's difficult to keep up.

"We probably have about a week's supply of each of these, so this, this and this, will last us probably one more week," Adamson said.

The shelter relies heavily on public donations to fill the bowls with food, but right now the need is growing faster than they expected.

"We've just seen a lot of kittens come in," Adamson said. "It's kitten season and all of them come in at once and then you have them in foster homes, so we have to give food to fosters and the ones that are here, so we go through a lot of food."

Many of these kittens are too young for adoption, and they must stay at the shelter for a few more weeks. And if the Humane Society doesn't get the kitten donations they need, they'll be forced to dip into the small amount money set aside to pay for animal medical bills.

"I'm just hoping more people can because I'm not surprised by it," Valentine said. "They've got so many to take care of, just a huge number to take care of."

If you would like to donate, they are in need of Dry Purina Kitten Chow and any brand of canned cat food for the newborn litters.
