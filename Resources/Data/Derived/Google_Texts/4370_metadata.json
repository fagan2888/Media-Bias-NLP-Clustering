Both of us have often sung them on Sunday, but not always with sincerity. Yes, we long for God. But if you took a good, hard look at how we have spent our time through the years, you might think we long for other things a bit more \u2014 things like a clean house, time with friends and \u201cenough\u201d sleep.\n\nAs good as \u201cdigging into the Word\u201d sounds, sometimes it\u2019s hard ground to break through. When we discuss the reality of how we live, we have to confess that there are times when we truly think about how we really should read it and sincerely intend to study His word later. Perhaps you know what we mean. Have you ever found yourself moving toward a quiet time and then suddenly a thousand other things begin fighting for your attention? You remember that you need to respond to that email. You start making a grocery list. You get sleepy.\n\nEven after pushing through those initial distractions, you realize that you don\u2019t know where to start. After all, the Bible is a big book. So you flip pages for a while, hoping something will catch your attention and magically transform the way you view the world. Then you start thinking that your time in the Word would be more successful, that you could \u201cget more out of it\u201d if you used a devotional. So you end up reading what somebody else said about the Bible instead of reading it for yourself.\n\nHave you ever lived out that kind of lukewarm Christianity? Or maybe the more important question is, have you ever experienced the opposite?\n\nHave you ever rushed home so you could throw the Bible open? Have you ever read it for so long, been so absorbed in its pages that you have forgotten to eat? That you have put off sleep? Have you let other books grow dusty on the shelves as you wore your way through the binding of your marked-up, tattered-up Bible?\n\nMatthew 4:4 says: \u201cPeople do not live by bread alone; rather, we live by every word that comes from the mouth of the Lord.\u201d\n\nThe words of Scripture and Jesus himself are often referred to as \u201cdaily bread\u201d and \u201cliving water.\u201d They are entirely necessary for life. It is even more important to satisfy our spiritual hunger and thirst than it is to eat and drink.\n\nIn the book of Haggai, God makes a simple observation about His people: \u201cThe people procrastinate\u201d (Haggai 1:2, MSG).\n\nHe is waiting for them to rebuild His temple, but they keep putting it off. Sound familiar? He is waiting for us to read and study His book, but we keep getting distracted.\n\nThe hope: The Word\n\nWhat He says next is just as much for us as it was for those Jewish people thousands of years ago.\n\n\u201cTake a good, hard look at your life.\n\nThink it over.\n\nYou have spent a lot of money,\n\nBut you haven\u2019t much to show for it.\n\nYou keep filling your plates,\n\nBut you never get filled up.\n\nYou keep drinking and drinking and drinking,\n\nBut you\u2019re always thirsty.\n\nHere\u2019s what I want you to do:\n\nClimb into the hills and cut some timber.\n\nBring it down and rebuild the temple.\n\nDo it just for me. Honor me.\n\nYou\u2019ve had great ambitions for yourselves,\n\nBut nothing has come of it\u201d (Haggai 1:5-9, MSG).\n\nEssentially, God is saying,\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re spending your life pursuing all these things that won\u2019t last. You forget that I am eternal. You love all the gifts I\u2019ve given you in life, but you ignore the One who gave them to you. This isn\u2019t working. Here\u2019s what I want you to do: Quit delaying and get to work. Get your priorities in order \u2014 our relationship should come first.\u201d\n\nBecause God\u2019s Word is entirely essential to growing in faith, it is the enemy\u2019s No. 1 task to distract us from reading it. Knowing God\u2019s Word is to know the One who conquered death and offers each of us the fulfilling love and oneness with him that we crave. \u201cGod\u2019s Word became flesh.\u201d It is the one true hope for every generation.\n\nSatan keeps us in bondage \u2014 to things, to schedules, to stress, to ourselves \u2014 when we do not spend time in the Word, in the truth. But it is the truth that sets us free. The Word of God is both our challenge, and our hope.\n\nThe Bible is more than a book for you to read. You are in the story. It\u2019s about your past \u2014 all of your hurts and fears and mistakes and broken dreams (no matter who you are) \u2014 and it\u2019s about your future \u2014 God wants to turn everything in your life into an eternal blessing.\n\nIt\u2019s tempting to think that you must have some kind of professional help in order to grow from reading the Bible, especially if you\u2019ve been around church for a long time and feel like you\u2019ve heard it all, but it isn\u2019t true. You can open the Bible right now, and if you are attentive to it, if you\u2019re patient and willing to let it teach you, you will learn something. Yes, there is \u201cwisdom in the multitude of counselors.\u201d But God\u2019s Word is also the story of how He speaks to all who are willing to listen.\n\nLearning to read your Bible regularly \u2014 not just read it, but soak in it, chew on it and digest it \u2014 requires discipline. It takes practice, but when you get used to it, you begin to desire that time. You begin to hunger for the Word.\n\nAnn Voskamp wrote, \u201cDaily discipline is the door to full freedom.\u201d If you exert yourself in an effort to know God, if you make your relationship with Him into a two-way street and feed that relationship above everything else, then God will respond in a magnificent way.\n\n\u201cThis Temple is going to end up far better than it started out, a glorious beginning but an even more glorious finish: a place in which I will hand out wholeness and holiness\u201d (Haggai 2:9, MSG).\n\nNo matter where you are in your faith, there is room to grow, and if you dive deeper into Scripture, you will.\n\nThis is our prayer:\n\n\u201cOpen my eyes to see wonderful things in your Word. I am but a pilgrim here on earth: how I need a map \u2014 and your commands are my chart and guide. I long for your instructions more than I can tell\u201d (Psalm 119:18-20, TLB).", "article_metadata": {"description": "Yes, we long for God.
