Alzheimer\u2019s, perhaps the worst type of dementia, is a progressive disease that works slowly, first making it difficult to remember newly learned things, and later on making it difficult to remember early memories and family member\u2019s faces, while also causing hallucinations.\n\nThe biggest risk factor for the disease is being over 65 years old; an age that many baby boomers, who comprise 26 percent of the American population, began reaching in 2012. Over 10,000 baby boomers will turn 65 each day for the next 17 years, and with the cause, prevention, and treatment of Alzheimer\u2019s being such a mystery, scientists are frantically trying to understand it. Thus, we have coffee, a potential method for preventing it.\n\n\u201cThe findings presented in this report are very encouraging and help to develop our understanding of the role nutrition can play in protecting against Alzheimer\u2019s disease,\u201d said Dr. Iva Holmerova, vice chairperson of Alzheimer Europe, in a press release. \u201cCoffee is a very popular beverage enjoyed by millions of people around the world, and I\u2019m pleased to know that moderate, lifelong consumption can have a beneficial effect.\u201d\n\nRoughly 83 percent of American adults drink coffee, according to the National Coffee Association. What many of these Americans don\u2019t know, however, is that inside that cup of Joe is a wealth of polyphenols, which you probably know as antioxidants. These antioxidants \u2014 researchers said they\u2019re the same ones found in the Mediterranean diet \u2014 prevent the formation of a hallmark of Alzheimer\u2019s disease known as amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, the study found. They also reduce inflammation and deterioration of brain cells, particularly in the areas of the brain (the hippocampus and cortex) responsible for memory.\n\nAlong with prevention of Alzheimer\u2019s, coffee has been linked to a reduced risk of liver cancer and other liver conditions, a lower risk of type 2 diabetes; it prevents eye damage and Parkinson\u2019s disease; and even boosts endurance. But even then, drinking too much isn\u2019t good, either. As the researchers noted, three to five cups is optimal; anything over that, and you might find yourself with some problems.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "drinking, coffee, can, lower, alzheimers, risk, 20, all, it, takes, 3, cups, day", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Drinking between three and five cups of coffee a day can reduce a person's Alzheimer's risk by 20 percent.", "title": "3 Cups Of Coffee A Day, Keeps Alzheimer's Away", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/drinking-coffee-can-lower-alzheimers-risk-20-all-it-takes-3-cups-day-312410", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/11/26/coffee-may-reduce-alzheimers-risk.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Drinking between three and five cups of coffee a day can reduce a person's Alzheimer's risk by 20 percent.", "title": "3 Cups Of Coffee A Day, Keeps Alzheimer's Away", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/drinking-coffee-can-lower-alzheimers-risk-20-all-it-takes-3-cups-day-312410", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/11/26/coffee-may-reduce-alzheimers-risk.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/11/26/coffee-may-reduce-alzheimers-risk.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Vitality", "published_time": "2014-11-26T19:00:00-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-26T19:04:03-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Drinking between three and five cups of coffee a day can reduce a person's Alzheimer's risk by 20 percent."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd243e\"", "article_summary": "As if you weren\u2019t already drinking a lot of coffee, a review of several studies has found drinking three to five cups a day could reduce risk of Alzheimer\u2019s disease by 20 percent.\nAlong with prevention of Alzheimer\u2019s, coffee has been linked to a reduced risk of liver cancer and other liver conditions, a lower risk of type 2 diabetes; it prevents eye damage and Parkinson\u2019s disease; and even boosts endurance.\nAs the researchers noted, three to five cups is optimal; anything over that, and you might find yourself with some problems.\nThese antioxidants \u2014 researchers said they\u2019re the same ones found in the Mediterranean diet \u2014 prevent the formation of a hallmark of Alzheimer\u2019s disease known as amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, the study found.\n\u201cThe findings presented in this report are very encouraging and help to develop our understanding of the role nutrition can play in protecting against Alzheimer\u2019s disease,\u201d said Dr. Iva Holmerova, vice chairperson of Alzheimer Europe, in a press release."}
