Specifically, the feds mentioned bowel preparation medications given before the colonoscopy.\n\nHowever, when utilizing reasonable medical management techniques, plans can create a standard exception form \u2013 which can be modeled after the Medicare Part D Coverage Determination Request Form \u2013 so providers can prescribe specific services or FDA-approved items.\n\nOut-of-network ER services\n\nWhen asked, plans generally must disclose how the payments for out-of-network ER services were calculated to comply with ERISA\u2019s disclosure rules and the ACA\u2019s appeals process and external review requirements.\n\nClinical trials and cancer\n\nThe FAQs tackled how cancer treatment coverage applies to clinical trials. Specifically, if a plan covers chemotherapy, it generally can\u2019t limit that coverage when it\u2019s connected with an individual\u2019s participation in an approved clinical trial for a new anti-nausea medication.\n\nPlus, plans can\u2019t deny coverage of items or services to diagnose or treat side effects that are part of a clinical trial if the plan generally covers those things for non-clinical trial treatment.\n\nMental health parity\n\nThe feds dedicated three questions to clarifying some issues surrounding the Mental Health Parity Act, specifically how to perform certain tests \u2014 \u201csubstantially all\u201d and \u201cpredominant\u201d \u2014 for financial requirements and quantitative limits.\n\nThose testing requirements apply to any benefits a plan offers for medication-assisted treatment of an opioid use disorder.\n\nReconstructive surgery following a mastectomy\n\nFinally, the feds clarified that under the WHCRA, plans must provide coverage for nipple and areola reconstruction \u2014 including repigmentation to restore the physical appearance of the breast \u2014 as a required stage of breast reconstruction.\n\nA version of this article was published previously on our sister website, CFO Daily News.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"description": "New\u00a0Obamacare guidance from the agencies responsible for implementing\u00a0the ACA includes a lot of important info on health plans and cost-sharing.", "title": "DOL answers more questions on ACA: 5 highlights", "url": "http://www.hrmorning.com/dols-answers-more-questions-on-aca-5-highlights/", "image": {"width": 507, "identifier": "http://www.hrmorning.com/wp-content/uploads/462919173.jpg", "height": 338}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.hrmorning.com/wp-content/uploads/462919173.jpg?w=640", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "keywords": "aca, dol, obamacare, FAQ, healthcare reform", "article": {"published_time": "2016-05-06T18:29:05+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-06T19:38:30+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The feds\u2019 (DOL, HHS and IRS) 31st FAQ on healthcare reform answers a lot of important questions for employers about the ACA.\nNew Obamacare guidance from the agencies responsible for implementing the ACA includes a lot of important info on health plans and cost-sharing.\nSome of the highlights employers should know from the 12-question FAQ:Preventive servicesThe first few questions in the FAQ deal with the preparation for a common preventive procedure: a colonoscopy.\nAccording to the feds, the preparation is an integral part of the actual procedure and, generally, must be covered without any cost-sharing.\nBut it also delves into other federal laws such as the Mental Health Parity Act and the Women\u2019s Health and Cancer Rights Act (WHCRA)."}
