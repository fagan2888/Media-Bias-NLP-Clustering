To the Editor:

Re “California Proves That Health Reform Works” (editorial, Aug. 10):

You are right that California is setting the pace with our implementation of Obamacare. And we are leading the way, in large part, because civic and grass-roots leaders in our state were committed to an aggressive approach to enrollment.

We think that Obamacare could be even more successful with one important reform.

More than a million and a half undocumented Californians don’t have access to Obamacare because they and all undocumented Americans are barred from participating. Anyone who believes that their exclusion from the law saves dollars is mistaken.

Undocumented Californians contribute tens of billions of dollars to our state’s economy, and their lack of insurance coverage results in lost productivity and increased reliance on emergency rooms and other government health services. And perhaps more important, their exclusion undermines the principle of health care as a human right.

We are proud of our state’s success story with Obamacare. We will be even prouder when all Californians are part of that story.
