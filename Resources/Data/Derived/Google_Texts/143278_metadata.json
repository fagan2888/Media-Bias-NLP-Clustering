The plan wouldn\u2019t cover hospitalization, prescription medications or specialty procedures.\n\n\u201cTo add to this, Ottercare comes at triple the price,\u201d Erpelding said. He pointed out Idahoans pay federal taxes for Medicaid expansion, but don\u2019t receive the benefits, while also funding the state\u2019s catastrophic health care program to the tune of more than $40 million annually. The new healthcare program, he said, would complete the trifecta of wasteful spending.\n\nDemocrats plan to introduce a Medicaid expansion bill this year, but Erpelding declined to say when his party would bring it to the Capitol.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to get into timelines,\u201d Erpelding said.\n\nSome 33 states have expanded Medicaid, at least four more are discussing the idea.\n\nDemocratic leadership also suggested lawmakers raise the minimum wage. Erpelding successfully introduced a bill to do that last year, but it did not receive a full hearing.\n\n\u201cWe do have a similar bill to last year,\u201d Erpelding.\n\nThe 2015 bill, which Senate State Affairs Chairman Curt McKenzie, R-Nampa, refused to hear, would have raised the state\u2019s minimum wage to $9.25 an hour over a two-year period.\n\nDespite last year\u2019s rejection, minority leader Erpelding pledged to keep the wage increase on the to-do list.\n\n\u201cWe have not changed any of our approach in terms of how we\u2019re advancing our idea of the minimum wage,\u201d he said.\n\nErpelding added, \u201cThe idea is to raise the minimum wage to a point where an Idahoan can get off government services.\u201d\n\nAmong their other policy ideas, Democrats also want to create an inspector general\u2019s office, to ensure good governance, and sunset tax exemptions, to ensure their effectiveness.\n\nDemocrats tried and failed to create the inspector general post last year.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "IdahoReporter.com", "description": "Not content with the proposed $116 million in proposed new money for Idaho\u2019s public schools, legislative Democrats suggested Monday they would like to add another $30 million in education spending.
