Rob Portman (R-Ohio), said as he opened a hearing Thursday to review the problems.\n\nThe Consumer Oriented and Operated Plan program was a part of the health-care law intended to foster a new breed of coverage that would serve as an alternative to traditional insurers. Proponents said the co-ops never had a fair chance to compete, with funding for them cut up front. That blow was followed by federal health officials\u2019 decision last fall to pay just 12.5 percent of what the plans and other insurers were owed under a different part of the law designed to balance the risk of covering healthy patients vs. sick ones.\n\n[More than half of ACA co-ops now out of insurance marketplaces]\n\nThe new report says the Department of Health and Human Services was told early by its outside financial consultant that the 12 co-ops\u2019 business plans and financial forecasts were inadequate, incomplete or based on unsupported assumptions \u2014 and yet officials approved loans anyway.\n\nAfter that, the report says, HHS failed to monitor the co-ops\u2019 status despite being aware of their \u201csevere financial distress,\u201d continued to disburse loans and allowed them to list anticipated payments through the ACA risk-balancing program as assets even after getting \u201ccredible warnings that those payments would not materialize.\u201d\n\nThe report says federal officials were negligent in their oversight in several ways. Not only were the failed plans\u2019 financial losses beyond \u201ceven the worst-case loss projections\u201d they\u2019d included in their loan applications to HHS, but their enrollment numbers were similarly off base.\n\n\u201cHHS was aware of these problems in early 2014, but took no correction action,\u201d the report charges. Moreover, some loan disbursements were accelerated and additional amounts approved for several plans.\n\nIn all, for every $1 that HHS sent the 12 failed plans in 2014-2015, they lost about $1.65, according to the report. \u201cNone of the failed CO-OPs have repaid a single dollar, principal or interest, of the $1.2 billion in federal solvency and start-up loans they received,\u201d it says. \u201cOur investigation suggests no significant share of those loans ever will be repaid based on the latest balance sheets we obtained.\u201d\n\nSome hospitals and doctors may never get the reimbursement they are owed, the report concludes. In New York state, for example, the now-shuttered Health Republic Insurance of New York had $380 million in unpaid claims at the end of 2015 and just $158 million in assets.\n\nIn his prepared remarks to the committee, the acting director of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), which oversees the co-ops, said their challenges should be viewed as \u201ca small-business start-up problem,\u201d not as a problem inherent to the program itself.\n\nTrial and error is always part of the process, Andy Slavitt said. \u201cIn this situation, with the limited capital available and competing against giants, the co-ops have had very little room for error.\u201d\n\nSlavitt defended the HHS oversight process, as did Kevin Counihan, director of HHS\u2019s Center for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight. Counihan said CMS is reviewing the latest financial and enrollment figures for the remaining 11 co-ops. \u201cPlan year 2016 is a critical year,\u201d he said in his prepared testimony. \u201cThey must move from start-up to stability and improve their financial capabilities.\u201d\n\nCounihan also said CMS is working with officials at the Justice Department to recover the federal loan money.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "health, Affordable Care Act, co-ops, insurance, CMS, HHS, Congress", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Senate scrutiny of the 12 failed plans faults HHS with a lack of program vigilance and oversight.", "title": "$1.2 billion in loans to ACA health insurance co-ops may be a loss, report warns", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/12-billion-in-loans-to-aca-health-insurance-co-ops-may-be-a-loss-report-warns/2016/03/10/733744be-e6f7-11e5-bc08-3e03a5b41910_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2016/02/09/Health-Environment-Science/Images/Health_Insurance-0d2f0-832.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@goldsteinamy"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/12-billion-in-loans-to-aca-health-insurance-co-ops-may-be-a-loss-report-warns/2016/03/10/733744be-e6f7-11e5-bc08-3e03a5b41910_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "health, Affordable Care Act, co-ops, insurance, CMS, HHS, Congress", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "eomportal-uuid": "733744be-e6f7-11e5-bc08-3e03a5b41910", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "description": "Senate scrutiny of the 12 failed plans faults HHS with a lack of program vigilance and oversight."}, "article_summary": "In all, for every $1 that HHS sent the 12 failed plans in 2014-2015, they lost about $1.65, according to the report.\n\u201cThese failed CO-OPs were a costly experiment gone wrong, and real people got hurt \u2014 including the more than 700,000 Americans who lost their health plans,\u201d the panel\u2019s chairman, Sen.\nNot only were the failed plans\u2019 financial losses beyond \u201ceven the worst-case loss projections\u201d they\u2019d included in their loan applications to HHS, but their enrollment numbers were similarly off base.\n\u201cNone of the failed CO-OPs have repaid a single dollar, principal or interest, of the $1.2 billion in federal solvency and start-up loans they received,\u201d it says.\nCounihan said CMS is reviewing the latest financial and enrollment figures for the remaining 11 co-ops."}
