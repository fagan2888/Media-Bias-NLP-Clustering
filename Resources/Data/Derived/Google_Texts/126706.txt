A standoff stretching eight-and-a-half hours ended in Russell early Monday, with a suspect in custody.

Russell County Sheriff John Fletcher says officers were in the area of 7th and Ober from 5:00 p.m. Sunday to 1:30 a.m. Monday. A statement from Fletcher reports Clayton Becker barricaded himself in a home, threatening either a shootout with officers or suicide.

Fletcher's statement says state agents found Becker hiding under basement stairs at the home, and was arrested "after a brief struggle." The sheriff says Becker was wanted on several felony charges.
