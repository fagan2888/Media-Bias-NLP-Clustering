Nash Central High School defensive lineman Houshun Gaines made a verbal commitment to Virginia Tech on Saturday evening.

Gaines stands at 6-foot-4 and 220 pounds and is rated a three-star prospect by 247Sports.com.

Before committing to Virginia Tech, Gaines considered offers from Boston College, Duke, Florida, Miami, NC State, Wake Forest, Vanderbilt and Virginia.

Earlier this fall, Gaines fell victim to a catfish scam in which someone claimed to be an assistant coach from Florida. When Gaines announced a previous verbal commitment to Florida, the Gators' coaching staff claimed not to know anything about it and declined to accept his commitment.

Florida did actively recruit Gaines, though. Members of the coaching staff offered him a scholarship while on a visit to Nash Central High School.

Gaines was also a winner of Tom Suiter's Extra Effort Award this fall.

On Saturday, Gaines represented North Carolina in the Shrine Bowl of the Carolinas, an all-star game that features top seniors from North Carolina against their counterparts in South Carolina.
