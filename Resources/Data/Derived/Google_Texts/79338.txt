18 Hospitals That Closed in 2013

The healthcare sector is entering into one of its most important years in decades, but many hospitals have been left behind.

Throughout 2013, 18 acute-care hospitals closed their doors, and there are many others — such as Interfaith Medical Center in Brooklyn, N.Y., Vidant Pungo Hospital in Belhaven, N.C., Lake Shore Health Care Center in Irving, N.Y., and Williamson (W.Va.) Memorial Hospital, to name a few — that could follow suit this year.

Here are 18 hospitals that closed in 2013, beginning with the most recent. Note: The following list only includes acute-care hospitals that have completely shut down, not those that have closed individual services, units or departments.

• Florala (Ala.) Memorial Hospital, a 28-bed, privately owned hospital, closed in late December without advanced notice to the city.

• Lee Regional Medical Center, a 70-bed hospital in Pennington Gap, Va., closed Oct. 1, partly due to Medicare reimbursement cuts under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.

• Corcoran (Calif.) District Hospital, one of the last rural hospitals in the central San Joaquin Valley, ended its run as an acute-care provider this past fall, though its rural clinic remained open through Roseville, Calif.-based Adventist Health.

• Christus Health Shreveport-Bossier in Shreveport, La., closed the emergency department and inpatient and outpatient services at Christus Schumpert Medical Center, also in Shreveport.

• In August, Cozby-Germany Hospital, a 52-bed hospital in Grand Saline, Texas, closed its doors.

• Los Angeles-based Pacific Health Corp. closed all four of its hospitals in California — Anaheim General Hospital, Bellflower Medical Center, Los Angeles Metropolitan Medical Center (and its Hawthorne campus) and Newport Specialty Hospital — after the for-profit chain ran into millions of dollars of legal fines and lawsuits.
