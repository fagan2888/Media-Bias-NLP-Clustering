He is, by far, the most cited legal scholar alive today (probably ever). Nominated by Ronald Reagan, he sits on the United States Court of Appeals, just below the Supreme Court. He has publicly feuded with Justice Antonin Scalia over how judges actually decide, and should decide, cases. And, over the last year, he has spoken truth to power in three high-profile cases all likely to be decided by the Supreme Court.\n\nOn issues of abortion, same-sex marriage and religious objections to Obamacare, Posner said exactly what needed to be said with honest, unequivocal and, to some perhaps, startling clarity.\n\nThe University of Notre Dame didn\u2019t want to provide certain forms of required contraception to its students and employees so it went to court seeking a religious exemption. The bizarre thing about the case is Notre Dame was already exempt. What it wanted was not to fill out the form that would have guaranteed the university an exemption. Notre Dame claimed, to most people\u2019s disbelief, that filling out the short form and asking for the exemption was itself a substantial burden on its religious exercise.\n\nPosner would have none of it. At the oral argument, he took a harsh tone with the lawyer for Notre Dame who refused again and again to answer directly how filling out a piece of paper could possibly be a \u201csubstantial burden on religion.\u201d Becoming more and more frustrated, Posner eventually asked the lawyer to \u201cstop babbling,\u201d and \u201cstop fencing,\u201d eventually warning him that \u201cif you don\u2019t cooperate with me, I\u2019m not going to let you continue your argument.\u201d The judge\u2019s frustration stemmed from his perception that Notre Dame\u2019s claims had no merit, and the lawyer was simply bobbing and weaving.\n\nEventually, Notre Dame lost (the court of appeals uses three-judge panels) and the final opinion written by Posner said this: \u201cThe novelty of Notre Dame\u2019s claim\u2013not for the exemption, which it has, but for the right to have it without having to ask for it\u2013deserves emphasis \u2026 What makes this case and others like it involving the contraception exemption paradoxical and virtually unprecedented is that the beneficiaries of the religious exemption are claiming that the exemption process itself imposes a substantial burden on their religious faiths \u2026 The process of claiming one\u2019s exemption \u2026 is the opposite of cumbersome. It amounts to signing one\u2019s name and mailing the signed form to two addresses.\u201d\n\nFrom the oral argument through the decision, Posner seemed shocked at the idea that Notre Dame would challenge an exemption given to it by the federal government on the basis that it, gasp, had to ask for it. He couldn\u2019t be more right.\n\nA few months later, Posner, again along with two other judges, reviewed the validity of a brand-new Wisconsin law requiring doctors who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals. The law, if valid, would make it much more difficult for clinics in Wisconsin to provide abortion services because, of the four clinics in the entire state that perform abortions, two would have been shut down. Although the case came to the court on a preliminary motion (an emergency stay had been granted by the lower court), Posner took the opportunity to demonstrate why he thought the plaintiffs would eventually prevail.\n\nIn affirming the stay, Posner noted that \u201cno documentation of medical need for such an admitting privileges requirement was presented to the Wisconsin legislature when the bill that became the law was introduced.\u201d He also noted that no \u201cother procedure performed outside a hospital, even one as invasive as a surgical abortion (such as a colonoscopy) \u2026 and even if performed when the patient is under general anesthesia \u2026 is required by Wisconsin law to be performed by doctors who have admitting privileges at hospitals within a specified, or indeed any, radius of the clinic at which the procedure is performed.\u201d Posner added that the risks of colonoscopies are three to six times greater than the risks of abortions (yet doctors can perform them in outpatient centers without having admitting privileges), and that, based on a report by the state, out of 1,192 abortions that were reported, there were only 16 complications, a rate of less than 1 percent.", "article_metadata": {"description": "On three high-profile cases bound for the Supreme Court, Judge Richard Posner has seen through right-wing blather", "author": "Eric J.
