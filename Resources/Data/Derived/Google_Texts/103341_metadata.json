Fry cooks throughout the nation took to the streets to lament their dreadful lot in life. Liberal wonks have taken to the airwaves to complain about how one just can\u2019t live on $7.25 an hour, and it should be raise. Some of these wonks say it should be doubled even.\n\nOh, cry me a freaking river.\n\nBefore I get into specifics, let me point out that as an entrepreneur, if I took how much I made running two businesses and divided it by the number of hours I work, I\u2019d probably make less than $1 per hour, so don\u2019t try to counter this as being \u201cthe rich looking down on the poor.\u201d I can barely pay my bills, so I hardly count as rich. Also, for the record, only one of these businesses is mine, so don\u2019t pull the \u201cyou own two businesses, so clearly you\u2019re well off\u201d crap. My wife makes more than minimum wage, but not by a whole lot. We have two kids. We are scraping by, and just barely.\n\nNow, about the minimum wage. There are some things the wonks are right about. One can not live on a minimum wage income \u2014 $7.25 per hour just isn\u2019t enough to pay rent, a car payment, insurance on said car, utilities, and some kind of phone.\n\nOf course, it\u2019s also not meant to do that.\n\nMinimum wage jobs aren\u2019t skilled labor. They\u2019re entry level jobs. That means they\u2019re for people entering the workforce. They\u2019re for high school and college kids. They\u2019re for people who have left high school and are trying to figure out what they want to be when they grow up. They\u2019re for the young person trying to get established. Hence the term \u201centry level.\u201d\n\nThese are not career opportunities. It can happen. Sure, the Burger King fry cook can be named assistant manager, then manager, and work his way up the corporate ladder. It\u2019s awesome when it happens, but that\u2019s not the design.\n\nInstead, these jobs are there to provide a service to the customer while presenting the entry level worker with an understanding of what it\u2019s like to work. These are the jobs where you learn the importance of treating a customer well, of showing up on time, of working hard, etc.\n\nThey\u2019re not jobs for people who\u2019ve just been too damn lazy to try and expand their prospects over the previous five to ten years. If that\u2019s what someone does, that\u2019s on them.\n\n\u201cNot everyone wants to be a corporate CEO,\u201d some might say. I can understand that. Running a business isn\u2019t for everyone, but so what? There are a million different things someone can do if they want a better life. A job at a fast food joint just isn\u2019t one of them, and it never will be. Join the military, go to tech school, find a job that pays more, any of these are viable alternatives to the minimum wage job.\n\nWhat all of this really boils down to isn\u2019t fairness, despite what the left is trying to say. What it really boils down to is that some people have no practical ambitions in life \u2014 meaning I automatically discount the guy who couldn\u2019t get a basketball scholarship to college but wants to play in the NBA - but expects to live like those who have worked their butts off to get somewhere in life.\n\nI\u2019m sick of \u201cfair\u201d being defined by the destination, and not by the journey necessary to get there. However, that\u2019s what these cry babies holding up signs about how they don\u2019t make enough at their job flipping burgers are really wanting. They want equality of outcome, not equality of opportunity.\n\nThe opportunities are already there. They just have to make use of them and make it happen.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "entry level,equality,fairness,fry cook,income equality,jobs,livable wage,minimum wage,restaurants,salary,skilled labor,teens,Wages,Workers,young workers,Politics,News,Blog,Current,Alternative,Libertarian,Freedom,Election,Nonpartisan,Ron Paul", "description": "I&#8217;ve heard a lot recently about the minimum wage.\u00a0 Fry cooks throughout the nation took to the streets to lament their dreadful lot in life.\u00a0 Liberal wonks have taken to the airwaves to complain about how one just can&#8217;t live on", "robots": "index,follow", "copyright": "(c) 2005-2013 United Liberty", "DC.Title": "Quit whining about the minimum wage"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda531\"", "article_summary": "Minimum wage jobs aren\u2019t skilled labor.\nMy wife makes more than minimum wage, but not by a whole lot.\nI\u2019ve heard a lot recently about the minimum wage.\nNow, about the minimum wage.\nJoin the military, go to tech school, find a job that pays more, any of these are viable alternatives to the minimum wage job."}
