Students speak only Cherokee while they learn grade level state standard curriculum and also learn to read and write the 86-character Cherokee syllabary.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re making history every day with these children, since there are very few programs out there we can compare to in terms of bilingual education and preservation of a native language,\u201d Cherokee Immersion Charter School Principal Holly Davis said. \u201cThese students are doing something very unique so that our next generation will carry on our tradition and language.\u201d\n\nThe sixth-grade graduates include Liam McAlpin, Alexis Kelley, Hondo Kirk, Sinihele Rhoades and Daylon Dunn, of Tahlequah, and Solomon Winn, of Briggs.\n\n\u201cNow I can talk to most of the elders, and they\u2019re really happy when I talk to them in Cherokee,\u201d said Rhoades. \u201cIt\u2019s good for them to know that people are still trying to learn the language and keep it alive.\u201d\n\nKelley said she shares what she learns with her family.\n\n\u201cMy mom is always asking me to teach her, and I think it\u2019ll be fun to teach others, too,\u201d she said.\n\nThe immersion school also graduated 10 kindergarten students in an earlier ceremony on Tuesday. Those students will start the first grade at the immersion school this fall while the sixth-grade class takes courses on the Sequoyah High campus.\n\nThe Cherokee Immersion Charter School is part of Sequoyah Schools. Lead teachers must be state certified to teach, and all teachers must be fluent Cherokee speakers. The school teaches preschool ages to sixth grade on its campus and oversees the learning of seventh- and eighth-graders in the program at Sequoyah High School. The first class of sixth-graders to ever graduate from the school are now in the eighth grade.\n\nFor more information on the Cherokee Immersion Charter School, call 918-207-4900.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Cherokee Immersion Charter School graduated its third group of Cherokee speakers on Tuesday, May 13.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "leeanne", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/05/24/keeping-language-alive-immersion-school-graduates-more-speakers-154888", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/sixth-grade-cherokee-immersion.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "Keeping Language Alive: Immersion School Graduates More Speakers"}, "dcterms.date": "2014-05-24T10:00-04:00", "dc": {"title": "Keeping Language Alive: Immersion School Graduates More Speakers"}, "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/05/24/keeping-language-alive-immersion-school-graduates-more-speakers-154888", "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Cherokee Nation, Language Immersion, Native American Languages", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 2}, "dcterms.title": "Keeping Language Alive: Immersion School Graduates More Speakers"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd32fc\"", "article_summary": "The Cherokee Immersion Charter School graduated its third group of Cherokee speakers on Tuesday, May 13.\nFor more information on the Cherokee Immersion Charter School, call 918-207-4900.\nThe Cherokee Immersion Charter School is part of Sequoyah Schools.\nThe graduating students have been taught the importance of preserving the Cherokee language as part of their cultural identity.\nThe immersion school also graduated 10 kindergarten students in an earlier ceremony on Tuesday."}
