Today’s NASA image of the day is a far more realistic depiction of “Gravity.” Meet the crew of Expedition 38, posing for a portrait in the International Space Station’s Kibo laboratory. The multinational crew includes two NASA astronauts, three Russian cosmonauts and an astronaut from the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency. (Clockwise starting at the top we have Oleg Kotov, Koichi Wakata, Sergey Ryazanskiy, Rick Mastracchio, Mike Hopkins and Mikhail Tyurin.)

The expedition, which began in November 2013, will end next week with the departure of Commander Oleg Kotov, of Russia, along with flight engineers Sergey Ryazanskiy (RSA) and Mike Hopkins (NASA). And though their tenure at the International Space Station didn’t include any amazing covers of David Bowie à la Col. Chris Hadfield, the flight engineers’s laboratory work could change the future of how we treat diseases, send information and even the future of space suits.
