Yet in the world of academic economics, there is often a trend toward an overarching theory of \u201chow everything works\u201d that can be applied across business sectors and international borders.\n\nOn Monday, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences announced that this year\u2019s winner of the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences is French economist Jean Tirole. The 61-year-old economist\u2019s study of the regulation of monopolies and near-monopolies has made it clear that if you try to regulate a newspaper company the way you regulate a telecommunications provider \u2013 or try to shoehorn any other major business into a regulatory scheme built for a different industry \u2013 the result will be failure.\n\nRelated: Europe\u2019s New Recession Is Just One of the West\u2019s Problems\n\nTirole\u2019s research at its most basic focuses on firms with \u201cmarket power.\u201d These companies are so dominant in their fields they don\u2019t risk losing customers when they raise prices above the marginal cost of their products.\n\nEconomic theorists, particularly of the free market variety, tend to assume that market failures \u2013 generally, situations where a provider of goods or services is not faced with competitors who force prices down \u2013 are few and far between. In reality, consumers deal with market failures every day.\n\nIn many cities, there are only one or at most two significant daily newspapers. Many Americans have only one choice for their cable television service, their utility provider, and in some parts of the country, their grocery stores.\n\nTirole noted that traditional economic theory, when it recognized market failures, tended to identify only the extremes: perfect competition and the existence of a monopoly.\n\nRelated: Central Banks Can\u2019t Solve What\u2019s Ailing Markets\n\n\u201cThere are two main difficulties,\u201d the Nobel Committee wrote in a summary of Tirole\u2019s work. \u201cFirst, many markets are dominated by a few firms that all influence prices, volumes and quality. Traditional economic theory does not deal with this case, known as an oligopoly, instead it presupposes a single monopoly or what is known as perfect competition. The second difficulty is that the regulatory authority lacks information about the firms\u2019 costs and the quality of the goods and services they deliver. This lack of knowledge often provides regulated firms with a natural advantage.\u201d\n\nTirole helped solve the problem of how to regulate large firms that contract with governments in a way that allows them to earn a profit while assuring they don\u2019t gouge customers on pricing.\n\nIn his research, Tirole developed a theory of how governments can effectively craft individualized regulatory regimes for large, monopoly-like companies. These companies compensate for the government\u2019s lack of full knowledge of the business by creating incentives for the companies to minimize the costs the government understands least.\n\nRelated: 17 Billion Reasons This Oil Exec Says His Company Grew Without Him\n\nFor example, a company whose production costs are difficult to understand, and which might be the basis for artificially inflated prices, can be offered a contract that offers relatively high compensation for the services it delivers, but lower compensation for the costs it incurs. This creates an incentive for the company to lower its costs as much as possible.\n\nCiting the \u201cgreat practical significance\u201d of Tirole\u2019s work, the committee wrote, \u201cHe has penetrated deep into the most central issues of oligopolies and assymetric information, but he has also managed to bring together his own and other\u2019s results into a coherent framework for teaching, practical application, and continued research.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The French economist Jean Tirole, honored today with the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences, helped governments understand how to regulate large, monopoly-like firms without overly distorting either pricing or profits.", "title": "Economics Nobel Winner Researched Regulating Oligopolies", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/10/13/Economics-Nobel-Winner-Researched-Regulating-Oligopolies", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/10132014_Jean_Tirole.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/10/13/Economics-Nobel-Winner-Researched-Regulating-Oligopolies", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/10132014_Jean_Tirole.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The French economist Jean Tirole, honored today with the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences, helped governments understand how to regulate large, monopoly-like firms without overly distorting either pricing or profits.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe14f0\"", "article_summary": "On Monday, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences announced that this year\u2019s winner of the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences is French economist Jean Tirole.\nThe second difficulty is that the regulatory authority lacks information about the firms\u2019 costs and the quality of the goods and services they deliver.\nThe telecommunications business, the newspaper business, and the banking business may all seem to be hugely different sectors of the economy \u2013 to a layman, that is.\nIn his research, Tirole developed a theory of how governments can effectively craft individualized regulatory regimes for large, monopoly-like companies.\nRelated: Central Banks Can\u2019t Solve What\u2019s Ailing Markets\u201cThere are two main difficulties,\u201d the Nobel Committee wrote in a summary of Tirole\u2019s work."}
