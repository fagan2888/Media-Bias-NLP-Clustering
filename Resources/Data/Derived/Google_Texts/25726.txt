ANALYSIS/OPINION:

“In a hyper-competitive fight for ratings as cable news viewership drops, MSNBC has seemed about as clever and competitive as a piano falling down a flight of stairs. Last Wednesday, the network hit a ten-year-low with an average audience in the demo of just 50,000. From 4 p.m. to midnight, none of MSNBC’s shows was able to break 100,000 viewers in the demo, which has long been considered a cut-off for viability in cable news,” observes Mark Joyella, a columnist for TVNewser.com

“It wasn’t a fluke - the network’s shows on Friday again failed to break 100,000 in the demo, with Chris Hayes and Rachel Maddow both fighting not for second place against CNN, but for third place with Forensic Files on HLN,” Mr. Joyella points out.

Could anything help them? In a hypothetical scenario, he broaches the idea that suspended NBC anchorman Brian Williams could be granted a show on the struggling network, doing news plus a late-night monologue, complete with house band and guests. “Brian Williams Unplugged,” Mr. Joyella suggests, might be a panacea.

Stranger things have happened.
