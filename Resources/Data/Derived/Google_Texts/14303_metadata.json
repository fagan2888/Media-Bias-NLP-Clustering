Wayne\u2019s web site: ROOTforAmerica.com .\n\nDonald Trump is a brilliant guy. I have a way for him to end President Barack Obama\u2019s destruction of capitalism and the U.S. economy and save America at the same time.\n\nAre you listening, Donald?\n\nIt takes genius to make billions of dollars in the dog-eat-dog Manhattan real estate world. Trump became the king of Big Apple real estate. Impressive.\n\nBut he\u2019s a step above all that. He\u2019s the only billionaire to extend his fame and mega-success into reality television. Trump might make more money from \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d than from real estate nowadays.\n\nThe Trump brand has increased by billions because of the celebrity factor.\n\n\u201cThe Donald\u201d is the world\u2019s king of branding and promotion. But he\u2019s more than a billionaire businessman and branding genius. He\u2019s a patriot who loves his country and clearly sees that Obama is ruining it.\n\nLike me, Trump is one of the loudest, boldest and most outspoken public critics of this president.\n\nLike me, I\u2019m certain Trump understands the terrible decline of the U.S. economy under Obama is no mistake. It\u2019s a purposeful plan by a radical Marxist tyrant who has always hated America and capitalism \u2013 starting in his college days at Columbia University.\n\nWhat mistake? Obama is the greatest spender in the history of America (and the world).\n\nObama is the greatest debt creator in the history of America. Obama has imposed more regulations than any president in history and is the greatest taxer in the history of America. Obamacare alone is the largest tax increase ever.\n\nBut worse, Obama has tried to impose 442 new taxes that were blocked by a Republican Congress.\n\nIf he was allowed to get his way, Obama would have turned America into Cuba, Venezuela, East Germany or the old Soviet Union. So the failure of the economy is no mistake. There is a plan and it is working.\n\nTrump must understand time is running out for America. Obama has two years left to finish the job. So how do we stop Obama?\n\nThat\u2019s where Trump comes in. Trump has billions. To him, $50 million is a pittance. It\u2019s like pulling $50 from my wallet. It\u2019s time for Trump to put on his white cowboy hat and become the hero that saves our country.\n\nI\u2019m calling on Trump to offer a $50 million reward to any IRS employee (or employees) that come forward with information leading to the impeachment of Obama or the conviction of his top White House aides. The IRS scandal is the smoking gun. My gut instinct says that the orders to target, persecute, intimidate and destroy critics of the president came directly from the Obama White House.\n\nObama knew. He was in the middle of the conspiracy. Obama was there when the game plan was devised. Can he be directly tied to it? Probably not. I\u2019m betting nothing was ever in writing. But his top aides gave the orders to IRS officials. That\u2019s precisely why the emails were destroyed.\n\nNo one would have gone to such an extreme unless those emails tied the orders directly to the highest levels of the White House. The \u201cdog ate my homework\u201d excuse is so pathetic and embarrassing, it proves that those emails held direct evidence of a White House conspiracy. Why else would smart and important people tell such a pathetic lie? Because the alternative is prison.\n\nI\u2019m betting this Obama-IRS criminal conspiracy was coordinated by his top aides (Valerie Jarrett, David Axelrod, Rahm Emanuel). John Gotti could not have thought up a more cunning, vicious crime to punish and intimidate his enemies. Everyone involved must go to prison.\n\nWell, let\u2019s test my gut instinct. The IRS scandal is the best shot we have to impeach Obama, destroy his presidency once and for all, and put a stop to his conspiracy to destroy America, capitalism, American exceptionalism, the U.S. Constitution and Judeo-Christian values.\n\nIt\u2019s time to play hardball. This isn\u2019t badminton at the country club. The future of America is at stake. Our children\u2019s future is at stake. This has to end\u2026 and end now.\n\nThe IRS scandal is the key. Using the IRS to go after political opponents sunk President Richard Nixon. It was the second Article of Impeachment.\n\nThis Obama-IRS scandal is far worse. Obama used the IRS to go after Christian ministers, pro-Israel groups, pro-Constitution groups, veteran groups, conservative groups, cancer victims\u2026 and leading media critics like me.\n\nNow it turns out IRS official Lois Lerner was targeting a GOP United States senator.\n\nAll of this happened while the head of the IRS was meeting at the Obama White House more than any other cabinet secretary, and while the head of the IRS employees\u2019 union was meeting with Obama personally the night before the targeting began.\n\nBut this goes far beyond targeting enemies and trying to silence free speech. Team Obama had lost in the biggest landslide in modern history in 2010. The Tea Party had to be stopped. So Obama used the IRS to steal the 2012 election. Then he appointed big Obama donors to head the IRS and lead the investigation into the scandal.\n\nThen the IRS made sure thousands of emails (the key evidence) were destroyed. This is the grandest, boldest conspiracy in world history.\n\nIt\u2019s also the greatest chance to destroy the Obama presidency, impeach Obama, and convict his top aides of criminal conspiracy against the American people. Or don\u2019t you remember how many of Nixon\u2019s top aides went to prison? What they did is child\u2019s play compared to this IRS scandal.\n\nOnly Trump can make this happen with his money, his mouth, and his celebrity. Offer $50 million. Make the offer so grand that it gets everyone\u2019s attention.\n\nObama can\u2019t control or spin this one. And $50 million will loosen sealed lips. Even Lois Lerner might talk for $50 million. It\u2019s worth a few years in jail to collect $50 million. That\u2019s enough money to get all the rats on the IRS ship to start talking.\n\nAs they come forward to collect their millions, Obama is history. He will go down as the dirtiest president in history. A man who tried to kill free speech. A man who stole the presidency in order to finish the job of destroying the greatest nation in world history.\n\nThink I\u2019m wrong? Let\u2019s bet $150 million. Let\u2019s see who comes forward. I\u2019m betting the floodgates open. I\u2019m betting this is the end of Obama presidency.\n\nNow it\u2019s time for \u201cThe Donald\u201d to get to work. Donald, here\u2019s your chance to save America. Good luck and God bless.\n\nOh and if Trump wants some partners in the deal, I have a funny feeling Sheldon Adelson and Steve Wynn are available.\n\nWayne Allyn Root is the national bestselling author of The Ultimate Obama Survival Guide: How to Survive, Thrive and Prosper During Obamageddon.
