It is more of a change in style and priorities.\n\n\n\n\"What Francis is about is the periphery,\" Pecknold said. \"Now he wants to bring what's in the center to the periphery.\"\n\n\n\nPreaching to the periphery, as Jesus also did, can look a lot like populism, he explained, because it entails a focus on the poor and the marginalized.\n\n\n\n\"These are kind of a specialty of the left in this country, and the right has been more associated with wealth and with power...The rich and the poor distinctions end up looking like right and left distinctions to us too.\"\n\n\n\nPecknold believes Francis' speech Thursday provides a boost to compassionate conservatism and to Republicans who can address issues of the left with policies from the right.\n\n\n\n\"The challenge is not just to the right, the challenge is also to the left,\" he said, noting that the talk of religious liberty and threats to the conscience immediately call to mind the saga of Kim Davis and the church's ongoing opposition to Obamacare's birth control mandates.\n\n\n\n\"What he really lectured Congress on was their responsibility to serve the common good of everyone,\" Pecknold said.\n\n\n\nEnsalaco saw the message to politicians as a bit harsher.\n\n\n\n\"I got the impression of a gentle but stern father scolding their childrenHe was basically saying, 'Why can't you guys get anything done?'\" he said.\n\n\n\nWhile Pope Francis may not understand all the nuances of American politics, Esalaco said he is probably fully aware that by the time he returns to Rome next week, the government could be shut down.\n\n\n\nThe fact that Speaker of the House John Boehner invited Francis to speak before the legislative chamber of the most powerful nation on Earth created an inevitable political atmosphere. The pope just delivered the same message he has been discussing in his other speeches, homilies, and writings.\n\n\n\n\"He's everywhere,\" Ensalaco said.\n\n\n\nAttempting to pigeonhole the Bishop of Rome as an ally of Democrats or Republicans may miss the larger point of what he is trying to communicate.\n\n\n\n\"The idea that Pope Francis is a Democrat is absurd. The message he brings has political consequences to it, but it's not a political message in itself,\" said Christopher Hale, executive director of Catholics in Alliance for the Common Good, a non-profit dedicated to promoting the social justice mission of the church.\n\n\n\nHale said Francis stood before Congress Thursday as a priest, not a politician, but \"it would be naive to ignore the political consequences of his visit.\"\n\n\n\nPope Francis even spoke of the need for Catholics to participate in politics, because as Hale noted, religion and politics share a goal of securing the common good. He approaches issues from a broader worldview, though.\n\n\n\n\"I think the big danger is to try to reduce a global pope into American political labels. He doesn't care about American politics as much as we imagine,\" Hale said. \"While we might imagine ourselves to be the center of the universe, we're not the center of Pope Francis' universe.\"\n\n\n\nThat said, Francis did appear to be calling for an end to ideological separation when he addressed the divisive nature of American politics.\n\n\n\nRepublican presidential candidate Dr. Ben Carson seemed to echo the conclusion that the issues the pope raised are universal, even if liberals and conservatives disagree on how to address them.\n\n\n\nThe former neurosurgeon, who attended Thursday's speech as a guest of Rep. Mark Sanford (R-SC), told Sinclair, \"The fact that he's talking about uplifting things that should be resonating with everybody--you know, taking care of the environment, taking care of life, families. These are good things. How can anybody argue with that?\"\n\n\n\nDemocratic candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) has also praised Francis' agenda, which he described as \"progressive,\" even if the pope did not speak as forcefully on certain issues as Sanders would have liked on Thursday.\n\n\n\n\"I think he does not want to be rude, as a guest,\" he told the Washington Post. \"But I think his calling out for social justice, his talking about income and wealth inequality, his talking about creating an economy and a culture that works for everybody, not just a few, is a very, very powerful message.\"\n\n\n\nSome conservatives have been critical of Pope Francis, though. According to recent Gallup poll, his favorability among conservatives sits at 45%, far below the 71% approval with all Catholics.\n\n\n\nOne Republican congressman refused to attend Thursday's speech, complaining about the pope's focus on climate change.\n\n\n\nConservative commentators on Twitter during the address questioned Pope Francis' positions on the death penalty and immigration. Breitbart.com noted the lack of in-depth discussion of abortion and gay marriage.\n\n\n\n\"They're concerned that even just the change of tone has had repercussions,\" Ensalaco said. While Francis may just be prioritizing other issues about traditional moral concerns, some fear he is abandoning them altogether.\n\n\n\nThe reality, according to Esalaco, is that Francis is not going to change the church's position on issues like divorce or gay marriage. He has just proven to be more inclined to talk about social justice and helping the poor, positions that are consistent with church teachings but not as often discussed.\n\n\n\nThey are also issues where the liberal/conservative lines sometimes blur. For example, the church under Francis may favor a single payer health care system, but it continues to fight hard against mandated birth control coverage.\n\n\n\nFrancis addressed doubts about his handling of social issues while speaking to reporters on his plane earlier this week, according to the Catholic Herald.\n\n\n\n\"I am certain I have never said anything more than what is in the social doctrine of the Church,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\"Maybe I have given an impression of being a little bit to the left...but if they want me to recite the Creed, I can.\"\n\n\n\nHale offered a more blunt assessment of Francis' conservative critics.\n\n\n\n\"What they're revealing is that they're conservatives first and Catholics second,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\"If you have a problem with Pope Francis, you have a problem with Jesus Christ and the Catholic Church. He's not in any way stepping out of our tradition.\"\n\n\n\nEnsalaco observed that there is also traditional precedent for the pope to engage with politics on the international stage. Francis' recent predecessors have taken up active political causes. Pope John Paul II sided with President Ronald Reagan against communism toward the end of the Cold War. Pope Benedict focused on stemming the rise of secularism in Europe.\n\n\n\nIn that context, Pope Francis calling for tougher action on climate change does not seem out of place. Even if he is not trying to make a political statement, though, efforts by the church to help people are often seen that way.\n\n\n\n\"In one sense, they're all political...If you've got 1.2 billion followers, I'm sorry, you're political,\" Ensalaco said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncomponent-story-more_media_horiz-v1-01", "article_metadata": {"description": "Although the public statements of Pope Francis during his visit to the U.S., including his address to Congress on Thursday morning, have often focused on issues that are priorities of the political left, experts say it would be a mistake to apply traditional American political labels to the head of the global Catholic Church.", "title": "Pope's politics defy traditional U.S. liberal/conservative labels", "og": {"site_name": "KRNV", "description": "Although the public statements of Pope Francis during his visit to the U.S., including his address to Congress on Thursday morning, have often focused on issues that are priorities of the political left, experts say it would be a mistake to apply traditional American political labels to the head of the global Catholic Church.", "title": "Pope's politics defy traditional U.S. liberal/conservative labels", "url": "http://mynews4.com/archive/popes-politics-defy-traditional-us-liberalconservative-labels", "image": "http://static-12.sinclairstoryline.com/resources/media/5bbae78a-55de-42b1-a73d-2ee469db09eb-PopeFrancisgreetsthecrowdataparadeinWashingtonDConSe?1448401594339", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "http://twitter.com/#!/krnv", "image": "http://static-11.sinclairstoryline.com/resources/media/5bbae78a-55de-42b1-a73d-2ee469db09eb-PopeFrancisgreetsthecrowdataparadeinWashingtonDConSe?1448401594339", "description": "Although the public statements of Pope Francis during his visit to the U.S., including his address to Congress on Thursday morning, have often focused on issues that are priorities of the political left, experts say it would be a mistake to apply traditional American political labels to the head of the global Catholic Church.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Pope's politics defy traditional U.S. liberal/conservative labels"}, "author": "Sinclair Broadcast Group", "blitz": "mu-cc36119f-f4dca522-3261b206-4b3bbd3f", "robots": "index, follow", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "keywords": "archive,NV", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/krnvnews4", "published_time": "2015-09-25T16:20:18+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=0.5"}, "article_summary": "Pecknold observed four major themes in Pope Francis' public appearances in Washington, DC: migrants, family, religious freedom, and the environment.\n\"While we might imagine ourselves to be the center of the universe, we're not the center of Pope Francis' universe.\"\n\"I think the big danger is to try to reduce a global pope into American political labels.\nHe doesn't care about American politics as much as we imagine,\" Hale said.\nConservative commentators on Twitter during the address questioned Pope Francis' positions on the death penalty and immigration."}
