One person is dead following an auto-vs-pedestrian accident Saturday in the Green Valley Ranch area of Denver.

A pedestrian was struck and killed by a motor vehicle near the intersection of East 47th Avenue and North Tower Road, Denver police spokesman Eranda Piyasana confirmed.

The pedestrian, a male in his mid-to-late 50s, was attempting to cross 47th heading east when he was struck shortly after 2 p.m. by a white Acura traveling south on Tower Road, Piyasana said.

No charges have been filed yet, Piyasana said, as “they’re still trying to determine who is at fault.”

There were no drugs or alcohol involved in the accident and the driver of the Acura is cooperating with police, Piyasana said.

DPD investigators are working to determine if any charges will be filed.

The intersection was closed for several hours Saturday.
