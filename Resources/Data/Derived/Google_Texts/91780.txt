PRISTINA, Kosovo (AP) — Thousands of ethnic Albanians protested in Kosovo’s capital Saturday against a minority Serb politician’s denial of war crimes against them and demanded the government take over the management of the country’s crucial mining complex.

Waving Albanian flags and banners, they called for the dismissal of the Serb Minister Aleksandar Jablanovic, whose comments minimizing Serbia’s role in the 1998-99 Kosovo war especially angered the families of some 1,000 ethnic Albanians still missing.

Police estimated 12,000 protesters showed up. A handful threw rocks at the government building in Pristina, breaking several windows.

Jablanovic is part of the governing coalition along with former Kosovo guerrillas who fought a separatist war against Serbia. Some 10,000 people died in the war when Serbian troops launched a brutal crackdown on separatist ethnic Albanians. The violence was halted by NATO’s 78-day bombing of Serbia, which forced Serb troops in 1999 to give up control of the overwhelmingly ethnic Albanian territory.
