West Pottsgrove, when are you going to start cleaning up your town from the top to the bottom?\n\nI get a lot of mail addressed to \u201chomeowner.\u201d They ought to change that term to \u201chome leaser.\u201d If you stop paying your taxes, then you will really know who owns your home.\n\nTebow\n\nI\u2019d like to leave a nice shout out to Sanatoga Thriftway. Good luck to both the Joes. I worked there myself. The store is going to be sadly missed. Hope you guys do well. Take care of yourselves and hope to see you around. Good luck and goodbye.\n\nMost of the Republicans who are running for president want to appeal Obamacare. What\u2019s that leave the person without health care? Nothing. Just remember that when it comes to voting.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI need information about who to contact about mold in a public building.\n\nIt seems like all these Democrat women are really showing their stuff. We have Kathleen Kane, Hillary Clinton, Nancy Pelosi, all under arrest or either close to it you might say, for all the underhanded things they\u2019ve been doing. I can\u2019t believe it and then they holler about the Republicans how terrible they are.\n\nTo John from Mont Clare, regarding your remark saying these conservative presidents were bad, they were good presidents. Ronald Reagan helped this country; he didn\u2019t put it into recession. And Dwight Eisenhower was a good man; I lived during his presidency.\n\nThis is to JTD. You say Ronald Reagan\u2019s administration created 16 million jobs. I don\u2019t know where you get those figures from because I\u2019ve looked up a lot of stuff and I don\u2019t find anything close to that. I think it\u2019s a bunch of hooey.\n\nI just want to put a shout out to Spring-Ford School Board for raising our taxes and making them one of the highest tax increases in the area yet again for the 15th straight year. When are you going to do something for the taxpayers instead of giving everything to the teachers and administrators? What does the school need that it doesn\u2019t already have, another assistant to the superintendent? When is it the taxpayers\u2019 turn for a favor from the board? Vote them all out.\n\nSpring-Ford Taxpayer\n\nIt amazes me that somebody\u2019s calling about the church using the parking lot at Edgewood School when the Hill School is using it.\n\nTo my critic, over 58 million babies were slaughtered in the womb not because of rape or imperfection but for convenience. There are always minuscule exceptions to any rule so that excuse won\u2019t fly because those few are not part of the 58 million I\u2019m referring to. That\u2019s your typical Democrat answer when there is none.\n\nInfo Depot\n\nPlease stop investigating Hillary\u2019s emails. It\u2019s a waste of time and money. She has already deleted anything that would incriminate her. Don\u2019t you know that she is above the law?\n\nThe president is not the only one making history. Our Republican members of Congress had also made history for being the most dysfunctional Congress in the history of this nation. Forty-seven members of Republican Congress will also be remembered for their letter to the radical right wing extremists in Iran to stop a nuclear deal. No shame.\n\nI have an old refrigerator in the celler that has been closed for some time and when I went to move it, I found that there is a little bit of black mold inside. Before I ask somebody to come and take it away what\u2019s the best way to clean black mold off the inside of appliances and anywhere else for that matter, walls or woodwork or anything? It\u2019s only in the refrigerator right now that I\u2019m concerned about. I would appreciate any information on how to get rid of it.\n\nI\u2019ve been watching the ball games that they have on, the Phils, the Dodgers, the Yankees. It doesn\u2019t matter which one. If they would play as good as they spit constantly, I kind of think that the games would be a lot better. They get paid an awful lot to learn how to spit as much as they do. That\u2019s not teaching our young children to grow up to be more conscious of what they do. Spitting is not one of the things you do.\n\n\u201cAlways remember, the mind is your best muscle. Big arms can move rocks but big words can move mountains.\u201d \u2014 Sylvester Stallone.\n\nJohn from Mont Clare\n\nIf the grocery stores would stick to selling groceries, the drug stores would stick to selling drugs and the liquor stores would sell beer, maybe everybody would have a chance in life. It\u2019s nothing but greed, sheer greed.\n\nSound Off is a forum to spur dialogue from residents of the communities we serve on topics of interest in those communities.
