The median household income (deadset in the middle\u2014half the households are above, half are below) in the metro area rose from $62,081 in 2013 to $66,192 in 2014, an increase of almost 7 percent. That\u2019s still down from their pre-Great Recession highs. The median San Diego-area household\u2019s 2007 income was $70,554 in 2014 inflation-adjusted dollars (the \u201cGreat Recession\u201d officially began in December of 2007).\n\nPeter Brownell, research director at the left-leaning San Diego-based Center on Policy Initiatives, said the effects of the Great Recession are still being felt.\n\n\u201cWe lost a lot of jobs and the jobs that we\u2019ve gotten back as a region have tended to be lower paying jobs,\u201d said Brownell.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of underemployment or poor quality employment that still gets counted as employment,\u201d Brownell said, noting that while the stock market and the housing market have recovered to their pre-recession levels, wages haven\u2019t managed to climb back.\n\nNationally, the median household income was $53,657 in 2014.\n\nBut if the change in San Diegans\u2019 incomes between 2013 and 2014 was modest, the change in the region\u2019s uninsured rate was not. The proportion of residents of the San Diego metropolitan area without health insurance fell nearly a quarter: from 16.3 percent in 2013 to 12.3 percent in 2014. The uninsured rate was 17 percent in 2009, the year the U.S. Census Bureau first began tracking the statistic.\n\nMuch of the coverage of the decline nationally has pointed to the insurance mandate under the Affordable Care Act, and while Brownell cautioned that causation is difficult to prove, he allowed that Obamacare (as the law is popularly known) probably had a big role to play locally, too.\n\n\u201cI would assume that the ACA really is the driving force behind most of that change,\u201d Brownell said, mentioning the state\u2019s Covered California health insurance exchange and concurrent expansion of Medi-Cal under the Act.\n\nThe release of the Census Bureau\u2019s data comes amidst contentious debates in San Diego and throughout California about raising the minimum wage.\n\nNext June, San Diego city voters will be asked to approve a minimum wage hike that will reach $11.50 per hour in January 2017.\n\nA bill that would have raised the state\u2019s minimum wage to $13 an hour over the next two years failed last month to pass the state Assembly just a day after a poll showed two-thirds of Californians favored a $15-an-hour minimum wage by 2021.\n\nThe statewide minimum wage is $9 an hour and will increase to $10 an hour in January.\n\nLos Angeles and San Francisco were among several cities to increase their minimum wages above the state minimum this year.\n\nAnd even as incomes rose and more San Diego-area residents gained access to health insurance, the prevalence of poverty in the region remained stubbornly static.\n\nMore than 14 percent of residents were below the poverty level \u2014 a variable measure of annual income that can reach as low as $12,316 for a single adult without children \u2014 in 2014, statistically unchanged from the 15.2 percent of residents below the poverty level in 2013.\n\nAnd 18.9 percent of children who were below the poverty level in 2014, also statistically unchanged from the 19.4 percent who were in 2013.\n\nBrownell, who said he was surprised the rate didn\u2019t decrease even slightly given the improving unemployment rate (California\u2019s was 6.2 percent in July), said the terrible job market during the Great Recession continues to exert downward pressure on wages.\n\n\u201cPeople may be back to work now but the economy and the kind of jobs that are out there have changed in such a way that even if they\u2019re working, they\u2019re not earning enough to support their family and bring their family up above the poverty line,\u201d noting that of the adults who were in poverty in 2014, more than 40 percent worked during the previous year.\n\nNationally, 14.8 percent of individuals lived below the poverty level in 2014.\n\n\u201cThe recovery hasn\u2019t made its way down to the folks who were hardest hit by it,\u201d Brownell said. \u201cThey\u2019re still pretty much where they were during the Great Recession.\u201d\n\nWe'll let you know when big things happen.\n\nEmail address:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "San Diego news from inewsource", "description": "The San Diego metro area\u2019s median household income remained lower and the poverty rate remained higher than they were before the Great Recession of 2007-2009, even as the proportion of residents wi\u2026", "title": "San Diegans\u2019 incomes struggling years after Great Recession", "url": "http://inewsource.org/2015/09/17/san-diegans-incomes-struggling-years-after-great-recession/", "image": {"width": 653, "identifier": "http://i2.wp.com/inewsource.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Incomes.jpg?fit=653%2C313", "height": 313}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-18T01:15:09+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-18T20:48:43+00:00"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://i2.wp.com/inewsource.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Incomes.jpg?fit=653%2C313&w=640", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.3"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7496\"", "article_summary": "The median San Diego-area household\u2019s 2007 income was $70,554 in 2014 inflation-adjusted dollars (the \u201cGreat Recession\u201d officially began in December of 2007).\nPeter Brownell, research director at the left-leaning San Diego-based Center on Policy Initiatives, said the effects of the Great Recession are still being felt.\nThe statewide minimum wage is $9 an hour and will increase to $10 an hour in January.\nThe release of the Census Bureau\u2019s data comes amidst contentious debates in San Diego and throughout California about raising the minimum wage.\nBut if the change in San Diegans\u2019 incomes between 2013 and 2014 was modest, the change in the region\u2019s uninsured rate was not."}
