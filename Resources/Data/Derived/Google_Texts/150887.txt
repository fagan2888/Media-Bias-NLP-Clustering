The Medicare Part A deductible – for inpatient hospital, skilled nursing facility and home healthcare services – will increase by $44 in calendar year 2015 to $1,260, while the monthly Part A premium will decline by $19.

Medicare Part B monthly premiums and deductibles will remain unchanged. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services announced the calendar year 2015 rates last week.

Daily Medicare coinsurance amounts will be $315 for days 61-90 of hospitalization in a benefit period; $630 for lifetime reserve days; and $157.50 for days 21-100 of extended care services in a skilled nursing facility in a benefit period.

The Part A premium, which is paid by just 1 percent of beneficiaries who have fewer than 40 quarters of Medicare-covered employment, will decline by $19 in CY 2015, to $407.

The base Part B monthly premium and annual deductible – for physician and hospital outpatient services, certain home healthcare services, durable medical equipment and other items – will be unchanged for CY 2015 at $104.90 and $147, respectively. The base Part B premium is adjusted upward for higher income beneficiaries.
