Ted Cruz says he speaks for most Americans about stopping Obamacare\n\nMr. Obama\u2019s supporters followed up Sunday on Facebook and Twitter with a daylong stream of posts citing the crisis in fundraising appeals and urging backers to contact lawmakers and weigh in on behalf of the Affordable Care Act \u2014 the comprehensive health care law that Republicans have sought to defund.\n\nBut a top House Republican said the president is ignoring a \u201cgolden opportunity\u201d to address Washington\u2019s spending and debt problems.\n\n\u201cHe wants to take the easy way out \u2014 exactly the kind of foolishness that got us here in the first place,\u201d said Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, Washington Republican, in the GOP\u2019s weekly address.\n\nSEE ALSO: Obama: Health law can\u2019t be stopped by govt. shutdown\n\nCongress and the president must agree on a short-term spending bill by midnight Monday to keep the federal government running.\n\nEnrollment in new health-insurance exchanges is set to start Tuesday, just as the government would close for business \u2014 a deadline noted by the president in his address.\n\n\u201cThe Affordable Care Act is one of the most important things we\u2019ve done as a country in decades to strengthen economic security for the middle class and all who strive to join the middle class,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cThat\u2019s also one of the reasons it\u2019s so disturbing that Republicans in Congress are threatening to shut down the government \u2014 or worse \u2014 if I don\u2019t agree to gut this law.\u201d\n\nThe president also criticized Republicans for seeking to negotiate with him over a proposal to raise the nation\u2019s borrowing limit. Without an increase in the debt ceiling by mid-October, the government would default on some of its obligations.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately some Republicans have suggested that unless I agree to an even longer list of demands \u2014 not just gutting the health care law, but things like cutting taxes for millionaires or rolling back rules on big banks and polluters \u2014 they\u2019ll push the button, throwing America into default for the first time in history and risk throwing us back into recession,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cNo one gets to hurt our economy and millions of innocent people just because there are a couple laws you don\u2019t like. It hasn\u2019t been done in the past, and we\u2019re not going to start doing it now.\u201d\n\nBut Mrs. McMorris Rodgers noted that presidents have routinely negotiated with lawmakers in the past when reaching agreements to increase borrowing, from Ronald Reagan to Bill Clinton to Mr. Obama himself in 2011.\n\n\u201cEvery major deficit reduction effort of the last 30 years has been tied to the debt limit. This time should be no different,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, the president is now demanding that we increase the debt limit without engaging in any kind of bipartisan discussions about addressing our spending problem.\u201d\n\nShe said House Republicans have put forward a plan that \u201ccontains cuts and real reforms to build a 21st century economy \u2014 from approving the Keystone pipeline and fixing our outdated tax code to delaying the president\u2019s health care law.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Obama, looking to win the public relations battle over a looming government shutdown, took his case directly to voters this weekend.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "President Obama, looking to win the public relations battle over a looming government shutdown, took his case directly to voters this weekend.", "title": "Obama: \u2018Extreme faction\u2019 of GOP risks govt. shutdown over Obamacare dispute", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/sep/28/obama-extreme-faction-gop-risks-govt-shutdown-over/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/09/27/obamajpeg-01873.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/09/27/obamajpeg-01873.jpg", "title": "Obama: \u2018Extreme faction\u2019 of GOP risks govt. shutdown over", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "description": "President Obama, looking to win the public relations battle over a looming government shutdown, took his case directly to voters this weekend."}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Politics, Social Issues, Cathy Mcmorris Rodgers"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd06c6\"", "article_summary": "President Obama, looking to win the public relations battle over a looming government shutdown, took his case directly to voters this weekend.\nSEE ALSO: Obama: Health law can\u2019t be stopped by govt.\nIn his regular radio address Saturday, the president told Americans that an \u201cextreme faction\u201d of the House GOP is risking an economic calamity to torpedo his health care law.\n\u201cEvery major deficit reduction effort of the last 30 years has been tied to the debt limit.\nBut a top House Republican said the president is ignoring a \u201cgolden opportunity\u201d to address Washington\u2019s spending and debt problems."}
