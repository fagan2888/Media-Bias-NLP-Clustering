The health insurance exchange\u2019s website crashed less often and had fewer bugs, and would-be enrollees got their calls for help answered in minutes instead of hours.\n\nBut behind the scenes, MNsure\u2019s software still has major problems. The expensive software meant to handle low-income people who qualify for public health programs is buggy and missing key features almost a year and a half after its public debut.\n\nThe result is a massive headache for counties as they try to manage their public assistance caseloads. Simple software tasks that should take five minutes instead takes 90 minutes hand-typing the same data over and over again. Other basic tasks are impossible for county workers, such as closing a case. And hundreds of thousands of low-income Minnesotans are being managed using software from the early 1990s just because, for all its problems, it\u2019s still better than the MNsure software.\n\n\u201cA year after implementation, MNsure remains woefully inadequate for managing public health care programs, and counties are reaching a tipping point to effectively manage the fallout of the lack of basic functionality,\u201d said Linda Bixby, Washington County\u2019s division manager for community services, at a recent MNsure board meeting.\n\nState officials say they intentionally put off fixing these issues last year to focus on fixing the MNsure website, because it was the public face of Minnesota\u2019s coordinated health system. Now they\u2019re turning their attention to these less-visible software problems \u2014 the so-called \u201cback end\u201d \u2014 and hope to fix many but not all of them this year.\n\n\u201c(It) probably ends up being a two-year plan for getting the remaining functionality into place,\u201d said Chuck Johnson, deputy commissioner for policy and operations at the Minnesota Department of Human Services. \u201cOur goal at this point (is) to make significant improvements on the back end in 2015.\u201d\n\nCastigated by lawmakers this week for problems with MNsure\u2019s software, MNsure\u2019s CEO Scott Leitz promised work was under way on them.\n\n\u201cIt absolutely is at the top of the priority list, because those are critical things that need to be in place,\u201d Leitz said.\n\nThat can\u2019t come soon enough for county workers like Marti Fischbach, Dakota County\u2019s deputy director of employment and economic assistance.\n\n\u201cWe continue to have more and more cases added, and without the additional functionality, it\u2019s feeling like an exponential impact on us,\u201d Fischbach said at the MNsure meeting. \u201cIt\u2019s becoming more and more unmanageable to work on these cases and help people.\u201d\n\nJerry Vitzthum, the director of economic assistance for Anoka County, agreed.\n\n\u201cI think they\u2019re sincere that they want to get it done,\u201d he said of the state\u2019s promises. \u201cBut they\u2019ve got to deliver. We\u2019re not going to be able to handle the numbers unless they do.\u201d\n\nHOW IT WORKS\n\nMNsure was built to a be a one-stop-shop for health coverage in Minnesota. People visit MNsure\u2019s website, and after inputting information are told whether they\u2019re eligible for Medical Assistance or MinnesotaCare, the state\u2019s public programs, or a private health plan on MNsure\u2019s marketplace.\n\nIt\u2019s intended to make things smoother: whichever program people are eligible for, they can get it all done at one place.\n\nBut behind the scenes, nothing is smooth. Someone who earns at least 200 percent of the poverty line gets sent to private insurance companies \u2014 who have their own problems interacting with MNsure. People who earn less than that get sent to the Department of Human Services to enroll in Medical Assistance or MinnesotaCare.\n\nTo do so, however, their information has to be sent to MNsure\u2019s computer software.\n\nMinnesota\u2019s not unique in this. As part of the federal Affordable Care Act, the federal government provided increased funds to states around the country to upgrade their Medicaid computer software.\n\nWHAT\u2019S NOT WORKING\n\nOne of the biggest issues Minnesota is facing is that different parts of the state\u2019s database aren\u2019t communicating with each other.\n\nFor example, updating a person\u2019s income in one part of the database is supposed to change that person\u2019s income everywhere. As intended, the system would automatically determine any effects on that person\u2019s eligibility for programs.\n\nIn practice, case workers \u201chave to go into multiple different screens and enter the same data in different places\u201d to get the system to make the change, Johnson said.\n\nThat\u2019s how what used to take five minutes now takes 45, 60 or even 90 minutes.\n\nWith all that time spent typing in data, case workers can\u2019t handle as many cases per day. That\u2019s forced counties to hire extra staff.\n\n\u201cThe result really is confusing to clients, and it\u2019s incredibly costly for counties to administer,\u201d Bixby said.\n\nIn Anoka County, for example, the Medical Assistance budget is up by about 15 percent to cover extra costs incurred by the software problems.\n\nOther tasks are impossible for counties to do. Instead, state workers have to do everything \u2014 which created a huge backlog.\n\nDHS is supposed to check every year to see if people on public health programs are still eligible for those programs. But in the chaos of the new software and the MNsure rollout, that didn\u2019t happen for parts of last year.\n\nThat means some people potentially continued receiving benefits for a year or more that they were no longer eligible for. An audit last year found several such cases in a random sample of benefit recipients.\n\nJohnson said that backlog was a real problem last year but has been largely addressed, though individuals can still suffer delays in having their status resolved.\n\n\u201cA lot of those have been resolved since then,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nJoel Alter, who led a recent audit of MNsure for the Minnesota Office of the Legislative Auditor, said it would surprise him if the backlog was gone, given how big it got, but that he couldn\u2019t verify it one way or other.\n\nBENEFICIARIES LEFT IN LIMBO\n\nWhile some people may have gotten benefits they weren\u2019t entitled to because of the software glitches, other beneficiaries have suffered.\n\nThe software bugs mean it can take a lot longer than it should to give someone benefits they\u2019re eligible for.\n\nDHS will give benefits retroactively once they\u2019re confirmed, Johnson said. But that means a period of limbo where a recipient might need medical attention without knowing for certain if it will be covered or not.\n\nJohnson said those people can talk to their case workers for clarity until their eligibility is formally established.\n\nFischbach cited one extreme case in which a person with disabilities needs services but can\u2019t get them because of a computer bug. The person with disabilities could be forced to go to a nursing home because they can\u2019t get the outpatient services they\u2019re entitled to.\n\nCOUNTIES USING LEGACY SYSTEMS\n\nThe problems might be worse if it weren\u2019t for the state\u2019s two pieces of legacy software that have managed public assistance cases for decades. Two programs, one called MAXIS, the other MMIS, were implemented in the early 1990s.\n\nBoth are based on mainframe computers and are controlled by keyboard commands, not by pointing and clicking with a mouse.\n\nMNsure was supposed to replace MAXIS and MMIS \u2014 a long-overdue update.\n\nThe old programs \u201cbasically uses formats and software and things that you just can\u2019t sustain over time because it\u2019s so old,\u201d Alter said.\n\nDHS has had to pull experts out of retirement to help maintain MAXIS and MMIS, commissioner Lucinda Jesson said this week.\n\nThe state\u2019s original plan was to move all the state\u2019s public assistance cases from MAXIS and MMIS to MNsure in 2013. But that got delayed, and then delayed more when MNsure debuted to intense software difficulties.\n\nInstead, the state now has a divided system. About 500,000 people are being handled through MAXIS and MMIS, while another 386,219 are being managed through the MNsure software.\n\nHISTORY REPEATS ITSELF\n\nThis sort of software problem isn\u2019t new for Minnesota\u2019s public health programs.\n\nThe Department of Human Services has been wanting to replace MAXIS and MMIS for more than a decade, and in 2003 it launched an ambitious replacement project called HealthMatch.\n\nIt fell prey to many of the same problems that would hamstring MNsure a decade later: poor communication between the state and its contractor, disagreements, software glitches and cost overruns. In 2008, HealthMatch was cancelled without ever being released. Its final price tag, when the last lawsuits were settled years later, was $41 million.\n\n\u201cDHS finally said, we\u2019ve spent enough on this, we\u2019ve gotten too little,\u201d Alter said.\n\nInstead, it decided to focus on developing a new system. That ended up being MNsure.\n\nJesson said one reason Minnesota decided to build MNsure, instead of letting the federal government run Minnesota\u2019s health insurance exchange, was to \u201cleverage federal funding\u2026 to build a human services IT system we desperately needed.\u201d\n\nAnd though HealthMatch was lingering as \u201cthe lesson of what not to do,\u201d Alter said, it also ended up in trouble.\n\n\u201cWith MNsure, we at least have a system that has in fact been enrolling people,\u201d he said. \u201cBut again there are certain elements to it that have been so problematic.\u201d\n\nDavid Montgomery can be reached at 651-224-5064.

Individuals seeking health coverage sign up on MNsure, which routes them either to private insurance plans or public assistance, depending on their income.\n\n\u2014 The MNsure project also includes software to help manage these customers once they\u2019ve signed up for coverage.\n\n\u2014 But the software behind MNsure is having major difficulties.\n\n\u2014 County workers have born the brunt of these software problems.\n\n\u2014 State officials say fixing these software problems are now their top priority after addressing issues with MNsure\u2019s website last year.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "twincities", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Twin Cities", "description": "By last year\u2019s extremely low bar, this year\u2019s MNsure enrollment period was a technological success.
