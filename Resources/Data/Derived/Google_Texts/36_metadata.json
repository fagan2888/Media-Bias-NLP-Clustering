The state Commerce Department shows the average annual interest rate on these types of loans exceeded 260 percent last year. The average customer takes out nearly 10 such loans a year.\n\nNew regulatory reforms wouldn\u2019t \u201cbe a disaster,\u201d said Rep. Joe Atkins, DFL-South St. Paul. \u201cBut on the same token, I don\u2019t want to put them out of business. I just want to put reasonable interest rates in place.\u201d\n\nAtkins, the 2014 sponsor of a payday lending reform bill, said consumers should explore other options before turning to payday loans. He said they could figure out a payment plan with a creditor, request an advance from an employer or turn to nonprofits who offer emergency aid, such as Exodus Lending, a small lending program started by a Minneapolis church.\n\nThough a specific proposal has yet to be crafted, other states\u2019 reforms can provide guidance as lawmakers try to strike a balance that protects consumers and avoids putting lenders out of business.\n\nGraphic: Explore 13 years of a payday lender's political spending Graphic: Explore 13 years of a payday lender's political spending\n\nNick Bourke, director of Pew Charitable Trusts\u2019 research on small dollar loans, said other states have primarily implemented three types of reforms: lower interest rates, a limit on the number of loans and offering consumers a longer repayment period with more affordable payments.\n\nThe least effective of the three is the limit on the number of loans because \u201cit allows a harmful product to stay on the market,\u201d Bourke said. \u201cBecause the payday loan looks artificially good to people, it looks like a short-term loan for a fixed fee. In reality, the typical borrower is in debt half the year and that balloon payment on the loan takes a third of their next paycheck.\u201d\n\nSen. Branden Petersen, R-Andover, said his biggest concern is the possibility that consumers would be left with no other alternative for quick, emergency cash. He doesn\u2019t oppose reform efforts, but said any solution would need to be carefully considered.\n\n\u201cEach proposal we would have to take a look at and judge the merits of,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cI haven\u2019t seen a silver bullet.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, local nonprofits have been working on an initiative with banking partners to develop credit-building products for low-income residents, said Tracy Fisch\u00adman, executive director of Prepare + Prosper, a St. Paul nonprofit. It is expected to launch next year.\n\nFischman said her nonprofit encourages clients to use tax refunds to build savings. For many low-income Minnesotans, tax refunds are huge windfalls that can help springboard them into financial independence, she said.\n\nPayday lenders may fill a void but hurt consumers in the long run, she added. That\u2019s why she supports rules being drafted by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. \u201cUltimately, our goal is to help increase assets and savings and reduce reliance on the alternative marketplace, including payday lending,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "Minnesota lawmakers are expected to introduce legislation next year to curb payday lending, but finding a fix won&rsquo;t be easy.", "title": "Minnesota legislators to try again on payday loan reforms", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/minnesota-legislators-to-try-again-on-payday-loan-reforms/321936171/", "image": {"url": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_139233738637646.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "width": 1200, "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_139233738637646.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "twitter": {"description": "Minnesota lawmakers are expected to introduce legislation next year to curb payday lending, but finding a fix won&rsquo;t be easy.", "title": "Minnesota legislators to try again on payday loan reforms", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/minnesota-legislators-to-try-again-on-payday-loan-reforms/321936171/", "image": {"src": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_139233738637646.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_139233738637646.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "description": "Minnesota lawmakers are expected to introduce legislation next year to curb payday lending, but finding a fix won&rsquo;t be easy."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc937b\"", "article_summary": "\u201cBecause the payday loan looks artificially good to people, it looks like a short-term loan for a fixed fee.\nMinnesota lawmakers are expected to introduce legislation next year to curb payday lending, but finding a fix won\u2019t be easy.\nPayday lenders also opposed efforts to cap interest rates, arguing that rate and loan caps would wipe them out entirely.\nLegislators previously proposed limiting to four the number of payday loans consumers can take out, but the effort failed after Payday America, the largest such lender in Minnesota, spent more than $300,000 to kill the bill.\n\u201cUltimately, our goal is to help increase assets and savings and reduce reliance on the alternative marketplace, including payday lending,\u201d she said."}
