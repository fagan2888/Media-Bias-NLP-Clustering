As voted on by the players, the holdovers were quarterback Peyton Manning and free safety/special teams ace David Bruton. Of more interest were the new faces: defensive tackle Terrance Knighton, defensive end DeMarcus Ware and receiver Demaryius Thomas.\n\nKnighton impacts those around him through humor and candor. Watching him during warmups and at practice, it\u2019s no surprise that he was named captain. Teammates gravitate toward him, listen to him. He has the ability to \u201cbe an icebreaker,\u201d unafraid to tackle difficult topics or address tough issues with teammates.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s an awkward situation or awkward conversation, they know I am going to speak my mind,\u201d said Knighton, who was last a captain his senior year at Temple. \u201cThat\u2019s my personality. \u2026 Once you have that \u2018C\u2019 on your jersey, you are almost obligated to do the right thing.\u201d\n\nThomas admitted that the honor caught him off guard. If for no other reason, he\u2019s the strong silent type. Teammates recognized his work ethic.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if you all really know, but I don\u2019t really talk much in front of the team,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cI like to lead by example. But I feel like I\u2019ve got a bigger role, so I have got to figure out what I am going to do. I believe I will be fine.\u201d\n\nWare\u2019s selection came as no surprise. He functions as a coach on the field, and brings a professionalism and focus that\u2019s impossible to miss.\n\n\u201cThese guys have shown the work ethic, shown the way they deal with their teammates and shown their leadership ability over the last three-and-half, four months,\u201d coach John Fox said. \u201cA lot of them have made immediate impacts. A guy like DeMarcus. And Demaryius, you\u2019ve seen his growth. It\u2019s kind of fun to see. I feel good about who the players voted for.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "David Bruton,DeMarcus Ware,Demaryius Thomas,Peyton Manning,Terrance Knighton", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "First-and-Orange", "description": "Leadership varies, coming in different sizes and voices.
