Ooooooooh gurl!

We didn't know it was possible to look so posh and fierce while preggers, but Olivia Wilde has DONE IT!

The engaged actress flaunted her baby bump at Her premiere in El Lay on Thursday in a cobalt blue David Koma dress along with some ferosh cap-toe Jimmy Choo pumps!

Not to mention, the metallic accents perfectly compliment the HUGE rock on her ring finger! HA!

Love it!!!

What other looks did we fall for this week??!
