Although it did not focus on proposed mergers by Aetna and Humana and Anthem and Cigna \u2014 a hearing in the committee later this month will focus exclusively on that \u2014 it provided the first opportunity for opponents of the mergers, including the American Hospital Association and the American Medical Association, to officially register complaints.\n\n\u201cThose deals appear motivated by top-line profits,\u201d said Rick Pollack, president and CEO of the American Hospital Association, in written testimony. \u201cThe market concentration threatened by the pending insurance deals is large and durable, and consumers and providers are at risk if the deals are allowed to move forward. The two deals promise fewer choices for consumers for commercial insurance and Medicare Advantage plans, narrower networks of providers in what few choices remain, and higher premiums and out of market cost, among other things.\u201d\n\nThomas Greaney, director of the Center for Health Law Studies at St. Louis University said \u201cevidence of the effect of market concentration in commercial insurance markets, although not as robust as for hospital markets, also indicates that insurance mergers have led to higher premiums for consumers.\u201d\n\n\u201cRetrospective studies of health insurance mergers have found significant price increases following consolidation,\u201d Greaney said.\n\nYet Aetna spokeswoman Cynthia Michener said, \"The businesses that will lead health care in the future will not be the biggest, they will be those offering the best products and services.\"\n\nAetna has struck a deal to buy Humana for $37 billion, which would cover 33 million members. Anthem, a Blue Cross and Blue Shield insurer, wants to buy all of Cigna's shares in a cash and stock transaction that would cost $54 billion and cover 53 million members.\n\nThe future of both deals is now in the hands of the Justice Department\u2019s anti-trust division and the Federal Trade Commission. Those regulators face a complex review process given the size of the insurers and the markets they serve.\n\nThe insurers involved in the mergers, backed by the American Health Insurance Plans (AHIP), a health insurer association, say the mergers will result in better health care quality and lower costs.\n\n\"Together, Anthem and Cigna, who have limited overlap in a highly competitive industry, will be in a better position to improve consumer choice and quality,\u201d Anthem said in a statement. \u201c Most of all, we will be better able to lead the transition to value-based care that will reduce costs while improving health outcomes.\u201d\n\nBut the American Medical Association released a report this week that said the pending insurance deals would drastically lessen consumer health plan choices in 154 metropolitan areas within 23 states.\n\nThe report also said the proposed Anthem-Cigna merger \"would diminish competition in up to 111 metropolitan areas within all 14 states that Anthem currently operates,\" including Connecticut, Maine, New Hampshire and New York.\n\nAHIP counters that the AMA study is \u201cfatally flawed.\u201d\n\n\u201cOnce again, the AMA is recycling misleading data that does not accurately reflect the market today,\u201d said AHIP spokeswoman Clare Krusing. \u201cThis latest analysis derives from the same fatally flawed study that has consistently been debunked by leading health care economists. Families and employers in every state have multiple choices of both insurance plans and types of coverage.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, opposition to the mergers is mounting.\n\n\u201cWe commend today\u2019s hearing and other efforts by Congress and federal regulators to conduct a thorough examination of the significant consolidation occurring in the health care marketplace, perhaps most notably the proposed Anthem-Cigna and Aetna-Humana mergers,\u201d the National Community Pharmacists Association said in a statement released Thursday. \u201cPolicymakers cannot allow the \u2018merger mania\u2019 gripping the nation to proceed in a way that harms patients and the community pharmacists who serve them.\"\n\nMerging with Humana would give Aetna more than one-quarter of the total Medicare Advantage market, analysts say.\n\nAt the Judiciary Committee\u2019s hearing, Barbara L. McAneny, a member of the AMA\u2019s Board of Trustees, said there are \u201cfewer and fewer\u201d Medicare Advantage plans.\n\nMcAneny said she\u2019s seen consolidation result in plans \u201cwhere (a patient\u2019s) primary care doctor is on one plan and the specialist is on another.\u201d\n\nAetna disagrees.\n\n\"In the Medicare space \u2013 which is the focus of Aetna\u2019s proposed acquisition of Humana \u2013 beneficiaries are now able to choose from an average of 18 Medicare Advantage plan options, in addition to traditional fee-for-service Medicare,\" Michener said. \"Given all of these options, 92 percent of Medicare beneficiaries choose an insurer other than Aetna or Humana.\"\n\nSounding an anti-competitive siren\n\nGoodlatte said he wanted to \u201csound the siren on Obamacare\u2019s anti-competitive practices.\u201d\n\nRepublicans like Goodlatte say the ACA places so many burdens and new costs on the health care industry that mergers are necessary for them to survive economically.\n\nBut witness Greaney of the Center for Health Law Studies at St. Louis University said consolidation in the health care field has been on the march since long before passage of the ACA.\n\n\u201cNothing in the ACA encourages consolidation,\u201d he said.\n\nGreaney was also skeptical that any benefits would come to consumers through consolidation, calling those arguments by \u201cbig insurers and big hospitals\u201d the \u201csumo wrestling theory.\u201d\n\nTo help fight back against critics and win federal approval of its merger with Humana, Aetna has recently hired four high-powered Washington lobbying firms. Cigna has also beefed up its lobbying in Washington, hiring three new D.C. lobbying firms to press its case to merge with Anthem.\n\nIn addition, Marilyn Tavenner, formerly a top health care official in the Obama administration, began a new job last week as chief executive of America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans in Washington.", "article_metadata": {"standout": "http://ctmirror.org/2015/09/10/congress-scrutinizes-aetna-humana-and-anthem-cigna-deals/", "news_keywords": "Health Care, Politics, Washington, Aetna, AHIP, American Health Insurance Plans, American Medical Association, American Medical Society, Anthem, Bob Goodlatte", "original-source": "http://ctmirror.org/2015/09/10/congress-scrutinizes-aetna-humana-and-anthem-cigna-deals/", "og": {"site_name": "The CT Mirror", "description": "WASHINGTON\u2013 Congressional Republicans are blaming a wave of mergers and other types of consolidation by hospitals, pharmaceuticals and insurers, on the Affordable Care Act.
