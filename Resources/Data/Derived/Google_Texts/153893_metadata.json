In its report, Brown\u2019s reporter demonstrated a breathtaking lack of basic knowledge about religion -- certainly about Christianity -- or even what people do when they go to worship services these days. Click here to read that story.\n\nDisclosure: I\u2019ve been a member at Spencerville since 2003, have attended weekly worship there, and still am on the rolls, not having yet transferred my records to a local Adventist congregation in Utah.\n\nOh, some fellow named Dr. Ben Carson is a member there, along with his family. You might have heard about his connections to the Seventh-day Adventist faith.\n\nIt\u2019s not unusual for the press to poke around the church of a presidential candidate\u2019s choice, especially if that church is either little-known or perhaps controversial. In 2008, Trinity United Church of Christ was put under a media microscope not only because Barack Obama was a member there. but also because the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, the pastor, had issued many sermons that were, shall we say, a bit caustic about America and its role in the world. Four years later, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints had a media-led \u201cMormon Moment\u201d when Mitt Romney, a lifelong member, returned missionary and former bishop, ran for the presidency.\n\nNow it\u2019s Adventism\u2019s turn. Gideon Resnick, \u201ca journalist with a fervent interest in politics, peach rings and rap mixtapes\u201d was sent by Brown\u2019s minions on a field trip to inspect this curious tribe of people from which Carson has sprung forth, Quixote-like, to tilt at the White House.\n\nOr so the tone of the article (original headline, \u201cBen Carson\u2019s Church: We\u2019re Glad He\u2019s Not Here\u201d) might have us believe. Buckle your seat belts, gentle reader, because you\u2019re about to discover some amazing, astonishing, out-of-this-world things.\n\nThe Spencerville congregation meets in a church. With wood paneling. And a pipe organ (a rather nice one, if you ask me) and -- gasp! -- stained glass windows. The natives there practice something called tithing and offers envelopes in which donations may be placed. Most astounding of all, these, er, Christians believe some guy named Jesus is going to return to Earth for the \u201cend of times\u201d!\n\nPardon my sarcasm, but Resnick, and perhaps his editors, know little -- and apparently researched even less -- about just what Christians (of just about any stripe) are, believe or do:\n\n\u201dFollowers abide by many elements of Evangelical Protestant doctrine but emphasize the importance of the Saturday Sabbath, promote religious liberty, focus on diet and health, and want to preserve conservative values like same-sex marriage. They are also firm believers in the eventual Second Coming of Jesus Christ and that those who don\u2019t accept him linger in eternal sleep rather than go to hell.\u201d\n\nWhile I was surprised to learn same-sex marriage is now a \u201cconservative value\u201d Seventh-day Adventists want to \u201cpreserve\u201d -- it isn\u2019t generally regarded as a \"conservative\" principle and, no, Seventh-day Adventists don\u2019t endorse it -- it was the \u201cfirm believers in the eventual Second Coming of Jesus Christ\u201d bit that surprised me.\n\nSo far as I am aware, just about every Christian communion in the world today -- Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Lutheran, Methodist, Baptist, Presbyterian, Congregational, Pentecostal and even the Quakers -- are \u201cfirm believers in the eventual Second Coming of Jesus Christ.\u201d That kind of defines Christianity: We\u2019re Christ-followers, and we believe that Jesus will return, as promised at the end of the Gospel accounts.\n\nReporter Resnick, clearly miffed by a request from an Adventist communication director to not interview Spencerville members while on church property, went on to spin all sorts of things about the congregation, and the parent body, that are just patently false. His account is an almost textbook case of why the press \u201cdoesn\u2019t \u2018get\u2019 religion,\u201d to borrow a phrase.\n\nAttending a worship service on November 14, the morning after the terrorist attacks in Paris, France, Resnick hears Adventist Pastor Chad Stuart ask congregants to join in prayer for the victims, suggesting this is one more indicator of the end times, although Stuart \u201ccareful to not distinguish the attacks in Paris as the sole sign of the imminent salvation.\u201d\n\nAnd while the approach of the end of days may seem like an odd idea to some, especially when tethered to calamitous world events like the Paris terrorist attack, 41 percent of Americans said they believe that Christ will return by 2050, according to a 2010 Pew Research Center poll. Carson has an 87 percent approval rating with white born-again evangelicals.\n\nMillions upon millions of American evangelicals have been raised to read their morning newspaper \u201cwith the Bible in their other hand,\u201d to borrow an old phrase. True, date-setting hasn\u2019t worked out well for evangelicals such as the late broadcaster Harold Camping, or for the Millerite forerunners of Adventism, for that matter. Yet for Resnick to call the core belief of millions \u201can odd idea\u201d belies fundamental knowledge of what Christianity is looking towards. Lacking that perspective, it seems difficult for The Daily Beast to enlighten readers, as opposed to titillating them.\n\nResnick\u2019s discussion of what Seventh-day Adventists believe will happen to those who don\u2019t accept Christ as Savior (not, in his words, \u201cgive themselves up for Jesus\u201d), shows still more confusion:\n\n\u201cAt the Second Coming of Christ, the trumpet of God and the voice of the archangel looks down and the dead in Christ will rise first,\u201d Stuart told me. \u201cAt that point people will go up to heaven. We don\u2019t believe in a god that tortures people for all eternity.\u201d This is a departure from the work of [Adventist Church co-founder Ellen G.] White, who referenced hell in many of her writings.\n\nUm, no. Ellen White, whom Adventists believe exercised the gift of prophecy during her years of ministry, believed in annhiliationism, as do present-day evangelicals such as Edward Fudge, Clark Pinnock and the late John R. W. Stott. White may have \u201creferenced hell in many of her writings,\u201d but didn\u2019t depart from the Adventist\u2019s teachings.\n\nThere's tons more that could be disputed here, but space, even pixels, won't allow it. At its core, The Daily Beast article seemed dedicated to producing more heat than light, more sizzle than steak.
