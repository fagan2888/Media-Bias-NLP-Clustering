A man jumped from the 45th floor of the Four Seasons Denver on Thursday. Don't worry, things had a happy ending -- rather than plummeting to the cement, he hovered above it all with a jet pack.

Nick Macomber took a brief, thirty-second flight before safely landing back on the luxury hotel's roof.

His jet packing wasn't without purpose, however. Macomber was being filmed for a one-hour documentary covering the "past, present and future of jet packs on land, in space and over water," to broadcast on the Smithsonian Channel at a later date.
