Organizations as varied as the ACLU and the Koch Brothers took a leadership role in bringing such initiatives to the national stage. Democrats emphasize the social costs of warehousing millions of citizens; Republicans highlight the financial costs. But they both recognize that the status quo is untenable.\n\nRelated: How the Mentally Ill Are Being Warehoused in Prisons\n\nThe House Judiciary Committee this week finalized a bipartisan criminal justice reform package, with a level of cooperation unseen on other issues. The bills include a provision to end the \u201cthree strikes\u201d rule of life imprisonment for those who commit three federal nonviolent drug crimes. They give judges flexibility to alter mandatory minimum sentences, and clean up other parts of the criminal code to remove outdated statutes. They provide resources to deal with inmate mental health problems, encourage alternative sentencing and implement community supervision support.\n\nBut there was one problem: The package also includes a measure that critics believe would make it harder to prosecute white-collar criminals.\n\nIt\u2019s not like we have a problem with runaway prosecutions of corporate executives; if anything it\u2019s the opposite. Practically nobody went to jail for the actions that triggered the financial crisis. The bigger problem we have is the wave of deferred prosecutions for criminal conduct. And after years of failure, the Justice Department is scrambling to prove to the nation that it is serious about corporate accountability.\n\nBut the House\u2019s back-door effort to immunize the executive suite furthers the suspicion that we have a two-tiered system of justice. Even when you try to balance the scales a bit for poor and vulnerable populations, the wealthy and well-connected have to get a gift, too.\n\nRelated: The Left's Latest Big Money Target \u2014 For-Profit Prisons\n\nH.R. 4002, \u201cThe Criminal Code Improvement Act,\u201d contains the controversial provision. The bill, written by Republican James Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin, is among six that the House Judiciary Committee advanced on Wednesday. The meat of the bill comes in Section 11, proposing a \u201cdefault state of mind proof requirement in Federal criminal cases.\u201d\n\nThis would force prosecutors to prove that a white-collar criminal suspect knew their conduct was unlawful, meaning that prosecutors must produce evidence that effectively peers into the mind of the offender. \u201cThe House language violates the basic precept that ignorance of the law is no defense,\u201d said Public Citizen President Robert Weissman in a statement, \u201cand may offer corporations and company executives an \u2018ignorance of the law\u2019 defense.\u201d\n\nThe Obama administration has condemned this effort. Even the Justice Department, not exactly a trailblazer in white-collar enforcement, vocally opposed the bill, arguing that it would \u201csignificantly weaken, often unintentionally, countless federal statutes,\u201d including charges based on recklessness or gross negligence.\n\nRelated: Obama, in Prison Documentary, Says Legal System Has Been 'Unjust'\n\nAs Occupy the SEC points out, we already have serious hurdles to piercing the \u201ccorporate veil\u201d by untangling the layers of management and reaching those ultimately responsible for fraud and abuse. Adding additional burdens of proof could push prosecutors to not bother to pursue otherwise winnable cases.\n\nAt the House Judiciary Committee markup, Democrats John Conyers of Michigan and Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas, co-sponsors of the bill, acknowledged that this legislation could make it harder to hold executives accountable when their firms commit environmental, food safety or financial crimes. But the bill passed anyway by a voice vote.\n\nThis is not an even trade. Nonviolent drug offenders are getting some more flexibility in their sentences, but for the most part they\u2019re still getting sentenced. For white-collar executives, this changes the law to effectively decriminalize their conduct by raising the burden of proof.\n\nAnd of course, making it easier to get away with corporate fraud would give companies free rein to target the very communities already hammered by mass incarceration. Want to sell a dodgy loan or pollute an underprivileged area? No problem, Congress fixed it so no individual would be held responsible.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear yet how this bill got intertwined with the otherwise laudable effort at criminal justice reform. But we can take a guess. Some wily corporate lobbyists figured they could appropriate a bipartisan issue and help their clients. They convinced Republicans, who probably didn\u2019t need much convincing. And Democrats, the minority party in Congress, would have to choose between scrapping reforms to the system that would aid their communities and accepting corporate decriminalization as the price to pay.\n\nThat\u2019s a cruel choice. Congress doesn\u2019t have to attach a benefit for the rich every time we reverse an injustice for the poor. It contributes to cynicism about politics, raising questions over why powerful forces like the Kochs have become so interested in criminal justice reform. Was it all about getting their friends in the country club an immunity badge?\n\nWe\u2019re a long way from equalizing treatment from the justice system for the rich and the poor. But that doesn\u2019t make this little sneak attack any less obnoxious. Let\u2019s hope the White House\u2019s opposition stops it cold.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Amid a fairly depressing Congressional session characterized by gridlock and demagogue", "title": "Congress Is Making It Even Harder to Crack Down on White-Collar Crime", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2015/11/20/Congress-Making-It-Even-Harder-Crack-Down-White-Collar-Crime", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/09252012_money_handcuffs_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2015/11/20/Congress-Making-It-Even-Harder-Crack-Down-White-Collar-Crime", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/09252012_money_handcuffs_article.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@ddayen"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Amid a fairly depressing Congressional session characterized by gridlock and demagogue", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "For white-collar executives, this changes the law to effectively decriminalize their conduct by raising the burden of proof.\nWe\u2019re a long way from equalizing treatment from the justice system for the rich and the poor.\nIt contributes to cynicism about politics, raising questions over why powerful forces like the Kochs have become so interested in criminal justice reform.\nIt\u2019s not like we have a problem with runaway prosecutions of corporate executives; if anything it\u2019s the opposite.\nBut there was one problem: The package also includes a measure that critics believe would make it harder to prosecute white-collar criminals."}
