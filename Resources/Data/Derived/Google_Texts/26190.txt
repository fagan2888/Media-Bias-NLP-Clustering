A new poll finds Idahoans are decidedly opposed to Obamacare’s Medicaid expansion in Idaho, and that almost two-thirds of voters would be less likely to re-elect a legislator who supports Medicaid expansion. The poll was commissioned by the Foundation for Government Accountability and the Idaho Freedom Foundation. The survey found that, when first asked about Medicaid expansion, 46 percent of voters say they’re opposed to Medicaid expansion, 39 percent are supportive and the rest are undecided. “Idahoans don’t want Medicaid expansion. They don’t want more Obamacare and they don’t want to enact another program that competes for precious taxpayer resources,” said Wayne Hoffman, president of the Idaho Freedom Foundation/Idaho Freedom Foundation news release.

Hmm. Here's a poll by Dan Jones & Associates that sez 61% of Idahoans support Medicaid expansion.

Question: Do you agree/disagree with the poll results? Do you want to see the Legislature expand Medicare?
