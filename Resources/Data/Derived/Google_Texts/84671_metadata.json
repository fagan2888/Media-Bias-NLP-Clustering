There\u2019s a new study creating quite a buzz, probably among your friends too: It found parents have a key role in whether their children become little despots.\n\nThe findings, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, found that parents who \u201covervalue\u201d their kids between the ages of 7 and 11 raised children who scored higher on tests of narcissism. In other words, parents who described their offspring as \u201cmore special than other children\u201d and as deserving \u201csomething extra in life\u201d had kids who think they\u2019re God\u2019s gift to the world.\n\n\u201cChildren believe it when their parents tell them that they are more special than others,\u201d said Brad Bushman, co-author of the study and professor of communication and psychology at The Ohio State University. \u201cThat may not be good for them or for society.\u201d\n\nParents should read the findings as a warning that labeling their kids as \u201cextra special\u201d may not be the self-esteem booster previously thought.\n\nHere are ways to keep narcissism at bay in our kids and avoid overusing praise.\n\n\u25a0 Love your kids, warts and all. The more we view our children as flawed (as we ourselves are), the more we will be able to love them in their imperfect state. The ability to recognize failings and to still love and accept them is one of the greatest gifts we can give our children.\n\n\u25a0 Stick to the point with your praise.\n\nThink about how you feel when someone says, \u201cGood job!\u201d as opposed to \u201cYou really nailed that presentation by including those questions at the end. Gave us something to think about going forward with this project.\u201d\n\nGeneral praise is much less meaningful than a compliment on a certain achievement. Our children are no different. When we are as precise as possible in our compliments, we tell them that we truly recognize their effort.\n\n\u25a0 Praise the present. When we talk in terms of \u201calways\u201d or \u201cnever,\u201d we negate the effort right in front of us. We also mar the satisfaction in a job well done if that job is lumped in with the past and future. This means we shouldn\u2019t tell our kids, \u201cYou always do such a nice job\u201d when referring to their room cleaning. What we should say is something like, \u201cYou did a good job on your room today.\u201d\n\n\u25a0 Be sparing, but not a miser, with your praise. When your child has had an overload of praise, she will start to crave it by asking you to compliment every effort she makes. Over-praising can also lead to a child viewing your compliments as meaningless.\n\n\u25a0 Praise what is worthy. More often than not, we tend to not think about what we\u2019re praising our children for. Rather than praising every good grade on a test in a subject that\u2019s easy for your child, praise the effort it took to finish a particularly difficult math worksheet.\n\n\u25a0 Teach the Golden Rule. The concept of treating others as you would like to be treated has taken a beating in today\u2019s all-about- me culture, but it\u2019s, ahem, golden in helping kids not think too highly of themselves. Have your kids memorize \u201cDo unto others as you would have them do unto you,\u201d and use it to check motivations, actions and attitudes in their lives.\n\n\u25a0 Walk in their shoes. The more we can guide our children in thinking about how the situation looks from the other person\u2019s point of view, the less likely they will develop an attitude of superiority. By pointing out how the other person might feel or why the other person might have acted a certain way, we help our kids think through situations with compassion rather than a \u201cwhat\u2019s-in-it- for-me\u201d outlook.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2012/10/05587_00082.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9499\"", "article_summary": "Here are ways to keep narcissism at bay in our kids and avoid overusing praise.\nWhat we should say is something like, \u201cYou did a good job on your room today.\u201d\u25a0 Be sparing, but not a miser, with your praise.\nThis means we shouldn\u2019t tell our kids, \u201cYou always do such a nice job\u201d when referring to their room cleaning.\nBy pointing out how the other person might feel or why the other person might have acted a certain way, we help our kids think through situations with compassion rather than a \u201cwhat\u2019s-in-it- for-me\u201d outlook.\nThink about how you feel when someone says, \u201cGood job!\u201d as opposed to \u201cYou really nailed that presentation by including those questions at the end."}
