As they approach retirement, American workers prepare to step back and enjoy their final years. However, the sheer number of retirees, and the cost of accommodating them, is likely to put an end to these dreams before they begin.\n\nFrom 2000 to 2010, the number of over-65s in the United States increased to 40 million from 35 million, and this number is expected to increase a further 36 percent to 55 million by 2020 as the baby boomer generation reaches retirement. This glut of retirees will leave behind neither the economy nor the workforce needed to ensure a safe and secure old age.\n\nLike many Western countries, the United States has an aging population as a consequence of declining fertility. As more of the population retires, and lives longer in retirement, the burden on those still working increases. Social Security Administration figures showed that in 2012, the ratio of workers to beneficiaries dropped below 3-to-1 for the first time \u2014 the point of stability in the current system \u2014 and that ratio is expected to hit two workers per retiree by 2030. The cracks are already beginning to show. Earlier this year, Detroit became the largest municipality in history to file for bankruptcy, broken by a weakened economy, spiraling debts and crippling pension commitments to public-sector workers.\n\nWhat, then, is the future that today\u2019s septuagenarians face as they come to the end of their working lives? The notion of retirement is a relatively new invention. A century ago, seven in 10 over-65s in the United Kingdom were working. Today, about two in 10 are. (Similar changes have happened in the United States.) It was the advent of state pensions by the German leader Otto von Bismarck in the 1880s that led to the idea that your twilight years ought to be spent in a state of well-earned idleness rather than working until you dropped.\n\nLife expectancy soared\n\nIn the century since, life expectancy has soared, but the retirement age has remained doggedly fixed to this 18th-century standard. \u201cWhen Bismarck introduced the state pension, life expectancy at 65 was 18 months,\u201d says Andrew Hilton, director of the Centre for the Study of Financial Innovation. \u201cNow it\u2019s 23-24 years for men, 27-28 for women.\u201d The number of Americans entering retirement \u2014 and the length of time they\u2019ll spend as retirees \u2014 is unprecedented.\n\nAmong other things, the wealth that is bound up in this older generation will stay there, or trickle out slowly over the next few decades. \u201cAs longevity increases, people will receive inheritance later, in their 60s, when it\u2019s not really useful,\u201d says David Sinclair, assistant director of the U.K.\u2019s International Longevity Centre.\n\nThe knock-on effect of this, he explains, is that elders are opting to transfer their wealth directly to grandchildren, excluding the middle generation entirely. By off-loading their accumulated wealth while still alive, not only do retirees avoid paying estate tax, they are also able to control how that money is spent, for example, by stipulating the cash gifts be used for a college education. This gives older Americans a much more prominent role in the upbringing of their grandchildren.\n\nYet as life expectancy increases, so do living costs and medical bills. Many older people opt to use their homes to pay for these expenses. The equity loans market is booming as homeowners opt to remortgage their houses to generate a reliable stream of income. In the U.S., the number of reverse mortgages increased almost tenfold between 2001 and 2011, from 7,800 to 73,000. (It peaked in 2008, at about 112,000.)\n\nWorking out who foots the bill for an aging population is a not a task that government has embraced with any enthusiasm. It will be very difficult for the government to raise the retirement age for those on existing schemes, for both political and legal reasons. However, the transition from working life to retirement is likely to become far less distinct anyway. Over-65s are increasingly volunteering to stay in work, but this brings mixed benefits. At top-tier roles, they may block progression of junior employees all the way down the chain. Retirees who choose to take on low-skill part-time jobs are attractive hires for business owners, but they displace teen-agers from the same positions. (There aren\u2019t enough Wal-Mart greeter jobs to go around.) Furthermore, if these retirees are still drawing a pension while they work, it does little to ameliorate the financial burden of those commitments.\n\nShort of throwing open the doors to immigration, there is no quick fix to boost the number of workers in the country. Thus, politicians and society at large must engage far more with what purpose retirement holds. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t have people spending 25 years watching TV,\u201d says Sinclair. \u201cThat is a huge waste.\u201d\n\nIf pre-retirement life is dominated by the accumulation of wealth, possessions, skills, and social ties, then perhaps post-retirement ought to be presented as a time to share those gains with society, rather than retreating from it. In general, today\u2019s over-65s are far fitter and healthier than their parents were at this age, and they\u2019re capable of roles that don\u2019t fit a typical view of retirement. For some, finding a way to stay solvent in old age will still form their primary motivation. However, those on fixed-benefit pensions are more likely to only engage on their own terms.\n\nPressured to work\n\nWith career, family, and wealth accumulation behind them, the key may lie in identifying what personal aspirations retirees choose for themselves. Retirees may volunteer in parts of society that are typically underfunded, such as education and child care, or pursue goals without financial motivations, such as music or the arts. As the burden of an aging population on society becomes more evident, however, the existing culture of antipathy toward \u201cshirkers\u201d may well shift to include the indolent elderly. Even America\u2019s senior citizens who don\u2019t need to work could find themselves pressured into doing so by those footing the bill for their retirement.\n\nAdvertisers tend to present only two visions of old age \u2014 those in need of nursing homes and 24-hour-a-day care, and the silver foxes climbing mountains. The reality lies somewhere between the two, but greater efforts are needed to accommodate America\u2019s aging citizens in the fabric of day-to-day society. By their sheer numbers alone, America\u2019s over-65s are destined to be a powerful political, social, and economic force. And if the rest of us hope to make it to our own retirement intact, we need them to be.\n\nFrank Swain is a freelance science writer based in the U.K. He wrote this for Slate.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Is retiring a thing of the past?", "title": "Is retiring a thing of the past?", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/11/21/is-retiring-a-thing-of-the-past/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-11-21T18:24:27+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-11-21T18:24:27+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe207c\"", "article_summary": "It will be very difficult for the government to raise the retirement age for those on existing schemes, for both political and legal reasons.\nLife expectancy soaredIn the century since, life expectancy has soared, but the retirement age has remained doggedly fixed to this 18th-century standard.\nHowever, the transition from working life to retirement is likely to become far less distinct anyway.\nAs they approach retirement, American workers prepare to step back and enjoy their final years.\nHowever, the sheer number of retirees, and the cost of accommodating them, is likely to put an end to these dreams before they begin."}
