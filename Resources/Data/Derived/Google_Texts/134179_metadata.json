Bobby Jindal says that in spite of the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling that Obamacare subsidies are constitutional, the Affordable Care Act still needs to be replaced.\n\n\u201cYou may have seen [the] news that the Supreme Court has ruled that one part of this law is not unconstitutional,\u201d said Jindal during a speech yesterday at the New Hampshire Institute of Politics. \u201cWell, yippy. This is now success? So, if the Congress were to double our taxes tomorrow, and the Supreme Court said that wasn\u2019t unconstitutional, that would be success?\u201d\n\nThe Louisiana Republican said that Obamacare \u201cdecreases our freedom,\u201d forces consumers to buy a product they may not want or need, increases premiums, and forces people into a broken Medicare system.\n\nHe said conservatives must explain how they would replace Obamacare.\n\n\u201cThe court spoke today, but I think the people of America still need to speak,\u201d Jindal said.\n\nJindal said there is an \u201cunprecedented assault on our freedoms\u201d coming from Washington, D.C.\n\nOne of these freedoms, he said, is religious liberty.\n\n\u201cThe United States of America did not create religious liberty,\u201d Jindal said. \u201cReligious liberty created the United States of America.\u201d\n\nJindal, a first generation American, said that his parents came to America looking for freedom and prosperity.\n\n\u201cMy parents came halfway across the world in search of the American dream,\u201d Jindal said. \u201cTo this day it still gives me goosebumps to think of it.\u201d\n\nHis parents came to America from India without ever even seeing a picture of their new home in Louisiana. They had never even flown on an airplane before.\n\n\u201cThey couldn\u2019t even go online and google what Baton Rouge was like,\u201d Jindal said.\n\nHe said he fears that dream is slipping away.\n\n\u201cToday, President Obama and his apprentice-in-chief Hillary Clinton are at war trying to turn the American dream into the European nightmare,\u201d Jindal said.\n\nJindal called Obama a \u201cone-term senator who needed on the job training.\u201d\n\nJindal also criticized one of his many Republican rivals, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll hear some, and Jeb Bush has said this most recently, that we\u2019ve got to be willing to lose the primary in order to win the general,\u201d Jindal said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t disagree with that more. I\u2019m going to translate for you what he is saying: He is basically saying that\u2014and you hear other Republicans say this all the time\u2014that we have got to make the left like us. We\u2019ve got to make the media like us. We\u2019ve got to hide who we are and what we believe.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve tried that,\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd when we\u2019ve done that we\u2019ve lost and we deserved to lose. I\u2019ve got a novel idea: Why don\u2019t we run in an election where we actually embrace our ideas and our principles? Why don\u2019t we tell the American people what we stand for?\u201d\n\nJindal vowed to fight for the unborn, defeat ISIS and oppose Common Core.\n\nHe also expressed support for term limits, a balanced budget amendment and legislation requiring the approval of a supermajority in Congress to raise taxes.\n\nJindal\u2019s visit to the Granite State was his first campaign stop since he launched his presidential campaign Wednesday in Louisiana.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Gov.
