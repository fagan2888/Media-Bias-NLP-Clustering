King, who spent decades thrilling listeners and bringing his mix of blues, jazz and swing into mainstream American music, died Thursday at 89.\n\nKing, whose greatest hits include \u201cThe Thrill is Gone,\u201d \u201cSweet Little Angel\u201d and \u201cThree O\u2019Clock Blues,\u201d recorded more than 50 albums over his roughly 70-year career. He took home 15 Grammy awards, received the President Medal of Freedom and was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Even well into his 70s, the singer toured relentlessly, averaging more than 250 concerts a year around the world.\n\nHis guitar, Lucille, was nearly as famous as he was, best known as a black Gibson ES-355\u2013style guitar and widely considered to represent an extension of his voice. \u201cThe minute I stop singing orally,\u201d King said, according to a biography on his website. \u201cI start to sing by playing Lucille.\u201d\n\nRolling Stone magazine ranks King as the sixth greatest guitarist in history on its Top 100 list, behind Jimi Hendrix, Eric Clapton, Jimmy Page, Keith Richards and Jeff Beck.\n\nHis precise, \u201cevery note counts\u201d guitar style influenced generations of musicians from Clapton to U2.\n\n\u201cWhen he hit the note to bring the band in, my whole life was changed,\u2019\u2019 Carlos Santana said in the 2005 book \u201cThe B.B. King Treasuries,\u201d reprinted by USA Today. \u201cI could see what Michael Bloomfield and Eric Clapton and everybody else saw in him. ... When you play like that, you heal yourself and you heal other people.\u2019\u2019\n\nBB, anyone could play a thousand notes and never say what you said in one. #RIP #BBKing pic.twitter.com/YvZYH8hyJE \u2014 Lenny Kravitz (@LennyKravitz) May 15, 2015\n\nThe thrill is gone .
