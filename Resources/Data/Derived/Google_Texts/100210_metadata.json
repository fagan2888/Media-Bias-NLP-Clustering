So why risk alienating voters? The tactics the House leadership has now endorsed may rev up the hard-core base of the GOP, but it could mean election losses next year.\n\nThat\u2019s the conclusion Karl Rove has reached, according to an op-ed he penned for The Wall Street Journal this week. According to polls his organization conducted, the GOP loses independent voters on the issue of a government shutdown. Rove argues, correctly, that \u201cany strategy to repeal, delay or replace the law must have a credible chance of succeeding or affecting broad public opinion positively. The defunding strategy doesn\u2019t. Going down that road would strengthen the president while alienating independents. It is an ill-conceived tactic, and Republicans should reject it.\u201d\n\nSo what\u2019s the alternative? For many conservatives, the Affordable Care Act is the sine qua non of President Obama\u2019s effort to transform America into a socialist state. But the fact is, the law is so unwieldy and its ambitions so unachievable that it might serve its critics better to let the law take full effect and watch it die of its own deficiencies.\n\nThe entire premise on which the bill passed was that it would make health care universally available and thus cover the estimated 49 million uninsured Americans. But the premise was always wrong. Given the choice to pay a nominal government fine or buy insurance that costs 10 times more \u2014 at a minimum \u2014 most of the uninsured will remain uninsured.\n\nThe key to the law was a provision requiring individuals to buy insurance or pay a fine. But the fines are far less expensive than insurance \u2014 and for many of the uninsured, they will seem the better alternative.\n\nIn 2014, unless the president or Congress delays implementation, individuals will have the choice to buy an insurance policy or pay a $95 fine. If you\u2019re a low-wage worker, young and healthy, the penalty makes more sense than insurance. Even if you\u2019re older and less healthy, you won\u2019t be turned away at an emergency room should you need care. So why enroll?\n\nThe fines go up each year \u2014 $325 in 2015 and $695 in 2016 and beyond \u2014 but at their highest the fines are about half the cost of the cheapest health care plan. And there are plenty of loopholes to get out of paying the fines. If your income falls below the threshold of filing for federal income tax, you\u2019re exempt. You also can seek a hardship waiver from the secretary of health and human services. And if you\u2019re one of the 11 million illegal immigrants living here, you don\u2019t have to buy insurance.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Human Events", "description": "Obamacare is a house of cards just waiting to fall of its own weight.", "title": "Let Obamacare fail on its own", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://humanevents.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Shamed-into-war-610x400-480x314.jpg", "url": "http://humanevents.com/2013/09/23/let-obamacare-fail-on-its-own/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"pages": 212436860202}, "description": "Obamacare is a house of cards just waiting to fall of its own weight.", "twitter": {"image": "http://humanevents.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Shamed-into-war-610x400-480x314.jpg", "site": "@humanevents", "card": "summary", "description": "Obamacare is a house of cards just waiting to fall of its own weight."}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd172a\"", "article_summary": "And if you\u2019re one of the 11 million illegal immigrants living here, you don\u2019t have to buy insurance.\nThe conservative push to defund Obamacare has no chance of succeeding as long as Democrats have a majority in the Senate.\nThe key to the law was a provision requiring individuals to buy insurance or pay a fine.\nThe entire premise on which the bill passed was that it would make health care universally available and thus cover the estimated 49 million uninsured Americans.\nGiven the choice to pay a nominal government fine or buy insurance that costs 10 times more \u2014 at a minimum \u2014 most of the uninsured will remain uninsured."}
