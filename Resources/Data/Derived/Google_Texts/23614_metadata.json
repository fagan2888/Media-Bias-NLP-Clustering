For herself, favorite treats include dehydrated green beans, while the yummiest selection among her canned cat foods is Tiki brand succulent chicken. \"In the dry kibble, I really like the Italian brand and the Natural Balance,\" Hunter told the Herald.\n\nComments on Hunter\u2019s publicity stunt inevitably include those who compare her actions to the money-saving measures of the very poor. \u201cAs a senior citizen, on social security, I visualize that menu as part of my future,\u201d wrote Carbar4647 in a Fox News comment section. According to the most recent figures from the Department of Agriculture (USDA), 14.5 percent (17.6 million) U.S. households were food insecure at some time during 2012. Of these, 5.7 percent (seven million) had very low food security. As defined by the USDA, very low food security occurs when normal eating patterns of one or more members is disrupted and food intake is reduced at times due to insufficient money or other resources for food.\n\nWhile hunger is an issue for a substantial number of Americans, hunger and obesity often co-exist within the same communities, families, and most shockingly of all, individuals. The non-profit Food Research and Action Center (FRAC) reports that women who were food insecure were more likely to be overweight than women who were food secure. FRAC also notes that childhood insecurity is \u201cassociated with [being] overweight even after controlling for age, race, gender, and family poverty index.\u201d This data suggests that hunger may not exist entirely due to a lack of money but may also be based on poor food choices.\n\nHunter has a mission that goes beyond publicity and she will not be deterred by haters. \"I know people think this is crazy, but I can't stress enough how important it is to read labels and see what's in the food you eat \u2014 whether it's pet food or human food,\u201d she told the Herald. \u201cIf this month of eating pet food enlightens people to the importance of that, then I'll be happy.\"", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "dog food, pet food, cat food, fillers, byproducts", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A store owner has been eating only pet food products since June 19 in order to prove that the food she stocks is as healthy and delicious as human food.", "title": "Food For Thought?
