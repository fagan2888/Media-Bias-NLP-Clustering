That changed last year when she got coverage through the federal insurance marketplace, healthcare.gov, and, with the help of Samuel U. Rodgers Health Center, secured a tax credit to help pay her premium.\n\nShe pays about $60 a month.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nice to have the assurance that if something bad were to happen, I would at least be able to survive it,\u201d Hearting says.\n\nHearting is one of nearly 200,000 Missourians whose health insurance subsidy may hinge on a Supreme Court decision expected in coming days. In Kansas, 70,000 people risk losing their subsidies if the court finds that only enrollees who got their coverage on state-operated exchanges are entitled to them.\n\nLike 32 other states, neither Kansas nor Missouri set up its own exchange. All told, some 6.4 million people in those 34 states stand to be affected by the court\u2019s decision.\n\nWithout the subsidies, most of them will probably be forced to drop their coverage.\n\n\u201cProbably the majority of the folks that are receiving them could no longer afford to pay for their health insurance because they would now be responsible for paying the full monthly premium,\u201d says Sheldon Weisgrau, director of theHealth Reform Resource Project for the Kansas Association for the Medically Underserved.\n\nIf the Supreme Court strikes down the subsidies, Weisgrau says the result would be a classic insurance \u201cdeath spiral\u201d as the only the sickest hang on to their coverage while healthier enrollees drop out, driving up premium costs.\n\n\u201cThere have been estimates that rates will increase anywhere from 50 to 200 percent next year for everybody that\u2019s left in the marketplace and that will accelerate that cycle of people who cannot afford it. (They) will drop out, and those who are sick and really need insurance will figure out a way to pay for it,\u201d Weisgrau says. \u201cAnd insurance markets cannot survive when that\u2019s happening\u201d\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just those who get their insurance through Obamacare that will be affected if the Supreme Court upholds the challenge to the subsidies, Weisgrau says.\n\nInsurers may be forced to raise rates on people who buy their insurance outside of the marketplaces and even on those who obtain coverage through their employers.\n\nThose looking to Congress for help will find little consolation there, according to U.S. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, who represents Missouri\u2019s 5th Congressional District.\n\n\u201cPeople are concerned, and people are scared and rightfully so,\u201d Cleaver, a former Kansas City mayor, says.\n\nCleaver, who supports the Affordable Care Act, says Congress could fix the law to clear up the language that led to the lawsuit. Or it could create a contingency plan to help those in danger of losing their subsidies.\n\nBut in a polarized political environment, he\u2019s less than hopeful.\n\n\u201cI think that people would feel a little better if they had an idea that something could be done in a reasonably short period of time, and I cannot assure them of that,\u201d he says.\n\nIn theory, state legislatures could also act to protect residents and insurers from the loss of their subsidies. But Weisgrau says most states have no backup plan.\n\n\u201cThere are things that our state elected officials could be doing to mitigate the possible adverse effects, and if they have any plans, they are keeping them a secret,\u201d he says.\n\nRight now, Weisgrau admits to feeling a little nervous.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very uncomfortable, because obviously, we\u2019d don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d he says.\n\nWhile it\u2019s unclear how a Supreme Court decision striking down the subsidies will ultimately play out, Amy Hearting says she knows what will happen to her if she loses her subsidy.\n\n\u201cIt would mean that I would lose the insurance again. Getting privately insured \u2013 it would cost more than half of what I pay for rent, and that\u2019s a cost I can\u2019t take on by myself.\u201d\n\nAlex Smith is a reporter for KCUR, a partner in the Heartland Health Monitor team.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health", "description": "Early on a Monday morning, percussionist and music teacher Amy Hearting of Kansas City reads a newspaper outside a coffee shop before going off to teach an", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://kcur.org/post/kansas-missouri-insured-anxiously-await-supreme-court-decision-subsidies", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/kcur/files/styles/medium/public/201506/hearting__amy.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Early on a Monday morning, percussionist and music teacher Amy Hearting of Kansas City reads a newspaper outside a coffee shop before going off to teach an", "title": "Kansas, Missouri Insured Anxiously Await Supreme Court Decision On Subsidies"}, "story_id": 417054713, "twitter": {"site": "@kcur", "card": "summary", "creator": "@kcur"}, "author": "Alex Smith", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Kansas, Missouri Insured Anxiously Await Supreme Court Decision On Subsidies"}, "nid": 75090, "datePublished": "2015-06-24", "keywords": "Affordable Care Act, Heartland Health Monitor", "wordCount": 832, "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdce08\"", "article_summary": "\u201cUnfortunately, it doesn\u2019t come with health insurance, and it doesn\u2019t really come with an annual income where that is an easy reality for me.\u201dHearting, 35, had spent almost her entire adult life without health insurance.\nHearting is one of nearly 200,000 Missourians whose health insurance subsidy may hinge on a Supreme Court decision expected in coming days.\nWhile it\u2019s unclear how a Supreme Court decision striking down the subsidies will ultimately play out, Amy Hearting says she knows what will happen to her if she loses her subsidy.\nIn Kansas, 70,000 people risk losing their subsidies if the court finds that only enrollees who got their coverage on state-operated exchanges are entitled to them.\n\u201cAnd insurance markets cannot survive when that\u2019s happening\u201dAnd it\u2019s not just those who get their insurance through Obamacare that will be affected if the Supreme Court upholds the challenge to the subsidies, Weisgrau says."}
