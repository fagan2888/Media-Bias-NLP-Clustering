Code Black is set to release June 27 and provides viewers with the inner workings of America\u2019s busiest emergency room, and how it copes with the system in place.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re an outsider, this looks like total chaos, but I see unity in that chaos. There\u2019s a team here coming together to save someone\u2019s life,\u201d the trailer for Code Black introduces ominously, while the video pans over a packed emergency room where the urgency is almost palpable.\n\nThe documentary covers the warzone-like chaos of the big L.A. emergency room throughout director Ryan McGarry and his classmates\u2019 residency training from 2008 to 2012. They begin by experiencing the high-paced trauma rooms where doctors work side-by-side in a crowded and blood strewn environment. Once they transition to their last year in the program, they move into a new facility where the new, modern health care practices bring them paperwork and disdain for the system.\n\n\u201cDuring Code Black it feels like the place is going to open up at the seams. I knew being a doctor anywhere else was not going to cut it,\u201d McGarry, who is now a physician at New York-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell, told the Daily News.\n\nL.A. County Hospital is one of the first places to treat emergency medicine as a specialty, which is why its trauma center, known as \u201cC-Booth\u201d is legendary. The name stands for \u201ccritical booth\u201d or \u201ccardiac booth\u201d and is where the sickest and dire patients were sent, making it a prime place for McGarry to show the rest of the country how both the emergency room doctors and patients are surviving the health care changeover in America.\n\n\"The story we're telling is obviously not exclusive to L.A.,\" McGarry told the Daily News. \"We could have told the story in any major city.\"\n\nWhen the film premiered last summer, it became the winner of Los Angeles Film Festival's \u201cBest Documentary,\u201d and the Hamptons International Film Festival\u2019s \u201cBest Documentary Feature,\u201d among others.\n\nEmergency room visits have increased and even though many more now have access to health insurance thanks to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamacare, many plans aren\u2019t premiums and cut people off from specialists. The doctors who are experiencing first hand what it\u2019s really like, are given a voice in Code Black.\n\n\u201cI've invested so much into this idea of the patient-doctor experience, and yet I'm the last one to really get to say how that experience is going to go,\u201d McGarry told NPR News. \u201cSo really, I think the answer is: Docs need to speak up. And I think partly, that's what Code Black was for me, personally \u2014 a chance to say, \u2018OK, this is the state of affairs. And I don't [think] that we feel like it's acceptable.\u2019\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "code, black, documentary, reveals, complicated, and, messy, truth, behind, la, hospital, crisis", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A new documentary brings cameras into the busiest ER in America and shows the truth behind the health care crisis complication.", "title": "\u2018Code Black\u2019: Documentary Reveals Truth Behind America\u2019s Busiest ER [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/code-black-documentary-reveals-complicated-and-messy-truth-behind-la-hospital-crisis-289534", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/23/code-black-documentary-directed-doctors-gives-voice-health-care.JPG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A new documentary brings cameras into the busiest ER in America and shows the truth behind the health care crisis complication.", "title": "\u2018Code Black\u2019: Documentary Reveals Truth Behind America\u2019s Busiest ER [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/code-black-documentary-reveals-complicated-and-messy-truth-behind-la-hospital-crisis-289534", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/23/code-black-documentary-directed-doctors-gives-voice-health-care.JPG", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/23/code-black-documentary-directed-doctors-gives-voice-health-care.JPG"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Policy/Biz", "published_time": "2014-06-23T18:47:40-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-23T18:47:39-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A new documentary brings cameras into the busiest ER in America and shows the truth behind the health care crisis complication."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc9be\"", "article_summary": "And I think partly, that's what Code Black was for me, personally \u2014 a chance to say, \u2018OK, this is the state of affairs.\n\u201cDuring Code Black it feels like the place is going to open up at the seams.\n\"The story we're telling is obviously not exclusive to L.A.,\" McGarry told the Daily News.\nThe doctors who are experiencing first hand what it\u2019s really like, are given a voice in Code Black.\nCode Black is set to release June 27 and provides viewers with the inner workings of America\u2019s busiest emergency room, and how it copes with the system in place."}
