The victims included a French national, an Indian, four other foreigners and Nepalese guides, hotel owners, workers and porters.\n\nThe main runway was temporarily closed to big planes because of damage. It was built to handle only medium-size jetliners, but not the large military and cargo planes that have been flying in aid supplies, food, medicines, and rescue and humanitarian workers, said Birendra Shrestha, the manager of Tribhuwan International Airport, located on the outskirts of Kathmandu.\n\nThere have been reports of cracks on the runway and other problems at the only airport capable of handling jetliners.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got one runway, and you\u2019ve got limited handling facilities, and you\u2019ve got the ongoing commercial flights,\u201d said Jamie McGoldrick, the U.N. coordinator for Nepal. \u201cYou put on top of that massive relief items coming in, the search and rescue teams that has clogged up this airport. And I think once they put better systems in place, I think that will get better.\u201d\n\nHe said the bottlenecks in aid delivery were slowly disappearing, and the Nepalese government eased customs and other bureaucratic hurdles on humanitarian aid following complaints from the U.N.\n\n\u201cThe government has taken note of some of the concerns that we\u2019ve expressed to them,\u201d he said.\n\nKai Tabacek, a spokesman for the British charity Oxfam, said the main problem was that Kathmandu airport was too small \u201cto deal with huge volume of traffic. Of course, there have been some delays, but these have more to do with the challenge of moving large volumes of goods than customs.\u201d\n\nAirport congestion was only the latest complication in the global effort to aid people in the wake of the April 25 quake, the impoverished country\u2019s biggest and most destructive in eight decades. Nepal\u2019s geography of high mountains and difficult road networks \u201cis always going to be a challenge,\u201d McGoldrick said. Airlifting goods by helicopter \u201cright now is quite limited,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Nepal shuts airport to big jets; more bodies found", "title": "Nepal shuts airport to big jets; more bodies found", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Nepal shuts airport to big jets; more bodies found", "title": "Nepal shuts airport to big jets; more bodies found", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/05/03/nepal_shuts_airport_to_big_jets_more_bodies_found/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/nepal-earthquake.jpeg33-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Nepal shuts airport to big jets; more bodies found", "title": "Nepal shuts airport to big jets; more bodies found", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/nepal-earthquake.jpeg33-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Binaj Gurubacharya", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcabdb\"", "article_summary": "The main runway was temporarily closed to big planes because of damage.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got one runway, and you\u2019ve got limited handling facilities, and you\u2019ve got the ongoing commercial flights,\u201d said Jamie McGoldrick, the U.N. coordinator for Nepal.\nThere have been reports of cracks on the runway and other problems at the only airport capable of handling jetliners.\n\u201cYou put on top of that massive relief items coming in, the search and rescue teams that has clogged up this airport.\nThe victims included a French national, an Indian, four other foreigners and Nepalese guides, hotel owners, workers and porters."}
