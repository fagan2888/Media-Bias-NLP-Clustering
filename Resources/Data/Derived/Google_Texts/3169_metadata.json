(Photo: Photos by Mark Moran / Weird NJ)\n\nFor many many, years motorists traveling along Route 40 in the Mizpah area, between Buena Vista and Mays Landing, were treated to the sight of a work of art comprised of meticulously arranged multicolored milk jugs. Using food and fabric dyes as her medium, one-gallon plastic jugs as her palette, and her yard as a canvas, lawn artist Josephine Stapleton worked on her Technicolor masterpiece for more than 30 years.\n\nThe display changed seasonally in celebration of the different holidays. Josephine paid homage to Easter, Halloween and Christmas, and even had a Disney themed Mickey and Minnie Mouse design which included a vibrant full spectrum rainbow. (Better watch out for those copyright lawyers Josephine!).\n\nJosephine even crafted a life-sized self-portrait of sorts out of milk jugs that she named Jug-a-bell. The figure wore a brightly colored housecoat, wig, hat and glasses, and hung beneath the eaves outside the front door of Josephine\u2019s house.\n\nThis 2002 photo displays the milk jug flafg (Photo: Photos by Mark Moran / Weird NJ)\n\nOriginally designed to keep her kids off the lawn, the piece attracted art enthusiasts from all over the country. Visitors often donated their used jugs to support jug display, which was much appreciated by Josephine, who ironically was lactose intolerant and not able to stomach milk. She hoped to one day build a map of the entire United States out of jugs, with each state being represented by a jug from its home state.\n\nThe longest running motif of this front yard gallery was the enormous red, white and blue American flag, which was part of Josephine\u2019s permanent collection. We asked her why the flag had remained such a constant fixture in the lawn design, while her other creations were always in a state of flux.\n\n\u201cThose jugs are so old,\u201d she told us, \u201cthat if I tried to move them they\u2019d fall apart!\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, the flag had been desecrated in the past by 4-wheeling lawn jockeys doing a little off-roading across Josephine\u2019s lawn. It seems some people just have no respect for the flag, or the arts!\n\nIn this 2002 photo, Josephine Stapleton stands next to her Jug-a-Bell.

This past week we received the following message from Josephine\u2019s niece Lee Ann Farrell:\n\n\u201cDear Weird NJ \u2013 My aunt, Josephine Stapleton, the Milk Jug Lady of Mays Landing, NJ, is still around though she is now battling a serious illness. She wanted me to reach out to you and all of her followers that had stopped by at one point or another to see her milk jug creations. Thank you for highlighting her work. It was a labor of love and she misses it dearly.\u201d\n\nThose who would like to offer well wishes to Josephine, a truly unique fixture of our New Jersey culture, may post their comments at the Weird NJ web site (www.WeirdNJ.com) and we will be sure to pass them on to the Milk Jug Lady.\n\nWeird NJ magazine, \u201cYour Travel Guide to New Jersey\u2019s Local Legends and Best Kept Secrets,\u201d is available on newsstands throughout the state and on the web at www.WeirdNJ.com.\n\nDon't miss a thing Download our apps and get alerts for local news, weather, traffic and more.
