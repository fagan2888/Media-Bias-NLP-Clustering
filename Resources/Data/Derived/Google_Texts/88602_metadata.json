Offensive coordinator Ben McAdoo can have some, too, and so can defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo, whose group gave up touchdowns on Dallas\u2019 final two drives in a 27-26 loss on Sunday night.\n\nManning was the focus of the blame Monday.\n\nAfter losing track of Dallas\u2019 timeouts, the 12-year veteran says \u2014 on his own \u2014 he told Jennings not to score on two consecutive plays when the Giants had a first down at the Cowboys 4-yard line with 1:54 to play, and 23-20 lead.\n\n\u201cI thought that they may let us score to get the ball back, so that\u2019s why I informed Rashad if they let you score, just go down at the one-inch line. Don\u2019t score,\u201d Manning said. \u201cHe still ran hard, we got two yards on first down and second down, third down that was my_it\u2019s still my mistake. That did not come from the sideline.\u201d\n\nManning believed Dallas had one timeout remaining when it had two. The problem was Manning didn\u2019t realize Dallas did not use a time out with 1:54 when the Giants declined a penalty after a first-down pass to Odell Beckham Jr.\n\nIn the final five minutes, NFL rules mandate that the game clock starts on the snap after all out of bounds plays and after all penalty enforcements. That allowed Dallas to use its final two time outs after runs of 2 and 1-yard by Jennings.\n\nTo compound the problem, Manning threw the ball away and stopped the clock against on a third-down pass. He should have taken a sack and milked the clock.\n\nManning talked to the offense Monday and acknowledged the mistakes.\n\n\u201cReally the third-down decision is what bothers me more than anything,\u201d he said. \u201cI think not making the better decision right there and taking that sack. That would\u2019ve made a bigger difference than anything.\u201d\n\nCoughlin said he was unaware that Manning told Jennings not to score. He wanted a touchdown.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s all I ever wanted_was to get back to the 10 point lead,\u201d Coughlin said. \u201cDallas has had success driving the ball late in the game against us for a couple years, and scoring late touchdowns to defeat us. By going up 10, that would not have been an issue.\u201d\n\nThere were other problems. Before the third-down pass play call, none of the coaches told Manning to take a sack if the play was not open.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got to be smarter in that scenario and understand that the clock is the most important thing there and that we weren\u2019t going to go for it on fourth down,\u201d Manning said. \u201cSo that\u2019s bad management of the game in that scenario and understanding how important the clock was right there.\u201d\n\nJosh Brown\u2019s field goal gave the Giants a 26-20 lead with 1:34 left, but Tony Romo drove the Cowboys to a winning touchdown with seven seconds left.\n\nThe loss was a brutal one for a team that was looking for a big start after missing the playoffs the last three seasons.\n\n\u201cIt hurts but it\u2019s supposed to hurt when you play your tails off and you work hard and you do a lot of good things and don\u2019t come out on top, it hurts,\u201d Manning said.\n\nDefensive lineman Cullen Jenkins said the loss was one of the most devastating of his 12-year career, noting teammates and coaches tried to pick him up Monday. He added former Giant Michael Strahan talked to the team and that helped.\n\n\u201cYou go out there and you fight, we fight as hard as we did, and we put ourselves in position, and we just couldn\u2019t close it out and finish it,\u201d Jenkins said.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Eli Manning admits mistake in telling Rashad Jennings not to score late", "title": "Eli Manning admits mistake in telling Rashad Jennings not to score late", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/09/14/eli-manning-admits-mistake-in-telling-rashad-jennings-not-to-score-late/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150914_060903_rashad-jennings.jpg", "height": 472}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150914_060903_rashad-jennings.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-14T18:08:49+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-21T21:26:28+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "That would\u2019ve made a bigger difference than anything.\u201dCoughlin said he was unaware that Manning told Jennings not to score.\nBefore the third-down pass play call, none of the coaches told Manning to take a sack if the play was not open.\nDon\u2019t score,\u201d Manning said.\nTo compound the problem, Manning threw the ball away and stopped the clock against on a third-down pass.\nEAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. \u2014 Eli Manning is taking the blame for two late blunders that led to the New York Giants\u2019 collapse against the Dallas Cowboys, including one where he told halfback Rashad Jennings not to score."}
