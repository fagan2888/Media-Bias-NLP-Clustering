It\u2019s not entirely clear whether Geraghty thinks it\u2019s \u201cunfair\u201d to oppose the bailout, to call it that, or both. Regardless, Obamacare is poised to force taxpayers to help cover health insurers\u2019 losses \u2014 and it\u2019s harder to imagine a clearer example of a bailout, or of cronyism, than that.\n\nGeraghty claims that we should have sympathy for health insurance companies because the Obama administration\u2019s rollout of healthcare.gov was so inept, and because President Obama has refused to implement Obamacare as written.\n\nThe Post writes,\n\n\u201c[I]nsurers including Florida Blue have had to adapt to a number of big changes after they filed rates, Geraghty said. For example, Obama decreed people who liked their old policies could keep them [after Obamacare had banned them], affecting 300,000 Florida Blue customers. That changed the risk assumptions on which prices were set.\n\n\u201c\u2018Our price before we got to Day 1 was insufficient,\u2019 Geraghty said. \u2018That\u2019s what we call a nightmare.\u2019\n\n\u201cThen problems with the federal health care website turned an expected 50,000 calls per week to Florida Blue to five times that, he said. The enrollment period started \u2018with multiple disasters,\u2019 Geraghty said.\u201d\n\nFair enough: Obamacare is a disaster, and Obama\u2019s execution of it is a lawless disaster. Still, it isn\u2019t remotely clear why taxpayers should have to bail out insurance companies as a result.\n\nPlus, when it comes to Obamacare, Geraghty \u2014 like so many other insurance execs \u2014 hasn\u2019t exactly been an innocent bystander. As the House Oversight Committee recently learned and documented, White House communications director Tara McGuiness and Chris Jennings, Obama\u2019s deputy assistant for health policy, collaborated with \u201cnumerous insurance company CEOs\u201d to try to sell Obamacare to a citizenry that rightly wanted nothing to do with it. Prominently listed among these CEOs \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 was Geraghty.\n\nThe Oversight Committee\u2019s report reads, \u201cMs. McGuiness and Mr. Jennings collaborated closely with Florida Blue Cross and Blue Shield CEO Patrick Geraghty. After a CBS Evening News appearance on October 11, 2013, Ms. McGuiness emailed Mr. Geraghty, \u2018You were great! I watched. Thanks for the help.\u2019\u201d\n\nTwelve days later, Geraghty and the respective CEOs of Aetna, Humana, the Health Care Services Corporation, Centene Corp., Wellpoint, Kaiser Permanente, Tufts Health, Health Net, CareFirst, the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, and America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans (AHIP) all met with Jarrett and Obama chief of staff Denis McDonough at the White House.\n\nA few days after that, Jennings emailed Geraghty before an appearance on Meet the Press, writing, \u201cPat: Tara McGuiness will probably reach out to you directly today to give you latest info and suggestions for press prep. Please advise if you need anything from me. I may call you later to make sure all is ok. Thanks so much for all.\u201d Both McGuiness and Jennings then followed up with specific advice. After Geraghty\u2019s appearance aired, Jennings emailed him and said, \u201cPat: You were extraordinary. \u2026 We were all impressed. Thank you so much! Would like to talk soon.\u201d\n\nAmerican voters aren\u2019t so likely to be impressed with Geraghty or this cozy alliance between Big Government and Big Insurers. They certainly won\u2019t be impressed when they learn that they\u2019re about to have to bail those insurers out. But that\u2019s what set to happen: A survey conducted by the Oversight Committee found that 80 percent of insurance companies (12 out of 15) expect to be bailed out this year.\n\nIn light of all this, it might seem surprising that House Republicans have yet to vote to stop the Obamacare insurer bailout \u2014 and time is running out for them to do so before the midterm election. Such a vote would be a blow to Obamacare, a defeat for corporate welfare and cronyism, and would provide a solid rebuttal to the Democrats\u2019 claim that the GOP just wants \u201cto put insurance companies back in charge of Americans\u2019 health care.\u201d Moreover, it would force Harry Reid and vulnerable Senate Democrats to explain why they won\u2019t stop a bailout that Americans oppose by the tally of 81 to 10 percent.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Bailout,Health Care,insurance,Jeffrey H.
