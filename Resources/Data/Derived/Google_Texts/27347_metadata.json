Cruz takes the current president to task on a simple theme: the rule of law.\n\nRule of law doesn\u2019t simply mean that society has laws; dictatorships are often characterized by an abundance of laws. Rather, rule of law means that we are a nation ruled by laws, not men. That no one\u2014and especially not the president\u2014is above the law. For that reason, the U.S. Constitution imposes on every president the express duty to \u201ctake Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.\u201d Yet rather than honor this duty, President Obama has openly defied it by repeatedly suspending, delaying and waiving portions of the laws he is charged to enforce.\n\n\n\nThe rule of law is so deeply engrained in Western civilization that we hardly notice it. Over 800 years ago, the rule of law was formally recognized in the Magna Carta, with the revolutionary idea that law could prevail over the will of a king. The Founding Fathers of the United States (knowing full well the tyranny of a king) recognized that a suitable government is one of \u201claws, not men,\u201d as John Adams said.\n\nAnd it is this disregard for the rule of law on the part of Obama that Cruz finds deeply problematic. The president has openly declared he has no reason nor willingness to follow the law of the land when it impinges upon his will:\n\nAs he said recently, describing his executive powers: \u201cI\u2019ve got a pen, and I\u2019ve got a phone.\u201d Under the Constitution, that is not the way federal law is supposed to work. The Obama administration has been so brazen in its attempts to expand federal power that the Supreme Court has unanimously rejected the Justice Department\u2019s efforts to expand federal power nine times since January 2012. There is no example of lawlessness more egregious than the enforcement\u2014or nonenforcement\u2014of the president\u2019s signature policy, the Affordable Care Act. Mr. Obama has repeatedly declared that \u201cit\u2019s the law of the land.\u201d Yet he has repeatedly violated ObamaCare\u2019s statutory text. The law says that businesses with 50 or more full-time employees will face the employer mandate on Jan. 1, 2014. President Obama changed that, granting a one-year waiver to employers. How did he do so? Not by going to Congress to change the text of the law, but through a blog post by an assistant secretary at Treasury announcing the change.\n\nNo one at Rummymede or in in the Assembly Room of the Pennsylvania State House could possibly have imagined law by blog post \u2013 yet here we are. Cruz rightly points out that this type of disregard for the rule of law (which destroys economies, communities, nations) is not a partisan issue. It is, as a matter of fact, the very essence of our nation and our governance. Cruz ends his discussion with a scathing indictment:\n\nToday many in Congress\u2014and the press\u2014have chosen to give President Obama a pass on his pattern of lawlessness, perhaps letting partisan loyalty to the man supersede their fidelity to the law. But this should not be a partisan issue. In time, the country will have another president from another party. For all those who are silent now: What would they think of a Republican president who announced that he was going to ignore the law, or unilaterally change the law? Imagine a future president setting aside environmental laws, or tax laws, or labor laws, or tort laws with which he or she disagreed. That would be wrong\u2014and it is the Obama precedent that is opening the door for future lawlessness. As Montesquieu knew, an imperial presidency threatens the liberty of every citizen. Because when a president can pick and choose which laws to follow and which to ignore, he is no longer a president.\n\nRead \u201cTed Cruz: The Imperial Presidency of Barack Obama\u201d at The Wall Street Journal.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In today's Wall Street Journal, Senator Ted Cruz (R.- Texas) discusses the presidency of Barack Obama, on the heels of the president's State of the Union a", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.1", "og": {"site_name": "Acton Institute PowerBlog", "description": "In today's Wall Street Journal, Senator Ted Cruz (R.- Texas) discusses the presidency of Barack Obama, on the heels of the president's State of the Union a", "title": "The Presidency And The Rule Of Law | Acton PowerBlog", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://blog.acton.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/constitution-300x164.jpg", "url": "http://blog.acton.org/archives/65168-presidency-rule-law.html", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Acton Institute PowerBlog", "description": "In today's Wall Street Journal, Senator Ted Cruz (R.- Texas) discusses the presidency of Barack Obama, on the heels of the president's State of the Union a", "title": "The Presidency And The Rule Of Law | Acton PowerBlog", "image": "http://blog.acton.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/constitution-300x164.jpg", "creator": "@EliseJGHilton", "site": "@actoninstitute", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 22411840}, "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/actoninstitute", "section": "Political Culture", "tag": "wall street journal", "published_time": "2014-01-29T14:42:37+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; minimum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=0;"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9ce2\"", "article_summary": "Over 800 years ago, the rule of law was formally recognized in the Magna Carta, with the revolutionary idea that law could prevail over the will of a king.\nRule of law doesn\u2019t simply mean that society has laws; dictatorships are often characterized by an abundance of laws.\nAnd it is this disregard for the rule of law on the part of Obama that Cruz finds deeply problematic.\nRather, rule of law means that we are a nation ruled by laws, not men.\nCruz takes the current president to task on a simple theme: the rule of law."}
