Talk-show host and comedian Jimmy Fallon brought “Late Night” back to New York City, and Mayor Michael Bloomberg expressed his gratitude to the funny man, crashing his weekly thank-you note writing session Friday night.

During the “Thank You Notes” segment on “Late Night with Jimmy Fallon,” the talk-show host got a little visit from departing New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Cuing their thank-you note writing music, two combined their annual thank-you fest to save some time, and of course, hilarity ensued.

“Thank you large sodas,” Bloomberg said, winding up his writing arm in a Fallon-esque way, “for not taking it personally.”

While Fallon kept his thank you’s to New York City, Bloomberg had a little jab for New Jersey.

“Thank you, Statue of Liberty,” the outgoing mayor wrote, “for always lighting the way to freedom, truth and yes, even New Jersey.”

As Fallon expressed his gratitude for the Mayor himself, commending him for choosing to become mayor instead of Batman and for not being Toronto Mayor Rob Ford, Bloomberg shifted his thanks to Jay-Z for “letting me tell people we’re friends.”

Bloomberg will retire his post as New York City mayor at the end of the year, passing the torch on to Democrat Bill de Blasio.
