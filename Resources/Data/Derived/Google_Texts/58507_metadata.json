Only 10,000 small businesses have purchased insurance through the exchange and just 13 percent expressed interest in doing so.\n\nAccording to NFID, the law\u2019s heath insurance tax is one of the factors driving up prices.\n\n\u201cThe health insurance tax is assessed to health insurance companies and is then passed on to consumers of fully-funded insurance plans through higher premiums, plans that most small business owners purchase for themselves and their employees,\u201d the survey concludes. \u201cThe tax increased from $8 billion in 2014 to $11.3 billion in 2015.\u201d\n\nA study by the Brookings Institute found regulatory incentives and exemptions put in place by the ACA will take their toll on companies with less than 100 employees.\n\n\u201cWhile a big company usually has a diversified employee base and financial resources that can help absorb substantial overruns in health care expenses, a small company has neither,\u201d the study said. \u201cOne big claim can wipe out a small company.\u201d\n\nFollow Juliegrace Brufke on Twitter\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
