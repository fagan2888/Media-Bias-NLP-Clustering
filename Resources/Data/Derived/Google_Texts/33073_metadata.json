By placing the company into receivership, the commission would effectively take over the company and liquidate its assets to pay the deficit. It was the first time a health insurance company had been placed in receivership in Utah in more than 20 years.\n\nClosing Arches was a last resort after federal funding promises fell through and other fundraising options came up short, says Utah State Insurance Commissioner Todd Kiser.\n\n\u201cArches would be standing behind an $80 million bill from the federal government [for the loan initially taken out when Arches was being formed],\u201d he says. \u201cIt was possible for them to raise money, but anyone who would offer money to them would be standing behind this big note to the federal government. So although Arches tried to do that in the waning minutes of our negotiation, they were unable to do it.\u201d\n\nRisk corridor\n\nTo understand what happened to Arches requires understanding lesser-known pockets of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). In 2010, with the passing of the ACA, a space was created for member-owned nonprofit health insurance providers, a move designed to provide lower-cost insurance options for people who couldn\u2019t necessarily afford or might not qualify for traditional insurance policies, as well as to prompt big insurance companies to lower their premiums. All participating insurance entities\u2014nonprofits and the big guys alike\u2014were to pay into a fund dubbed the \u201crisk corridor\u201d that would help pay the bills lower premiums wouldn\u2019t cover.\n\nTwenty-three companies in 23 states applied for licenses to start these nonprofit, co-op insurance companies, including Arches in Utah.\n\n\u201cThey wanted to incentivize anybody, not just the co-ops, to have lower premiums, so they said if you have low premiums and high claims, you can submit claim money through the risk corridor and we will pay you for your claims,\u201d Kiser says. \u201cSo that was the motivator for people to have low premiums for the population.\u201d\n\nArches, the first new health plan in Utah since 1995, broke into the market in 2013. Although it started out at a disadvantage from big insurance companies\u2014existing insurance companies already had a body of policyholders, many of whom took President Barak Obama up on his offer that people could keep their old health plans even amidst the launching of ACA options\u2014it quickly gained a sturdy base of customers for its January 2014 coverage.\n\nIts premiums were low, as were its requirements for coverage. As a result, Kiser says, many of Arches\u2019 new policyholders were people for whom insurance had previously been out of reach, whether from pre-existing conditions (a barrier done away with in the ACA) or a suspicion of serious medical conditions that would have caused other insurance bills to skyrocket. A diagnosis of cancer, for example, could cost an insurance company $500,000 a year for a single patient, Kiser says. This \u201cadverse selection,\u201d as it is called in the industry, of a higher percentage of higher-cost patients was covered by the risk corridor, though it would ultimately contribute to Arches\u2019 demise.\n\nPremium pressures\n\nBy law, insurance companies must submit their policy costs by a certain date each year to the insurance commission, which keeps all of the information from all of the companies to its chest until after the deadline, after which it makes the information public all at once. Kiser says this makes companies set their own prices based on their own projected costs, rather than trying to battle it out with another company for the lowest premium price.\n\nThe ACA and risk corridor did encourage insurance companies to lower their prices, but Arches was still the lowest when it came on the scene. The following year, Kiser says, other insurance companies had lowered their policy prices further in an attempt to compete with Arches\u2019 numbers.\n\nKiser says Arches itself was planning on raising its rock-bottom rates by about 40 percent, losing some of its poorest customers, in an attempt to protect itself from some of its higher claims.\n\n\u201cTheir marketing strategy was changing. They didn\u2019t want this unhealthy group so they were pricing them out,\u201d Kiser says. \u201cThey clearly had felt some adverse selection \u2026 but still, had that risk corridor money come through, that may have given them a brighter future with that business strategy that was changing. Unfortunately, they got caught in this situation where claims were much stronger than capital and failure of risk corridor money put them in a position of not enough money to pay those claims.\u201d\n\nPolicy pricing is still something that is in flux, Kiser says, although the ACA was supposed to stabilize it. Part of the problem with determining policy prices stemmed from a seemingly unending string of regulation changes from the federal government. A change in legislative ideology also made it more difficult to pin down policy prices.\n\n\u201cIt was just too fluid. We were seeing regulations from the feds coming pretty frequently, at least monthly. You have one Congress who liked it and the next Congress who didn\u2019t like it\u2014it was very challenging for insurance companies across the nation, including Utah, to determine rating. We have a healthy, strong health insurance market. But insurance companies have still not figured out where they need to be pricing with all the challenges to figure out, and it\u2019s going to be another couple years, I\u2019m sure, before we see pricing stabilize.\u201d\n\nA crippling blow\n\nThe election of a more conservative Congress in 2014 would prove to be a crippling blow to co-op insurance companies. The passing of the Balanced Budget Act required in part that the risk corridor be revenue neutral, meaning the risk corridor would have to rely only on the funds being put into it by the companies with no federal funding assistance.\n\nIn 2015, $2.4 billion in bills were submitted to the risk corridor, but only $362 million was collected from companies\u2014only enough to fill 12.5 percent of the claims, Kiser says. Arches submitted $10 million in claims, but only received a little over $1 million, he says.\n\n\u201cWe were held by federal law to tell companies you\u2019re tied in with this [risk corridor system], even though you\u2019re not going to get that money,\u201d Kiser says, noting that even through the fall, companies and the commission were being told that funding would be found through other avenues. \u201cThey continued to be very optimistic, leading companies and co-ops to believe they would get this funding.\u201d\n\nArches wasn\u2019t the only one in trouble\u2014of the 23 original co-ops nationwide, 11 had already folded, eight of which closed after the announcement that the risk corridor would be revenue neutral. Kiser says when it became clear that Arches was in trouble, after it had burned through too much of its funding reserves, it tried to see if it could get more money from the pot that now had fewer companies drawing from it.\n\n\u201cWe tried to make it work. We negotiated with [Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services] to see if we could get concessions made, additional money. We thought, well, if all these other companies have already announced [their closing], maybe there\u2019s additional money available that could be supplanted and given to Utah,\u201d he says. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t. Their hands were tied. They had 12 other states, I guess.\u201d\n\nWith no other options, Kiser says, the commission legally had to place Arches in receivership. Individual plans ran out on Dec. 31, 2015 while some group plans will carry on until the end of October 2016. However, he says, the commission is taking all steps to ensure claims will be paid and none of the policyholders suffer as a result of the failure.\n\n\u201cWe are optimistic that we will have a soft landing,\u201d he says. \u201cWe hope there are adequate assets to pay off the claims and create a very soft landing, as opposed to just falling on the concrete.\u201d\n\nCalls and emails to Arches administration have not been returned. Kiser says workers and the previous administration of Arches\u2014the insurance commission is technically the owner of the company as part of the receivership\u2014have been discouraged from talking to the media.\n\nKiser says he believes Arches\u2019 closure stems mainly from three contributing factors: the failure of the risk corridor due to a lack of federal budget assistance, adverse selection of the marketplace and transitional policies, and inability to raise more capital like a large insurance company could because of its nature as a co-op. Those factors have also been responsible for the difficulty and failure many of the other co-ops have faced, he says, and the hindrance of the co-op system in general.\n\n\u201cIt was a wonderful dream,\u201d he says. \u201cI wish it would have worked. It just didn\u2019t.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "In late October, more than 60,000 Utahns got a sudden fright: Arches Health Plan was closing.", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "og": {"site_name": "Utah Business", "description": "In late October, more than 60,000 Utahns got a sudden fright: Arches Health Plan was closing.", "title": "Broken Arches: What happened to Utah\u2019s nonprofit insurance company - Utah Business", "url": "http://www.utahbusiness.com/broken-arches-happened-utahs-nonprofit-insurance-company/", "image": "http://www.utahbusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Focus-Arches.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-03-14T11:01:43+00:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.utahbusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Focus-Arches.jpg", "description": "In late October, more than 60,000 Utahns got a sudden fright: Arches Health Plan was closing.", "card": "summary", "title": "Broken Arches: What happened to Utah\u2019s nonprofit insurance company - Utah Business"}, "robots": "noodp", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.utahbusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/cropped-site_icon-270x270.png", "google-site-verification": "uwlXCNunRNHNZDbUXIluMCbQrbDYw1Iig7hWF56rLzY", "article": {"section": 2016, "tag": "Print Issue", "published_time": "2016-03-05T14:28:14+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-14T11:01:43+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Twenty-three companies in 23 states applied for licenses to start these nonprofit, co-op insurance companies, including Arches in Utah.\nIt was the first time a health insurance company had been placed in receivership in Utah in more than 20 years.\n\u201cThe Utah Insurance Department today announced that it will place Arches Health Plan in receivership,\u201d the department stated in a press release on Oct. 27.\nIn late October, more than 60,000 Utahns got a sudden fright: Arches Health Plan was closing.\nThe ACA and risk corridor did encourage insurance companies to lower their prices, but Arches was still the lowest when it came on the scene."}
