The appeal will be filed within two weeks, Reyes spokeswoman Missy Larsen said.\n\nReyes\u2019 chief of staff, Parker Douglas, said it is office policy to defend any law that is challenged for constitutionality so long as there is a defense. He said they aren\u2019t taking any political position, but rather seeking clarity so state residents know the reach of the state\u2019s polygamy law.\n\n\u201cIf the attorney general doesn\u2019t defend a law, he\u2019s just let the representatives of the people down by essentially vetoing it through non-defense,\u201d said Douglas, who oversees cases that go through federal courts.\n\nHe said they will use office attorneys on the appeal, meaning there will be no outside cost.\n\nWaddoups ruled a provision in Utah\u2019s bigamy law forbidding cohabitation with another person violated the First Amendment, which guarantees the freedom of religion.\n\nBrown family attorney Jonathan Turley wasn\u2019t immediate available for comment but previously said the family is prepared to take the legal fight to the U.S. Supreme Court if necessary.\n\nIn a blog post Wednesday, Turley argued that Utah should not challenge a ruling that reaffirmed freedom of religion and equal protection. \u201cUtah is a state that was founded by citizens seeking those very rights against government abuse,\u201d Turley wrote.\n\nThe Brown family filed their lawsuit in July 2011 and fled Utah for Las Vegas last year under the threat of prosecution.\n\nWaddoups\u2018 ruling decriminalized polygamy, but bigamy \u2014 holding marriage licenses with multiple partners \u2014 is still illegal. If the ruling stands, Utah\u2019s law would be identical to most other states that prohibit people from having multiple marriage licenses. In most polygamous families in Utah, the man is legally married to one woman but only \u201cspiritually married\u201d to the others.\n\nPolygamy is a legacy of the early teachings of the mainstream Mormon church, but the Salt Lake City-based Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints abandoned the practice in 1890 and strictly prohibits it today.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Utah's attorney general has decided to appeal a ruling that struck down parts of the state's anti-polygamy law in what marked a significant victory for the family on the reality TV show \"Sister Wives\" and polygamous families living in Utah.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Utah\u2019s attorney general has decided to appeal a ruling that struck down parts of the state\u2019s anti-polygamy law in what marked a significant victory for the family on the reality TV show \u201cSister Wives\u201d and polygamous families living in Utah.", "title": "Utah to appeal ruling in \u2018Sister Wives\u2019 case", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/sep/25/utah-to-appeal-ruling-in-sister-wives-case/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/09/25/cce416acc08fb825600f6a7067006669.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/09/25/cce416acc08fb825600f6a7067006669.jpg", "description": "Utah's attorney general has decided to appeal a ruling that struck down parts of the state's anti-polygamy law in what marked a significant victory for the family on the reality TV show \"Sister Wives\"", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Utah to appeal ruling in \u2018Sister Wives\u2019 case"}, "Author": "Brady McCombs", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Law Crime, Social Issues, Clark Waddoups, Salt Lake City, Sean Reyes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe09f5\"", "article_summary": "He said they aren\u2019t taking any political position, but rather seeking clarity so state residents know the reach of the state\u2019s polygamy law.\nThe ruling was made final about a month ago, and Attorney General Sean Reyes filed paperwork Wednesday saying Utah will appeal to the Denver-based 10th U.S.\nIf the ruling stands, Utah\u2019s law would be identical to most other states that prohibit people from having multiple marriage licenses.\nIn a blog post Wednesday, Turley argued that Utah should not challenge a ruling that reaffirmed freedom of religion and equal protection.\nSALT LAKE CITY \u2014 Utah\u2019s attorney general has decided to appeal a ruling that struck down parts of the state\u2019s anti-polygamy law in what marked a significant victory for the family on the reality TV show \u201cSister Wives\u201d and polygamous families living in Utah."}
