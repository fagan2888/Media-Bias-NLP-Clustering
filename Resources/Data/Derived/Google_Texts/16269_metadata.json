The Colorado electorate is divided almost exactly into one-third Republican, one-third Democratic and one-third neither of the above. So conservative and liberal proposals alike are pushed in the Legislature and put before voters; discussion isn\u2019t proscribed by the one-party dominance that you find in a red or blue state.\n\n\u201cWe really duke things out,\u201d said Chris Onan, a co-founder of Galvanize, a firm here that provides seed funds, office space and other support for tech start-ups. \u201cThere\u2019s never just one position.\u201d\n\nEven the state\u2019s weather is in flux and in extremis. Colorado is a meteorological drama queen, and the sorts of cataclysms that climate change could bring \u2014 raging wildfires, biblical flooding \u2014 have recurred here with scary frequency.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost Old Testament,\u201d said Hickenlooper. \u201cWe had 13 federal declarations of disaster in four years. I think that\u2019s more than any other state in the history of the country.\u201d\n\nHickenlooper, a Democrat, is also up for re-election. And his race, against Bob Beauprez, a former Congressman, has been tighter than political analysts had initially expected it to be.\n\nBut an even more interesting contest is the one in the state\u2019s Sixth Congressional District, where the efforts of a three-term Republican incumbent, Mike Coffman, to fend off a fierce Democratic challenge will hinge largely on his ability to woo Latino voters. Their share of the electorate here, as in the nation, has risen significantly, and they now represent roughly 20 percent of the state\u2019s population. In recent Colorado elections, they have heavily favored Democrats.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cFor its predictive value in seeing where the Hispanic vote nationally is going to go, the Sixth District could be key,\u201d Eric Anderson, a political analyst here, told me. It\u2019s \u201ca petri dish inside the petri dish\u201d of the state, he added.\n\nPhoto\n\nAlthough Coffman previously supported measures to declare English the official U.S. language and to deny automatic citizenship to babies born in this country, he\u2019s not singing those songs anymore. No, he\u2019s practicing his Spanish, in weekly sessions with a tutor. His Democratic challenger, Andrew Romanoff, is fluent.\n\nMoney from outside the state is pouring into the Coffman-Romanoff battle, as it is into the one between Udall and Gardner, which is clearly going to be the most expensive Senate race in Colorado\u2019s history. And the Latino vote could give Udall the edge he needs.\n\nBut the Udall campaign\u2019s emphasis until this point is in line with a Democratic strategy nationwide for the midterm elections. In three of the six TV commercials that it has released, the focus is on Gardner\u2019s anti-abortion record, and the hope is to cast him as a dutiful and menacing foot soldier in the \u201cwar on women\u201d that Democrats decry.\n\nUdall\u2019s campaign also reflects the Democratic dread of Obama\u2019s unpopularity. When the president traveled to Colorado recently for a fund-raiser for Udall, there was no hug or handshake between the two men, and a photo of both of them would have required a very wide-angle lens. Udall stayed far outside the state.\n\nGardner\u2019s strategy, evident in his constant invocations of Obamacare, is to lash Udall to the president and to tar the Obama administration as a force for ever bigger government.\n\nWHEN I asked Udall\u2019s campaign spokesman, Chris Harris, how much of a handicap Obama posed, he didn\u2019t defend the president\u2019s record but instead stressed Udall\u2019s independence and dissents.\n\n\u201cIf any Democrat has been a pain in the White House\u2019s you-know-what lately, it has been Mark,\u201d he said, making clear that Udall \u201cfollows his own compass\u201d and had held the administration\u2019s \u201cfeet to the fire over the N.S.A.\u201d That detail suggested Democrats\u2019 worry that the National Security Agency\u2019s privacy infringements are especially repellent to the party\u2019s young voters.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIt\u2019s surprising that Udall and Hickenlooper aren\u2019t in better shape, given that Colorado\u2019s unemployment rate has fallen to 5.5 percent from over 9 in late 2010. Business Insider just ranked Colorado\u2019s economy the best among the 50 states.\n\nBut Colorado distills the national mood in the following sense, too: While raw numbers have improved, reality hasn\u2019t caught up, and people feel a pessimism that transcends the day\u2019s statistics. In a statewide poll in late June, only 27 percent of Coloradans said the country was on the right track, while 65 percent said it was on the wrong one.\n\nColorado has shown us the horror of gun violence: the blood bath at Columbine High School in 1999, the massacre in Aurora in 2012. And in their aftermath, it demonstrated the push for \u2014 and perverse resistance to \u2014 better gun control. Its legislature enacted new firearms restrictions in early 2013, only to see the National Rifle Association lead successful recall efforts against two of the Democrats who voted for them.\n\nBecause Colorado is a mecca for both energy companies and wilderness lovers, it\u2019s been engaged in an impassioned debate over fracking that\u2019s both echo and preview of standoffs elsewhere.\n\nHickenlooper, a former geologist trying to walk a fine line between the camps, once exhibited his conviction in the safety of fracking by drinking fracking fluid. Colorado likes unstuffy politicians who break the mold, which is something candidates with national ambitions increasingly try to do.\n\nOver the last month, Hickenlooper has taken the stage at Red Rocks to play banjo with the Old Crow Medicine Show and has released a video of his attempt to sing a duet of \u201cCounting Stars\u201d with OneRepublic\u2019s Ryan Tedder. It was offbeat and off key.\n\nAnd Udall gazed longingly at the peaks, hoping to find time for an ascent. \u201cHe\u2019s climbed 99 of the tallest 100 mountains in Colorado,\u201d said Harris. \u201cThat\u2019s who he is.\u201d Harris made him sound like a man eager to get far away from the political muck.\n\nIt\u2019s an impulse that most Americans can appreciate. And that they share.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "opinion", "ptime": 20140816144558, "twitter": {"description": "With several tight, emblematic races, Colorado is a major 2014 player.", "creator": "FrankBruni", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/17/opinion/sunday/frank-bruni-a-battleground-and-bellwether.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003059011"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "title": "A Battleground and Bellwether", "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/06/24/opinion/Bruni_new/Bruni_new-thumbLarge-v2.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/17/opinion/sunday/frank-bruni-a-battleground-and-bellwether.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003059011", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/17/opinion/sunday/frank-bruni-a-battleground-and-bellwether.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion/sunday", "channels": "NytNow", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Aug. 16, 2014", "edt": "NewYork", "keywords": "Colorado,Udall  Mark,Hickenlooper  John W,Gardner  Cory S,Politics and Government,Midterm Elections (2014)", "description": "With several tight, emblematic races, Colorado is a major 2014 player.", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Frank Bruni", "SCG": "sunday", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "per": "Gardner, Cory S", "slug": "17bruni", "byl": "By FRANK BRUNI", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "With several tight, emblematic races, Colorado is a major 2014 player.", "tom": "Op-Ed", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "utime": 20141107180119, "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/06/24/opinion/Bruni_new/Bruni_new-thumbStandard-v3.jpg", "news_keywords": "Colorado", "CN": "frank-bruni", "CG": "opinion", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Aug. 16, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "Op-Ed", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/b/frank_bruni/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "modified": "2014-11-07", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Midterm Elections (2014)", "published": "2014-08-16", "section-taxonomy-id": "AD8090D7-4137-4D71-84C8-70DA3BD89778"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "geo": "Colorado", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "CT": "column", "hdl_p": "A Battleground and Bellwether", "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/17/opinion/sunday/frank-bruni-a-battleground-and-bellwether.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/06/24/opinion/Bruni_new/Bruni_new-videoSixteenByNine600.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "With several tight, emblematic races, Colorado is a major 2014 player.", "title": "A Battleground and Bellwether"}, "pdate": 20140816, "des": "Midterm Elections (2014)", "nyt-collection": {"tone": "opinion", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/column/frank-bruni", "tagline": "Politics, social issues, education and culture.", "uri": "/column/frank-bruni", "display-name": "Frank Bruni", "identifier": "frank-bruni", "type": "column"}, "col": "Op-Ed Columnist", "articleid": 100000003059011, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "A Battleground and Bellwether", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/06/24/opinion/Bruni_new/Bruni_new-thumbLarge-v2.jpg", "PST": "Op-Ed"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca32c\"", "article_summary": "The Colorado electorate is divided almost exactly into one-third Republican, one-third Democratic and one-third neither of the above.\n\u201cThat\u2019s who he is.\u201d Harris made him sound like a man eager to get far away from the political muck.\nI think that\u2019s more than any other state in the history of the country.\u201dHickenlooper, a Democrat, is also up for re-election.\nBut the Udall campaign\u2019s emphasis until this point is in line with a Democratic strategy nationwide for the midterm elections.\nAnd his race, against Bob Beauprez, a former Congressman, has been tighter than political analysts had initially expected it to be."}
