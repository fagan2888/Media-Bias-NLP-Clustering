The article focuses on drugs commonly known as \u201cmorning-after\u201d pills, which actually can be used to stop pregnancy for up to three to five days after unprotected sex.\n\nRovner\u2019s argument consists of two major points: the first is that blocking the implantation of fertilized eggs does not constitute abortion, and the second is that morning-after pills do not block the implantation of fertilized eggs. Both of these claims are built upon half-truths and outright falsehoods that become evident through a comprehensive look at the scientific facts.\n\nWhen does life begin?\n\nRovner supports her first point simply by quoting Susan F. Wood, an associate professor of health policy at George Washington University and a former assistant commissioner for women\u2019s health at the FDA. Rovner sets the stage for this by stating that scientists thought morning-after pills \u201cmight make it more difficult for a fertilized egg to implant in a woman\u2019s uterus,\u201d but:\n\nTechnically, that\u2019s not an abortion, says Wood. \u201cWe know that about half of fertilized eggs never stick around. They just pass out of the woman\u2019s body,\u201d she says. \u201cAn abortifacient is something that interrupts an established pregnancy.\u201d\n\nThis claim, which NPR reports as a fact, stands in stark contrast to medical literature and the wide-ranging views of physicians, which reveal that what constitutes an abortifacient is a matter of great dispute. This is because the start of pregnancy typically is defined in two ways: either fertilization (when sperm unites with egg to form an embryo) or implantation (when the embryo implants in the uterus).\n\nMedical literature abounds with the use of both definitions, and a 1998 survey published in the Journal of Maternal-Fetal and Neonatal Medicine found that obstetricians/gynecologists were evenly split on this issue, with 50% stating that pregnancy begins at fertilization, and 48% stating that pregnancy begins at implantation. The Encyclopedia of Birth Control aptly summarizes the situation:\n\nAbortifacients, whether chemicals or objects, cause abortions, the termination of a pregnancy. However, because the definition of pregnancy varies, opinions vary greatly over just which contraceptives or fertility control methods involves abortifacients.\n\nAlthough views about when pregnancy begins vary among medical professionals, the science of embryology is clear that the genetic composition of pre-born humans is formed at the point of fertilization, and as the textbook Molecular Biology explains, this genetic information is \u201cthe very basis of life itself.\u201d It also determines gender, eye color, hair color, facial features, and characteristics such as intelligence and personality. Hence, a unique human life is formed at fertilization, and Wood\u2019s point that \u201chalf of fertilized eggs never stick around\u201d is as relevant to the issue of abortion as the statement that \u201call people eventually die\u201d is relevant to the issue of homicide. At its core, this is about the difference between actively ending a life and nature taking its course.\n\nNPR also neglects to report that Wood is an active political donor to Barack Obama and EMILY\u2019s List, a political action committee \u201cdedicated to electing pro-choice Democratic women to office.\u201d From 2008 through 2012, Wood\u2019s donations to EMILY\u2019s List totaled $6,100, which was the most she gave to any candidate or political action committee. Throughout the article, it is clear when Rovner is citing someone who is pro-life, but she leaves Wood\u2019s ideology unmentioned while uncritically accepting her claim that blocking the implantation of embryos does not constitute abortion.\n\nDo the drugs destroy embryos?\n\nNext, Rovner states that \u201cpeople like\u201d Gene Rudd, senior vice president of the Christian Medical and Dental Associations and a practicing OB-GYN, \u201cworry that even if what the drugs do is not technically abortion, it\u2019s still objectionable if it happens after fertilization.\u201d Rovner then proceeds to argue that science doesn\u2019t support the notion that \u201cemergency contraceptives\u201d block implantation. This second major point is also deceptively argued.\n\nThe manufacturers of all the pills in question have been required by the FDA to affirm that the drugs may block implantation. As such, the official company website for ella states that the drug \u201cmay also work by preventing attachment to the uterus.\u201d The website for Plan B One-Step states, \u201cIt is possible that Plan B One-Step\u00ae may also work by \u2026 preventing attachment (implantation) to the uterus (womb).\u201d And the website for Next Choice states that the drug \u201cworks by preventing \u2026 attachment of the egg (implantation) to the uterus (womb).\u201d\n\nHowever, in June 2012, the New York Times published an article claiming that these labels \u201cdo not reflect what the science shows.\u201d NPR cites this Times article as \u201cfairly definitive research\u201d showing that the Plan B drug works only \u201cby preventing ovulation, and therefore, fertilization.\u201d The article, written by Pam Belluck, asserts that \u201cstudies have not established that emergency contraceptive pills prevent fertilized eggs from implanting in the womb, leading scientists say.\u201d Who are these leading scientists?\n\nOne of them is Susan Wood, the same professor quoted by NPR. Like NPR, the Times fails to reveal that she is an active political donor to Barack Obama and EMILY\u2019S list. Another key authority quoted in both of these articles is Diana Blithe, a biochemist and contraceptive researcher at the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. As it turns out, she also is an active political donor to Barack Obama and gave him $2,500 in 2012. Naturally, political associations don\u2019t determine whether someone is right or wrong, but both articles rely upon the assertions of these individuals to make key points and quote them as if they were neutral scientific authorities.\n\nThe Times quotes several other authorities to support its claims, but the only clinical evidence presented in either of these articles is three studies conducted in Australia and Chile. The Times describes all of the studies with a combined total of five sentences that provide a short synopsis, the years the studies were conducted, the name of one of the researchers, and a quote from Blithe. No data is presented, no links to the studies are provided, no titles are revealed, and no journals are cited. Just Facts identified two of the studies, one of which is also cited by NPR, which, in contrast to the Times, does provide a link to it. However, the details of these two studies actually undermine the central narratives of NPR and the Times.\n\nThe study cited by NPR determined how many women became pregnant after having unprotected sex during their fertile cycle and then taking the active ingredient in Plan B/Next Choice. Of 87 women who had not ovulated before taking the drug, none of them became pregnant, although based on the known odds of becoming pregnant, the study estimated that 13 typically would have become pregnant if they had not taken the drug. Conversely, of 35 women who had ovulated before taking the drug, 6 of them became pregnant, which is close to the 7 pregnancies that would be expected if they had not taken the drug.\n\nThese pregnancies among the women who ovulated before taking the drug provide a measure of evidence that the drug is not effective if administered after ovulation. Based on this minuscule sample of 6 pregnancies, NPR concluded that Plan B does not block implantation. The logic behind this, to quote NPR, is that the drug \u201cstops an egg from being released from a woman\u2019s ovary and thus prevents any chance of fertilization and pregnancy.\u201d For the drug to be reasonably effective through this mechanism, it should prevent ovulation until six days after intercourse because sperm can live for this long in a women\u2019s body. As explained in the textbook Langman\u2019s Medical Embryology, \u201csperm deposited in the reproductive tract up to 6 days prior to ovulation can survive to fertilize oocytes [eggs].\u201d\n\nThis is where the NPR and Times stories unravel. Although the abstract of study gives no indication of any significant caveats, if one is willing to purchase access to the full study (at a cost of $31.50) and examine its details, vital information is revealed. The study found that at least two thirds of the 87 women who had not yet ovulated before taking the drug actually ovulated within five days of taking the drug. This clashes with NPR\u2019s claim that the drug \u201cstops an egg from being released from a woman\u2019s ovary and thus prevents any chance of fertilization and pregnancy.\u201d Likewise, it undermines the Time\u2019s claim that \u201cscientists say the pills work up to five days after sex, primarily stalling an egg\u2019s release until sperm can no longer fertilize it.\u201d\n\nThe study\u2019s authors attempt to explain this result by theorizing that the drug causes \u201cincreased cervical mucus viscosity\u201d that \u201cimpedes the migration of sperm\u2026.\u201d In other words, they say it makes the mucous in a woman\u2019s reproductive tract so thick that sperm can\u2019t swim to the egg. To support this theory, the authors cite a 1974 study in the journal Contraception that found the drug had such an effect, but the authors fail to mention that a 2002 study in the same journal found that the drug \u201caffects sperm function only at high concentration and the contribution of these effects to emergency contraception is unlikely to be significant.\u201d\n\nEven more significantly, a 2007 study in the journal Human Reproduction found that at the dosage used for emergency contraception, \u201cthe drug had no effect on the quality of cervical mucus or in the penetration of spermatozoa to the uterine cavity.\u201d The second study identified by Just Facts that was cryptically mentioned in the Times is merely an extension of the first study, with a larger sample size (8 pregnancies instead of 6) and similar results.\n\nSo in summation, the scientific evidence is compelling that the active ingredient in Plan B and Next Choice doesn\u2019t delay ovulation beyond the timeframe that egg and sperm can unite to form a human life. Furthermore, the drug does not impair ability of sperm to swim to eggs. This doesn\u2019t mean that a yet unknown mechanism of the drug may prevent sperm and egg from uniting, but it does mean that the principal claims of NPR, the New York Times, and the majority of scientists they cite are not consistent with the known facts of this matter.\n\nWhat about ella and Italy?\n\nElla has a different active ingredient than the other two drugs, and the Times and NPR cite no specific clinical evidence to support their assertions that the drug probably does not derail implantation. They merely rely upon claims from scientists about unidentified studies, and both of the articles cite Blithe as their primary authority on this subject.\n\nBoth articles also point to the nation of Italy as evidence that ella doesn\u2019t cause abortions. To quote the Times:\n\nEuropean medical authorities have not mentioned an effect on implantation on Ella\u2019s label, and after months of scrutiny, Ella was approved for sale in overwhelmingly Catholic Italy, where laws would have barred it if it could be considered to induce abortion, said Erin Gainer, chief executive of Ella\u2019s manufacturer, Paris-based HRA Pharma.\n\nBased upon the statement above, one would believe that Italy bans abortions and would not have approved this drug unless the government was certain that it did not cause abortions. The reality is that abortion has been legal in Italy since 1978, and in 2009, the Italian agency responsible for approving drugs authorized the of use RU-486, which unambiguously is an abortifacient.\n\nHow about IUDs?\n\nIn this article, NPR doesn\u2019t mention IUDs or intrauterine devices, which the Obama administration is also forcing insurance plans to cover and to do so without copays. The Times article mentions in passing that \u201cscientists say\u201d IUDs \u201ccan work to prevent pregnancy after an egg has been fertilized.\u201d This is borne out by a wealth of evidence including a 2002 paper on the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology, which shows that \u201cboth prefertilization and postfertilization mechanisms of action contribute significantly to the effectiveness of all types of intrauterine devices.\u201d\n\nLikewise, the Obama Administration\u2019s Department of Health and Human Services, which is the same department that issued the contraceptive/abortifacient mandate, has published a \u201cBirth control methods fact sheet,\u201d which states that copper IUDs can keep \u201cthe fertilized egg from implanting in the lining of the uterus,\u201d and hormonal IUDs affect \u201cthe ability of a fertilized egg to successfully implant in the uterus.\u201d\n\nThus, regardless of whether Plan B, Next Choice, or ella cause abortion, the Obama administration is forcing insurers, and thus, their customers to pay for devices that destroy embryos before they implant, which many doctors, scientists, and citizens consider to be abortion.\n\nThe article originally appeared at JustFacts and is reprinted with permission.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Live Action News", "description": "2 Like2 Tweet0 +10In a recent\u00a0National Public Radio\u00a0broadcast and accompanying article entitled \u201cMorning-After Pills Don\u2019t Cause Abortion, Studies Say,\u201d NPR journalist Julie Rovner reported that the Obama administration\u2019s contraceptive mandate doesn\u2019t force people to pay for abortion-inducing drugs.
