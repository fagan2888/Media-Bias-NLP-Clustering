As reported in the Corporate and Financial Weekly Digest edition of October 17, 2014, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission\u2019s Division of Swap Dealer and Intermediary Oversight (DSIO) provided self-executing relief from registration to certain would-be CPOs that delegate all of their investment management authority with respect to a particular pool to another registered CPO. As a result of such delegations, NFA members conducting Bylaw 1101 due diligence on a pool are not always able to readily identify the pool\u2019s CPO and confirm through NFA\u2019s BASIC system whether the CPO of that pool is an NFA member.\n\nTo help members identify delegation when conducting Bylaw 1101 due diligence, CPOs are now required to provide information in NFA\u2019s EasyFile system when filing a pool\u2019s annual financial statement that indicates whether the CPO has delegated investment management authority of a particular commodity pool pursuant to the DSIO relief. This information will be publicly available in NFA\u2019s BASIC system and an NFA member generally will be deemed to have satisfied its Bylaw 1101 due diligence obligations if the pool in question is listed in BASIC under a new \u201cDelegated Pools\u201d heading.\n\nNFA Notice I-15-3 is available here.\n\nSwathi G.
