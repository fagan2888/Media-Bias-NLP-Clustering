This is just one of the many \u201c18 Surprising Facts About Your Own Pee\u201d video produced by BuzzFeed, which goes on to say they weren\u2019t that off thousands of years ago, because ammonia found in stale urine will actually whiten your teeth.\n\nThe video lines up seven empty glasses and fills almost all of them to give viewers an idea of how much the average person pees, which is 6.3 cups a day. What\u2019s in all of that pee? Last year, a study published in the journal PLOS ONE, revealed it contains 3,079 different compounds that are streamed together from the kidneys, which clean out and filter the human body from waste.\n\nThe world record for longest consecutive peeing sessions is 508 seconds, which is almost eight-and-a-half minutes, while it takes the typical person only 20 seconds to finish their flow. The longest distance a person has ever peed was by Joey Wallace of Arizona who reached his stream 14 feet and one inch.\n\nUrine is a nitrogen source and it was once used as an ingredient in gunpowder.

In fact, it\u2019s only a myth that you should pee on jellyfish stings. Instead, it can actually set off the remaining stinging cells.\n\nRecently, the \u201cP-Mate\u201d was invented, which allows women to hover their urethra over the funnel-like device, which directs the pee away from their body much like a penis does. Not being able to pee in public is a problem that many women face, and while it\u2019s illegal in many places, most men do it all the time. Holding it in can be life-threatening. A 28-year-old California woman died from holding it in for a radio contest.
