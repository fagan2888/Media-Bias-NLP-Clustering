Santa and his reindeer could run into traffic today in Colorado, but no huge delays are expected, officials said.

While roads are not likely to be as busy on Thursday as they were Wednesday, Colorado Department of Transportation spokeswoman Amy Ford said to expect a slow and steady commute into the mountains and back. Folks going into the Grand Junction area, which got “hammered” with snow, should be cautious of slick roads and expect delays, as well, she said.

Westbound Interstate 70 closed just before 10 a.m. at the summit of Vail Pass due to multiple accidents, the Colorado Department of Transportation said.

Ford cautions that drivers heading into the mountain regions must have good tires — either snow or mud designated or equipped with chains — to make the trek.

“The traction law could be implemented at any time,” she said.

Those taking to the skies who aren’t lucky enough to have a sleigh could encounter some airport traffic at Denver International Airport.

Parking lots were filling fast, with the shuttle lots — Pikes Peak and Mt.Elbert — full as of 9:30 a.m.

This is a developing story that will be updated as more information becomes available.
