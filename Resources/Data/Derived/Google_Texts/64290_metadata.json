Spanking. Slapping. Even choking. The rougher, the better. Maybe you\u2019ve been there. You can\u2019t stand the sight of someone \u2014 possibly your ex \u2014 but there\u2019s no denying the chemistry that lingers when you spot each other. So, what better way to deal with the conflicting emotions than to channel all of your aggression into a good screw. It might not be the wisest choice at the time, but you act on it anyway. Have you ever wondered why? What makes you succumb to raw hate sex?\n\nThe Science Of Instant Physical Attraction\n\nFirst off, physical attraction is one of the main components of hate sex, also known as the act of having strong, forceful sex with someone you\u2019re attracted to but strongly dislike. (Think Chapman and Vause in Orange is the New Black when they get it on in the library in Season 3.) Visual stimuli greatly influence human sexuality, but from a biological standpoint there are several chemicals that influence your state of mind when you see someone you\u2019re physically attracted to. In fact, when the brain releases these chemicals, your altered mental state makes you behave differently than you normally would.\n\nA 2012 study published in The Journal of Neuroscience found the medial prefrontal cortex, which mediates decision-making, gets more active when you see someone you are physically attracted to. Researchers found when scanning speed daters\u2019 brains, those whose dorsomedial prefrontal cortex lit up were more likely to pursue a date with those they found to be attractive. Another study published in the journal Human Brain Mapping found the brain cells in four regions, including the inferior temporal cortex, right orbitofrontal cortex, left anterior cingulate cortex, and the right insula, alongside the caudate nucleus, released neurotransmitters like the \u201cfeel good\u201d chemical dopamine, the \u201cfight-or-flight\u201d chemical adrenaline, and serotonin when participants were physically attracted to someone.\n\nNow, this biological response is independent from whether the person is good or not \u2014 we can\u2019t help what we feel. April Masini , relationship expert and author says it\u2019s common for people to be attracted to those they know they\u2019re incompatible with, even if it\u2019s someone they hate.\n\n\u201cHaving sex to express feelings \u2014 whether the feelings are hatred, sadness, frustration, joy or love \u2014 is just a way of connecting. Hate sex is also that \u2014 a way to connect over a feeling. It may be that you think it\u2019s hate sex, but it just may be sex over frustration, disappointment, or sadness,\u201d she told Medical Daily.\n\nChildhood Years\n\nUsing sex to express feelings, however, may come from releasing repressed feelings from early on. Dr. Fran Walfish, Beverly Hills psychotherapist and author of The Self-Aware Parent, believes the behavior is deeply rooted in childhood.\n\nFor example, if a girl grew up with a narcissistic father who was either not around or preoccupied with his career or business, and really jipped her out of full measure of quality of attention, she\u2019s going to start settling for less.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s going to be very familiar with getting less than she deserves with a guy she is attracted to and she\u2019s going to be sexually drawn to and attracted to guys who give her less than a full tablespoon of what she deserves,\u201d Walfish told Medical Daily.\n\nLittle girl holding teddy bear while peeking out window.

With time, Walfish explains, women learn to act out on that anger with misdirected sexual aggression.\n\nHowever, the influence a parent of the opposite sex has on their child and future relationships is also seen in boys. Men who grew up with a mother who is cold, self-centered, or favored the other child tend to be drawn to women who also give them less than a full tablespoon, according to Walfish. In a relationship, the sexual energy revs up in the beginning, but once he gets in the relationship past four months, he starts to look beyond the sexual chemistry and begins to see what\u2019s there and what\u2019s not in the overall relationship.\n\n\u201cHe becomes resentful and can often project anger on his mom onto his girlfriend,\u201d Walfish said.\n\nThis coincides with a 2010 study published in the journal Child Development that found children, especially boys, who have insecure attachments to their mothers in the early years tend to have more behavioral problems later in childhood. These behavioral problems such as aggression or hostility were seen even years later. Requests that are discouraged rejected, or responded to inconsistently are what make children vulnerable to developing behavioral issues that tend to resurface in intimate relationships with the opposite sex.\n\nDr. Ben Michaelis, a clinical psychologist in New York City and author of Your Next Big Thing, believes these behavioral problems can also affect their perception of women. \u201cAs far as I can tell, hate sex fantasies exist primarily in men. Any man who would pursue this probably has a low opinion of women, or certainly the woman that he may be fantasizing about,\u201d Michaelis told Medical Daily.\n\nHate Sex Vs. Make-Up Sex: What\u2019s The Difference?\n\nSo, what about women with the same fantasies? Girl-on-girl action, to be specific. This brings us back to Chapman and Vause in OITNB. Two inmates played by Taylor Schilling and Laura Prepon, who share a hate/love relationship as it is, ferociously get it on in the library. It involves slapping, pushing, and rough-handling, but the roughness itself gets them going. The scene clearly demonstrates hate sex, although some viewers might argue, in a way, it was also make-up sex. But what\u2019s the difference, anyway?\n\n\u201cWhatever energy you use \u2014 the expression is just as important as the direction or the format the energy takes,\u201d Masini said.\n\nHate sex and make-up sex are similar in the sense they are both fueled by intense emotions. According to Dr. Hillary Goldsher, a Beverly Hills clinical psychologist who specializes in relationship therapy, make-up sex (in theory) is between two people who have an emotional, intimate connection come together after feeling separated by a disagreement. \u201cIt is one of many appropriate ways to reestablish a sense of unity after an argument,\u201d Goldsher told Medical Daily.\n\nCouple kissing up against the wall.

Couples may also be more likely to engage in make-up sex because it provides a certain high like cocaine, according to clinical psychologist Seth Meyers in blog for Psychology Today titled \"Make-Up Sex Hurts: Why and How to Avoid It.\"\n\nAlthough make-up sex can be good as long as it follows verbal communication and discussion, it should not be in lieu of. Meyers believes couples who use make-up sex inevitably use it as a band-aid for bigger intimacy issues. This creates the illusion that sex can resolve relationship problems, but this only leads to more dissatisfaction and disappointment.\n\nHigh On Hate\n\nNo one wants all that baggage. What\u2019s more appealing, to some, is achieving the same high with hate sex that Meyers describes couples experience with make-up sex. Tugging on your partner\u2019s hair and slapping them around may give you a rush far different from any vanilla sex you\u2019ve had before.\n\nIt\u2019s that adrenaline rush people crave and crossing boundaries they normally wouldn\u2019t with conventional sex. In short, they feel uninhibited and alive. For some, hate sex also replaces feelings of anger and vulnerability that are difficult and painful to tolerate. People with unresolved issues associated with low self-esteem and abandonment might use hate sex to feel a short-term sense of power and feeling wanted. \u201cThe respite from the painful feelings is usually the catalyst for participating in hate sex,\u201d Goldsher said.\n\nNow, whether you choose to do it can be risky. People who are able to have hate sex, recognize it for what it is and are able to make logical decisions about relationships. However, Masini warns, \u201cwhen people have hate sex and think it means something other than what it is, it\u2019s not so healthy.\u201d Engaging in hate sex or any hook up sex and thinking it means love or a committed relationship will only lead to being disappointed and depressed.\n\nSo while it may be a high or form of release, if you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re getting yourself into, hate sex may very well be a misguided way of dealing with your emotions.\n\nOr it may lead to one of the best orgasms of your life.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "hate sex, makeup sex, rough sex, hardcore sex, bdsm, s&m, dating, relationships, couples, sexual intercourse, intimacy", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Ever wonder why you love having sex with someone you hate?", "title": "The Fascinating Psychology Behind 'Hate Sex'", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/psychology-behind-angry-sex-why-you-love-hooking-someone-you-hate-345270", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/07/29/new-sex-column-main-photo.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Ever wonder why you love having sex with someone you hate?", "title": "The Fascinating Psychology Behind 'Hate Sex'", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/psychology-behind-angry-sex-why-you-love-hooking-someone-you-hate-345270", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/07/29/new-sex-column-main-photo.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/07/29/new-sex-column-main-photo.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "New Sex", "published_time": "2015-07-29T17:12:34-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-29T17:12:21-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Ever wonder why you love having sex with someone you hate?"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda4c6\"", "article_summary": "Hate sex and make-up sex are similar in the sense they are both fueled by intense emotions.\nHate Sex Vs.
