Bill Haslam, will replace Bob Cooper, who sought to keep the job.\n\nState Supreme Court justices announced their pick for the state\u2019s top attorney at a news conference Monday. Tennessee is the only state in which the court appoints the attorney general.\n\n\"I am profoundly grateful for this opportunity,\" Slatery said at the press conference.\n\nHe practiced law for 30 years in Knoxville before joining the Haslam administration in 2011.\n\nOn Twitter, the governor described Slatery as \"a thoughtful and strategic leader.\"\n\nThe justices narrowed the field to six candidates last week after a public hearing and private interviews. Other finalists were Eugene Bulso, Mark Fulks, state Sen. Doug Overby and Bill Young.\n\n\"He is an excellent lawyer with proven leadership ability and sound judgment,\" Chief Justice Sharon Lee said.\n\nAccording to news reports, the justices did not take questions at the news conference.\n\nThe decision comes on the heels of an unsuccessful effort to unseat Lee and Justices Cornelia Clark and Gary Wade in the Aug. 7 retention election.\n\nLt. Gov. Ron Ramsey\u2019s political action committee funded most of that effort with $425,000 in donations, campaign finance records show. He and other Republican lawmakers were critical of Cooper because he refused to join other states\u2019 attorneys general in a challenge of the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\"As the first Republican attorney general in Tennessee history, Herbert Slatery will be a strong advocate for the people of Tennessee and a vigilant defender of Tennessee\u2019s conservative reforms,\" Ramsey wrote on Facebook.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Chattanooga news, entertainment, opinion, editorials", "og": {"site_name": "Nooga.com", "description": "Slatery, chief legal counsel to Gov.
