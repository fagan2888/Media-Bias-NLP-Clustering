PATERSON — The suspect in the deadly shooting of a 12-year-old girl who was hit by a stray bullet while riding a scooter in northern New Jersey goes before a judge.

Jhymiere Moore faces an initial court appearance on Friday.

The 19-year-old was charged with first-degree murder and weapons charges in the death of Genesis Rincon after he turned himself in to police on Tuesday night.

Police believe the suspect was aiming a handgun at someone else when the girl was struck in the head on Saturday night in Paterson. She was kept on life support until Monday night so her organs could be donated.

His lawyer, Harley Breite, tells The Record newspaper his client will plead not guilty and is a “scapegoat.”

The girl’s stepfather says others were involved.
