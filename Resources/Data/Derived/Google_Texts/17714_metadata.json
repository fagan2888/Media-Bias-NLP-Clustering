It can contribute to diabetes, obesity, heart disease, and even mental illnesses like depression and anxiety. Yet, we still haven\u2019t quite figured out how to fight it, especially in an office setting.\n\nWhile standing desks are always an option \u007f\u2014 as well as being sure to take breaks every half hour to walk and stretch \u2014 researchers from the University of Iowa (UI) wanted to test the efficacy of another method: the desk bike. The team, led by Lucas Carr, assistant professor of health and human physiology at UI, provided 27 participants working at a company in Iowa City with a pedal device under their desk. They used the activeLife Trainer, a pedaling machine that goes under the desk and allows users to engage in low-intensity, consistent exercise throughout the day.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to see if workers would use these devices over a long period of time, and we found the design of the device is critically important,\u201d Carr said in a press release.\n\nThe researchers tested the devices on the employees for 16 weeks, tracking their daily pedal time. Most employees averaged about 50 minutes per day, but they were more likely to use their device if they found it comfortable and easy to use, and if it was their own rather than a shared one. Employees who pedaled more were more likely to lose weight, have better focus at work, and take fewer sick days.\n\nIndeed, squeezing in physical activity before, after, and during work can make a huge difference in your mental and physical health. But it\u2019s often hard to take time out during work for a 30-minute walk or run. Research has also shown that a quick workout might not be enough to balance out the 7.5 hours or more of sitting in the office. That\u2019s why it\u2019s all the more important to find ways to move around at your desk \u2014 even if it\u2019s low-intensity physical activity from using the pedal device.\n\nThe positive results of the study give hope to Carr, who aims to battle the sedentary lifestyles most Americans experience at home and work. At the end of the study, 70 percent of participants wanted to keep their \u201cdesk bike,\u201d hinting that providing workers with exercise options could make them healthier and happier.\n\nInterestingly, it\u2019s not the exercise freaks that Carr is targeting. Instead, he\u2019s trying to find a way to engage the employees who are less likely to go to the gym and be healthy in general. The pedal device could be an easy, low-resistance option for couch potatoes to get moving without going far. Then again, there\u2019s always the possibility that the multi-tasking effort put into typing while pedaling will be distracting. Nevertheless, having the option to try it is always nice.\n\n\u201cA lot of companies have gone the route of building expensive fitness facilities, that typically get used only by the most healthy employees,\u201d Carr said. \u201cThe people who need to improve their health the most are less likely to use worksite fitness facilities. This is something that could be provided to just about any employee, regardless of the size of their company or office.\u201d\n\nThe machine is literally \u201cright at their feet,\u201d he notes, \u201cand they can use it whenever they want without feeling self-conscious in front of their co-workers.\u201d\n\nSource: Carr L, Leonhard C, Tucker S, Fethke N, Benzo R, Gerr F.
