Instead, it should focus on the fact that Microsoft is a U.S.-based company under the government\u2019s jurisdiction. Two previous judges have upheld the government\u2019s warrant, and one found Microsoft in contempt.\n\n\u201cUnder long settled precedent, the power of compelled disclosure reaches records stored abroad so long as there is personal jurisdiction over the custodian and the custodian has control over the records,\u201d the government has argued.\n\nThe government also said that using the treaty process, which some encouraged, is an inadequate alternative to the warrant, since the treaty process can be time consuming and ineffective, because data often hops around from location to location.\n\nMicrosoft has blitzed the case from all sides \u2014 securing dozens of backers, setting up a website dedicated to the case and pushing legislation that would settle the issue outside the court.\n\nIt touts support from 28 tech and news companies, 23 trade associations and 35 \u201cleading computer scientists.\u201d Among them are tech companies such as Amazon, Apple, Cisco Systems, HP, eBay and Salesforce, as well as news organizations such as CNN, Fox News, NPR and The Washington Post.\n\nAside from the legal arguments, the company has also pointed to economic and practical considerations. It has argued that compliance with the warrant would invite other countries to seize U.S. citizens\u2019 correspondence in similar situations \u2014 when it is housed in the United States but maintained by a foreign-based company.\n\nThe government warned Microsoft is employing a common tactic to speculate about the economic cost of complying with a government order. It said those economic considerations are outweighed by the government interest.\n\n\u201cWith the benefits of corporate citizenship in the United States come corresponding responsibilities, including the responsibility to comply with a disclosure order issued by a U.S. court. Microsoft should not be heard to complain that doing so might harm its bottom line,\u201d the government argued.\n\nThe case on Wednesday will be heard by three Obama appointees: Judge Gerard Lynch, Judge Susan Carney and Connecticut District Judge Victor Bolden.\n\nThe case centers around a 2013 warrant the government obtained to access a Microsoft-hosted email account allegedly connected to U.S. drug trafficking. But Microsoft resisted after finding out that the email content was stored in its Dublin-based storage center set up in 2010.\n\nIn the government\u2019s brief, lawyers repeatedly point out that Microsoft operated the Dublin datacenter for three years before ever raising objections to avoid compliance.\n\nThe email owner\u2019s identity and citizenship is not known and is not at issue in the case. Microsoft generally tries to store data as close to a customer as possible, but it determines customer location based on the person\u2019s self-selected country of residence when the account is created, which could be false.\n\nObservers, and even supporters of Microsoft, have acknowledged the competing interests at play and have speculated Congress might have to step in to clarify the law, regardless of the ruling.\n\nAnd not all tech companies are agreed on how that legislation should look.\n\nMicrosoft has backed the LEADS Act in Congress, which would allow the government to use a warrant to get access to Americans\u2019 data stored overseas, but not from foreigners. Under the bill, a U.S. company could fight the government order if it would violate the foreign country\u2019s laws.\n\nWhile companies such as Apple, Microsoft, IBM, The App Association, and about 25 other groups have applauded the legislation pushed by Sen.
