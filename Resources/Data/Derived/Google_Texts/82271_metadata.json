This is a step in the right direction.\"\n\nThe cuts affect a combination of direct care staff and support workers in various departments, including hospital administration and nursing assistants. Hospital employees are not union members.\n\nIt is the first layoff since the North Sonoma County Healthcare District took over operations of the 108-year-old hospital in 2002, said Vivian Beaulieu, an executive assistant. The district is mainly comprised of Windsor, Healdsburg, Geyserville, Cloverdale and the surrounding areas and serves approximately 60,000 residents.\n\nSchmid said the layoffs will not affect quality of care.\n\n\"We are hopeful this is the only time we will have to do this, because it's never easy. However, we will continue to re-evaluate in the coming months,\" she said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Healdsburg District Hospital announced plans Thursday to lay off 30 employees, or", "story version": 2016, "og": {"site_name": "Santa Rosa Press Democrat", "description": "Healdsburg District Hospital announced plans Thursday to lay off 30 employees.", "title": "Healdsburg hospital to lay off 30 employees", "url": "http://www.pressdemocrat.com/none/2477780-181//article/20131114/BUSINESS/131119751/", "image": "http://www.pressdemocrat.com/csp/mediapool/sites/dt.common.streams.StreamServer.cls?STREAMOID=foUPYmpjJ1tSeehQyd7kMs$daE2N3K4ZzOUsqbU5sYtC1HE9mbuQBj14M5MbIA02WCsjLu883Ygn4B49Lvm9bPe2QeMKQdVeZmXF$9l$4uCZ8QDXhaHEp3rvzXRJFdy0KqPHLoMevcTLo3h8xh70Y6N_U_CryOsw6FTOdKL_jpQ-&CONTENTTYPE=image/jpeg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100003031242373, "app_id": 125780984227497}, "msvalidate.01": "9E66801B649686495190ABE3DA8985E7", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pressdemocrat", "published_time": "2013-11-14T19:24:57-08:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Healdsburg District Hospital announced plans Thursday to lay off 30 employees, or 8 percent of its workforce, as it adapts to changes in the way health care is delivered.\nThe hospital attempted to minimize the number of layoffs by slowing hiring, leaving open positions unfilled and reassigning some employees, Schmid said.\nHospital employees are not union members.\nSusan Spoelma, chief nursing officer, said that hospitals across the country are expecting less revenue due to changes in the health care system.\nCEO Nancy Schmid said the hospital is revising its operational and care models to meet the needs of patients while responding to cost-cutting pressures unleashed by federal health care reform."}
