But two days into her 2013 trip, her water unexpectedly broke; she spent the next six weeks on bed rest, and her daughter was delivered prematurely via an emergency C-section.\n\nA year later, the Huculaks and their daughter are healthy and back at home. But they\u2019re now facing medical bills that total $950,000 for the hospital care they received in the United States last fall. \u201cIt makes you sick to your stomach,\u201d Huculak told CTV News. \u201cWho can pay a million-dollar medical bill? Who can afford that?\u201d\n\nAlthough the couple purchased travel insurance from Blue Cross before their vacation, the insurance company says that Huculak\u2019s previous pregnancy complications \u2014 she had a bladder infection when she was four months pregnant \u2014 amounted to a pre-existing condition, so her medical expenses won\u2019t be covered. Blue Cross also maintains that the Huculaks\u2019 plan expired while they were still in Hawaii.\n\nJennifer Huculak told CBC News that she\u2019s frustrated with Blue Cross because she thought she did everything right. She had approval from her doctor to travel, and after her water broke, she tried to figure out how to return to Canada. But she couldn\u2019t find a medical evacuation company that was willing to transport her home in her condition.\n\nIt\u2019s not entirely uncommon for visitors to the U.S. to accrue big medical bills if they suffer from a health condition while they\u2019re here. Travel insurance isn\u2019t currently subject to all of the regulations under the Affordable Care Act \u2014 and the health reform law doesn\u2019t apply to people who aren\u2019t U.S. residents \u2014 so there can be confusion about how exactly these plans will work in practice. Other Canadian travelers have been stuck with hefty bills after unexpectedly suffering from kidney failure and struggling with high blood pressure while in the United States.\n\nBut bills for childbirth are particularly exorbitant. Giving birth in the United States costs more than anywhere else in the world, even when the procedure doesn\u2019t involve the serious complications that Jennifer Huculak experienced. The price tag for this type of care varies widely \u2014 by up to tens of thousands of dollars \u2014 depending on which hospital you decide to go to. But the cost fluctuations are seemingly random, since high prices for childbirth services don\u2019t correlate with a higher quality of care for American mothers.\n\nIronically, the Huculaks hail from the Canadian province that was the first region of their country to implement universal, publicly-funded health care. They say they\u2019re now trying to decide if they should fight Blue Cross over their bill or declare bankruptcy.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "\"Who can pay a million-dollar medical bill?
