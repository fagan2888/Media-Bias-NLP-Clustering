Vote Now in Urgent Poll\n\nEditor's Note:\n\nDo You Support Obamacare? Vote in Urgent National Poll\n\nKristin Scott Thomas, the British actress best known for her roles in \"The English Patient\" and \"Four Weddings and a Funeral,\" announced this week that she's quitting film acting because she's \"bored.\"Thomas, who has appeared in both English and French-speaking films throughout her 30-year movie career, told The Guardian that she simply \"cannot cope with another film.\" \"I realized I've done the things I know how to do so many times in different languages, and I just suddenly thought, I can't do it any more. I'm bored by it. So I'm stopping,\" the 53-year-old actress said.Thomas also said she sometimes felt that the projects she agreed to needed her more than she needed them.\"I'm often asked to do something because I'm going to be a sort of weight to their otherwise flimsy production,\" she said. \"They need me for production purposes, basically. So they give me a little role in something where they know I'm going to be able to turn up, know what to do, cry in the right place. I shouldn't bite the hand that feeds, but I keep doing these things for other people, and last year I just decided life's too short. I don't want to do it any more.\"The actress said she plans to focus on stage work, where she has more freedom than on a film set.\"Basically, when you are acting in a film, you're giving the director the raw material to make the film,\" she told The Guardian. \"But when you're acting on stage, that's it. And that's when you discover that you can really do it.\"", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "kristin scott thomas,quits,film,acting", "pubdate": "2014-02-04T14:02:27", "og": {"site_name": "Newsmax", "description": "Kristin Scott Thomas, the British actress best known for her roles in \"The English Patient\" and \"Four Weddings and a Funeral,\" announced this week that she's quitting film acting because she's \"bored.\"", "title": "Kristin Scott Thomas Quitting Film Acting Because She's 'Bored'", "url": "http://www.newsmax.com/TheWire/kristin-scott-thomas-quits-film-acting/2014/02/04/id/550858/", "type": "article", "image": "http://www.newsmax.com/CMSPages/GetFile.aspx?guid=bf78796b-5483-4117-991c-ef2823821675&SiteName=Newsmax", "page_id": 85452072376}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.newsmax.com/TheWire/kristin-scott-thomas-quits-film-acting/2014/02/04/id/550858/", "title": "Kristin Scott Thomas Quitting Film Acting Because She's 'Bored'", "description": "Kristin Scott Thomas, the British actress best known for her roles in \"The English Patient\" and \"Four Weddings and a Funeral,\" announced this week that she's quitting film acting because she's \"bored.\"", "site": "Newsmax"}, "fb": {"admins": 100002083767056, "app_id": 323020797885219}, "msvalidate.01": "FAF1322EC761685A5DD9344A1C19E82A", "epoch": 1391522547, "google-site-verification": "Jt2HUKgzJJw9VwIQJv31ETytuvNNm5ypTWN6j0nYvHM", "keywords": "kristin scott thomas,quits,film,acting", "article": {"section": "TheWire", "published_time": "2014-02-04T14:02:27"}, "original-source": "http://www.newsmax.com/TheWire/kristin-scott-thomas-quits-film-acting/2014/02/04/id/550858/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "description": "Kristin Scott Thomas, the British actress best known for her roles in  The English Patient  and  Four Weddings and a Funeral,  announced this week that she's quitting film acting because she's  bored."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9494\"", "article_summary": "\"Basically, when you are acting in a film, you're giving the director the raw material to make the film,\" she told The Guardian.\nVote in Urgent National PollKristin Scott Thomas, the British actress best known for her roles in \"The English Patient\" and \"Four Weddings and a Funeral,\" announced this week that she's quitting film acting because she's \"bored.\n\"But when you're acting on stage, that's it.\nSo they give me a little role in something where they know I'm going to be able to turn up, know what to do, cry in the right place.\n\"Thomas, who has appeared in both English and French-speaking films throughout her 30-year movie career, told The Guardian that she simply \"cannot cope with another film.\""}
