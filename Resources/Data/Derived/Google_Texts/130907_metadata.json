Workers in all four jurisdictions covered by Tuesday\u2019s ballot measures will be able to earn one hour of paid sick leave for every 30 hours worked.\n\nPaid sick leave has been gaining traction in recent years. Since San Francisco passed a paid sick leave measure in 2006, 16 cities and three states have followed suit. These measures build on the Family and Medical Leave Act, passed in 1993, which required employers to grant workers up to 12 weeks annually in unpaid leave for illness or to take care of an ailing family member.

The White House has advocated so-called trade promotion authority \u2014 which would allow U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman to cut trade deals without debate or amendments on the Hill \u2014 but Congress has yet to make meaningful moves on the measure. Unions say that new trade deals like the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement with Japan and 10 other nations in Asia and the Pacific have been negotiated with little transparency or input from workers' groups. But Obama will likely have Republican support on the measure. \u201cEvery President since FDR has sought trade promotion authority from Congress because of the job-creating benefits of trade,\" Utah Republican Senator Orrin Hatch said in January. \"Renewing TPA will help advance a robust trade agenda that will help American businesses, workers, farmers and ranchers by giving them greater access to overseas markets.\" Pros can read more here: http://politico.pro/1vLhgWs\n\nGOOD MORNING and welcome to Morning Shift, where we're still recovering from election night.

It doesn\u2019t matter whether that candidate is a Democrat or a Republican.\" More here from Mike Elk and Marianne LeVine for Pros: http://politico.pro/1uzVzNQ\n\nBusiness groups want trade deals, tax reform: \"We\u2019re asking our elected officials to just solve problems,\" said the National Association of Manufacturers: \"extend important tax policies, such as the R&D tax credit; make comprehensive tax reform happen; fix our nation\u2019s broken immigration system; stop the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s assault on American energy security; invest in our aging infrastructure; pass a long-term reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank; move Trade Promotion Authority; and enact regulatory reform to name just some of the issues that need immediate action.\"\n\nWeingarten: red tide of hostile governors coming: Teachers unions must gird to \u201cfight back as hard, if not harder, than we ever have before\u201d against a red tide of hostile governors across the nation, American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten told POLITICO yesterday.\n\nMCCONNELL TO TARGET ACA'S 30-HOUR WORK WEEK \u2014 At a press conference yesterday, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said that his Senate Republican majority will target \u201cdeeply unpopular\u201d pieces of the Affordable Care Act, including the law\u2019s 30-hour work week standard for the employer mandate and the individual mandate,\" POLITICO's Rachana Pradhan reports. The law requires employers of 50 or more full time workers to offer health insurance to full time workers, defined for the purposes of the statute as workers employed for 30 hours a week or more. \"McConnell said the loss of the 40-hour workweek because of Obamacare is a 'big mistake that ought to be restored' and that 'people hate the individual mandate.\u2019\u201d Pros can read more here: http://politico.pro/1AmbbaM\n\nRead More: McConnell wrote an op-ed in today\u2019s Wall Street Journal outlining his agenda.\n\nOBAMA LOST BIG ON IMMIGRATION GAMBLE\u2014\"President Barack Obama took a major gamble when he punted executive action on immigration earlier this fall to try and save red-state Senate Democrats \u2014 and it didn\u2019t pay off,\" POLITICO'S Seung Min Kim reports.\n\nVulnerable Senate Democrats like Kay Hagan of North Carolina and Mark Pryor of Arkansas both lost despite the delay. And the move might have hurt Democratic Sen. Mark Udall in Colorado, which has a large Latino electorate. \"With steep Democratic losses, Obama is left with a Republican-controlled Senate, whose leaders are already warning Obama that life will become much more difficult if he goes ahead with promised executive action halting deportations for undocumented immigrants,\" Kim writes. \"Meanwhile, the president faces an even more infuriated community of Latinos and immigrant-rights activists who see no political upside to the executive action delay.\" http://politi.co/1xadMB4\n\n** A message from The International Franchise Association.
