Obama has also pressed Congress to raise the federally mandated minimum wage as well.\n\nObama reassured raising the minimum wage won\u2019t cause harm, but will \u201cboost\u201d the economy. Few economists would go this far however. Instead, most agree there is mixed evidence.\n\nFor instance, economists have found evidence that raising the minimum wage can lead to businesses laying off workers, hiring fewer workers, and reducing business expansion. Others have found that it raises prices of good and services many low-income Americans depend on, and may even discourage workers from receiving further training and education. In their meta-analysis of over 100 studies, economists David Neumark and William Wascher conclude \u201cthe minimum wage leads to economic distortions and often has unintended adverse consequences for the employment opportunities of low-skilled workers.\u201d\n\nIs it really that hard to believe that raising the minimum wage is going to cost somebody something?\n\nNevertheless, other economists have failed to detect significant costs. For instance in Hristos Doucouliagos\u2019 and Thomas Stanley\u2019s meta-analysis of 64 studies, they conclude there are no \u201cmeaningful adverse\u201d effects on employment. Although even economist and New York Times columnist Paul Krugman suspects that setting a minimum wage high enough, say at $20 and hour, \u201cwould create a lot of problems.\u201d\n\nFormer Obama administration economist Christina Romer synthesized the contradictory effects of a minimum wage hike in the New York Times, acknowledging the presence of small adverse effects depending on the size of the increase.\n\nSo are Americans willing to take the risk of harming job opportunities during a time of high unemployment, particularly among African-American teenagers (35.5%) and young people generally (22%)? It would be difficult to tell based on most public opinion polls which presents the question not as an economic trade-off, but as a benefits-only proposition.\n\nIn my recent op-ed in the Washington Times, I explain how public support for a minimum wage increase plummets as soon as Americans consider the possible costs.
