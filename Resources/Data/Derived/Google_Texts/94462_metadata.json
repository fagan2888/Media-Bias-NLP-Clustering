The latest twist on their gruesome, partisan rationalization is to blame the Navy Yard shootings on the fact that the area was a \u201cgun free zone\u201d within a city of tight gun control restrictions. This plainly ignores the facts and dishonors those killed.\n\nWhile we know very little about the Navy Yard shootings, it\u2019s likely that several of those on the scene \u2014 including, potentially, several victims \u2014 were highly trained and armed military police officers. After all, \u201cgun free zones\u201d only apply to civilians, not legitimate, armed security personnel. But more important, everything we know about recent mass shootings defeats this preposterous argument. According to a comprehensive study by Mother Jones magazine, in the past 30 years, not a single mass shooting has been stopped by an armed civilian. According to a study by Mayors Against Illegal Guns, less than a quarter of mass shootings in the last four years occurred in \u201cgun free zones.\u201d Moreover, according to the Mother Jones study, there is not a single piece of evidence that any shooters deliberately chose to target locations where guns were prohibited.\n\nFurther, as Chris Hayes artfully pointed out in his response to the Navy Yard shootings, having more armed civilians in the vicinity of a mass shooting is likely to lead to more carnage, not less. According to a study by the New York Times, highly trained New York City police officers who discharged their guns in public hit their intended targets only 34 percent of the time. To put it differently, the police missed their targets \u2014 and hit something else \u2014 two out of every three shots. Now imagine even the best-trained amateur gun owners and what their record might be.\n\nTo be honest, though, even having to dispel the conservative \u201cargument\u201d here is ludicrous. After all, nine in 10 Americans\u2014 and even three-quarters of gun owners \u2014 support basic, common-sense laws to ensure gun safety. The American people are sick and tired of almost weekly mass atrocities, which, yes, have something to do with the collapse of affordable and accessible mental health care in America (not that conservatives are rushing to support healthcare reform) but also has to do with the very dangerous weapons that are all too easily accessible to very dangerous people.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Their partisan rationalizations include blaming gun safety measures.
