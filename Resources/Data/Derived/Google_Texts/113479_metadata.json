For left-wing saboteurs and their Big Business GOP enablers, this means throwing our unique patent system and its constitutional underpinnings under an 18-wheeler. So-called \u201cpatent reform\u201d proposals continue to plague Capitol Hill. But like health care \u201creform\u201d and education \u201creform,\u201d these government cures are worse than any purported disease.\n\nAs part of his ongoing bid to \u201cfundamentally transform\u201d America, President Obama signed the Orwellian-titled America Invents Act (AIA) in 2011. If truth-in-advertising laws applied to politicians who front massively complex bills that do the opposite of what they proclaim to do, these hucksters would be jailed for their patently fraudulent \u201creform\u201d legislation. Co-sponsored by Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., and Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, the law was marketed as a job-creation vehicle that would relieve a backlog of an estimated 700,000 patent applications and crack down on patent \u201ctrolls\u201d supposedly abusing the system through frivolous litigation against alleged infringers.\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nIn truth, the AIA and its legislative successors are special interest boondoggles that enrich corporate lawyers, Big Business, and federal bureaucrats at the expense of the independent inventors and fledgling innovators the American patent system was created to protect and encourage.\n\nThe AIA\u2019s primary agenda? \u201cHarmonizing\u201d our patent laws with the rest of the world to reward paper-pushers who are \u201cfirst to file\u201d at the patent office, instead of those who are \u201cfirst to invent.\u201d These and other measures enacted by Obama threaten to drive garage tinkerers and small inventors \u2014 the designers, engineers, and builders of American prosperity \u2014 out of the marketplace. Longtime venture capitalist Gary Lauder noted that the first-to-file system has suppressed solo and small-business innovation in Europe and Japan. \u201cThe U.S. gets 10 times the angel and venture capital of Western Europe \u2014 which recently declared an \u2018innovation emergency,'\u201d Lauder observed. \u201cSo why are we harmonizing with them? They should be harmonizing with us.\u201d\n\nAmen! Our founders knew that progress would come not merely at the hands of \u201cgreat\u201d inventors pioneering extraordinary breakthroughs, but also by the widespread invention and improvement of ordinary and \u201csmall\u201d contrivances and advancements. In 1790, they created and refined a decentralized, market-based patent system that added the \u201cfuel of interest\u201d to the \u201cfire of genius,\u201d in the words of America\u2019s only president to hold a patent, Abraham Lincoln.\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nRather than denigrate the profit motive, the patent and copyright clause of the Constitution celebrates and encourages \u201cindividual effort by personal gain (as) the best way to advance public welfare through the talents of authors and inventors.\u201d\n\nBut the European-style \u201cfirst to file\u201d now in place in America is a \u201cforced to file\u201d regime that incentivizes a hasty stampede to the federal patent office. In the name of global harmony, we now reward paper-pushing attorneys \u2014 whether or not they\u2019re representing true first inventors. Instead of \u201cstreamlining\u201d the application process and reducing paperwork backlogs, the AIA induces corporations to inundate patent examiners with incomplete placeholder applications that will inevitably need to be amended, refined, and reconsidered. This is not patent \u201creform.\u201d It\u2019s a Big Business Patent Lawyers\u2019 Full Employment Act.\n\nLike Obamacare, the sheer size and complexity of the AIA nullify the dubious benefits the White House and its statist lobbying pals claim it will bring. University of Virginia law professor John Duffy points out that the law is 140 pages long, \u201cmore than twice the length of the entire federal patent statute\u201d since its last recodification in 1952. Stuffed with earmarks and bribes for the banking industry, Michigan Democrats who lobbied for a new satellite patent office in Detroit, and other well-connected cronies, the AIA\u2019s 37 sections are intentionally complex. Its sloppy drafting will result in \u201ccases interpreting the law going to the courts for 20 years before lawyers really know how to advise clients,\u201d patent lawyer David Boundy predicted.\n\nThis week, yet another similar patent \u201creform\u201d package that supposedly takes aim at a tiny minority of patent \u201ctrolls\u201d (again) is being rammed through Congress. But in practice, the \u201cInnovation Act\u201d legislation (H.R. 9) \u201cmakes it harder for garage inventors and small businesses to protect themselves from having their inventions and ideas stolen,\u201d inventor Louis Foreman warns, by further obstructing their ability to enforce their intellectual property rights and bring legitimate patent infringement cases to court.\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nGlobal competitors certainly pose serious external threats to America\u2019s role as an innovation leader. But we face grave existential threats within our own borders: homegrown ignorance, apathy, and downright hostility toward the independent entrepreneurs who make America great. Real \u201creform\u201d begins with the repeal of the innovation-stifling \u201cAmerica Invents Act\u201d and a return to first constitutional principles that maintain a level playing field among makers and builders of all shapes and sizes.\n\nCOPYRIGHT 2015 CREATORS.COM\n\nThe views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by the owners of this website.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Yet another progressive horror story of abandoning what works in the name of what's politically trendy.", "author": "Michelle Malkin", "og": {"site_name": "Western Journalism", "description": "Yet another progressive horror story of abandoning what works in the name of what's politically trendy.", "title": "How Obama Radically Transformed America's Patent System", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 914, "identifier": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/obamapatent-e1455986125836.jpg", "height": 609}, "url": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/how-obama-radically-transformed-americas-patent-system/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Yet another progressive horror story of abandoning what works in the name of what's politically trendy.", "creator": "@WestJournalism", "image": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/obamapatent-e1455986125836.jpg", "title": "How Obama Radically Transformed America's Patent System", "site": "@WestJournalism", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "DC.date.issued": "2015-05-22T08:46:25-07:00", "fb": {"app_id": 275784739127435, "pages": 123624513983}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/android-chrome-192x192.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WesternJournalism", "section": "Opinion", "tag": "United States Of America", "published_time": "2015-05-22T08:46:25-07:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "america invents act, aia, innovation act, patent law, change patent law, harder for inventors, obama screwing over inventors, h.r. 9, patent infringement, barack obama, congress, united states of america, politics, nation, religion"}, "article_summary": "For left-wing saboteurs and their Big Business GOP enablers, this means throwing our unique patent system and its constitutional underpinnings under an 18-wheeler.\nThis is not patent \u201creform.\u201d It\u2019s a Big Business Patent Lawyers\u2019 Full Employment Act.\nThis week, yet another similar patent \u201creform\u201d package that supposedly takes aim at a tiny minority of patent \u201ctrolls\u201d (again) is being rammed through Congress.\nIn 1790, they created and refined a decentralized, market-based patent system that added the \u201cfuel of interest\u201d to the \u201cfire of genius,\u201d in the words of America\u2019s only president to hold a patent, Abraham Lincoln.\nSo-called \u201cpatent reform\u201d proposals continue to plague Capitol Hill."}
