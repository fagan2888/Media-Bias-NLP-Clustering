( Cliff Grassmick )\n\n\n\nThe team of neighbors and friends is known for its crazy costumes \u2014 green wigs, oversized glasses, striped hats and tutus are popular choices \u2014 and dance moves using metal chairs choreographed to \u201cWe Will Shamrock You,\u201d an Irish-tinged rendition of Queen's \u201cWe Will Rock You.\u201d\n\n\n\nTeam members admitted to a limited amount of practice time, but promised to continue the tradition of a routine that's as silly as possible.

While Boulder's may not technically be the shortest in terms of distance, it may win out for the shortest in time, taking around 20 minutes.<\n\n\n\nThis year, Boulder's parade announcer took note of the challenge to its title, asking if Hot Springs could boast the world's smallest St. Patrick's Day floats. The tiny floats were created by a Boulder Outdoor Cinema team.\n\n\n\nMegan Holschen, a Broomfield 11-year-old, incorporated a stuffed bunny and peeps into her float, while her brother, 10-year-old Ethan, went with spiderman and army men.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt's really cool that a lot of people show up to such a short parade,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\nAfter the parade, Conor O'Neill's kept the parade spirit going Irish food, drinks, music and more dancing.\n\n\n\n\"It's a beautiful day and a great family event,\u201d said Boulder's Peter Jordan, who brought his sons. \u201cAll the Irish of Boulder are here. It just feels like everybody knows everybody.
