And while the city of Pismo Beach recently issued a building moratorium as the drought continues and the region decreases its water use, most in the industry do not expect bigger cities to follow suit in the near-term.\n\nBrokers and industry sources said they expect 2015\u2019s momentum to roll into the New Year.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a good year and I\u2019m bullish on 2016,\u201d Lee & Associates Principal Steve Leider said. \u201cThings are starting to feel better but it\u2019s not like the economy is running full speed. There is still some trepidation out there but I think that will fade.\u201d\n\nRetail rolling\n\nIt\u2019s a good sign for the tri-county commercial real estate market when retailers and service providers, both chain and independently owned, are adding locations.\n\nWhile space in places like Santa Barbara continually draw interest due to its tourism-fueled economy, that lure seems to be spilling over into other areas throughout the Tri-Counties.\n\nProposed projects and ones already underway \u2014 like the Hollister Village in Goleta, commercial and housing space proposed for downtown San Luis Obispo and redevelopment along Thousand Oaks Boulevard \u2014 seem to be attracting businesses.\n\nOne example is Los Agaves. The Santa Barbara-based Mexican eatery recently landed in Westlake Village with its fourth location.\n\nThat region is starting to attract new companies, like a Ferrari showroom on Willow Lane, especially around Thousand Oaks Boulevard. The boulevard\u2019s specific plan has facilitated more redevelopment and building upgrades that will hopefully draw more tenants.\n\nLos Agaves, which opened its first location on Milpas Street in 2008, opened a second space on De La Vina in 2013 and a third at the Camino Real Marketplace in Goleta. Jane, On The Alley and Pascucci have opened or will soon open second locations at the marketplace.\n\nIn San Luis Obispo, Cal Poly plans to renovate the Blackstone-Sauer building on Monterey Street to house 32 innovation and entrepreneurship students. It will feature 6,000 square feet of commercial space and 12,600 square feet of residential.\n\nThere is also an 80-room hotel and plaza proposed for the heart of downtown as well as a new public market.\n\n\u201cSan Luis Obispo is going to be exploding,\u201d Lee & Associates broker Vivian Hanover previously told the Business Times.\n\nSenior housing hot\n\nThere are dozens of rental housing developments in the pipeline throughout the Tri-Counties, especially ones catering to the region\u2019s aging demographic.\n\n\u201cThe demand for senior housing is pretty significant and will likely continue,\u201d Winton Berci, an associate at the real estate brokerage company Marcus & Millichap\u2019s Oxnard office, previously told the Business Times.\n\nRRM Design Group is developing two affordable senior housing developments in Santa Barbara featuring close to 150 units.\n\nVentura County has 11 senior housing projects underway, according to data from Marcus & Millichap.\n\nThe Towbes Group is developing the Westgate senior housing development that would add 189 units near Blosser and Battles roads in Santa Maria.\n\nIn addition, the office building at 5464 Carpinteria Ave. will be converted to a 76-bed senior living property. Irvine-based Steadfast Companies purchased the property for\n\n$10.7 million.\n\nApartment vacancy rates average around 0.6 percent on Santa Barbara County\u2019s South Coast, about 2 percent in North Santa Barbara County, just more than 2.1 percent in West Ventura County and a little less than 2 percent in San Luis Obispo County.\n\nThe average rent for a one-bedroom apartment in Santa Barbara is $1,518 a month, up from $1,383 a year ago.\n\nLeider does not expect the Fed\u2019s rate hike to have a short-term impact on real estate investment, but it may cause some developers to pause and reconsider in about 18 months.\n\nDrought persists\n\nThe city of Pismo Beach recently issued a tiered building moratorium.\n\nThe first tier is effective immediately \u2014 the city will not issue new building permits but permits already in the pipeline will move forward.\n\nNew applications will still be accepted throughout the process and the city will evaluate the water supply monthly and change the tiers as necessary.\n\nIndustry sources said other tri-county cities are not preparing similar measures yet, but they are hoping for a wet winter.\n\n\u2022 Contact Alex Kacik at [email protected]", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "real estate,drought,federal reserve,pismo beach,retail,commercial,tri-counties,goleta,san luis obispo,thousand oaks,los agaves,cal poly,senior,housing,oxnard,,columns,latest news", "og": {"site_name": "Pacific Coast Business Times", "description": "Despite the slight increase of interest rates and the drought\u2019s persistence, real estate brokers are bullish on 2016.
