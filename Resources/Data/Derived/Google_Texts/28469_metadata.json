They can apply for bail only from Karnataka High Court which is on vacation till October 6 for Dasara.\n\nThe Rs 100 crore fine is the highest imposed on any politician by the special judge who heard the case of Rs 66.65 crore disproportionate assets acquired during her first term as Chief Minister between 1991 and 1996.\n\nThe conviction in the high-security court complex of Parappana Agrahara near here came amidst dramatic scenes outside where AIADMK supporters burnt effigies of DMK leader Karunanidhi and Subramaniam Swamy who had initially raked up the case.\n\nThe conviction also evoked sporadic violence in Tamil Nadu where public vehicles were attacked and shops closed.\n\nThe Directorate of Vigilance and Anti-corruption had filed a charge sheet in the case which was transferred to the court here in 2003.\n\nSpecial Public Prosecutor Bhavani Singh said a sum of Rs 10 crore has been", "article_metadata": {"description": "Verdict will also force Jayalalithaa to step down as the Tamil Nadu chief minister.", "author": "PTI", "og": {"site_name": "The Financial Express", "description": "Verdict will also force Jayalalithaa to step down as the Tamil Nadu chief minister.", "title": "Jayalalithaa found guilty in disproportionate assets case; verdict assigns 4-year jail term, fine of Rs 100 crore", "url": "http://archive.financialexpress.com/news/jayalalithaa-found-guilty-in-disproportionate-assets-case-verdict-assigns-4year-jail-term-fine-of-rs-100-crore/1293419", "image": "http://static.financialexpress.com/pic/uploadedImages/mediumImages/M_Id_483002_Jayalalithaa.jpg", "type": "article"}, "Last-Modified": "Sat Sep 27 2014. 22:09 hrs", "keywords": "jayalalithaa, jayalalithaa case, jayalalithaa case verdict, jayalalithaa disproportionate assets, jayalalithaa disproportionate assets case, J Jayalalithaa, disproportionate assets case, Tamil Nadu, Tamil Nadu news", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Jayalalithaa found guilty in disproportionate assets case; verdict assigns 4-year jail term, fine of Rs 100 crore\",\r\n                \"link\": \"http://archive.financialexpress.com/news/jayalalithaa-found-guilty-in-disproportionate-assets-case-verdict-assigns-4year-jail-term-fine-of-rs-100-crore/1293419\",\r\n                \"image_url\": \"http://static.financialexpress.com/pic/uploadedImages/mediumImages/M_Id_483002_Jayalalithaa.jpg\",\r\n                \"type\": \"post\",\r\n                \"post_id\": \"1293419\",\r\n                \"pub_date\": \"2014-09-27T22:09:02+05:30\",\r\n                \"section\": \"FE editor\\", "news_keywords": "jayalalithaa, jayalalithaa case, jayalalithaa case verdict, jayalalithaa disproportionate assets, jayalalithaa disproportionate assets case, J Jayalalithaa, disproportionate assets case, Tamil Nadu, Tamil Nadu news"}, "article_summary": "The Rs 100 crore fine is the highest imposed on any politician by the special judge who heard the case of Rs 66.65 crore disproportionate assets acquired during her first term as Chief Minister between 1991 and 1996.\nSpecial Public Prosecutor Bhavani Singh said a sum of Rs 10 crore has been\nSince they have been sentenced to a term of more than three years, they have been lodged in the Central Jail in Parappana Agrahara.\nThe Directorate of Vigilance and Anti-corruption had filed a charge sheet in the case which was transferred to the court here in 2003.\nThey can apply for bail only from Karnataka High Court which is on vacation till October 6 for Dasara."}
