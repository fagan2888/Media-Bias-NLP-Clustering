Tim\u2019s blog post is the most recent of many that explain why Obamacare\u2019s taxes are unconstitutional, but we\u2019ve always maintained that it would take the \u201cSupremes\u201d to resolve the issue. The lengthy and heated debate among the judges on the full DC Circuit regarding the panel\u2019s original opinion and alternative resolution reinforces that conclusion.\n\nTim also touched on the administration\u2019s main tactic to deflect attention from the litigation: to decla re the debate \u201cover\u201d regarding whether the misnamed Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) is \u201cthe law of the land.\u201d The White House desperately wants Americans to accept Obamacare and learn to like it. But try as it might, Obamacare\u2019s disastrous policies and the administration\u2019s questionable implementation justify American\u2019s continued rejection of the law.\n\nReaders should visit PLF\u2019s new Obamacare case page that includes our FAQs on the case, an updated legal backgrounder, op-eds, news stories and the like. Among them is a link to my recent Forbes piece that attempts to dispel ten Obamacare litigation myths and some of the general cynicism about Sissel v. HHS and similar Obamacare challenges.\n\nInside the Beltway and among some legal elites, Obamacare litigation fatigue is palpable. And yet, PLF\u2019s filing and press conference on Monday received extraordinary coverage, with over 1000 TV, print, and radio stories, including coverage by the Associated Press, RealClearPolitics, SCOTUSblog, at least five national radio networks with hundreds of stations each, and the major TV networks and the leading daily newspapers. In short, the cynicism among the elites does not seem to be shared by those who have the most to lose with Obamacare.\n\nBelow are two of the myths that I \u201cbust\u201d in the Forbes piece. The Beltway types can retain their cynicism about all things (it\u2019s part of what they market), but there is no easy way for the Supreme Court to avoid passing on major constitutional problems with a law as significant as Obamacare.\n\nMyth #3: With two high-profile saves \u2026 \u201c[the ACA] is here to stay!\u201d That\u2019s a nice slogan if you are an Obamacare booster, but it\u2019s still just wishful thinking. One party\u2019s challenge on certain issues doesn\u2019t preclude all other claims. The fact is that complex, lengthy and sloppy statutes generate more challenges. Obamacare is about as lengthy, complex, and radical in its transformation of a major industry as it comes. It was also carelessly drafted and forced through Congress before almost anyone could read it. The Supreme Court has been resolving ordinary Medicare and Medicaid cases that the lower courts disagree on for over 50 years; Obamacare is far more complex. It will spawn major lawsuits for as long as it is on the books. Myth #4: All the important constitutional challenges to Obamacare have been resolved by now This is a variant of myth #3, and it fails for related reasons. Some provisions of Obamacare didn\u2019t or don\u2019t become effective until 2014, 2016, 2017, and 2018. The Goldwater Institute\u2019s worthy challenge to the Independent Payment Advisory Board was held (wrongly in my view) not to be ripe until 2017. Matt Sissel\u2019s challenge, that the individual mandate \u201ctax\u201d violates the Origination Clause because it did not originate in the House, arose only after the Supreme Court ruled in 2012 that the mandate penalty was a tax (recall Obama denied it was a tax for years). Beyond that, landmark rulings interpreting many statutes occur decades after passage. The Supreme Court struck down the one-house veto provision in an immigration statute (and over 160 other statues) when Jagdish Chadha prevailed in his challenge 21 years after the immigration provision was enacted and many years after the other 160 statutes were passed.\n\nWhether the Supreme Court takes Sissel or a later case, Obamacare is equally unconstitutional. Because the DC Circuit panel confirmed Matt Sissel has standing to bring an Origination Clause challenge to the individual mandate \u201ctax,\u201d wouldn\u2019t it be better for everyone (including the government that insists there is no reason to worry) for the justices to decide the issue this term of Court?
