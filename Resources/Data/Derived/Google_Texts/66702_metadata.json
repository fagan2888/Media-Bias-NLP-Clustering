Let\u2019s not kid ourselves: We do have an urgent problem on our hands, but it\u2019s not Social Security. Millions of middle-class Americans are facing a retirement crisis as a result of inadequate income and growing wealth inequality. Social Security isn\u2019t the problem. It\u2019s an essential part of the solution.\n\nHow did this crisis develop? There was a time when traditional corporate pension plans paid a fixed income after retirement, but today only one in five working Americans has that kind of plan.\n\nToday many households live from paycheck to paycheck, according to surveys, and more than half of all Americans have less than $10,000 in savings. How can people save for retirement under these conditions? Economists used to describe retirement security as a \u201cthree-legged stool\u201d made up of savings, employee pensions and Social Security. With two of those legs cut off, why are some politicians sawing away at the third?\n\nThe truth is that Social Security is a success story. Without it, nearly half of seniors, and 1 million children, would be living in poverty today. It\u2019s financially self-sufficient, forbidden by law from adding to the federal deficit, and its operating costs are far below those of private-sector retirement plans.\n\nSo why are politicians trying to undermine public trust in it? Because we have another crisis on our hands: a crisis of democracy. Unfortunately, some politicians would rather respond to the concerns of the wealthy and powerful than address the needs of the middle class. That\u2019s not surprising, of course, since our campaign finance system encourages it.\n\nTo be fair, not all of the opposition is cynical. Some politicians have an ideological problem with Social Security, because they hate government. Social Security is a government program that works very well and is extremely popular with the public. That threatens their philosophy \u2014 so they claim that it\u2019s \u201cgoing broke\u201d instead.\n\nThat\u2019s not true. The retirement trust fund has $2.8 trillion in surplus, enough to pay full benefits for 18 years (and three-quarters of benefits afterwards). Why not longer? In large part, because income inequality \u2014 the huge gap between rich and poor \u2014 has soared, hurting millions of Americans and all but wiping out the middle class.\n\nIncome inequality has also hurt Social Security\u2019s finances, by leaving most of the wealthiest Americans\u2019 earnings above the cut-off point for the payroll tax which funds it. A Wall Street CEO who makes $18 million per year pays no more in payroll tax than someone earning $118,000. If we had the same level of economic equality we enjoyed in 1983, the retirement trust find would have another $1.1 trillion on hand \u2014 and another 20 more years of solvency. Instead, that money has gone into the pockets of the wealthy.\n\nAmerica doesn\u2019t have a problem with \u201cgreedy geezers,\u201d to quote one Social Security adversary. It has a \u201cRobin Hood in Reverse\u201d problem, a problem with policies that take from working families and give to the rich.\n\nRepublicans would rather change the subject. They want to cut benefits to disabled Social Security recipients by 19 percent, rather than make a minor adjustment between Social Security\u2019s trust funds. Congress has made that adjustment 11 times, and is only blocking it now to create the false sense that Social Security has a funding problem. If they succeed, they will then look for Democrats to join them in a new \u201cgrand bargain\u201d that cuts retiree benefits.\n\nIt\u2019s time to address our real problem \u2014 the retirement crisis \u2014 instead. In that regard, I have reintroduced legislation that would apply the payroll tax to earned income above $250,000 as well as investment income. This would allow us not only to increase benefits to meet the elderly\u2019s higher living expenses, but to extend Social Security\u2019s solvency until 2065.\n\nThat\u2019s sensible, practical \u2014 and fair. It asks those who have benefited most from wealth inequality to pay their proper share of payroll taxes. It\u2019s what the public wants, too, according to the polls.\n\nSome millionaires won\u2019t want to do that, of course, which raises the question: Does our government exist to serve wealthy campaign contributors, or the people in whose name it governs? Congress can answer that question \u2014 by listening to the American people who want to expand Social Security, not the Wall Street millionaires who want to cut it.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://wdhne.ws/1GThsuO", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Income inequality is our nation\u2019s \u2018crisis,\u2019 not needed entitlement programs.", "og": {"site_name": "Daily Herald Media", "description": "Income inequality is our nation\u2019s \u2018crisis,\u2019 not needed entitlement programs.", "title": "Bernie Sanders: Don\u2019t cut Social Security, expand it", "url": "http://www.wausaudailyherald.com/story/opinion/columnists/2015/05/04/bernie-sanders-cut-social-security-expand/26739913/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/wausaudailyherald.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Income inequality is our nation\u2019s \u2018crisis,\u2019 not needed entitlement programs.", "title": "Bernie Sanders: Don\u2019t cut Social Security, expand it", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9b2b573fe0cefa94dbf62ef2dffbeae373279fd3/c=597-0-2984-2387&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/05/01/Wausau/B9317195731Z.1_20150501192050_000_GQVALQRMN.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@wausauherald", "site": "@wausauherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=884268453", "fb": {"app_id": 187427251271455}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "article_summary": "Economists used to describe retirement security as a \u201cthree-legged stool\u201d made up of savings, employee pensions and Social Security.\nCongress can answer that question \u2014 by listening to the American people who want to expand Social Security, not the Wall Street millionaires who want to cut it.\nThey want to cut benefits to disabled Social Security recipients by 19 percent, rather than make a minor adjustment between Social Security\u2019s trust funds.\nSocial Security is a government program that works very well and is extremely popular with the public.\nLet\u2019s not kid ourselves: We do have an urgent problem on our hands, but it\u2019s not Social Security."}
