I appreciate you having me.\n\nJames West: Chris, what is the value proposition for investors in Nobilis Health Corp?\n\nChris Lloyd: Well, I think it\u2019s important to point out that Nobilis is probably more like its competitors than it is dislike its competitors. We\u2019re playing in a, or competing in a, vibrant and growing health care arena in the US. Where we set ourselves apart from the competition is that for some case volume. And again, we\u2019re all for having surgeries in our ORs arena; we control our own destiny more than our competitors do, and what I mean by that is, for some percentage, anywhere between 20 and 25 percent of our annual case volume, those cases will be directed to our centres via direct consumer marketing initiatives, whereby we are helping affiliated physicians grow their practices with the hopes that they will then refer surgical candidates to our facilities. And again, that differs slightly from our competitors in that almost all of their case volume is 100 percent dependent upon referrals from physician-owners\u2019 practices. And that\u2019s really what sets us apart.\n\nJames West: Okay. So what\u2019s the size of the market you\u2019re pursuing, and how much of that do you plan to capture in the next couple of years?\n\nChris Lloyd: Well, the market \u2013 we are probably a year to two years away from health care being the largest component of the US GDP. Right now, energy is, but we\u2019ve got 80 million Baby Boomers who are about to hit the period in their lives where historically people have consumed most of their health care dollars. So in very short order, it\u2019s going to be the largest part, or a couple of trillion dollars a year, in US GDP.\n\nSo in terms of what we\u2019re grabbing, it\u2019s miniscule. Even if you break that down to some of our core markets in Dallas and/or Houston, Texas, you\u2019re talking about, by some estimates, just in Texas, 22,000 physicians and surgeons, of which we\u2019re working with two or three hundred. So it\u2019s a very, very small market. I can break it down another way and say that there\u2019s approximately 6,000, give or take, surgery centres in the United States; about 60 percent plus are owned by individual physician partnerships, so very, very fragmented. We kind of lump ASD surgery centres and surgical hospitals into the same basket for purposes of this discussion.\n\nSo we want to go in and take advantage of this fragmented market and as we do, even at that point, if we end up with a couple of hundred facilities, which would be enormous growth for us, you\u2019re still kind of a rounding error. I spoke a lot, but I guess what I would say is, we\u2019re competing in a gigantic marketplace that is still growing quite quickly.\n\nJames West: Boy, I\u2019ll say. Okay. So what\u2019s the financial condition of the company presently? You know, cash on hand, revenue per quarter, profitability, EBITDA, rate of growth, etcetera?\n\nChris Lloyd: We\u2019re very, very healthy financially. We have somewhere around $20 million sitting on the balance sheet right now; we are about to hit our cash collection portion of our year. Generally, since the fourth quarter for us is far and away the busiest time of the year, and that\u2019s because people with commercial insurance plans are largely through their deductibles and co-payments, they\u2019re scrambling to have any big ticket items done before the end of the year, when their deductible will re-set for next year.\n\nSo really seasonal like that, so what happens is, our collection cycle is, our days outstanding is, call it, between 90 and 100 days, so we\u2019re really busy in October, November, December, and we collect that cash starting in February, March, and on into April. So you should see us absent, holding all things constant, actually adding cash to the balance sheet in short order. Relative to our peers, we\u2019re very under-levered, compared to what we expect to do for 2015 on an EBITDA basis, we\u2019re less than \u00bd times, \u00bd turns levered; a lot of our peers are levered at 5 or 6 times. So there\u2019s a lot of dry powder there for additional leverage, should we need it.\n\nFrom a margin standpoint, on the net margin basis, again, we are probably closer to our competitors than you would expect, because we don\u2019t take government pay at most of our facilities, and because we\u2019re focused on higher reimbursing procedures, the obvious conclusion would be oh, these guys are going to have margins way in excess of our peers. And at the gross margin level, on a percentage basis, we do have better margins than most of our peers. However, we have this big marketing expense line that our peers don\u2019t have, so at the net level, we end up kind of where they are, in the 18 to 21 percent net or EBITDA basis as a percentage of revenue.\n\nJames West: Hmm. Okay. Interesting. So with all that dry powder, do you have any plans or necessity to raise equity or debt capital in the near future?\n\nChris Lloyd: Absent doing an acquisition, I don\u2019t think so. Again, we\u2019re going to put cash on the balance sheet over the next few months, and so even if we go off and we buy one or two new centres on a one-off basis, we can largely purchase those through debt and cash on hand, and using our stock. The only way that I think we would be raising additional debt or equity would be in connection with a large acquisition, and at that point obviously it would have to be a very accretive transaction or we wouldn\u2019t consider it.\n\nJames West: Okay. So then who are your biggest competitors in the space, and how much of a threat are they to you, or you to them?\n\nChris Lloyd: Well, it\u2019s interesting. Right now when you look, go back to my earlier comment about the 6,000 give or take ASCs, the players in it\u2026there\u2019s four or five really big players, and those include Amsurg Corp (NASDAQ:AMSG), they include the ambulatory division of HCA, it includes Surgical Care Affiliates Inc. (NASDAQ:SCAI), it includes the newly public Surgery Partners Inc. (NASDAQ:SGRY) \u2026those are all some of the really big players. I\u2019d be remiss if I didn\u2019t mention USPI, which is now a division of Tenet Healthcare Corp (NYSE:THC) here in Dallas. They\u2019re the big players, and between them, they probably own a good percentage of the remaining 40 percent of the fragmented industry I talked about earlier.\n\nHowever, we don\u2019t run into them that often, either when we\u2019re looking at assets, or when we\u2019re recruiting physicians and trying to build our existing facilities, just because they\u2019re so big and their strategy is slightly different in that their focus, they generally have a high government pay percentage; we don\u2019t take government pay. They\u2019re looking at higher volume types of case providers, so a lot of endoscopy, a lot of ophthalmology, and those are two specialities that we tend to not have at our facilities.\n\nSo when we\u2019re looking at buying facilities, HCA, they\u2019re generally not looking to buy one-off ASCs. They just can\u2019t devote the energy to it. Whereas for us, if we buy two or three ASCs in a year, that can really move the needle.\n\nSo while we aspire to their size, we don\u2019t run into them a lot on day-to-day operations or on M&A competition.\n\nJames West: So how was the company founded, and whose idea was it?\n\nChris Lloyd: Okay. Well, Nobilis came about when Norstar, which was a kind of legacy facilities company, purchased Athas, which was the legacy direct consumer marketing company. And Norstar was founded back in 2007 by a group of physicians that owned some facilities down in Houston, Texas. It\u2019s kind of lived through a couple of evolutions. It started in \u201907, kind of didn\u2019t work great, kind of went quite for a couple of years, and then back in 2010, a new group of management came in and started everything up again, and really had a great track record of growth.\n\nAthas was started back in late 2008, early 2009, with a single brand, and then it grew over the years to have multiple brands and was just having some really good success in this direct consumer marketing space. And Norstar had a desire to get serious about the direct consumer play, because they noticed that sort of macro-evolution in the US health care markets. So they bought Athas back in December of 2014, almost a year ago as we speak.\n\nJames West: You became involved how?\n\nChris Lloyd: I was the CEO and one of the founders of Athas, and when Norstar bought us, they made me CEO of the combined company.\n\nJames West: Sure. Okay, Chris, in the interests of time, let\u2019s jump to the Part II of this interview, and we\u2019re going to talk a bit about the Anson lawsuit that you\u2019ve launched relative to the Emperor Has No Clothes Seeking Alpha commentary where you\u2019ve been attacked by a short seller whose identity is essentially anonymous, and he\u2019s suggesting that Nobilis has various issues that make it overvalued. And what is the company\u2019s position on that?\n\nChris Lloyd: Well, we issued a direct response right after it came out and posted on the website. Our Board of Directors then engaged outside counsel to do an independent investigation to dig into the claims that were made on the Seeking Alpha blog post. They came back unequivocally and said the post was full of dubious claims, unsubstantiated claims, claims generally designed to hurt the stock price in the interest of helping a short-seller.\n\nSo we continue to say, even though we think we\u2019re hopefully moving past the Seeking Alpha time in our life, we continue to say that there was a lot of just flat-out lies in that post, and then there was a lot of innuendo and sort of misdirection that was used to benefit people and confuse investors that just didn\u2019t really know any better. So as we continue to execute on our business model, the truth continues to come out, and investors are going to see that there\u2019s a lot of falsities that were put into that blog post.\n\nJames West: Sure. So the big fear amongst investors is that this becomes a major distraction for management, and you know, there\u2019s some people drawing a correlation that the late filing of third quarter financials is somehow related, and I see that that\u2019s hurting your share price. But I don\u2019t concur with that sort of assessment, having heard your explanation on the call last week. But how much of a distraction are you willing to let this lawsuit become for Nobilis?\n\nChris Lloyd: It\u2019s not going to be. We have outside attorneys who are handling this. The moment it becomes either too expensive, or too much of a distraction, we\u2019ll step out of it. That\u2019s just, right now, we do feel a fiduciary and moral obligation to the shareholders that were hurt by something that they shouldn\u2019t have been hurt by. If there had been something amiss with the company and the Seeking Alpha post had pointed it out, then okay, we understand. But that wasn\u2019t the case. So we feel like we need to do our best to protect shareholders\u2019 interests, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing, and again, once it becomes too expensive or too much of a distraction, we\u2019ll move on.\n\nJames West: Sure. How did Anson get involved with Nobilis in the first place?\n\nChris Lloyd: I personally met with them earlier this year; they presented themselves as a potential long shareholder, and then from there, I didn\u2019t hear from them again until it was brought to our attention that they were the ones likely behind \u2013 or possibly behind, the blog post.\n\nJames West: So they misrepresented their intentions in their first meeting?\n\nChris Lloyd: Well, they certainly didn\u2019t come in and say hey, we\u2019re a short seller who likes to write articles and drive prices down and benefit that way. No, they didn\u2019t say one way or the other, but they certainly acted like they were interested in a long position in our stock.\n\nJames West: Okay. So what evidence leads you to believe that the Seeking Alpha writer of the Emperor Has No Clothes, is in fact colluding with Anson, possibly, and other parties, to hurt your share price?\n\nChris Lloyd: Well, I can\u2019t get into the details; it\u2019s ongoing, and it\u2019s in the hands of the courts and the lawyers at this point. But I will say that we heard it from multiple sources, and then we undertook our own internal investigation to figure out who the culprits were.\n\nJames West: Okay. Well, that\u2019s great, Chris. I really appreciate you taking the time. Thank you.\n\nChris Lloyd: Hey, I appreciate the time.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Midas Letter | Canadian and U.S. Business News, Investing, and Commentary", "description": "Nobilis Health Corp (TSE:NHC)(NYSEMKT:HLTH) CEO Chris Lloyd says negative comments published by an anonymous blogger who his company alleges is working in concert with Anson Funds to drive down the company\u2019s share price are false.
