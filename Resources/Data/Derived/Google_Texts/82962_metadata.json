But the early Twitter consensus has not been enthusiastic.\n\nLong wait times for vets? VA secretary says that's the wrong question.\n\nA man looks over the Affordable Care Act signup page on the HealthCare.gov website in New York October 2, 2013.\n\nIt\u2019s true: The federal government is using the Doge Internet meme to promote Obamacare. This is likely to be the most confounding and/or controversial means of pushing younger people to enroll in health insurance via the Affordable Care Act since \u201cPajama Boy.\u201d\n\nRemember Pajama Boy? The glasses-wearing semi-hipster wearing a plaid onesie and sipping hot chocolate in an ad that promoted talking about getting health coverage? A few people thought it was clever. Many did not.\n\nOK, back to Doge. On Wednesday afternoon, the Health and Human Services' Twitter feed pushed out a tweet featuring a photo of a Shiba Inu dog playing in the snow.\n\nRecommended: How much do you know about health-care reform? Take our quiz!\n\nIn crayon script over the photo was written, \u201cSo health insurance. Very benefits. Wow. Many coverage. Much affordable. Such HealthCare.gov.\u201d\n\nThis mimics Doge, a meme on Tumblr in which introspective-looking Shiba Inus are depicted with a dog-brain-level interior monologue, such as, \u201cWow. Who am I? Such unsure. So much mystery.\u201d\n\nNote: We fully realize that by describing this, we have sucked all joy and art from the process. It\u2019s like explaining why a joke is funny, a process never funny in itself. But this is explanatory journalism, so give us a break.\n\nObviously, HHS is trying to push enrollment in health insurance among young people as Obamacare\u2019s final deadline for 2014 coverage approaches. Younger people are generally healthier, and the more of them sign up, the better balanced insurance risk pools will be. And what better way to advertise to the wired Gen Y than on the Internet where they live? With the same memes they use?\n\nThat would work if it did not come across like George Will quoting Arcade Fire. On Twitter, the immediate early consensus about the Doge meme and HHS was simple: \u201cmake it stop.\u201d\n\nHHS \u201cused the recently revived, three-year-old meme to flog Obamacare on Wednesday, which hopefully means that by Thursday, we\u2019ll all sort of silently agree it\u2019s over,\u201d writes New York Magazine\u2019s Adam Martin.\n\nOthers pointed out that anyone who has never encountered Doge will be mystified.\n\n\u201cWhen cable news picks up the @HHSGov Doge, it\u2019s going to strike a lot of people who have never seen Doge as confusing and idiotic. #backfire,\u201d tweeted Politico media columnist Dylan Byers on Wednesday.\n\nThere are a couple of further points on this subject worth mentioning. One is that HHS and its associated marketers might be cleverer than it seems on the surface. This could be back-flip marketing, in which messages are passed along by people making fun of them.\n\nAfter all, lots of people made fun of Pajama Boy. But every joke mentioned \u201csigning up for Obamacare\u201d right alongside.\n\nAnd finally, this isn\u2019t the first time Doge and Washington have collided. Politicians have been doing Doge posts for some time, as The Huffington Post reported in December.\n\nA post by Rep. Tom Massie (R) of Kentucky criticizing last year\u2019s budget deal is typical: \u201cMuch bipartisanship. Very spending. Wow.\u201d\n\nSo if this meme is one whose intellectual purity has been sullied by politics, that\u2019s something that occurred some time ago.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.content.id": "91493a61134e98c90d67c5e5a95ad2a6", "sailthru.author": "Peter Grier", "description": "The Health and Human Services Department is using the Doge Internet meme to promote Obamacare among younger people.
