A video featuring \"Whose Line Is It Anyway\" host Aisha Tyler was released Tuesday as part of the campaign to encourage young people to sign up for health care.\n\nView the video above.\n\nThe marathon event comes after a Monday enrollment report revealed that young, healthy Americans are seeking coverage at a much lower rate than President Barack Obama's administration initially projected. According to the report, less than a quarter of the 2.2 million Americans enrolled in Obamacare are between the ages of 18 and 34; the administration expected 38 percent of enrollees to be within that age range.\n\nCORRECTION: This post has been updated to note the event on Thursday is six hours, not eight. Language has also been added to indicate that some of the celebrities will not appear in person.\n\n\n\nAlso on HuffPost: Obama With Celebrities Obama With Celebrities\n\n1 of 10 George Clooney & President Obama Actor George Clooney leaves after he spoke to the media March 15, 2012 at the White House in Washington, DC.
