Via Time Magazine:\n\nLaw-enforcement officers\u2019 duties bring them into contact with the drug-addled on a daily basis, so the proliferation of dangerous drugs directly affects their lives and families more than it might affect yours or mine. And while Breaking Bad may not glorify meth in the sense of making it attractive to the average viewer, it does normalize the idea of meth for a broad segment of society that might otherwise have no knowledge of that dark and dangerous world.\n\n\n\nBefore Breaking Bad, relatively few people knew someone whose life had been touched by meth, but now millions more people have an intense emotional connection with at least two: Walter White and Jesse Pinkman. And suddenly, for those spellbound viewers, the idea of people using meth is a little less foreign, a little more familiar. And that false sense of familiarity is inherently dangerous.\n\nEwing stresses that he\u2019s not arguing in favor of censorship in the name of public safety, but that \u201csometimes great art affects culture negatively,\u201d suggesting that some \u201cpeople on the margins of society\u201d will certainly be attracted to the use of meth by the show. That idea seems ridiculous. It\u2019s doubtful people \u201con the margins\u201d will be any more interested in being like Skinny Pete or Wendy, or even Jesse Pinkman. Notably, the main character Walter White only uses drugs once through the run of the show but is probably the most loathsome character in the Breaking Bad world.\n\nEwing\u2019s assumptions about people on the margins of society is illustrative of the attitude law enforcement takes toward a population it considers more an enemy than people who should also be served and protected. Meth became the media\u2019s drug panic of choice years ago, before Breaking Bad ever premiered, and, more importantly, crystal meth would likely never have become a recreational drug in the first place if it weren\u2019t for the drug war increasing the costs of safer alternatives.\n\nMore Reason on meth here, and watch Reason TV\u2019s \u201cThe Real Breaking Bad: How the Drug War Creates Collateral Damage\u201d below:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Really?", "title": "Breaking Bad Normalizes Idea of Meth, Draws Margins of Society In, Prosecutor Argues", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2013/09/20/breaking-bad-normalizes-idea-of-meth-dra", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/1379687938645.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Blake\nEwing, an assistant district attorney near Austin, Texas, penned an\nopinion piece explaining why he thinks the AMC television show\nBreaking Bad, about a cancer-stricken chemistry teacher\nturned meth cook and kingpin normalizes the use of meth and makes\nthe police\u2019s job harder. \nVia Time Magazine:\nLaw-enforcement officers\u2019 duties bring them into\ncontact with the drug-addled on a dai", "title": "<em>Breaking Bad</em> Normalizes Idea of Meth, Draws Margins of Society In, Prosecutor Argues", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/1379687938645.jpg", "creator": "@edkrayewski", "site": "@reason", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "article": {"tag": "Nanny State", "published_time": "2013-09-20T14:40:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/ed-krayewski"}, "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "article_summary": "More Reason on meth here, and watch Reason TV\u2019s \u201cThe Real Breaking Bad: How the Drug War Creates Collateral Damage\u201d below:\nNotably, the main character Walter White only uses drugs once through the run of the show but is probably the most loathsome character in the Breaking Bad world.\nAnd suddenly, for those spellbound viewers, the idea of people using meth is a little less foreign, a little more familiar.\nBefore Breaking Bad, relatively few people knew someone whose life had been touched by meth, but now millions more people have an intense emotional connection with at least two: Walter White and Jesse Pinkman.\nBlake Ewing, an assistant district attorney near Austin, Texas, penned an opinion piece explaining why he thinks the AMC television show Breaking Bad, about a cancer-stricken chemistry teacher turned meth cook and kingpin normalizes the use of meth and makes the police\u2019s job harder."}
