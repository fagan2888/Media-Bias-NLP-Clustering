Officers arrested Anna Olander, but said she has not revealed anything about the other chase suspect who is still on the run.

Norman Police released the name of a female suspect arrested after a stolen vehicle investigation that turned into a high speed chase.

Officers arrested Anna Olander, but said she has not revealed anything about the other chase suspect who is still on the run.

"She didn't tell us the identity of this other fella, but she gave us some information, including that she had been with him all night and she knew that the vehicle was stolen," Norman Police Captain Tom Easley said.

Moore police sent out an alert around 5:15 a.m. Tuesday about a stolen pickup taken from a convenience store in Moore.

Norman officers saw the truck and an SUV following closely behind.

They tried to pull the truck over, but both vehicles took off and a high-speed pursuit ensued.

The male suspect ditched the truck on a dead-end street and ran off.

"He's still at large," said Captain Easley. "We don't know his identity yet; we'll figure it out, just a matter of time."

Officers said Olander was driving the SUV and eventually hit another vehicle near the Riverwind Casino.

She crashed into a muddy field, and police said the SUV turned out to be stolen too.

"They're probably professional or semi-professional in that there was some other stolen property from another Oklahoma City auto burglary found in one of the vehicles," Captain Easley added.

Police said the owner of the vehicle stolen in Moore left his gun inside.

They said it looked like the suspect may have tried to use it at some point, but he did not get any shots off because the gun jammed.
