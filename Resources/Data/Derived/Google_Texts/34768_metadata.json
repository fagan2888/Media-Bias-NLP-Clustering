The standards were developed and are being implemented by states, though Common Core opponents argue that President Barack Obama\u2019s administration has encouraged adoption of the standards by various parameters it set for states applying to get lucrative federal education grants.\n\nTea party-aligned officials and candidates want to delay the standards or abandon them altogether in at least a dozen of the 45 states that adopted some part of the guidelines. Indiana lawmakers approved a repeal that now awaits a decision from Gov. Mike Pence.\n\n\u201cCommon Core is like Obamacare: They passed it before they knew what was in it,\u201d said William Evers, a Hoover Institute research fellow and lead author of a California Republican Party resolution denouncing Common Core.\n\nTo a lesser extent, Democrats must deal with some teachers \u2014 their unions hold strong influence within the party \u2014 who are upset about implementation details. But it\u2019s the internal GOP debate that\u2019s on display in statehouses, across 2014 campaigns and among 2016 presidential contenders.\n\nThe flap continues as students in 36 states and the District of Columbia begin this week taking field tests of new assessments based on the standards, although the real tests won\u2019t be given for another year.\n\nPaul, a Republican senator from Kentucky, has joined seven colleagues, including Texas\u2019 Cruz, to sponsor a measure that would bar federal financing of any Common Core component. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio isn\u2019t among the eight, but he had already come out against the standards. So has Rick Santorum, a 2012 presidential candidate mulling another run.\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum is Bush, the former Florida governor and Rubio\u2019s mentor. \u201cThis is a real-world, grown-up approach to a real crisis that we have, and it\u2019s been mired in politics,\u201d Bush said last week in Tennessee, where he joined Republican Gov. Bill Haslam at an event to promote Common Core.\n\nHaslam, who is running for re-election this year, is trying to beat back a repeal effort in the Tennessee legislature. \u201cThese are simply guidelines that say a fourth grader should be learning the same things\u201d regardless of where the student lives, the governor said recently. \u201cHistorically, we haven\u2019t been good at setting high standards.\u201d\n\nThe National Governors Association and state education superintendents developed Common Core. Among other things, the framework recommends when students should master certain skills. For example, by the end of fifth grade, a math student should be able to graph and solve complex problems by plotting points on x and y axes. A high school sophomore should be able to analyze text or make written arguments using valid logical reasoning and sufficient evidence.\n\nThe issue presents a delicate balancing act for some governors. Bobby Jindal\u2019s Louisiana and Scott Walker\u2019s Wisconsin initially adopted the new standards. Now both men \u2014 possible presidential candidates \u2014 must watch as GOP lawmakers in their states push anti-Common Core bills. Jindal, who was an NGA member during Common Core\u2019s development, told the Baton Rouge Press Club earlier this year that he\u2019s \u201cabsolutely for rigorous standards\u201d but \u201cabsolutely against any kind of federal takeover.\u201d Before Wisconsin lawmakers convened, Walker announced support for rethinking Common Core. In both states, however, the anti-Common Core legislation appears stalled, as neither governor has made repeal a priority.\n\nEstablishment Republicans in Georgia, meanwhile, derailed a repeal effort in favor of a \u201cstudy commission\u201d empowered only to make recommendations. Alabama GOP leaders have held off a repeal measure, as well.\n\nImmediate political consequences of the disputes aren\u2019t clear. GOP officials and strategists say any fallout for them is dwarfed by Democrats\u2019 struggle with Obama\u2019s health care law. In the meantime, conservative candidates use Common Core as a symbolic rallying cry.\n\nTennessee state Rep. Joe Carr, a long-shot primary challenger to Republican Sen. Lamar Alexander, insists Common Core \u201cis just one more overreach of a federal government that wants to insert itself into everything.\u201d An Alabama congressional hopeful, Scott Beason, casts Common Core as liberal indoctrination. In Georgia\u2019s crowded Republican U.S. Senate primary, Rep. Paul Broun declared in a recent debate, \u201cI want to abolish the Department of Education and get rid of Common Core forever.\u201d His first goal wouldn\u2019t necessarily accomplish the second.\n\nThe arguments perplex the politicians most responsible for the plan.\n\nDemocrat Jack Markell, Delaware\u2019s second-term governor, told the Associated Press that opponents mistakenly equate a coalition from across the nation with a federal government initiative. Markell co-chaired NGA\u2019s Common Core panel with Republican Sonny Perdue of Georgia.\n\nPerdue, who left office in 2011, said Common Core actually began as a pushback against federal influence because of the No Child Left Behind law, the national education act signed by President George W. Bush. Perdue said it was \u201cembarrassing\u201d for governors of both parties that Congress and the White House pushed higher standards before state leaders.\n\nPerdue attributes the outcry against Common Core to Obama\u2019s backing: \u201cThere is enough paranoia coming out of Washington, I can understand how some people would believe these rumors of a \u2018federal takeover,\u2019 try as you might to persuade people otherwise. I almost think it was detrimental \u2026 for the president to endorse it.\u201d\n\nEvers, the Hoover Institute fellow who was also a top Education Department appointee during the Bush administration, says it\u2019s unfair to reduce opponents\u2019 concerns to partisanship. He notes insufficient training for teachers expected to use new teaching methods, and he criticizes specific components. For example, some math courses are recommended for later grade levels than in standards already adopted in leading states like Massachusetts and California.\n\nStates move forward, Evers argued, because of competition. \u201cIt\u2019s by emulation and rivalry that we have always seen advances in public education,\u201d he said. National standards, he added, \u201cwill close the door on innovation.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "More than five years after U.S. governors began a bipartisan effort to set new standards in American schools, the Common Core initiative has morphed into a political tempest fueling division among Republicans.", "pubdate": 20140324, "og": {"site_name": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "More than five years after U.S. governors began a bipartisan effort to set new standards in American schools, the Common Core initiative has morphed into a political tempest fueling division among Republicans.", "title": "Republican governors wrestle with unpopular Common Core education standards", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/184438371.jpg", "url": "http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/republican-governors-wrestle-unpopular-common-core-education-standards/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "More than five years after U.S. governors began a bipartisan effort to set new standards in American schools, the Common Core initiative has morphed into a political tempest fueling division among Republicans.", "title": "Republican governors wrestle with unpopular Common Core education standards", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/184438371.jpg", "creator": "@newshour", "site": "@newshour", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "fb": {"app_id": 114150878604116}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/newshour", "tag": "tea party"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Common Core, eduation, education, governors, jindal, tea party"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbef9\"", "article_summary": "\u201cCommon Core is like Obamacare: They passed it before they knew what was in it,\u201d said William Evers, a Hoover Institute research fellow and lead author of a California Republican Party resolution denouncing Common Core.\n\u201cHistorically, we haven\u2019t been good at setting high standards.\u201dThe National Governors Association and state education superintendents developed Common Core.\nIn the meantime, conservative candidates use Common Core as a symbolic rallying cry.\nMarkell co-chaired NGA\u2019s Common Core panel with Republican Sonny Perdue of Georgia.\nBill Haslam at an event to promote Common Core."}
