Ray Ward, who met with the woman just before her death, said after hearing the news released late Friday by Gov. Gary Herbert and legislative leaders.\n\nWard, R-Bountiful, handed a note to House Speaker Greg Hughes, R-Draper, at last Wednesday's House Republican caucus meeting from Carol Frisby and informed him she had died after a battle with colon cancer.\n\nFrisby, who had been unable to afford the colonoscopy screening that may have detected her illness in time to treat it, had met privately with the speaker and appeared before the caucus to talk about the need for Medicaid expansion.\n\nWard, a doctor, is one of the few House Republicans who supported the governor's Healthy Utah alternative to the Medicaid expansion available under President Barack Obama's health care law. Healthy Utah failed in the 2015 Legislature.\n\nRelated Story\n\nHealth care ruling last hurdle for Medicaid expansion in Utah? Gov. Gary Herbert and four state legislative leaders have been working together on how to use the federal money available under the Affordable Care Act for Medicaid expansion to provide health care coverage to low-income Utahns.\n\nThe governor's response was to assemble the so-called Group of Six and charge them with coming up with an proposal by July 31. House Republicans were told a their meeting Wednesday that deadline would not be met.\n\nBut that changed after the group met later Wednesday. Their meeting was not announced and was closed to the press and the public, as have been all of their discussions.\n\nThey came to at least a conceptual agreement on two key issues: covering all of the Utahns eligible for Medicaid expansion and taxing hospitals and others in the medical community to pay for the state's share of the federal program's cost.\n\nThat would mean a new plan for spending hundreds of millions of dollars available to the state would provide health care to about 100,000 Utahns earning up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level.\n\nHouse Republicans had passed their own plan last session that would have provided only limited coverage to the 60,000 Utahns below the federal poverty level, those in what's called the coverage gap because they don't qualify for any federal subsidies.\n\nA progress report Thursday from one of the group's members, Sen. Brian Shiozawa, R-Cottonwood Heights, made at the Legislature's Health Reform Task Force did not mention an agreement, just that their efforts had been \"very productive.\"\n\nThe news release late Friday afternoon caught some off guard.\n\nHouse Majority Leader Jim Dunnigan, R-Taylorsville, was initially not aware an agreement had been announced. Later, he said the news release was not related to the negative media coverage from Wednesday's caucus meeting.\n\nFor me, it's not political. I was able to get to a point where I could envision a program that could work. \u2013House Majority Leader Jim Dunnigan\n\n\"We've been getting bad press for a long time, so really that's not much different,\" Dunnigan said. \"For me, it's not political. I was able to get to a point where I could envision a program that could work.\"\n\nThe majority leader said the group has now \"certainly met our July 31 deadline.\"\n\nBut Senate President Wayne Niederhauser, R-Sandy, said that deadline hasn't been met because it will take at least through August to finalize their version of Medicaid expansion.\n\n\"I want to emphasize that we've made substantial progress. We have a foundation now. Our future meetings will be now kind of putting the muscle on the skeleton,\" Niederhauser said. \"I wouldn't say it's a lot of work. I think we're on the tail end.\"\n\nThe Senate president said it's possible a proposal could be ready for a vote by lawmakers as soon as September. Herbert has said he will call a special session of the Legislature once it's done.\n\nThe governor said in a statement that \"there is still work to be done, but I believe we now have a framework in place that will provide care for Utahns most in need while being responsible with limited taxpayer funds.\"\n\nThe news release stated the group will meet with unnamed stakeholders and policymakers in the coming weeks, and once a formal draft is produced, public hearings through legislative committees will be held.\n\nThe Obama administration will also have to sign off on any plan.\n\nChris Karpowitz, co-director of BYU's Center for the Study of Elections and Democracy, said it's hard to know what to make of Friday's surprise announcement.\n\n\"Late Friday is typically the time when you release political news you really don't want anyone to be thinking about. So it's a little surprising an announcement of this magnitude, if it really is a major breakthrough, would be made on a Friday,\" he said.\n\nWhile Karpowitz said he didn't \"want to assign too much political motive\" to the announcement coming after Frisby's death, he said \"that sort of tragic and dramatic event could certainly be the catalyst for further work.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Stories\n\n0 Pending Comments", "article_metadata": {"description": "Just days after House Republicans heard a woman who had lobbied them for Medicaid expansion died after not getting the care she needed, state leaders have announced a conceptual framework on a new program.", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=363278608, app-argument=http://www.ksl.com/?nid=757&sid=35551188", "og": {"image": "http://img.ksl.com/slc/2550/255052/25505233.jpg?filter=ksl/responsive_story_lg", "type": "article", "description": "Just days after House Republicans heard a woman who had lobbied them for Medicaid expansion died after not getting the care she needed, state leaders have announced a conceptual framework on a new program.", "title": "State leaders announce 'conceptual framework' on Medicaid expansion | KSL.com"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kslcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "google-play-app": "app-id=com.ksl.android", "fb": {"pages": 68771464171}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 35551188}}, "theme-color": "#0b162f", "keywords": "news, traffic, weather, sports, classifieds, cars, jobs, homes, television, radio, salt lake, utah, local", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/kslcom/"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "SALT LAKE CITY \u2014 Just days after House Republicans heard a woman who had lobbied them for Medicaid expansion died after not getting the care she needed, state leaders have announced a \"conceptual framework\" on a new program.\n\"Late Friday is typically the time when you release political news you really don't want anyone to be thinking about.\nRelated StoryHealth care ruling last hurdle for Medicaid expansion in Utah?\nWard, a doctor, is one of the few House Republicans who supported the governor's Healthy Utah alternative to the Medicaid expansion available under President Barack Obama's health care law.\nBut Senate President Wayne Niederhauser, R-Sandy, said that deadline hasn't been met because it will take at least through August to finalize their version of Medicaid expansion."}
