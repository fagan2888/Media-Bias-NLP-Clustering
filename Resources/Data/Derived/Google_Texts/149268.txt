A teen is rushed to the hospital following a shooting at a house party in southeast Wichita.

Investigators say the shooting occured around 3:15 a.m. near Lincoln and Oliver. An 18-year-old woman was shot in the lower torso. Initially, her wounds were thought to be critical, but she has since been upgraded to fair condition. She is expected to survive.

Sgt. Kevin Kochenderfer said Wichita Police officers found about a dozen shell casings on the ground and many people on edge.

"The neighborhood was pretty shook up by all the fireworks to begin with," he said. "They've been calling all night. Then gunshots and people screaming. Other than that, everyone has been extremely cooperative on this block."

Kochenderfer said police are trying to find a vehicle that may have been struck by the gunfire. He did not provide a description.

He also said that a gunshot victim showed up at a Wichita hospital overnight. Police are looking to see if that person was connected to this shooting.
