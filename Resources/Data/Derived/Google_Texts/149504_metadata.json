Frohlich, Alexander Kent and Alexander E.M. Hess\n\n|\n\nBased on recently released Census Bureau data, women made up almost half of the workforce last year. Yet, even working full-time and year-round, they were paid only 79 cents for every dollar men made. The wage gap varies considerably between states. Women receive 86 cents for every dollar men make in New York, for example, while in Louisiana, women are paid just 66% of what men earn.\n\nIncome inequality is only one of the challenges women face. Across the nation, women are less likely to serve in leadership roles both in the private and public sectors. Health outcomes among female populations also vary considerably between states. Based on 24/7 Wall St.\u2019s analysis, Mississippi is the worst state for women in the nation.\n\nIn all of the worst rated states, women were less likely than their male peers to hold private sector management positions. In two of the worst states \u2014 South Dakota and Utah \u2014 women held fewer than one in three management jobs. According to Ariane Hegewisch, study director at the Institute for Women\u2019s Policy Research, women are discriminated not just in base pay, but also lack career opportunities available to men. \u201cA lot of [the wage gap] is also promotions, recruitments, and networking,\u201d Hegewisch said. Perceptions of performance can also be affected by gender, meaning \u201cthe more the pay is related to performance and bonuses, the bigger the wage gap.\u201d\n\nWomen in the worst rated states were also less likely to have leadership roles in government compared to women in the rest of the country. Only six of the 10 states had any female representation in Congress. Many of these states were among the nation\u2019s worst for female representation in their own state legislatures as well. State Senates usually have between 30 and 50 Senators. Of the 10 states on this list, however, only Kansas had more than 10 female senators.\n\nWhile the United States is among the most developed countries in the world, it was one of just a handful of nations where maternal mortality actually rose over the last decade, according to a recent study published in The Lancet, a respected medical journal. Pregnancy related mortality rates vary considerably between states.\n\nTo determine the worst states for women, 24/7 Wall St. developed on a methodology based on the Center for American Progress\u2019 2013 report, \u201cThe State of Women in America.\u201d\n\nWe divided a range of variables into three major categories: economy, leadership, and health. Data in the economy category came from the U.S. Census Bureau and included male and female median earnings, the percent of children enrolled in state pre-kindergarten, state spending per child enrolled in pre-kindergarten, and education attainment rates. The leadership category included data on the percent of women in management occupations from the Census. It also includes the share of state and federal legislators who are women, and states that currently have female governors. The health section incorporated Census data on the percent of women who were uninsured as well as life expectancy. Infant and maternal mortality rates came from the Kaiser Family Foundation. Data on the expansion of Medicaid, as policies towards maternity leave, sick days, and time off from work came from the National Partnership for Women and Families.\n\nState rankings on each of these measures were averaged to determine a score for each category. Possible scores ranged from 1 (best) to 50 (worst). The three category scores were averaged to create an indexed value that furnished our final ranking.\n\nThese are the five worst states for women.\n\nBing: Women in Congress\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The 5 Worst States for Women", "application-name": "The 5 Worst States for Women"}, "article_summary": "In all of the worst rated states, women were less likely than their male peers to hold private sector management positions.\nIn two of the worst states \u2014 South Dakota and Utah \u2014 women held fewer than one in three management jobs.\nThese are the five worst states for women.\nBased on 24/7 Wall St.\u2019s analysis, Mississippi is the worst state for women in the nation.\nTo determine the worst states for women, 24/7 Wall St. developed on a methodology based on the Center for American Progress\u2019 2013 report, \u201cThe State of Women in America.\u201dWe divided a range of variables into three major categories: economy, leadership, and health."}
