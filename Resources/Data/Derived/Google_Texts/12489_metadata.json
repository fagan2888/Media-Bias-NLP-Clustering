Instead, it triggered an internal class war. Can the party reconcile the demands of its donors with the interests of its rank and file?\n\nThe angriest and most pessimistic people in America aren\u2019t the hipster protesters who flitted in and out of Occupy Wall Street. They aren\u2019t the hashtavists of #BlackLivesMatter. They aren\u2019t the remnants of the American labor movement or the savvy young dreamers who confront politicians with their American accents and un-American legal status. The angriest and most pessimistic people in America are the people we used to call Middle Americans. Middle-class and middle-aged; not rich and not poor; people who are irked when asked to press 1 for English, and who wonder how white male became an accusation rather than a description. You can measure their pessimism in polls that ask about their expectations for their lives\u2014and for those of their children. On both counts, whites without a college degree express the bleakest view. You can see the effects of their despair in the new statistics describing horrifying rates of suicide and substance-abuse fatality among this same group, in middle age.\n\nWhite Middle Americans express heavy mistrust of every institution in American society: not only government, but corporations, unions, even the political party they typically vote for\u2014the Republican Party of Romney, Ryan, and McConnell, which they despise as a sad crew of weaklings and sellouts. They are pissed off. And when Donald Trump came along, they were the people who told the pollsters, \u201cThat\u2019s my guy.\u201d They aren\u2019t necessarily superconservative. They often don\u2019t think in ideological terms at all. But they do strongly feel that life in this country used to be better for people like them\u2014and they want that older country back. You hear from people like them in many other democratic countries too. Across Europe, populist parties are delivering a message that combines defense of the welfare state with skepticism about immigration; that denounces the corruption of parliamentary democracy and also the risks of global capitalism. Some of these parties have a leftish flavor, like Italy\u2019s Five Star Movement. Some are rooted to the right of center, like the U.K. Independence Party. Some descend from neofascists, like France\u2019s National Front. Others trace their DNA to Communist parties, like Slovakia\u2019s governing Direction\u2013Social Democracy. These populists seek to defend what the French call \u201cacquired rights\u201d\u2014health care, pensions, and other programs that benefit older people\u2014against bankers and technocrats who endlessly demand austerity; against migrants who make new claims and challenge accustomed ways; against a globalized market that depresses wages and benefits. In the United States, they lean Republican because they fear the Democrats want to take from them and redistribute to Americans who are newer, poorer, and in their view less deserving\u2014to \u201cspread the wealth around,\u201d in candidate Barack Obama\u2019s words to \u201cJoe the Plumber\u201d back in 2008. Yet they have come to fear more and more strongly that their party does not have their best interests at heart. Against all evidence, GOP donors interpreted the Tea Party as a movement in favor of the agenda of the Wall Street Journal editorial page. A majority of Republicans worry that corporations and the wealthy exert too much power. Their party leaders work to ensure that these same groups can exert even more. Mainstream Republicans were quite at ease with tax increases on households earning more than $250,000 in the aftermath of the Great Recession and the subsequent stimulus. Their congressional representatives had the opposite priorities. In 2008, many Republican primary voters had agreed with former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, who wanted \u201ctheir next president to remind them of the guy they work with, not the guy who laid them off.\u201d But those Republicans did not count for much once the primaries ended, and normal politics resumed between the multicultural Democrats and a plutocratic GOP.\n\nThis year, they are counting for more. Their rebellion against the power of organized money has upended American politics in ways that may reverberate for a long time. To understand what may come next, we must first review the recent past.\n\nNot so long ago, many observers worried that Americans had lost interest in politics. In his famous book Bowling Alone, published in 2000, the social scientist Robert Putnam bemoaned the collapse in American political participation during the second half of the 20th century. Putnam suggested that this trend would continue as the World War II generation gave way to disengaged Gen Xers. But even as Putnam\u2019s book went into paperback, that notion was falling behind the times. In the 1996 presidential election, voter turnout had tumbled to the lowest level since the 1920s, less than 52 percent. Turnout rose slightly in November 2000. Then, suddenly: overdrive. In the presidential elections of 2004 and 2008, voter turnout spiked to levels not seen since before the voting age was lowered to 18, and in 2012 it dipped only a little. Voters were excited by a hailstorm of divisive events: the dot-com bust, the Bush-versus-Gore recount, the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the Iraq War, the financial crisis, the bailouts and stimulus, and the Affordable Care Act. Putnam was right that Americans were turning away from traditional sources of information. But that was because they were turning to new ones: first cable news channels and partisan political documentaries; then blogs and news aggregators like the Drudge Report and The Huffington Post; after that, and most decisively, social media. Politics was becoming more central to Americans\u2019 identities in the 21st century than it ever was in the 20th. Would you be upset if your child married a supporter of a different party from your own? In 1960, only 5 percent of Americans said yes. In 2010, a third of Democrats and half of Republicans did. Political identity has become so central because it has come to overlap with so many other aspects of identity: race, religion, lifestyle. In 1960, I wouldn\u2019t have learned much about your politics if you told me that you hunted. Today, that hobby strongly suggests Republican loyalty. Unmarried? In 1960, that indicated little. Today, it predicts that you\u2019re a Democrat, especially if you\u2019re also a woman.\n\nMeanwhile, the dividing line that used to be the most crucial of them all\u2014class\u2014has increasingly become a division within the parties, not between them. Since 1984, nearly every Democratic presidential-primary race has ended as a contest between a \u201cwine track\u201d candidate who appealed to professionals (Gary Hart, Michael Dukakis, Paul Tsongas, Bill Bradley, and Barack Obama) and a \u201cbeer track\u201d candidate who mobilized the remains of the old industrial working class (Walter Mondale, Dick Gephardt, Bill Clinton, Al Gore, and Hillary Clinton). The Republicans have their equivalent in the battles between \u201cWall Street\u201d and \u201cMain Street\u201d candidates. Until this decade, however, both parties\u2014and especially the historically more cohesive Republicans\u2014managed to keep sufficient class peace to preserve party unity. Not anymore, at least not for the Republicans. The Great Recession ended in the summer of 2009. Since then, the U.S. economy has been growing, but most incomes have not grown comparably. In 2014, real median household income remained almost $4,000 below the pre-recession level, and well below the level in 1999. The country has recovered from the worst economic disaster since the Great Depression. Most of its people have not. Many Republicans haven\u2019t shared in the recovery and continued upward flight of their more affluent fellow partisans. It was these pessimistic Republicans who powered the Tea Party movement of 2009 and 2010. They were not, as a rule, libertarians looking for an ultraminimal government. The closest study we have of the beliefs of Tea Party supporters, led by Theda Skocpol, a Harvard political scientist, found that \u201cTea Partiers judge entitlement programs not in terms of abstract free-market orthodoxy, but according to the perceived deservingness of recipients. The distinction between \u2018workers\u2019 and \u2018people who don\u2019t work\u2019 is fundamental to Tea Party ideology.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s uncertain whether any Tea Partier ever really carried a placard that read keep your government hands off my Medicare. But if so, that person wasn\u2019t spouting gibberish. The Obama administration had laid hands on Medicare. It hoped to squeeze $500 billion out of the program from 2010 to 2020 to finance health insurance for the uninsured. You didn\u2019t have to look up the figures to have a sense that many of the uninsured were noncitizens (20 percent), or that even more were foreign-born (27 percent). In the Tea Party\u2019s angry town-hall meetings, this issue resonated perhaps more loudly than any other\u2014the ultimate example of redistribution from a deserving \u201cus\u201d to an undeserving \u201cthem.\u201d\n\nYet even as the Republican Main Street protested Obamacare, it rejected the hardening ideological orthodoxy of Republican donors and elected officials. A substantial minority of Republicans\u2014almost 30 percent\u2014said they would welcome \u201cheavy\u201d taxes on the wealthy, according to Gallup. Within the party that made Paul Ryan\u2019s entitlement-slashing budget plan a centerpiece of policy, only 21 percent favored cuts in Medicare and only 17 percent wanted to see spending on Social Security reduced, according to Pew. Less than a third of ordinary Republicans supported a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants (again according to Pew); a majority, by contrast, favored stepped-up deportation. As a class, big Republican donors could not see any of this, or would not. So neither did the politicians who depend upon them. Against all evidence, both groups interpreted the Tea Party as a mass movement in favor of the agenda of the Wall Street Journal editorial page. One of the more dangerous pleasures of great wealth is that you never have to hear anyone tell you that you are completely wrong.\n\nIt was Mitt Romney who got the first post\u2013Tea Party presidential nomination, and he ran on a platform of Conservatism Classic: tax cuts, budget cuts, deregulation, free trade\u2014all lightly seasoned with some concessions to the base regarding stricter immigration enforcement. The rank and file did not like it. But they could not stop it. The base kept elevating \u201cnot Romneys\u201d into first place, and each rapidly failed or fizzled; Romney, supported by a cumulative total of $139 million in primary funds by March 2012, trundled on. Romney ultimately lost the presidential election, of course, to the surprise and dismay of a party elite confident of victory until the very end. One might have expected this shock to force a rethink. The Republicans had now lost four out of the past six presidential elections. Another election had been won only in the Electoral College, despite the loss of the popular vote. Even their best showing, 50.7 percent of the vote in 2004, represented the closest escape of any incumbent president who won reelection since the first recorded popular vote.\n\nAnd yet, within hours of Romney\u2019s defeat, Republican donors, talkers, and officials converged on the maximally self-exculpating explanation. The problem had not been the plan to phase out Medicare for people younger than 55. Or the lack of ideas about how to raise wages. Or the commitment to ending health-insurance coverage for millions of working-age Americans. Or the anthems to wealth creation and entrepreneurship in a country increasingly skeptical of both. No, the problem was the one element of Romney\u2019s message they had never liked anyway: immigration enforcement. Maybe it was not a good idea for Jeb Bush\u2019s allies to describe his fund-raising strategy as \u201cshock and awe.\u201d Owners of capital assets, employers of low-skill laborers, and highly compensated professionals tend to benefit economically from the arrival of immigrants. They are better positioned to enjoy the attractive cultural and social results of migration (more-interesting food!) and to protect themselves against the burdensome impacts (surges in non-English-proficient pupils in public schools). A pro-immigration policy shift was one more assertion of class interest in a party program already brimful of them. Nobody expressed the party elites\u2019 consensus view more assuredly than Charles Krauthammer. \u201cIgnore the trimmers,\u201d he wrote in his first postelection column. \u201cThere\u2019s no need for radical change. The other party thinks it owns the demographic future\u2014counter that in one stroke by fixing the Latino problem. Do not, however, abandon the party\u2019s philosophical anchor \u2026 No reinvention when none is needed.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve gotta get rid of the immigration issue altogether,\u201d Sean Hannity told his radio audience the day after the election. \u201cIt\u2019s simple for me to fix it. I think you control the border first, you create a pathway for those people that are here, you don\u2019t say, \u2018You gotta go home.\u2019 And that is a position that I\u2019ve evolved on.\u201d A co-owner of Fox News\u2014Krauthammer and Hannity\u2019s TV network\u2014agreed: \u201cMust have sweeping, generous immigration reform,\u201d tweeted Rupert Murdoch on November 7, 2012. \u201cIt would be inhumane to send those people back, to send 12 million people out of this country,\u201d the casino mogul and Republican donor Sheldon Adelson told The Wall Street Journal in December of that year. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to find a way, find a route, for those people to get legal citizenship.\u201d The Republican National Committee made it all official in a March 2013 postelection report signed by party eminences. The report generally avoided policy recommendations, with a notable exception: \u201cWe must embrace and champion comprehensive immigration reform.\u201d To advance the cause, Paul Singer, one of the most open-pocketed GOP donors, made a six-figure contribution to the National Immigration Forum that spring.\n\nIf all of this sounds like a prescription for a Jeb Bush candidacy for president \u2026 well, perhaps that was not an entirely unintended consequence. Almost as soon as the new Congress convened in 2013, Senate Republicans worked to strike a deal over immigration issues. A bipartisan \u201cGang of Eight,\u201d including Florida\u2019s ambitious young Marco Rubio, agreed on a plan that would create a path to citizenship for millions of illegal immigrants and substantially increase legal-immigration limits for both high- and low-skilled workers. Otherwise, the party yielded on nothing and doubled down on everything. No U-turns. No compromises. The new strategy soon proved a total and utter failure. George W. Bush\u2019s tax cuts for high earners expired in 2013, and Republicans could not renew them. The drive to cut the deficit ended in budget sequestration, whose harshest effect fell on the military. The Gang of Eight deal never came to a vote in the House. All the while, Republicans\u2019 approval ratings slipped and slid. Instead of holding on to their base and adding Hispanics, Republicans alienated their base in return for no gains at all. By mid-2015, a majority of self-identified Republicans disapproved of their party\u2019s congressional leadership\u2014an intensity of disapproval never seen by the Republican majority of the 1990s nor by Democrats during their time in the majority after the 2006 midterm elections. In fact, disapproval had flared into an outright revolt of the Republican base in the summer of 2014. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, the No. 2 man in the Republican caucus, had emerged as a leader of the new line on immigration. Up for reelection in Virginia\u2019s Seventh District, Cantor was challenged that year by a conservative Christian professor of economics, Dave Brat. During Obama\u2019s first term, Tea Party insurgents had toppled incumbents and defeated party favorites in primaries from Delaware to Nevada. Those challenges had ended badly in the general election, for the most part: Tea Party Republicans lost at least five Senate seats that might plausibly have been won. Party leaders believed the lesson had been learned and expected their voters to be more tractable in future elections.\n\nCantor\u2019s loss to Brat jolted House leaders. Immigration reform slipped off their agenda. Marco Rubio repudiated his own deal. But Republican elites outside Congress did not get the message. They rationalized Cantor\u2019s defeat as a freak event, the sad consequence of a nationally minded politician\u2019s neglect of his district. They continued to fill the coffers of Jeb Bush and, to a lesser extent, Rubio and Scott Walker, all reliable purveyors of Conservatism Classic. Last February, three of the party\u2019s most important moneymen\u2014the fast-food executive Andrew Puzder, the health-care investor Mike Fernandez, and the national finance chair of Mitt Romney\u2019s 2012 campaign, Spencer Zwick\u2014publicly urged the GOP to push ahead toward more-open immigration. \u201cAmerica should be a destination for hardworking immigrants from all over the world,\u201d said Puzder, an advocate of importing more low-skilled laborers to meet the needs of his high-turnover industry. Zwick said that any presidential candidate who wanted to be taken seriously had better \u201cbe in a similar place\u201d to Jeb Bush on the immigration issue. Maybe it was not a good idea for Jeb Bush\u2019s allies to describe his fund-raising strategy as \u201cshock and awe.\u201d Perhaps the Iraq War reference stirred painful memories, even among Republicans. Still, Bush\u2019s fund-raising genuinely inspired awe. In his financial disclosure for the second quarter of 2015, Bush reported raising $11.4 million for his formal campaign and another $103 million for his super PAC. These funds were provided by a relatively small number of very wealthy people. Of Bush\u2019s presidential-campaign dollars, only 3 percent arrived in amounts of $200 or less. Almost 82 percent arrived in the maximum increment of $2,700. Nearly 80 percent of Bush\u2019s super-PAC take arrived in increments of $25,000 or more; about a quarter of the haul was made up of donations of $1 million or more. Yet seldom in the history of fund-raising has so much bought so little, so fleetingly. Between December 2014 and September 2015, Jeb Bush plunged from first place in the Republican field to fifth. Between late September and mid-October, he purchased 60 percent of all political spots aired in New Hampshire. That ad barrage pushed his poll numbers in the state from about 9 percent to about 8 percent.\n\nAs the governor of Florida, Bush had cut taxes and balanced budgets. He\u2019d challenged unions and championed charter schools. At the same time, Bush passionately supported immigration liberalization. The central event in his life history was his reinvention as an honorary Latino American when he married a Mexican woman, Columba Garnica de Gallo. He spoke Spanish at home. He converted to Catholicism. He sought his fortune with a Cuban American business partner. In his most quotable phrase, he described illegal immigration as an \u201cact of love.\u201d\n\nBush\u2019s update of Conservatism Classic had made him a hit with the party\u2019s big donors. He had won accolades from Karl Rove (\u201cthe deepest thinker on our side\u201d) and Arthur Brooks, the president of the American Enterprise Institute (\u201ca top-drawer intellect\u201d). Yet within five weeks of his formal declaration of candidacy on June 15, Bush\u2019s campaign had been brutally rejected by the GOP rank and file. From Jupiter Island, Florida, to Greenwich, Connecticut; from Dallas\u2019s Highland Park to Sea Island, Georgia; from Fifth Avenue in Manhattan to California\u2019s Newport Beach, the baffled question resounded: What went wrong? Big-dollar Republican favorites have run into trouble before, of course. Rudy Giuliani imploded in 2007\u201308; Mitt Romney\u2019s 2012 nomination was knocked off course as Republicans worked their way through a series of alternative front-runners: Rick Perry, Herman Cain, Newt Gingrich, and finally Rick Santorum. But Giuliani lost ground to two rivals equally acceptable to the donor elite, or nearly so: Mitt Romney and John McCain. In 2011\u201312, the longest any of the \u201cnot Romneys\u201d remained in first place was six weeks. In both cycles, resistance to the party favorite was concentrated among social and religious conservatives. The mutiny of the 2016 election cycle has been different. By the fall of 2015, a majority of Republicans favored candidates who had never been elected to anything: Donald Trump, Ben Carson, and Carly Fiorina. Fiorina\u2019s campaign was perhaps not so unusual. A former CEO, she appealed to the same business-minded Republicans who might have voted for Romney in 2012. Carson appealed to the same religious conservatives that candidates like Mike Huckabee and Santorum had appealed to in prior presidential cycles. What was new and astonishing was the Trump boom. He jettisoned party orthodoxy on issues ranging from entitlement spending to foreign policy. He scoffed at trade agreements. He said rude things about Sheldon Adelson and the Koch brothers. He reviled the campaign contributions of big donors\u2014himself included!\u2014as open and blatant favor-buying. Trump\u2019s surge was a decisive repudiation by millions of Republican voters of the collective wisdom of their party elite. Trump\u2019s grim pessimism didn\u2019t resonate with those who\u2019d ridden the S&P 500 giddily upward. But it found an audience all the same. When Trump first erupted into the Republican race in June, he did so with a message of grim pessimism. \u201cWe got $18 trillion in debt. We got nothing but problems \u2026 We\u2019re dying. We\u2019re dying. We need money \u2026 We have losers. We have people that don\u2019t have it. We have people that are morally corrupt. We have people that are selling this country down the drain \u2026 The American dream is dead.\u201d\n\nThat message did not resonate with those who\u2019d ridden the S&P 500 from less than 900 in 2009 to more than 2,000 in 2015. But it found an audience all the same. Half of Trump\u2019s supporters within the GOP had stopped their education at or before high-school graduation, according to the polling firm YouGov. Only 19 percent had a college or postcollege degree. Thirty-eight percent earned less than $50,000. Only 11 percent earned more than $100,000. Trump Republicans were not ideologically militant. Just 13 percent said they were very conservative; 19 percent described themselves as moderate. Nor were they highly religious by Republican standards.\n\nWhat set them apart from other Republicans was their economic insecurity and the intensity of their economic nationalism. Sixty-three percent of Trump supporters wished to end birthright citizenship for the children of illegal immigrants born on U.S. soil\u2014a dozen points higher than the norm for all Republicans. More than other Republicans, Trump supporters distrusted Barack Obama as alien and dangerous: Only 21 percent acknowledged that the president was born in the United States, according to an August survey by the Democratic-oriented polling firm PPP. Sixty-six percent believed the president was a Muslim. Trump promised to protect these voters\u2019 pensions from their own party\u2019s austerity. \u201cWe\u2019ve got Social Security that\u2019s going to be destroyed if somebody like me doesn\u2019t bring money into the country. All these other people want to cut the hell out of it. I\u2019m not going to cut it at all; I\u2019m going to bring money in, and we\u2019re going to save it.\u201d He promised to protect their children from being drawn into another war in the Middle East, this time in Syria. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to have World War III,\u201d he told The Washington Post in October, \u201cit\u2019s not going to be over Syria.\u201d As for the politicians threatening to shoot down the Russian jets flying missions in Syria, \u201cI won\u2019t even call them hawks. I call them the fools.\u201d\n\nHe promised a campaign independent of the influences of money that had swayed so many Republican races of the past. \u201cI will tell you that our system is broken. I gave to many people. Before this, before two months ago, I was a businessman. I give to everybody. When they call, I give. And you know what? When I need something from them, two years later, three years later, I call them. They are there for me. And that\u2019s a broken system.\u201d He promised above all to protect their wages from being undercut by Republican immigration policy.\n\nIt cannot last, can it? \u201cThe casino does not always win,\u201d Stuart Stevens, Mitt Romney\u2019s lead strategist during the 2012 campaign, quipped to me in September. \u201cBut that\u2019s the way to bet.\u201d The casino won in 2012, and will very likely win again in 2016. And yet already, Trump has destroyed one elite-favored presidential candidacy, Scott Walker\u2019s, and crippled two others, Jeb Bush\u2019s and Chris Christie\u2019s. He has thrown into disarray the party\u2019s post-2012 comeback strategy, and pulled into the center of national discussion issues and constituencies long relegated to the margins. Something has changed in American politics since the Great Recession. The old slogans ring hollow. The insurgent candidates are less absurd, the orthodox candidates more vulnerable. The GOP donor elite planned a dynastic restoration in 2016. Instead, it triggered an internal class war. The contest for the presidency turns on external events as much as\u2014or more than\u2014internal party politics. George W. Bush\u2019s team believed that the last-minute revelation of a 1976 drunk-driving arrest cost him the popular vote in the 2000 election. Jimmy Carter blamed his 1980 defeat on the debacle of the attempted rescue of American hostages in Iran. So anything can happen. But that does not mean anything will happen. Barring shocks, presidential elections turn on the fundamentals of economics, demography, and ideology.\n\nThe puzzle for the monied leaders of the Republican Party is: What now? And what next after that? None of the options facing the GOP elite is entirely congenial. But there appear to be four paths the elite could follow, for this campaign season and beyond. They lead the party in very different directions. Option 1: Double Down The premise of the past few thousand words is that the Republican donor elite failed to impose its preferred candidate on an unwilling base in 2015 for big and important reasons. But maybe that premise is wrong. Maybe Jeb Bush has just been a bad candidate with a radioactive last name. Maybe the same message and platform would have worked fine if espoused by a fresher and livelier candidate. Such is the theory of Marco Rubio\u2019s campaign. Or\u2014even if the donor message and platform have troubles\u2014maybe $100 million in negative ads can scorch any potential alternative, enabling the donor-backed candidate to win by default. And if not Rubio, maybe the core donor message could still work if joined to a true outsider candidacy: Ben Carson\u2019s, for example. Carson is often regarded as a protest candidate, but as The Weekly Standard\u2019s Fred Barnes enthused back in January 2015: \u201cOne thing not in doubt is Carson\u2019s conservatism. He\u2019s the real deal, an economic, social, and foreign policy conservative.\u201d Carson may say wacky things, but he does not say heterodox things. Yet even if the Republican donor elite can keep control of the party while doubling down, it\u2019s doubtful that the tactic can ultimately win presidential elections. The \u201cchange nothing but immigration\u201d advice was a self-flattering fantasy from the start. Immigration is not the main reason Republican presidential candidates lose so badly among Latino and Asian American voters, and never was: Latino voters are more likely to list education and health care as issues that are extremely important to them. A majority of Asian Americans are non-Christian and susceptible to exclusion by sectarian religious themes.\n\nSo \u2026 Option 2: Tactical Concession Perhaps some concession to the disgruntled base is needed. That\u2019s the theory of the Cruz campaign and\u2014after a course correction\u2014also of the Christie campaign. Instead of 2013\u2019s \u201cConservatism Classic Plus Immigration Liberalization,\u201d Cruz and Christie are urging \u201cConservatism Classic Plus Immigration Enforcement.\u201d True, Cruz\u2019s carefully selected words on immigration leave open the possibility of guest-worker programs or other pro-employer reforms after a burst of border enforcement. But Cruz and Christie have seen the reaction to Donald Trump\u2019s message, and appear to appreciate the need to at least seem to do something to redress the grievances of the Republican base. Much of the donor elite could likely be convinced that while Jeb Bush\u2019s idea of immigration reform would be good to have, it isn\u2019t a must-have. Just as the party elite reached a pact on abortion with social conservatives in the 1980s, it could concede the immigration issue to its Main Street base in the 2010s. The party elites\u2019 \u201cchange nothing but immigration\u201d advice after Romney\u2019s defeat was a self-flattering fantasy from the start. Yet a narrow focus on immigration populism alone seems insufficient to raise Republican hopes. Trump shrewdly joins his immigration populism to trade populism. On the Democratic side, Bernie Sanders\u2019s opposition to open borders is logically connected to his hopes for a Democratic Socialist future: His admired Denmark upholds high labor standards along with some of the world\u2019s toughest immigration rules. Severed from a larger agenda, however\u2014as Mitt Romney tried to sever the issue in 2012\u2014immigration populism looks at best like pandering, and at worst like identity politics for white voters. In a society that is and always has been multiethnic and polyglot, any national party must compete more broadly than that. Which brings us to \u2026 Option 3: True Reform Admittedly, this may be the most uncongenial thought of them all, but party elites could try to open more ideological space for the economic interests of the middle class. Make peace with universal health-insurance coverage: Mend Obamacare rather than end it. Cut taxes less at the top, and use the money to deliver more benefits to working families in the middle. Devise immigration policy to support wages, not undercut them. Worry more about regulations that artificially transfer wealth upward, and less about regulations that constrain financial speculation. Take seriously issues such as the length of commutes, nursing-home costs, and the anticompetitive practices that inflate college tuition. Remember that Republican voters care more about aligning government with their values of work and family than they care about cutting the size of government as an end in itself. Recognize that the gimmick of mobilizing the base with culture-war outrages stopped working at least a decade ago.\n\nSuch a party would cut health-care costs by squeezing providers, not young beneficiaries. It would boost productivity by investing in hard infrastructure\u2014bridges, airports, water-treatment plants. It would restore Dwight Eisenhower to the Republican pantheon alongside Ronald Reagan and emphasize the center in center-right.\n\nTo imagine the change is to see how convulsive it would be\u2014and how unlikely. True, center-right conservative parties backed by broad multiethnic coalitions of the middle class have gained and exercised power in other English-speaking countries, even as Republicans lost the presidency in 2008 and 2012. But the most-influential voices in American conservatism reject the experience of their foreign counterparts as weak, unprincipled, and unnecessary. In parliamentary democracy, winning or losing is starkly binary: A party either is in power or is the opposition. In the American system, that binary is much blurrier. Republicans can, of course, exert some control over government as long as they hold any one of the House, Senate, or presidency. Which brings us finally to \u2026 Option 4: Change the Rules of the Game \u201cThe filibuster used to be bad. Now it\u2019s good.\u201d So Fred Thompson, the late actor and former Republican senator, jokingly told an audience on a National Review cruise shortly after Barack Obama won the presidency for the first time. How partisans feel about process issues is notoriously related to what process would benefit them at any given moment. Liberals loved the interventionist Supreme Court in the 1960s and \u201970s, hated it in the 1990s and 2000s\u2014and may rotate their opinion again if a President Hillary Clinton can tilt a majority of the Supreme Court their way. It\u2019s an old story that may find a new twist if and when Republicans acknowledge that the presidency may be attainable only after they make policy changes that are unacceptable to the party elite. There are metrics, after all, by which the post-2009 GOP appears to be a supremely successful political party. Recently, Rory Cooper, of the communications firm Purple Strategies, tallied a net gain to the Republicans of 69 seats in the House of Representatives, 13 seats in the Senate, 900-plus seats in state legislatures, and 12 governorships since Obama took office. With that kind of grip on state government, in particular, Republicans are well positioned to write election and voting rules that sustain their hold on the national legislature. The president may be able to grant formerly illegal immigrants the right to work, but he cannot grant them the right to vote. In this light, instead of revising Republican policies to stop future Barack Obamas and Hillary Clintons, maybe it\u2019s necessary to revise only the party rules to stop future Donald Trumps from confronting party elites with their own unpopularity.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The GOP planned a dynastic restoration in 2016.
