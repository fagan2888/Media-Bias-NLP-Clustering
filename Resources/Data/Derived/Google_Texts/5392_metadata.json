Real property is defined as \u201cland, structures and facilities, improvements, fixtures, and related personal property.\u201d\n\nRelated: US Taxpayers Paid Millions for Shoddy, Unsafe Buildings in Afghanistan\n\nOf the 715 bases the U.S. used over the course of the war, 391 were turned over to the Afghan government, with the lion\u2019s share \u2014 57 percent \u2014 transferred to the National Army, SIGAR found. The Afghan National Police received 30 percent of the donated bases, while others were given to offices within the country\u2019s Defense and Interior ministries.\n\nThe U.S. can\u2019t sell excess real estate to Kabul and if a site isn\u2019t transferred to another federal agency or office within the military it can be abandoned, deconstructed or charitably donated, SIGAR states.\n\nThe military can decide to dismantle a base if it\u2019s in dangers of falling into enemy hands, though sometimes it makes more fiscal sense to transfer it.\n\nAnd the U.S. doesn\u2019t own the market on goodwill, according to SIGAR. When NATO formally ended its mission in volatile Helmand province, around $236 million worth of property was given to the Afghan government, while only $39 million worth was disassembled.\n\nRelated: Where Did $800 Million in Afghan Aid Go? The Pentagon Shrugs Its Shoulders\n\nThe Pentagon did close 219 of its bases, the fact sheet states, and the total depreciated value of bases that once supported U.S. troops but that Washington has since abandoned or destroyed amounts to about $48 million.\n\nLast year President Obama scrapped his plan to reduce the military footprint in the country to a nominal embassy presence in Kabul by the end of 2016.\n\nInstead, the administration will keep 5,500 troops and a small number of bases \u2013 SIGAR says 12 U.S.-operated bases remain open \u2013 into 2017 to continue training and providing support to Afghan security forces.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The U.S. Defense Department gave away nearly $1 billion of property to the Afghan government over the course of about five years as the Pentagon worked to shrink its footprint in the war-ravaged country, a new government watchdog fact sheet states.", "title": "US Has Given Nearly $1 Billion in Property to Afghanistan\u2019s Government", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/03/28/US-Has-Given-Nearly-1-Billion-Property-Afghanistan-s-Government", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/afghanistan-army-desertions_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/03/28/US-Has-Given-Nearly-1-Billion-Property-Afghanistan-s-Government", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/afghanistan-army-desertions_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "The U.S. Defense Department gave away nearly $1 billion of property to the Afghan government over the course of about five years as the Pentagon worked to shrink its footprint in the war-ravaged country, a new government watchdog fact sheet states.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "When NATO formally ended its mission in volatile Helmand province, around $236 million worth of property was given to the Afghan government, while only $39 million worth was disassembled.\nThe Afghan National Police received 30 percent of the donated bases, while others were given to offices within the country\u2019s Defense and Interior ministries.\nInstead, the administration will keep 5,500 troops and a small number of bases \u2013 SIGAR says 12 U.S.-operated bases remain open \u2013 into 2017 to continue training and providing support to Afghan security forces.\nThe U.S. Defense Department gave away nearly $1 billion of property to the Afghan government over the course of five years as the Pentagon worked to shrink its footprint in the war-ravaged country, a new government watchdog fact sheet states.\nRelated: Where Did $800 Million in Afghan Aid Go?"}
