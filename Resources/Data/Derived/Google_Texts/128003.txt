Athens Neighborhood Health Center, which provides primary and preventative health care to medically underserved residents of Athens, will open a third location next year.

The new facility, at 3320 Old Jefferson Road, will join ANHCâ€™s McKinley Drive and College Avenue locations.

ANHC CEO Melinda Craig said the organization also plans to open a pharmacy in December.

According to Craig, ANHC has served more than 6,000 people thus far people this year, and has helped more than 1,500 people find health insurance coverage through provisions of the federal Affordable Care Act.

Additionally, a federal grant allowed the center to expanded its staff from 13 to 30 people.

Those new staff members include a family nurse practitioner, an internist, a pediatric nurse practitioner, a pharmacist and an array of support staff.

The center also expanded its partnerships with more than 75 local medical specialists, Craig said.

And, Craig added, the center earned its continued designation as a federally qualified health center in May, which will mean an additional $600,000 a year in grant funding over the next three years.
