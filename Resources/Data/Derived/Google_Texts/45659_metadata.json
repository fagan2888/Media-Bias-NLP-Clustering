They quickly acquired three high chairs, a crib, three toddler beds and two sets of bunk beds for their four-bedroom home in Henderson.\n\nThe seven siblings stayed for six months until they were returned to their biological parents. But the Martinezes kept in touch, and when the three youngest were returned to foster care a few years later, the couple took them back.\n\nThis was despite the fact that the Martinezes in the meantime had adopted a set of four siblings \u2014 two girls and two boys \u2014 who had been split among three foster families in Colorado and Texas.\n\nWhen those four kids, ages 4, 5, 9 and 12, moved in with the Martinezes in 2010, the older boys hadn\u2019t seen their younger sisters in two years. They had kept in touch with a weekly, 15-minute phone call.\n\nThe Martinezes adopted the four children in November 2010 and are now trying to adopt the youngest three of their original seven foster children.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great journey, a great adventure,\u201d said Rafael Martinez, a postal carrier. \u201cAs much as they\u2019ve changed our lives, we\u2019ve changed theirs too.\u201d\n\nThey were honored by the Colorado Department of Human Services during a ceremony and tour of the governor\u2019s residence for their willingness to adopt large sibling groups. That\u2019s rare, as most foster parents take in one to four children.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid to open up your heart to that,\u201d said Rebecca Fernandez Martinez, who works for the Denver Scholarship Foundation.\n\nEach of the five families were honored with awards and a video tribute during the ceremony attended by about 100 people.\n\n\u201cAll of you, parents and children alike, are shining examples of the power of love and family,\u201d said Reggie Bicha, the state\u2019s executive director of human services. \u201cThe families that you have created are inspiring and enriching.\u201d\n\nAbout 640 foster children in Colorado will find permanent homes this year through adoption. Still, there are 288 kids waiting for families.\n\nFor information, visit COFosterandAdopt.org.\n\nJennifer Brown: 303-954-1593, jenbrown@denverpost.com or @jbrowndpost", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Colorado honors five families in adoption ceremony", "title": "Colorado honors five families in adoption ceremony", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/11/07/colorado-honors-five-families-in-adoption-ceremony/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151107_051939_adoption-honors-groupphoto.jpg", "height": 442}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151107_051939_adoption-honors-groupphoto.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-07T17:08:19+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-20T03:03:31+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThe families that you have created are inspiring and enriching.\u201dAbout 640 foster children in Colorado will find permanent homes this year through adoption.\n\u201cHow about seven?\u201d a caseworker asked the couple, one of five families honored Saturday at the governor\u2019s mansion.\nThe Martinezes adopted the four children in November 2010 and are now trying to adopt the youngest three of their original seven foster children.\nEach of the five families were honored with awards and a video tribute during the ceremony attended by about 100 people.\nThe seven siblings stayed for six months until they were returned to their biological parents."}
