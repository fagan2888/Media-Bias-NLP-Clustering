Last year fishermen caught more than 95,000 metric tons of the fish for the first time since 2009, federal statistics show.\n\nNow rival fishermen are raising concerns about the high catches, and regulators are starting to consider whether the big haul is adversely impacting the environment, marine mammals or other fisheries.\n\nHerring trawlers have the ability to deplete localized areas of other fish, in part because the hulking boats leave pieces of ocean bereft of the herring other species they rely on to eat, some fishermen of species such as cod and tuna complain.\n\nSteve Weiner, a tuna fisherman based out of Ogunquit, Maine, said the high herring catches need a hard look because of the fish\u2019s status as a lynchpin of the Atlantic Ocean\u2019s food web. Everything from seabirds to whale-watching boats rely on a steady supply of herring for stability, he said.\n\nThe issue is particularly concerning for Cape Cod fishermen, many of whom are struggling to make a living in a time of strict cod quotas, Weiner said.\n\n\u201cYou have to worry about all the other people who depend on healthy herring resources,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you get down to the Cape, it\u2019s raw, real.\u201d\n\nBut some herring fishermen dismiss those complaints as nonsense and reference federal studies that describe the species as \u201cnot overfished.\u201d\n\nThe herring trawlers can be more than 100 feet long and drag 300-foot nets behind them to catch hundreds of thousands of pounds of herring. Fishermen of other species complain that they also take other fish as bycatch, and environmentalists have long charged that they sometimes kill marine mammals. Fishing observers found that midwater herring trawlers killed four pilot whales, three seals and a dolphin through incidental catch in Northeast oceans in 2014, federal statistics show.\n\nFishermen and conservationists have also charged that wiping herring out of localized areas of the ocean makes those areas economically worthless because other species then stay away.\n\nThe New England Fishery Management Council, which regulates fishing in the area, will solicit feedback from the industry and the public about the issue of \u201clocalized depletion,\u201d said Lori Steele, a fishery analyst for the council. It\u2019s too early to say what the council will do with the information, she said.\n\nMary Beth Tooley, who sits on the council, said it will be important to develop scientific metrics for localized depletion. Tooley also works in government relations for O\u2019Hara Corporation, which operates two herring trawlers out of Rockland, Maine. She said the issue has become \u201cpolitical\u201d in recent years.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Huge herring haul worries rival fishermen, environmentalists", "title": "Huge herring haul worries rival fishermen, environmentalists", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Huge herring haul worries rival fishermen, environmentalists", "title": "Huge herring haul worries rival fishermen, environmentalists", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/07/12/huge_herring_haul_worries_rival_fishermen_environmentalists/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/07/herring-boom.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Huge herring haul worries rival fishermen, environmentalists", "title": "Huge herring haul worries rival fishermen, environmentalists", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/07/herring-boom.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Patrick Whittle", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0206\"", "article_summary": "Tooley also works in government relations for O\u2019Hara Corporation, which operates two herring trawlers out of Rockland, Maine.\nFishing observers found that midwater herring trawlers killed four pilot whales, three seals and a dolphin through incidental catch in Northeast oceans in 2014, federal statistics show.\nLast year fishermen caught more than 95,000 metric tons of the fish for the first time since 2009, federal statistics show.\nFishermen of other species complain that they also take other fish as bycatch, and environmentalists have long charged that they sometimes kill marine mammals.\nFishermen and conservationists have also charged that wiping herring out of localized areas of the ocean makes those areas economically worthless because other species then stay away."}
