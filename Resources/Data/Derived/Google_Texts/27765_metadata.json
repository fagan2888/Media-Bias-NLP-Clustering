The companies work with insurers to create \u201cformularies\u201d that specify what patients spend for different drugs, which can steer patients to lower-cost options. They also have programs to reduce waste with costly drugs by making sure patients take them.\n\nRhode Island-based CVS Health released its annual report on drug spending in late February, attributing moderation in cost trends to its management services.\n\nLast week, St. Louis-based Express Scripts issued a report with similar numbers and a similar conclusion.\n\nMinnetonka-based UnitedHealth Group\u2019s division called OptumRx, which is now the third largest pharmaceutical benefit manager, hasn\u2019t yet issued its drug trend report.\n\nRitter of ClearScript said the drug trend reports this year are unusual because they factor the rebates the companies negotiate with drug companies. Rebates moderate the growth curve, he said, but aren\u2019t necessarily passed along to all clients.\n\nIn 2015, there wasn\u2019t a repeat of the upheaval caused the previous year, Ritter said, with new hepatitis C medications.\n\nThe drugs offer phenomenally high cure rates, and thereby are helping many patients avoid serious health care problems such as liver failure. That, in turn, generates long-run savings by avoiding costly treatments like liver transplants.\n\nBut in the short term, pharmacy budgets were rocked because the new drugs cost about $1,000 per pill. Patients take one per day for about three months, for a total tab of about $90,000.\n\nThe costs were still in pharmacy budgets during 2015, but commercial insurers started to see the supply of patients needing drugs moderate as treatment brought cures, said David Lassen, chief clinical officer at Prime Therapeutics, a PBM based in Eagan.\n\n\u201cAs you look ahead in 2016, we\u2019re anticipating an even further reduction in trend due to hepatitis C,\u201d Lassen said.\n\nPrime Therapeutics hasn\u2019t published its drug trend report yet, either, but Lassen said the company had a similar experience to the other PBMs. Following cost shocks in 2014, more employers were willing to adopt cost-control measures in the pharmacy benefit portion of their health plans, said Steve Johnson, the senior director of health outcomes.\n\nRebates helped moderate drug cost trends last year at HealthPartners, said Rick Bruzek, vice president of pharmacy services for the Bloomington-based health plan. Even after removing the rebate impact, trends moderated due in part to high use of low-cost generic medications, Bruzek said, and a moderate decrease in utilization.\n\nEven so, costs were up overall due to increases with brand-name drugs, Bruzek said, as well as brand name \u201cspecialty\u201d drugs, such as treatments for cancer, hepatitis C, multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still consuming a larger and larger portion of the health care dollar, and that\u2019s what employers are concerned about,\u201d he said.\n\nAt Minnetonka-based Medica, spokesman Greg Bury said the company\u2019s experience last year was different from that reported by the large national PBMs, as there was no moderation in drug cost trends.\n\n\u201cWe are faced with substantial drug manufacturer price increases in the specialty market, combined with an increase in membership utilizing high cost specialty agents,\u201d Bury said in a statement.\n\nThat use of specialty medications carries over to the new government-run health insurance exchange markets, Bury said. Similarly, Express Scripts reported that use and prices for both traditional and specialty medications grew faster on the exchanges, which were launched by the federal Affordable Care Act, than the commercially insured market last year.\n\n\u201cThe way this program is designed, it attracts people who are in need of care, not necessarily those who are well and want to have a safety net in case they become ill,\u201d said Julie Huppert, an Express Scripts vice president, in a statement. \u201cMany millennials may be doing the math on the tax penalty and deferring enrollment until they need it.\u201d\n\nTwitter: @chrissnowbeck", "article_metadata": {"description": "After drugs with huge price tags rocked pharmacy budgets in 2014, inflation in medication costs eased last year, benefit managers say, due to spending controls and fewer new blockbusters.", "og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "After drugs with huge price tags rocked pharmacy budgets in 2014, inflation in medication costs eased last year, benefit managers say, due to spending controls and fewer new blockbusters.", "title": "Drug price inflation slows, but pharmacy costs are still in the fast lane", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/drug-price-inflation-slows-but-pharmacy-costs-are-still-in-the-fast-lane/372612101/", "image": {"url": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201858", "width": 1680, "identifier": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201858", "height": 876}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "After drugs with huge price tags rocked pharmacy budgets in 2014, inflation in medication costs eased last year, benefit managers say, due to spending controls and fewer new blockbusters.", "title": "Drug price inflation slows, but pharmacy costs are still in the fast lane", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/drug-price-inflation-slows-but-pharmacy-costs-are-still-in-the-fast-lane/372612101/", "image": {"src": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201858", "identifier": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201858"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "article": {"tag": "prescription drug costs"}, "news_keywords": "prescription drug costs"}, "article_summary": "Ritter of ClearScript said the drug trend reports this year are unusual because they factor the rebates the companies negotiate with drug companies.\nInsurers and drug benefit managers in the Twin Cities see a somewhat similar trend locally, although there\u2019s still plenty of sticker shock with pharmacy bills.\nMinnetonka-based UnitedHealth Group\u2019s division called OptumRx, which is now the third largest pharmaceutical benefit manager, hasn\u2019t yet issued its drug trend report.\nBut in the short term, pharmacy budgets were rocked because the new drugs cost about $1,000 per pill.\nRebates helped moderate drug cost trends last year at HealthPartners, said Rick Bruzek, vice president of pharmacy services for the Bloomington-based health plan."}
