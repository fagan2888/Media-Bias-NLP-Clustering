No worries, there\u2019s a free app for that: \u201ciVibe Massager Lite.\u201d However, while the user reviews may seem promising, with a 3.5 out of 5-star average, customers are bribing to have the app deleted from their purchase history.\n\nThe reviews appear to be from fearful teens who don\u2019t want their parents (whose credit cards are likely attached to their iTunes accounts) seeing what they\u2019ve downloaded. Here are some of the best reviews from the iTunes Store:\n\n\u201cI gave u 5 stars please remove I had a cramp In my back and I don\u2019t want my parents to think the wrong way please please please please please please please please\u201d \u201cOmg I gave you 5 stars please remove from my purchased list I had any idea that this was a sex toy! I was looking for an actual massager!!!!!\u201d \u201cMy friend bought it for me saying \u2018you might need it\u2019 but I don\u2019t want it and I don\u2019t want my parents thinking I\u2019m doing things so PLEASE!!remove it off my purchased list!!\u201d \u201cI let my bestie use my phone and she downloaded bad apps please remove from my purchased list thanks\u201d \u201cMy friends took my phone and downloaded this. I don\u2019t want to get in trouble Please remove from my purchase list\" \u201cI thought this was for something completely different...\u201d\n\nIn the last reviewer\u2019s defense, from the title of the app, it does come off as simply a massager. But, quickly after reading the description, you realize it\u2019s much more than that. \u201cYou can even use it in personal areas to spice up your life ;),\u201d reads the iTunes app description.\n\n\u201cBecause you cary [sic] your phone everywhere you go, you need not to worry about someone accidentally finding your personal pleasure secret. After all, its just a phone. Right? Right. ;),\u201d the iVibe Massager official website reads.\n\nDespite the 5-star ratings the reviewers have promised, the seller of the app (Robot Mouse, LLC) doesn\u2019t have the ability to edit purchase history. In reponse to all the fearful reviewers, this message was posted on iTunes by Robot Mouse, LLC, \u201cATTENTION! If you wish to remove this app from your purchase list, please contact apple support.
