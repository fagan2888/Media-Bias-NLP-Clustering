Ten board members \u2014 with Steve Kindler absent \u2014 attended Thursday night\u2019s meeting.\n\nBoard member Victor Goodman made the motion to approve the federally-funded Community Eligibility Program, but agreed to table the issue until next month pending the outcome of the County Commission\u2019s vote on the proposed budget for 2014-2015.\n\nBoard Chairman Jim Morrison and schools director Eddie Hickman pointed out that the timing of the vote is complicated since the schools\u2019 food service budget already has been approved by the board and the county commission. However, that budget is not final until a vote on Aug. 5.\n\nHickman said approving the CEP now \u201cmay or may not muddy the waters\u201d since that would require reworking the food service budget, re-voting and then submitting that approved budget again to the county. The change would then have to go through the adoption process again with the county commissioner, therefore delaying adoption of the entire county budget, he said.\n\nBrian Parkhurst, the school\u2019s nutrition manager, said the school has until Aug. 31 to join the program. He has recommended the district implement the program in 10 schools with the highest percentage of low-income students \u2014 Baker Elementary, Brown Elementary, Cox Middle, Highland Park Elementary, Howell Elementary, McDowell Elementary, Mt. Pleasant elementary, middle and high schools and Riverside Elementary.\n\nThose schools have a combined attendance of 4,319 students with 2,748 or nearly 64 percent identified as low-income and qualifies those schools to provide free breakfast and lunch to all students, he said.\n\nUnder the program, a particular school must have at least 40 percent of identified low-income students in order to qualify. At that threshold, 64 percent of the students would receive free meals and 36 percent would pay a reduced cost. The school district would then be reimbursed for the costs of those meals, Parkhurst explained.\n\nAs the percentage of low-income students increases, the more free meals will be provided under the program. For example, at a 65 percent rate, all meals would be provided for free, he said.\n\nDuring a July 10 meeting, school board members voted 4-3 in favor of enrollment, but the measure failed because it lacked a majority of the entire board. Some of those who opposed the program said they did not feel comfortable implementing a program that didn\u2019t benefit all the schools.\n\nParkhurst had previously reported that giving free meals to all students district-wide would require the district to pay $1.17 million in its own funds \u2014 funding that would deplete the fund balance by half the first year.\n\nBoard member Jerry Lassiter said since the previous meeting he has had about a dozen constituents ask him questions about the program. After questioning Parkhurst at Thursday\u2019s meeting, Lassister said he believes he can answer the questions proposed to him.\n\nHe concluded that implementing the CEP may not require a \u201cbig jump\u201d in hiring more personnel; that students receiving free or reduced-cost meals will continue to be served either way; that it will not cost the district more just for those 10 schools; and those schools already have up-to-date equipment.\n\nLassiter said the biggest question posed to him was \u201cWhat\u2019s the problem we\u2019re trying to fix.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis gives us a chance to take care of more kids,\u201d Parkhurst said. \u201cThat\u2019s really the main reason.\u201d\n\nBoard member Tommy Dudley said he still has concerns about the district not offering the program in all schools.\n\n\u201cIt bothers me to tell certain people from certain schools to say, \u2018Guess what? You\u2019re just out of luck\u2019,\u201d he said.\n\nJim Pennings, another board member, said the meal program is important to families who barely have enough income to feed their children or to those families who are too proud to allow their children to participate. He said there are other academic and sports programs that are not the same throughout the district, so offering the meal program in 10 schools shouldn\u2019t be an issue.\n\n\u201cWe have a chance to help three-quarters of our students,\u201d he said. \u201cI think in all good conscience we need to implement this program.\u201d\n\nGoodman said eating right is important to helping a child learn.\n\n\u201cChildren can\u2019t learn when they are hungry. You can\u2019t work when you are hungry,\u201d he said. \u201cWe really need to take advantage of this opportunity.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A floundering free-meal program proposed for school children may get a second chance after the Maury County School Board agreed Thursday to reconsider a vote on the issue at next month\u2019s meeting.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "VANESSA CURRY vcurry@c-dh.net", "og": {"url": "http://columbiadailyherald.com/news/local-news/free-school-meal-plan-gets-second-look", "type": "article", "site_name": "Columbia Daily Herald", "description": "A floundering free-meal program proposed for school children may get a second chance after the Maury County School Board agreed Thursday to reconsider a vote on the issue at next month\u2019s meeting.", "title": "Free school meal plan gets second look"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://columbiadailyherald.com/news/local-news/free-school-meal-plan-gets-second-look", "creator": "@thedailyherald", "card": "summary", "title": "Free school meal plan gets second look"}, "al": {"web": {"should_fallback": "true"}, "android": {"url": "columbiadailyherald://?eid=928139", "app_name": "columbiadailyherald", "package": "com.stephensmedia.columbiadailyherald"}, "ios": {"url": "columbiadailyherald://?eid=928139", "app_store_id": 964773799, "app_name": "columbiadailyherald"}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=964773799", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.stephensmedia.columbiadailyherald", "keywords": "Local News,Local News,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-26T21:04:55-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=0.9"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe160f\"", "article_summary": "A floundering free-meal program proposed for school children may get a second chance after the Maury County School Board agreed Thursday to reconsider a vote on the issue at next month\u2019s meeting.\nAt that threshold, 64 percent of the students would receive free meals and 36 percent would pay a reduced cost.\nDuring a July 10 meeting, school board members voted 4-3 in favor of enrollment, but the measure failed because it lacked a majority of the entire board.\nThe school district would then be reimbursed for the costs of those meals, Parkhurst explained.\nAs the percentage of low-income students increases, the more free meals will be provided under the program."}
