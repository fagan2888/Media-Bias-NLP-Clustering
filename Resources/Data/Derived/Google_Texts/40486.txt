Wechsler School was erected in 1894 as the first brick public school building in Mississippi built for African-American children and a local group of Meridianites are trying to save the historic building.

“It is a part of history and what we are trying to do is bring back some history and open up some history and put it back on the map, as it was the first black school here in Meridian and try to get the facility so we can use it for different activities in the area,” explained Plenesia Butchee who is with the Wechsler Foundation.

As a way to bring focus to Wechsler School and the efforts to help save the building, the Save Wechsler Foundation held a big community event on the City Hall Lawn to raise donations to get the facility usable again.

“We have repairs and stuff that needs to be done in order to get it back working to be able to use the facility, so what we are trying to do is raise money to open Wechsler back up,” explained Butchee.

From dancing, to reciting historic facts about the history of the school, to singing from Meridian native Pat Brown, the event was educational and uplifting in helping raise awareness about the school.

“It is a part of Meridian’s heritage. It has been around for a long time, so I just feel like anything I can do to help my hometown, that is what I want to do,” explained Blues Singer and Meridian native Pat Brown.

With today’s children being our future, leaders with the Wechsler Foundation feel it is important to try and preserve this historic building for future generations to come.

“I hope this is going to change history and that is what I want to be a part of, I know kids are our future, and if you come together for them then we can come together for each other,” explained Butchee.
