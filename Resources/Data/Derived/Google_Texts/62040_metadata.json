Edmondson, Ph.D. of Harvard Business School. \"Teaming involves fluid, collaborative, interdependent work across shifting projects and with a shifting mix of partners, often across organizational boundaries.\"\n\nEdmondson said that a patient can interact with up to 60 caregivers in an average hospital day. Something as simple as a CT scan can require the coordination of up to six different hospital departments. As such, healthcare institutions are not constructed to serve the needs of patients and give them the best care.\n\nShe advised healthcare teams to frame their work as a highly collaborative and complex process to get care providers thinking in terms of interdependency. Then, she said, the work environment must be a \"safe\" space for workers to pose questions, raise issues and feel a sense of ownership of their tasks.\n\nFurthermore, she said, healthcare leaders must build communication and decision-making infrastructures that foster departmental interaction and teamwork.\n\nHer ideas dovetail into suggestions published in a Med City News article earlier this year which emphasized 7 qualities of successful, high-functioning teams: Shared goals, clear roles and responsibilities, mutual trust, reliable execution of the game plan, ability to adapt quickly, individualized coaching and continuous learning.\n\nNon-physician partners are an integral part of successful healthcare team building and can help foster interdepartmental communication and \"merging complimentary skills\" to eliminate redundancies, FiercePracticeManagement previously reported.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read the HBR article\n\nRelated articles:\n\n7 qualities of high-functioning healthcare teams\n\n3 best practices for team-based care\n\nHospital boot camp teaches docs, nurses teamwork skills\n\nHow to spark doc-nurse communication\n\nNursing-pharmacy collaboration: How to find the sweet spot\n\n3 ways to make teamwork a reality rather than illusion", "article_metadata": {"description": "Healthcare providers to rethink the way they build and organize teams in order to foster collaboration and multidisciplinary approaches to complex problems.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Healthcare providers to rethink the way they build and organize teams in order to foster collaboration and multidisciplinary approaches to complex problems.", "title": "Healthcare success requires new type of team-building", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/healthcare-success-requires-new-type-team-building/2015-12-17", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Care Delivery,healthcare teams,hospital collaboration,team building", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery"}, "article_summary": "She advised healthcare teams to frame their work as a highly collaborative and complex process to get care providers thinking in terms of interdependency.\nNon-physician partners are an integral part of successful healthcare team building and can help foster interdepartmental communication and \"merging complimentary skills\" to eliminate redundancies, FiercePracticeManagement previously reported.\nFurthermore, she said, healthcare leaders must build communication and decision-making infrastructures that foster departmental interaction and teamwork.\n\"Teaming involves fluid, collaborative, interdependent work across shifting projects and with a shifting mix of partners, often across organizational boundaries.\"\nAs such, healthcare institutions are not constructed to serve the needs of patients and give them the best care."}
