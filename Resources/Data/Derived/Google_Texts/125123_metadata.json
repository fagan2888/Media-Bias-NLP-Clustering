The employee of Sherman Oaks Hospital was sentenced to two years' jail time along with 180 days of that two-year sentence under a supervised release. This is after having sex with a corpse, according to the Los Angeles district attorney's office, the Los Angeles Times reported.\n\nThe man, Alejandro Razo, 62, of Reseda, Calif., is also required to attend weekly counseling sessions and sex offender meetings. He was found having sex with the body of an 82-year-old woman, who had died of natural causes. Razo had been a nurse for more than 20 years at many different facilities, but this is the first time he was accused and convicted of any crime of the sort.\n\nHe was found guilty June 26 of having sex with the corpse, the prosecutors said. He was alone with the body in January 2013 and was supposed to prepare the body for the mortuary. Another nurse allegedly walked into the room to find Razo with his pants down as he had sex with the corpse. He was then arrested on charges of state health and safety code violations. Prosecutors used DNA evidence to finally convict him.\n\nRazo\u2019s fetish is known as necrophilia \u2014 when someone has a sexual attraction to a corpse. According to the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR), the official criteria for a proper diagnosis has to be when the incidents are recurrent. Court documents do not specify if Razo had previous incidents with other corpses.\n\nNecrophilia is wide in its definition and can extend to staring at a corpse and getting sexually aroused. According to Dr. Katherine Ramsland, \u201c for some people, that\u2019s what love is. For others, death and corpse violation just excite them,\u201d she writes in Psychology Today. \u201cThose who never touch the dead but find sexual gratification merely from looking at them are labeled \u2018platonic necrophilisists.\u2019 Some necrophiles are interested in only a particular part, including just the bones.\u201d\n\nSome professionals believe that a trigger for this might be a low self-esteem or a fear of rejection, which turns into desire. Information on Razo's mental state-of-being has not been reported.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "necrophilia, nurse, man, sentenced, 2, years, jail, after, he, had, sex, corpse", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A male nurse from California has been sentenced to two years after he was convicted of having sex with the corpse of an 82-year-old woman.", "title": "California Nurse Jailed For Having Sex With A Corpse", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/necrophilia-nurse-man-sentenced-2-years-jail-after-he-had-sex-corpse-291902", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/08/shutterstock192399446.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A male nurse from California has been sentenced to two years after he was convicted of having sex with the corpse of an 82-year-old woman.", "title": "California Nurse Jailed For Having Sex With A Corpse", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/necrophilia-nurse-man-sentenced-2-years-jail-after-he-had-sex-corpse-291902", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/08/shutterstock192399446.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/08/shutterstock192399446.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-07-08T13:37:02-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-08T13:37:01-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A male nurse from California has been sentenced to two years after he was convicted of having sex with the corpse of an 82-year-old woman."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde356\"", "article_summary": "This is after having sex with a corpse, according to the Los Angeles district attorney's office, the Los Angeles Times reported.\nA male nurse from California has been sentenced to two years after he was convicted of having sex with the corpse of an 82-year-old woman.\nHe was found guilty June 26 of having sex with the corpse, the prosecutors said.\nHe was found having sex with the body of an 82-year-old woman, who had died of natural causes.\nThe man, Alejandro Razo, 62, of Reseda, Calif., is also required to attend weekly counseling sessions and sex offender meetings."}
