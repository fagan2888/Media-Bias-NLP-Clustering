In April, we remember Washington’s call to action, celebrate the gains that have been made, and renew our shared commitment to the work that remains during National Minority Health Month. And as our families, neighborhoods, churches, schools and businesses band together to tackle the many barriers that still impede minority health, there are no nobler warriors to be found than those in our community health centers.

Indeed, community health centers (CHCs) serve some of the nation’s highest-risk, most medically vulnerable populations, with more than 70 percent of patients living below the federal poverty line. And more than two-thirds of the patients who seek care at CHCs are members of racial or ethnic minorities. In 2014, Hispanic patients made up 34 percent of the health center population, and African-Americans accounted for 23 percent.

That’s why when it comes to reducing disparities and truly reclaiming black health, CHCs are our best chance for success and our brightest hope for equity.

Not only do these sites provide vital access points to clinical care, regardless of a patient’s ability to pay, they also address the less visible, but equally important social determinants of health. In a coordinated effort with social service agencies and local nonprofits, CHCs work to alleviate food and housing insecurity, provide education and job training, and connect patients to proactive financial planning services.
