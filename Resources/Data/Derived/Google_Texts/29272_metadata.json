John Kasich's 19%, according to a survey released Thursday night by Fox Business Network.\n\nIt's the second consecutive major poll to show Cruz up by 10 percentage points in the state ahead of its primary on Tuesday. A Marquette Law School poll out Wednesday had Cruz at 40% to Trump's 30% and Kasich's 21%.\n\nWisconsin's primary is a key test of the Republican movement to stop Trump from seizing the 1,237 delegates necessary to clinch the party's nomination ahead of its convention in Cleveland in July.\n\nAfter the Badger State votes on Tuesday, the race shifts east, to terrain friendlier to Trump. New York holds its primary on April 19, followed by Pennsylvania, Maryland, Connecticut, Rhode Island and Delaware a week later.\n\nThe Fox Business Network telephone poll was conducted March 28-30 with live interviewers among a random sample of 1,602 Wisconsin voters selected from a statewide voter file. Results for the 742 likely Republican primary voters have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Texas senator has 42% support to Trump's 32% and Ohio Gov.
