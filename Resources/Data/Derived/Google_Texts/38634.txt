Just ahead of the White House Correspondents’ Association (WHCA) dinner, a guest list management app is naming the top spots in Washington to “witness political and social power.”

Zkipster says it analyzed check-in data and surveyed event planners and public relations gurus around the nation’s capital to come up with its list of 2015’s best venues.

POV, at the W hotel in downtown D.C., picked up “The View” award for offering the “best views” and “the hottest party vibes.”

The Hay-Adams Hotel, which sits just steps from the White House, — and is the home of a the long-running brunch held the morning after the correspondents’ dinner — got a nod for maintaining “its status as the go-to place to be in D.C.”

The Phillips Collection, the United States Institute of Peace, and Dock 5 at Union Market were also among the top venue picks.

Saturday’s WHCA dinner is considered the “it” social event of the season around the District.

“While many think of the nation’s capital as a reserved, buttoned-up seat of power, the reality is it is a vibrant, social town where the deal-making extends late into the evening,” Zkipster co-founder David Becker said in a news release announcing the results.
