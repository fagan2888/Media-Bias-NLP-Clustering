The ACA has benefited many people, but it certainly is not universal health care, and without a public option it has been called by Wendell Potter \"The Health Insurance Industry Profit Protection and Enhancement ACT.\" But it has provided some individuals life-saving benefits. We all must realize that politics is the art of the possible.\n\nAmendment 69 is a constitutional amendment to create a Colorado state publicly funded universal health-care system. It is not a single-payer system technically, but is a significant improvement over the ACA! It has many important reasons to be supported:\n\n\u2022 Reduces the uninsured rate to essentially zero (universal coverage).\n\n\u2022 Eliminates almost all underinsured.\n\n\u2022 Eliminates deductibles and large out-of-pocket expenses.\n\n\u2022 Allows patients full choice of primary care providers.\n\n\u2022 Comprehensive benefits, including all necessary health care services.\n\n\u2022 Is economical, transparent, and accountable.\n\n\u2022 It is truly affordable and doesn't impose penalties.\n\nAs a former member of the board of directors for HCAC and having worked with Dr. Irene Aguilar and other key people involved with ColoradoCare, I know it is a huge improvement over ACA and a major step in the right direction. Its success does rest on two critical conditions: Their ability to obtain federal waivers under ACA section 1332 and overcoming opposition from powerful insurance, pharmaceutical and elected state representatives.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI am not sure the political climate is right, but I am encouraged by the recent state wide school board election results. Just maybe the public is ready to take control of their future and finally say no to powerful special interests.\n\nRichard Hansen\n\nLoveland", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.reporterherald.com/opinion/letters/ci_29136731/coloradans-should-look-closely-at-amendment-69", "modificationDate": "2015-11-18T21:51:25-0700", "sailthru.section": "Letters to the Editor", "endDate": "2025-11-18T21:51:03-0700", "description": "This letter to the editor appeared in the Nov. 19, 2015, edition of the Reporter-Herald.", "ag": {"canon": "LovelandReporter-Herald:article:29136731:view"}, "startDate": "2015-11-18T21:51:03-0700", "og": {"url": "http://www.reporterherald.com/opinion/letters/ci_29136731/coloradans-should-look-closely-at-amendment-69", "image": "http://local.reporterherald.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/reporterherald.png", "type": "article", "description": "This letter to the editor appeared in the Nov. 19, 2015, edition of the Reporter-Herald.", "title": "Coloradans should look closely at Amendment 69"}, "twitter": {"domain": "reporterherald.com", "description": "This letter to the editor appeared in the Nov. 19, 2015, edition of the Reporter-Herald.", "title": "Coloradans should look closely at Amendment 69", "url": "http://www.reporterherald.com/opinion/letters/ci_29136731/coloradans-should-look-closely-at-amendment-69", "image": "http://local.reporterherald.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/reporterherald.png", "site": "@reporterherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-11-18T21:51:03-0700", "sailthru.title": "Coloradans should look closely at Amendment 69", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "google-site-verification": "XzsHDcJw4iXBQEYtDXFRaUAdKzxhSvxWMgXyQQNFFzg", "sailthru.site": "reporterherald.com", "pubDate": "2015-11-18T21:52:45-0700", "news_keywords": "Letters to the Editor, Letters to the Editor news, Loveland Colorado Letters to the Editor news, Loveland Colorado news, Letters to the Editor Loveland news, Letters to the Editor Colorado news, US Letters to the Editor news, world Letters to the Editor news."}, "article_summary": "Amendment 69 is a constitutional amendment to create a Colorado state publicly funded universal health-care system.\nHaving been a single-payer advocate for over 20 years and a critic of the Affordable Care Act, I am now ready to embrace Amendment 69.\n\u2022 Comprehensive benefits, including all necessary health care services.\nIt is not a single-payer system technically, but is a significant improvement over the ACA!\nJust maybe the public is ready to take control of their future and finally say no to powerful special interests."}
