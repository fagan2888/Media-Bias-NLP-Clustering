They\u2019ve voted more than 50 times to repeal or dismantle the law, roll back coverage for millions of Americans, and let insurers write their own rules again \u2013 all without proposing any viable alternatives. Now that the Supreme Court has once again re-affirmed the ACA as the law of the land, it\u2019s time for the Republican attacks to end. It\u2019s time to move on.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act isn\u2019t perfect, but the evidence is clear: it\u2019s working. Sixteen million Americans have gained coverage. Millions of young people are able to stay on their parents\u2019 plans. Insurance companies can no longer discriminate against people with preexisting conditions or charge women higher rates just because of their gender.\n\nRepublicans should stop trying to tear down the law and start working across party lines to build on these successes.\n\nI\u2019ve fought for the promise of quality, affordable health care for every American for decades. And I\u2019m not going to stop now. Anyone seeking to lead our country should stand up and support this decision.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#185f7c", "sailthru.author": "Colin Campbell", "application-name": "Business Insider", "twitter": {"description": "\"A great day!\"", "creator": "BKColin", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/hillary-clinton-on-obamacare-supreme-court-ruling-2015-6", "image": "http://static2.businessinsider.com/image/558c1890ecad047b2e839acd-506-253/yes-hillary-clinton-cheers-supreme-court-after-obamacare-ruling.jpg", "title": "'Yes!': Hillary Clinton cheers Supreme Court after Obamacare ruling", "site": "bi_politics", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.verticals": "politics,law", "linkedin": {"owner": "mid:1d5f7b"}, "sailthru.tags": "Hillary Clinton, 2016 Elections, Obamacare, Supreme Court, Colin Campbell", "description": "\"A great day!\"", "author": "Colin Campbell", "sailthru.date": "2015-06-25", "sailthru.title": "'Yes!': Hillary Clinton cheers Supreme Court after Obamacare ruling", "theme-color": "#185f7c", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://static6.businessinsider.com/image/558c18876bb3f73d2f839ace-50-50/yes-hillary-clinton-cheers-supreme-court-after-obamacare-ruling.jpg", "news_keywords": "Hillary Clinton, 2016 Elections, Obamacare, Supreme Court, Colin Campbell", "tbi-image": "http://static5.businessinsider.com/image/558c18876bb3f73d2f839ace/yes-hillary-clinton-cheers-supreme-court-after-obamacare-ruling.jpg", "fb": {"app_id": 155043519637}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://static1.businessinsider.com/assets/images/us/favicons/mstile-144x144.png?v=BI-US-2016-03-31", "date": "2015-06-25", "article": {"publisher": "businessinsider", "author": "http://www.businessinsider.com/author/colin-campbell"}, "sailthru.description": "\"A great day!\"", "viewport": "width=1024", "og": {"site_name": "Business Insider", "description": "\"A great day!\"", "title": "'Yes!': Hillary Clinton cheers Supreme Court after Obamacare ruling", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/hillary-clinton-on-obamacare-supreme-court-ruling-2015-6", "image": "http://static2.businessinsider.com/image/558c1890ecad047b2e839acd-1190-625/yes-hillary-clinton-cheers-supreme-court-after-obamacare-ruling.jpg", "type": "article"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Business Insider", "title": "'Yes!': Hillary Clinton cheers Supreme Court after Obamacare ruling", "sailthru.image.full": "http://static5.businessinsider.com/image/558c18876bb3f73d2f839ace/yes-hillary-clinton-cheers-supreme-court-after-obamacare-ruling.jpg", "tbi-vertical": "politics"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca694\"", "article_summary": "Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had an ecstatic reaction to Thursday's Supreme Court ruling that saved a critical component of Obamacare.\n-H \u2014 Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) June 25, 2015In a second post, she included a photo of her hugging President Barack Obama, in whose administration she used to serve.\nI\u2019ve fought for the promise of quality, affordable health care for every American for decades.\nSCOTUS affirms what we know is true in our hearts & under the law: Health insurance should be affordable & available to all.\nThe photo is the same one she posted earlier this year to celebrate the Affordable Care Act's fifth anniversary:A great day!"}
