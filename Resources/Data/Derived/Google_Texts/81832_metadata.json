The deadline forced the Board to make a decision all members said they would have preferred having more time to discuss and examine their options.\n\nHowever, R-6 Business Services Director Lori Boardman provided three options for the Board to consider.\n\nThe first option through HealthScope, which is the district's current third-party administration that deals for the district's health plan it has in place. For an estimated cost of $4,747, HealthScope would provide only the filing and reporting of the 1094 and 1095 forms, Boardman said.\n\n\"They don't do any type of ongoing monitoring of our staff,\" Boardman said of Health Scope. \"They don't monitor if an employee becomes eligible for the health benefit; that responsibility stays with us if we go with this option.\"\n\nLocal efforts in place to offset this liability include a \"sub-finder\" system, which helps limit substitute teachers to only 28 hours per week; and monitoring bus driver's hours, Boardman said. She estimated the pool of part-time employees is around 75.\n\nThere is a $3, one-time fee per person, and that includes tax-form creation, printing postage and mailing of the forms. There's also a $600 setup fee to get the process going along with possible additional prices. There is an hourly rate of $125 for any data collection of nonparticipants and any ongoing support for the district.\n\nThe pro for HealthScope was it's the most economical option, Boardman said. Cons were that it didn't include an online benefits platform and the liability stays with the district, she said.\n\nThe other two options Boardman presented Tuesday were from the vendor, Plan Source, which would be outsourced by the district. She presented two different cost options.\n\nThe first option would bring along not only ACA reporting but also an employee monitoring service, Boardman said. On top of that, they've created a benefit administration platform services.\n\nThis includes $6 per employee per month and a one-time setup fee of $3,852 along with a $4,282 look-back fee for a total of $38,948.\n\n\"You're looking at their ACA reporting for the 1094 and 1095 filing and look-back and look-forward monitoring services are just under $11,000. The benefit platform is $20,400.\n\nIn addition, liability goes to Plan Source, she said. Cost option No. 2 would include a $25,000 life insurance policy for all staff and the possibility for employees to purchase additional supplemental plans. The fees remain the same, and this cost is $37,354.\n\nThe con is either plan is an expensive cost when comparing to the cost of HealthScope, Boardman said.\n\n\"My opinion is anything we can do for a recruiting tool can help us down the road. ... We're talking about $5,000 or $40,000 today -- but we're talking overall with our health insurance, a $2 million-line item,\" Boardman said, adding $6,000 per employee is board-paid at 80 percent.\n\nBoardman said what she hears constantly from employees is that plan that works for one person doesn't work for another, and that person's plan doesn't work for a different person either.\n\n\"There are things to control our costs as we go forward and for future boards, I think it's crucial that we have some type of benefit platform so we can make it the employee's responsibility and privilege to shop what they need ... and they can pick and choose from multiple plans,\" Boardman said.\n\nAt the request of Superintendent Tom Williams, Boardman said she checked with area schools to see what they were using as ACA reporting services.\n\n\"With the exception of one district who will outsource completely with a third party, most everybody is going to be working with their current third-party administrator of their health plan to get their data and using Tyler Technologies software to do this,\" Boardman said.\n\nSikeston R-6 also uses Tyler Technologies, she noted.\n\n\"I don't want you to think I'm standing here saying we're going to get everything we need for the district from this $5,000 plan,\" Boardman said. \"That meets the criteria for ACA reporting.\n\nShe continued: \"I see in our near future needing a software program that we can enroll online and be able to provide info to our employees.\"\n\nThe price tag that comes along with that program is $20,000, she said.\n\nBoard member Rebecca Steward asked if there were other online employee vendors that offer the same service as Plan Source. Boardman said there was, but she was only familiar with Plan Source.\n\n\"Everything I've read about these fines and penalties is if you miss somebody, you are given the opportunity to correct it before you are fined,\" Steward said.\n\nSteward said it could make sense to wait on the more expensive option.\n\n\"We have a three-year contract with insurance that we're going to bid out (in the spring),\" Steward said. \"We can shop it between now and then and bid it out and have a whole package with interesting things that we determine that we want and have the time to look at different companies that might be doing this.\"\n\nBoard member Heather Drury said she couldn't justify going with the more expensive option.\n\n\"I cannot see how -- as a school district we would pay $30,000 to $40,000 for another company to do this, which is something we can do in our district,\" Drury said.\n\nBoardman reminded the board comparing HealthScope to Plan Source was not apples to apples.\n\n\"The $20,400 of outside of the setup costs for Plan Source is this online benefit platform,\" Boardman said. \"So what you're looking at basically if you went to HealthScope is $4,700, and when you pull out ACA reporting for Plan Source, it's about $10,000.\"\n\nSo the difference between HealthScope and Plan Source is both provide ACA reporting, but Plan Source also provides the look-back period and ongoing monitoring, Boardman said.\n\nBoard member Matt Tanner said basically it would cost the district $10,000 to remove the liability versus the $5,000 with HealthScope, which doesn't assume liability.\n\n\"For $5,000, we can shift liability?\" Tanner asked Boardman, who nodded. \"The bank I work for is a $2-billion company, and we shifted liability.\"\n\nTanner said the possibility of fines shouldn't be taken lightly.\n\n\"When the government throws down a fine, it's not in nickels and dimes,\" Tanner said. \"It's in $100-bills -- and lots of them. Then we hear: 'Jeez, guys. You could have spent $37,354. Now we have to to write a check for $750,000 to the IRS.\"\n\nIn closing, Boardman told the Board: \"My task in this -- and our administration has been criticized in the past for not being transparent and I take that very personal -- is exactly what my job is. My job is to bring to this Board of Education information from which they can make a decision. These are the options. It would have been negligent on my part had I not mentioned the liability so we have those options. I understand it's a big difference between $5,000 and $40,000.\"\n\nBoardman said she did think the district had the option to bid the other service later. She said there was nothing she could do about the self-imposed mid-September deadlines.\n\n\"I apologized last week for the tardiness in bringing this to the Board,\" Boardman said. \"We didn't have the information to talk about it any earlier. We knew the rules were coming. That's correct. We would have rolled with the punches and used what we had, but had I not brought these opportunities that have been presented to the Board, then I would not have been doing my job.\"\n\nBoard vice president Jim Gleason said his concern was about liability.\n\n\"I understand what you're saying, Rebecca,\" Gleason said. \"We might have a chance to correct it; we might not. It's unchartered waters. We, as a public body, have to be concerned about being not in compliance with the law. It's not like what's been done the last 5 to 10 years. It's all new.\"\n\nBoard member Amy Blanton agreed.\n\n\"There are lot of unknowns -- even though they are supposedly knowns,\" she said. \"The rules change and no one has any faith in the rules not changing.\"\n\nBoardman was asked if she felt comfortable without the liability protection.\n\n\"Every tool in our possession now is being utilized to its fullest to make sure we are in compliance. Can I Iook you in the eye and tell you that we won't miss someone? I can't do that,\" Boardman said.\n\nBoardman said she has very competent employees in her department, and they are spread very thin on a daily basis. However, they will monitor very closely, she said.\n\nTanner asked for a recommendation from the administration.\n\n\"I think I've given you all of the information I can, Matt,\" Boardman said. \"I have utilized every source I know to utilize. I'm always very conscious of spending public funds. I think I wished the deadline hadn't been imposed on us, and we could have hashed this out in several work sessions because that's the way I'm used to doing things.\n\nShe continued: \"I've been at Central Office for 14 years and in the district for 21 years and this is probably the toughest presentation I've had to make to the Board.\"\n\nThe issue was brought to the Board this month because of an ACA reporting issue, Boardman said.\n\n\"We have two viable options on the table to solve that. In one, we retain liability. In the other one, we don't,\" Boardman said.\n\nBy meeting's end, the board members agreed to approving the lower cost option to get filings completed but with the idea the Board may want to go forward with someone who would be both filing and offsetting liability in the future.\n\nWith the exception of Board President Deke Lape, who abstained, all board members voted in favor of using HealthScope's services for ACA reporting for an estimated $4,747.
