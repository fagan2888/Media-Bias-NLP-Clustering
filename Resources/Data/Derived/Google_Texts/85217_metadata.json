Author and legal scholar Ian Haney L\u00f3pez recently appeared on Moyers & Company to talk with Bill about his book, Dog Whistle Politics: How Coded Racial Appeals Have Reinvented Racism and Wrecked the Middle Class.\n\nPaul Ryan triggered a firestorm of recrimination this week. Speaking recently on Bill Bennett\u2019s Morning in America radio program, the Wisconsin Republican and self-styled budget wonk linked poverty to \u201cthis tailspin of culture, in our inner cities in particular, of men not working and just generations of men not even thinking about working or learning the value and the culture of work.\u201d\n\nSetting aside the factual claim \u2014 the notion that poverty is especially concentrated in America\u2019s inner cities is an increasingly antiquated one \u2014 these comments elicited a quick and forceful rebuke from Rep. Barbara Lee (D-CA), who decried them as \u201ca thinly veiled racial attack.\u201d She explained: \u201c[W]hen Mr. Ryan says \u2018inner city,\u2019 when he says, \u2018culture,\u2019 these are simply code words for what he really means: \u2018black.\u2019\u201d\n\nRyan has since backpedaled, protesting that race was nowhere in his thoughts: \u201cThis has nothing to do whatsoever with race. It never even occurred to me. This has nothing to do with race whatsoever.\u201d\n\nMaybe so, but there\u2019s a history here that the Republican Party can\u2019t ignore \u2014 one that explains why Lee was so quick to jump on his comments, why the Congressional Black Caucus announced themselves \u201cdeeply troubled\u201d by remarks they described as \u201chighly offensive\u201d and why so many others have sharply criticized Ryan.\n\nBy calling out his use of \u201ccode words,\u201d Lee put Ryan in the company of past politicians who have blown the proverbial dog whistle \u2014 using surreptitious references to race to garner support from anxious voters. Examples of dog whistling include Barry Goldwater\u2019s endorsement of \u201cstates\u2019 rights\u201d; Richard Nixon\u2019s opposition to \u201cforced busing\u201d; Ronald Reagan\u2019s blasts against \u201cwelfare queens\u201d; and George H.W. Bush\u2019s infamous Willie Horton ad.\n\nThese instances of racial pandering typically have been treated as disconnected eruptions, when in fact the GOP has made a concerted effort to win support through racial appeals. This pattern is so entrenched \u2014 and so well known \u2014 that two different chairs of the Republican National Committee have acknowledged and apologized for this strategy.\n\n\u201cBy the seventies and into the eighties and nineties,\u201d RNC chair Ken Mehlman said in a 2005 speech before the NAACP, \u201cRepublicans gave up on winning the African-American vote, looking the other way or trying to benefit politically from racial polarization. I am here today as the Republican chairman to tell you we were wrong.\u201d Five years later, his successor Michael Steele similarly acknowledged that \u201cfor the last 40-plus years we had a \u2018Southern Strategy\u2019 that alienated many minority voters by focusing on the white male vote in the South.\u201d\n\nDespite the mea culpas, race baiting has continued: recall New Gingrich\u2019s 2012 tarring of Barack Obama as \u201cthe best food-stamp president in American history.\u201d Or consider another Gingrich jibe from the last election: \u201cReally poor children in really poor neighborhoods have no habits of working and have nobody around them who works,\u201d he claimed. \u201cSo they literally have no habit of showing up on Monday. They have no habit of staying all day. They have no habit of \u2018I do this and you give me cash,\u2019 unless it\u2019s illegal.\u201d\n\nWhat, then, of Paul Ryan? Was he dog whistling? To many, his strong echoing of Gingrich, coupled with the larger GOP history of racial pandering, suggested so. Nor did Ryan help himself by invoking the conservative scholar Charles Murray \u2014 a man who co-wrote a controversial 1994 book, The Bell Curve, tying intelligence to race, and who in 2000 explained that genetics will likely show, \u201cOne reason that we still have poverty in the United States is that a lot of poor people are born lazy.\u201d\n\nBut what of Ryan\u2019s insistence he did not consider race whatsoever, or his later explanation that he had been \u201cinarticulate\u201d in his comments? Perhaps Ryan genuinely did not recognize the racial narrative embedded in his remarks about an inner city culture that devalues work. But at best, this suggests that Ryan has uncritically adopted the charged rhetoric of his party without understanding its racial undertones.\n\nLess charitably, in weighing Ryan\u2019s protestations of innocence, we should be clear that denying racial intent is par for the course in dog whistling. The whole point of speaking in coded terms is to transmit racial messages that can be defended as not about race at all. Today\u2019s broadly shared anti-racist ethos condemns naked appeals to racial solidarity; those politicians who nevertheless seek to trade on racial provocations must do so in ways that maintain plausible deniability.\n\nAnother defense is to insist that Ryan is no bigot. Here\u2019s one version, from Republican political strategist Ron Christie: \u201cRep. Paul Ryan (R-WI) is not racist nor did he blow a \u2018dog whistle\u2019 to launch a thinly veiled racist attack against black people. I offer this from the perspective of someone who has known Paul for more than 20 years: there is not a racist bone in his body.\u201d The fact that Christie is black no doubt lends credibility to his testimony.\n\nIan Haney L\u00f3pez on Dog Whistle Politics\n\nBut this retort misses the point. Dog whistling is not rooted in fiery hatred but rather in cool calculation \u2014 it\u2019s the strategic, carefully considered decision to win votes by stirring racial fears in society. Suppose we stipulate that Ryan is no bigot. So what? The question is not one of animus on Ryan\u2019s part, but of whether \u2014 as a tactical matter \u2014 he sought to garner support by indirectly stimulating racial passions.\n\nOf course, an individual\u2019s mindset in any particular instance is almost impossible to know. We cannot be certain what Ryan intended. Nevertheless, there\u2019s no doubt that Ryan employed rhetoric closely connected to a dismal history of Republican racial demagoguery.\n\nBarbara Lee was correct to respond forcefully. In our political culture, dog whistling all too often takes the form of warnings about a \u201ctailspin of culture\u201d in the \u201cinner cities\u201d and \u201cgenerations of men not even thinking about working.\u201d Sharply rebuked, hopefully Ryan and others will think twice \u2014 or, if Ryan is to be believed, then think for the first time \u2014 about using political rhetoric imbued with ugly racial stereotypes.", "article_metadata": {"description": "He insists not, but the author of Dog Whistle Politics hopes he\u2019s learned his lesson.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "BillMoyers.com", "description": "He insists not, but the author of Dog Whistle Politics hopes he\u2019s learned his lesson.", "title": "Is Paul Ryan Racist? | BillMoyers.com", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://dy00k1db5oznd.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/AP749754764273_crop.jpg", "height": 360}, "updated_time": "2014-10-07T13:37:55-04:00", "url": "http://billmoyers.com/2014/03/16/is-paul-ryan-racist/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "He insists not, but the author of Dog Whistle Politics hopes he\u2019s learned his lesson.", "creator": "@IanHaneyLopez", "image": "http://dy00k1db5oznd.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/AP749754764273_crop.jpg", "title": "Is Paul Ryan Racist? | BillMoyers.com", "site": "@BillMoyersHQ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "article": {"section": "Blog", "tag": "widget", "published_time": "2014-03-16T09:59:35-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-07T13:37:55-04:00"}, "pubdate": 20140316, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd025e\"", "article_summary": "Paul Ryan (R-WI) is not racist nor did he blow a \u2018dog whistle\u2019 to launch a thinly veiled racist attack against black people.\nNevertheless, there\u2019s no doubt that Ryan employed rhetoric closely connected to a dismal history of Republican racial demagoguery.\nThey have no habit of \u2018I do this and you give me cash,\u2019 unless it\u2019s illegal.\u201dWhat, then, of Paul Ryan?\nPerhaps Ryan genuinely did not recognize the racial narrative embedded in his remarks about an inner city culture that devalues work.\nExamples of dog whistling include Barry Goldwater\u2019s endorsement of \u201cstates\u2019 rights\u201d; Richard Nixon\u2019s opposition to \u201cforced busing\u201d; Ronald Reagan\u2019s blasts against \u201cwelfare queens\u201d; and George H.W."}
