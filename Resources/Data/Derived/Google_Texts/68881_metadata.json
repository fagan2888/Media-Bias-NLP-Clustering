Gov. Anthony Brown (D) waves from the gallery in 2015 as he waits to watch Larry Hogan (R) take the oath of office to become the 62nd governor of Maryland. (Patrick Semansky/AP)\n\nThis is the first in a series of profiles of the six candidates seeking the Democratic nomination to represent Maryland\u2019s 4th Congressional District.\n\nIn the middle of his grueling 2014 gubernatorial campaign, Anthony G. Brown paused to bury his father, a Jamaican immigrant who had built a medical practice on Long Island.\n\nAmong Roy Brown\u2019s belongings was a box of invoices with the payment lines blank and a note from a patient, thanking him for debts he had forgiven.\n\n\u201cHe was rewarded in the satisfaction of knowing that he made a difference in the lives of the people he touched,\u201d Brown recalled recently, his eyes watering as he looked away. \u201cThat\u2019s the kind of life I want.\u201d\n\nThere is little voters don\u2019t know about Brown the politician, who after years as a state delegate and lieutenant governor has the highest name recognition \u2014 and arguably the strongest governing credentials \u2014 of any of the six Democrats running to represent Maryland\u2019s 4th Congressional District. (Several Republicans are also running, but the district is overwhelmingly Democratic, and whoever wins that party\u2019s nomination will be heavily favored in November.)\n\n[For Anthony Brown, discipline and detail are key]\n\nAds from the governor\u2019s race described Brown\u2019s Ivy League education and decorated military career; his meteoric rise from first-term delegate to majority whip in the state legislature; and his deep dedication to public service.\n\nBut Brown\u2019s stiff persona during that campaign meant few voters saw what supporters describe as his warm personal side. \u201cPeople wanted to touch and feel their governor,\u201d said former delegate Aisha Braveboy (D), a friend of Brown\u2019s. \u201cI don\u2019t think the campaign gave people an opportunity to see who he was as a person.\u201d\n\nBrown lost the governor\u2019s race to Republican Larry Hogan by four percentage points, an embarrassing defeat in a state where registered Democrats outnumber Republicans more than 2 to 1. A few months later, when Rep. Donna F. Edwards (D-Md.) decided to give up her seat in Congress to run for Senate, Brown saw his chance for political redemption.\n\n\u201cSometimes in life you are going to get knocked down,\u201d Brown says, reciting words he\u2019d heard his father say. \u201cBut you have to pick yourself up and stay in the fight.\u201d\n\n\n\nCongressional hopeful Anthony Brown, right, speaks at a candidates\u2019 forum in February. Terence Strait, another Democratic candidate, looks on. (Mark Gail/For The Washington Post)\n\nAt the start of the congressional race, Brown seemed less determined than some of his competitors, sending fewer emails and staying largely silent on social media. His fundraising was sluggish.\n\nHe has picked up the pace in the new year. But with just a few weeks to go before the primary, it is unclear whether that will be enough.\n\n[Contest to succeed Edwards dominated by three veteran politicians]\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 54-year-old father of three says he is trying to reveal more about himself to voters in the district, which is anchored in densely populated Prince George\u2019s County and stretches into more rural Anne Arundel County.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been talking directly to voters, we\u2019ve knocked on thousands of doors, made 20,000 phone calls,\u201d said campaign manager Derrick Green. \u201cWhen they talk to him on the street, some people have said \u2018We\u2019ve got your back this time.\u2019 \u201d\n\nDuring a recent interview, Brown spoke extensively about his upbringing and his racial identity. He talked about his father being the result of a one-night stand in Cuba. He went into detail about the challenges his parents experienced as an interracial couple \u2014 a topic he was not willing to discuss when he was vying to become the first African American governor of Maryland.\n\nAs a politician of color, he says now, \u201cYou have to step up and fulfill those expectations that you are going to be the advocate, the champion.\u201d\n\nEarl Adams Jr., Brown\u2019s former chief of staff, said the candidate seems like a \u201ctotally different guy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is the Anthony Brown wearing out the shoe leather as if he literally just arrived in the district,\u201d Adams said. \u201cHe wants people to get to know him.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn 2012, Lt. Gov. Anthony G. Brown, left, Gov. Martin O'Malley and House Speaker Michael E.

(Linda Davidson/THE WASHINGTON POST)\n\nBrown\u2019s critics say he had few stand-alone accomplishments in eight years as deputy to then-Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley (D), and one glaring failure: He was responsible for overseeing the state\u2019s implementation of President Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act, including a deeply flawed sign-up website that crashed on the day it debuted.The state had to fire its contractor and painstakingly rebuild the system.\n\nBrown is apologetic about the failure, but also says he delegated responsibility for the site and was unaware of the problems with vendors. He routinely tells voters he is \u201cnot going to talk about what I\u2019ve done, but what I will do\u201d if elected to Congress.\n\nWhen pressed, he says that he shepherded laws in the House of Delegates that boosted aid for veterans, led to tort reform and helped victims of domestic violence.\n\nHe also touts O\u2019Malley administration initiatives to legalize same-sex marriage, abolish the death penalty and tighten gun control.\n\nBrown reminds voters it was the O\u2019Malley administration that placed a moratorium on foreclosures that helped many Prince George\u2019s homeowners during the worst of the housing bust.\n\nIf elected, Brown says, he will focus on constituent services, securing federal dollars and contracts for local businesses and protecting programs such as Social Security.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s less about the past and that the fact he ran for governor,\u201d Green said. \u201cIt\u2019s more about the future and that people believe he will fight for them in Congress.\u201d\n\nNext: 4th District candidate Warren Christopher (D).", "article_metadata": {"description": "The former lieutenant governor, now running to represent Maryland\u2019s 4th Congressional District, is talking about topics he avoided during his unsuccessful bid for governor.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/arelis.r.hernandez", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The former lieutenant governor, now running to represent Maryland\u2019s 4th Congressional District, is talking about topics he avoided during his unsuccessful bid for governor.", "title": "As he seeks a seat in Congress, Anthony Brown says he wants to reveal more of himself this time", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/md-politics/anthony-brown-wants-voters-to-forget-his-failed-bid-for-governor-and-focus-on-what-he-could-do-for-them-in-congress/2016/03/20/06ec2d18-df79-11e5-846c-10191d1fc4ec_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2016/03/17/Local-Politics/Images/Hogan_Inauguration-05ffc.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@arelisrhdz"}, "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "mdpolitics, anthony brown, maryland's 4th congressional district, elections 2016, maryland 2016, martin o'malley, larry hogan, anthony brown governor, ppinclude", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/arelis.r.hernandez"}, "eomportal-uuid": "06ec2d18-df79-11e5-846c-10191d1fc4ec", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "mdpolitics, anthony brown, maryland's 4th congressional district, elections 2016, maryland 2016, martin o'malley, larry hogan, anthony brown governor, ppinclude"}, "article_summary": "\u201cBut you have to pick yourself up and stay in the fight.\u201dCongressional hopeful Anthony Brown, right, speaks at a candidates\u2019 forum in February.\nAnthony Brown (D) waves from the gallery in 2015 as he waits to watch Larry Hogan (R) take the oath of office to become the 62nd governor of Maryland.\ndecided to give up her seat in Congress to run for Senate, Brown saw his chance for political redemption.\nIn the middle of his grueling 2014 gubernatorial campaign, Anthony G.
