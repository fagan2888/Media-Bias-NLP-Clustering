Colorado’s health insurance exchange is making a last-minute push to sign people up for coverage and warning of tax penalties if they don’t.

For most people, Sunday is the deadline to purchase a policy. Federal tax credits for doing so are available only through Connect for Health Colorado, the state’s health insurance marketplace.

The exchange plans to open its downtown store, at 1600 California St. on the mall, from noon to 6 p.m. on Sunday to accommodate last-minute customers.

People can also check the Connect for Health Colorado events calendar, talk to a health insurance broker or call the exchange at 855-752-6749.

The exchange planned to extend its hours to 10 p.m. Friday and midnight Saturday and Sunday.

“We know from experience that we will see a number of customers in these final days of open enrollment,” said Kevin Patterson, the exchange chief. “But I want to emphasize it is time to act. There are just a few days left for Coloradans to get covered in 2016. The penalty for going without coverage this year has increased.”

People who lost plans, such as customers of the closed Colorado HealthOP, will have until Feb. 29 to sign up for coverage that begins Mar. 1.

The federal tax penalty for going without coverage is expected to average nearly $1,000 per household, depending on 2016 income.

Exchange spokesman Luke Clarke said nearly 140,000 people had signed up through mid-January. Sixty-two percent are returning customers, and the rest are new.

Additionally, about 45,000 people had qualified for Medicaid through the exchange as of mid-January.

The Colorado Health Institute reported last year that expanded Medicaid eligibility had driven a huge increase in health coverage, but estimated that several hundred thousand people remain uninsured.

Clarke said last-minute applicants who fail to get an immediate decision will be accommodated. “We can get them in,” he said.
