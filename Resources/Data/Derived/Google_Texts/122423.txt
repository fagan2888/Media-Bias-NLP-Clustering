Children who get health insurance through Medicaid go to the dentist about half as often as children in Florida who have private insurance, according to a new study out from the American Dental Association and the Health Policy Institute.

There are plenty of dentists in Florida, but only about 10 percent accept Medicaid, said study co-author Marko Vujicic. On average, Medicaid pays about a third of what private insurance pays.

“To me as an economist, it’s not rocket science,” Vujicic said. “If you design the policy parameters in such a way that it becomes difficult for the providers to participate you are not able to leverage all that excess capacity in the system that clearly exists in my view.”
