Ricky Schroder and Kirk Cameron smiled down on us as my neighbor Rebecca took minutes with a multicolored click-pen.\n\nWe had gathered to discuss \u201cFull House,\u201d a sitcom in which a recently widowed man named Danny Tanner teaches his three adorable daughters very important life lessons, with the help of his brother-in-law and best friend. The show was the perfect answer for little girls who had enjoyed the wacky nontraditional family structure they saw in the 1987 film \u201c3 Men and a Baby\u201d and thought, \u201cI\u2019ll raise you two more kids.\u201d The members of my \u201cFull House\u201d Club assembled for important business like practicing Baby Michelle\u2019s latest catchphrase and debating whether D. J. Tanner\u2019s scrunchies were boss.\n\nThis was my childhood in the late 1980s and early \u201990s, a time that, hairstyle-wise, and even teen-idol-wise, is perhaps better forgotten. But it will not be. Especially not now. Our nostalgia is greedy. It\u2019s not enough to look back fondly on the past; now we are rebooting it. Our nostalgia compels us to go beyond rewatching dusty old VCR tapes, to actually wanting fleeting childhood obsessions to be revived and re-enacted to fit our own times. This is why Netflix\u2019s announcement this spring that it would air a 13-episode continuation of \u201cFull House\u201d in 2016 made my inner 9-year-old swoon, even though adult me remains wary. Some of the original cast may officially be on board for \u201cFuller House,\u201d but like Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, who jointly portrayed Michelle Tanner, I am not.\n\nIn an era in which Throwback Thursday is one of the most crowd-pleasing hashtags on Instagram, even the cheesiest popular-culture references from the semi-recent past can feel oddly profound. I am not immune to downing nostalgia like Pop Rocks when I read listicles about how to identify oneself as a child of the \u201980s and \u201990s, or when I have an overwrought response to the trailer for the live action film version of the 1980s rock band cartoon \u201cJem,\u201d which is set to debut this October. (How can the film ignore Jem\u2019s rival band, the glam-rock goddesses the Misfits? A travesty!)\n\nPernicious nostalgia is why the YouTube video for the February 2015 \u201cSaved by the Bell\u201d reunion on \u201cThe Tonight Show With Jimmy Fallon\u201d has more than 30 million views. It\u2019s why reboots of \u201c21 Jump Street\u201d and \u201cTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\u201d have turned TV shows I enjoyed as a kid into successful movie franchises. And it helps explain why Lifetime is bringing us \u201cThe Unauthorized Full House Story\u201d next month, and why it just announced the same unauthorized movie treatment for \u201cBeverly Hills, 90210.\u201d\n\n\u201cNostalgia, as always, had wiped away bad memories and magnified the good ones. No one was safe from its onslaught,\u201d Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez writes in his memoir \u201cLiving to Tell the Tale,\u201d and certainly the revisiting of middling \u201990s TV shows helps to perpetuate myths of a simpler time, when sitcoms had laugh tracks and catchy theme songs and very little complexity. \u201cFull House\u201d was a gooey American fairy tale during a time when my favorite color was \u201cpinkandpurple,\u201d the kind of adorable disaster that was brilliantly skewered in the 2014 Netflix animated series \u201cBoJack Horseman,\u201d in which the title character is a former family sitcom star with a dark side.\n\n\u201cFull House\u201d was also one of the last shows that existed solidly off the Internet during its seven-year run, from 1987 to 1995. Today, GIFs of Baby Michelle saying \u201cYou got it dude\u201d can be found quite easily along with episode-by-episode recaps, and even steamy fan fiction titled \u201cUncle Jesse\u2019s Adventures.\u201d But when \u201cFull House\u201d originally aired, the club meetings in my bedroom may have been the forum where the most passionate displays of fandom could be found.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOur most direct way to engage with the show was to write gushing letters to John Stamos, care of ABC, with the hope that an autographed headshot might one day show up in our parents\u2019 mailboxes. Since then the Internet has empowered fans to have more access to and control over the shows they love. Technology evolves rapidly enough that the definition of what it means to be a fan changes constantly. Our analog forms of fandom seem as quaint as D. J. Tanner\u2019s hair accessories, and so perhaps my nostalgia for the recent past is fueled by the desire to revisit old loves with new tools, to be a 2015 fan of things I loved as a tween.\n\nFor the past six years I have used my own particular form of Internet fandom to pay tribute to my favorite TV shows and authors on Tumblr. I run a blog called Slaughterhouse 90210, in which I juxtapose images from TV shows with quotes from literature to comment on both and to create something that\u2019s entirely new.\n\nFor better or worse, my earnest adoration of the \u201990s nighttime soap \u201cBeverly Hills, 90210\u201d has become something of a calling card for me and my blog, a way to define myself in the present by what captivated me in the past. How disappointing, then, when the CW reboots of \u201c90210\u201d and its more mature spiritual twin \u201cMelrose Place\u201d felt equally unfulfilling both to watch on TV and to follow as a fan with an Internet presence.\n\n(That said, some pop-culture return engagements seem more promising. I am optimistic that the \u201cTwin Peaks\u201d revival, which is in the works for Showtime, is ideal for this time of intense Internet fandom. It\u2019s complex enough to sustain dozens of close reads and fan conspiracy theories.)\n\nAlas, I will never be 9 years old in 1987 ever again, and though it\u2019s fun to romanticize the past, I don\u2019t want to mistake fondness for excellence. It\u2019s like looking at a photo of an old childhood crush and realizing that everything you loved about him was probably stuff you\u2019d made up in your head.\n\nMuch like my friendships with the other members of my Full House Club, whom I sporadically see in my Facebook feed with their own 9-year-olds, my fandom seems unsustainable now.\n\nBetter, then, to let the children of today discover and obsess about their own TV shows. Don\u2019t remake the sweet smarm of our youth. I\u2019ll be fine without it. I can always read up on some Uncle Jesse and Uncle Joey fan-fic if ever I\u2019m feeling sentimental.", "article_metadata": {"ad-sponsor": "Nostalgia", "tone": "opinion", "ptime": 20150711143005, "twitter": {"description": "We want to be 2015 fans of the shows we loved as kids \u2014 but let\u2019s resist the impulse to reboot.", "title": "What Type of Nostalgic \u201990s TV Fan Are You?
