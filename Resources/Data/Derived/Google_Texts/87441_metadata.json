He is part of a small but growing group of first-generation farmers in California. Now Stowers has run into some issues operating his business, mainly in the form of the city receiving complaints about signage posted in a residential area near his farm. Stowers has been running the tiny farm since March, about the same time Sacramento approved new ordinances to accommodate urban farmers.\n\nSacramento\u2019s new codes look to create opportunities for a generation seemingly short on farmers. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, the average American farmer is 57 years old. Costs associated with acquiring large lots of rural land are prohibitive to many, making urban environments the most accessible and pragmatic.\n\n\u201cMy family didn\u2019t have land to give me or anything,\u201d Stowers explained. \u201cI\u2019m from California. That\u2019s expensive. There\u2019s a lot of hurdles to get over.\u201d\n\nRoseville\u2019s current ordinances do not provide for customer contact or off-sight signage for home-based businesses, according to city staff.\n\nCity of Roseville Planning Manager Gregg Bitter told the Press Tribune those will be part of policy considerations as the city responds to Stowers\u2019 public statements.\n\n\u201cWe need to look at parking, traffic, signage, all of these issues,\u201d Bitter said. \u201cOne of the reasons our home-based businesses don\u2019t allow for customer contact is we want to maintain that residential character\u2026It could be a fundamental shift in the way we look at home-based businesses.\u201d\n\nFarmers markets are one option for people like Stowers, but like other traditional farming environments, they require capitol investments, greenhouse costs, infrastructure, soil testing, participation fees, water supply and transportation.\n\nAccording to the United States Department of Agriculture, 23.5 million Americans do not live within one mile of a supermarket. A rise in the number of urban farmers may provide a convenient opportunity for residents to purchase in their own neighborhoods.\n\nUnder the terms of Sacramento\u2019s new ordinances, customers may merely walk across the street to a neighbor\u2019s home and legally purchase produce.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking into it,\u201d Bitter said. \u201cWe\u2019re still in the fact-finding stage so that we can provide information to the city council to see if this is something they want to pursue \u2026We have looked through what Sacramento did, and I think it\u2019s more limited than what some people realize.\u201d\n\nRoseville\u2019s current zoning ordinances allow for \u201ca non-residential business activity carried on within a dwelling by its inhabitants \u2026 that does not change the character of the surrounding residential area by generating more traffic or storage of materials than would normally be expected in a residential zone.\u201d\n\nRoseville staff will also examine the policy of West Sacramento and other nearby cities. There is no immediate plan to bring an item on urban farming to the Roseville City Council\u2019s agenda, though members of the city\u2019s staff expect to be far more familiar with the issue when it does come up.\n\n\u201cThe end result is going be to provide our city manger\u2019s office and the city council with information on what other jurisdictions are doing, maybe describe the differences on how their codes are set up and see if they want us to contemplate this,\u201d Bitter emphasized. \u201cI imagine this would require quite a bit of public outreach\u2026There are folks out there that would like to take advantage of this, and there\u2019s also are folks who don\u2019t necessarily want a farm stand and folks driving up and down their residential streets purchasing produce. I think we need to take all of that into consideration.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"geo.region": "US", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "geo.position": "37.09024;-95.712891", "robots": "index, follow", "fb": {"app_id": 169449507770}, "ICBM": "37.09024, -95.712891", "keywords": "news, the press tribune,local news, Roseville News, Granite Bay news, national news, state news, breaking news, crime log, sports, national sports, local sports, classifieds, Roseville photos, Roseville health, Roseville fitness, Roseville dinning guide,ski Roseville report, Roseville sports score, living, Roseville arts, Roseville entertainment", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Local Roseville news.
