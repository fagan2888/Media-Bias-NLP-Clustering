The insurer warned Wednesday that it plans to leave some states, saying it\u2019s preparing to boost premiums in an effort to make a profit on sales of policies under the ACA.\n\n\n\nUnitedHealth, the biggest U.S. health insurance company, has already said it will pull out of ACA exchanges in at least 26 of the 34 states where it sold 2016 coverage and expects to lose $650 million this year on Obamacare plans. The two companies\u2019 retreat suggests that the health program, intended to increase individuals\u2019 access to private coverage, has some serious drawbacks for insurers, said Robert Laszewski, an industry consultant.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf you thought it was going to get fixed in a year or two, you\u2019d stick around,\u201d said Laszewksi, who runs Health Policy and Strategy Associates. \u201cThe implications of that are that the program just isn\u2019t working in its current form.\u201d\n\nSole Choice\n\n\n\nAfter UnitedHealth and Humana leave at the end of this year, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Alabama will be the sole choice on the state\u2019s individual Obamacare market. While other plans could still choose to sell in the state, Mark Fowler, chief of staff at the Alabama Department of Insurance, said he\u2019s not aware of any.\n\n\n\nHumana, slated for acquisition by Aetna Inc., said Wednesday that members who stayed with the company\u2019s individual Obamacare policies from 2015 to 2016 were more likely to be hospitalized or use pharmaceuticals than those who had plans and dropped them, contributing to increased costs. The company set aside $176 million in the fourth quarter to cover losses expected from ACA business this year, and added another $13 million to those reserves in the first quarter.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere are a number of persistent issues that hinder our ability to offer an affordable, high quality and attractive individual insurance product,\u201d Tom Noland, a company spokesman, said by email. He said the insurer will make changes to its product offerings, without specifying them. Humana hasn\u2019t said which state markets it plans to leave.\n\n\u2018Similar Path\u2019\n\n\n\nHumana is a relatively small player in the ACA, with about 554,300 individual members from the exchanges as of March 31. About 12.7 million people picked ACA plans for this year in the government-run markets.\n\n\n\nThe company offers Obamacare plans in 15 states and overlaps with UnitedHealth mainly in Southern states including Alabama, Georgia and Tennessee, according to Cynthia Cox, who studies the ACA and private health plans at the Kaiser Family Foundation. Regulators in Texas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana and Missouri, all of which UnitedHealth is leaving, said Humana hasn\u2019t told them of its plans.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe see Humana following a similar path as UnitedHealth for 2017 and expect the company will significantly reduce its overall exposure to the struggling public exchange marketplace,\u201d Scott Fidel, an analyst at Credit Suisse Group AG, said in a research note.\n\n\u2018Two Choices\u2019\n\n\n\nHumana will continue to sell on Tennessee\u2019s individual exchange, though it won\u2019t sell ACA-compliant plans off the exchange, according to that state\u2019s insurance regulator. While Humana has indicated it\u2019s discontinuing some offerings in Colorado, it isn\u2019t clear whether it\u2019s exiting the state\u2019s Obamacare market, an insurance official said. States have different deadlines for plans to file their 2017 rates, and for making them public.\n\n\n\nIn Mississippi, where UnitedHealth is pulling out of the exchange, Humana is staying. The state\u2019s insurance regulator has also asked the company to sell Obamacare plans in two additional counties for next year to foster competition.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt would be good if we had at least two choices in every county,\u201d Mike Chaney, the state\u2019s insurance commissioner, said by phone.\n\nFaring Better\n\n\n\nOther insurers have fared better in Obamacare, or said they plan to stick it out longer. Centene Corp., which specializes in insuring low-income Medicaid patients, has said it\u2019s seeking to expand its profitable exchange business. Aetna is looking to break even on its exchange business this year.\n\n\n\nIndianapolis-based Anthem Inc. is \u201cwell positioned for continued growth in the exchange marketplace if the market stabilizes,\u201d CEO Joseph Swedish said last week.\n\n\n\nHumana said that in states where it stays, it may increase Obamacare plan prices. As medical costs rise and government programs designed to support the ACA\u2019s establishment expire, plans across the U.S. may have to boost their rates by a minimum of about 12 percent, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.\n\n\n\nConsumers may see these higher costs and limited options just as they\u2019re picking President Barack Obama\u2019s replacement.
