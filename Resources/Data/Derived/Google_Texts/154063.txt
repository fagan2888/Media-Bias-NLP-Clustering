POLITICO GOES GLOBAL: Europe edition launches this spring with team of 70; Budoff Brown to Brussels – INTERVIEW: Reid blames Obamacare rollout for costing Dems the majority

Good Wednesday morning. At this moment, Publisher Robert Allbritton and other Politico executives are speaking to a massive news conference (300 RSVPs) in Brussels, Belgium, seat of the European Union, to unveil the first stage our global expansion: a European edition of Politico, launching this spring with a team of 70, as a joint venture with Brussels-based Axel Springer, Europe’s largest news publisher. POLITICO Europe will be based in Berlin, with reporters in major capitals, and newsrooms and business presences in Berlin and Paris. The goal: to create the largest most influential political and policy publication on the Continent.

The takeaways: 1) The new venture bought European Voice, the dominant publication now covering the EU, and a related Paris-based global events business, DII. Both are PROFITABLE. From the release, off embargo at 7 a.m.: “The acquisition is a cornerstone of POLITICO's drive to become the leading new media publication on European politics and policy.”

2) Matthew Kaminski, a member of the Wall Street Journal Editorial Board who lived in Europe for 15 years, has been hired as Executive Editor. He will launch with 30 reporters and editors, and scale up from there. Kaminski will report to Politico co-founder and Editor-in-Chief John F. Harris, who will oversee the vision and execution of Politico’s European newsroom, as chairman of the joint venture’s editorial committee.

3) Other leadership: Bill Nichols, Politico editor-at-large, will be the joint venture’s founding editor-at-large. Florian Eder, EU correspondent for Axel Springer’s Die Welt, will be a managing editor. Carrie Budoff Brown, senior White House reporter for POLITICO, will become associate editor and senior reporter. POLITICO’s Gabe Brotman will oversee strategy and business development.

4) The venture will include a website, POLITICO.eu; Euro versions of Playbook and Politico Pro; a weekly paper; and conferences and events in Brussels, Paris, Berlin and elsewhere. The European edition of POLITICO Pro, like its U.S. counterpart, will be a subscription policy news service covering financial services, technology, health care, energy and more.

5) The owner and publisher of European Voice, Shéhérazade Semsar-de Boisséson, will run the new business as Managing Director. Playbook got to meet Shéhérazade on a Brussels trip this fall. She has Europe wired, and is fun to drink wine with.

--PICS by Danielle Jones: John Harris and Jim VandeHei in Berlin yesterday http://bit.ly/1yzHhJS ... Robert Allbritton, on the news-conference stage in Brussels this a.m. http://bit.ly/1Iz5lod

JIM VANDEHEI, Politico president and CEO, emails the staff with a Brussels dateline and the subject line, “Big, Breaking Brussels News”: The purchase of European Voice “provides us instant talent and presence in Brussels ? and an attractive subscriber base in the EU Parliament. ... [O]ur European operation has the same ambitions as all of us here: dominate coverage of our core areas and build a durable and profitable business to sustain great, nonpartisan journalism. ...

“We are about to go on a hiring spree with the aim of locking up the top editorial and business talent in Europe. DANIELLE JONES, who is helping guide expansion for us back here, plans to keep all of you informed on every important new hire or dimension to our expansion.” Text of Jim’s email http://bit.ly/1AeDhR9 ... Jim speaks in Berlin yesterday (Pic by Gabe Brotman) http://bit.ly/1qui4m9

BIG PICTURE: Politico Publisher Robert Allbritton put CEO VandeHei in charge of the business just over one year ago, and promised rapid change and growth. Since that day: They bought Capital New York and built largest political staff in the state; put editor Susan Glasser in charge of Washington, and expanded Politico Magazine; partnered with Axel Springer, Europe’s largest news publisher; and purchased European Voice and its companion events business. Because they smartly expanded the leadership team, Editor-in-Chief John Harris will have the time and support to help guide the Euro expansion with frequent trips overseas. #globaldomination.

TORTURE INTERVIEW -- “Michael Hayden Is Not Sorry: The Senate report rakes Bush’s former CIA director over the coals. He fires back,” by Politico Magazine’s Michael Hirsh: “Hirsh: The report concludes ... [that a]ccording to CIA records, ... no CIA officer including Directors George Tenet and Porter Goss briefed the president on the specific enhanced interrogation techniques before April 2006. Is that true?

“Michael Hayden: It is not. The president personally approved the waterboarding of Abu Zubaydah [in 2002]. It’s in his book! What happened here is that the White House refused to give them [the Senate Intelligence Committee] White House documents based upon the separation of powers and executive privilege. That’s not in their report, but all of that proves that there was dialogue was going on with the White House. What I can say is that the president never knew where the [black] sites were. That’s the only fact I’m aware that he didn’t know.” http://politi.co/1x0MM8Y

--“List of the 13 techniques used on detainees” – AP: “Here are the methods, as listed by a May 30, 2005, Justice Department memo to the CIA: 1. Abdominal Slap ... 2. Attention Grasp ... 3. Cramped Confinement ... 4. Dietary Manipulation ... 5. The Facial Hold ... 6. The Facial Slap/Insult Slap ... 7. Nudity ... 8. Stress Positions ... 9. Sleep Deprivation ... 10. Wall Standing ... 11. Walling ... 12. Waterboarding ... 13. Water Dousing.” With detailed descriptions of each technique: http://bit.ly/1IyF1KZ

--“Ex-CIA Directors: Interrogations Saved Lives” – WSJ op-ed by former CIA Directors George J. Tenet, Porter J. Goss and Michael V. Hayden and former CIA Deputy Directors John E. McLaughlin, Albert M. Calland and Stephen R. Kappes: “The program was invaluable in three critical ways: It led to the capture of senior al Qaeda operatives, thereby removing them from the battlefield. It led to the disruption of terrorist plots and prevented mass casualty attacks, saving American and Allied lives. It added enormously to what we knew about al Qaeda as an organization and therefore informed our approaches on how best to attack, thwart and degrade it.” http://on.wsj.com/1x0NnYj

JON STEWART: “This report is the ‘Frozen’ of CIA Senate Intelligence Committee redacted torture reports. Let me go, let me go, don't hold me back ... Why do we need to see this stupid old boring CIA torture report anyway? We got to the bottom of this years ago. [Plays a 2007 clip of Pres. Bush saying ‘This government does not torture people.'] Boom! Pow! If that famed painter of cats and feet says we didn't torture, who are we to disagree? My guess is that the Senate report is just a single piece of paper, saying ‘This government does not torture people.’” VIDEO: http://bit.ly/1BybPBQ

TORTURE TAKEAWAYS:

--ANDREW SULLIVAN: “The great achievement of this report ... is its meticulousness. No one can now claim that these torture sessions gave us anything of any worth, while damning this country for decades to come as the worst human rights abuser in the West.” http://bit.ly/1ukz8av

--JEFFREY GOLDBERG: “The next time a group of Islamist terrorists succeeds in killing large numbers of Americans—and such an attack should be expected—it is important for those who are in positions of power (very much including the writers and commentators who shape popular thinking) to keep in mind that the goal of the United States is to neutralize the threat, and not to seek retribution for the sake of retribution.” http://theatln.tc/1By74Ix

-- R. Jeffrey Smith ?( @rjsmithcpi): “Bush himself expressed discomfort when shown pic of detainee in diaper chained to ceiling & forced to defecate on self, sez Intell Rpt.”

--JOHN McCAIN on the Senate floor: “[T]he American people ... must know when the values that define our nation are intentionally disregarded by our security policies ... They must be able to make informed judgments about whether those policies and the personnel who supported them were justified in compromising our values; whether they served a greater good; or whether, as I believe, they stained our national honor, did much harm and little practical good.” http://1.usa.gov/1z5Bwq3

--DAVID IGNATIUS: “This is a political document, not a dispassionate history, but that’s part of its value: There simply is no way for a democracy to get past a trauma like the interrogation issue without an honest public accounting. It’s a strange healing process, ripping off the scab, exposing our wounds; perhaps it’s like the self-flagellation of the early saints.” http://wapo.st/1Aep32A

DRILLING DOWN:

--“Does Torture Work? The C.I.A.’s Claims and What the Committee Found,” by NYT’s Matt Apuzzo, Haeyoun Park and Larry Buchanan: “Here are eight cases cited in the report where the C.I.A. made the case that its tactics thwarted plots and led to the capture of terrorists, and how the committee's report undercut those accounts ... Killing of Osama bin Laden ... Thwarting of Dirty Bomb and Capture of José Padilla ... Thwarting of the Karachi Plots ... Thwarting of ‘Second Wave’ Plot and Discovery of Al Ghurabaa Group ... Identification, Capture and Arrest of Iyman Faris ... Thwarting of the Heathrow Airport and Canary Wharf Plot ... Capture of Ramzi bin al-Shibh ...

--“Biden: Release of torture report is 'badge of honor',” by Lucy McCalmont: “Vice President Joe Biden on Tuesday called the bombshell report on CIA interrogation tactics a ‘badge of honor’ and said its public release would strengthen the United States ... when [he was] asked at POLITICO’s Women Rule Summit whether the sharply critical report by the Senate Intelligence Committee is a ‘black stain.’ ‘Every country, every country, has engaged in activities somewhere along the line that it has not been proud of,’ he added.” http://politi.co/1By6PgA

HARRY REID INTERVIEW -- “Reid’s new mission: Blocking ‘crazy stuff,’ by Manu Raju: “[A] defiant Reid showed his cards on the incredible losses his party suffered — he blames the rollout of the health care law — on his future — he’s hiring staff for his next campaign already — on how he plans to operate in the new world order — ready to take on Republicans when necessary but accepts that the White House may work with his rival Mitch McConnell, whether he likes it or not. ...

“While he said he is ‘not going to stand in the way’ of one key aspect of the White House agenda that he strongly opposes — the administration’s international trade deals — he also blasted another Republican effort that could garner bipartisan support: corporate tax reform, saying ‘that damn sure isn’t mainstream’ and is a ‘code message for ‘let’s take care of business.”’ ... [A] feisty Reid was noncommittal about running for Democratic leader again and insisted there is nothing he could have done differently to make the Senate work more efficiently over the past two years.” http://politi.co/1yzEgsV
