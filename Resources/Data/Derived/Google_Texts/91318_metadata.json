The center\u2019s 2009 study found that 80 percent of the nuns in the country were over 60.\n\n\u201cTheir model of caring for their older sisters is no longer sustainable,\u201d said Robin Eggert, president of the Realm consulting group, which has worked with several nuns\u2019 orders to find solutions.\n\nEggert said a number of women\u2019s religious orders have partnered with outside organizations offering skilled nursing, assisted living and other levels of care, but \u201cWe\u2019ve never done Jewish before.\u201d\n\nThe Sisters of Charity of New York has seen its numbers decline from a 1960s peak of 1,350 to 270 today, and no new sisters had joined in the U.S. in 20 years. It was the first order to put out a request for proposals that was answered by the nonprofit Jewish Home Lifecare. Two other orders based in Manhattan, the Franciscan Handmaids of the Most Pure Heart of Mary and the Missionary Sisters of the Immaculate Heart of Mary, followed.\n\nSeveral of the nuns now living at Jewish Home, including retired teachers, social workers and nurses, said they were very happy after some original hesitation.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Aging Catholic nuns get care at Jewish nursing home", "title": "Aging Catholic nuns get care at Jewish nursing home", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Aging Catholic nuns get care at Jewish nursing home", "title": "Aging Catholic nuns get care at Jewish nursing home", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/05/24/aging_catholic_nuns_get_care_at_jewish_nursing_home/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/aging-nuns-eldercare.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Aging Catholic nuns get care at Jewish nursing home", "title": "Aging Catholic nuns get care at Jewish nursing home", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/aging-nuns-eldercare.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Jim Fitzgerald", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd09b8\"", "article_summary": "Several of the nuns now living at Jewish Home, including retired teachers, social workers and nurses, said they were very happy after some original hesitation.\n\u201cTheir model of caring for their older sisters is no longer sustainable,\u201d said Robin Eggert, president of the Realm consulting group, which has worked with several nuns\u2019 orders to find solutions.\nIt was the first order to put out a request for proposals that was answered by the nonprofit Jewish Home Lifecare.\nTwo other orders based in Manhattan, the Franciscan Handmaids of the Most Pure Heart of Mary and the Missionary Sisters of the Immaculate Heart of Mary, followed.\nThe center\u2019s 2009 study found that 80 percent of the nuns in the country were over 60."}
