Is it jobs and the economy? Immigration and the border crisis? Obamacare? Women\u2019s health issues? The Veterans Affairs scandal? The minimum wage? A world in turmoil? The image of House Republicans? Anger toward Washington? Power?\n\nThe signals are mixed. The playing field tilts toward the GOP, but will the normal patterns of midterm elections allow Republicans to achieve their overriding goal of taking control of the Senate? Is there something driving the year? Politicians aren\u2019t sure.\n\n\u201cIt feels a little like \u201910,\u201d said Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam (R), who is coasting toward reelection. \u201cNot as strong. . . . I get a huge sense of frustration about Washington. But to be honest, it doesn\u2019t feel quite as red hot as it did in \u201910. In \u201910, the anger and frustration was palpable.\u201d\n\nAttention skips from one crisis to the next and politicians scramble to keep up. For virtually all of Obama\u2019s presidency, jobs and the economy topped the list of voters\u2019 concerns. Last week, Gallup reported that there has been a surge in concern about immigration \u2014 a tripling in the percentage of people who cite it as the most important issue facing the country, at 17 percent. A month ago, just 5 percent of Americans pointed to that issue as their top concern.\n\nNext in line, at 16 percent, is dissatisfaction with governors, with Congress, with politicians, with poor leadership \u2014 a general grab bag holding all the complaints voiced for years about the way people think they are being governed. The economy was next, at 15 percent, and unemployment and jobs fourth, at 14 percent.\n\nView Graphic Election Lab: See our current forecast for every congressional race in 2014\n\nMore Americans still name some aspect of the economy as the biggest issue in Gallup\u2019s findings \u2014 41 percent in the latest survey. But the fever is not as high as it has been. In February, 53 percent of Americans named at least one economic issue as the country\u2019s biggest problem. In late 2011, it was 76 percent. In fact, mentions of the economy are at their lowest since January 2008.\n\nThe newfound concern about immigration puts politicians in both parties on edge, in part because polling doesn\u2019t point toward any agreement on what to do. A recent Pew Research Center survey on immigration only adds to the confusion about what the real fears are about \u2014 and what politicians should do in response.\n\nMore people today say the passage of \u201csignificant new immigration legislation\u201d is either important or extremely important, rising from 49 percent in February to 61 percent. Democrats haven\u2019t changed their view on the matter in that time, but Republicans and independents have \u2014 significantly.\n\nDoes that mean there is more support for the kind of comprehensive immigration legislation that the Senate approved a year ago and that has been parked in the House ever since, legislation that called for a path to citizenship for those already here illegally? Hardly.\n\nRepublicans are less supportive of changing the law to allow those here illegally to gain some legal status than they were five months ago. Since February, support for legal status among Republicans has dropped 10 points, to 54 percent \u2014 still a majority but down noticeably. Among Republicans who back the tea party movement, support has dropped 15 points since February, to 41 percent.\n\nAt the National Governors Association meeting in Nashville this month, I asked state leaders to describe how they view this election year. In 2010, the answers would have been clear and consistent: concern about the economy and rising opposition to Obama\u2019s leadership on health care and other issues. This time, nothing quite added up, other than a sense of frustration with leadership in Washington.\n\nIowa Gov. Terry Branstad (R), who is seeking another term, said this election will be mostly about the president\u2019s performance.\n\n\u201cIt is a midterm election in the second term of an unpopular president,\u201d he said. \u201cI think a lot of people are very frustrated and disappointed with this administration and with the lack of direction in foreign policy and the disaster of Obamacare. Consequently, I think it will be a bad election for the president\u2019s party and a good election for the other party.\u201d\n\nDelaware Gov. Jack Markell (D), who is not facing an election in November, said the campaign is about economic opportunity and economic mobility \u2014 or at least it should be. \u201cWhether that\u2019s how voters are hearing it at the moment, I can\u2019t say,\u201d he said. \u201cBut any candidate who isn\u2019t running on it isn\u2019t thinking correctly.\u201d\n\nMarkell said the steady, if unspectacular, growth in jobs and the lowering in the unemployment rate should accrue to the Democrats\u2019 favor. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to start with the results,\u201d he said. \u201cAre things getting better that way? I think the answer to that is clearly yes.\u201d\n\nWisconsin Gov. Scott Walker (R), who is in a tough reelection campaign, took it a step further. It\u2019s \u201cnot just jobs and the economy,\u201d he said. \u201cMost voters who are persuadable and are still undecided are more often than not cynical. They don\u2019t think politicians can actually get things done. And so they\u2019re trying to figure out not just who is actually telling me something I believe in and like, but that I actually believe can get done.\u201d\n\nColorado Gov. John Hickenlooper (D), who could have a serious challenge in the fall, sees an election year that he hopes could be a pivot point during an era of polarization and partisan conflict. \u201cI\u2019m hoping that this year is kind of the culmination and that after this year some of these things are going to begin to resolve themselves in a more constructive way,\u201d he said.\n\nThe absence of an overriding issue of the kind that drove the elections of 2010 and 2006 (then, it was the war in Iraq and dissatisfaction with President George W. Bush) has left each party with the same strategy.\n\nSome party strategists have resigned themselves to the idea that there are so few truly persuadable voters this year that all their money and focus should go into techniques to energize their loyalists and to forget about the rest.\n\nThey are talking almost exclusively to their most ardent supporters, warning that the sky could fall if they don\u2019t vote, in hopes of ratcheting up turnout just enough to win. Which is why Republicans are running ads about the Affordable Care Act and the Democrats are targeting unmarried women.\n\nAre voters buying it? The Center for the Study of the American Electorate reported Monday that participation in the primaries this year points to what could be the lowest midterm primary turnout in history \u2014 with an 18 percent fall-off from 2010 so far. In 15 of 25 states covered in the report, turnout in the primary was at a historic low.\n\nGiven public cynicism about politicians and Washington, that\u2019s hardly a surprise. Gallup\u2019s analysis of public perceptions of Congress, which are still near historic lows, summed up the political year this way: \u201cThe mixture of disapproval and disappointment that so many Americans feel toward Congress could produce unpredictable results this fall.\u201d\n\nThat may be the closest anyone comes to explaining where things stand four months before the election.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Public cynicism about politicians and Washington and low primary turnouts point to unpredictable election year.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/danbalzwapo", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Public cynicism about politicians and Washington and low primary turnouts point to unpredictable election year.", "title": "What 2014 is all about.
