“Bird in the hand. … Al­though he might want to re­fo­cus on oph­thal­mo­logy.”

“He had early mo­mentum that has been lost, and it’s hard to see how he gets it back. He’d be much bet­ter served drop­ping out and hold­ing on to his seat.”

“But we hope he doesn’t.”

“If Dems have a good can­did­ate, [Paul’s] seat is win­nable for them.”

“He bet­ter, be­cause he is go­ing nowhere in the pres­id­en­tial race, and he could in­duce a real op­pon­ent to jump in.”

“Based on his cam­paign live-streams, Rand not only needs to lower his sights; he also needs a hug.”

No

“Would be awe­some if he lost both elec­tions.”

“Only be­cause I think Dems could win that seat if he con­tin­ues to ig­nore it.”

“Not yet, still could catch light­ning.”

“In that field, any­thing still seems pos­sible—but he should re­fo­cus on me­dia train­ing to make him­self less stiff and more likable.”

“Def­in­itely. His time has not come and nev­er will if he does not re­tain his Sen­ate seat.”

“No one is buy­ing what he’s selling.”

“He shouldn’t have reelec­tion prob­lems if he exits the pres­id­en­tial race with dig­nity.”

“The Sen­ate needs small-gov­ern­ment con­ser­vat­ives who will stand up to the party elites.”

“No chance for pres­id­en­tial nom­in­a­tion.”

“If he doesn’t, then his leg­acy will be the man who gave the keys to the Sen­ate over to Chuck Schu­mer.”

“He’s only hold­ing 20 per­cent of his fath­er’s sup­port­ers, if that. The pres­id­en­tial thing didn’t work out and he’s not even con­trib­ut­ing a dif­fer­ent per­spect­ive on the race. No point in go­ing for­ward.”

“Un­less he has the Ru­bio dis­ease and just hates the Sen­ate, he needs to face facts. He is young enough that he can try this again an­oth­er time. Out of of­fice he will simply fade out of sight.”

“Or maybe V.P.”

“The Sen­ate is a fine place and worth fight­ing for.”

No

“Rand Paul doesn’t de­serve to be [in] the Sen­ate any more than he does the White House. I’d rather it go to a Demo­crat than have him in of­fice.”

“Re­pub­lic­ans will be bet­ter off if he loses that, too.”

“He still has some de­bates re­main­ing—al­though his per­form­ance has been un­in­spir­ing.”
