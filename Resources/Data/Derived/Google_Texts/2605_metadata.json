Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) to comment on Obamacare architect Jonathan Gruber\u2019s remarks about the \u201cstupid\u201d American people that have been captured in two separate videos from last year.\n\nAccording to video that surfaced last week, Gruber said in October 2013 that Obama was able to ram the Affordable Care Act into law because of its \u201clack of transparency\u201d and the \u201cstupidity of the American voter.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t get past the irony to even get to the arrogance,\u201d Gowdy said of Gruber\u2019s past comments. \u201cThe most transparent administration since the continent shifted had to rely on artifice and deception to pass its signature piece of legislation. You can\u2019t make that up.\u201d\n\nMegyn Kelly called the videos \u2014 one of which was newly discovered yesterday \u2014 the \u201csmoking gun piece of evidence\u201d showing that individuals behind Obamacare\u2019s construction used dishonesty to craft the law.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really serious in a participatory democracy when you tell your fellow citizens that you are either not smart enough to understand the truth or we can\u2019t tell you the truth because you wouldn\u2019t go along with it,\u201d explained Gowdy. \u201cWell if you wouldn\u2019t go along with it, maybe you shouldn\u2019t pass the law.\u201d\n\nThe South Carolina Republican then issued some solid advice for Gruber, who is a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n\n\u201cPut down the cognac and the lost writings of J.D. Salinger,\u201d said Gowdy. \u201cIf you want to see how stupid our fellow citizens are, take a look at last Tuesday night because they rejected you, this bill and this administration.\u201d\n\nGowdy also called on Obama to \u201crepudiate\u201d Gruber for insulting the American people by calling them stupid.\n\n\u201cI would love for the president \u2026 to repudiate what this guy [said],\u201d explained Gowdy. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s an insult. He insulted the very people, frankly, who put the president in office twice. So I would love to hear somebody other than Josh Earnest apologize for what this professor said.\u201d\n\nWatch the latest video at video.foxnews.com", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "Fox News' Megyn Kelly invited Rep.
