Then, about 70 percent of them spoke another language at home. The rate is now 85 percent.\n\nThe new numbers come from the 2012 American Community Survey, which asks respondents whether they speak only English at home, or speak another language. If they spoke another language at home they are asked whether they speak English \u201cvery well,\u201d \u201cwell,\u201d \u201cnot well,\u201d or \u201cnot at all.\u201d\n\nThe census says there are 40.6 million immigrants aged five and older in the U.S.\n\nMexicans, who are the most numerous and account for more than a quarter of those immigrants, rank particularly low \u2014 29 percent say they don\u2019t speak English well, and another 18 percent say they don\u2019t speak it at all.\n\nGuatemalans, who number about 852,000, rank lowest, with 31 percent saying they don\u2019t speak English well and 18 percent saying they don\u2019t speak it at all.\n\nUnsurprisingly, education is a major predictor of English skills. About three-quarters of all immigrants who have a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher speak English very well. Just 19 percent of those with less than high school education do so.\n\nThe report is available here: http://www.census.gov/prod/2014pubs/acs-26.pdf", "article_metadata": {"description": "Less than half of immigrants speak English very well and about 13 percent don't speak it at all, according to new numbers the U.S. Census Bureau released Tuesday.", "Author": "Stephen Dinan", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Less than half of immigrants speak English very well and about 13 percent don\u2019t speak it at all, according to new numbers the U.S. Census Bureau released Tuesday.", "title": "Less than half of immigrants speak English well: Census Bureau", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jun/10/less-half-immigrants-speak-english-well/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/06/10/ap090318041747.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/06/10/ap090318041747.jpg", "title": "Less than half of immigrants speak English well: Census Bureau", "description": "Less than half of immigrants speak English very well and about 13 percent don't speak it at all, according to new numbers the U.S. Census Bureau released Tuesday.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Social Issues"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1338\"", "article_summary": "Less than half of immigrants speak English very well and about 13 percent don\u2019t speak it at all, according to new numbers the U.S. Census Bureau released Tuesday.\nGuatemalans, who number about 852,000, rank lowest, with 31 percent saying they don\u2019t speak English well and 18 percent saying they don\u2019t speak it at all.\nAbout three-quarters of all immigrants who have a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher speak English very well.\nImmigrants who have been here for more than three decades, however, do better \u2014 63 percent report having English-speaking abilities and just 6 percent don\u2019t speak English at all.\nSPECIAL COVERAGE: Immigration ReformThe report also found that immigrants are less likely to speak English at home now than they were in 1980."}
