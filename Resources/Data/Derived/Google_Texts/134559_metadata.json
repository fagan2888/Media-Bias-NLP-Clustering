ObamaCare has busted them, regulations are killing them, the world market is not stable. We now seem to be more interested in stabilizing Iran than we are America. Americans have lost jobs, 5 million foreclosures, 5 million manufacturing jobs lost since the year 2000, and this president seems to think that if we just put some more regulations, raise taxes, and make it harder for businesses to succeed, that maybe the economy will get better. Well, Stuart, the economy is not in recovery for many Americans who are out there working every day.\n\nThat\u2019s just ridiculous. First of all, George W. Bush was president most of the time since 2000. Second, even Fox Business has reported that the sell off was due to the weakening economy in China, which devalued its yuan currency two weeks ago, not because of President Obama.\n\n\n\nWatch it below, from the August 24 Your World.", "article_metadata": {"csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "google-site-verification": "google51c0b549f514d464.html", "csrf-token": "X+Xo+ZSi1kam6zSzF9NePmWfWrb/gfvNaW5RzgsdQ+U=", "og": {"url": "http://www.newshounds.us/fox_news_blames_obama_for_the_stock_market_crash_082415", "site_name": "NewsHounds", "image": "http://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/newshounds/sites/1/meta_images/original/Newshound3_blue.png?1327001871", "type": "article", "title": "Fox News Blames Obama For The Stock Market Crash"}, "Title": "Fox News Blames Obama For The Stock Market Crash"}, "article_summary": "41 minutes after the tumultuous stock market closed today, Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee went on Fox\u2019s Your World show and blamed President Obama for the crash.\nObamaCare has busted them, regulations are killing them, the world market is not stable.\nSecond, even Fox Business has reported that the sell off was due to the weakening economy in China, which devalued its yuan currency two weeks ago, not because of President Obama.\nWell, Stuart, the economy is not in recovery for many Americans who are out there working every day.\nHuckabee took the bait \u2013 with a few gratuitous swipes at ObamaCare and the nuclear Iran deal while he was at it."}
