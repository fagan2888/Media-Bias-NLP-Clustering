Nuner School from 6 to 11 p.m. Saturday at the Potawatomi Park Conservatory, Mishawaka Avenue.\n\nThe organizers are Teresa McChesney Cook, Janet Yeager Maciulski, Paula Yeager Canarecci, Sue Yeager Hubler, Jan Scott Rhodes, Linda Sterchi-Grimes and Linda Wilson Pierson.\n\nAbout 75 people attended the reunion last year. They raised about $1,000 for the Botanical Society.\n\n\"You never forget the kids you grew up with,\" Teresa said. And the River Park neighborhood was one big happy family. That's why the reunion was so popular.\n\nHow do you follow a successful evening? Why not another reunion? It is $15 per person, $25 for a couple. Food and beverages will be available for a small charge. Throw in raffles, music from Bryan Barr and photo displays.\n\nThe funds raised will be used to develop a sensory garden in the park. Janet Maciulski is a member of the reunion committee and secretary for the Botanical Society. Janet came up with the idea for the garden, which will be named for D.J. Milliken, a special needs adult who lived in River Park. D.J. died in February.\n\nJanet said D.J.'s father, Kenneth \"Doc\" Milliken is a South Bend police officer and he has patrolled River Park for years. Everyone knows Doc.\n\nRSVP by Wednesday by calling 574-235-9442, or join the Nuner Knights Reunite Facebook page.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nTwo local students were recently selected to the National Society of High School Scholars.
