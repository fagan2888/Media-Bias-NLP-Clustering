More than a decade after his death, Arthur Miller’s plays continue to resonate with readers and audiences across the world. This October marks his 100th birthday, and theaters from Los Angeles to London are staging Miller productions in celebration of his centennial.

This hour, we reflect on Miller's career, which spanned seven decades and yielded such classics as "Death of a Salesman" and "The Crucible." We also learn a bit about his personal life -- including his years as a resident of Roxbury, Connecticut.
