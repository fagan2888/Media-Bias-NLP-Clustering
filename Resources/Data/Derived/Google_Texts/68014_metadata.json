About halfway through the paperback, this method started to speak to me, when she discussed the 19th century social shift from venerating elders to dismissing them as basically useless.\n\nShe cites an expert on this transition, the historian Thomas Cole:\n\n\"The emerging idea that humans were perfectible brought with it a belief that the precariousness of life could be eradicated, and that human limits need no longer apply. Old age became a disease, a pathology demanding professional expertise, if not custodial care. What got lost, Cole suggests, was any framework that made sense \u2014 morally, spiritually or metaphysically \u2014 of growing old.\"\n\nWithout this cultural framework, Karpf suggests, it's up to each of us to build our own. She's not about to supply her readers with a blueprint, but her book is studded with clues like this one:\n\n\"Those who urge us to fight ageing are, in effect, inviting us to stop growing and developing. In so doing, they're depriving us of the opportunity to carry out and successfully complete the task of being alive and human. Individually and collectively we're being infantilized: we should insist on the right to grow up.\"\n\nREFRESHER COURSE\n\nA new survey out from AARP polled 1,200 Americans aged 34 to 75, and found that brain health was very much on the minds of 93 percent of them.\n\nTrouble is, their actual knowledge of how to keep their cognitive functions functioning was clocked at way lower numbers. Here's a rundown of what research has shown to be effective, along with the level of awareness the study found.\n\n-- Learning something new: Some 50 percent believed brain games work \u2014 evidence for this is mixed \u2014 while only 9 percent knew about the proven strategy of taking a class.\n\n-- Managing stress: Only 38 percent knew this one.\n\n-- Eating right: Only 58 percent knew the value of nutrition.\n\n-- Being social: The least well-known factor, at 18 percent.\n\n-- Keeping fit: At this point in the research, it appears that moving your body is the most productive way to maintain your brain; only 44 percent knew this one.\n\nSTAYING POSITIVE\n\nThe International Conference on Positive Aging that caused a stir in Sarasota almost a year ago may have sailed off into the sunset, but its spunky little sister in Charlotte County will be back for an encore.\n\nThis year's Positive Aging Symposium will be held from 8:30 a.m. to 2 p.m. Feb. 13 at the Port Charlotte Beach Complex on Harbor Boulevard.\n\nThe symposium is open to everyone, but aimed at those seeking the keys to a healthy and fulfilling life after 50. This year's topics are \"Get it Together: Legally Speaking,\" \"Keep it Together: Healthy Mind,\" and \"Better Together: Getting Connected.\" The $10 ticket also buys you a boxed lunch.\n\nSponsors are the United Way of Charlotte County, Friendship Centers, AARP, the Area Agency on Aging and Charlotte County government.
