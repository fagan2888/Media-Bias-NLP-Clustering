Every day, we get thousands of letters and emails at the White House from Americans across the country \u2014 and every night, I read ten of them. They tell me about their hopes and their worries, their hardships and successes. They\u2019re the Americans I\u2019m working for every day \u2014 and this year, several of these letter writers will join me at the Capitol when I deliver my annual State of the Union Address on Tuesday night.\n\nCarolyn Reed wrote to me from Colorado to tell me she was able to expand her business, thanks to a loan from the Small Business Administration. Today, she and her husband own seven Silver Mine Sub Shops \u2014 and last year, they raised wages for all their hourly employees.\n\nVictor Fugate, from Butler, Missouri, wrote to tell me that he was unemployed for a while a few years ago, but today he\u2019s earned his degree and found a full-time job. Victor said that he and his wife were able to afford their student loans because our country offered millions of Americans the chance to cap their monthly payments as a percentage of their income \u2014 and, because of the Affordable Care Act, they now have the security and peace of mind of affordable health insurance.\n\nWhile serving in Afghanistan, Jason Gibson was gravely wounded\u2014he lost both his legs. When I first met him in the hospital, he was just beginning his long, difficult road to recovery. But last year, Sergeant Gibson wrote to tell me that with the help of our extraordinary doctors and nurses, he\u2019s making extraordinary progress. He just moved into a new home, and he and his wife just had a baby girl.\n\nStories like these give us reason to start the new year with confidence. 2014 was the fastest year for job growth since the 1990s. Unemployment fell faster than any year since 1984. Our combat mission in Afghanistan has come to a responsible end, and more of our heroes are coming home. America\u2019s resurgence is real.\n\nOur job now is to make sure that every American feels that they\u2019re a part of our country\u2019s comeback. That\u2019s what I\u2019ll focus on in my State of the Union \u2014 how to build on our momentum, with rising wages, growing incomes, and a stronger middle class. And I\u2019ll call on this new Congress to join me in putting aside the political games and finding areas where we agree so we can deliver for the American people.\n\nThe last six years have demanded resilience and sacrifice from all of us. All of us have a right to be proud of the progress America has made. And I hope you\u2019ll tune in on Tuesday to hear about the steps we can take to build on this progress, and to seize this moment together. Thanks everybody, and have a great weekend. ####\n\nPrevious weekly remarks from both parties are available here.\n\nRELATED:\n\nWhat you should know as the 2016 field forms\n\nWhat\u2019s Obama\u2019s problem calling radical Islam radical Islam?\n\nObama vows vigilance on terrorism, frees more Gitmo prisoners\n\n50 leaders march with millions against terrorism; But not Obama", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Obama's weekly remarksHi, everybody.
