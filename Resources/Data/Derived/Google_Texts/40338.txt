I will defend to the death the right of any American Spectator reader to call me (or anyone else in the stable of writers) a nitwit. However, as Churchill said in a delightful essay called “A word to end a sentence with,” there is certain nonsense up with which I will not put.

A reader who goes by the name of “The_Heretic70” had this to say about my weekend article, “The Trumpster as Joker: Can He Go All the Way?”

The Wilson nitwit states what Trump is saying, he will not (do).… I doubt that very much. In fact, I look forward to all of it occurring. The author is an imbecile. He was probably one of those that didn’t believe Obama when he said he was going to fundamentally change this country [emphasis added]. Look at how that turned out for us.

I take a back seat to no one — and certainly not to Donald Trump or any of his supporters — when it comes to early and strongly stated recognition of just how ruinous the “transformation” promised by Obama could be. I wrote this articlein the Wall Street Journal in early September 2008, just a few days after he became nominee for president at the Democratic Party convention in Denver.

Since then, I have written scores of other articles (some screaming with outrage, others of a satiric bent) criticizing Obama and his policies. That includes more than a hundred articles in The American Spectator.

What was Trump doing back at this time. Well, in 2006, he was a big supporter and heavy contributor to Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi. You can credit him with help to create the Democratic Party super-majorities of both houses that went on to pass Obamacare.

Trump contributed to Hillary Clinton in her race against Obama in the Democratic primary. And he wants to run against her in 2016.

After all the wrack and ruin left behind by Obama, it scares the hell out of me to think that it could come down to a choice between the two of them in 2016.
