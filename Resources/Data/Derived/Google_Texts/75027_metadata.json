Among the questions they asked was one relating to abortion.\n\nMRC started off by inquiring about whether she has children. Wasserman Schultz proudly responded, \u201cI do,\u201d and also told of their ages: \u201ctwin 16-year-olds and a 12-year-old,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIn your opinion,\u201d MRC replied, \u201cwere they human beings before they were born?\u201d\n\nQuickly understanding where the line of questioning was going, Wasserman Schultz responded with a talking point.\n\n\u201cYou know,\u201d she said, \u201cI believe that every woman has the right to make their own reproductive choices.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut what did you believe about your children,\u201d MRC pressed.\n\nTo which DWS again replied with a talking point about reproductive choices.\n\nFrustrated by her evasiveness, MRC responded, \u201cSo were they human beings? Just yes or no.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re human beings today,\u201d she emphasized, \u201cand I\u2019m glad I had the opportunity to make my own reproductive choices, as \u2013 a right that every woman has and should maintain.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear from this video whether Wasserman-Schultz actually falls into the category of people who truly believe that life only begins at birth. Rather, it seems she\u2019s just carefully parroting DNC talking points that cover the full spectrum of pro-choice women. If she does, though, science is definitely not on her side.", "article_metadata": {"description": "MRCTV.org got a chance to catch up with Democratic National Committee Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz at the first Democratic debate on Tuesday.
