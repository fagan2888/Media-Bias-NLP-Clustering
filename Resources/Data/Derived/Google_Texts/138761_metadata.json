The flag represents the union of thirteen colonies turned into states.\n\nCongress wrote:\n\n\u201cThat the flag of the thirteen United States be thirteen stripes, alternate red and white.\u201d\n\nThe colors of the the vertical stripes are white signifying purity and innocence, and red, for hardiness and valor. Blue signifies vigilance, perseverance and justice. The blue rectangle is referred to as the \u201cunion\u201d and it bears 50 small, white, five-pointed stars arranged in nine offset horizontal rows of six stars (top and bottom) alternating with rows of five stars.\n\nNicknames for the flag include the Stars and Stripes, Old Glory, and The Star-Spangled Banner.\n\nREAD ALSO: Happy birthday, Stars and Stripes: Why June 14 is Flag Day\n\n\n\nThis year also marks the 200th anniversary year of The Star Spangled Banner, our national anthem written by Francis Scott Key, a 35-year-old lawyer, during the British bombardment of Baltimore, Maryland in September of the year 1814, near the end of the War of 1812.\n\nKey was on a British flagship, the HHS Tonant, talking to Major General Robert Ross and Vice Admiral Alexander Cochrane over dinner, trying to rescue his friend Dr. William Beanes who had been taken as a prisoner of war. They were there to present letters to the British commanders attesting to the fact that Beanes and other Americans had been kind to British soldiers wounded in the battle.\n\nThe British would let Dr. Beanes go, but only after they had \u201cburned Baltimore to the ground.\u201d They had already burned Washington, and Fort Washington had fallen, leading to the plunder of Alexandria, Virginia. The United Kingdom is the only country to have ever burned the White House or Washington, D.C.\n\nOn September 13, 1814 for more than 24-hours, the British Navy attacked Fort McHenry, the guard post to Baltimore\u2019s harbor. In the \u201cdawn\u2019s early light\u201d Key saw that the American flag no longer flew over the fort, but it was shortly replaced by a forty-two foot flag inspiring the now famous poem, Defence of Fort M\u2019Henry, which became America\u2019s anthem.\n\nThat poem was set to the tune of a popular British song written byJohn Stafford Smith for the Anacreontic Society, a practice called \u201ccontrafactum.\u201d In 1898, the Navy adopted \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d for official use. President Woodrow Wilson declared the song our national anthem in 1916, and the declaration was signed into a resolution by President Herbert Hoover in March, 1931.\n\nToday, nearly 200 years after Key penned his poem, America still celebrates that early dawn moment that was immortalized in what is now our National Anthem.\n\nLyrics and full versed song\n\nO say can you see by the dawn\u2019s early light,\n\nWhat so proudly we hailed at the twilight\u2019s last gleaming,\n\nWhose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight,\n\nO\u2019er the ramparts we watched, were so gallantly streaming?\n\nAnd the rockets\u2019 red glare, the bombs bursting in air,\n\nGave proof through the night that our flag was still there;\n\nO say does that star-spangled banner yet wave,\n\nO\u2019er the land of the free and the home of the brave?\n\nOn the shore dimly seen through the mists of the deep,\n\nWhere the foe\u2019s haughty host in dread silence reposes,\n\nWhat is that which the breeze, o\u2019er the towering steep,\n\nAs it fitfully blows, half conceals, half discloses?\n\nNow it catches the gleam of the morning\u2019s first beam,\n\nIn full glory reflected now shines in the stream:\n\n\u2018Tis the star-spangled banner, O! long may it wave\n\nO\u2019er the land of the free and the home of the brave.\n\nAnd where is that band who so vauntingly swore\n\nThat the havoc of war and the battle\u2019s confusion,\n\nA home and a country, should leave us no more?\n\nTheir blood has washed out their foul footsteps\u2019 pollution.\n\nNo refuge could save the hireling and slave\n\nFrom the terror of flight, or the gloom of the grave:\n\nAnd the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave,\n\nO\u2019er the land of the free and the home of the brave.\n\nO thus be it ever, when freemen shall stand\n\nBetween their loved home and the war\u2019s desolation.\n\nBlest with vict\u2019ry and peace, may the Heav\u2019n rescued land\n\nPraise the Power that hath made and preserved us a nation!\n\nThen conquer we must, when our cause it is just,\n\nAnd this be our motto: \u201cIn God is our trust.\u201d\n\nAnd the star-spangled banner in triumph shall wave\n\nO\u2019er the land of the free and the home of the brave!", "article_metadata": {"description": "Today, nearly 200 years after Key penned his poem America still celebrates that early dawn moment that was immortalized in what is now our National Anthem.", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "author": "Jacquie Kubin", "og": {"site_name": "Communities Digital News", "description": "Today, nearly 200 years after Key penned his poem America still celebrates that early dawn moment that was immortalized in what is now our National Anthem.", "title": "How America\u2019s flag inspired the Star Spangled Banner (Whitney Houston video)", "url": "http://www.commdiginews.com/history-and-holidays/how-americas-flag-inspired-the-star-spangled-banner-whitney-houston-video-2-19522/", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://www.commdiginews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/flag1.jpg", "height": 375}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Today, nearly 200 years after Key penned his poem America still celebrates that early dawn moment that was immortalized in what is now our National Anthem.", "title": "How America\u2019s flag inspired the Star Spangled Banner (Whitney Houston video)", "image": "http://www.commdiginews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/flag1-435x375.jpg", "creator": "@commdiginews", "site": "@commdiginews", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "history,patriotism,american flag", "propeller": "a20eada6e38f74d5c5bf31354ee9760c", "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-14T19:20:38+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-14T20:19:25+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "American Flag, history, patriotism"}, "article_summary": "Now it catches the gleam of the morning\u2019s first beam,In full glory reflected now shines in the stream:\u2018Tis the star-spangled banner, O!\nNicknames for the flag include the Stars and Stripes, Old Glory, and The Star-Spangled Banner.\nlong may it waveO\u2019er the land of the free and the home of the brave.\nBlest with vict\u2019ry and peace, may the Heav\u2019n rescued landPraise the Power that hath made and preserved us a nation!\nWASHINGTON, June 14, 2014 \u2014 June 14, 1777 is the day when the Continental Congress first issued the U.S."}
