It increases to $324 per adult and $162.50 per child this year.\n\nThe fee will increase again in 2016 to $695 per person and $347.50 per child, and will be adjusted for inflation in years afterward.\n\nIndividuals can also sign up for health insurance throughout the year under special circumstances, such as having a baby, getting a divorce, or a changing/losing jobs.\n\nKeep in mind that not all uninsured people will have to pay a penalty.\n\nFor instance, the nearly 17 percent of Floridians who fall in the coverage gap, because they earn too much to qualify for Medicaid and too little to qualify for the marketplace subsidies, won't be penalized.\n\nMedicaid currently applies to individuals whose income is at or below 50 percent of poverty line, and marketplace subsidies begin for individuals at 100 percent to 400 percent of poverty line.\n\nThis means that anyone who earns more than 50 percent of poverty and less than 100 percent of that line remains uninsured in Florida.\n\nCentral Floridians made up 16 percent of the state's marketplace enrollees in the last open enrollment period, with more than 257,000 people, according to Enroll America.\n\nTo find out if you qualify for the extended deadlines, you can visit healthcare.gov or schedule an appointment with a local navigator by calling 877-564-5031 or visiting coveringcfl.net.\n\nnmiller@tribune.com or 407-420-5158.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "There is still time to avoid Obamacare penalties next year", "date": "2015-04-15", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Orlando Sentinel", "author": "Orlando Sentinel", "og": {"site_name": "OrlandoSentinel.com", "description": "If you didn't sign up for health insurance in the federal marketplace in 2014 and were surprised by the penalty when you filed your taxes, you may still be able to sign up for coverage and avoid a penalty next year.", "title": "There is still time to avoid Obamacare penalties next year", "url": "http://www.orlandosentinel.com/health/os-obamacare-signup-taxes-20150415-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-552ecd81/turbine/os-obamacare-signup-taxes-20150415", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp14.17", "twitter": {"site": "@orlandosentinel", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index,follow", "keywords": "obamacare, aca, affordable care act, central florida, taxes, penalty, insurance marketplace", "fb": {"admins": 100004353067097, "page_id": 5779052556, "app_id": 890804050949750}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=402223551, app-argument=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/deeplinkid/83306727", "googlebot-news": "index", "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "news_keywords": "obamacare, aca, affordable care act, central florida, taxes, penalty, insurance marketplace", "y_key": "fb73650ad672fe45", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "Description": "The federal government has extended the health insurance sign-up period to April 30 for people who qualified for but didn't know about the requirement and the associated penalty."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe039f\"", "article_summary": "The federal government has extended the health insurance sign-up period to April 30 for people who qualified for health insurance but didn't know about the requirement and the associated penalty.\nIndividuals can also sign up for health insurance throughout the year under special circumstances, such as having a baby, getting a divorce, or a changing/losing jobs.\nIf you didn't sign up for health insurance in the federal marketplace in 2014 and were surprised by the penalty when you filed your taxes, you may still be able to sign up for coverage and avoid a penalty next year.\nThis means that anyone who earns more than 50 percent of poverty and less than 100 percent of that line remains uninsured in Florida.\nThe penalty was $95 per adult and $47.50 per child in 2014."}
