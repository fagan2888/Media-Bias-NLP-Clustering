In fact, prison records obtained by The Denver Post show al-Turki\u2019s only complaints in years behind bars concerned prison staff, not fellow inmates.\n\nAl-Turki has been investigated in connection with the March murder of Colorado prisons chief Tom Clements, particularly whether al-Turki had any ties to a white supremacist prison gang that investigators believe may have ordered the hit. Since then, al-Turki has been moved several times from general population to protective segregation.\n\nAl-Turki has denied having any involvement with Clements\u2019 killing.\n\nAl-Turki had been held at the Limon Correctional Facility until 3:30 a.m. Friday, when Colorado correctional officials moved him to a federal prison in Englewood, Solano said.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know where he will be transferred,\u201d Solano said.\n\nSolano said when he met with al-Turki on Thursday, his client had no indication about any threats against him. Al-Turki\u2019s attorneys received a call from a case worker at Federal Correctional Institution Englewood Friday morning indicating he had been transferred to a federal prison.\n\n\u201cThe decision was made very quickly,\u201d Solano said. \u201cHe was only allowed to take his legal papers and his Koran with him.\u201d\n\nDOC spokeswoman Alison Morgan confirmed that al-Turki was moved to a federal prison for safety reasons under the interstate prison compact but called the move \u201croutine.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe make these decisions based on the business needs of the department and the safe operations of our institutions,\u201d Morgan said.\n\nSolano said he would be concerned if al-Turki, who is scheduled for a hearing this month, was moved far away because it might restrict his ability to meet with his client.\n\nSolano said authorities have indicated al-Turki remains a part of the investigation into the killing of Clements, who was shot to death on the doorstep of his Monument home on March 19. He said in court proceedings the state has denied records requests by al-Turki on the basis that the investigation in the Clements\u2019 case continues.\n\nOne week before he was killed, Clements denied a request by al-Turki to be transferred to Saudi Arabia to serve the remainder of his prison sentence.\n\nEvan Ebel, a member of the white supremacist gang the 211 Crew, allegedly shot Clements. Authorities have investigated whether there are ties \u2014 financial or otherwise \u2014 between al-Turki and the gang. Ebel died in a shootout with Texas authorities March 21.\n\nProsecutors have said al-Turki kept his Indonesian housekeeper a virtual slave and sexually assaulted her over four years. Al-Turki, a well-known member of Denver\u2019s Muslim community, has maintained his innocence and claimed the charges were a result of anti-Muslim sentiment following the 9/11 attacks.\n\nHe was convicted in state court in 2006 of unlawful sexual contact by use of force, theft and extortion\u2014all felonies\u2014as well as misdemeanor counts of false imprisonment and conspiracy to commit false imprisonment. He was sentenced to 28 years to life in prison, which was reduced to eight years to life in 2011 on a legal technicality.\n\nKirk Mitchell: 303-954-1206, kmitchell@denverpost.com or twitter.com/kmitchelldp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Saudi prisoner Homaidan al-Turki moved into federal custody for safety", "title": "Saudi prisoner Homaidan al-Turki moved into federal custody for safety", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/09/06/saudi-prisoner-homaidan-al-turki-moved-into-federal-custody-for-safety/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130523__BN20130523_Z00_BNCD23ALTURKIPRISONp1.jpg", "height": 492}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130523__BN20130523_Z00_BNCD23ALTURKIPRISONp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2013-09-06T12:01:29+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-29T12:34:06+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdab34\"", "article_summary": "Al-Turki\u2019s attorneys received a call from a case worker at Federal Correctional Institution Englewood Friday morning indicating he had been transferred to a federal prison.\nColorado authorities have moved Homaidan al-Turki , the Saudi man convicted of sexually assaulting his housekeeper for years, from a state prison to a federal lockup for security reasons, his attorney said Friday.\nAl-Turki had been held at the Limon Correctional Facility until 3:30 a.m. Friday, when Colorado correctional officials moved him to a federal prison in Englewood, Solano said.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know where he will be transferred,\u201d Solano said.\nIn fact, prison records obtained by The Denver Post show al-Turki\u2019s only complaints in years behind bars concerned prison staff, not fellow inmates."}
