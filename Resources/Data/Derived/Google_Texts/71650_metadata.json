It\u2019s called the Estate Recovery Program, and under Obamacare, it just got bigger and its reach broader.\n\nHow broad? Well, your family might face a posthumous bill even if you didn\u2019t seek medical care while you were a Medi-Cal enrollee.\n\n\u201cYou might never go to the doctor, (but) it doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d said Patricia McGinnis, executive director of California Advocates for Nursing Home Reform. \u201cThe state will still try to collect\u201d the premiums it paid to your health plan ...\n\nQ: I signed up for insurance under Obamacare and was placed into Medi-Cal based on my income. I didn\u2019t find out about estate recovery until later. This is discriminatory! Why are they singling out low-income seniors?\n\nA: Let\u2019s start with a quick primer. The federal government requires states to recoup certain medical costs \u2014 mostly related to nursing home care \u2014 from the estates of some Medicaid beneficiaries after they die.\n\nBut California is among 10 states that seeks repayment beyond the federal minimum, said Anthony Wright, executive director of Health Access California. Here, your estate will be expected to pay back the value of ALL coverage you receive after you turn 55.\n\nThe state may ask your heirs to sign a \u201cvoluntary lien\u201d on your home if there are not sufficient assets in your estate, McGinnis said.\n\nThere are limitations. The state Department of Health Care Services (DHCS), which administers Medi-Cal, cannot require reimbursement under these conditions: until your spouse dies; if you\u2019re survived by a child under 21 or a child of any age who is blind or has a disability; or for services provided before your 55th birthday, unless you\u2019re institutionalized (and a hospital is not considered an institution).\n\nBecause most estates have limited or non-recoverable assets, DHCS said, it recovers funds from only about 5 percent of applicable enrollees. The average amount collected in fiscal year 2013-2014 was $15,600.\n\nBut the Affordable Care Act has raised the stakes significantly. Since Jan. 1, 2014, when Medi-Cal expanded under the new law, more than 3.5 million Californians have joined, bringing total enrollment to a whopping 12.1 million people.\n\nOf newly eligible enrollees (age 19-64), about one in four is 55 or older, DHCS said. About 2 million of all Medi-Cal enrollees are in that age range. Plus, because of recent shifts in how Medi-Cal delivers care, about 80 percent of Medi-Cal recipients are now enrolled in managed care. Unlike Medi-Cal\u2019s traditional fee-for-service model that pays separately for each medical procedure or visit, the state pays managed care health plans a monthly fee to cover each enrollee\u2019s entire medical needs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you\u2019re in Medi-Cal managed care and are subject to estate recovery, your post-death bill will automatically be based on the monthly payments made to your plan \u2014 whether you use any medical services or not.\n\n\u201cMore people are going to see much bigger claims,\u201d McGinnis warned.\n\nTake Anne-Louise Vernon, 60, who asked today\u2019s question. After she learned about estate recovery, she discovered the state is paying the Santa Clara Family Health Plan about $600 per month for her care, no matter how much or little she actually receives.\n\nThat adds up quickly. Vernon\u2019s total bill for Medi-Cal enrollment from April 2014 through March of this year equals about $7,000. \u201cThey single out the lowest-income seniors and force them into involuntary debt,\u201d she said.\n\nState Sen. Ed Hernandez, D-West Covina, agrees older Medi-Cal recipients are being unfairly targeted and points to Covered California\u2019s subsidies as an example.\n\nThe income dividing line between Medi-Cal and Covered California is 138 percent of the federal poverty level. If you fall below it, you\u2019re in Medi-Cal. If you\u2019re above it \u2014 up to 400 percent of the federal poverty level \u2014 you qualify for tax credits from Covered California to offset the cost of your monthly premium.\n\nBut \u201cyou\u2019re not required to pay that (Covered California) subsidy back when you die,\u201d Hernandez says. \u201cSame for every other social program, from food stamps to WIC. You don\u2019t have to pay those back.\u201d\n\nHernandez\u2019s bill, SB 33, would limit California\u2019s estate recovery to the federal minimum and shield homes of \u201cmodest value\u201d from recovery, among other things.\n\nGov. Jerry Brown vetoed a similar measure last year, but Hernandez believes it has more traction now and may be resolved as part of the budget wrangling in the coming weeks.\n\nUntil and unless the law changes, here are some steps you can take to educate and protect yourselves:\n\n\u2022 First, go to the CANHR website \u2014 www.canhr.org \u2014 and download its helpful pamphlet (available in English, Spanish and Chinese) \u201cMedi-Cal Recovery: What You Need to Know and How to Avoid It.\u201d\n\n\u2022 If you want a list of medical expenses to date that may be subject to an estate recovery claim, call Medi-Cal at 800-541-5555 to request the necessary Form 6236. Fill that out and submit the $25 processing fee.\n\n\u2022 Living trusts will not protect your estate from recovery, McGinnis said. The best way to avoid recovery is to have nothing left in your name at the time of death, she adds. Consult the CANHR pamphlet for more advice.\n\n\u2022 If the state files a recovery claim, get an itemized billing of benefits paid and review them for errors. Some benefits, such as In-Home Supportive Services, are exempt from payback.\n\n\u2022 Call CANHR for free Medi-Cal counseling through its lawyer referral service at 800-474-1116.\n\nIf you\u2019d like to submit a query, email AskEmily@usc.edu.
