The hybrid store opened last month, and more are likely if it succeeds.\n\nThe \u201ckitchen\u201d is part of a growth story at Edina-based Lund Food Holdings that has run counter to the relative hard times in recent years at Twin Cities\u2019 other traditional grocery chains, Cub Foods and Rainbow Foods.\n\nLunds has opened new stores and increased market share, thriving in a higher-income niche. Cub and Rainbow have been caught in the middle, losing business to low-price chains like Wal-Mart and Target.\n\n\u201cLunds has been executing well,\u201d said David Livingston, a Wisconsin-based supermarket industry analyst. \u201cThey have differentiated themselves and given people a compelling reason to come to their stores.\u201d\n\nThe company plans to open a new Lunds supermarket \u2014 its 13th \u2014 next month in downtown St. Paul. But perhaps its most interesting project right now is Lunds and Byerly\u2019s Kitchen, which combines the names of Lunds\u2019 two Twin Cities chains.\n\nMuch of the 17,000-square-foot store is devoted to prepared food, all made on site.\n\nIt\u2019s got some grocery basics, but beverages and produce stand out. There\u2019s a cheese shop and butcher\u2019s counter too. But much of its 17,000 square feet is devoted to prepared food, from sandwiches to sushi to scads of hot dishes and salads, all made on site.\n\n\u201cThis is a chance to push the food service envelope, \u201d said CEO Tres Lund, whose grandfather founded Lunds 75 years ago. \u201cEverything here is geared toward packaged food to go, \u201d he said as he walked through Lunds and Byerly\u2019s Kitchen. \u201cIt\u2019s really geared toward dine in and takeout.\u201d\n\nAbout 4,000 square feet of the store is taken up by a 143-seat restaurant. Diners order from a menu via an iPad, or buy prepared food from various stations in the grocery store and eat it in the restaurant. The bar has 30 beers and 65 varieties of wine.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unusual, \u201d said John Dean, a Twin Cities supermarket consultant. \u201cMost grocers have enough trouble keeping their heads above water, and don\u2019t push into that sort of thing. It\u2019s hard enough to sell groceries.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not that uncommon for grocery stores to have restaurants; Byerly\u2019s in Golden Valley has one. But outlets with restaurants tend be full-scale supermarkets of 50,000 square feet or so, not a boutique grocery. In other words, food service is secondary, which is not the case at Lunds and Byerly\u2019s Kitchen.\n\nA large Lunds supermarket is just a few blocks away in Wayzata, but Tres Lund said the two outlets\u2019 missions don\u2019t really overlap.\n\nWayzata is the testing ground for Lunds and Byerly\u2019s Kitchen. \u201cWe\u2019re going to spend a number of months just watching how things play out,\u201d Lund said. \u201cIf this works, there\u2019s a number of different places we could take it in this market.\u201d\n\nLund declined to disclose the company\u2019s investment in the new kitchen concept. The privately held company, owned by the Lund family, also does not divulge sales.\n\nLunds provided data from Nielsen Co. showing that Lunds and Byerly\u2019s together have an 8.85 percent share of the Twin Cities grocery market, up from 6.88 percent in 2010.\n\nWhile Lunds competes with Cub and Rainbow, it goes head-to-head with other higher-end chains, notably Kowalski\u2019s and Whole Foods, which is expanding in the Twin Cities.\n\nThe competition will heat up more when Des Moines-based Hy-Vee enters the market with four to six stores, which are also slated to have bar service. Hy-Vee announced its Twin Cities foray in February.\n\nLunds opened a new store in downtown Minneapolis in 2012. It bought a Village Market in Prior Lake last fall and converted it to a Lunds. More growth is on tap.\n\n\u201cThere are more areas of geographic coverage we\u2019d love to have in the Twin Cities,\u201d Lund said. \u201cIt\u2019s safe to say we\u2019ll build one store a year in the next five years.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Rainbow has been in retreat, closing five of its 32 Twin Cities supermarkets in the past 14 months. Cub, the Twin Cities\u2019 largest grocery chain, has managed to keep all of its stores open, but it has progressively lost market share.\n\nCub and Rainbow have the misfortune of being in the middle of a grocery market that is increasingly gravitating toward low-price models on one end, high-quality, high-touch service on the other. Lunds fits into the latter, which is also a higher-price model.\n\nLunds, Livingston said, \u201cis for people who are just a little more serious about food and are a little more particular about what they buy.\u201d\n\nSome of the gourmet charcuterie on offer includes prosciutto from Italy and Iowa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "While others fight for price-focused shoppers, Lunds and Byerly's is opening new locations and experimenting with a new store concept: About a third of the size of a conventional store, this one focuses on prepared foods and features a large restaurant complete with beer and wine.", "title": "Lunds goes after growth in a high-end niche with new concept store", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/lunds-goes-after-growth-in-a-high-end-niche-with-new-concept-store/253855271/", "image": {"url": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_139658488711409.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "width": 1200, "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_139658488711409.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "twitter": {"description": "While others fight for price-focused shoppers, Lunds and Byerly's is opening new locations and experimenting with a new store concept: About a third of the size of a conventional store, this one focuses on prepared foods and features a large restaurant complete with beer and wine.", "title": "Lunds goes after growth in a high-end niche with new concept store", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/lunds-goes-after-growth-in-a-high-end-niche-with-new-concept-store/253855271/", "image": {"src": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_139658488711409.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_139658488711409.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "description": "While others fight for price-focused shoppers, Lunds and Byerly's is opening new locations and experimenting with a new store concept: About a third of the size of a conventional store, this one focuses on prepared foods and features a large restaurant complete with beer and wine."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3e99\"", "article_summary": "But perhaps its most interesting project right now is Lunds and Byerly\u2019s Kitchen, which combines the names of Lunds\u2019 two Twin Cities chains.\nAbout a third of the size of a conventional grocery store, Lunds and Byerly\u2019s Kitchen focuses on prepared foods and features a large restaurant complete with beer and wine.\n\u201cThere are more areas of geographic coverage we\u2019d love to have in the Twin Cities,\u201d Lund said.\n\u201cEverything here is geared toward packaged food to go, \u201d he said as he walked through Lunds and Byerly\u2019s Kitchen.\nThe Lunds and Byerly\u2019s Kitchen in Wayzata is like nothing the grocery company has done before."}
