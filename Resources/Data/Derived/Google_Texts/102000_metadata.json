Centene, which is also publicly traded, had gained projected enrollment last month after challenging a contract decision in September by the Agency for Health Care Administration, as Health News Florida reported.\n\nBut according to the latest report from Tom Carroll, a Stifel analyst, WellCare moved back into \"pole position\" on Oct. 31 after it was awarded contracts in Region 4, which includes Baker, Clay, Duval, Flagler, Nassau, St. Johns and Volusia counties.\n\nBased on all of the contract awards, including those announced in September and more recent additions in October, WellCare is likely to end up with 669,000 Florida Medicaid members, Carroll said. Centene is projected to have total membership of 606,000.\n\nMost of those members are young children and their mothers. Those who haven't enrolled in an HMO by next year -- and many already have -- will be required to do so, region by region.\n\nAHCA is currently busy enrolling a different population in managed care: low-income elderly and disabled patients who are in nursing homes or in the community but need assistance to remain there.\n\nThe statewide Medicaid managed care initiative is aimed at improving coordination of care, keeping patients healthy and holding costs down, AHCA says.\n\n--Health News Florida is part of WUSF Public Media.
