Seguin\u2019s goal was his first in seven games, and Spezza has only two in 15 games.\n\n\u201cWe need them on the board on a consistent basis,\u201d Stars coach Lindy Ruff said. \u201cTyler\u2019s missed some unbelievable chances. But at the same time, that goal by Benn, because they\u2019ve been few and far between, is important to get him going again.\u201d\n\nRoussel broke a 3-3 tie 3:14 into the third by tapping in the puck from left of the net. Benn added his goal at 3:30.\n\nSeguin, Spezza and Erik Cole each had a goal and an assist, and Jyrki Jokipakka added two assists for Dallas.\n\nCole said that settling on a line with Spezza and Ales Hemsky has helped.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s helped game in, game out to talk about things,\u201d Cole said. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to work consistently [by] moving up and down the lineup and having a bunch of different parts moving in and out.\u201d\n\nBenn, Seguin and Colton Sceviour have been working as Dallas\u2018 first line.\n\nAlex Ovechkin\u2019s breakaway goal 21 seconds into the third period helped Washington rally from a three-goal deficit.\n\n\u201cWe made some big mistakes at just critical times,\u201d Ruff said. \u201cEven to start the period shooting the puck into shin pads and giving Ovechkin a breakaway. To that point, we had done a pretty good job limiting his opportunities.\u201d\n\nBarely three minutes after Ovechkin\u2019s goal, Roussel and Benn gave the Stars the goals they needed to win.\n\n\u201cYou work all the way [back],\u201d Capitals coach Barry Trotz said. \u201cIt\u2019s like you\u2019re building something and then all of a sudden, it gets knocked down right away. Within not even a minute, we gave them a two-goal lead again.\u201d\n\nThe Stars kept Washington from scoring a tying goal after Nicklas Backstrom beat Kari Lehtonen at 16:34 of the third period.\n\nEric Fehr and Andre Burakovsky also scored for Washington, which took a second consecutive loss for the first time since Dec. 2.\n\nLehtonen made 28 saves. Justin Peters had 21 in his first start since Nov. 29 for Washington.\n\n\u201c[Lehtonen] definitely saved the game in the third period for them,\u201d Ovechkin said. \u201cHe\u2019s a top-level goalie and when they needed it, he made a save.\u201d\n\nSeguin, Cole and Spezza scored for the 3-0 lead at 4:13 of the second period.\n\nWashington rallied to come within a goal at 3-2 later in the second. Fehr scored at 5:30, putting a pass from Joel Ward between Lehtonen\u2019s legs, and Burakovsky sent a drive from the top of the slot past Dallas\u2018 goalie at 16:06.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Antoine Roussel and Jamie Benn scored 16 seconds apart in the third period, and the Dallas Stars edged the Washington Capitals 5-4 on Saturday night after losing a three-goal lead.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Antoine Roussel and Jamie Benn scored 16 seconds apart in the third period, and the Dallas Stars edged the Washington Capitals 5-4 on Saturday night after losing a three-goal lead.", "title": "Pair of goals in 16-second span thwart Capitals\u2019 comeback attempt", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jan/18/pair-goals-16-second-span-thwart-capitals-comeback/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/01/17/17cdad16e6388a026b0f6a7067005a66.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/01/17/17cdad16e6388a026b0f6a7067005a66.jpg", "description": "Antoine Roussel and Jamie Benn scored 16 seconds apart in the third period, and the Dallas Stars edged the Washington Capitals 5-4 on Saturday night after losing a three-goal lead.", "card": "summary", "title": "Pair of goals in 16-second span thwart Capitals\u2019 comeback attemp"}, "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Sports, Tyler Seguin, Dallas, Jason Spezza, Dallas Stars"}, "article_summary": "DALLAS \u2014 Jamie Benn\u2019s first goal in six games turned out to be the winner for the Dallas Stars.\n\u201cHe\u2019s a top-level goalie and when they needed it, he made a save.\u201dSeguin, Cole and Spezza scored for the 3-0 lead at 4:13 of the second period.\nAntoine Roussel and Benn scored 16 seconds apart in the third period, and Dallas edged the Washington Capitals 5-4 on Saturday night after losing a 3-0 lead.\nBenn, Tyler Seguin and Jason Spezza, the Stars\u2018 three leading scorers, all scored to show signs that they\u2019re coming out of slumps.\n\u201cI think that\u2019s helped game in, game out to talk about things,\u201d Cole said."}
