An environmentalist “clad in flippers and a bright yellow wet suit” did not even come close to completing his attempt to swim across New York City’s Gowanus Canal on Wednesday.

Christopher Swain planned to swim across the 1.8 mile canal but quit after just half a mile when low-tide put him in contact with the poop-covered surface of the canal, according to a New York Post report.

“The water is bad. It stinks,” said Swain. “There’s a lot of poop in there.”

Swain said that the water tasted “like mud, poop, ground up grass, detergent and gasoline.”

Swain also vowed that he will be back and complete his trip across what the Post described as a “crap-bombed creek.”
