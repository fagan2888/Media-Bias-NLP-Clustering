Hospice care may be more humane and more in keeping with a patient\u2019s preferences, but providers make less money under those circumstances.\n\nForty-two percent of the 286,000 Medicare patients who died in 2009 died in a hospice facility. But more than a quarter of those patients in hospice care had been there for three days or less. And 40 percent of those came from a hospital\u2019s intensive care.\n\nThe report says this tendency to hang on to such patients in expensive settings has likely gotten worse in the last five years.\n\nThis report, in short, is a slam on American medicine. But Dr. Robert Fine, the director of clinical ethics and palliative care at the Baylor Scott & White Health System, said he\u2019s thrilled.\n\n\u201cI was blown away with it,\u201d Fine said. \u201cI feel like the IOM [Institute of Medicine] kind of read our game plan.\u201d\n\nPalliative care\n\nBaylor\u2019s palliative care teams work with patients suffering the physical, emotional and spiritual pain of chronic illnesses like cancer. They work alongside colleagues trying to cure or push a patient\u2019s illness into remission. But they are on salary. They have no financial incentive to bring patients to the hospital to die, and no problem with spending 90 minutes helping a patient and family walk through an advanced medical directive.\n\nBaylor University Medical Center and Parkland Memorial Hospital provide palliative care, but most other hospitals in Dallas do not. Most Dallas hospitals, in fact, are subject to the kinds of criticism found in the Institute of Medicine report.\n\nDr. Leonard D. Schaeffer, whom the University of Southern California\u2019s Leonard D. Schaeffer Center for Health Policy & Economics was named for, was one of 21 committee members who worked on the \u201cDying in America\u201d report.\n\n\u201cThe whole history of health insurance has been about reimbursing for medical care on a fee-for-service basis. And this report says that\u2019s all got to be changed,\u201d Schaeffer said. \u201cAnd it says if you can\u2019t do it within the law, guess what? You ought to change the law. That is a fairly radical change for the good old Institute of Medicine.\u201d\n\nMedical directives\n\nWhen it came out last week, much of the attention on \u201cDying in America\u201d concerned its recommendation that physicians be paid for consulting with their patients about end-of-life care. This was tried during the the Affordable Care Act debate, but got blasted as a promotion of \u201cdeath panels\u201d to decide who gets advanced care and who dies.\n\n\u201cDying in America\u2019s\u201d authors say this is instead about paying physicians for the time they spend discussing a patient\u2019s preferences \u2014 the sort of things covered in advanced medical directives and living wills. And they say it\u2019s never too early to begin those conversations.\n\nWaiting until a patient nears death is waiting too long. Because of cognitive, physical or mental inability, most of us nearing the end of life aren\u2019t able to make those sorts of decisions.\n\nFine said Texas\u2019 medical wills make it easy for patients to state whether they want all possible medical interventions to stay alive or if they\u2019d rather just slip quietly away with a minimum of pain and care. Getting down to specifics, however, is not easy when insurers don\u2019t want to pay for it.\n\nThe report is available online at www.iom.edu/Reports/2014/Dying-In-America-Improving-Quality-and-Honoring-Individual-Preferences-Near-the-End-of-Life.aspx.\n\nFollow Jim Landers on Twitter at @landersjim.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A new report slams a medical system that doesn\u2019t let patients decide and wastes a lot of money.", "og": {"description": "A new report slams a medical system that doesn\u2019t let patients decide and wastes a lot of money.", "title": "Landers: A broken way of treating the dying", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/columnists/jim-landers/20140922-landers-a-broken-way-of-treating-the-dying.ece", "image": {"width": 345, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/resrsc/images/facebook-default.jpg", "height": 345}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2014-09-23T02:19:32Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2014-09-23T02:06:32Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Landers: A broken way of treating the dying\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/business/columnists/jim-landers/20140922-landers-a-broken-way-of-treating-the-dying.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/resrsc/images/facebook-default.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"1935174\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-09-23T02:06:32Z\", \"section\": \"Jim Landers\", \"author\": \"Jim Landers\", \"tags\": [\"dallas\", \"dallas fort worth\", \"dallas news\", \"dallas fort worth news\", \"dfw news\", \"dallas local news\", \"dallas fort worth local news\", \"dallas newspaper\", \"dallas morning news\", \"dallas morning news newspaper\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 1043783589, "page_id": 20946638799, "app_id": 258290334265148}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"image": "http://www.dallasnews.com/resrsc/images/facebook-default.jpg", "publishtime": "2014-09-23T02:06:32Z"}}, "news_keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb38a\"", "article_summary": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Treatment for the dying in the American health care system is broken, says an Institute of Medicine report released last week.\nMost Dallas hospitals, in fact, are subject to the kinds of criticism found in the Institute of Medicine report.\n\u201cThe whole history of health insurance has been about reimbursing for medical care on a fee-for-service basis.\nBut more than a quarter of those patients in hospice care had been there for three days or less.\nBaylor University Medical Center and Parkland Memorial Hospital provide palliative care, but most other hospitals in Dallas do not."}
