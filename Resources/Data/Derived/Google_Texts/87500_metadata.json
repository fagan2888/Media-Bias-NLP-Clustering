Brent oil futures settled down 63 cents or 1.4 percent at $44.48 a barrel, while U.S. oil futures finished $1.09 or 2.49 percent lower at 42.64 following a report that showed a spike in U.S. crude inventory. A weaker dollar limited the drop in oil prices, keeping them not far from five-month highs. The dollar index fell 0.3 percent at 94.82.
