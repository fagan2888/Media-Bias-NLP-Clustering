John McCollister of Omaha told colleagues during legislative debate his bill, LB 1032, addressed many of the concerns expressed in past debates about Medicaid expansion.\n\n\u201cIn a wider application of the Golden Rule, how can we turn our backs on 97,000 fellow Nebraskans? More simply put, how can we turn our backs on our neighbors when the remedy is so easy?\u201d McCollister asked.\n\nIt was the fourth year in a row the Unicameral addressed the issue.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like Deja vu all over again,\u201d Sen. Kathy Campbell said in addressing the legislature.\n\nCampbell, who has unsuccessfully sponsored similar measures in the past, told fellow senators the latest proposal addressed concerns expressed during past debates. It proposed a three-year pilot program, funded not through General Revenue funds, but through money from the tobacco settlement. It also proposed using private insurance and requiring minor co-pays.\n\nCampbell asked opponents to give the latest proposal a chance.\n\n\u201cThat is why we said, let\u2019s do a pilot. Let\u2019s do an 1115 waiver and give us three years to prove that this can work,\u201d Campbell stated.\n\nYet, Sen. Beau McCoy of Omaha said the Congressional Budget Office recently released a report stating the cost of implementation of the Affordable Care Act has risen dramatically, mostly due to the expansion of Medicaid.\n\n\u201cIt talked about that this new evidence proves the point, which many of us have been saying, now the fourth time as it\u2019s been said that we\u2019ve dealt with this issue, that the costs aren\u2019t controllable and that they aren\u2019t even predictable,\u201d according to McCoy.\n\nSen. Heath Mello of Omaha told colleagues they cannot ignore the problem.\n\n\u201cColleagues, the issue will not go away,\u201d Mello said. \u201cNot moving forward on the most conservative policy option to address the uninsured in the country colleagues does not make 97,000 Nebraskans leave our state to go find health insurance somewhere else.\u201d\n\nBut, Sen. Merv Riepe of Ralston said the debate boils down to one question: is health care a right?\n\n\u201cIf we contend health care is a right, to how much health care is each citizen entitled?\u201d Riepe asked. \u201cIs each of us entitled to health insurance if we have led a life of bad habits and addictions?\u201d\n\nSen. Bill Kintner of Papillion argued expansion is unsustainable even if the federal government foots 90% of the bill.\n\n\u201cA couple of things we do know, Mr. President,\u201d Kintner said. \u201cWe do know that whenever you expand Medicaid, no matter what form, there is always a lot more people than you think, they are sicker than you think, and cost more than you think.\u201d\n\nOpponents of Medicaid expansion have successfully used the filibuster the past three years to block a vote on expansion. This year, the bracket motion came before the filibuster had run its course.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Nebraska Radio Network", "description": "State legislators have effectively killed Medicaid expansion, once again.
