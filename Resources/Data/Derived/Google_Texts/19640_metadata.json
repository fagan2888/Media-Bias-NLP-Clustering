Steptoe wrote an autobiographical monologue about being HIV positive. ( Farida Jhabvala Romero/KQED )\n\nFor decades, Cassandra Steptoe felt like she couldn\u2019t talk about her HIV diagnosis with anyone.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t forgive myself for getting HIV,\u201d says Steptoe, who spent much of her early adult life in and out of jail for shoplifting and burglaries linked to her IV drug use. \u201cBut someone told me a long time ago, if you are looking for a reason to feel shame, you can always find it. I learned to look for something else: forgiveness.\u201d\n\nFor Steptoe, now 59 and a grandmother, it wasn\u2019t until her 40s \u2014 after decades of struggling with addiction \u2014 that she finally completed a rehab program and committed to ongoing HIV treatment.\n\nToday she talks openly about that experience onstage, as part of a theater project aimed at inspiring others. The quote about learning to forgive herself is part of an autobiographical monologue Steptoe wrote and performs in a San Francisco theater production of The Medea Project: Theater for Incarcerated Women/HIV Circle.\n\nIt was Steptoe\u2019s physician, Dr. Edward Machtinger, who first told her about the project. Established by playwright and director Rhodessa Jones in 2008 as an extension of an improvisational production that draws on and explores the experiences of jailed women, the \u201cHIV Circle\u201d focuses on the experiences of women living with the AIDS virus.\n\nThe therapeutic aspect of the performance workshop is called peer empowerment, explains Machtinger, an internist and director of the Women\u2019s HIV Program at the University of California, San Francisco. The strength and healing Steptoe and others have gained from processing and sharing their stories this way is profound, he says \u2014 and can serve as a model for helping other patients deal with psychological trauma.\n\n\n\n\n\nMedications \u2018Not Enough\u2019\n\nWith the theater group, Steptoe began writing about her experiences and sharing them with a small group of women, some of whom had gone through similar struggles of addiction and histories of incarceration. The process of uncovering her past and making sense of her experiences in a cathartic, supportive environment helped Steptoe end her feelings of isolation.\n\n\u201cHaving these women that really love you and support you \u2026 it feels good to have some real friends, \u2019cause I never had that before,\u201d Steptoe says. \u201cWe\u2019re all sharing something together \u2019cause we all get something out of everybody\u2019s story.\u201d\n\nThe potential of peer empowerment is not just anecdotal. Machtinger has studied the Medea Project\u2019s life-saving impact on his patients.\n\nMachtinger says the patients in the Medea Project followed by his research team went through an extraordinary transformation. Many who had barely disclosed their HIV status to anyone when they began, became activists and leaders in their communities, helping to destigmatize HIV while pursuing personal goals and leading productive lives.\n\n\u201cFor them to develop what they described as \u201csisterhood\u201d was the most important and most profound type of healing that I ever witnessed,\u201d Machtinger says.\n\nHe began seeking alternative methods to help his patients after increasingly noticing that a large proportion were successfully receiving antiretroviral treatment, but still dying from reasons that had \u201cnothing to do with HIV,\u201d such as murder, suicide or drug overdose.\n\n\u201cThey could have their HIV under control, (but) their lives were not getting better,\u201d Machtinger says. \u201cThat was because their core issue \u2014 a life of trauma and the impacts of depression, isolation and shame \u2014 wasn\u2019t being effectively addressed. And to us, that\u2019s not acceptable.\u201d\n\nMachtinger\u2019s experience is reverberating beyond the Medea Project. He says witnessing and studying the impact of peer empowerment has helped inform a broader role. He is part of an advisory group helping to develop new guidelines for trauma-informed primary care for the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.\n\nThe new guidelines will likely include a substantial focus on interventions with peer empowerment as one ingredient to help people with severe trauma heal, says Machtinger.\n\n\u201cThe core elements of the Medea Project are really lessons for other interventions to help people overcome trauma and other stigmatizing situations and conditions,\u201d says Machtinger, adding that childhood and adult trauma have been linked to a variety of illnesses, such as hepatitis C, heart disease and diabetes.\n\nHe expects the new guidelines for primary care clinics and other health providers to be finalized and published later this year.\n\nTrauma at the Root of HIV Diagnosis\n\nSteptoe now realizes she was infected with HIV through unprotected sex and sharing needles. She used to be addicted to heroin and cocaine. During a decades-long period of her life, she was in and out of the criminal justice system. She worked as a prostitute and survived abusive relationships \u2014 getting beat up so badly one time that she spent three months recovering at a hospital, she said.\n\nSteptoe says experiencing sexual abuse repeatedly as a child and teen led her on the path that eventually resulted in HIV infection.\n\n\u201cSexual abuse came from family,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I guess I was kind of covering all that up by choosing the drugs. It kind of took me out there into the street, looking for love in the wrong places because I didn\u2019t have it at home. I started shooting drugs and that led into prostitution and to prison.\u201d\n\nRecent studies show that HIV-positive women suffer disproportionately from high rates of trauma and post-traumatic stress disorder. The high rates of trauma also lead to increased risk of further spreading HIV, according to researchers.\n\nTransforming Her Life\n\nNow Steptoe is busy and full of energy. She takes antiretroviral medication religiously every morning, eats a healthy diet and works out by taking Zumba fitness classes at her gym.\n\nSteptoe, a mother of three and grandmother of nine has also taken full custody of her 8-year-old granddaughter, who frequently accompanies her to rehearsals.\n\n\u201cShe teaches me how to love, and she gives me patience,\u201d says Steptoe, who also cares for other kids in her Mission apartment building.\n\nRhodessa Jones, the Medea Project\u2019s dynamic and energetic director, says Steptoe has flourished since she joined the organization, becoming a leader and inspiration to other women.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s so powerful, positive and forceful. She gets it,\u201d says Jones, who founded Medea more than 23 years ago. \u201cTheater has really been expressive therapy for her. It gives her a space to speak her truth.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Medea Project uses Greek, Roman and African mythology to introduce \u201cthe universality of all of our stories,\u201d says Jones, who asked Steptoe to imagine going back in time to age 14 and write the lessons she would give herself. The result was Steptoe\u2019s piece \u201cYounger Self.\u201d\n\nSteptoe wrote the piece, performed in January in San Francisco, about the moment in 1987 when she first found out she was HIV-positive. She was serving time in jail and received a health checkup.\n\n\u201cMy world crashed. I didn\u2019t have no education of what I had, I didn\u2019t have no support,\u201d says Steptoe, adding that she considered her condition \u201ca death sentence\u201d at the time. \u201cI had to relive that again by writing this because I needed to heal.\u201d\n\n\u2018HIV is a Health Condition, Not a Crime\u2019\n\nAfter receiving the diagnosis, she remembers crying at night with a pillow over her head so others wouldn\u2019t hear.\n\nSteptoe then kept her HIV status a secret for many years.\n\nBut, years later, the key for her to find and use her voice was becoming a part of The Medea Project, she says. The main motivation for telling her story? She wants to give hope to others, and help them feel they are not alone.\n\n\u201cNow I can tell the world that HIV is just a health condition, not a crime,\u201d says Steptoe, who doesn\u2019t hesitate to share her story as a lead actress for Medea in front of audiences of hundreds of people.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have shame around it no more,\u201d Steptoe says. \u201cI let my grandkids know that even if you go the wrong way, you can still turn your life around.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Cassandra Steptoe is one of many women living with HIV whose lives have been changed working with The Medea Project.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"How Theater Helps This HIV-Positive Grandmother Transform Lives\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2016\\/04\\/01\\/how-theater-helped-hiv-positive-grandmother-health-medea-project\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2016-04-01 10:38:51\",\"mod_date\":\"2016-04-20 11:34:10\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":166815,\"author_id\":\"8659\",\"author_name\":\"Farida Jhabvala Romero\",\"author_display_name\":\"Farida Jhabvala Romero\",\"tags\":[\"Arts\",\"HIV\\/AIDS\",\"Mental Health\",\"News\"],\"categories\":[\"Community Health\",\"Tests &amp; Treatments\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2016\\/03\\/RS18861_IMG_9436-qut.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "Cassandra Steptoe is one of many women living with HIV whose lives have been changed working with The Medea Project.", "title": "How Theater Helps This HIV-Positive Grandmother Transform Lives", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2016/04/01/how-theater-helped-hiv-positive-grandmother-health-medea-project/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2016/03/RS18862_IMG_9445-qut.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@faridajhabvala"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "arts,hiv/aids,mental health,news", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Today she talks openly about that experience onstage, as part of a theater project aimed at inspiring others.\nThe quote about learning to forgive herself is part of an autobiographical monologue Steptoe wrote and performs in a San Francisco theater production of The Medea Project: Theater for Incarcerated Women/HIV Circle.\nBut, years later, the key for her to find and use her voice was becoming a part of The Medea Project, she says.\nAnd to us, that\u2019s not acceptable.\u201dMachtinger\u2019s experience is reverberating beyond the Medea Project.\nMachtinger says the patients in the Medea Project followed by his research team went through an extraordinary transformation."}
