DOJ officials did not provide a copy of the memo.\n\nLocal lawmakers have sought to discourage use of terms that they believe carry a stigma for ex-convicts.\n\nIn 2013 Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter signed an executive order that required city employees to use the term \u201creturning citizen\u201d when referring to a person who has been released from jail or prison.\n\nOver the course of National Reentry Week, the Obama administration announced a series of initiatives meant to support ex-offenders in the transition from prison. Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch last week reached out to state governors to encourage them to allow prisoners to exchange prison identification cards for state-issued IDs once their sentences are completed. President Obama announced plans to prohibit federal agencies from asking applicants for government jobs about any criminal history until the final phase in the hiring process.\n\nRefining the language used to refer to ex-offenders \u201cin no way means condoning criminal or delinquent behavior,\u201d Ms. Mason wrote.\n\n\u201cThose who commit crimes must be held accountable,\u201d she wrote. \u201cBut accountability requires making amends, an objective that is much harder to achieve when a person is denied the chance to move forward.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Justice Department's Office of Justice Programs is eschewing the terms \"felon\" and \"convict\" when officials refer to individuals convicted of crimes, opting instead for less \"disparaging labels,\" Assistant Attorney General Karol Mason announced.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The Justice Department\u2019s Office of Justice Programs is eschewing the terms \u201cfelon\u201d and \u201cconvict\u201d when officials refer to individuals convicted of crimes, opting instead for less \u201cdisparaging labels,\u201d Assistant Attorney General Karol Mason announced.", "title": "Justice Dept. program to no longer use terms \u2018felon,\u2019 \u2018convict\u2019 to refer to criminals: \u2018Disparaging\u2019", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/may/4/justice-dept-no-longer-use-terms-felon-convict/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/11/08/a9d6168bf2fad92b640f6a706700f361.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/11/08/a9d6168bf2fad92b640f6a706700f361.jpg", "description": "The Justice Department's Office of Justice Programs is eschewing the terms \"felon\" and \"convict\" when officials refer to individuals convicted of crimes, opting instead for less \"disparaging labels,\"", "card": "summary", "title": "Justice Dept. program to no longer use terms \u2018felon,\u2019 R"}, "Author": "Andrea Noble", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Law Crime, Karol Mason"}, "article_summary": "The Justice Department\u2019s Office of Justice Programs is eschewing the terms \u201cfelon\u201d and \u201cconvict\u201d when officials refer to individuals convicted of crimes, opting instead for less \u201cdisparaging labels,\u201d Assistant Attorney General Karol Mason announced last week.\nOver the course of National Reentry Week, the Obama administration announced a series of initiatives meant to support ex-offenders in the transition from prison.\nRefining the language used to refer to ex-offenders \u201cin no way means condoning criminal or delinquent behavior,\u201d Ms. Mason wrote.\nA criminal record can prevent people from obtaining employment, housing, higher education or credit, the Justice Department noted.\nLocal lawmakers have sought to discourage use of terms that they believe carry a stigma for ex-convicts."}
