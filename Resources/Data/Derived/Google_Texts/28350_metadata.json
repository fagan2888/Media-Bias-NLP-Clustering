The classic benefits package of healthcare services includes the \u201cessential package of health care services\u201d that requires a high premium that is unaffordable to those with a low income. This is why many types of private health insurance essentially have the employed middle class subsidized by the employer and a high income or rich people. In countries where social security with a health or medical scheme exists (national compulsory pool) or in the case of the United States\u2019 Affordable Care Act, those with a low-income receive cross subsidies from a high income or government tax subsidies.\n\nThe model contained in this book is constructed for 10 million of the population. It is estimated that $1 a month in developing countries, $1 a week in newly industrialized countries, and $1 a day in developed countries should finance a limited number of expensive, unaffordable healthcare services. These healthcare services include major surgery, complicated birth deliveries (cesarean sections and other procedures), and cancer treatment. The covered services are medical consultations, diagnostic exams (laboratory, imagery, etc.), and drugs. To make the model more attractive and sustainable, the quality and efficiency of healthcare services and the efficiency of health insurance administration were added. The inclusion of quality and efficiency is an innovation in health insurance businesses. By balancing the proposed premium and benefits, the business is profitable at all levels of development and economy of countries. Adding quality and efficiency should increase profitability and allows the expansion of members\u2019 benefits.\n\nThe following are the three pillars of the model: (i) a large economy of scale for strong cost sharing that enables business profit and enough protection; (ii) financing a limited number of unaffordable healthcare risks to be attractive; and (iii) value financing in terms of the quality and efficiency of healthcare services.\n\nThe model is proposed as a profitable social business that aims to attract investments for reducing or preventing the impoverishment of the low-income population caused by expensive health care.\n\nThe following link provides detail description and selling bookstores: http://internationaldoctorbooking.com/index.php/en/7-book-one-dollar-health-insurance\n\n\n\n\n\nCONTACT Claude Sekabaraga Email: csekabaraga@internationaldoctorbooking.com", "article_metadata": {"original-source": "http://globenewswire.com/news-release/2016/02/22/812943/0/en/International-Doctor-Booking-Announces-a-New-Book-on-Affordable-Health-Care-Model-Titled-One-Dollar-Health-Insurance.html", "author": "INTERNATIONAL DOCTOR BOOKING,LLC", "og": {"site_name": "GlobeNewswire News Room", "title": "International Doctor Booking Announces a New Book on Affordable Health Care Model Titled \u2018One Dollar Health Insurance'", "url": "http://globenewswire.com/news-release/2016/02/22/812943/0/en/International-Doctor-Booking-Announces-a-New-Book-on-Affordable-Health-Care-Model-Titled-One-Dollar-Health-Insurance.html", "image": "http://globenewswire.com/news-release/2016/02/22/812943/0/en/photos/378224/0/378224.jpg?lastModified=02%2F22%2F2016%2016%3A12%3A37&size=2", "locale": "en_US", "article": {"tag": "INTERNATIONAL DOCTOR BOOKING,LLC,", "published_time": "2/22/2016 9:11:47 PM", "author": "INTERNATIONAL DOCTOR BOOKING,LLC"}, "type": "article"}, "title": "International Doctor Booking Announces a New Book on Affordable Health Care Model Titled \u2018One Dollar Health Insurance'", "DC.date.issued": "2/22/2016", "keywords": "INTERNATIONAL DOCTOR BOOKING,LLC", "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=no, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "To make the model more attractive and sustainable, the quality and efficiency of healthcare services and the efficiency of health insurance administration were added.\nThese healthcare services include major surgery, complicated birth deliveries (cesarean sections and other procedures), and cancer treatment.\nThis is why many types of private health insurance essentially have the employed middle class subsidized by the employer and a high income or rich people.\nThe inclusion of quality and efficiency is an innovation in health insurance businesses.\nThe classic benefits package of healthcare services includes the \u201cessential package of health care services\u201d that requires a high premium that is unaffordable to those with a low income."}
