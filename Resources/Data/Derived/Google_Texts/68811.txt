Google’s divisive Glass technology will soon be available to the masses — for a limited time only. A slide, leaked to The Verge, divulges Google’s latest plans for the wearable tech: An expansion of its Explorer Program. For “about a day” Glass will be on sale to anyone in the U.S. who has $1,500 to drop on a pair of wearable tech. The sale date could be as soon as next week on April 15.

Though the sale is being billed as expansion of the Explorer Program, and not retail consumption, the move is the biggest push by Google to broaden the user base. The $1,500 price tag comes with a “free frame or shade.” Google Glass is supposedly due for wide release at the end of 2014.
