MARTINEZ, Calif. – April is Volunteer Appreciation Month at Contra Costa Regional Medical Center (CCRMC).

What is a volunteer? For Jo-Ann Lee, auxiliary president at CCRMC, “a volunteer is somebody who contributes time, effort, and talents to meet a need to further a mission without going on the payroll.”

The Auxiliary at CCRMC began volunteer month with an annual meeting to honor volunteers and present recognition awards. “It was held in the hospital lobby beginning with refreshments,” said Deloris McDonald, publicity chairman.

Rhonda Smith, Volunteer Program Coordinator, presented recognition and service pins to Charis Anderson (308 hours, 1 year) and Richard Frith who in 2013 completed 1,031 hours (4,700 hours, 6 years). Ms. Smith stated, “As we celebrate National Volunteer Month, let’s recognize those who give themselves to help others. Let’s encourage and motivate others to join us at Contra Costa Regional Medical Center. Let’s stay focused on how volunteerism can continue to evolve and bring maximum benefit to the world locally and globally.”

The guest speaker was Dr. William Walker, director of the Contra Costa Health Services Department. He discussed the Affordable Care Act (Covered California), how it will be handled within the county and the role volunteers play in this new deli­very system. Dr. Walker is proud to say he worked with Congressman George Miller with the development of this plan and that CCRMC and Health Clinics have become a model for other hospitals.

The meeting concluded with the voting of officers for the coming year. They are Jo-Ann Lee, president; Bill Cunningham, vice president; Janet Betz, secretary; and Zara Koerber, treasurer.

All volunteers were members of the Auxiliary. Those interested in volunteering can visit http://www.cchealth.org.
