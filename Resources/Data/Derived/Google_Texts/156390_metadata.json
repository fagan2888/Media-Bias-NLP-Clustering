The employment gains from January and February were 37,000 higher than previously reported. During the 2012 presidential election, it held true that if the jobs report showed gains above 150,000, that was a good one-day story for the president (even though there is a healthy margin of error and revisions). If it was below, that wound up being bad. Now, it seems Wall Street\u2019s expectations have increased to closer to 200,000, and the political expectations have moved along with it, especially since 11 of 14 months from October 2013 to November 2014 showed gains of 200,000 or close to it. And the unemployment rate has steadily and slowly declined from a high of 10 percent in October 2009 to in the 6s. For Democrats hoping to point to an improving economy heading into the midterms, Friday\u2019s report isn\u2019t likely to give them much of a jolt, but it isn\u2019t bad either.\n\nThis week by the numbers: Given Friday\u2019s jobs report, here\u2019s a look at the week, by the numbers:\n\n7.1 million: The number the White House says signed up for the Affordable Care Act, surpassing the 7 million sign-up goal. The law is still far from a political winner for Democrats heading into the November midterms, but the number might quiet some of the attacks from the right (for now).\n\n5 to 4: The Supreme Court handed down a major campaign finance decision Wednesday lifting the cap on the overall amount one person can give to candidates, campaign committees and PACs in an election cycle.\n\n$5.1 trillion: That\u2019s how much House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan\u2019s latest budget would cut over the next decade. It includes major changes to Medicare, Medicaid, and the tax code. Republicans aren\u2019t totally on board with it.\n\n17: House GOP leaders expressed confidence Ryan\u2019s budget would pass when it comes up for a vote next week, but without Democratic support, only 17 Republicans would have to break ranks for it to fail. Last year, without a campaign looming, 10 Republicans voted against it.\n\n55: The number of times House Republicans have now voted to repeal either all or some portion of the Affordable Care Act.\n\n$1.5 million: That\u2019s how much Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, is reportedly getting for an unwritten, untitled memoir. That\u2019s the most EVER for a conservative political book, even more than the $1.25 million Sarah Palin got.\n\n6 p.m. ET: Be sure to tune in to Friday\u2019s NewsHour, where Judy Woodruff will get analysis from Mark Shields and David Brooks on the week\u2019s political news.\n\n2014/2016 wrap \u2013 Bush-Jindal\u2026 Is that the ticket? Potential 2016 hopefuls Jeb Bush, the former Florida governor, and Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana will appear in a TV ad Sunday for NewRepublican.org, a PAC created last year to outline a positive agenda for the party\u2026 North Dakota Sen. Heidi Heitkamp is campaigning with West Virginia Secretary of State Natalie Tennant, running for the Senate. There is almost no state where President Obama is more UNPOPULAR than West Virginia, and Tennant needs surrogates, who speak, well, West Virginian. \u2026 Speaking of surrogates, Sarah Palin campaigned (again) for Karen Handel for Senate. She was a Palin favorite in her failed bid for governor in 2010. \u2026 Georgia Rep. Jack Kingston used an Obama impersonator to leave a fake voicemail in a new ad saying he doesn\u2019t want Kingston in the Senate. \u2026 My bad: Matt Bevin wound up speaking at a pro-cockfighting rally in Kentucky. He later said he didn\u2019t know he was at a cockfighting rally, but his campaign, when asked whether Bevin thought the practice should be legal, called it a state issue. \u2026 Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., is up with an anti-\u201cObamacare\u201d ad.\n\nQuote of the day: \u201cI just got a note saying I\u2019m in the wrong hearing.\u201d \u2013 Indiana Sen. Dan Coats, after realizing he showed up at the wrong hearing Thursday. But, hey, it could have been worse.\n\nAnother quote of the day: \u201cDon\u2019t paint your wife.\u201d \u2013 Former President George W. Bush on what not to do. Former First Lady Laura Bush said his portrait of her needed \u201csome work.\u201d\n\nLINE ITEMS\n\nTOP TWEETS\n\nI was going to a fundraiser and I ended up in a cockfighting rally, as one does. \u2014 Nick Confessore (@nickconfessore) April 3, 2014\n\nAnyone else ever find themselves wondering how President Santos and Secretary Vinick are doing? \u2014 McKay Coppins (@mckaycoppins) April 3, 2014\n\nTall tale of the day: Bao Bao scaled a tree this morning.
