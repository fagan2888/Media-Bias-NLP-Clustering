According to NECN, the increase will be Rhode Island\u2019s fourth minimum wage hike in four years.\n\nGov. Gina Raimondo, D-R.I., signed the bill into law on Monday.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to give a chance to Rhode Islanders who work hard and it\u2019s just a start, you know. Just even at $9.60, you know, it\u2019s very challenging working full-time at $9.60, it\u2019s still a huge challenge but it\u2019s a start. It\u2019s a step in the right direction,\u201d Raimondo said during the bill signing ceremony.\n\nIn a statement, President Obama praised Rhode Island\u2019s decision. \u201cSince I first called on Congress to increase the federal minimum wage in 2013, 17 states have acted on their own, which will grow the paychecks of millions of American workers,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis year, more than half of our states guarantee their workers a wage higher than the federal minimum, but despite this progress we still have work to do,\u201d Obama added. \u201cI continue to encourage states, cities, counties and companies to lift their workers\u2019 wages, and I urge Congress to finally do the right thing and give America a raise.\u201d\n\nOpponents say that a minimum wage hike places an additional burden on employers, particularly small businesses, and that it will reduce the number of available jobs.\n\n\u201cWhat we should be doing is lowering the burden, lowering the regulations on employers in the state and that\u2019s the only way we\u2019re ever going to see rapid growth,\u201d Mike Stenhouse, the CEO of the Rhode Island Center for Freedom and Prosperity, told WPRI.\n\nJames Sherk, the senior policy analyst in labor economics at The Heritage Foundation, said that \u201cdespite good intentions, raising the minimum wage hurts low income workers.\u201d\n\n\u201cEconomists Jeffrey Clemens and Michael Wither of the University of California, San Diego, recently released a study tracking the earnings of low-income workers after the 2007 minimum wage increase. They found their earnings dropped by an average of $150 a month. The higher wages caused employers to reduce hiring. While the pay of workers with jobs rose, many less-skilled workers became unable to find work. The net result was to make life harder for disadvantaged workers,\u201d Sherk said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "It went up another 60 cents.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "It went up another 60 cents.", "title": "Rhode Island Hikes Minimum Wage For Fourth Time in Four Years", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150623_RhodeIsland_Scanlon.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-06-23T18:40:16+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1Bz2lrD"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "It went up another 60 cents.", "title": "Rhode Island Hikes Minimum Wage For Fourth Time in Four Years", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150623_RhodeIsland_Scanlon.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Economy", "tag": "jobs", "published_time": "2015-06-23T17:59:44+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-23T18:40:16+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Rhode Island, Minimum Wage, minimum wage increase, living wage, Gina Raimondo"}, "article_summary": "Rhode Island lawmakers have approved legislation that will raise the state\u2019s minimum wage.\nAccording to NECN, the increase will be Rhode Island\u2019s fourth minimum wage hike in four years.\nThe Ocean State will increase its hourly wage from $9 to $9.60 starting on Jan. 1, 2016.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to give a chance to Rhode Islanders who work hard and it\u2019s just a start, you know.\nJames Sherk, the senior policy analyst in labor economics at The Heritage Foundation, said that \u201cdespite good intentions, raising the minimum wage hurts low income workers.\u201d\u201cEconomists Jeffrey Clemens and Michael Wither of the University of California, San Diego, recently released a study tracking the earnings of low-income workers after the 2007 minimum wage increase."}
