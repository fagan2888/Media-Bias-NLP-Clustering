The judge set the deadline after documents obtained via a FOIA request revealed agency officials had presented conflicting testimony, under oath, about the extent to which Lerner\u2019s hard drive had been damaged before it was allegedly destroyed.\n\nThe order, given by U.S. District Judge Emmet G. Sullivan, marks the next step in a long-brewing lawsuit against the IRS brought by nonprofit accountability organization Judicial Watch. From a report at The Daily Caller on the judge\u2019s order:\n\nAaron Signor, an IRS technician that looked at Lerner\u2019s hard drive in June 2011, said in IRS court filings that he saw no damage to the drive before sending it off to another IRS technician, leading some in the media to suggest that the lost emails scandal is basically over. But Signor\u2019s statement, issued in response to the Judicial Watch lawsuit, does not jibe with sworn congressional testimony. The Daily Caller reported that Lerner\u2019s hard drive was \u201cscratched\u201d and then \u201cshredded,\u201d according to a court filing the IRS made to the House Committee on Ways and Means. The IRS technology official who served as the source of the \u201cscratched\u201d and \u201cshredded\u201d revelation is believed to have looked at the hard drive after Signor. Sullivan\u2019s order seems to have been motivated by the obvious contradiction. Judicial Watch said that Sullivan made the order because the IRS\u2019 new court filing featuring Signor\u2019s statement was a \u201cjoke.\u201d\n\nYou can read the rest of that report here.\n\nWe\u2019ve been here before. Sullivan had initially ordered the IRS to submit a similar statement, under oath, in July, giving the agency 30 days to explain how Lerner\u2019s emails turned up missing. In a separate lawsuit brought by Texas conservative nonprofit True the Vote, another Federal judge decided earlier this month that the IRS would not be forced (in that case, at least) to submit to an independent forensic investigation searching for the missing emails.\n\nMeanwhile, investigative reporter Sharyl Attkisson revealed today that another Obama Administration official had requested an HHS spokesman to delete an email she had sent pertaining (it seems) to the botched rollout of the Obamacare website, Healthcare.gov. It\u2019s against the law for Federal officials to delete their work emails, which are instead supposed to be archived and printed.\n\nFrom Attkisson\u2019s website:", "article_metadata": {"projectnami": {"version": "1.3.3"}, "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Personal Liberty\u00ae", "description": "The IRS will have until August 22 to explain to a Federal judge how it is attempting to recover Lois Lerner\u2019s missing emails, as well as its policy relating to destroying computer equipment.", "title": "IRS Contradicts Itself On Lerner Hard Drive Testimony; Judge Sets Another Deadline For Agency To Get Its Story Straight", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://plnami.blob.core.windows.net/media/2013/07/wap20130522303_md.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-08-19T08:32:50+00:00", "url": "http://personalliberty.com/irs-contradicts-lerner-hard-drive-testimony-judge-sets-another-deadline-agency-get-story-straight/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://plnami.blob.core.windows.net/media/2013/07/wap20130522303_md.jpg", "description": "The IRS will have until August 22 to explain to a Federal judge how it is attempting to recover Lois Lerner\u2019s missing emails, as well as its policy relating to destroying computer equipment.", "card": "summary", "title": "IRS Contradicts Itself On Lerner Hard Drive Testimony; Judge Sets Another Deadline For Agency To Get Its Story Straight"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 135282966636750}, "google-site-verification": "bvYDjX4XBto8stfZA3uAxLxNaRlmJGvc5BQnIbK_wQo", "article": {"section": "Liberty News", "tag": "Lois Lerner", "published_time": "2014-08-15T17:25:25+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-19T08:32:50+00:00"}, "news_keywords": "U.S. District Judge Emmet G.
