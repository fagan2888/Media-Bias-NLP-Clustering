Not true.\n\nThe rosy unemployment figure masks the fact that Maine\u2019s total employment has actually declined over the last several years \u2013 we\u2019re approaching recession lows. More importantly, many who have lost jobs can\u2019t find work, and have stopped looking. Maine\u2019s participation rate (the percentage of Mainers with a job or looking for a job) has recently dropped sharply.\n\nMaine Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows: pre-recession total employment in Maine reached a high in December 2006 of 672,000; recession lows (December 2009) saw this figure drop to 636,000; 36,000 jobs were lost.\n\nAs Maine slowly climbed out of the recession, total employment (December 2013) rose to nearly 663,000 \u2013 27,000 jobs were recovered.\n\nBut this upward movement has not continued. Instead of gaining another 9,000 jobs to finally climb out of the recession, Maine lost 12,000 jobs. In March 2016, total employment stood at 651,000.\n\nMore ominously, Maine\u2019s participation rate, which had hovered around 65 percent for over six years, has dropped precipitously over the last two years \u2013 it now stands at 61.7 percent.\n\nIn short, it\u2019s not good news when our unemployment rate is artificially driven down by the bad news that we\u2019ve lost 12,000 jobs in two years, that many of the unemployed have stopped looking for work, and thus our participation rate is falling.\n\nThough some highly skilled/high tech employers can\u2019t find enough workers, the larger reality is, we face a jobs shortage. This shortage is largely due to LePage\u2019s backward-looking tax, spending and industrial development strategies.\n\nHe wants to breathe life into Maine\u2019s dying pulp and paper mills; he wants to cut more wood; he wants to forestall the closure of outmoded biomass plants \u2013 all with an eye to preserving jobs.\n\nBut these traditional employment activities are facing a national as well as a global squeeze \u2013 none of these activities are the employment wave of the future.\n\nHe wants \u201cOpen for Business\u201d zones where employers who invest $50 million and hire 1,500 people will get a myriad of tax breaks, investment credits, relief from existing labor laws, etc. This is little more than wishful thinking.\n\nOn a smaller scale, he champions \u201cNew Markets Tax Credits\u201d administered by the Finance Authority of Maine (FAME). Similar authorities in one form or another have existed for more than 40 years \u2013 there is no record of sustained job growth. Most recently FAME gave us the Cate Street Capital debacle \u2013 Maine taxpayers paid $16 million for nothing.\n\nWhat the Governor refuses to do (in spite of his small business rhetoric) is put the weight of his office behind small businesses/small projects that are the acknowledged driver of employment growth in Maine and the nation.\n\nFor example:\n\nThe Governor killed the solar energy bill \u2013 a carefully drafted compromise bill with bipartisan support \u2013 a bill that meets future energy needs. Passage would have allowed hundreds of small projects go forward, dozens of small firms throughout the state would be benefited. Hundreds (or more) jobs would have been created.\n\nThe Governor has repeatedly vetoed Maine\u2019s participation in the Affordable Care Act. Not only does this leave 80,000 Mainers without health care insurance, but it robs the state of millions of federal dollars that would have filtered into every corner of the state. Over 4,000 jobs in hospitals, doctors offices, rehab and testing facilities would be created almost immediately. Moreover, these health care-related jobs are projected to increase over time.\n\nThe Governor\u2019s past refusal to issue highway bonds robbed the state of construction jobs when we needed them most \u2013 unemployment was high, interest rates were low, bid prices were coming in below engineer\u2019s estimates, the backlog of work was (and remains) immense. Now he refuses to issue elderly housing bonds \u2013 more construction job opportunities will be lost.\n\nThe Governor killed offshore wind development by driving Statoil from the state; he has slowed onshore wind development. He ignores a jobs/energy source of the future. We were on the cutting edge: Statoil was prepared to invest $120 million in Maine, but they instead recently invested 10 times that amount in European offshore wind. Dozens of Maine firms have supplied onshore wind developers; this number would have expanded to meet Statoil\u2019s needs. The employment potential was huge.\n\nFinally, the Governor refuses to support a National Monument in the Katahdin region\u2013 a gift to the state (87,500 acres, which could be expanded to 150,000 acres and a $40 million dollar support endowment). This is one of the most economically depressed parts of Maine \u2013 historic jobs are gone. Any fool can see that Acadia National Park is an economic engine; it drives the whole Bar Harbor region. Hundreds of businesses benefit, thousands of jobs are created, and Katahdin holds a similar promise.\n\nBottom line: the Governor needs to stop chasing yesterday\u2019s jobs and start going after the jobs of the future. His narrowness of vision is killing us.\n\nOrlando Delogu of Portland is emeritus professor of law at the University of Maine School of Law and a longtime public policy consultant to federal, state, and local government agencies and officials.
