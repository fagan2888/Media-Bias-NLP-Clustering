John Buckner was remembered Friday as a softspoken lawmaker whose work as a high school principal overshadowed his career in politics.\n\nBuckner died Thursday after a brief illness that complicated a respiratory condition. He was 67.\n\nServices had not yet been scheduled for the Aurora Democrat.\n\nTributes poured in Friday, from Gov. John Hickenlooper to House Speaker Dickey Lee Hullinghorst of Boulder, but the most powerful testimonials came from the hundreds of students he mentored over the years.\n\nSabrina D\u2019Agosta, the spokeswoman for the state Department of Personnel and Administration, graduated from Overland High School in Aurora.\n\n\u201cMy mom always tells the story of me going into a meeting with him to talk about the fact that I was headed to truancy court and came out with a plan to graduate from high school a year early,\u201d D\u2019Agosta wrote on her Facebook page. \u201cI am so grateful that I was able to work with him at the state, so he could see that I did something with the opportunity he gave me. I know I\u2019m only one of hundreds, but he made all the difference in my life.\u201d\n\nAfter Buckner retired, Overland High in 2008 renamed the gym in his honor.\n\n\u201cJohn Buckner was an invariably kind man, with a gentle sense of humor that brought people closer, never pushed them away,\u201d Hickenlooper said. \u201cHe brought that same spirit of inclusiveness to his work as an educator and a legislator in his mission to ensure that all Colorado children have access to the best education possible.\u201d\n\nBuckner\u2019s most significant piece of legislation reduced testing of Colorado schoolchildren. He co-sponsored the bill with Republican Rep. Jim Wilson of Salida.\n\nEach man put in about 40 years in education before being elected to the House in 2012.\n\n\u201cWe got the ball rolling, and it turned into an avalanche,\u201d Wilson said of the long-sought testing compromise.\n\nBuckner\u2019s last activity on Twitter was May 20, when he tweeted the news that Hickenlooper had signed his testing bill into law.\n\n\u201cHe believed passionately in education, and he believed it would give the kids he cared about their best opportunity to succeed,\u201d said Hullinghorst, who had appointed Buckner to chair the House Education Committee.\n\nIn 1975, Buckner went to work for the Cherry Creek School District as an assistant principal at Laredo Middle School. He then was an assistant principal at Smoky Hill High and at Prairie Middle School before becoming principal at Overland High in 1988.\n\nThe current Overland principal, Leon Lundie, recalled how Buckner invited Overland\u2019s boys basketball team to the Capitol to be recognized by the legislature after winning the state championship in March.\n\n\u201cOverland was not just a job for John \u2014 it was his home,\u201d Lundie said.\n\nA Democratic vacancy committee in Buckner\u2019s House District 40 will name a replacement to serve the rest of his term until next year\u2019s House election.\n\nBuckner is survived by his wife, Janet; twin daughters, Joy and Jennifer; a son, Jay; and three grandchildren.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe my life partner isn\u2019t going to be here, but he got a lot done,\u201d Janet Buckner said. \u201cHe was fair, and he was a straight shooter.\u201d\n\nJoey Bunch: 303-954-1174, jbunch@denverpost.com or twitter.com/joeybunch", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Aurora\u2019s John Buckner remembered as an educator, legislator", "title": "Aurora\u2019s John Buckner remembered as an educator, legislator", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/05/29/auroras-john-buckner-remembered-as-an-educator-legislator/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150529__john-bucknerp1-2.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150529__john-bucknerp1-2.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-29T14:50:31+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-24T08:25:08+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb40d\"", "article_summary": "State Rep.
