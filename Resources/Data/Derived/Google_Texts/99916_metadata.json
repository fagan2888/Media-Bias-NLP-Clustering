The FDA\u2019s announcement comes less than a month after an inspection of the company\u2019s plant in Punjab revealed possible violations in manufacturing practices.\n\n\u201cWe are taking swift action to prevent substandard quality products from reaching U.S. consumers,\u201d Carol Bennett, acting director of the Office of Compliance in the FDA\u2019s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research said in a statement. \u201cThe FDA is committed to ensuring that the drugs American consumers receive \u2014 no matter where they are produced \u2014 meet quality standards and are safe and effective.\u201d\n\nAn inspection of Ranbaxy\u2019s facility in Toansa revealed significant violations of the current good manufacturing practice (CGMP). On Jan. 11, 2014, the FDA concluded that staff at the company\u2019s Toansa facility was guilty of retesting raw materials and intermediate drug products but also of finishing API that had previously failed analytical testing and specifications. This is far from the first run in with the FDA Ranbaxy has experienced.\n\nThis past September, the FDA issued an import alert on Ranbaxy\u2019s facility in Mohali, India, after \u201cinspections identified significant CGMP violations.\u201d Under the FDA\u2019s import alert, any drug products manufactured by the company can be detained at the U.S. border. Violations discovered over the course of the FDA\u2019s inspection in September and December of 2012 included failure to investigate manufacturing problems and failure to ensure manufacturing quality procedures.\n\n\u201cThe FDA is committed to using the full extent of its enforcement authority to ensure that drugs made for the U.S. market meet federally mandated quality standards,\u201d Howard Sklamberg, director of the Office of Compliance in the FDA\u2019s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research said via a press release back in September. \u201cWe want American consumers to be confident that the drugs they are taking are of the highest quality, and the FDA will continue to work to prevent potentially unsafe products from entering the country.\u201d\n\nDrugs from Ranbaxy Laboratories\u2019 facility in Toansa will continue to be banned from crossing U.S. borders until the company complies with the current food manufacturing practices (CGMP). The Toansa facility must also be thoroughly inspected by a third-part expert that certifies to the FDA, the facility, as well as its methods and controls, are aligned with CGMP. The FDA has also advised any patients prescribed a drug manufactured by Ranbaxy to continue taking their medication until they are told otherwise by their physician.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "ranbaxy, laboratories, fda, drugs", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "The FDA has banned Ranbaxy Laboratories in Toansa, India, from manufacturing drugs for sale in the U.S. due to possible violations in manufacturing practices.", "title": "FDA Prohibits Ranbaxy Labs From Distributing Drugs", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/fda-prohibits-ranbaxy-labs-distributing-drugs-us-after-standard-manufacturing-practices-violation", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/01/23/ranbaxy-laboratories-ltd.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The FDA has banned Ranbaxy Laboratories in Toansa, India, from manufacturing drugs for sale in the U.S. due to possible violations in manufacturing practices.", "title": "FDA Prohibits Ranbaxy Labs From Distributing Drugs", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/fda-prohibits-ranbaxy-labs-distributing-drugs-us-after-standard-manufacturing-practices-violation", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/01/23/ranbaxy-laboratories-ltd.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/01/23/ranbaxy-laboratories-ltd.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Drugs", "published_time": "2014-01-23T17:16:25-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-01-23T18:16:09-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "The FDA has banned Ranbaxy Laboratories in Toansa, India, from manufacturing drugs for sale in the U.S. due to possible violations in manufacturing practices."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe009c\"", "article_summary": "This is far from the first run in with the FDA Ranbaxy has experienced.\nThe FDA\u2019s announcement comes less than a month after an inspection of the company\u2019s plant in Punjab revealed possible violations in manufacturing practices.\nThe Toansa facility must also be thoroughly inspected by a third-part expert that certifies to the FDA, the facility, as well as its methods and controls, are aligned with CGMP.\nViolations discovered over the course of the FDA\u2019s inspection in September and December of 2012 included failure to investigate manufacturing problems and failure to ensure manufacturing quality procedures.\nThe FDA has also advised any patients prescribed a drug manufactured by Ranbaxy to continue taking their medication until they are told otherwise by their physician."}
