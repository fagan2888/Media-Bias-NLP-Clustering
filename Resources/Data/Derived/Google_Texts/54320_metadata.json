The President already said he will be nominating someone, but will the Senate take up the question while he is still in office? We have the answer from several presidential candidates already and one of them is Jeb Bush. It\u2019s really not that important to him.\n\nJEB BUSH: I think President Obama is going to submit a nominee and in all likelihood this person will be out of the mainstream and he\u2019ll be rejected by the Senate. That\u2019s his prerogative. He has every right to do it, and the Senate has every right not to confirm that person. That\u2019s what I said. He clearly has the power to do it, but given his choice of Supreme Court justices in the past the Senate of the United States should not confirm someone whose out of the mainstream. DANA BASH: But if I could just clarify, right now it sounds as though\u2026 JEB BUSH: Yeah. DANA BASH: \u2026the Republicans who run the Senate aren\u2019t even going to schedule a vote. You think that one should be scheduled? JEB BUSH: It\u2019s up to Mitch McConnell. That\u2019s really not important to me.\n\nThat was a rather telling moment, particularly given that he\u2019s had a full night to think it over. The question is actually going to be of extreme interest to everyone voting in the GOP primary if I\u2019m any judge of things. There were multiple discussions on the logistics of failing to vote on a nominee as well as the political fallout going on this morning. Jake Tapper, responding to our colleague Hugh Hewitt, offered one observation as to how Republican Senators and GOP candidates for those offices would be impacted.\n\n.@hughhewitt: GOP senators in blue states may lose reelection opposing Obama push for SC nominee but if they join Dems they will def lose \u2014 Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) February 14, 2016\n\nThere were multiple people hitting Hugh on how the Senate was \u201cobligated\u201d to bring the nominee up for a vote. Hugh, himself a professor of constitutional law, was having none of it.\n\nPreisdent can nominate. Senate chooses whether to confirm. That's it. That's the Constitution. Read it. https://t.co/XGTMguDBfR \u2014 Hugh Hewitt (@hughhewitt) February 14, 2016\n\nHugh was on the Sunday morning roundup going into even more detail. (Daily Caller, with video at the link)\n\n\u201cIf I were a Republican \u2014 whether the Majority Leader all the way down to the county clerk \u2014 and every nominee I would say no hearings. No votes. Lame ducks don\u2019t make lifetime appointments.\u201d \u201cThere is no precedent,\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd I will simply add, the base will not forgive anyone. Senators will lose their jobs if they block the blockade. There should be an absolute blockade on this.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s going to be a common sentiment in Republican circles, but I\u2019m not at the point where I\u2019m ready to call it a done deal. First of all, the Democrats and their allies in the media will be pouring on the heat in nearly unprecedented fashion to force a vote. In order for the \u201cblockade\u201d Hewitt references to hold, both Chuck Grassley and Mitch McConnell will have to maintain stiff spines for nearly a solid year. Now let\u2019s say they both caved and it came to a floor vote. Look over the list of members for a moment and tell me if you don\u2019t think the Democrats could come up with roughly a baker\u2019s dozen Republicans who would vote to confirm an Obama nominee. But then again, I suppose I\u2019m just a bitter old skeptic.\n\nOn the matter of the rules, the Constitution is absolutely clear on this one, though some Democrats suddenly seem to have trouble reading the text. The President is entitled to nominate a replacement justice as soon as he likes and nobody can legally stop him. Then, in their advise and consent role, the Senate will take up the question. There is no time limit mentioned in the Constitution as to how long that might take. Under current Senate rules the nomination must first make it out of Chuck Grassley\u2019s committee and then Mitch McConnell would need to schedule it for a vote before that takes place. And if it takes a long time to get that done, the only people who the Senators answer to are the ones who elect them.\n\nSorry, Democrats, but that\u2019s pretty much the end of the story.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "I think it matters quite a bit to the people you\u2019d like to win over, though", "title": "Jeb: It\u2019s \u201cnot important to me\u201d whether there\u2019s a vote on Obama\u2019s SCOTUS nominee", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2016/02/14/jeb-its-not-important-to-me-whether-theres-a-vote-on-obamas-scotus-nominee/", "image": "http://media.hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/JebShrug.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@JazzShaw"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2016-02-14T17:31:57+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-14T21:10:09+00:00"}, "keywords": "Antonin Scalia, appointment, CNN, confirmation, dana bash, GOP Debate, Jeb Bush, nomination, State of the Union, Supreme Court,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "article_summary": "There were multiple discussions on the logistics of failing to vote on a nominee as well as the political fallout going on this morning.\nDANA BASH: \u2026the Republicans who run the Senate aren\u2019t even going to schedule a vote.\nHe has every right to do it, and the Senate has every right not to confirm that person.\nThe President already said he will be nominating someone, but will the Senate take up the question while he is still in office?\nThe question is actually going to be of extreme interest to everyone voting in the GOP primary if I\u2019m any judge of things."}
