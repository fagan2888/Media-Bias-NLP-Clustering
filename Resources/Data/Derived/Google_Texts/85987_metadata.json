A new study by Bryan Dettrey and Harvey D. Palmer suggests one way to test this question \u2014 by examining how economic growth differs under Republican and Democratic presidencies. Their finding might not be too surprising: Under Republicans, growth boosts the stock market, while under Democrats, it reduces unemployment.\n\nThe two academics examine how economic growth is distributed over time. Their data are expansive, covering the 60-year period from January 1951 to December 2010. They find that once economic growth increases above 1 percent a year \u2014 and it does so over most of the period they studied \u2014 \u201cthe average level of unemployment is significantly higher under Republican administrations.\u201d\n\nAs the above charts (from their paper) show, with either a one- or two-year lag, Democrats reduce unemployment dramatically during periods of GDP growth compared to Republicans. Some of this effect has to do with inflation rates (as a I note below), but the authors note another key difference: They argue that Republican policies (for instance, massive tax cuts for the rich and cuts to capital gains) incentivize corporations to use money to compensate CEOs or distribute to shareholders, rather than invest in workers and jobs.\n\nDettrey and Palmer are not the first academics to raise these points. In a 2004 paper, Larry Bartels showed that \u201cDemocratic presidents have produced slightly more income growth for poor families than for rich families.\u201d He updated that analysis earlier this year and found the same result. One reason he cites is the minimum wage: Its real value increased 16 cents a year under Democrats, but decreased by 6 cents a year under Republicans. A seminal study by Douglas Hibbs found that \u201cthe unemployment rate was driven downward by Democratic and Labor administrations and upward by Republican and Conservative governments.\u201d In another study, Alan Blinder and Mark Watson found that the economy grows faster under Democrats, but couldn\u2019t determine why. It could be that the safety net boosts entrepreneurship by making Americans feel more economically secure (and willing to take risks).\n\nThere is also an increasingly large body of research on differing government policies at the state level. Christopher Witko and Nathan Kelly note that \u201csince the Republican takeover of Congress in 1995, the states have played a more important role in shaping the income distribution,\u201d and, consequently, in driving income inequality. In another paper, Elizabeth Rigby and Megan Hatch identify three major policies that states can pursue to slow the income growth of the 1 percent. In particular, they find that \u201cpolicies played a significant role in shaping income inequality in the states.\u201d If states had adopted more liberal policies, Rigby and Hatch suggest, the increase in inequality (as measured by the Gini Coefficient) would have been 60 percent smaller \u2014 and the share going to the top 1 percent would have been halved.\n\n(Story continues below the chart.)\n\nOverall, Hatch and Rigby find that conservative policies tend to exacerbate inequality, while liberal policies tend to reduce it. Rigby tells me that the \u201cmore redistribution\u201d scenario can be considered the \u201cliberal\u201d scenario, and \u201cless redistribution\u201d the \u201cconservative\u201d scenario, although Democrats don\u2019t always line up perfectly behind liberal policies. Kelly and Witko concur: \u201cWe observe that when unions are stronger and left party governments are in power at either the federal or state level we see lower levels of inequality.\u201d Numerous other studies surveyed by Anne Case and Timothy Besley suggest that Democrats boost government spending, particularly on workers\u2019 compensation and Medicaid (see pages 44 and 45).", "article_metadata": {"description": "When Dems control the White House, the middle class wins.
