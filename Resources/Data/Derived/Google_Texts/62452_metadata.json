President Barack Obama submitted the new agreement to lawmakers April 21 for a period of review lasting 90 days when Congress is in session. If unopposed by legislation, the agreement goes into force.\n\nFrank Klotz, under secretary for nuclear security at the Department of Energy, said the agreement will \u201cenhance our ability to manage and mitigate the risk of China diverting sensitive nuclear technology to its military programs or re-exporting it without U.S. permission.\u201d\n\nRepublicans and Democrats acknowledged economic benefits for the U.S. nuclear industry from cooperation with China, but voiced wide-ranging concerns over Beijing\u2019s sticking to its international obligations.\n\nRepublican committee chairman Sen. Bob Corker said China has committed not to assist any country in the development of ballistic missiles that can be used to deliver nuclear weapons. But he added, \u201cconcerns persist about Chinese willingness and ability to detect and prevent illicit transfers.\u201d\n\nTop-ranking Democrat Sen. Ben Cardin said multiple State Department reports document that Chinese companies and individuals continue to export dual-use goods relevant to nuclear and chemical weapons and ballistic missile programs in Iran and North Korea.\n\n\u201cTo me, this agreement presents us with a golden opportunity to place pressure on China to halt these dangerous activities,\u201d Cardin said.\n\nThe original agreement signed in 1985 was delayed for 13 years because of questions over China\u2019s proliferation to countries including Pakistan.\n\nSince then, China has entered various international accords, including the Non-Proliferation Treaty, and has joined the Nuclear Suppliers Group. But it has decided to build more power reactors in Pakistan, although its facilities are not under international safeguards.\n\nCountryman, who heads the State Department\u2019s bureau of international security and nonproliferation, acknowledged that was inconsistent with China\u2019s commitment as a Nuclear Suppliers Group member.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Edward Markey voiced the strongest opposition to the new agreement.\n\nHe said China has failed to take enforcement action against Li Fangwei, also known as Karl Lee, a Chinese man who has been indicted in the U.S. for allegedly contributing to Iran\u2019s ballistic missile program and making millions of dollars in illegal financial transactions to avoid economic sanctions.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite clear that there are entities within China who continue to sell materials that could have dual use application into this international nuclear weapon and ballistic missile marketplace in the same way A.Q. Khan was doing it out of Pakistan,\u201d Markey said.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s preposterous to conclude that the Chinese government is incapable of shutting this down,\u201d he said.\n\nKhan is a Pakistani scientist who operated an illicit network that sold nuclear weapons technology to countries such as Iran, North Korea and Libya.\n\nCorker said the committee faces a \u201cdifficult task\u201d in reviewing the China agreement. He said if the economic benefits of the agreement outweigh the concerns, it should be approved without delay. If not, and the concerns can\u2019t be mitigated, he said the agreement should not be approved.\n\nCountryman said it would be \u201cdevastating\u201d to the U.S. nuclear industry to lose access to China\u2019s fast-growing nuclear energy program, where a third of the world\u2019s atomic power plants currently under construction are located.\n\nU.S.-headquartered company Westinghouse is constructing four reactors in China, under a deal reached in 2005, and six more are planned, which it values at $25 billion.\n\nCountryman said that ending cooperation would allow suppliers from Russia and France to gain a greater foothold in the Chinese market. It would also \u201ccreate new difficulties\u201d in the administration\u2019s efforts to manage the complex U.S.-China relationship, he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Obama administration on Tuesday urged senators to support a new 30-year agreement with China on civilian nuclear cooperation but faced a barrage of concern from both parties that Chinese companies are exporting sensitive technology to Iran and North Korea.", "Author": "MATTHEW PENNINGTON", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/may/12/obama-admin-urges-approval-of-new-us-china-nuke-ag/", "type": "article", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The Obama administration on Tuesday urged senators to support a new 30-year agreement with China on civilian nuclear cooperation but faced a barrage of concern from both parties that Chinese companies are exporting sensitive technology to Iran and North Korea.", "title": "Obama administration urges approval of US-China nuclear pact"}, "twitter": {"title": "Obama administration urges approval of US-China nuclear pact", "description": "The Obama administration on Tuesday urged senators to support a new 30-year agreement with China on civilian nuclear cooperation but faced a barrage of concern from both parties that Chinese companies", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d"}, "article_summary": "Khan is a Pakistani scientist who operated an illicit network that sold nuclear weapons technology to countries such as Iran, North Korea and Libya.\nCorker said the committee faces a \u201cdifficult task\u201d in reviewing the China agreement.\nSince then, China has entered various international accords, including the Non-Proliferation Treaty, and has joined the Nuclear Suppliers Group.\nRepublican committee chairman Sen.
