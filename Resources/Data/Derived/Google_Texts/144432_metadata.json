Since July 7, the Federal Trade Commission has been reviewing a plea by the group to create what the petition calls a \u201cbasic privacy tool\u201d to be used to challenge continued display on websites of personal information that is considered damaging or hurtful.\n\nWE CHECKED THE CONSTITUTION, AND\u2026\n\nAmerica\u2019s Constitution was not quite a decade old when Congress began experimenting with the idea that some ideas are too dangerous to be allowed to be written or even heard about by the people. The Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798 treated public criticism of the government and its leaders as a form of \u201cseditious libel\u201d that would be \u2013 and, in fact, was \u2014 severely punished.\n\nFrom the day that President John Adams signed those Acts into law, they drew severe criticism, especially from Thomas Jefferson\u2019s followers. They were a rallying cry, for example, among the German farmers in eastern Pennsylvania who staged \u201cFriese\u2019s rebellion\u201d \u2013 the last of the three citizen uprisings that threatened the stability of the new Republic but also created a lasting tradition of dissent from the government\u2019s over-use of its powers.\n\nThe constitutionality of the four measures was never tested in the Supreme Court, but it has long been assumed that they violated the First Amendment\u2019s guarantee of free expression. Indeed, the Supreme Court strongly hinted at their invalidity in the 1964 decision in New York Times v. Sullivan, putting strong new limits on the enactment of laws to punish for libel or slander.\n\nWith the growth of the mass media in the 19th Century, and especially with the arrival of sensationalist journalism as a way to sell more newspapers, the instinct to turn to the government for protection from public expression took a new form, the plea for a \u201cright to be let alone,\u201d to be enforced \u2013 naturally \u2013 by the institutions of government.\n\nThat idea got its fullest early exploration in a Harvard Law Review article in 1890, titled \u201cThe Right of Privacy.\u201d It was a response to what was then the new technology of mass media, and its fascination with intensely personal information about people. It ultimately gave rise to a host of privacy laws, designed to erect a governmentally policed barrier to invasion of people\u2019s private realms.\n\nAll of this history has come rushing back to the fore, with the rise of the Digital Age and with the enormous capacity of the Internet to expose the most intimate details of private lives \u2013 and, especially, its technological capacity to keep such details open to inquisitive computer users for years and years to come. Is there no way to scrub this intrusive detail from digital platforms? Not surprisingly, a new movement has formed, one that reaches again for a shield provided by the government against the profound loss of privacy, or the threat of such a loss. A new concept has been born (and already has taken legal shape in Europe): a \u201cright to be forgotten.\u201d\n\nIt has become obvious that traditional laws against invasion of privacy, or laws against libel and slander, have been found wanting against this perceived new cultural problem. And the size of the major private firms that tend to dominate the Internet \u2013 and especially, those that are the providers of the search engines that can call up this private information \u2013 has inhibited some who would advocate a right to scrub invasive websites.\n\nOne advocacy group, known as Consumer Watchdog, has not been inhibited, however. It has turned to a federal law that is designed to protect American consumers from unfair and deceptive business practices. That is Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, a law enforced by the agency of that name. The FTC, under that section, has the authority to police business practices that \u201ccause substantial injury to consumers,\u201d and that are beyond the power of consumers themselves to rectify.\n\nConsumer Watchdog, in its formal plea for action by the FTC, insisted that the creation of a \u201cright to be forgotten\u201d by that agency would not be censorship, because the FTC itself would not remove from the Internet any specific content to which a consumer objected. \u201cThe right,\u201d the group\u2019s petition said, \u201csimply allows a person to request that links from their name to data that is inadequate, irrelevant, no longer relevant, or excessive to be removed from search results.\u201d\n\nEven so, as an arm of the government, the FTC would have to provide some mechanism for enforcing such a right. And, in the process of doing so, it would have to provide official definitions of what would qualify as, for example, \u201cno longer relevant\u201d or \u201cexcessive.\u201d Those are not terms that define themselves, and the operators of search engines would clearly have a constitutional right (under the Due Process Clause as well as under the First Amendment) to be told \u2013 in advance \u2013 just what enforcement of such terms would entail.\n\nEurope, of course, is moving toward a regime that enforces a \u201cright to be forgotten.\u201d But European collective government is not restrained by a First Amendment in the way that the American government (including the FTC) is. Already, as could be expected, news organizations and other sentinels of First Amendment rights are objecting to a role for the FTC in defining and enforcing this new right.\n\nAlthough digital technology is now very highly developed, it is fair to say that the constitutional law of regulation of digital expression is still in its infancy, and is sure to experience growing pains. A \u201cright to be forgotten\u201d is thus not a sure thing.\n\nRecent Stories on Constitution Daily\n\nPodcast: Obamacare, Kim Davis, and religious exemptions\n\nSeparating fact from fiction about \u2018The Star-Spangled Banner\u2019\n\n10 fascinating facts about President and Chief Justice William Howard Taft\n\nShare:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Constitution Daily", "description": "Lyle Denniston, the National Constitution Center\u2019s constitutional literacy adviser, looks at the First Amendment and the desire of some people to force Internet companies to delete unflattering or ...", "title": "Constitution Check: Is there, or should there be, a right to be forgotten?", "url": "http://blog.constitutioncenter.org/2015/09/constitution-check-is-there-or-should-there-be-a-right-to-be-forgotten/", "image": "http://blog.constitutioncenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/BalticServers_data_center.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://blog.constitutioncenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/BalticServers_data_center.jpg?w=240", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "fb": {"admins": 59543893235, "page_id": 59543893235, "app_id": 108483985888821}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-15T10:38:18+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-15T10:38:18+00:00", "author": "http://blog.constitutioncenter.org/author/lyle-denniston/"}, "msvalidate.01": "7A707BA806870C4CB077BE8CFB94D00F", "google-site-verification": "g-YRZSJfme1Aa6j71jlmtj3ZRUHZKtKda1U7n-deAIA", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "A \u201cright to be forgotten\u201d is thus not a sure thing.\nEurope, of course, is moving toward a regime that enforces a \u201cright to be forgotten.\u201d But European collective government is not restrained by a First Amendment in the way that the American government (including the FTC) is.\nIt ultimately gave rise to a host of privacy laws, designed to erect a governmentally policed barrier to invasion of people\u2019s private realms.\nShare:EmailLyle Denniston, the National Constitution Center\u2019s constitutional literacy adviser, looks at the First Amendment and the desire of some people to force Internet companies to delete unflattering or personal information from websites.\nAlready, as could be expected, news organizations and other sentinels of First Amendment rights are objecting to a role for the FTC in defining and enforcing this new right."}
