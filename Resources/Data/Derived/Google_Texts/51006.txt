Rams erase 18-point deficit to beat UNLV

FORT COLLINS — There's no doubting UNLV's talent. Nine NBA scouts don't show up to every game at Moby Arena.

And the Runnin' Rebels' next-level ability was on full display early in the first half Saturday, sprinting out to an 18-point lead just 8 minutes in with a series of transition dunks and easy buckets.

The Rebels literally couldn't miss, making nine straight shots at one point. As daunting as the 18-point deficit was for the Rams, it seemed even worse. Even CSU senior guard Daniel Bejarano thought so, saying afterward that his team was down "27 or whatever it was."

Wednesday's loss at Wyoming, when the Rams had their lowest-scoring game in three seasons under coach Larry Eustachy, seemed to be hanging around a bit too long.

Then the Rams flipped a switch. They started getting stops on one end and making shots on the other.

Momentum is a powerful force in sports. And in front of a crowd of 7,113 mostly dressed in orange for the team's annual homage to its agricultural heritage, the Rams (or Aggies) suddenly had big Mo' on their side.

CSU finished the first half on a 19-3 run to cut the deficit to two at the break (41-39), then continued its run in the second half to go up seven before holding on for a thrilling 83-82 victory.

Stanton Kidd led four Rams in double figures with 19 points and was 3 for 4 from the 3-point line, including a huge 3 from the corner to beat the first-half buzzer to send the Rams into the locker room riding high.

"We kept fighting and (got) stops. In the last 12 minutes they had five points," Kidd said about what changed the game in the Rams' favor. "Coach said keep getting stops and the offense will come. Daniel drove, penetrated and could've took a shot of his own, but he found me. The rest is history. But other than that, defense caused that momentum swing for us to come out in the second half and take the lead and control the game a little bit."

CSU led for a majority of the second half, but found itself in a nail-biter at the end after Patrick McCaw banked in a 3 with 47 seconds left to make it a one-point game following three free throws by Gian Clavell that had given CSU a two-possession lead.

After a video review gave UNLV possession with 9 seconds to following a miss by Bejarano, the Rebels had a chance to win. They got a great look, but Jordan Cornish's wide-open 3 rimmed out just before the final horn sounded.

"It was a great feeling," said CSU senior forward J.J. Avila, who had 15 points, 11 rebounds, seven assists and three steals. "Crazy win. They're a great team, very talented."

CSU survived what would've been a crushing blow to its hopes for an at-large bid to the NCAA Tournament. UNLV freshman guard Rashad Vaughn did all he could to deliver the Rams' their second straight loss, scoring 30 points, one shy his career high, on 12 of 21 shooting.

Sophomore Christian Wood, like Vaughn a legit pro prospect, also had 16 points, 11 rebounds and four blocks for the Rebels, who snapped a three-game win streak in falling to 13-10 and 4-6 in the Mountain West.

Meanwhile the Rams improved to 20-4 overall and 7-4 in the MW. It marked CSU's ninth 20-win season in program history, the second in the past three years under Eustachy.

"That game had everything, I thought, except for me getting a technical," Eustachy quipped. "That's the difference I think between the NBA and college basketball. At this time of year it's very exciting. So it was a great win.

"UNLV played well enough to win, they really did. But the last shot kind of indicated how the game went. So we were very fortunate, but I was really proud of our guys for them to respond after I would say a Wyoming hangover, would be my best bet. I don't know, but we started out extremely poor."

Bejarano finished with 18 points and nine rebounds for the Rams, who pulled off their biggest comeback of the season after erasing a 14-point hole against Boise State on New Year's Eve. Bejarano was clutch late, knocking down a pair of 3s with less than 3 minutes to go after McCaw had put the Rebels up three with 3:37 to go.

"I want the ball, as you saw at the end, and we needed the bucket," the senior guard said. "I was really feeling it after a couple of guys missed. J.J. got the rebound and he found me, and I had the confidence to knock it down."

Both teams shot above 45 percent from the field and better than 40 percent from 3, but the Rams were able to outscore the Rebels 42-30 in the paint and 19-12 in bench points thanks to 10 from Clavell and nine from John Gillon, who also had six assists and no turnovers in 26 minutes.

CSU looks to continue to add to its NCAA resume at home Tuesday against New Mexico, which dealt the Rams their first loss of the season back on Jan. 3.

"We just keep fighting. I didn't have a doubt in my mind we were going to lose that game," Kidd said. "I kept saying to myself, 'we're going to win, we're going to win, we're going to win. We just have to keep fighting, and that's what we did."
