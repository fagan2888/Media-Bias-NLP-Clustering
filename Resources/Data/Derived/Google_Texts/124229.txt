Authorities in northwest Mississippi say an officer is in critical condition after being shot in the head while investigating a robbery across the street from a police station.

Nursing supervisor Vivian Crawford said Sunday that Derrick Couch is in critical condition at Regional One Health in Memphis.

Mayor Bill Luckett tells WMC-TV that Cpl. Couch was found on the street outside a convenience store that had been robbed late Saturday by two masked men. The report said the store is across from a police station.

WREG-TV reports that police have released a video of two possible suspects, including one with a noticeable limp.
