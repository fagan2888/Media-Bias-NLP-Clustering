The facts do not support Rowan Moore\u2019s story.\n\nOne complaint every two years\n\nTower Hamlets Police have checked and then double checked for us and they have no record of any calls or complaints about the Wapping Project.\n\nTower Hamlets Council have received just six minor complaints during the last thirteen years and state these were resolved informally, or that no further action was taken because no statutory nuisance had been caused. That\u2019s an average of just one complaint every two years.\n\nRubbish collection times changed\n\nThe only complaint of the six which was made in 2013 and is recorded relates to disturbance caused by Tower Hamlets council refuse collection service. The issue was resolved by the council changing their hours of rubbish collection at the Wapping Project.\n\nWe\u2019ve spoken to many residents living near the Wapping Project and none have issues with noise disturbance. All were shocked and upset that local residents are being blamed for the Wapping Project\u2019s closure.\n\nPrior to news of the sale in the Observer, Wapping blogger Paul Kellaway had already made the Freedom of Information Act (FOI) requests to Tower Hamlets Council which revealed the details of the six minor noise complaints which have been made during the last thirteen years [view details].\n\nSo if the Wapping Project was not forced to close by local residents complaining about noise what could be the reason for the death of this much loved cultural space?\n\nThe simple explanation seems to be that Jules Wright, the owner of the Wapping Project, was simply tired of it and the amount of work it took to run.\n\nJules has said to a number of people that she wants to focus on her other activities, which include the Wapping Project Bankside, a commercial art gallery.\n\nThe fact is that the Wapping Project has not caused noise disturbance for local residents and Tower Hamlets Council did not threaten to close the Wapping Project down because of Nimby residents. Jules Wright wanted to sell and UK Real Estate wanted to buy it.\n\nThe new owner of the Wapping Project\n\nNick Capstick-Dale owns and runs UK Real Estate, but in contrast to most property developers he claims to have not sold a property since 1992. Seems like he falls in love with his properties and cannot bear to part with them [This is Money].\n\nNick has spent nearly four years painstakingly restoring Wapping\u2019s Metropolitan Wharf, just a stone\u2019s throw from the Wapping Project, to its former glory [view post].\n\nWe met Nick Capstick-Dale last week to get the facts about the Wapping Project purchase and find out what he intends to do with a Grade 2 listed old hydraulic power station site.\n\nAfter visiting the Wapping Project three years ago and loving the place, Nick asked to be notified if it was ever put up for sale.\n\nAround mid 2012 Jules Wright must have notified her agents that she wanted to sell as Nick got the call he was waiting for.\n\nThe initial asking price was too high, but after a few months Nick became aware of conversations taking place with other property developers and feared the Wapping Hydraulic Power Station would be ruined by a buyer unsympathetic to its history and heritage.\n\nNo blocks of flats, no fast food drive thru\n\nAs time passed, Nick decided that he couldn\u2019t bear for the Wapping Wall area of Wapping to be ruined, either by a fast food drive through or other horrid development on the Wapping Project site.\n\nSo in July 2013, the original asking price was negotiated down and the Wapping Project was sold for \u00a33.2m + VAT in what almost sounded like an impulse buy.\n\nVacant possession doesn\u2019t take place until the 23rd December 2013, so only then can architectural surveys of the industrial building, site and basement area be carried out to determine what is or isn\u2019t feasible.\n\nUntil then, firm plans for the future cannot be drawn up, but they will be shared locally as soon as there is something to share.\n\nBut Nick could describe his broad future vision for the future of the site. What about building some flats we asked?\n\n\u201cThere are no plans to construct blocks of flats, build or create residential properties on the site,\u201d said Nick with a look of horror when we asked about residential development.\n\n\u201cThe land and car park area around the Power Station building will be maintained, as it\u2019s a bit of a mess and then landscaped nicely.\u201d\n\nNo application for a change of use is planned, meaning future uses will be within the existing commercial uses already approved. These cover theatre, performance, exhibition, cultural, leisure and associated amenities as well as use of some space as a restaurant.\n\nSo while the Wapping Project begins to fade from people\u2019s memories, it seems highly likely something better is just around the corner for the Wapping Hydraulic Power Station.\n\n(1) Observer, Sunday 1 December [view article]\n\nBringing the Wapping Hydraulic Power Station back to life\n\nNick believes the future success of the old industrial site means bringing it back to life and making it appealing to a wide audience so that there are always people wanting to be there. It must provide something for everyone: residents, visitors, and local workers.\n\nLong term, the old power station site needs to cover its costs, but Nick does not have the one to two year pressure of maximising shareholder value that a listed property development company, answerable to a board and shareholders would. He doesn\u2019t need it to make a profit, just break even ultimately. He\u2019s in no rush.\n\nNick says he loves nice properties and has no plans to sell either Metropolitan Wharf or the Wapping Project. His track record to date would seem to bear this promise out.\n\nChatting to Nick, a regular visitor to our much loved local Italian restaurant, Il Bordello, it\u2019s impossible to doubt his enthusiasm about Wapping \u2013 he even jokes, that if he was single he\u2019d move here.\n\nIt\u2019s reassuring to see the evidence from UK Real Estate\u2019s other Wapping property investment, Metropolitan Wharf which has taken almost four years to beautifully restore and renovate, which we saw inside for ourselves last year [view post] and again last week.\n\nWhat\u2019s in Wapping\u2019s opinion on the Wapping Project sale\n\nWe object to Wapping residents being called \u201ccomplaining Nimbys\u201d and blamed for the closure of the Wapping Project because it\u2019s not true.\n\nTime will tell, but we think Wapping has nothing to fear from the sale of the Wapping Project to UK Real Estate Ltd and potentially, a lot to gain.\n\nWapping residents are just as upset as Rowan Moore about the closure of the Wapping Project, but luckily for E1W, the future is looking quite bright and nothing like the cultural desert he makes out it will become.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3729/11272502774_3d23588499_z.jpg"}, "robots": "index, nofollow", "generator": "Woo Framework Version 3.0.12"}, "article_summary": "What\u2019s in Wapping\u2019s opinion on the Wapping Project saleWe object to Wapping residents being called \u201ccomplaining Nimbys\u201d and blamed for the closure of the Wapping Project because it\u2019s not true.\nThe fact is that the Wapping Project has not caused noise disturbance for local residents and Tower Hamlets Council did not threaten to close the Wapping Project down because of Nimby residents.\nThe issue was resolved by the council changing their hours of rubbish collection at the Wapping Project.\nTime will tell, but we think Wapping has nothing to fear from the sale of the Wapping Project to UK Real Estate Ltd and potentially, a lot to gain.\nThe Wapping Project was sold on 19th July 2013 to UK Real Estate Ltd for \u00a33.2m + VAT and the arts space will close fully on 22nd December 2013."}
