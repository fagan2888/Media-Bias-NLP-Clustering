But thanks to the government shutdown, everyone is talking about the implosion of the GOP instead.\n\nThe shutdown drama has distracted from the fact that Obamacare\u2019s debut is worse than many realize \u2014 and it threatens the fundamental viability of the law itself. The administration claims the Obamacare online exchanges crashed because the Web site got more than 8 million hits in the first week. Please. You know how many people visit Amazon.com every week? More than 70 million. The difference is: 1.) Amazon seldom crashes, and 2.) on Amazon, people actually buy something.\n\nIt appears virtually no one is buying Obamacare. While administration officials brag about how many visitors the site is getting, they refuse to divulge how many people actually signed up. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius was asked that directly by Jon Stewart on \u201cThe Daily Show.\u201d \u201cFully enrolled?\u201d Sebelius stuttered. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you. Because I don\u2019t know.\u201d That is a frightening admission of incompetence. If the Obama administration can\u2019t even track how many people signed up, how on earth is it going to verify whether those people are eligible for subsidies? How will it protect against fraud?\n\nThe Post reported this past weekend that the failure of the Web site is worse than previously known: \u201cEven when consumers have been able to sign up, insurers sometimes can\u2019t tell who their new customers are because of a separate set of computer defects.\u201d It turns out that in some 99 percent of applications, the Obamacare site did not provide insurers with enough verifiable information to enroll people in their plans.\n\nComputer experts say the problems with the site are not because of heavy traffic but are the result of structural flaws in system architecture. It is going to take months to rebuild it. That raises a question: If the federal government can\u2019t manage a simple Web site, how on earth is it going to manage the health care of millions of Americans?\n\nIt also means that President Obama may have no choice but to delay the individual mandate. As my American Enterprise Institute colleague, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, points out, how can Obama penalize people for not having health insurance if the government\u2019s Web site to provide that insurance doesn\u2019t work?\n\nWithout the individual mandate, Obamacare unravels. The only way the law works is if the government forces young, healthy people into it by threatening them with penalties for not carrying health insurance. But if there is no penalty for not signing up, then fewer Americans will sign up.\n\nEven if the administration manages to fix the Web site and finally implement the individual mandate, people still may not join \u2014 because the plans being offered are so unattractive. To entice people to join the exchanges, the administration forced insurers to offer low monthly premiums and cover people with preexisting conditions. Insurers have responded by increasing deductibles \u2014 the out-of-pocket costs people must pay before insurance benefits kick in \u2014 to stratospheric levels.\n\nAccording to an analysis this weekend by the president\u2019s hometown paper, the Chicago Tribune, \u201c21 of the 22 lowest-priced plans offered on the Illinois health insurance exchange for Cook County have annual deductibles of more than $4,000 for an individual and $8,000 for family coverage. . . . Plans with the least expensive monthly premiums \u2014 highlighted by state and federal officials as proof the new law will keep costs low for consumers \u2014 have deductibles as high as $6,350 for individuals and $12,700 for families.\u201d Even with federal subsidies, few Americans will bother to buy insurance with a $4,000 to $12,700 deductible \u2014 and millions won\u2019t even be eligible for the subsidies.\n\nIf enough Americans don\u2019t join the exchanges, Obamacare collapses. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the administration needs at least 7 million people to join the exchanges for Obamacare to be financially viable. While the administration won\u2019t reveal sign-up rates, London\u2019s Daily Mail reported that total sign-ups in the first week were just 51,000 people. If accurate, that would mean they have just 6,949,000 more to go to break even.\n\nBottom line: It turns out Obamacare is blowing itself up just fine without Republican help. Far from a few \u201cglitches,\u201d the president\u2019s signature program is in free fall after only a week. But instead of focusing on the Obamacare debacle, the news is filled with stories about . . . the government shutdown. The irony is, the shutdown was intended to stop Obamacare. Instead, it is rescuing Obama from his own incompetence.\n\nRead more from Marc Thiessen\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.", "article_metadata": {"description": "It\u2019s worse than you think.", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/marcthiessen", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "It\u2019s worse than you think.", "title": "Marc Thiessen: The Obamacare implosion is worse than you think", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/marc-thiessen-the-obamacare-implosion-is-worse-than-you-think/2013/10/14/7efa4e74-34d7-11e3-be86-6aeaa439845b_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2013/10/14/Editorial-Opinion/Images/2013-10-02T173912Z_01_TOR101_RTRIDSP_3_USA-HEALTHCARE-TECHNOLOGY-1819.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@marcthiessen"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/marc-thiessen-the-obamacare-implosion-is-worse-than-you-think/2013/10/14/7efa4e74-34d7-11e3-be86-6aeaa439845b_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Marc Thiessen, obamacare, obamacare exchanges, obamacare website, obamcare debut, insurance exchanges, affordable care act website, affordable care act,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/marcthiessen"}, "eomportal-uuid": "7efa4e74-34d7-11e3-be86-6aeaa439845b", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "Marc Thiessen, obamacare, obamacare exchanges, obamacare website, obamcare debut, insurance exchanges, affordable care act website, affordable care act,"}, "article_summary": "The administration claims the Obamacare online exchanges crashed because the Web site got more than 8 million hits in the first week.\nThe only way the law works is if the government forces young, healthy people into it by threatening them with penalties for not carrying health insurance.\nIf the Obama administration can\u2019t even track how many people signed up, how on earth is it going to verify whether those people are eligible for subsidies?\nBut thanks to the government shutdown, everyone is talking about the implosion of the GOP instead.\nAccording to the Congressional Budget Office, the administration needs at least 7 million people to join the exchanges for Obamacare to be financially viable."}
