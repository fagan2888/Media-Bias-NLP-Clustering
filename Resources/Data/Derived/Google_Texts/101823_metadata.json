Charles Froelicher, former executive director of the Gates Foundation, died Oct. 17 at home in Denver. He was 89.\n\nAs the head of one of Colorado\u2019s leading philanthropic organizations, Froelicher helped to grow Gates from a $35 million endowment to a $110 million endowment. The robust growth allowed Gates, with Froelicher\u2019s influence, to distribute $50 million over 17 years, the time Froelicher was with the foundation, to various civic and community causes including the South Platte Greenway Foundation, Leadership Conferences at Keystone, the 10th Mountain Division Trails System, Outdoor Colorado, Evans Ranch and various Colorado schools.\n\nAfter retiring as executive of the foundation in 1992, Froelicher continued to serve as a board member.\n\nBorn on Dec. 9, 1924, in Philadelphia, Froelicher came to Denver in 1955 to be headmaster of Colorado Academy.\n\nHe is credited with transforming the academy \u201cfrom a declining military academy to a prestigious, successful, college preparatory school,\u201d according to a post on the academy\u2019s website by Mike Davis, the school\u2019s current headmaster. Froelicher served the academy from 1955 to 1975.\n\nDavis referred to Froelicher as a friend and mentor.\n\n\u201cOver the years, Chuck and I would talk about our respective outdoor adventures, our love of history and politics, and our vision of schools and education,\u201d Davis said. \u201cI will miss those conversations greatly.\u201d\n\nFroelicher was a principal founder of the Colorado Outward Bound School, a developer of Copper Mountain Ski Area and was named to the Governor\u2019s Task Force for Excellence in Education and Control Substance Abuse by Gov. Richard Lamm.\n\n\u201cAlthough we knew it was coming, his death still came as a shock to our family as we were all convinced he was invincible,\u201d said his grandchildren, Sarah Emery, Weaver Froelicher and Eric Froelicher, in a written statement announcing his death.\n\nA few weeks before his death, Froelicher, with the help of family, fished the Roaring Fork near Carbondale.\n\n\u201cHe caught two trout,\u201d said his son, Franz Froelicher. \u201cHe loved the art and science of fly fishing, loved to watch the flies hatch and currents play.\u201d\n\nA celebration of life will be held at 11 a.m. on Nov. 1 at the Newton Gymnasium, Colorado Academy, 3800 S. Pierce St., Denver.\n\nMemorial contributions may be made to the F. Charles Froelicher Fund for Colorado Academy, or to a charity of the donor\u2019s choice.\n\nKieran Nicholson: 303-954-1822 or knicholson@denverpost.com", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "F.
