For example, the sentence One time in class I ate some glue could become 1TiC!AsG.\u201d\n\nSomeday, computer innovators tell us, passwords may be replaced by optical recognition or a system that can detect each person\u2019s unique pattern of touch on the keyboard. Let\u2019s hope that happens sooner rather than later, but in the meantime, I\u2019m afraid, the bad guys have won. There is simply no way that we can keep in our heads the new and improved super-safe passwords that would provide immunity from identity thieves. The cognitive pathways by which people perceive, process, understand and remember words prevent us from being able to embrace such random strings of characters as \u201c1TiC!AsG.\u201d\n\nIn cartoons from the olden days, a character might spout an obscenity that would be censored andrendered as \u201c$#!!&$#&.\u201d The \u201cword\u201d thus denoted was considered unspeakable in polite society, but now we are expected to use exactly such gibberish-chains to enable some of our most important communication. Little wonder that we might feel like shouting \u201c$#!!&$#&.\u201d\n\nAs a professional wordsmith (English professor and writer), it saddens me that these \u201cwords\u201d we\u2019re supposed to \u201cpass\u201d when we log onto our email and bank accounts even remotely share the same categorical denomination as the words that actually embody value for humanity: Words like \u201cApril is the cruelest month\u201d or \u201cThe answer is blowin\u2019 in the wind.\u201d Today\u2019s passwords aren\u2019t words. I demand a new term for them.\n\nAccording to the Oxford English Dictionary \u2013 the archive of how words appear and evolve in English \u2013 \u201cpassword\u201d first surfaced in its current usage (\u201ca sequence of characters, known only to authorized persons, which must be keyed in to gain access to a particular computer, network, file, function, etc.\u201d) a half-century ago, at a 1965 meeting of the American Federation of Information Processing Societies.\n\nBut the idea of a password long predated the computer age: Its first recorded use, as \u201ca selected word or phrase securing admission, recognition, etc., when used by those to whom it is disclosed,\u201d dates to 1799. Sir Walter Scott used the term \u2013 \u201cGeorge shall . . . force the fellow to give him the pass-word\u201d \u2013 in a translation of Goethe\u2019s 1773 play \u201cG\u00f6tz von Berlichingen.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "These days we're adopting increasingly complex passwords to protect our information.
