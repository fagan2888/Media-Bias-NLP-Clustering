I look to be part of Obama\u2019s views on Vietnamese youths, and help get through to the president the concerns we face on our journey to drive the country forward.\u201d\n\nAs for 29-year-old Vu Nhat Tan, Obama\u2019s historic visit to Vietnam marks a new stage of development in the bilateral relationship.\n\nTan earned his master\u2019s degree in the U.S. after being admitted to the Fulbright Program, a flagship international educational exchange program sponsored by the U.S. government.\n\nThrilled about his invitation to attend Obama\u2019s event on Wednesday morning, Tan hoped to hear the president\u2019s valuable opinions on issues such as social businesses, community responsibility, and environmental protection among others, the values pursued by all YSEALI members.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that [Obama] has lost his appeal for people, especially young ones, as the end of his term is nearing. The way I see it, he is acknowledged by the people of his country for having brought about positive changes to American society, such as a reduced unemployment rate, a flourishing economy, and a healthcare plan [Obamacare] that has transformed the lives of many people for the better,\u201d Tan explained.\n\nTran Hoang Khanh Van, head of the International Relations Division at the Ho Chi Minh City chapter of the Ho Chi Minh Communist Youth Union, expressed her excitement and eagerness to see the president in the flesh.\n\n\u201cI want to see if his personality in real life matches the media\u2019s description of him,\u201d Van confessed.\n\nVan predicted from her own research that President Obama would be talking about solutions and cooperative measures to improve Vietnam\u2019s education this Wednesday morning.\n\n\u201cIf I were to ask Obama one question, it would be whether he is willing to use his connections and power to help one startup project by Vietnamese youths that contributes greatly to the community,\u201d Van said. \u201cI believe he will be spending much time after his retirement from presidency to assist young people\u2019s activities.\u201d\n\nSaying he had been spending much time preparing questions for the president, Dinh Hieu said he would ask Obama about his ideas on how to help \u201cjumpstart\u201d developing countries like Vietnam so that they can see quick and sustainable development at the same time as catching up with developed countries.\n\n\u201cI will also ask the president about how youths in the U.S. and other developed nations have contributed to their country\u2019s development,\u201d Hieu added.\n\nThese youths may well get their questions across to the U.S. president this Wednesday, as Obama has previously spent a lot of time taking questions from the crowd in earlier YSEALI meetings, including one in Malaysia last November, where the president focused on the role of youths in the development of a country and a region as a whole.\n\nPresident Obama will depart for Japan to attend the 2016 G7 Summit after speaking in Ho Chi Minh City this Wednesday, concluding his three-day visit to Vietnam.\n\nLike us on Facebook or follow us on Twitter to get the latest news about Vietnam!", "article_metadata": {"copyright": "Tuoi Tre Newspaper", "robots": "index, follow", "language": "en", "author": "Tuoi Tre Newspaper"}, "article_summary": "Van predicted from her own research that President Obama would be talking about solutions and cooperative measures to improve Vietnam\u2019s education this Wednesday morning.\nPresident Obama will depart for Japan to attend the 2016 G7 Summit after speaking in Ho Chi Minh City this Wednesday, concluding his three-day visit to Vietnam.\nAs President Obama continues his three-day Vietnam visit in the country\u2019s commercial hub of Ho Chi Minh City, young Vietnamese look forward to meeting the President on Wednesday morning and getting their various questions answered.\n\u201cIf I were to ask Obama one question, it would be whether he is willing to use his connections and power to help one startup project by Vietnamese youths that contributes greatly to the community,\u201d Van said.\nTran Hoang Khanh Van, head of the International Relations Division at the Ho Chi Minh City chapter of the Ho Chi Minh Communist Youth Union, expressed her excitement and eagerness to see the president in the flesh."}
