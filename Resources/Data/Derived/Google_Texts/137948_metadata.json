Through Alex was born in Edmonton, Alberta, and had played hockey throughout his childhood, he gave away most of his hockey gear when he moved to California in 1960. His Canadian accent \u2014 and memory \u2014 ever present at the ripe young age of 93, he remembered thinking, \u201cShoot, they don\u2019t play hockey in California. It\u2019s too hot, ya know?\u201d\n\nIt has a long storied tradition; it\u2019s about camaraderie, friendship. All this stuff outside of playing hockey itself too is really what people think of when they think of the Snoopy tournament.\n\nHe had no idea what he was getting himself into when he walked through the doors: no idea that a 40-year friendship was waiting in the wings \u2014 let alone with Charles \u2018Sparky\u2019 Schulz, the creator of the Peanuts comics and the man who built the rink. He had never heard of Schulz before.He could not have figured that in less than two years from that day, he\u2019d play in the first Snoopy\u2019s Senior World Hockey Tournament at the arena \u2014 it was then called the Senior Olympics Tournament.This July, the Snoopy tournament celebrates its 40th anniversary. In 1975, only about 20 teams attended, but this year, 68 different teams will be split into 17 divisions with ages ranging from 40-plus to 70-plus. Teams come from all over: from the Bay Area, across the United States from states like Michigan and New York, from each of the Canadian provinces, and even as far as Japan and Switzerland in some years.But that December day in 1973, when Alex and Richard Young walked in, there was a hockey game in progress. Alex started picking out players on the ice that seemed to be his age. He said to his son, \u201cHey, I play as good as that old man. Or that one there. Or that one.\u201d Monte Schulz, who was at the arena and overheard what Alex said, told him to ask his dad, Charles Schulz, about stepping foot on the ice.Charles said Alex could play for the last period. Just by chance, he had his stick, skates and gloves in his car, and he suited up in the arena\u2019s lobby. \u201cIt felt so good that the first chance that I got the puck,\u201d Young said, \u201cI circled the net and I went through the whole team and scored a goal.\u201dSchulz was impressed and invited him back. The two ended up playing on the same team at the Snoopy tournament until 1999, the summer before Schulz passed away. Young didn\u2019t quit hockey until he turned 80, and he\u2019s returns to Snoopy\u2019s Home Ice every Tuesday to run the clock and keep score at the recreational games. \u201cIt gives me an outlet to get out of my house,\u201d he said.Schulz, an avid hockey fan from Minnesota, built the Redwood Empire Ice Arena in 1969 as a gift to the Santa Rosa community. In 1975, he took over the Senior Olympics Tournament, which was based in Burbank, and moved it up to wine country; it was rebranded to include the influence of Schulz\u2019s comic in 1982, which was a huge draw for a lot of people, said Mike Kovanis, the arena\u2019s hockey coordinator.\u201cWhen people are at other tournaments or other rinks they say, \u2018I went to the Snoopy tournament.\u2019 And people instantly know what it is,\u201d Kovanis said. \u201cIt has a long storied tradition; it\u2019s about camaraderie, friendship. All this stuff outside of playing hockey itself too is really what people think of when they think of the Snoopy tournament.\u201d\n\nFor three Santa Rosa hockey players \u2014 Roland Thibault, 76, John H.K. Riley, 64, and Kenny Martin, 51 \u2014 the tournament is more than just about playing hockey, and the rink has become a centerpiece of their lives.\n\nThe three players, plus Alex Young and Charles Schulz himself, are endlessly connected by Snoopy\u2019s Home Ice. Thibault coached Riley at the arena in 1967 and 1968, and later, they both played for the Woodstock Flyers championship team in 2013. Riley\u2019s dad, John H.C. Riley, was Alex Young\u2019s defensive partner for years at the tournament.And Martin used to go to tournaments with Thibault when he was growing up. \u201cI was 20 and he was 45. The good ol\u2019 days,\u201d Martin noted. Now they play together on Tuesday nights at the arena.Thibault, who said he\u2019s probably the oldest guy still skating at the rink on Tuesday nights, was close with Charles Schulz before he passed away in 2000. Schulz even named a character in Peanuts after him \u2014 Thibault\u2019s slicked-back mullet-like haircut in the Snoopy comics even still resembles the real Thibault\u2019s hairstyle; the only thing that\u2019s different is that the real-life character\u2019s hair has faded to white over the years.For those local hockey players, as well as those around the country who have made the Snoopy tournament a part of their lives, aging has become something they\u2019ve looked forward to.\u201cIt made turning 40 easy, turning 50, turning 60,\u201d shrugged Riley, who has played hockey in Santa Rosa since moving from Canada in 1967. \u201cThe tournament\u2019s still going; I\u2019m still going to play hockey.\u201d\u201cGrowing up here, we start out as little kids watching the tournament and trading pins and getting hats,\u201d Martin said. \u201cBy the time you reach the pinnacle, you\u2019re 40 and you make it in. It\u2019s rewarding to be able to participate after watching it for so many years.\u201dFor Riley, the Snoopy tournament has always been in the family. Riley has been involved with the tournament since he was a kid, watching his father, John H.C. Riley, serve as the master of ceremonies of the event for 37 years \u2014 starting with the inaugural tourney in 1975 until the 2012 tourney, a month before his passing.While his dad worked late into the night, staying for the latest games that usually ended around 2 a.m., the younger Riley volunteered as an off-ice official.After one of the Tuesday night \u201csenior skates,\u201d all four men were gathered at the rinkside Warm Puppy Caf\u00e9. Ready to make his journey home, Alex Young rose from his chair and retrieved his walker \u2014 which paled in size to Young, whose hockey player build is still evident. Thibault shouted out, \u201cDrive carefully, Alex!\u201d Young replied, \u201cAt 93 years old, I don\u2019t drive like I did when I was 50 years old.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Peninsula Press", "description": "In July, the Snoopy\u2019s Senior World Hockey Tournament in Santa Rosa celebrates its 40th anniversary.", "title": "Seniors take the ice at Snoopy\u2019s Senior World Hockey Tournament", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://peninsulapress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2015-06-18-at-8.24.27-PM.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-07-27T14:50:11+00:00", "url": "http://peninsulapress.com/2015/07/07/snoopys-senior-hockey-tournament/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PeninsuPress", "section": "Culture", "tag": "sports", "published_time": "2015-07-07T13:38:42+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-27T14:50:11+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "In July, the Snoopy\u2019s Senior World Hockey Tournament in Santa Rosa celebrates its 40th anniversary.", "creator": "@jwallach12", "image": "http://peninsulapress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2015-06-18-at-8.24.27-PM.jpg", "title": "Seniors take the ice at Snoopy\u2019s Senior World Hockey Tournament", "site": "@PeninsuPress", "card": "summary"}, "generator": "WordPress 4.2.4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "All this stuff outside of playing hockey itself too is really what people think of when they think of the Snoopy tournament.\nAlex Young only happened upon the Redwood Empire Ice Arena when his son, Richard, insisted on going shopping in Santa Rosa back in 1973.\nThe three players, plus Alex Young and Charles Schulz himself, are endlessly connected by Snoopy\u2019s Home Ice.\nIt\u2019s rewarding to be able to participate after watching it for so many years.\u201dFor Riley, the Snoopy tournament has always been in the family.\nThibault shouted out, \u201cDrive carefully, Alex!\u201d Young replied, \u201cAt 93 years old, I don\u2019t drive like I did when I was 50 years old.\u201d"}
