Today, author of The Secrets of Happy Families Bruce Feiler tells Big Think a third of Americans don't regularly sit down to eat meals together; the U.S. actually ranks 33rd out of 35 countries in terms of having family meals together. This disconnect is one SoulPancake wanted to explore further in their recent (tear-jerking) video with The Mealtime Movement.\n\nAs a social experiment, SP invited three families to talk about how connected or disconnected they felt as a family, as well as what their hopes and dreams were for one another; parents were interviewed separately from children. Then, SP brought families back together to share a meal and surprised them with the footage they had recorded. It's clear how moved both parents and children are by what they're learning, from pleas to spend more time together to what parents want for their children beyond good grades.\n\n\"Cheers to an awesome day,\" one dad tells his two sons.\n\nIn a 2013 Harris Poll, nearly 80 percent of young people thought their \"parents were more concerned about achievement than about caring for others,\" while more than two-thirds of teens in America wanted to have more time with their parents. Bolstering this connection can lead to greater health outcomes: Separate studies have shown a strong family connection helps children better navigate socially stressful situations, poor self-esteem, and anxiety.\n\nSo what do you do if you're just too busy? Feiler says to consider time-shifting, where your family meal is actually breakfast or snack time. Even just one weekend meal can be beneficial, he said.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "regular, family, meals, can, help, bring, children, and, their, parents, closer, together", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "SoulPancake and The Mealtime Movement team up to show how sharing meals can increase connection.", "title": "The Simple Way To Reconnect With Family", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/regular-family-meals-can-help-bring-children-and-their-parents-closer-together-361644", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/11/14/family-meals.JPG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "SoulPancake and The Mealtime Movement team up to show how sharing meals can increase connection.", "title": "The Simple Way To Reconnect With Family", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/regular-family-meals-can-help-bring-children-and-their-parents-closer-together-361644", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/11/14/family-meals.JPG", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/11/14/family-meals.JPG"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Vitality", "published_time": "2015-11-14T17:43:50-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-14T17:58:40-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "SoulPancake and The Mealtime Movement team up to show how sharing meals can increase connection."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddc35\"", "article_summary": "Feiler says to consider time-shifting, where your family meal is actually breakfast or snack time.\nIt's clear how moved both parents and children are by what they're learning, from pleas to spend more time together to what parents want for their children beyond good grades.\nThen, SP brought families back together to share a meal and surprised them with the footage they had recorded.\nBolstering this connection can lead to greater health outcomes: Separate studies have shown a strong family connection helps children better navigate socially stressful situations, poor self-esteem, and anxiety.\nToday, author of The Secrets of Happy Families Bruce Feiler tells Big Think a third of Americans don't regularly sit down to eat meals together; the U.S. actually ranks 33rd out of 35 countries in terms of having family meals together."}
