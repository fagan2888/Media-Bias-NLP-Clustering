Now, Cruz has another target: gluten-free food.\n\nWhile making a stump speech in South Carolina Tuesday, the Texas senator railed against what he called a culture of political correctness in the U.S. military.\n\nCruz told supporters military leaders shouldn\u2019t have to worry about poor reviews from \"some plush-bottomed Pentagon bureaucrat for political correctness or social experiments \u2014 or providing gluten-free MREs.\"\n\nAn MRE, or Meal, Ready-to-Eat, is prepackaged food that soldiers consume in the field. But those gluten-free ones that Cruz is so worried about aren\u2019t really a problem.\n\nCeliac disease, or any other gluten intolerance, is already enough to disqualify someone from military service, so there\u2019s no need to make those particular MREs at all. Unfortunately, one soldier found that out the hard way.\n\nIn December, former U.S. Army Installation Management Command soldier of the year Kevin Mulloy was told he could no longer participate in an ROTC program when it was discovered that he has celiac disease.\n\nMulloy said he can manage the condition and is physically ready for service. He said he hopes the Army \"will re-evaluate and make a different decision.\"\n\nCeliac disease affects up to 1 percent of Americans and intolerance to wheat, which contains gluten, is one of the most common food allergies in America.\n\nCruz's stance on starches is a bit ironic since he was talking about the country's need to build up its military. By allowing gluten-free food, millions more Americans would be eligible to join the forces.\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this story said Mulloy\u2019s celiac disease disqualified him from Army service; he was actually sidelined from an ROTC program. This video has been updated.\n\nThis video includes images from Getty Images, U.S. Army and U.S. Marine Corps and clips from KTRK and Ted Cruz.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ted Cruz said he doesn't want the military worrying about providing gluten-free food options to men and women in the service.", "og": {"site_name": "Newsy", "description": "Ted Cruz said he doesn't want the military worrying about providing gluten-free food options to men and women in the service.", "title": "If Elected, Ted Cruz Won't Provide Gluten-Free Meals For The Military", "url": "http://www.newsy.com/videos/if-elected-ted-cruz-won-t-provide-gluten-free-meals-for-the-military/", "image": "http://newsymain.npgroup.netdna-cdn.com/images/videos/m/1455679725.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Ted Cruz said he doesn't want the military worrying about providing gluten-free food options to men and women in the service.", "title": "If Elected, Ted Cruz Won't Provide Gluten-Free Meals For The Military", "url": "https://www.newsy.com/videos/if-elected-ted-cruz-won-t-provide-gluten-free-meals-for-the-military/", "image": "https://newsymain-npgroup.netdna-ssl.com/images/videos/m/1455679725.jpg", "site": "@newsyvideos", "player": {"width": 400, "identifier": "https://player.ooyala.com/tframe.html?embedCode=JzZzAxMTE6TxwWjIHNt_8t_4h658C_nI&pbid=54ea1c2f14ee44369ddf31ac887ffe7e", "height": 225}, "app": {"url": {"ipad": "newsy://57193", "iphone": "newsy://57193", "googleplay": "com.newsy"}, "name": {"ipad": "Newsy: Video News", "iphone": "Newsy: Video News", "googleplay": "Newsy: Multisource Video News"}, "id": {"ipad": 330879884, "iphone": 330879884, "googleplay": "com.newsy"}}, "card": "player"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "newsy://57193", "app_store_id": 330879884, "app_name": "Newsy: Video News"}}, "msvalidate.01": "675C8D40A5F1E0722AA2D3A33379E884", "fb": {"app_id": 380870506022, "pages": 49978948774}, "google-site-verification": "o36fft0HATmhbZ_GPX4YSOS3EmkTGkPrvNFxQwzcNbY", "keywords": "ted cruz,celiac disease,celiac's disease,gluten-free,gluten intolerance,food allergy,food allergies,2016 presidential election,2016 republican nomination,south carolina republican primary,wheat allergies,mre,meal ready to eat,united states of america,u.s. army,u.s. marine corps,politics,political news,newsy,newsy videos", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/newsyvideos"}, "thumbnail": "http://newsymain.npgroup.netdna-cdn.com/images/videos/m/1455679725.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "Ted Cruz said he doesn't want the military worrying about providing gluten-free food options to men and women in the service.\nTed Cruz has defined his campaign in opposition to Obamacare, abortion and amnesty for immigrants.\nThis video includes images from Getty Images, U.S. Army and U.S. Marine Corps and clips from KTRK and Ted Cruz.\nBy allowing gluten-free food, millions more Americans would be eligible to join the forces.\nNow, Cruz has another target: gluten-free food."}
