It contains \u201cwage and income\u201d data, according to its cover page, from 2010-12 of a Simi Valley man whose sensitive data was seemingly exposed without his knowledge.\n\n\u201cThis communication is intended for the sole use of the individual to whom it is addressed and may contain information that is privileged, confidential and exempt from disclosure under applicable law,\u201d a disclaimer on the cover page reads. \u201cIf the reader of this communication is not the intended recipient or the employee or the agent for delivering the communication to the intended recipient, you are hereby notified that any dissemination, distribution, or copying of this communication may be strictly prohibited.\u201d\n\nDerek Broes, a Seattle-based technology and media entrepreneur, learned of the errant fax from his cousin, who is married to the owner of TO Tire Supply. Broes said he was shocked to learn that IRS officials did not use a verified number to send the information, which he claims could easily be used to deplete the man\u2019s bank account and launch a new identity within minutes.\n\n\u201cThis information shouldn\u2019t be in anyone\u2019s hands but the person who owns the information,\u201d Broes told FoxNews.com. \u201cThere\u2019s a whole lot of stuff here to do a whole lot of destruction. His life could be destroyed. You don\u2019t handwrite this type of information, it has to be verified. It\u2019s pretty bad.\u201d\n\nBroes said he attempted to notify the IRS of the mistake, but never got to a live operator. Neither the CPA nor the Simi Valley man could be reached for comment.\n\nAs an entrepreneur who understands the cost of protecting employees\u2019 personal information, Broes said he was particularly concerned that small and large businesses are subjected to stringent regulations regarding the very type of information that was misdirected by federal employees.\n\n\u201cThe amount of money I would have to invest to make sure this doesn\u2019t happen \u2026 and that\u2019s forced on me as a business owner,\u201d Broes continued. \u201cBut yet it happens so easily on their behalf? What\u2019s the point of enforcing the regulation?\u201d\n\nThe recurring cost to protect such data could exceed millions, particularly for large companies with thousands of employees, Broes said.\n\nAnthony Burke, an IRS spokesman, told FoxNews.com he was looking into the matter early Friday.\n\nBroes noted that the IRS will be in charge of enforcing many aspects of ObamaCare and questioned if the errant fax is representative of the way the agency handles Americans' most personal information.\n\n\u201cA chain is only as strong as its weakest link,\u201d he told FoxNews.com. \u201cEither get it right or don\u2019t do it. It\u2019s a joke.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.modified": "2015-02-02 01:26:42 EST", "dcterms.abstract": "The IRS mistakenly sent \u201csensitive taxpayer data\u201d intended for a California
