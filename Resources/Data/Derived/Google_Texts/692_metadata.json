Steve Beshear at the Big Four Bridge re-dedication in June 2014. (Photo: Jessica Ebelhar/The Courier-Journal)Buy Photo\n\nFRANKFORT, Ky. \u2013 For most of his eight years as governor, Steve Beshear seemed a man in search of a legacy.\n\nThe worst economic recession since the Great Depression made impossible any expensive initiatives or program expansions. It forced deep spending cuts \u2013 even in priority areas like education.\n\nA stubbornly conservative Republican majority in the state Senate also blocked Beshear\u2019s 2007 campaign priority to create a rich source of new state revenue by legalizing casinos.\n\nBut in the sixth year of his administration, Beshear found a clear legacy that required no immediate state money and could be implemented by executive order.\n\nOn May 9, 2013, he announced he would embrace the federal Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, and expand the Medicaid program to cover hundreds of thousands of additional Kentuckians. He called his action \u201cthe single-most important decision in our lifetime for improving the health of Kentuckians.\u201d\n\nAnd as he leaves office, Beshear says the decision has paid bigger dividends than expected since the percentage of Kentuckians without health insurance has plunged from 20.4 percent to 9 percent.\n\n\u201cHis legacy is definitely going to be access to health care. The result has been that over 500,000 have gotten coverage because he put the health of Kentuckians as his priority,\" said Emily Beauregard, executive director of Kentucky Voices for Health.\n\nBut many Republicans like Senate Majority Leader Damon Thayer said the move has caused complications for providers and patients, and they reject Beshear\u2019s claim that the move will not cause budgetary headaches for state government.\n\n\u201cAccess to health insurance does not always mean access to health care,\u201d Thayer said. \u201cGov. Beshear has built a very intricate web of challenges for those of us who will be remaining in Frankfort to debate and implement policy.\u201d\n\nThe Beshear administration, of course, has been about much more than health care.\n\nIn his inaugural address eight years ago, the governor urged that partisanship be put aside. \u201cWe can accomplish much over the next four years, but only if we work together for the common good.\u201d\n\nThe road was bumpy. He clashed constantly with Republican Senate President David Williams and called six special legislative sessions to tend to unfinished business.\n\nBut he found common ground with the Senate on significant bills: combating prescription drug and heroin abuse, building the Louisville bridges, raising the dropout age, resolving a financial crisis in the Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund caused by the recession, raising the tax on cigarettes and alcoholic beverages to help cover a revenue shortage, and pension reform.\n\nBut he also leaves office with Kentucky\u2019s public pension systems still saddled with more than $30 billion in unfunded liabilities.\n\n\u201cReforms passed in 2013 were a step forward. But it has been oversold,\u201d said Jim Carroll, co-founder of Kentucky Government Retirees, a state retiree advocacy group. \u201cOne got the impression that they had fixed pensions, which, of course, is nonsense.\u201d\n\nThe pension systems' needs for huge additional appropriations next year are the main reason incoming Republican Gov. Matt Bevin said last week that Beshear is \u201cleaving Kentucky burdened with a projected biennial shortfall of more than $500 million.\u201d\n\nBeshear said in a press conference last month that the \u201cunfunded liability was created over 20, 25 years, a little at a time, and a lot of different factors went into creating that unfunded liability.\u201d\n\nHe noted that he and the General Assembly twice addressed the larger financial problems of Kentucky Retirement Systems, including a 2013 commitment to begin fully funding the state contribution as set by the systems\u2019 actuaries.\n\n\u201cIt took about 20 years to get into this mess,\u201d Beshear said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take about 20 years to get out of it.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to overestimate the impact of the national recession on state government during the Beshear tenure. A plunging stock market devastated investment returns of the pension funds.\n\nOf more immediate concern when Beshear took office was that the recession was causing tax revenues to plunge far below expectations.\n\nBeshear was forced to impose about $1.6 billion in spending cuts through his first six years. He did more than cut: There were unpaid furloughs for state workers, a tax amnesty program and transfers of hundreds of millions of dollars from small fee-funded independent programs to minimize cuts to education. Beshear and his top staff took 10 percent pay cuts.\n\nMostly forgotten was passage of a modest tax increase \u2013 probably the most politically difficult bill passed while Beshear was governor. The bill, enacted at the pit of the recession in 2009 with crucial support from Williams, raised the cigarette tax by 30 cents per pack and applied the state\u2019s 6 percent sales tax to alcoholic beverages.\n\nBeshear prioritized the spending cuts, sparing public schools from the worst. But some areas saw state funding reduced 40 percent.\n\nTom FitzGerald, director of the Kentucky Resources Council, said cuts at the Energy and Environment Cabinet have left it \"only marginally able to implement the vital protections that federal and state law require for clean air, clean water and uncontaminated, productive land. He (Beshear) will not be remembered for his environmental efforts.\u201d\n\nIn February 2013, Beshear spelled out the damage of cuts in an impassioned pitch for raising revenue through tax reform. \u201cWe eliminated funding for textbooks. \u2026 We cut school safety. \u2026 We cut funding for our universities. \u2026 We reduced aid to needy students. \u2026 We cut funding for child-care assistance.\u201d\n\nThe House chamber was somber as Beshear continued. \u201cOur schools aren\u2019t treading water. They are slowly sinking.\u201d\n\nBut Beshear\u2019s argument that tax reform was needed to repair the damage and adequately fund pensions fell on deaf ears. Lawmakers ignored his tax plan \u2013 which was a significantly reduced version of a massive reform suggested by a commission that the governor had appointed to study the issue.\n\nBeshear told reporters last month his biggest regret was \u201cnot being able to make any meaningful progress in tax reform.\u201d\n\nRep. Rick Rand, a Bedford Democrat who chairs the House budget committee, said, \"Gov. Beshear navigated the recession brilliantly, basically keeping vital services like education and public safety going. ... But tax reform is simply the absolute hardest thing to ever try to get passed.\"\n\nAnother regret Beshear mentioned was failure to expand legal gambling \u2013 his 2007 campaign promise that also would have eased the lingering budget problems.\n\nRep. Larry Clark, D-Louisville, said Beshear successfully pushed for passage of many important bills but gambling was one area where the governor could never find common ground with the Senate \u2013 particularly with the horse industry never unifying behind a specific approach.\n\n\u201cThe Senate was adamantly opposed to any form of gaming,\u201d Clark said. \u201cThe House took it up a couple times but eventually our members felt unless both chambers could support it, there was no sense going on with that.\u201d\n\nBy the beginning of 2015, state revenues were growing again, and growing a bit better than expectations. The pension funding crisis remained a dark cloud, but in an election year with chances of passing a tax or gambling bill long gone, Beshear had a different tone in his annual message to the General Assembly.\n\n\u201cMy friends, we can hold our heads high once again because Kentucky is back. And we\u2019re back with a vengeance.\u201d\n\nThe coda for the Beshear administration was a year dominated by the governor continuing to nurture and defend his health care accomplishments while dealing with the same-sex marriage issue amid the election of his successor.\n\nThayer credited Beshear for driving negotiations on the 2013 pension bill. And he said he likes Beshear, but he said the governor was a relentless political fundraiser who shouldn't be given too much credit for being non-partisan.\n\n\u201cI would say he\u2019s more hyper-partisan and more liberal than people realize. ... After all, in his first term he told the EPA, 'Get off our backs.\u2019 But after winning re-election ... he enacted Obamacare and told Republicans, \u2018Get over it.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAnd on same-sex marriage, Beshear made decisions that upset the LGBT community by deciding to appeal a federal court ruling that recognized gay marriage, and later the Christian right by failing to come to the rescue of Rowan County Clerk Kim Davis when she was jailed for refusing to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples following the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling on the matter.\n\nIn his talk with reporters last month, Beshear repeated his earlier explanations for appealing the case.\n\n\u201cIf I hadn\u2019t appealed that decision, I\u2019ll bet we would have 80 or 90 Kim Davises in this state because we wouldn\u2019t have any Supreme Court decision telling us what the law is,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd reporters, who for months had asked for Beshear\u2019s feeling on same-sex marriage, got this answer: \u201cAs for my personal feelings, I\u2019ll get around to that one of these days. Just not today.\u201d\n\nReporter Tom Loftus can be reached at (502) 875-5136 or tloftus@courier-journal.com.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://cjky.it/1QiidmU", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "For most of his 8 years as governor, Steve Beshear seemed a man in search of a legacy.
