YouTube\n\n\u201cNothing is impossible, as long as you work hard,\u201d said Ibrahim Hamato, a paralympian who continues to play his favorite sport, table tennis, despite missing both of his arms.\n\nUsing only his mouth, Hamato is able to whip the table tennis paddle with remarkable strength, while hitting the ball quite accurately. He played some of the world\u2019s top, two-armed professional table tennis players, including the International Table Tennis Federation\u2019s number one-ranked player, Ma Long, at the ZEN-NOH World Team Table Tennis Championships in Tokyo, Japan.\n\nHailing from Egypt, Hamato lost his arms at 10 years old due to an unspecified accident. Three years later, he wanted to get back to playing table tennis, but couldn\u2019t use the paddles under his shoulder, so he learned to use his mouth. Since then, he\u2019s gotten better and better, landing himself with an invitation to the competition.\n\nIn the video below, you can see his skills handling the paddle \u2014 his serve alone is something to see \u2014 but he also used his appearance at the competition as a way to raise awareness of paralympian abilities, as well as the ability for anyone with disabilities to achieve their goals. \u201cI believe that para-table tennis in Egypt has a lot of talented players, winning even medals at the Paralympics,\u201d he said, adding that training facilities in Egypt are not as good as others, but if they were, they\u2019d \u201cachieve better results.\u201d\n\nParalympians participate in pretty much any sport a person without disabilities can do, from swimming and track to alpine skiing and hockey.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "table, tennis, paralympian, plays, exceptionally, well, despite, having, no, arms", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Despite having no arms, Ibrahim Hamato is able to play table tennis with the pros at an international competition in Tokyo, Japan.", "title": "Table Tennis Paralympian Plays Exceptionally Well With No Arms", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/table-tennis-paralympian-plays-exceptionally-well-despite-having-no-arms-282166", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/05/13/ibrahim-hamato.JPG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Despite having no arms, Ibrahim Hamato is able to play table tennis with the pros at an international competition in Tokyo, Japan.", "title": "Table Tennis Paralympian Plays Exceptionally Well With No Arms", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/table-tennis-paralympian-plays-exceptionally-well-despite-having-no-arms-282166", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/05/13/ibrahim-hamato.JPG", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/05/13/ibrahim-hamato.JPG"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-05-14T09:00:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-05-14T09:00:02-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Despite having no arms, Ibrahim Hamato is able to play table tennis with the pros at an international competition in Tokyo, Japan."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd36d\"", "article_summary": "He played some of the world\u2019s top, two-armed professional table tennis players, including the International Table Tennis Federation\u2019s number one-ranked player, Ma Long, at the ZEN-NOH World Team Table Tennis Championships in Tokyo, Japan.\nDespite having no arms, Ibrahim Hamato is able to play table tennis with the pros at an international competition in Tokyo, Japan.\nYouTube\u201cNothing is impossible, as long as you work hard,\u201d said Ibrahim Hamato, a paralympian who continues to play his favorite sport, table tennis, despite missing both of his arms.\nThree years later, he wanted to get back to playing table tennis, but couldn\u2019t use the paddles under his shoulder, so he learned to use his mouth.\nUsing only his mouth, Hamato is able to whip the table tennis paddle with remarkable strength, while hitting the ball quite accurately."}
