Since last July, Tenet\u2019s market cap slid more than 50% to about $2.8 billion.\n\nThe company is also carrying the highest debt burden in the business and dealing with fallout from a kickback scandal and whistleblower lawsuit, The Dallas Morning News noted.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nTenet\u2019s long-term debt has roughly tripled over the past three years to $14.4 billion, the report stated.\n\nThe operator had reported in 2015 a loss of $140 million and offered to pay $238 million to settle a False Claims Act lawsuit. Just last month, the organization paid a fine for improperly denying prescription drug coverage and for \"hindering policyholder appeals.\"\n\nTo turns things around, the company is focused on enhancing operations and improving cash flow, rather than more M&A. The company recently sold five Atlanta-area hospitals and will concentrate its efforts in markets where it is one of the key players.\n\nTenet is also looking to the outpatient market to spur financial growth. In 2015, the hospital operator merged with United Surgical Partners, a major outpatient surgery network.\n\nThe company\u2019s struggles are indicative of how the Affordable Care Act is impacting the healthcare industry with lower investor interest in hospitals and pressure to curb expensive inpatient treatments.\n\nRecommended Reading\n\nThe Dallas Morning News: Mitchell Schnurman: From Obamacare cost to debt load, can Dallas health care giant Tenet find a remedy?\n\nBecker's Hospital Review: Tenet to pump the brakes on M&A activity\n\nHealthcare Dive: Tenet leaves S&P\u2019s 500 index, joins MidCap 400\n\nHealthcare Dive: Tenet near settlement on Georgia kickback charges, posts 2015 Q4 loss\n\nThe Vista Voice: Sun Trust Weighs in on Tenet Healthcare Corp\u2019s Q1 2017 Earnings (THC)", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Meg Bryant", "twitter": {"domain": "Healthcare Dive", "site": "@healthcaredive", "card": "summary"}, "featured": "False", "medium": "news", "sailthru.tags": "healthcare,type-newspost,healthcare-finance,healthcare-hospital-admin", "description": "Healthcare", "category": "News Post", "title": "Tenet looks to slower growth, improving cash flow", "pub_date": "apr 27, 2016", "section": "news", "sailthru.date": "2016-04-27T22:33:54", "content_boost": 4, "touched": "True", "article_date_original": "Wednesday, April 27, 2016, 10:33 PM", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/user_media/cache/af/19/af199034d26b7baf299605e77ac0a9f6.jpg", "news_keywords": "Finance,Hospital Administration,Hospital Admin", "sailthru.expire_date": "2026-04-15T22:33:54", "teaser": "<p>The hospital operator&rsquo;s market value dropped to about $2.8 billion since July, causing it to leave&nbsp;the S&amp;P 500.&nbsp;</p>", "sponsored": "False", "date": "2016-04-27", "sailthru.description": "The hospital operator\u2019s market value dropped to about $2.8 billion since July, causing it to leave\u00a0the S&P 500.", "viewport": "width=986", "og": {"site_name": "Healthcare Dive", "description": "The hospital operator\u2019s market value dropped to about $2.8 billion since July, causing it to leave\u00a0the S&P 500.", "title": "Tenet looks to slower growth, improving cash flow", "url": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/news/tenet-looks-to-slower-growth-improving-cash-flow/418147/", "image": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/user_media/diveimage/file7411252893790.jpg", "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "aN-77CvDv8Rt4OQnHMaUSm6V87TF8ri5GDUv93p7pHk", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/user_media/cache/d6/69/d669fdc72a5021257afc051f1cf772b1.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8adc\"", "article_summary": "Dive Brief:After a string of mergers and acquisitions, Tenet Healthcare is applying the brakes on further growth, The Dallas Morning News reported.\nBecker's Hospital Review: Tenet to pump the brakes on M&A activityHealthcare Dive: Tenet leaves S&P\u2019s 500 index, joins MidCap 400Healthcare Dive: Tenet near settlement on Georgia kickback charges, posts 2015 Q4 lossThe Vista Voice: Sun Trust Weighs in on Tenet Healthcare Corp\u2019s Q1 2017 Earnings (THC)\nRecommended ReadingThe Dallas Morning News: Mitchell Schnurman: From Obamacare cost to debt load, can Dallas health care giant Tenet find a remedy?\n3 hospital operator in the U.S., recently left the S&P 500 because of a sharp decline in its market value.\nIn 2015, the hospital operator merged with United Surgical Partners, a major outpatient surgery network."}
