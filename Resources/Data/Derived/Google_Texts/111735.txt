Texas Monthly names new editor in chief

Texas Monthly has named Brian Sweany its next editor-in-chief, the magazine announced on Tuesday.

Sweany replaces Jake Silverstein, who was named editor of The New York Times Magazine in March. The parent company of Texas Monthly sued the Times over Silverstein's hire, claiming the paper has not made good on an agreement to negotiate the termination of Silverstein's three-year Texas Monthly contract, which expires in February 2015.

"I am honored to be named the editor in chief of Texas Monthly. I am in awe of its past — and I have the highest expectations for its future," Sweany said on Twitter.

Sweany started his journalism career at Texas Monthly as an intern in 1996. He was most recently a senior executive editor for the magazine.
