The hour-long event covered topics ranging from Islamic State militants to the Affordable Care Act, and it was contentious.\n\nThe debate was held at Pinehurst\u2019s historic Carolina Hotel, with WRAL\u2019s David Crabtree as the moderator. His first question was about foreign policy- whether the candidates support President Obama\u2019s actions against the group known as the Islamic State. He also asked if the candidates would support sending in ground troops. Aiken, whose turn was first, said he\u2019s behind the president\u2019s plan, but that other countries in the region should pitch in.\n\n\"I don\u2019t believe the US should be policing the entire world,\" said Aiken. \"And I don\u2019t want to use our men and women at Fort Bragg or any of the men and women serving in the military here in the US as GI Joe soldiers where we place them in harm\u2019s way all around the world to police the problems of others.\"\n\nEllmers said she also supports the president\u2019s plan. She called the Islamic State \u201cthe most brutal heinous group we\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d And she went on to say it threatens this country domestically. When pressed by David Crabtree, Ellmers said she thinks the U.S. could do more to stop the group overseas.\n\n\"We do need to be in the world, we have to show a presence of strength to keep peace,\" said Ellmers.\n\n\"If called on to vote,\" asked Crabtree, \"would you vote to send American ground troops there?\"\n\n\"I would,\" said Ellmers.\n\nThat sparked the first of several contentious exchanges between the two.\n\nAiken said Ellmers had not supported sending ground troops to fight the Islamic State Group previously- until U.S. Speaker of the House John Boehner recently said on ABC\u2019s This Week that sending ground troops may be necessary.\n\n\"Congresswoman Ellmers went on the record not too long ago saying that John Boehner was her boss and that you don\u2019t want to upset the boss, and so I understand if that\u2019s her mindset then that\u2019s probably why she\u2019s changed her tune now,\" Aiken said.\n\nWhen asked whether the U.S. can depend on its Arab allies in the region, Ellmers circled back to the topic of John Boehner:\n\n\"John Boehner may be the Speaker of the House, but the people of Distict Two are my boss, and that is exactly why we\u2019re here today.\"\n\nThe two then started talking over each other, with Ellmers making a jab at Aiken\u2019s previous career, which took off after he was the American Idol runner up more than a decade ago.\n\n\"And this is one of the things that maybe as an entertainer you\u2019re not aware of- these things are fluid- and when the president asked for his support- he asked for it in a certain way- we gave him that support,\" said Ellmers.\n\nMilitary\n\nEllmers continued bringing up Aiken\u2019s career in the next topic- Fort Bragg, an important part of the Second Congressional District. Aiken pointed out that Ellmers voted for last year\u2019s sequestration, which resulted in temporary budget cuts at the base. He also said she didn\u2019t work hard enough to keep the 440th Airlift Wing at Fort Bragg.\n\nEllmers responded by saying the cuts were prompted by President Obama\u2019s budget, and called Aiken an entertainer again.\n\nAiken responded: \"Congresswoman Ellmers is good at her talking points, good at calling me an entertainer, that\u2019s great, I\u2019m sure you practiced on that. But the most embarrassing reality show right now in the country is Congress.\"\n\nHealthcare\n\nLater in the debate, the conversation moved to Obamacare. Ellmers said she and other Republicans would like to reform the program. But Aiken said Ellmers had voted to get rid of it many times. He noted that Republican Senator Richard Burr had co-sponsored a bill to replace the Affordable Care Act with a set of market-based reforms, rather than simply voting against it.\n\nAiken: \"You said to David just a few minutes ago that yes, you had voted to repeal it several times.\"\n\nReplied Ellmers: \"We have voted a number of times...and Senator Burr is in the Senate. I\u2019m not sure you understand that he\u2019s presented it to the House. I think you\u2019re confused at how the process works.\"\n\nAiken responded: \"I\u2019m not confused, I\u2019m well aware of civics.\"\n\nThis was the first and only debate between Representative Ellmers and Clay Aiken. There are no more scheduled before the general election on November fourth.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Politics & Government", "description": "Republican U.S. Representative Renee Ellmers of the Second Congressional District and her challenger, Democrat Clay Aiken, held their first and only debate", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://wunc.org/post/us-representative-renee-ellmers-and-clay-aiken-spar-debate-0", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/wunc/files/styles/medium/public/201410/IMAG0608.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Republican U.S. Representative Renee Ellmers of the Second Congressional District and her challenger, Democrat Clay Aiken, held their first and only debate", "title": "U.S. Representative Renee Ellmers and Clay Aiken Spar In Debate"}, "story_id": 354238132, "twitter": {"site": "@wunc", "card": "summary", "creator": "@wunc"}, "author": "Jessica Jones", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "U.S. Representative Renee Ellmers and Clay Aiken Spar In Debate"}, "nid": 43274, "datePublished": "2014-10-07", "keywords": "2014 NC Congress, U.S. Representative Renee Ellmers, Clay Aiken", "wordCount": 864, "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdc3e\"", "article_summary": "Republican U.S. Representative Renee Ellmers of the Second Congressional District and her challenger, Democrat Clay Aiken, held their first and only debate in Pinehurst Tuesday.\nAiken pointed out that Ellmers voted for last year\u2019s sequestration, which resulted in temporary budget cuts at the base.\nThis was the first and only debate between Representative Ellmers and Clay Aiken.\nThe hour-long event covered topics ranging from Islamic State militants to the Affordable Care Act, and it was contentious.\nHis first question was about foreign policy- whether the candidates support President Obama\u2019s actions against the group known as the Islamic State."}
