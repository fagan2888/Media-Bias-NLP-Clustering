In 2014, there were 31,864 finishers.\n\nThe first Bridge Run was held on Sunday, April 2, 1978 and it was one of the hottest Bridge Run days on record at 82 degrees. That first year was the only year the race was held on Sunday. After complaints from area churches, the decision was made to permanently move the race to Saturday morning.\n\nThe race is now always held on the first Saturday of April, unless that date falls on the day before Easter Sunday, as it did this year.\n\nFrom 1978 until 2005, runners crossed the old Silas Pearman Bridge. In 2005, 18,480 people finished the race. The following year, 33,742 completed the first race over the Arthur Ravenel Bridge.\n\nIn 2014, Birhan Nebebew of Ethiopia won the race with a time of 28:39.
