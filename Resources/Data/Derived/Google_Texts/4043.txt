Crews with the City of Meridian are getting Bonita Lakes Park ready for the thousands of people expected to fill the park grounds to enjoy the annual Fourth of July Celebration.

“We have such a great crew out here at Bonita, they start getting the park ready and working hard to make sure that everything is pretty and pristine, so months ahead of time we start preparing for the event, making sure the fireworks are ordered and getting our entertainment lined up and getting everything ready,” explained Laura Carmichael, Cultural Affairs Coordinator with the City of Meridian.

Gates to the park will open at three thirty in the afternoon on the Fourth with vendors starting at four. Parking at Bonita Lakes Park will be limited with more parking available by Bonita Lakes Mall.

“We have Choctaw Transit and the Meridian Trolley will be making runs over to Bonita Lakes Mall area near Tuesday Morning right behind Belk, so you can park there where there is plenty of parking and ride the shuttle over and that way you don’t have to worry with the traffic,” stated Carmichael.

This free family friendly event will have it all to celebrate Independence Day including some great entertainment to rock the night.

“Aa’Keela & the Beats, which we are really excited about that and then N’Tune featuring Kidd Kabana will be on stage, lots of patriotic music and of course the big climax to the evening is our fireworks show and we are really excited about the fireworks,” stated Carmichael.

Fireworks are in place and ready to launch tomorrow night, but where is the best seat in park to see the fireworks?

“Right across the lake is where the band is set up which is the lower lake by the boat ramp, it is a great place to view the fireworks there because you are right across from the actual launching site, but really anywhere around the lake you will be able to see them, they are just beautiful,” said Carmichael.

Fireworks will end the celebration and will begin at 9 PM tomorrow night.
