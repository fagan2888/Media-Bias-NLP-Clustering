LOS ANGELES (AP) - The newest member of the Kardashian clan has arrived.

Kim Kardashian West and Kanye West welcomed a baby boy early Saturday in Los Angeles.

“He’s here!” the reality star teased on Twitter. An announcement on Kardashian’s website reads, “KANYE AND I WELCOME OUR BABY BOY!”

A representative for the couple confirms to The Associated Press that mom and baby are doing well. There was no immediate word on the baby’s name.

Kardashian West has tracked her pregnancy online for her 37 million Twitter followers, posting an image late Friday of her bare belly with the caption, “Ready whenever you are lol.”

This is the second child for the stellar couple: Daughter North was born in 2013.

Kardashian, 35, and West, 38, were married last year in Florence, Italy, in a gala ceremony filmed for E!’s “Keeping Up With the Kardashians.” West proposed to his bride in October 2013, renting out San Francisco’s AT&T; Park for the occasion.

West was in New York earlier this week for the Footwear News Achievement Awards, where he gave a rambling 20-minute acceptance speech after his Adidas Yeezy Boost sneaker was named shoe of the year.
