LOUIS (AP) - When the bell rings at St. Louis Children's Hospital, it\u2019s time for celebration.\n\nThe big brass bell that hangs near the nurses\u2019 station is rung only by young patients who have finished chemotherapy or radiation.\n\nOn Jan. 12, Janet Pruneau, of O\u2019Fallon, Ill., got her turn. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch (http://bit.ly/1gQU5o5 ) reports that the 5-year-old was tentative at first but with encouragement from family, friends and hospital staff, she rang the bell six times for each round of chemotherapy she had endured.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like her to ring it 100 times if she wants to,\u201d said Kathryn Lenhardt, Janet\u2019s grandmother.\n\nDoctors found a tumor in the back of Janet\u2019s head last spring. Biopsy results were inconclusive so Janet became one of the first children to have genetic sequencing to help doctors with a treatment plan.\n\nShe spent more time at the hospital than at home over the past several months, including Halloween, her birthday, Thanksgiving and Christmas. She will have regular scans to check for recurrence for years to come.\n\nAbout 50 kids ring the bell each year at St. Louis Children's Hospital. The charity Friends of Kids with Cancer provides a party with cake and presents for the kids who want it.\n\n\u201cOur families have loved it because they actually look forward to this day now,\u201d said Jenny Brandt, a child life specialist at the hospital. \u201cOur staff get very emotional, because it also symbolizes all the hard work they have done with the patients and families.\u201d\n\nDr. Emily Walling said she\u2019ll miss hearing Janet and her roommate\u2019s giggles echo across the oncology floor - but she\u2019s thrilled her chemo treatments are over.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a privilege to take them through this difficult time,\u201d Walling said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s encouragement to other patients that we can beat this.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: St. Louis Post-Dispatch, http://www.stltoday.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "When the bell rings at St. Louis Children's Hospital, it's time for celebration.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jan/19/kids-with-cancer-ring-bell-mark-end-of-treatment/", "type": "article", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "When the bell rings at St. Louis Children\u2019s Hospital, it\u2019s time for celebration.", "title": "Kids with cancer ring bell, mark end of treatment"}, "twitter": {"title": "Kids with cancer ring bell, mark end of treatment", "description": "When the bell rings at St. Louis Children's Hospital, it's time for celebration.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Health Medical Pharma, Janet Pruneau, St Louis Children  Hospital, Louis Children Hospital"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0004\"", "article_summary": "ST.
