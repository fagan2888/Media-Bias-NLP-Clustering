All, except the Niceville Eagles.\n\n2013's runner up for the 7-A State title had an amazing opportunity for head coach John Hicks and his program to kick off the season Saturday on national television, six days before the scheduled start, in Hoover, Alabama, on ESPNU.\n\nBut their competition, Clay-Chalkville, a 6A school from 'Bama, were no joke.\n\nIn the first quarter, QB Tyrell Pigrome hits TJ Simmons, who was left wide open for a 52 yard TD to start the scoring. Clay-Chalkville led 14-0 after one.\n\nIt was 17-0 in the second quarter when the Eagles defense continued to struggle for a stop and Pigrome busts them wide open for an 84 yard TD run to make it 23-0.\n\nNiceville finally got on the board when Drew Frederic keeps it on the read option for a three yard touchdown.\n\nClay-Chalkville led 30-7 at the half.\n\nIn the third quarter, the Eagles gave it to their main playmaker this year, Eli Stove, the junior wide out, who took an end around 63 yards and outruns everyone for six.\n\nSaturday, Niceville just ran into a stronger opponent, though.\n\nThe Eagles drop to 0-1 in 2014, falling 44-23.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hoover, AL---In high school football, all area teams are waiting for Friday night to kick off their 2014 opener.
