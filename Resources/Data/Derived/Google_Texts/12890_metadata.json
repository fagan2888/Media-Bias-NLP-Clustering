First it was IMAX and 3D, and now it\u2019s WeDong.\n\nWanda Cinema Line Corporation, China\u2019s largest cinema operator, is teaming up with Singaporean company Yummi Media Group to expand use of the interactive mobile app WeDong in its theaters across China, according to a Yummi statement Monday.\n\nWeDong, called \u201cCinime\u201d outside of China, is mobile technology that enables users to play with the big screen, taking quizzes and playing movie-related games with other viewers, according to Yummi. The company says movie goers can also use the app to buy tickets and get promotional deals, like popcorn from the concession.\n\nEntertainment and property conglomerate Dalian Wanda Group Co, said in a statement that the WeDong effort \u201creflects the entertainment and enjoyment of movie media.\u201d\n\nWeDong comes as companies look for ways to make movie-going more interactive. Some theaters launched earlier this year a pop-up commenting section on screen, enabling viewers to chat about the films while they watch them. That sparked a debate about whether it detracted from movies \u2014 or actually made watching bad movies more enjoyable.\n\nWhile WeDong isn\u2019t geared to the pop-up film critics, viewers can use it to scan movie posters to see movie trailers and reward frequent-viewers with prizes, according to information on Yummi\u2019s cinime website.\n\nThe move also reflects Wanda\u2019s push to connect the online world with its offline business. The company, which runs more than 100 shopping malls across the country, joined with e-commerce giants Baidu Inc. and Tencent Holdings Ltd. in August to create a 5 billion yuan ($810 million) e-commerce venture. The venture is set to link Baidu and Tencent\u2019s online maps and search functions with Wanda\u2019s luxury hotels, shopping malls and movie theaters and will also give customers new ways to pay on their mobile for offline goods.\n\n\u2013 Laurie Burkitt.
