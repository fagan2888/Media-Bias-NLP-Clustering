(AP Photo/Lynne Sladky)</p>\n\nBy Isadora Rangel of TCPalm\n\nU.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy won two elections in a swing district as a centrist who touted his votes across party lines in Congress.\n\nThat worked in District 18. Will it work in a Senate Democratic primary?\n\nAfter becoming the first candidate to announce he\u2019s running for Republican Sen. Marco Rubio\u2019s seat on Monday, some of those votes \u2014 from his support for the controversial Keystone XL pipeline to changes to the Affordable Care Act \u2014 could be ammunition for a potential primary opponent trying to convince voters Murphy, a one-time Republican, isn\u2019t a true Democrat.\n\nMurphy might find himself courting liberals during the primary and switching to moderates if he makes it to the general election, experts say.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether Murphy will have a primary challenger after former Gov. Charlie Crist and Rep. Debbie Wasserman-Schultz, the Democratic National Committee chairwoman, announced they aren\u2019t seeking the seat in 2016. Rubio is expected to announce soon he will run for president.\n\nMurphy is seen as one of a few Democrats with potential to win statewide as his party gears up to regain the Senate majority lost in last year\u2019s midterm.\n\nOrlando Rep. Alan Grayson, a liberal firebrand known for making inflammatory comments, said Murphy\u2019s announcement didn\u2019t discourage him from running but he said he\u2019s in no rush to make an announcement.\n\nHe said he would motivate Democrats to take to the polls with a populist approach \u2014 calling for Social Security and Medicare expansion \u2014 similar to how President Barack Obama ran his campaigns. Grayson is famous for saying \u201cRepublicans want you to die quickly\u201d during a 2009 House floor speech on health care.\n\n\u201cMy campaign would generate the same kind of enthusiasm (as Obama) among voters,\u201d Grayson, who didn\u2019t want to comment on Murphy, said. \u201cWe create a campaign that gets people\u2019s attention; a campaign with actual issues rather than personalities.\u201d\n\nWasserman-Schultz said during a CBS Miami interview this month she expects a competitive Democratic primary, and mentioned several mayors who could also jump in, such as Bob Buckhorn in Tampa, Buddy Dyer in Orlando and Alvin Brown in Jacksonville.\n\nDIFFERENCES\n\nMurphy and Grayson sit on opposite spectrums of the Democratic Party.\n\nMurphy, the son of a construction company owner, was a Republican until 2011 and switched parties soon before filing to run for Congress because of the Tea Party\u2019s rise, and donated to Republican Mitt Romney\u2019s presidential campaign in 2008.\n\nHe represents a slightly Republican-leaning district covering Martin, St. Lucie and northern Palm Beach counties. Grayson\u2019s Central Florida district has more registered Democrats and independents.\n\nMurphy voted against his party leadership on 62 percent of the final passage of bills this year, according to records from Open Congress, a nonpartisan website that tracks Congress members.\n\nGrayson, a lawyer, only strayed from the party on 7 percent of votes.\n\nMurphy, for example, voted to approve the controversial Keystone XL pipeline, opposed by Grayson and most Democrats because they say it would contribute to global warming. Last year, Murphy approved changes to the Affordable Care Act, such as a measure Grayson opposed that increases the full-employment threshold from 30 to 40 hours so fewer employers are mandated to offer health coverage to full-time employees.\n\nSTRATEGY\n\nMurphy touted his independence during his re-election campaign last year and said he won\u2019t change his strategy to appeal to different voters. Despite voting with Republicans, he has many progressive views: he supports gay marriage and laws requiring equal pay for women and is pro abortion rights, chief of staff Eric Johnson said.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day what voters really want is someone who can be effective and get things done,\u201d Murphy said during an interview last week.\n\nBut as much as voters say they are tired of partisan politics, when they go to the polls they tend to stick to candidates who fit a party\u2019s ideology, said Tallahassee-based GOP strategist Rick Wilson, adding House Democrats probably gave Murphy leeway to vote against the party because he\u2019s in a swing district.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to have to explain how ... he will have an effective leadership for Florida if he doesn\u2019t have an ideological sense,\u201d Wilson said.\n\nMurphy has proven he appeals to voters across all parties but his real challenge will be in the general election, said Democratic strategist Steve Schale, who ran President Barack Obama\u2019s 2008 Florida campaign.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a tone Grayson carries and I don\u2019t think it appeals to voters,\u201d Schale said.\n\nIf Rubio doesn\u2019t seek re-election to run for the White House, Murphy could face Republicans such as CFO Jeff Atwater, a former state Senate president who Schale said appeals to Democrats as well. Other potential GOP contenders are Attorney General Pam Bondi, former state House Speaker Will Weatherford and Lt. Gov. Carlos Lopez-Cantera.\n\nPolitical analyst Brian Crowley, a WPTV commentator and author of the Crowley Political Report website, said he expects Murphy\u2019s opponents to focus more on his young age \u2014 he will be 32 on Monday \u2014 and inexperience than his ideology. Still, that might not work as more young voters normally vote during presidential election years, Crowley said.", "article_metadata": {"title": "Is Patrick Murphy too Republican to win Democratic votes?", "og": {"url": "http://www.tcpalm.com/news/is-patrick-murphy-too-republican-to-win-democratic-votes-ep-1011443122-332646821.html", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/murphy_patrick_15693284_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "height": 432}, "type": "article", "description": "U.S. Rep.
