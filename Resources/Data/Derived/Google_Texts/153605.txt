A new three minute ad called “Stop Gun Violence” is sending a very mixed message to children—namely, if you’re scared of guns bring them to school.

The ad is as ridiculous as it sounds. The clip, created by independent filmmaker Rejina Sincic, shows a boy sneaking into his mother’s room (while she sits reads demurely in the living room) only to steal the handgun that is hidden in one of her dresser drawers.

The boy then tosses the gun into his backpack and flops back on his bed as though heavily burdened. And, considering he just put a handgun into his backpack without making sure that there was no bullet in the chamber that the safety was on, he should be feeling pretty worried right now.

The next day after class, he walks up to his teacher and drops the weapon onto her desk:

“Can you take this away? I don’t feel safe with a gun in my house.”

Just watch:

This ad just has so much wrong with it, I don’t even know where to begin:

First of all, why would the boy be scared of his mother’s handgun? He should know that the weapon has the potential to save his and his mother’s life.

Secondly, if a child is afraid of guns, the last thing he or she should be doing is bringing one to school. Apparently this thought never occurred to the San Francisco-based screenwriter.

Thirdly, why would the boy turn on his mother and bring the gun into a public authority figure rather than speaking to her about it? And what is a teacher supposed to do? Confiscate the weapon that the mother (perhaps a single mother as the father is never shown) owns by her Second Amendment right?

Clearly, someone did not think this one through.
