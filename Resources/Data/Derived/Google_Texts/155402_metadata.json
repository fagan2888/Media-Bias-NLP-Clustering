As a result of the muscle strain, Cristiano missed Real Madrid\u2019s next two games, a 4-1 win over visiting Galatasaray on November 27 and another home win on November 30, a 4-0 victory over Real Valladolid. As previously reported by The Inquisitr, Gareth Bale filled in against Galatasaray in Cristiano Ronaldo\u2019s absence.\n\n\u201cI no longer have an injury,\u201d Ronaldo said at an awards ceremony in Madrid, via Reuters.\n\n\u201cI have been fine for a couple of days,\u201d Cristiano added.\n\nRonaldo explained he did not want to his luck by returning early against Real Valladolid; Cristiano insisted he would be ready for Real Madrid\u2019s next match, a King\u2019s Cup match against Olimpic de Xativa on Saturday, December 7.\n\nOn the strength of his year, Cristiano Ronaldo is one of the favorites to win the coveted Ballon d\u2019Or awarded by FIFA for the year\u2019s greatest footballer. Ronaldo was the last person to win the annual award before Argentina\u2019s Lionel Messi started sweeping the prize the past 4 years.\n\nThe winner is scheduled to be announced on January 13, 2014, in Zurich, but Cristiano Ronaldo may not be in attendance. Rumors that the Portuguese superstar may boycott the ceremony have been swirling through the soccer scene amid Ronaldo\u2019s spat with FIFA honcho Sepp Blatter over mocking comments the president of world soccer made. When asked to compare Ronaldo and Messi, Blatter made the verbal blunder of saying he preferred Messi because Ronaldo spent more time at the hairdresser.\n\nBlatter has since explained and apologized for his remarks, stressing \u201cit is my opinion that Cristiano Ronaldo is at the same level as Messi and that both are extraordinary players, each in his own way.\u201d\n\nFor his part, Ronaldo has neither confirmed nor denied the idea that he might boycott the Ballon d\u2019Or.\n\nWhat do you think about Cristiano Ronaldo\u2019s chances for the Ballon d\u2019Or? Is Cristiano right to be upset? Should Ronaldo boycott the ceremony?", "article_metadata": {"description": "Soccer star and Ballon d'Or favorite Cristiano Ronaldo is injury free and ready to head back out on the pitch for Real Madrid, he announced Monday.
