After two rounds of \u201cin jeopardy,\u201d Gary and Anna became the fourth couple to depart season 21 of \u201cDWTS.\u201d Show hosts Tom Bergeron and Erin Andrews will have far duller lives now that they don\u2019t have to make sense of all of Gary\u2019s sayings.\n\nGary says the idea he has been eliminated is false because his spirit will remain in the ballroom. One of the hosts tries to cut him off. Gary won\u2019t have anything to do with that.\n\nThis week, Carlos PenaVega and Witney Carson played the in-jeopardy game.\n\nThis Monday brings the return of Most Memorable Year of Your Life, not to mention three celebrities dancing to their own songs. Get the tissues ready for some of the stories, notably Bindi Irwin\u2019s. Meanwhile, for Alek Skarlatos, reality invaded the ballroom this week. If he hadn\u2019t been dancing on national television following his role in saving a potential terror attack in Paris, he would have been in classes at Umpqua Community College \u2013 site of Thursday\u2019s mass shooting. Please, \u201cDWTS\u201d producers, don\u2019t manipulate this storyline.\n\nReality also invaded our host roster, as Tom Bergeron has left the glitz of Los Angeles to be with his seriously ill father on the East Coast this week. Filling in? Season 19 winner and last week\u2019s guest judge, Alfonso Ribeiro. At this point, what hasn\u2019t Alfonso done on \u201cDWTS?\u201d\n\nI'll miss 2morrow's #dwts to be at my Dad's bedside. He's given me a lifetime of support. Time to return the favor. pic.twitter.com/l8NmkFUSkC \u2014 Tom Bergeron (@Tom_Bergeron) October 5, 2015\n\nAlexa PenaVega (2000) and Mark Ballas, foxtrot, \u201cMama Said\u201d\n\nAlexa looks back at the year her family moved to Texas so she could act in \u201cSpy Kids.\u201d Alfonso\u2019s comment last week about Carlos not being her partner in the ballroom doesn\u2019t sit well with her \u2013 what will it will be like when they see each other again? (Spoiler: They didn\u2019t address it.) Did you know Makenzie Vega, aka Grace from \u201cThe Good Wife,\u201d is one of Alexa\u2019s sisters? Alexa\u2019s mother used to play \u201cMama Said\u201d as Alexa and her sisters danced together as young\u2019uns. Mark has crafted an adorable story for this foxtrot, with a flustered Alexa, an umbrella and lingering rain. Alexa\u2019s flustered nature isn\u2019t just acting, though: She seems to be lost. The dance doesn\u2019t feel smooth, with slight hesitations throughout that aren\u2019t in line with the choreography. Alexa also bobbles the footwork toward the end, which she describes to Erin as a \u201cblackout moment.\u201d Alexa laughs as she approaches the judges\u2019 table \u2013 she knows she messed up. Julianne Hough deems the concept a brilliant one but points out the loss of footing at the end. Bruno Tonioli laments, \u201cYou missed the train, but you found your way.\u201d For additional ballroom dances, he advises Alexa, remember to lift from the waist. Carrie Ann Inaba enjoys the theatricality and the lightness of character. Score: 21 (Carrie Ann 7, Julianne 7, Bruno 7).\n\nGary Busey (1979) and Anna Trebunskaya, jazz, \u201cThat\u2019ll Be the Day\u201d\n\nGary became an Oscar nominee in 1979 for playing Buddy Holly, but the year his package delves into more is 1988. Anna talks about how, when teaching the actor, she must account for the traumatic brain injury he incurred in 1988 after a motorcycle accident. Gary\u2019s family and friends talk about how he battled back after his injury and how proud they are to still have him. For the jazz, Gary reprises a Buddy Holly look. I\u2019m not sure this is jazz, even by the loose \u201cDWTS\u201d interpretation of it. It\u2019s more a mishmash of dance moves put together for a school dance. Gary and Anna aren\u2019t exactly dancing together. Gary is having a blast, but it\u2019s more as if he and Anna just happen to be on the same floor at the same time. Bruno says the passion almost makes him forget the dance moves lack precision. Carrie Ann worries because \u201cwe almost lost Anna\u201d and Gary hasn\u2019t shown the level of improvement she wants to see. Julianne compliments Anna for her work with the star. Backstage, Gary sort of confirms that he directed the lighting and the set design. He also talks about the \u201cheart of the dance.\u201d Score: 16 (Carrie Ann 5, Julianne 6, Bruno 5).\n\nOh, Tom, how I wish you were here for this next segment. Bruno talks about his most memorable year, 1983, when he appeared in Elton John\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m Still Standing\u201d video \u2013 and \u201cbecame an international sex symbol.\u201d Whenever \u201cDWTS\u201d trots this out, Tom eggs the producers on and takes joy in needling Bruno. This week, Tom probably would have keeled over laughing as Troupe member Sasha Farber twirled and flipped on to the stage in Bruno\u2019s red and black Spandex garb. Sasha is an international treasure. Could he please be a pro again?\n\nTamar Braxton (2012) and Val Chmerkovskiy, rumba, \u201cKing\u201d\n\nVal agrees that he and Tamar are lacking chemistry on the dance floor, and he wants to bring that out more. (In the wings last week, Tamar loudly disagreed, which seems to be the basis of their relationship.) Our first teary-eyed memorable-year story comes here, when Tamar describes nearly losing her husband, Vince, in 2012, when he developed multiple blood clots in his lungs and ended up in a coma. He was in the hospital for 40 days, and during that time, they decided to have a child. Three months later, she was pregnant, and now Tamar dances a rumba to her new song, which honors her husband and son. Vince accompanies the tune on piano. It\u2019s a typical Val rumba, with a lot of sweep and not a lot of breathing room between some of the moves. Nevertheless, it\u2019s beautiful, and you can tell how much Tamar feels the emotion, right through her body. She still goes dead in the eyes at times, which is OK for the hot-and-cold tango of last week but not the dance of love. Tamar is crying, and Carrie Ann is crying even harder as she thanks Tamar for her story and her dancing. Julianne praises the vulnerability and freedom Tamar displays and broadly hints she\u2019ll be giving Tamar a 9. Bruno says the connection was wired to perfection and appreciates the proper rumba, danced by the rules. It\u2019s official: Bruno has become former head judge Len Goodman. Tamar still can\u2019t compose herself backstage. Score: 27 (all 9s, including from, yes, Julianne). Vince comes back to embrace his wife.\n\nBefore we go into our next dance, we have a first on \u201cDWTS:\u201d a pro announcing her pregnancy. Congrats to Allison Holker and her husband, tWitch, and her daughter! Partner Andy Grammer has the best reply: \u201cThere\u2019s three of us now. We\u2019re the only ones with three.\u201d Trio dances every week!\n\nHayes Grier (2014) and Emma Slater, contemporary, \u201cStitches\u201d\n\nEmma is disappointed with the way Hayes was treated last week by the judges, remarking that he\u2019s only 15 years old. We hear about Hayes\u2019 older brother, Nash, and how he was the first brother to start with the whole Vine thing. The shy Hayes went from playing film crew to making his own videos to going on tours. Emma wants to put his evolving persona into this contemporary, which stars in near darkness before the lights begin to rise. Hayes does a surprisingly confident job lifting Emma \u2013 a skill that, as we\u2019ve seen as recently as this season, shouldn\u2019t be underplayed. This is the most relaxed he\u2019s been without being too floppy and gangly. Hayes and Emma come together so well. They tell a story, and as a choreographer, she clearly gets her partner. Julianne expresses shock that Hayes broke so strongly out of his shell. Bruno also is stunned at the technical breakthrough, with unexpected accents and shapes. For the first time, Carrie Ann sees nuance and storytelling. Score: 27 (another set of all 9s, and another set of shocked faces, this time from Hayes and Emma).\n\nJulianne looks back at 2007, when she joined \u201cDWTS\u201d and won on her first season, at just 18 years old. Julianne and Apolo Anton Ohno are one of my favorite couples of all time.\n\nAlek Skarlatos (2015) and Lindsay Arnold, paso doble, \u201cWake Me Up\u201d\n\nAlek\u2019s initial interview was conducted prior to Thursday\u2019s tragedy. He and his friends revisit the crucial moments in Paris, and we see bloody footage from the train. Alek had been deployed in Afghanistan at the start of the year and had looked forward to re-enrolling in college before the Paris attacks and ensuing fame. Then we see him learn about the Umpqua Community College shootings during \u201cDWTS\u201d rehearsal and how shaken he is as he struggles to find his friends. He feels a need to go home, and Lindsay encourages him to bring his upset feelings into the routine. Alek looks disconnected until the song hits the chorus, and then it\u2019s as if someone placed a fire under him. The energy level of the dance goes up, and the confidence and manliness of the paso appear. He has some unexpectedly strong yet graceful twisty turns. (Julianne also likes this.) But then the spark fades again as the paso reaches the end. Bruno likes the technique but suggests that if Alek does another paso, he needs to push his hips forward. Carrie Ann thinks the dance was strong and sturdy, if not the most expressive. Julianne appreciates the technique but asks to see more emotion and the expression in any routine Alek performs. Score: 24 (Carrie Ann 8, Julianne 8, Bruno 8).\n\nNick Carter (1992) and Sharna Burgess, jazz, \u201cEverybody (Backstreet\u2019s Back)\u201d\n\nBSB lovers, rejoice: Nick is rolling out one of his group\u2019s most famous songs on memorable-year week. (Actually, if you\u2019re a fan of late 1990s and early 2000s boy bands, Monday is nirvana in the ballroom. But where is season 2 winner and 98 Degrees member Drew Lachey?) We are treated to footage of then-12-year-old Nick still going through puberty and his bandmates talking about the new young member in their midst. Brian Littrell hasn\u2019t aged at all. Nick looks back at his dysfunctional family and is saddened because he never had the movie mom and dad. We get several shots of the \u201cDWTS\u201d crowd, which means we don\u2019t get as much Nick and Sharna dancing jazz. Yes, Nick is lip synching. This is basically a music video and concert, and probably a dream come true for BSB fan Sharna, but jazz? Is breakdancing jazz? Nick moves better than he did in his BSB peak days, so the ballroom training is clearly paying off. Carrie Ann and Julianne are fan girls, and Bruno yells about a mega-sexy-dancing hit. Score: 27 (another round of three 9s).\n\nCarlos PenaVega (2012) and Witney Carson, Viennese waltz, \u201cAmazing Grace\u201d\n\nFirst off, congrats to the newly engaged Witney! In 2012, Carlos came home from touring with Big Time Rush and succumbed to weed and darkness until he found religion. He walked into church on a Sunday to seek change and transformation. He was invited to a Bible study that Thursday \u2013 and met wife Alexa. As Carlos tells his story, we listen to Witney in rehearsal describing how she wants to tell that tale through the dancing. His burdens cripple him at the start, and when Witney approaches him, the early moves seem more contemporary than Viennese waltz. When Carlos rises, though, so does the dance. He uses the floor and dances big, just as Carrie Ann has been encouraging him to do. Julianne thanks Carlos and Witney for sharing their emotion. However, he\u2019s stuck in the middle of the pack, and he won\u2019t improve until he fixes his shoulders, she says. Bruno was transfixed with the performance; he thinks Carlos still has to work on his technique. Carrie Ann basically ignores the arm problems because she\u2019s so happy Carlos danced from his soul. Score: 25 (Carrie Ann 9, Julianne 8, Bruno 8).\n\nCarrie Ann looks back at 1993, when she toured the world with Madonna on the Girlie Show. Never mind Bruno in Spandex \u2013 those were Carrie Ann\u2019s boobs covered with a black bar. Yikes!\n\nPaula Deen (1989) and Louis Van Amstel, cha-cha, \u201cRespect\u201d\n\nIn 1989, Paula \u201cgot sick and tired of being sick and tired\u201d of being in a 26-year marriage that didn\u2019t benefit either partner. She got a divorce and began the Bag Lady business. Louis wants her to focus on what she wants to achieve, not on preventing a mishap, when dancing. Again, Paula struggles in rehearsal with trust and self-confidence. Paula is singing along more than she\u2019s moving along. There are a lot of pauses in this cha-cha, and although they\u2019re in time with the music, this means she isn\u2019t dancing. The cameras film about a third of this routine from above, making it even more difficult to judge the routine from home. Hey, she went wrong only once, Bruno says. Now have more fun! Carrie Ann calls Paula\u2019s moves hot and sexy \u2013 if only she didn\u2019t lose focus. She also clearly takes both feet off the floor at one point, but somehow, Carrie Ann won\u2019t ding her for this. Julianne also lectures Paula about her confidence levels. Paula tells Erin she\u2019d rather do her own moves than the actual steps. Score: 18 (6+6+6). Erin encourages Paula to whip her hair back and forth. This confuses Paula, and she does some kind of strange head jerking.\n\nAndy Grammer (2009) and Allison Holker, cha-cha, \u201cGood to Be Alive\u201d\n\nMore than once, Andy has cited his late mother as his inspiration for doing \u201cDWTS,\u201d and this week, he honors her most directly. In 2009, as he was a street performer in L.A., he learned his mother had late-stage breast cancer, and he had only days to say farewell. After her death, he was dazed and devastated until he wrote himself a pick-me-up song that changed his career: \u201cKeep Your Head Up.\u201d However, it\u2019s his new single, the equally optimistic \u201cGood to Be Alive,\u201d to which he will cha-cha. Allison is dancing at a different speed than Andy, which is distracting. Like Paula, he\u2019s more focused on singing and having a good time than dancing. When he\u2019s spinning Allison, he\u2019s too far apart from her, and he has to extend too much to make the move work. He\u2019s gawky and disjointed in his moves. Holy heck, Allison tells Alfonso that if she and Andy make the finals, she\u2019ll be six months pregnant. Carrie Ann still thinks Andy is awkward; Julianne disagrees and believes Andy was the most comfortable since week 1. Bruno sides with Julianne. Score: 23 (Carrie Ann 7, Julianne 8, Bruno 8).\n\nBindi Irwin (2006) and Derek Hough, contemporary, \u201cEvery Breath You Take\u201d\n\nThis is probably wrong to write, but \u2026I\u2019m sure the idea of Bindi\u2019s father watching her with every breath she takes is comforting. It\u2019s just that Sting himself, the man who wrote the song, said it\u2019s about obsession. Anyway\u2026 It\u2019s been nine years since Steve Irwin passed away, and Bindi is ready to tell the story of wanting to be just like her wildlife-conservationist father. We get footage of 9-year-old Bindi reading a speech at the Australia Zoo at his memorial service. She was so upbeat then, but this week, we\u2019re seeing tears for the first time.This is a fantastic, heartfelt routine, gentle and balletic in spots. The way Bindi leaps and skips after Derek is the way she probably moved around with her father at one point. For the final move, they incorporate one of Bindi\u2019s memories of holding her father\u2019s finger. Bindi weeps as she talks to Alfonso. Julianne had her breath taken away, and Carrie Ann and Bruno also are verklempt. Score: 28 (Carrie Ann 9, Julianne 9, Bruno 10 \u2013 the first 10 of the season).\n\nReaders, what did you think of this week\u2019s elimination?
