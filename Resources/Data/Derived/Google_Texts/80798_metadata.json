This is a bitter harvest.\u201d\n\n\u201cTraditionally, satire has comforted the afflicted while afflicting the comfortable. Satire punches up, against authority of all kinds, the little guy against the powerful. Great French satirists like Moli\u00e8re and Daumier always punched up, holding up the self-satisfied and hypocritical to ridicule. Ridiculing the non-privileged is almost never funny \u2014 it\u2019s just mean.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy punching downward, by attacking a powerless, disenfranchised minority with crude, vulgar drawings closer to graffiti than cartoons, Charlie wandered into the realm of hate speech, which in France is only illegal if it directly incites violence. Well, voila \u2014 the 7 million copies that were published following the killings did exactly that, triggering violent protests across the Muslim world, including one in Niger, in which ten people died. Meanwhile, the French government kept busy rounding up and arresting over 100 Muslims who had foolishly used their freedom of speech to express their support of the attacks.\u201d\n\nTrudeau has it all wrong. Satire, and great editorial cartoons, are about speaking truth to power \u2014 and the most powerful people are those with guns, enforcing their will through violence. Trudeau seems blind to the threats that the Charlie Hebdo cartoonists saw all around them as Islamic extremists continue raping, enslaving and killing thousands of innocents while threatening to murder even more cartoonists.\n\nEditorial cartoonists work in comfortable safety in America, but around the world our profession has always been dangerous. Cartoonists are murdered, beaten and jailed by the powerful people with guns, who the cartoonists criticize. Editorial cartoonists outside of the U.S. are the bravest heroes of journalism.\n\nNo personal bravery is required of editorial cartoonists in the U.S., where the government we lampoon defends us against the dangers faced by our cartoonist colleagues overseas. It takes no bravery to blame a rape victim for her own rape, as it takes no bravery to blame a cartoonist for his own murder. Perhaps the rape victim wore a provocative dress, or the cartoonist drew a provocative cartoon, it shouldn\u2019t matter. It is the violence that should be condemned, not the victim of the violence.\n\nTrudeau\u2019s cartoons don\u2019t \u201ccomfort the afflicted while afflicting the comfortable;\u201d Trudeau simply chooses targets that he feels comfortable afflicting \u2014 targets that don\u2019t shoot back.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://wdhne.ws/1GrTeHZ", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "The Doonesbury creator has it all wrong in his speech about satire, cartoons and blame.", "og": {"site_name": "Daily Herald Media", "description": "The Doonesbury creator has it all wrong in his speech about satire, cartoons and blame.", "title": "In speech, Garry Trudeau blames Charlie Hebdo victims", "url": "http://www.wausaudailyherald.com/story/opinion/columnists/2015/04/25/speech-garry-trudeau-blames-charlie-hebdo-victims/26325935/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/wausaudailyherald.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Doonesbury creator has it all wrong in his speech about satire, cartoons and blame.", "creator": "@wausauherald", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/fb1182acc6450ca13a28d2eaba8230fcafacfc5a/c=500-0-2700-2200&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Wausau/2015/04/24/B9317105685Z.1_20150424174953_000_G0GAJLSUF.1-0.jpg", "title": "In speech, Garry Trudeau blames Charlie Hebdo victims", "site": "@wausauherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=884268453", "fb": {"app_id": 187427251271455}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb014\"", "article_summary": "The Doonesbury creator has it all wrong in his speech about satire, cartoons and blame.\nPerhaps the rape victim wore a provocative dress, or the cartoonist drew a provocative cartoon, it shouldn\u2019t matter.\nTrudeau\u2019s cartoons don\u2019t \u201ccomfort the afflicted while afflicting the comfortable;\u201d Trudeau simply chooses targets that he feels comfortable afflicting \u2014 targets that don\u2019t shoot back.\nIt takes no bravery to blame a rape victim for her own rape, as it takes no bravery to blame a cartoonist for his own murder.\nTrudeau seems blind to the threats that the Charlie Hebdo cartoonists saw all around them as Islamic extremists continue raping, enslaving and killing thousands of innocents while threatening to murder even more cartoonists."}
