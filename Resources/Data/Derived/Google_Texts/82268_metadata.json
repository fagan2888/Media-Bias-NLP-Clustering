Paul LePage wants the nation\u2019s highest court to rule on whether Maine can remove about 6,000 young Mainers from the state\u2019s Medicaid rolls.\n\nLePage filed a request with the U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday, asking the court to reverse a November decision by the 1st Circuit Court of Appeals, which ruled against the governor.\n\nMedicaid coverage for the young Mainers in question has remained intact during the legal battle between state and federal government.\n\nIn 2012, the state sought to drop nondisabled 19- and 20-year-olds from the government-funded health plan. But the federal government denied the request, citing provision of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, which requires states to maintain the same eligibility requirements in place in 2010 until 2019.\n\nIn 2010, Maine was still providing coverage to low-income 19- and 20-year-olds. The Republican-controlled Legislature approved the plan to end coverage for those young adults, which was estimated to save $3.7 million in state funds and $6.9 million in federal matching funds.\n\nThe federal government held that such a change in Maine\u2019s Medicaid law would violate the maintenance of effort provision of the Affordable Care Act and threatened the state with elimination of all Medicaid funding.\n\nLePage\u2019s administration claims the feds are forcing Maine\u2019s hand with an unfunded mandate, and that the maintenance of effort provision exceeds Congress\u2019 authority to direct spending and violates Maine\u2019s sovereignty.\n\n\u201cWe are asking the Supreme Court to review this case because we firmly believe that Maine is on the right path, toward fiscal responsibility and prosperity for all, and the federal government\u2019s path of reckless welfare spending is one that we decline to pursue,\u201d wrote Maine Department of Health and Human Services Commissioner Mary Mayhew.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court only hears about 2 percent of the cases it\u2019s asked to review, according to the court\u2019s own estimation.\n\nFollow Mario Moretto on Twitter at @riocarmine.", "article_metadata": {"description": "AUGUSTA, Maine \u2014 Gov.
