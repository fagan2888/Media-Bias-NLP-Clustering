The 2008 regulation requires the state government to recover Medicaid DSH payments found by auditors to be in excess of hospital-specific limits starting in 2011, with collected money due either to other state hospitals or back to the federal government.\n\nStates were instructed to ensure that DSH payments to each hospital do not surpass a hospital\u2019s total annual uncompensated care costs, defined as inpatient and outpatient costs for Medicaid-eligible individuals and individuals with no third-party coverage, minus payments from Medicaid FFS, Medicaid managed care, supplemental allocations, uninsured patients and the Section 1011 program funding emergency services for undocumented immigrants.\n\nHospitals did not sue until after CMS released an update to the regulation in 2011, changing the formula for calculating DSH limits by adding the requirement that private insurance reimbursement be included in the tally of Medicaid payments \u2014 a factor sure to lower DSH allocations.\n\nHealthcare providers are on the cusp of overturning an expansive recalculation of DSH allocations. - Tweet this\n\nProviders said that CMS skipped over the federal government\u2019s legal duty in rule promulgation, because the addition of private insurance was made to the regulations \u2014 in an online update dubbed FAQ 33 \u2014 without going through notice and public comment as required under the Administrative Procedure Act. Moreover, they argued, the Medicaid Act amendments Congress enacted in 2003 didn\u2019t authorize any drastic change to the DSH program.\n\nThe federal judge hearing the case, Sullivan, agreed.\n\n\u201cThe Act does not include private insurance payments among those that are specifically enumerated as offsets,\u201d wrote Sullivan, the same judge who famously demanded the Internal Revenue Service to produce the much-contested emails related to alleged targeting of Tea Party political groups.\n\n\u201cAt most,\u201d he wrote, the changes as passed by Congress \u201cmight have delegated to the Secretary the ability to determine by regulation that additional payments should be considered. Even if the Secretary had such discretion, she did not exercise it in the 2008 Rule.\u201d\n\nSeattle and Texas Children\u2019s \u201care likely to succeed in arguing that FAQ 33 must be set aside as unlawful,\u201d Sullivan concluded. His order extends to all DSH eligible providers, prohibiting CMS \u201cfrom enforcing, applying, or implementing FAQ 33 pending further order.\u201d\n\nThe ruling could face appeal by the Department of Health and Human Services. In the interim, it leaves 2015 DSH payments uncertain for states.\n\n\u201cI believe this decision has far-reaching implications for the healthcare community, especially children\u2019s hospitals that treat a large share of critically ill Medicaid-eligible children,\u201d said Susan Feigin Harris, the BakerHostetler attorney representing Seattle and Texas Children\u2019s.\n\n\u201cThese are nonprofit institutions that treat children needing transplants, cancer patients, and premature newborns,\u201d she continued. \u201cEliminating their payments arbitrarily and recharacterizing private insurance payments as Medicaid payments should be vetted by Congress and the healthcare community, rather than slipped through a frequently asked question on a website.\u201d\n\nTwitter: @AnthonyBrino", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/healthcare-providers-score-challenge-disproportionate-share-recalculations", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/Seattle-Children%27s-Hospital-feature.gif", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "Lawyers for Seattle Children's Hospital and Texas Children's Hospital convinced a federal judge to temporarily block the enforcement of a Medicaid rule requiring private insurance reimbursement to be included in calculating their hospital-specific limits to these payments.", "title": "Healthcare providers score in challenge to disproportionate share recalculations"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/Seattle-Children%27s-Hospital-feature.gif"}, "description": "Lawyers for Seattle Children's Hospital and Texas Children's Hospital convinced a federal judge to temporarily block the enforcement of a Medicaid rule requiring private insurance reimbursement to be included in calculating their hospital-specific limits to these payments.", "site": "@HC_Finance", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Healthcare providers score in challenge to disproportionate share recalculations"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Healthcare providers are on the cusp of overturning an expansive recalculation of disproportionate share funding allocations, the latest in several reimbursement battles being waged with Medicare and Medicaid.", "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd30a9\"", "article_summary": "\u201cEliminating their payments arbitrarily and recharacterizing private insurance payments as Medicaid payments should be vetted by Congress and the healthcare community, rather than slipped through a frequently asked question on a website.\u201dTwitter: @AnthonyBrino\n[See also: Medicaid DSH cuts mean crisis for some hospitals.]\nIn the interim, it leaves 2015 DSH payments uncertain for states.\nHealthcare providers are on the cusp of overturning an expansive recalculation of DSH allocations.\nFor the time being, Texas Children\u2019s is avoiding repayment of $21 million, and Seattle Children\u2019s is keeping $7 million, in clawbacks from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services going back to 2011."}
