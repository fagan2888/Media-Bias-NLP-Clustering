Another teaser for the extra-long five minute clip of "ABC's of disease".

Like catch it now, this centers around the story of a school musical, led by Forrest Kline, frontman of powerpop band HelloGoodbye. They're adorbs. And it's a bit of a walk for the point.

The ABCs of Disease is a creative extension of WellPointâ€™s Real Health campaign, a full scale digital & social initiative aimed at simplifying and educating Americans around the often complex landscape of healthcare and insurance, particularly on the heels of the Affordable Care Act. In addition to the long form video, the full-scale campaign also includes a range of elements from short form pre-roll spots and bite-sized video content to the website, which serves as the digital conversation hub.
