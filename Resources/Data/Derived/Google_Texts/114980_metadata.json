John Campbell outlined the challenges facing coalition and Afghan forces and warned the situation could deteriorate should the U.S. not extend its commitment to the country.\n\n\u201cAfghanistan is at an inflection point,\u201d he said to the House Armed Services Committee. \u201cI believe if we do not make deliberate, measured adjustments, 2016 is at risk of being no better, and possibly worse, than 2015.\n\nRight now, President Obama plans to reduce the 9,800 U.S. troops in Afghanistan to 5,500 by the end of the year. But there are hints, such as Campbell\u2019s testimony, that the Pentagon will push Obama to change course.\n\nWhen asked for specifics on what further commitment the United States should make, Campbell demurred.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not as simple as I need X amount of people,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can have the force, but if you don\u2019t have the authorities, it doesn\u2019t make a difference. You can have the authorities, but if you don\u2019t have the resources to execute the authorities, it doesn\u2019t make a difference.\u201d\n\nThe mission is Afghanistan now is twofold: train, advice and assist Afghan forces and conduct counterterrorism operations.\n\nRep. Mac Thornberry (R-Texas), chairman of the committee, said he\u2019s concerned the U.S. mission in Afghanistan doesn\u2019t have the resources it needs to succeed.\n\n\u201cIt just says to me as a matter of common sense that when we go from 852 installations to 20, that it is harder to keep up with the enemy and to prevent another attack on our homeland,\u201d Thornberry said.\n\nAmong the more recent negative developments, six U.S. airmen and a Special Forces soldier were killed. Also, a group of Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) loyalists is gaining strength. The Taliban has been resurgent, and al Qaeda remains a threat despite its weakened state.\n\nOf the 407 district centers in Afghanistan, Campbell said, eight are under insurgent control, 18 are under insurgent influence and up to 94 district centers are \u201cat risk.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese figures make two clear points,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cOne, that approximately 70 percent of the inhabited parts of Afghanistan are either under government influence or government control, and two, the importance of prioritizing Afghan resources to ensure key district centers do not fall into insurgent influence or control.\u201d\n\nRight now, NATO is crafting a five-year plan for involvement in Afghanistan, which Campbell said he believes the United States should also do.\n\nThe Afghan government wants that commitment, Campbell added.\n\n\u201cMany of the Afghan security forces want large numbers,\u201d he said. \u201cThey want more resources. They understand they have gaps and seams they need to continue to work on, and they see NATO and especially the United States as the only one that can really help them get to the level they need.\u201d\n\nWhen pressed on how long an economic commitment the United States should make, Campbell said he doesn\u2019t foresee Afghanistan being able to fully defend itself until 2024.\n\nIn terms of necessary military commitment, he said he wouldn\u2019t compare it to South Korea or Germany as some have. That\u2019s because, he said, the U.S. left thousands more troops in those countries than being talked about for Afghanistan.\n\nStill, some committee members expressed wariness that the mission in Afghanistan continues to drag on.\n\n\u201cWill the job ever be done,\u201d asked Rep. Jackie Speier (D-Calif.) \u201cDo we have to accept the fact that we are there indefinitely?\u201d", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Gen.
