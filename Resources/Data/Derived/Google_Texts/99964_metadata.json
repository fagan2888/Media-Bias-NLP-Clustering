For the first time ever, some upper-income taxpayers will have to pay the 3.8% surtax on their 2013 income tax returns. This could be a harrowing experience for some of your clients.\n\nThe NII surtax \u2013 which was authorized by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (aka \u201cObamacare\u201d) -- is computed on new Form 8960 (Net Investment Income Tax\u2014 Individuals, Estates, and Trusts). The IRS finalized the form just a few scant days before the 2014 tax filing season officially kicked off on January 31.\n\nHere\u2019s how it works: The 3.8% surtax applies to the lesser of a taxpayer\u2019s NII or the excess modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) above an annual threshold. The threshold is $200,000 for single filers, heads of household and qualifying widow(er)s; $250,000 for joint filers; and $125,000 for married couples filing separately. In addition, the surtax is owed by trusts and estates if NII exceeds the upper dollar threshold for the top 39.6% bracket. For 2013 returns, the dollar threshold is $11,950.\n\nIns and Outs of the NII Surtax\n\nMuch of the confusion about the surtax centers on the definition of NII. This covers most income items, including:\n\nCapital gains from the sale of stocks, bonds and mutual fund;\n\nInterest and dividends;\n\nRent and royalties;\n\nGains from investments in passive activities; and\n\nNet capital gain from the sale of property other than property held in an active trade or business.\n\nConversely, the following income items are specifically excluded from the definition of NII:\n\nWages and self-employment income;\n\nDistributions from qualified retirement plans and IRAS;\n\nTaxable Social Security income;\n\nActive trade or business income;\n\nGain on the sale of active interests in partnerships, S corporations or limited liability companies;\n\nIncome from tax-exempt municipal bonds; and\n\nCapital gain statutorily excluded from tax on the sale of a principal residence.\n\nTo arrive at NII, gross investment income is reduced by deductions that are properly allocable to income items. This includes the following:\n\nInvestment interest expenses;\n\nInvestment advisory and brokerage fees;\n\nExpenses related to rental and royalty income;\n\nTax preparation fees;\n\nSate and local income taxes; and\n\nFiduciary expenses for estates and trusts.\n\n4 Examples of the NII Tax Rules\n\nOne noteworthy point is that income items that are excluded from NII may still trigger or increase liability for the surtax because they increase MAGI. Thus, some of your clients might be surprised to learn that they owe the surtax this year, while others could escape unscathed.\n\nExample 1: Mary, a single filer, earned $175,000 in wages in 2013 and realized $15,000 in capital gains and dividends. Her MAGI was $190,000. As a result, she doesn\u2019t have to pay the surtax. Reason: Her MAGI is below the $200,000 threshold, so the lesser of her NII and excess MAGI is zero.\n\nExample 2: John, a single filer, earned $225,000 in wages in 2013 and realized $10,000 in municipal bond income. His MAGI was $225,000. As a result, he doesn\u2019t have to pay the surtax. Reason: He has no NII, so the lesser of his NII and excess MAGI is zero.\n\nExample 3: Sally and Jim, joint filers, had a total of $300,00 in wages in 2013 and realized $25,000 in capital gains and dividends. Their MAGI was $325,000. As a result, the couple must pay a surtax of $950 (3.8% of $25,000). Reason: The NII of $25,000 is the lesser of their NII and excess MAGI of $75,000.\n\nExample 4: Rob and Susan, joint filers, had a total of $200,000 of wages in 2013 and realized $50,000 in capital gains and dividends. Their MAGI was $280,000 because Rob also received an IRA distribution of $30,000. As a result, the couple must pay a surtax of $1,140 (3,8% of $30,000). Reason: The excess MAGI of $30,000 is the lesser of their NII of $50,000 and excess MAGI.\n\nIf you need assistance on NII tax calculations, there\u2019s a wealth of information available at www.irs.gov and numerous other sites online.
