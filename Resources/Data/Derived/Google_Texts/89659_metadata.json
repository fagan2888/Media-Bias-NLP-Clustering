Casey said he was spending an estimated $2,600 each month for himself, his wife and two children.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t stand up and say [the Affordable Care Act] is a perfect law, but we needed something like it,\u201d Casey said.\n\n\u201cThis year, the Casey family\u2019s premiums will fall from over $30,000 to under $9,000,\u201d Obama said from the White House Rose Garden.\n\nCasey was at the Vista Courthouse for jury duty when he received a voicemail from a White House representative informing him the President may use his story in his healthcare speech. In January of this year, Casey sent an e-mail to the White House, praising Obamacare for lowering his premiums.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018well somebody should say a good story [about Obamacare] because I consider it a good thing since it\u2019s making a big difference for me,\u2019\u201d Casey said.\n\nCasey originally thought the White House might use his e-mail as an example on the White House blog. So he had been checking until he got the voicemail Tuesday.\n\nDuring his lunch break, he heard a portion of President Obama\u2019s speech. \u201cWell, when I heard my name, I said, \u2018That\u2019s me!\u2019 There weren\u2019t a whole lot of people in the jury room but they ignored me completely. So I got out my phone and started texting people saying the President just mentioned my name,\u201d Casey said.\n\nCasey\u2019s friends and family have been contacting him since the speech, asking how the President got his name. Everyone, including his family were thrilled President Obama made an example out of them.\n\n\u201cIt was kind of an interesting day. I\u2019m not sure I want to have days like this every day,\u201d Casey said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "SOLANA BEACH, Calif. - President Barack Obama addressed the nation on his Affordable Care Act victory Tuesday and his first success story was about Sean Casey from Solana Beach.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "FOX5 San Diego - San Diego News, Weather, Traffic and Sports | KSWB", "description": "SOLANA BEACH, Calif. \u2013 President Barack Obama addressed the nation on his Affordable Care Act victory Tuesday and his first success story was about Sean Casey from Solana Beach.
