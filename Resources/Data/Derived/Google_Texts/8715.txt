From Jonathan Easely writing at The Hill:

Donald Trump has reached a new high in the race for the Republican presidential nomination.

According to a Monmouth University survey released on Thursday, Trump takes 30 percent support nationally, a four-point gain over the same survey from before the first GOP debate.

Ben Carson is a distant second place in the poll, taking 18 percent support. The retired neurosurgeon has risen sharply in the polls over the past month. He was at only 5 percent support in the same poll from early August.

The rest of the Republican field isnâ€™t even in the same ballpark.
