Gov. Bobby Jindal, a fellow Republican, has called on him to step down, and the state Republican chairman labeled him \u201can example of why ordinary people are fed up with politics.\u201d\n\nAs Mr. McAllister, an outsider in his first term, dropped from sight and hunkered down, presumably in his home near here in northeast Louisiana, he has resisted the calls to quit and told a local newspaper that he would let voters decide his fate in November.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nEven as it is unclear if he can survive so long, the texture of Mr. McAllister\u2019s unusual political story has grown more piquant, revealing an estrangement from the Republican establishment, the racial politics of a poor district and voters who feel caught between deep disappointment and an impulse to forgive.\n\nA number of voters here identified a double standard in the Republican state leadership for denouncing Mr. McAllister but issuing no such rebuke to Senator David Vitter during a 2007 prostitution scandal. Mr. Vitter apologized for \u201ca very serious sin in my past\u201d and said he had asked for and received forgiveness from his wife and from God. He was re-elected to the Senate in 2010 and is considered as a favorite to succeed Mr. Jindal in the 2015 governor\u2019s race.\n\nMs. Edmondson said the place to judge Mr. McAllister would be at the ballot box. \u201cIf Jindal is going to ask him to resign, why is it not right for David Vitter to resign?\u201d she said.\n\nIn his only statement since the scandal broke last Monday, Mr. McAllister, 40, said he was seeking the forgiveness of his wife, Kelly, and their five children, who were featured in a campaign ad last year that showed the family around the breakfast table before a Sunday church service.\n\nMr. McAllister was exposed by a surveillance video from his district office in Monroe that appeared on the website of The Ouachita Citizen, a weekly newspaper. In the grainy scene, he embraces a woman \u2014 identified as Melissa Peacock, an aide on his staff and the wife of a political supporter and longtime friend. Ms. Peacock left the congressman\u2019s staff the weekend before the video surfaced.\n\nHer husband told CNN he was \u201cdevastated by the whole deal.\u201d\n\nIn his one interview since the scandal, Mr. McAllister told The News-Star of Monroe that Ms. Peacock was his first infidelity in 16 years of marriage and that he had confessed to his wife in January or February, about a month after the video was recorded.\n\nPhoto\n\nPolitical circles in Louisiana are rife with speculation over who leaked the video, with theories swirling around those loyal to the Republican establishment. Mr. McAllister won his seat in a 20-point landslide, defeating the handpicked candidate of party leaders in a special election. He succeeded Rodney Alexander, who stepped down with a year left in office to become secretary of veterans affairs in the Jindal administration.\n\n\u201cIt reeks of old-time back-room Louisiana political high jinks,\u201d said Bob Mann, a professor at Louisiana State University and former senior aide to Democratic senators and a governor. He added he had no evidence Republican enemies were behind the leak.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA self-made businessman with no political experience, Mr. McAllister won his rural district, one of the largest and poorest in the state, by forming an unusual coalition of socially conservative Republicans, blacks \u2014 and fans of \u201cDuck Dynasty.\u201d Phil Robertson of the reality show, which is set in and around West Monroe, recorded ads supporting \u201cmy good friend Vance McAllister.\u201d\n\nThe endorsement \u201cvalidated him culturally\u201d as an unknown in a region where gun rights and evangelical Christianity are the bedrock, said Karen Haymon, an aide to a Republican rival in a 13-way open primary.\n\nIn defiance of Governor Jindal, Mr. McAllister supported an expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, calling it justified by the high poverty rate in northeast Louisiana. In a district that is 34 percent African-American, Mr. McAllister, who is white, won four out of five black votes, said Mayor Jamie Mayo of Monroe, who supported him.\n\nMany black voters are still behind him, including Lawrence Atkins, a retired engineer. \u201cPeople make mistakes, but at the end of day, I support his political agenda,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the end of the day, I want people to get the job done.\u201d\n\nMayor Mayo said, \u201cThe African-American community knows that people deserve more chances.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot that you condone what he did,\u201d he added. \u201cNone of us condone it. But I don\u2019t hear strong thoughts in the African-American community against the congressman.\u201d\n\nLouisiana voters have a long history of overlooking politicians with elastic morals, re-electing Edwin Edwards four times as governor, despite repeated investigations and longstanding allegations of dubious ethics, before he went to prison for eight years on corruption charges.\n\nIn Washington, Mr. McAllister remains unknown and with few allies. He has worn his outsider status proudly, telling a Louisiana chamber of commerce he hopes to never get comfortable. House Speaker John A. Boehner said last week Mr. McAllister \u201chas decisions he has to make.\u201d\n\nIt is clear he has lost much support at home. On a sunny Saturday, shoppers in downtown Monroe and West Monroe, which face each other across the Ouachita River, expressed anger and disappointment.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cOur community is known for Christian values,\u201d said Failine Waggoner, the mother of a 2-year-old. \u201cWe were so proud to be sending to Washington someone representing us in that way. He let us down.\u201d\n\nPete Toms, a construction supervisor, said he voted for Mr. McAllister because of the \u201cDuck Dynasty\u201d endorsement, and feels betrayed. \u201cIt feels like he took my vote and wasted it,\u201d he said.\n\nBob Dziadaszek, strolling the RiverMarket in Monroe, had blunt advice for Mr. McAllister: \u201cI think he should man up and step down.\u201d",
