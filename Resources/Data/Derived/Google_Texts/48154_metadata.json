HHS believes some 19 million Americans earn too much for Medicaid but qualify for ObamaCare subsidies and haven\u2019t signed up. Some 8.5 million of that 19 million purchase off-exchange private coverage with their own money, while the other 10.5 million are still uninsured. In other words, for every person who\u2019s allowed to join and has, two people haven\u2019t.\n\nAmong this population of the uninsured, HHS reports that half are between the ages of 18 and 34 and nearly two-thirds are in excellent or very good health.
