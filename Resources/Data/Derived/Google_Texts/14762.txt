Reason's Elizabeth Nolan Brown wrote this week about the prosecution of a Montana man who posted anti-Semitic and Holocaust-denying Twitter rants. Brown wrote:

The only permitted exceptions to free speech protections—as the Supreme Court recently re-articulated—are for obscenity, defamation, fraud, incitement, and "speech integral to criminal conduct."

"It's not fun when you're walking around policing jokes all day long, it's not an attractive pose to people," continues Welch.
