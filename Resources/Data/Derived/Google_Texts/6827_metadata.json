Roger Wolsey, who directs the Wesley Foundation at the University of Colorado at Boulder, said that some say that \"homeless people are scary and dangerous,\" but \"it seems to me that being homeless is what's scary and dangerous.\"\n\nThe leading cause of homelessness, Wolsey said, is a lack of affordable housing, but \"we can step forward and make that happen.\"\n\nSaid Pastor Daniel Rutty of the Reverence Movement: \"Many of us here today are not homeless,\" but homelessness \"is a burden we can take up for them.\"\n\nRutty thanked the volunteers and organizations represented at Saturday's memorial service \"for taking a piece of that cross\" upon themselves.\n\nThe city of Boulder's Human Relations Commission was another sponsor of the service, and City Council member Lisa Morzel read a proclamation, declaring Saturday to be National Homeless Person Memorial Day in Boulder.\n\n\"We wish peace for their souls in eternity,\" Morzel said, adding that the holiday season offers and opportunity to affirm and renew commitments to end homelessness.\n\nHomeless advocate Joy Redstone said that while \"not all deaths are preventable,\" more can be done to save at least some people's lives. She urged the service-goers to help the community \"find the compassion and the commitment to bring year-round shelter to Boulder.\"\n\nAt the conclusion of the hour-long service, Redstone said: \"I can't help but hope that we're not here next year.\"\n\nJohn Fryar: 303-684-5211, jfryar@times-call.com or twitter.com/jfryartc", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.timescall.com/longmont-local-news/ci_27178801/boulders-homeless-deaths-marked-somber-memorial-service", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2014/1220/20141220__21TCAHOMw~3_300.jpg", "sailthru.author": "By John Fryar \n \n  Times-Call staff writer", "description": "More than 100 people gathered at Boulder's Glen Huntington Bandshell  for a Saturday morning memorial service for more than 20 homeless people who have died in Boulder during the past year.", "ag": {"canon": "LongmontTimes-Call:article:27178801:view"}, "startDate": "2014-12-20T15:41:54-0700", "og": {"url": "http://www.timescall.com/longmont-local-news/ci_27178801/boulders-homeless-deaths-marked-somber-memorial-service", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2014/1220/20141220__21TCAHOMw~1.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "More than 100 people gathered at Boulder's Glen Huntington Bandshell  for a Saturday morning memorial service for more than 20 homeless people who have died in Boulder during the past year.", "title": "Boulder's homeless deaths marked with somber memorial service"}, "twitter": {"domain": "timescall.com", "description": "More than 100 people gathered at Boulder's Glen Huntington Bandshell  for a Saturday morning memorial service for more than 20 homeless people who have died in Boulder during the past year.", "title": "Boulder's homeless deaths marked with somber memorial service", "url": "http://www.timescall.com/longmont-local-news/ci_27178801/boulders-homeless-deaths-marked-somber-memorial-service", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2014/1220/20141220__21TCAHOMw~1.jpg", "site": "@TimesCall", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-12-20T15:41:54-0700", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "sailthru.title": "Boulder's homeless deaths marked with somber memorial service", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2014/1220/20141220__21TCAHOMw~3.jpg", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Local News", "google-site-verification": "lLtD9ZooxmJUEEdRSCVzkO06t_hYKtyDqZF7EA3N2U0", "modificationDate": "2014-12-20T15:47:43-0700", "endDate": "2024-12-20T15:40:47-0700", "byline": "By John FryarTimes-Call", "sailthru.site": "timescall.com", "pubDate": "2014-12-20T15:44:30-0700", "news_keywords": "Longmont Colorado TimesCall local news"}, "article_summary": "Rutty thanked the volunteers and organizations represented at Saturday's memorial service \"for taking a piece of that cross\" upon themselves.\nDuring Saturday's memorial service, Sease read aloud the names of 24 homeless people who died in Boulder during the past 12 months, including eight who died outdoors.\nAlso recognized was Gene Culbertson, the founder of the START Homeless Day Resource Center in Boulder, who died in August.\nIsabel McDevitt, Bridge House's executive director, said she didn't look on Saturday's remembrance of the 24 deceased Boulder homeless persons \"as a closing.\n'A burden we can take up for them'More than 100 people gathered at Boulder's Glen Huntington Bandshell for a Saturday morning memorial service for more than 20 homeless people who have died in Boulder during the past year."}
