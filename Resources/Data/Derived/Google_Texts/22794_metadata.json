After climbing 20 percent since Jan. 31, prices will rise by another 20 cents this month because of refinery maintenance and unexpected outages, the nation\u2019s largest motoring group estimates.\n\nRefineries are operating at the lowest rate in six weeks, government data show. Fuel production may slow further as more plants shut for seasonal maintenance. Gasoline is also climbing as the panic in oil markets subsides, with volatility the lowest in three months. The gain threatens to reduce the windfall to U.S. drivers from last year\u2019s plunge.\n\n\u201cThe refinery problems led to increases in futures and wholesale prices,\u201d Andy Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC, an energy consulting firm in Houston, said by phone Thursday. \u201cGasoline doesn\u2019t go up and down with crude oil. The problems are more on the gasoline front.\u201d\n\nPump prices outpaced a 4 percent gain in U.S. benchmark crude since the end of January. West Coast gasoline jumped after an explosion at an Exxon Mobil Corp. refinery near Los Angeles, and East Coast supplies fell the most since October after upsets at plants near Philadelphia.\n\n\u201cGasoline prices are still expected to rise,\u201d Michael Green, an AAA spokesman, said by phone Thursday. \u201cBut we are not going to have a dramatic increase that could send prices above $3 a gallon.\u201d\n\nAmerican households are expected to save $750 each on lower gasoline costs in 2015 compared to 2014, the EIA said last month.\n\nRefinery Rates\n\nU.S. refiners operated at 86.6 percent of their capacity last week, the lowest level since Jan. 19, according to the Energy Information Administration.\n\nRefineries on the East Coast processed the least crude in more than two years as a cold blast swept through the region. Philadelphia Energy Solutions put the restart of a fluid catalytic cracker on hold for a week before introducing feed to the unit Thursday, according to a person familiar with plant operations.\n\nExxon had an explosion Feb. 18 at its Torrance refinery in Southern California that damaged and shut several units. Tesoro Corp.\u2019s Golden Eagle plant near San Francisco is expected to remain idled for another week for maintenance. The site was partially shut for repairs when United Steelworkers began striking on Feb. 1, and the company shut all other units after the walkout.\n\nRetail gasoline on the West Coast rose a record 37.2 cents a gallon to $3.13 in the week through March 2, EIA data show.\n\nSeasonal Issues\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the normal confluence of seasonal refinery issues,\u201d said Patrick DeHaan, a senior petroleum analyst at GasBuddy Organization Inc., said by phone. \u201cIt\u2019s being enhanced in some areas of the country. On the West Coast, the refinery explosion is making more of an impact.\u201d\n\nRefinery outages are reducing gasoline supplies just as demand is rising. Stockpiles in the East Coast, known as PADD 1, dropped to 67.6 million barrels last week, the lowest level since Jan. 23, according to the EIA. Production decreased to 9.52 million barrels a day, down 1.4 percent from the previous week.\n\nGasoline\u2019s gain came as crude oil is at the least volatile level this year. The CBOE Crude Oil Volatility Index dropped to 47.09 Thursday, the lowest level since Dec. 11. Gasoline for April delivery on Nymex was $29.28 a barrel over WTI Friday, $5 above the five-year average for this time of year.\n\nWhen refiners return from maintenance, they will begin to adjust their gasoline production, said Lipow. High margins may encourage them to run their operations \u201cas much as they can.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Gasoline is rising five times faster than crude oil as refinery shutdowns limit supplies.", "language": "english", "author": "WITN", "og": {"url": "http://www.witn.com/home/headlines/Gas-pump-prices-rising-5-times-faster-than-crude-oil-in-US-295465961.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/gas+prices93.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Gasoline is rising five times faster than crude oil as refinery shutdowns limit supplies.", "title": "Gas pump prices rising 5 times faster than crude oil in U.S."}, "twitter": {"description": "Gasoline is rising five times faster than crude oil as refinery shutdowns limit supplies.", "title": "Gas pump prices rising 5 times faster than crude oil in U.S.", "url": "http://www.witn.com/home/headlines/Gas-pump-prices-rising-5-times-faster-than-crude-oil-in-US-295465961.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/gas+prices93.jpg", "creator": "@WITN", "site": "@WITN", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "Gas pump prices rising 5 times faster than crude oil in U.S.", "fb": {"app_id": 100653909772, "pages": 45809529741}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "google-site-verification": "SAIlGc4W5cz6VdYh4YTfTRgDO0fVlzEwt0FUQF1Qp3g", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Gas pump prices rising 5, times faster than crude oil"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe12e5\"", "article_summary": "Gasoline is rising five times faster than crude oil as refinery shutdowns limit supplies.\nThe CBOE Crude Oil Volatility Index dropped to 47.09 Thursday, the lowest level since Dec. 11.\n\u201cGasoline prices are still expected to rise,\u201d Michael Green, an AAA spokesman, said by phone Thursday.\nGasoline\u2019s gain came as crude oil is at the least volatile level this year.\n\u201cGasoline doesn\u2019t go up and down with crude oil."}
