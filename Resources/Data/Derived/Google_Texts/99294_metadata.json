Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. Republicans so far have a wide open prospective field that includes Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas, Rand Paul of Kentucky and Marco Rubio of Florida; former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and even Romney, the 2012 nominee.\n\nLevin noted the significance of the midterm elections to the just-announced resignation of U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder.\n\n>>> 6 Years of Eric Holder in 1 Timeline\n\nThe radio host said he fears that should Republicans win the Senate \u2014 the party needs to net only six seats to do so \u2014 Senate Democrats will \u201cram through\u201d confirmation of Holder\u2019s successor during the post-election lame duck session.\n\n\u201cRepublicans can\u2019t do anything to derail that,\u201d Levin said.\n\nHolder, in announcing his resignation Thursday, said he would remain until his replacement wins confirmation.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Talk radio's \"Great One\" wants to confound what he calls the Republican establishment's habit of tripping up conservative candidates for president.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Talk radio's \"Great One\" wants to confound what he calls the Republican establishment's habit of tripping up conservative candidates for president.", "title": "Mark Levin\u2019s Simple Plan to Put a Conservative in White House", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/140927_VVS_Levin_Quinn.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-09-27T21:57:20+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1voKE7b"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Talk radio's \"Great One\" wants to confound what he calls the Republican establishment's habit of tripping up conservative candidates for president.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/140927_VVS_Levin_Quinn.jpg"}, "title": "Mark Levin\u2019s Simple Plan to Put a Conservative in White House", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "elections,religious liberty", "published_time": "2014-09-27T15:01:01+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-09-27T21:57:20+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Mark Levin, Values Voter Summit, VVS, Ronald Reagan, John McCain, Mitt Romney, Hillary Clinton, Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, Marco Rubio, Jeb Bush, Eric Holder"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd15c0\"", "article_summary": "Hard-charging radio commentator Mark Levin is sick of waiting for the Republican Party to nominate a conservative for president, and today he outlined his plan to accomplish just that.\nSpeaking at the Values Voter Summit in Washington, the talk radio giant and bestselling author issued a call to action to the crowd of social conservatives, prescribing a grassroots movement to elect a conservative to the White House in 2016.\nLevin noted the significance of the midterm elections to the just-announced resignation of U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder.\nEven as Democrats have begun to rally behind Hillary Clinton, some look for alternatives to her left such as Sen.
