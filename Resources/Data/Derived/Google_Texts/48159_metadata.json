The fee, referred to as an Obamacare surcharge, is expected to help pay for health insurance coverage the restaurant must provide to its employees, TheBlaze reported.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a 3-percent surcharge that goes completely toward providing health care for all the employees of the restaurant,\u201d Laura Teodori, R\u00e9publique\u2019s manager, told TheBlaze.\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act\u2019s employer mandate, businesses with more than 50 employees are required by law to provide health coverage to its workers. Though the employer mandate was delayed until 2015, with some exceptions, many companies have decided to proactively make changes to their policies in an effort to compensate for the increase in cost associated with providing all employees with health insurance.\n\nIf businesses like R\u00e9publique, which employs more than 50 people, fail to cover their workers, they face a fine. And while the surcharge, labeled \u201c3 percent healthy L.A.\u201d on receipts, appears on all tabs, the eatery can remove it at the request of the customer.\n\n\u201cIf people are very upset about it then of course we don\u2019t make them pay it,\u201d Teodori said. \u201cWe\u2019ll take it off. But most people have been very supportive of it.\u201d\n\nR\u00e9publique, a popular, new high-end restaurant in the posh California city, has received both favorable and unfavorable reviews from customers related to the surcharge.\n\nOne potential customer took to R\u00e9publique\u2019s Facebook page to voice her concerns with the Obamacare surcharge. Janet Chung wrote that while she had never visited the new restaurant, the 3-percent surcharge \u2018turned her off\u2019 from visiting.\n\nThe restaurant, however, defended its decision to add the fee.\n\n\u201cWe are sorry to hear that,\u201d R\u00e9publique responded. \u201cThe surcharge is the best way to provide all of our employees, including those you don\u2019t see in the front of the house, with full benefits. We know this is different and you are welcome to take the 3% out of what you would normally tip.\u201d\n\nOther diners, however, commended the restaurant for looking out for its employees.\n\n\u201cI just read about their 3% health care surcharge,\u201d one customer wrote in a review of R\u00e9publique on Yelp. \u201cI LOVE this. Terrific that they\u2019re looking out for their employees.\u201d\n\nAccording to The Los Angeles Times, restaurant owner Bill Chait is offering all of his employees three health insurance plans through Kaiser, two of which include employer contributions.\n\nSince Obamacare\u2019s implementation last year, many businesses have changed their policies to compensate for the law\u2019s new requirements. Retail giant Target decided to drop its health insurance policies for part-time employees working less than 32 hours per week. Additionally, major companies like AOL and Delta reported President Barack Obama\u2019s signature healthcare will cost them upwards of $7 million and $100 million, respectively.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "Diners at one California restaurant are finding an extra charge tacked to the total of every bill, added to help the eatery pay for health insurance for each employee, as required under Obamacare.", "title": "California restaurant adds Obamacare charge to pay for employees'...", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://redalertpolitics.com/files/2014/02/Republique-600x285.jpg", "height": 285}, "url": "http://redalertpolitics.com/2014/02/19/california-restaurant-adds-obamacare-charge-to-pay-for-employees-health-insurance/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 1285945407, "app_id": 529886110401651}, "msvalidate.01": "0F003B4674EABE0F24651B476B61A43C", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/RedAlertPolitics", "tag": "yelp", "published_time": "2014-02-19T10:54:30+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-02-19T11:45:43+00:00", "author": "melissa.quinn.9461"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd2e7\"", "article_summary": "Retail giant Target decided to drop its health insurance policies for part-time employees working less than 32 hours per week.\nThe fee, referred to as an Obamacare surcharge, is expected to help pay for health insurance coverage the restaurant must provide to its employees, TheBlaze reported.\nDiners at one California restaurant are finding an extra charge tacked to the total of every bill, added to help the eatery pay for health insurance for each employee, as required under Obamacare.\n\u201cI just read about their 3% health care surcharge,\u201d one customer wrote in a review of R\u00e9publique on Yelp.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a 3-percent surcharge that goes completely toward providing health care for all the employees of the restaurant,\u201d Laura Teodori, R\u00e9publique\u2019s manager, told TheBlaze."}
