These days, you can barely step out the door without accidentally offending/microaggressing someone.

So Chris Pratt, star of the new “Jurassic World,” is taking preemptive action and apologizing in advance for whatever politically incorrect comment he’s sure to make during his upcoming press tour—which he knows will inevitably come to be known as “JurrasicGate.”

In a hilarious Facebook update, Pratt wrote, “I want to make a heartfelt apology for whatever it is I end up accidentally saying during the forthcoming #JurassicWorld press tour.”

“And I fully regret what I (accidentally will have) said in (the upcoming foreign and domestic) interview(s).”

I know you can’t say that anymore. In fact in my opinion it was never right to say the thing I definitely don’t want to but probably will have said. To those I (will have) offended please understand how truly sorry I already am. I am fully aware that the subject matter of my imminent forthcoming mistake, a blunder (possibly to be) dubbed “JurassicGate” is (most likely) in no way a laughing matter.

We applaud you, Chris Pratt.
