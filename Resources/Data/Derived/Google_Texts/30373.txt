On Monday, it was revealed that the TSA had paid $1.4 million for an app that points an arrow either to the left or to the right. Chris Pacia, a programmer, posted a video on YouTube showing how it's possible to code an identical app in 10 minutes for about $10 worth of labor.

Watch for yourself here:

While it's almost certain that a sizeable chunk of the $1.4 million went to hardware and training, it's still absurd that at least $300,000 was spent on an app that virtually any basic programmer could have come up with in less than an hour. Something isn't adding up.
