Paul Joseph Wieland and his wife Teresa's lawsuit, but since then the Supreme Court ruled that \"closely-held corporations\" \u2014 companies like Hobby Lobby \u2014 can opt out of the contraceptive mandate due to religious exemptions. Attorney Timothy Belz argued Monday that Hobby Lobby opened the door to the Wieland's suit.\n\nIn this analogy the Wielands are Hobby Lobby and their three daughters \u2014 ages 13, 18 and 19 \u2014 are employees. According to MSNBC, Belz also compared the requirement that health care plans cover birth control to a law requiring parents have a \"stocked unlocked liquor cabinet in their house\" for teens to use. Birth control is also, according to Belz, like sending a kid to college when the only TV channel is pornography.\n\nA judge on the appeals court panel argued that parents could just tell their kids not to get birth control \u2014 in other words, parent their kids. \u201cWell, we all have high hopes for our kids, that is true,\" Belz said. \"We all expect and want them to obey us, they don\u2019t always.\u201d\n\nAnother solution might be for the Wielands to get a different insurance plan. The family currently gets insurance through the state, since Rep. Wieland is a state employee. But as St. Louis Public Radio notes, he could also buy an insurance plan that doesn't cover contraceptives through his business (in an interview he said such insurance would be too expensive).\n\nAlisa Klein, a lawyer representing the government, argued that group plans like the state's can't be tailored to meet the specific needs of every parent. \u201cDifferent people will have different beliefs,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u201cHere we have 100,000 beneficiaries in the Missouri group health care plan and there is no precedent for having the employer design the plan 100,000 ways.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A federal appeals court is currently considering whether Obamacare's birth control mandate violates the religious rights of the parents of teenage girls.", "title": "News, opinion and aggregation on business, politics, entertainment, technology, global and national \u2013 The Wire", "og": {"site_name": "The Wire", "description": "A federal appeals court is currently considering whether Obamacare's birth control mandate violates the religious rights of the parents of teenage girls.", "title": "Missouri Lawmaker Sues to Stop His Daughters' Access to Obamacare Birth Control", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.thewire.com/media/img/upload/wire/2014/09/10/AP628831908333/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.thewire.com/politics/2014/09/missouri-lawmaker-sues-to-stop-his-daughters-access-to-obamacare-birth-control/379987/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A federal appeals court is currently considering whether Obamacare&#39;s birth control mandate violates the religious rights of the parents of teenage girls.", "title": "Missouri Lawmaker Sues to Stop His Daughters' Access to Obamacare Birth Control", "image": "http://cdn.thewire.com/media/img/upload/wire/2014/09/10/AP628831908333/lead_large.jpg", "creator": "@aritbenie", "site": "@thewire", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "app_id": 192759427473466}, "keywords": "The Wire, TheWire.com, TheWire.com, news, opinion, aggregation, business, politics, entertainment, technology, global, national", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheAtlanticWire"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Birth control is also, according to Belz, like sending a kid to college when the only TV channel is pornography.\nA federal appeals court is currently considering whether Obamacare's birth control mandate violates the religious rights of the parents of teenage girls.\nA judge on the appeals court panel argued that parents could just tell their kids not to get birth control \u2014 in other words, parent their kids.\n\"We all expect and want them to obey us, they don\u2019t always.\u201dAnother solution might be for the Wielands to get a different insurance plan.\nIn this analogy the Wielands are Hobby Lobby and their three daughters \u2014 ages 13, 18 and 19 \u2014 are employees."}
