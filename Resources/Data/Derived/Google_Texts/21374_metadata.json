In a recent op-ed Palin, clearly off of any anti-psychotic medicine (but possibly on Adderall) finally weighed in.\n\nIn a move that would make Rommel or Hannibal smile appreciatively, Palin deftly circumvented both her handlers and the Lamestream Media to publish this opus. Thesaurus in hand, the Tea Party icon went on a stream-of-consciousness rant that covered pretty much every base of her camp\u2019s convoluted platform, invoking Reagan (talking about children, no less), the looming threat of immigration reform (\u201cthe 33 million newly legalized voters will overwhelmingly lean Democrat!\u201d), and of course the apocalyptic terror that is Obamacare.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act \u201cin its current corporatist form\u201d is inevitably going to evolve. . . sorry, become Intelligently Designed, into bread-line-God-hating-flag-burning socialism. And for what? We could sink as low as Canada, which Palin ventures to say has \u201ceven worse health care coverage,\u201d conceding how terrible the health industry is in its current pre-Obamacare form. Things were good enough already, though, because \u201cpresently, no one is turned away from emergency rooms.\u201d\n\nAs expected, Palin rails against GOP leadership for failing to completely collapse the global economy over keeping people alive:\n\nBut when it came time to stand up and use the Constitutional tools they have \u2013 the power of the purse strings \u2013 to finally halt the implementation, they balked, waved the white flag, and joined the lapdog media in trashing the good guys who fought for us\u2026 \u2026The media wants you to believe that the partial government shutdown \u201cfractured\u201d the Republican machine from grassroots commonsense conservatives who go by the acronym TEA Party (that stands for \u201cTaxed Enough Already\u201d). No, Tea Party patriots rose up because the Republican machine \u201cfractured\u201d itself years ago by marginalizing its conservative base.\n\nThis is a perfect example of the total absurdity of the TP victim complex. Having shut down the government for weeks and nearly defaulting on outstanding debts just days ago, the Taxed Enough Already (thanks Sarah) team believes they\u2019ve been \u201cmarginalized\u201d by their own party.\n\nPalin did have one good point, though. On Obamacare:\n\nThis is unprecedented. This is radical.\n\nAmen.\n\nImage via\n\nFollow @wtfjack\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "In a move that would make Rommel or Hannibal smile appreciatively, Palin deftly circumvented both her handlers and the Lamestream Media to publish this opus.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Death and Taxes", "description": "In a move that would make Rommel or Hannibal smile appreciatively, Palin deftly circumvented both her handlers and the Lamestream Media to publish this opus.", "title": "Political maven Sarah Palin acknowledges how radical Obamacare is", "url": "http://www.deathandtaxesmag.com/207980/political-maven-sarah-palin-acknowledges-how-radical-obamacare-is/", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://static.deathandtaxesmag.com/uploads/2013/10/palin.jpg", "height": 360}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "In a move that would make Rommel or Hannibal smile appreciatively, Palin deftly circumvented both her handlers and the Lamestream Media to publish this opus.", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 119986914707220}, "keywords": "obamacare,palin,sarah palin,shutdown,tea partty,politics", "article": {"published_time": "2013-10-21T14:30:50Z", "modified_time": "2013-10-21T15:08:39Z"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd93ce\"", "article_summary": "No, Tea Party patriots rose up because the Republican machine \u201cfractured\u201d itself years ago by marginalizing its conservative base.\nIn a recent op-ed Palin, clearly off of any anti-psychotic medicine (but possibly on Adderall) finally weighed in.\nIn a move that would make Rommel or Hannibal smile appreciatively, Palin deftly circumvented both her handlers and the Lamestream Media to publish this opus.\nPalin did have one good point, though.\nWe could sink as low as Canada, which Palin ventures to say has \u201ceven worse health care coverage,\u201d conceding how terrible the health industry is in its current pre-Obamacare form."}
