The Republican Party? No, the GOP\u2019s efforts pale beside the work of two billionaire brothers, Charles and David Koch and their vast network.\n\nThe amount of money the Kochs and their associates have to spend in the 2016 cycle is more than twice what the Republican National Committee (RNC) is planning to put out, according to a report in Politico. Some of the money is theirs, courtesy of the energy company they inherited from their father, but an additional amount comes courtesy of like-minded (and -funded) donors who share the Kochs\u2019 vision of a smaller government that will cut taxes and allow corporate America to do essentially as it pleases as it chases profits.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know of any precedent for this,\u201d campaign finance scholar Robert E. Mutch told Politico. \u201cThe rich guys who wanted to be politically active used to be politically active in the party. What\u2019s different now is you\u2019ve got them being active outside the party.\u201d\n\nThe Koch\u2019s network, operating from 107 offices nationwide with a workforce more than triple that of the RNC, is led by Americans for Prosperity (AFP). That organization, which has seen its efforts pay off in many states, has a staff of 948 and a budget of $104 million. AFP has campaigned to elect state legislators and governors who will work to tear down union rights, fight the Affordable Care Act and cut taxes.\n\nThe Kochs are even starting to rival the RNC\u2019s infrastructure. Freedom Partners, the umbrella organization for the Koch machine, has created i360, a data analytics service that some Republican candidates prefer to the GOP\u2019s. Groups targeting specific audiences, such as the Latinos, older Americans and women have been created.\n\nThe RNC claims that it is still vital to the Republican cause. \u201cThe Kochs\u2019 efforts are helpful to the overall conservative movement, but they can never do the core functions that the party does,\u201d RNC chief strategist Sean Spicer told Politico. But in the party\u2019s own post-mortem to the 2012 election, when it failed to win the White House, it said: \u201cOutside groups now play an expanded role affecting federal races and, in some ways, overshadow state parties in primary and general elections.\u201d The situation \u201chas caused a splintered Congress with little party cohesion so that gridlock and polarization grow as the political parties lose their ability to rally their elected officeholders around a set of coherent governing policies,\u201d according to the report.\n\n-Steve Straehley\n\nTo Learn More:\n\nHow the Koch Network Rivals the GOP (by Kenneth P.
