Alternatively upgrade to a modern browser.\n\nAs Republicans try to reverse the \u201cwar on women\u201d narrative this election, GOP candidate Ben Carson\u2019s gamble to oppose abortion exceptions even in the extreme cases of rape or incest, using the most extreme language of slavery, is likely to have sustained consequences that some say could make him toxic in a competition against Hillary Clinton.\n\n\u201cWhen Ben Carson comes out and says, all rape is a terrible thing but abortion is just like slavery \u2013 as if a pregnant rape victim is running a plantation in her uterus and exploiting the labor of her fetus \u2013 it\u2019s absurd,\u201d said Katha Pollitt, author of Pro: Reclaiming Abortion Rights and columnist for the Nation. \u201cIt\u2019s not a good look for them.\u201d\n\nSuch an aggressive view on abortion may win conservative primary voters \u2013 Carson overtook Republican rival Donald Trump for the first time in a New York Times/CBS News national poll on Tuesday, with 26% to Trump\u2019s 22% \u2013 but it won\u2019t win the White House, said South Carolina senator Lindsey Graham, who is running a low-polling campaign for the Republican nomination.\n\n\u201cI would never tell a woman who has been raped she\u2019s got to carry the child of the rapist,\u201d Graham said on MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe on Monday. \u201cEighty-three percent of the American people feel like that goes too far, so if you would veto a bill that had an exception for rape or incest \u2013 you know, I appreciate your passion for the pro-life issue, but you\u2019re outside of the mainstream and you cannot get elected. Anybody with that position will get creamed.\u201d\n\nOver the weekend, Ben Carson, a political novice who is seeking the GOP nomination, said he would \u201clove\u201d to see abortion outlawed, even in cases of rape or incest, and likened the procedure to slavery.\n\n\u201cI would not be in favor of killing a baby because the baby came about in that way,\u201d Carson said on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press. Carson, whose mild demeanor and provocative commentary have propelled him ahead of Trump in the early-voting state of Iowa, cited \u201cthe many stories of people who have led very useful lives who were the result of rape or incest\u201d.\n\nAs for other exceptions, Carson, a former neurosurgeon, said: \u201cI\u2019m a reasonable person and if people can come up with a reasonable explanation of why they would like to kill a baby, I\u2019ll listen.\u201d\n\nThis election season has already seen several Republican candidates, including Florida senator Marco Rubio, stake out similarly conservative positions on abortion, despite the political risk it poses for the party\u2019s eventual nominee.\n\nPolls show that support for a ban on abortion without exceptions is a deeply unpopular stance nationally. A CNN/ORC poll from August 2012 found that 83% of voters, including 76% of Republicans, believed women should have the right to have an abortion if her pregnancy is caused by rape or incest. An even higher percentage of Americans supported exceptions when the mother\u2019s life was in danger, according to the survey. In a Gallup poll from May 2015, just 19% of Americans believe abortion should be illegal in all circumstances.\n\nDuring the first Republican debate, Rubio defended his staunchly pro-life view, denying that he had ever supported exceptions to a ban on abortion. Wisconsin governor Scott Walker, who has since dropped out of the race, said he does not support exceptions when the mother\u2019s life is in danger because there are alternatives to \u201cmedically necessary\u201d abortions. Former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee said the next president should alter the constitution to outlaw abortion.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like they\u2019re all vying with each other for who can be most anti-abortion, because they\u2019re all vying for the very conservative primary base Republican voter,\u201d said Pollitt.\n\nBut Carson distinguished himself, likening women who seek abortions to slaveholders.\n\n\u201cDuring slavery, a lot of the slave owners thought that they had the right to do whatever they wanted to that slave,\u201d Carson said during the NBC interview. \u201cAnything that they chose to do. And, you know, what if the abolitionist had said, you know, \u2018I don\u2019t believe in slavery. I think it\u2019s wrong. But you guys do whatever you want to do.\u2019 Where would we be?\u201d\n\nOn Monday, Carson\u2019s campaign dismissed any concern that the candidate\u2019s staunch views on abortion would damage his standing. In fact, it appears to be fueling enthusiasm among his evangelical base.\n\n\u201cWhile sometimes this language may be uncomfortable to people \u2026 Dr Carson is very clear about his support for life, and people across the country recognize that,\u201d Deana Bass, Carson\u2019s campaign spokeswoman, said on MSNBC Live with Thomas Roberts on Monday. \u201cAnd so when he says these things, he\u2019s speaking truth and the campaign is not worried at all about this.\u201d\n\nAbortion politics are especially potent for both parties this election cycle, after anti-abortion activists released a string of controversial videos that are edited to imply Planned Parenthood engages in the unlawful practice of selling fetal tissue for profit, a claim Planned Parenthood forcefully denies. At least six state-led investigations into the organization in the wake of the video scandal have turned up nothing.\n\nDemocrats are eager to engage Republicans in a fight over women\u2019s reproductive rights, an area where they have stumbled with ill-advised comments, such as the \u201clegitimate rape\u201d remark that damaged the party\u2019s standing with women ahead of the 2012 election. That year, Barack Obama decidedly won the women\u2019s vote by 12 percentage points against Republican challenger Mitt Romney.\n\nPrimary candidates who plant themselves too firmly to the right on major social issues could be vulnerable to attacks by Democrats that they are too extreme. Already, Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton has signaled that she will use women\u2019s reproductive rights as a wedge issue against Republicans in 2016.\n\n\u201cExtreme views about women,\u201d Clinton said at a speech in Cleveland in August, which was derided by Republicans for pushing the war on women narrative. \u201cWe expect that from some of the terrorist groups, we expect that from people who don\u2019t want to live in the modern world, but it\u2019s a little hard to take from Republicans who want to be the president of the United States.\u201d\n\nOn the same day in August, Carson told a crowd in Arkansas: \u201cThere is no war on women. There may be a war on what\u2019s inside of women, but there is no war on women in this country.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#005689", "description": "The Republican candidate\u2019s extreme pro-life stance threatens the party\u2019s reputation with women \u2013 and yet he managed to eclipse Trump for the first time", "application-name": "The Guardian", "author": "Molly Redden", "og": {"site_name": "the Guardian", "description": "The Republican candidate\u2019s extreme pro-life stance threatens the party\u2019s reputation with women \u2013 and yet he managed to eclipse Trump for the first time", "title": "Ben Carson overtakes Trump in national poll despite likening abortion to slavery", "url": "http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/oct/27/ben-carson-donald-trump-national-poll-abortion-republicans", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/30c28d57a7348d17bfb692485b3434aa1ec1ec6a/0_164_4000_2405/master/4000.jpg?w=1200&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=243f0a282260b5ea2f12d4cad6419ed1", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"app": {"url": {"ipad": "gnmguardian://us-news/2015/oct/27/ben-carson-donald-trump-national-poll-abortion-republicans?contenttype=Article&source=twitter", "googleplay": "guardian://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/oct/27/ben-carson-donald-trump-national-poll-abortion-republicans", "iphone": "gnmguardian://us-news/2015/oct/27/ben-carson-donald-trump-national-poll-abortion-republicans?contenttype=Article&source=twitter"}, "id": {"ipad": 409128287, "iphone": 409128287, "googleplay": "com.guardian"}, "name": {"ipad": "The Guardian", "googleplay": "The Guardian", "iphone": "The Guardian"}}, "creator": "@LGamGam", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/30c28d57a7348d17bfb692485b3434aa1ec1ec6a/0_164_4000_2405/master/4000.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@guardian"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Guardian", "al": {"ios": {"url": "gnmguardian://us-news/2015/oct/27/ben-carson-donald-trump-national-poll-abortion-republicans?contenttype=Article&source=applinks", "app_store_id": 409128287, "app_name": "The Guardian"}}, "HandheldFriendly": "True", "fb": {"app_id": 180444840287}, "theme-color": "#005689", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/favicons/f06f6996e193d1ddcd614ea852322d25/windows_tile_144_b.png", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "keywords": "Republicans,US news,Ben Carson,US elections 2016,Gender,Abortion,World news,Reproductive rights", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theguardian", "published_time": "2015-10-27T13:11:46.000Z", "author": "https://www.theguardian.com/profile/lauren-gambino,https://www.theguardian.com/profile/molly-redden", "section": "US news", "modified_time": "2016-05-25T14:15:39.000Z", "tag": "Republicans,US news,Ben Carson,US elections 2016,Gender,Abortion,World news,Reproductive rights"}, "thumbnail": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/30c28d57a7348d17bfb692485b3434aa1ec1ec6a/0_164_4000_2405/4000.jpg?w=620&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=46dad385b2dea03eca946bcfbbfc3d0e", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Republicans,US news,Ben Carson,US elections 2016,Gender,Abortion,World news,Reproductive rights"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7ec3\"", "article_summary": "There may be a war on what\u2019s inside of women, but there is no war on women in this country.\u201d\nPolls show that support for a ban on abortion without exceptions is a deeply unpopular stance nationally.\nIn a Gallup poll from May 2015, just 19% of Americans believe abortion should be illegal in all circumstances.\n\u201cExtreme views about women,\u201d Clinton said at a speech in Cleveland in August, which was derided by Republicans for pushing the war on women narrative.\nDuring the first Republican debate, Rubio defended his staunchly pro-life view, denying that he had ever supported exceptions to a ban on abortion."}
