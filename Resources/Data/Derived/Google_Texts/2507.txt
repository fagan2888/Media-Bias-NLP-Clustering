Things got heated between a self identified U.S. Marine and Bill Clinton during a rally in South Carolina on Saturday.

The former Marine who claimed that he had spent time in Afghanistan challenged Hillary Clinton's continuing scandal over what took place in Benghazi, Libya on Sept. 11, 2012.

The veteran passionately raised his voice and Bill Clinton responded.

“If you shut up and listen to my answer, I’ll answer it,” Clinton said. “His mind has been poisoned by lies, and he won’t listen.”

"You listen to me... I'm not your Commander in Chief anymore but if I were, I'd tell you to be more polite."

The Marine replied by saying that, "I wouldn't listen."
