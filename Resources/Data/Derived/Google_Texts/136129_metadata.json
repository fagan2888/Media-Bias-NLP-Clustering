Interestingly, it\u2019s the genetic factors that create this link.\n\n\u201cImportantly, this does not imply that sons or brothers of sex offenders inevitably become offenders too,\u201d Niklas L\u00e5ngstr\u00f6m, professor of psychiatric epidemiology at Karolinksa Institute and lead author of the study, said in the press release. \u201cBut although sex crime convictions are relatively few overall, our study shows that the family risk increase is substantial. Preventive treatment for families at risk could possibly reduce the number of future victims.\u201d\n\nResearchers from Oxford University and Karolinska Institute examined data on 21,566 men who had been convicted of sexual offences in Sweden between 1973 and 2009. They analyzed the chunk of brothers and fathers of convicted sex offenders who had committed offences themselves, then compared that to Swedish men from the general population. The results showed that 2.5 percent of the brothers and fathers of convicted sex offenders also happened to be sex offenders themselves \u2014 compared to the same 0.5 percent in the general population.\n\nForty percent of this is due to genetic factors, the authors claim, while another 58 percent of difference in risk seems to be due to \u201cnon-shared\u201d environmental factors, like complications as a baby in the womb, head injuries, and childhood sexual abuse.\n\nWhile genetics play a huge role in this, the authors note that this doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that there\u2019s a specific \u201csex offender gene.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are definitely not saying that we have \u2018found a gene for sexual offending\u2019 or anything of the kind,\u201d Professor Seena Fazel, an author of the study, said in the press release. \u201cIt tells us something about why if we take two sets of brothers, whose backgrounds might look identical, one set has a higher risk of sexual offending than the other \u2014 a large proportion of this difference is likely to be due to genetic factors.\u201d\n\nFazel continues that in current procedures, genetic factors are rarely taken into account when making risk assessments of people at high risk of sexual offence. \u201cMany of the families we are talking about may already be known to social services for other reasons [\u2026] if we can predict those at high risk of offending with greater accuracy, then it may be possible to shape these interventions and target education and preventative therapies where they could do the most good.\u201d\n\nThe researchers hope to move their research to the next step by undertaking a large-scale study with biological samples \u2014 with the aim of looking for gene patterns that could make it easier to identify potential sex offenders before they commit crimes.\n\nSource: L\u00e5ngstr\u00f6m N, Babchishin K, Fazel S, Lichtenstein P, Frisell T. \u201cSexual offending runs in families: A 37-year nationwide study.\u201d International Journal of Epidemiology. 2015.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "sex offenders, sex crimes", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Sex offending may run in a family\u2019s genes, according to a new study that found brothers and fathers of sex convicts were five times more likely to be offenders themselves.", "title": "Relatives Of Sex Offenders 5 Times More Likely To Commit Sex Crimes", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/sexual-assault-runs-families-relatives-sex-offenders-5-times-more-likely-commit-sex-328818", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/04/10/prisoner.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Sex offending may run in a family\u2019s genes, according to a new study that found brothers and fathers of sex convicts were five times more likely to be offenders themselves.", "title": "Relatives Of Sex Offenders 5 Times More Likely To Commit Sex Crimes", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/sexual-assault-runs-families-relatives-sex-offenders-5-times-more-likely-commit-sex-328818", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/04/10/prisoner.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/04/10/prisoner.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-04-10T14:32:12-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-10T14:32:11-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Sex offending may run in a family\u2019s genes, according to a new study that found brothers and fathers of sex convicts were five times more likely to be offenders themselves."}, "article_summary": "The results showed that 2.5 percent of the brothers and fathers of convicted sex offenders also happened to be sex offenders themselves \u2014 compared to the same 0.5 percent in the general population.\nPeople who are related to sex offenders are more likely to be sex offenders themselves;
