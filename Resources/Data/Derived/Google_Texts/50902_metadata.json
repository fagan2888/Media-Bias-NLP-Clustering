In fact, in some ways it will be cheaper to purchase one of the more modest insurance plans than to pay the penalty.\n\nRelated: Millions Face Premium and Deductible Sticker Shock under Obamacare\n\nFor individuals who went without insurance in early 2015 despite being eligible to enroll, the average household penalty in 2016 will be $969 \u2013 a 47 percent increase over the average estimated penalty of $661 in 2015, according to a new analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation. People who are eligible for federal premium subsidies will have to pay an average household penalty of $738 in 2016 if they don\u2019t sign up, while the average household penalty will total $1,450 for uninsured people who are not eligible for any financial assistance.\n\nThe penalties mandated by the Obamacare legislation were designed to force millions of uninsured Americans to purchase health insurance policies from a variety of choices. The increase in signups is considered a key component in attracting private insurance companies to participate in the program.\n\nBut the enrollment effort has repeatedly fallen short of government forecasts and expectations; the Department of Health and Human Services currently is projecting an enrollment next year of 10.1 million individuals \u2013 just 100,000 or so above this year\u2019s level. Whether the tougher regime of penalties makes any appreciable difference remains to be seen. The so-called \u201cindividual mandate\u201d to force uninsured Americans to sign up for coverage is arguably one of the least popular provisions of the controversial law.\n\nToday, there are about 10.5 million uninsured Americans eligible for coverage under Obamacare, including about 7 million who could qualify for premium subsidies. They are considered the prime target for the program\u2019s marketing strategy. As the Kaiser Family Foundation study points out, nearly half of them could purchase a \u201cbronze\u201d insurance policy \u2013 the most basic of coverage -- for less than the penalty they would owe. A quarter of those enrollees could escape paying any premium at all once their tax subsidy is applied.\n\nRelated: The Thrill Is Gone for Obamacare as Health-Care Approval Fades\n\n\u201cIn other words, 3.5 million subsidy-eligible uninsured people could either get coverage for free or end up paying less by enrolling in marketplace coverage than by remaining uninsured and paying the individual mandate penalty.\n\nHowever, that may be less of an enticement than it seems. Bronze plans come with high deductibles or out of pocket costs and those are going to be much higher in the coming year. Low-income enrollees may be better off financially enrolling in silver plans that have higher premiums but are eligible for cost-sharing subsidies.\n\nOpen enrollment for the new insurance season began Nov. 1 and will run through the end of January. The administration this week began stepping up its campaign to pressure uninsured Americans to sign up for coverage, signaling that the government will be far less accommodating than it was in the past, according to The New York Times.\n\nFor example, the administration announced that there would not be another special enrollment period around the April 15 tax filing deadline, as was the case this year. Moreover, Americans who claimed tax subsidies for their policies this year will have to demonstrate on their 2015 tax returns that they meet the income levels to qualify for the subsidies. If they are unable to provide the necessary income documentation, Obamacare beneficiaries could face tax penalties or stiff deductions from their tax returns to recoup the subsidies, according to some experts.\n\nRelated: Democrats Begin the Long, Tortuous Retreat from Obamacare\n\nThere will be new, complicated tax forms to fill out and more questions to answer, which is all music to the ears of the nation\u2019s accountants and tax preparers. For example, officials of H&R Block, one of the nation\u2019s largest tax preparation companies, are gleefully predicting a bonanza of new clients who must file the special tax returns by April 18.\n\n\u201cThe era of leniency with the Affordable Act is coming to an end,\u201d said Mark Ciaramitaro, H&R Block\u2019s vice president for taxes and health care, according to the Kansas City Star. Ciaramitro said, \u201cWe\u2019re not holding anything back\u201d in terms of mounting an aggressive advertising campaign to tap into the Obamacare tax preparation business.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "After two years of genteel coaxing of millions of Americans to sign up for health insu", "title": "Steep New Penalties for Uninsured Americans Who Don\u2019t Enroll in Obamacare", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/12/10/Steep-New-Penalties-Uninsured-Americans-Who-Don-t-Enroll-Obamacare", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/10032012_Health_Costs_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/12/10/Steep-New-Penalties-Uninsured-Americans-Who-Don-t-Enroll-Obamacare", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/10032012_Health_Costs_article.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "After two years of genteel coaxing of millions of Americans to sign up for health insu", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "The penalties mandated by the Obamacare legislation were designed to force millions of uninsured Americans to purchase health insurance policies from a variety of choices.\nToday, there are about 10.5 million uninsured Americans eligible for coverage under Obamacare, including about 7 million who could qualify for premium subsidies.\nCiaramitro said, \u201cWe\u2019re not holding anything back\u201d in terms of mounting an aggressive advertising campaign to tap into the Obamacare tax preparation business.\nThe so-called \u201cindividual mandate\u201d to force uninsured Americans to sign up for coverage is arguably one of the least popular provisions of the controversial law.\nMoreover, Americans who claimed tax subsidies for their policies this year will have to demonstrate on their 2015 tax returns that they meet the income levels to qualify for the subsidies."}
