Rates will not be finalized until the fall, and in some cases states can exert pressure on insurers to lower their proposed price hikes.\n\nMany analysts believe that the actual rates for 2017 will contain price hikes that are significantly steeper than the increases seen in prior years, however. The price increases will reflect not only higher medical costs, but also the fact that many plans are seeing older, sicker enrollees than they had projected. Such enrollees can cost more in terms of benefits paid than what they pay in monthly premiums.\n\nAnother big factor at play is that next year will see the end of two out of the three Obamacare programs that are designed to limit the financial risk that insurers run by selling the plans.\n\nBut Caroline Pearson, senior vice president at Avalere, said that \"despite premiums rising overall, many consumers will be insulated from higher rates due to premium subsidies that limit monthly cost for many exchange enrollees.\"\n\nMore than 80 percent of Obamacare-exchange customers qualify for federal tax credits that reduce their monthly premiums. And more than half of such customers additionally qualify for reductions in what they personally owe in out-of-pocket medical expenses.\n\nHowever, both forms of subsidies are not available to people who buy individual health plans outside of the exchanges.\n\n\n\n\"Consumers may have to switch plans in order to avoid dramatic rate increases,\" Pearson said, \"but competitive options should still be available in most regions in the U.S.\"", "article_metadata": {"AssetType": "cnbcnewsstory", "description": "Where you buy Obamacare plans could significantly affect how much more you will pay for your coverage next year.", "author": "Dan Mangan", "og": {"site_name": "CNBC", "description": "Proposed price increases for Obamacare plans vary widely across states, and even within states.", "title": "Obamacare price hikes are coming\u2014but they depend on where you live", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2016/05/24/cost-of-obamacare-price-increases-depends-on-where-you-live.html", "image": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2016/05/24/103661553-GettyImages-469196691.1910x1000.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Proposed price increases for Obamacare plans vary widely across states, and even within states.", "title": "Price increases for Obamacare depend on where you live", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2016/05/24/cost-of-obamacare-price-increases-depends-on-where-you-live.html", "image": {"src": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2016/05/24/103661553-GettyImages-469196691.1910x1000.jpg"}, "creator": "@_DanMangan", "site": "@CNBC", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"ios": {"app_name": "CNBC Business News and Finance", "app_store_id": 398018310}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=398018310", "GOOGLEBOT": "unavailable_after: 31 Dec 9999 23:59:59 GMT", "keywords": "Health Care, Oklahoma, Washington DC, Indiana, New York, Maryland, Washington, Maine, Virginia, Oregon, Vermont, Health Care, Obamacare, Health Insurance, US: News, Politics, business news", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cnbc", "published_time": "2016-05-24T14:18:31-0400", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/dan.mangan.54", "section": "Health Care", "modified_time": "2016-05-25T08:20:11-0400", "tag": "Politics"}, "pageNodeId": 103661527, "news_keywords": "Obamacare, health care, health insurance, prescription drugs"}, "article_summary": "The price increases will reflect not only higher medical costs, but also the fact that many plans are seeing older, sicker enrollees than they had projected.\nRates will not be finalized until the fall, and in some cases states can exert pressure on insurers to lower their proposed price hikes.\nSuch enrollees can cost more in terms of benefits paid than what they pay in monthly premiums.\nMore than 80 percent of Obamacare-exchange customers qualify for federal tax credits that reduce their monthly premiums.\nMany analysts believe that the actual rates for 2017 will contain price hikes that are significantly steeper than the increases seen in prior years, however."}
