REUTERS/Jason Reed/Files\n\n4547286\n\nSurgeon General Vivek Murthy, who was sworn in this week after a long confirmation battle over his stance on gun control, issued his first remarks on the issue during an interview with NPR that aired Saturday.\n\nMurthy became a polarizing figure after President Obama nominated him for surgeon general in 2013. Gun rights groups took issue with his public stance on guns and pressured lawmakers to vote against his confirmation.\n\nOne controversial tweet Murthy sent in 2012 read: \u201cTired of politicians playing politics w/guns, putting lives at risk b/c they\u2019re scared of [National Rifle Association]. Guns are a health care issue.\u201d\n\nBut Murthy, the founder of the nonprofit group Doctors for America (formerly Doctors for Obama), was finally confirmed in a lame-duck 51-43 vote in December, much to the pleasure of gun control groups.\n\nDuring his interview with NPR, Murthy was asked what he meant by his tweet and what his plans are regarding gun control as surgeon general.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s what I meant when I wrote that tweet,\u201d Murthy began. \u201cViolence of all kinds is a public health issue. When you have large numbers of people dying from preventable causes, that\u2019s a health care issue. That\u2019s a public health issue.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to find a way that we can reduce violence in America, and I think you would be hard-pressed to find parents or families of victims, or health care practitioners who would disagree.\u201d\n\nLISTEN:\n\nMurthy was asked whether he thinks more gun control is part of this response. During Senate hearings early last year, Murthy said \u201cI do not intend to use the surgeon general\u2019s office as a bully pulpit for gun control.\u201d\n\nDuring his interview with NPR, Murthy evaded the question of whether his focus on guns as a public health issue will lead to more gun control.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m calling for is more common sense,\u201d Murthy said.\n\n\u201cWe may see various issues around violence as highly politicized because of how they\u2019re covered or how they\u2019re spoken about in public settings. These problems that we face are not problems that one party or one sector can solve on their own.\u201d\n\nWhether or not Murthy plans to ramp up gun control measures while in office, his supporters expressed joy after he was sworn in on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cA big step for common sense: Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy was sworn in just a few minutes ago!\u201d former Arizona U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords\u2019s group, Americans for Responsible Solutions, wrote on social media on Wednesday, the website Guns.com noted.\n\n\u201cThe gun lobby fought hard against his nomination \u2013 all because he\u2019d said gun violence is a \u2018health care issue.\u2019 With your help, we went toe-to-toe with the gun lobby, and we won. Now, we have a Surgeon General who recognizes what the data makes quite clear: gun violence is a threat to public health,\u201d the post continued.\n\nFollow Chuck on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Chuck Ross", "description": "Vivek Murthy talked about guns in his first interview since taking over as surgeon general.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Surgeon General Vivek Murthy, who was sworn in this week after a long confirmation battle over his stance on gun control, issued his first remarks on the issue during an interview with NPR that aired", "title": "Controversial Surgeon General Offers First Remarks On Gun Control Since Taking Office [AUDIO]", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2015/04/25/controversial-surgeon-general-offers-first-remarks-on-gun-control-since-taking-office-audio/", "image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/2014-03-18T152757Z_1_CBREA2H16YN00_RTROPTP_4_USA-HEALTHCARE-SURGEONGENERAL-OBAMA-e1399902362467.jpg", "height": 346}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Vivek Murthy was sworn in this week", "title": "Controversial Surgeon General Offers First Remarks On Gun Control Since Taking Office [AUDIO] Via @dailycaller", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2015/04/25/controversial-surgeon-general-offers-first-remarks-on-gun-control-since-taking-office-audio/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/2014-03-18T152757Z_1_CBREA2H16YN00_RTROPTP_4_USA-HEALTHCARE-SURGEONGENERAL-OBAMA-e1399902362467.jpg"}, "creator": "@@ChuckRossDC", "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-04-25 14:39:32", "sailthru.title": "Controversial Surgeon General Offers First Remarks On Gun Control Since Taking Office [AUDIO]", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "sailthru.tags": "national-rifle-association,chuck-ross", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "keywords": "national rifle association,vivek murthy", "sailthru.description": "Surgeon General Vivek Murthy, who was sworn in this week after a long confirmation battle over his stance on gun control, issued his first remarks on the issue during an interview with NPR that aired", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/2014-03-18T152757Z_1_CBREA2H16YN00_RTROPTP_4_USA-HEALTHCARE-SURGEONGENERAL-OBAMA-e1399902362467.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc445\"", "article_summary": "During his interview with NPR, Murthy was asked what he meant by his tweet and what his plans are regarding gun control as surgeon general.\nNow, we have a Surgeon General who recognizes what the data makes quite clear: gun violence is a threat to public health,\u201d the post continued.\nMurthy became a polarizing figure after President Obama nominated him for surgeon general in 2013.\n\u201cThe gun lobby fought hard against his nomination \u2013 all because he\u2019d said gun violence is a \u2018health care issue.\u2019 With your help, we went toe-to-toe with the gun lobby, and we won.\nWhen you have large numbers of people dying from preventable causes, that\u2019s a health care issue."}
