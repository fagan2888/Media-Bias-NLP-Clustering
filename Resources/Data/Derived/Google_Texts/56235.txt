Wednesday Newsmax TV’s “The Steve Malzberg Show,” Dr. Ben Carson pointed out that things like the ObamaCare architect Jonathan Gruber calling American voters “stupid,” IRS computers going missing and the Benghazi cover-up to help President Barack Obama win reelection are allowed to happen because the American media “likes to distort things” and they also think the people are stupid and easily manipulated.

Carson said, ” I think a lot of people are beginning to see the folly of the media. The media likes to distort things and to manipulate people and the assumption is people are stupid as the revelation came out this week. The assumption is people can be easily mipulated and controlled. Maybe that’s true but I believe people are waking up in droves.”
