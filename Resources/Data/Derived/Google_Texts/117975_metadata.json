Bowe Bergdahl that have already been reported but now seem to be suppressed. Any citizen or soldier who has knowingly assisted to \u201caid and abet the enemy\u201d may be charged with \u201cmisbehavior\u201d or \u201ctreason.\u201d The penalty for treason can be more severe than misbehavior.\n\nThe early reports of Bergdahl\u2019s aiding his captors in undermining armed forces\u2019 security are no longer being discussed \u2014 and most likely for good reason, namely security. I do not doubt that the military knows much more than the press about Bergdahl\u2019s \u201cmisbehavior\u201d before the enemy. Feldman could be correct that Bergdahl won\u2019t be charged with \u201cmisbehavior.\u201d However, the investigation could also escalate to the charge of treason as well. Let\u2019s see what the Army finally decides.\n\nE.
