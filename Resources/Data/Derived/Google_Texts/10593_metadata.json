She\u2019s gone from making $8 an hour to $10.50. She now has benefits like health care and paid time off. And she has a schedule she can count on that fits well with her eight-year-old daughter\u2019s needs.\n\nThis should have been made her life a lot easier, except for one thing: the lapse in her food stamps benefits. When she reported the new income from her job to her case manager, she was told that it was too high to qualify for food stamps for a family of two, and her case had been closed. That means that instead of being able to attend the computer classes she was taking, a requirement if she wants to be promoted to supervisor at work, she\u2019s working a second job and can\u2019t sleep.\n\nI cannot do it because I\u2019m getting sick, have a headache.\n\n\u201cI cannot do it because I\u2019m getting sick, have a headache,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause I cannot sleep.\u201d But do it she has to in order to have enough income to provide for her daughter.\n\nDelores, a 40-year-old single mom from suburban Virginia who requested her name be changed so she could discuss her employment openly, is going through what is referred to as the \u201cbenefits cliff\u201d or a \u201cmarginal tax rate\u201d: some public assistance programs \u2013 most notably food stamps, child care, and Medicaid \u2013 have cutoff limits based on income. If a recipient gets a new job that suddenly puts her earnings above that limit, she can face a sharp reduction in benefits. What should be an improvement in finances ends up costing more.\n\nIt\u2019s a problem that has caught the eye of Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI). In his recently released poverty reform proposal, he describes the phenomenon in which low-income people get raises but see little of the extra money because the benefits they had been relying on get phased out. Ryan claims that poor people, therefore, have an incentive to stay poorer, because \u201cas families earn more money, they get less aid.\u201d\n\nYet he can\u2019t seem to find a solution. \u201c[F]ixing these incentives is no easy task,\u201d he writes. Phasing benefits out more slowly, to smooth out the cliff, in his mind is \u201cprohibitively expensive,\u201d but he acknowledges that solving it by just giving less in benefits to begin with \u201cwould mean deep cuts for the most vulnerable.\u201d\n\nDelores would have suffered from a fix that simply creates a stingier safety net. Before her new job at Sodexo, where she now works as a cashier, she worked at a Rite Aid, before that a gas station, and before that at TJ Maxx and DSW, always making around $8 or $9 an hour. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t enough,\u201d she said, so she and her daughter have relied on food stamps since 2007. The benefits \u201chelped a lot,\u201d allowing her to get \u201ceverything I needed for my daughter.\u201d\n\nBut she was always on the hunt for something better. \u201cI was looking for anyone that would pay more and have benefits,\u201d she said.\n\nAnd even though it may have cut into her benefits, Delores will tell you, \u201cI\u2019m happy that I got the new job.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s clear that she takes pride and solace in the new position. \u201cThe thing was over [at Rite Aid], the hours changed every week,\u201d she pointed out. \u201cThe new job has a fixed schedule. I work from six to two every day, Monday through Friday.\u201d\n\nThis was the first vacation in seven years.\n\nShe also has vacation benefits for the first time in a long time, a paid week off, so she and her daughter just took a trip to Florida. \u201cThis was the first vacation in seven years,\u201d she said. And there are more benefits: paid holidays, paid sick days, and help covering health insurance premiums.\n\nEvidence shows that her desire for a new and better job, regardless of the impact on her food stamps, is emblematic of how people approach the benefits cliff. \u201c[R]esearch suggests that, in practice, families do little to reduce their work hours or wages in response to the marginal tax rates that benefit phase-downs create,\u201d Arloc Sherman writes at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.\n\nIt also doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense for many recipients to factor the loss of benefits into their decision to seek new work, says Melissa Boteach, vice president of Half in Ten and the poverty and prosperity program at the Center for American Progress. \u201cI don\u2019t think the average low-income person who desperately wants to work and wants to get pay raises is doing calculations about what this means for each and every benefit,\u201d she pointed out. Delores didn\u2019t even know her benefits would be reduced until after she got the better job.\n\n\u201cThe cliffs are not a problem because they\u2019re a work disincentive\u2026the problem is the hardship,\u201d Boteach added.\n\nThe cliffs are not a problem because they\u2019re a work disincentive\u2026the problem is the hardship.\n\nAnd Delores is certainly experiencing hardship as she struggles to make it all work. \u201cIf I\u2019m working seven days a week, school, plus my daughter, I cannot do it,\u201d she said. \u201cRight now I\u2019m supposed to go [to computer classes] four days a week but I cannot do it because I need to work.\u201d She doesn\u2019t have time for her own homework, let alone find the time to help her daughter with her homework.\n\nWhile there are certainly other families like Delores\u2019s that have hit a benefits cliff, Ryan also may overstate the problem. Not all poor families encounter it, and in fact it seems to only impact a small portion of families.\n\nBut if there is bipartisan agreement that this drop-off is painful for the families that do experience it, there are few options other than spending more money to make it more gradual. \u201cBasically the two ways you can get rid of the cliff are to either eliminate the program or cut it for the most vulnerable people,\u201d said Boteach, \u201cor to make further investments so the service tapers down more slowly with each dollar of earned income.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s how the Medicaid cliff, which she said \u201cwas one of the strongest cliffs,\u201d is being eased in states that have expanded the program as part of the Affordable Care Act: at a certain level above the poverty line, someone doesn\u2019t get his health insurance automatically cut off as before, but instead gets a tax credit to help cover the cost that declines gradually as income increases. \u201cUnfortunately the states that have failed to take up the expansion are preserving this cliff,\u201d she added.\n\nOne way to fix the sharp cutoff for child care subsidies or food stamps would be to have \u201cbands,\u201d Boteach said, dictating how much in benefits a family gets between, say, 100 and 150 percent of the poverty line, allowing them to earn income that fluctuates within the band while keeping their benefits steady.\n\nOthers have suggested keeping people eligible for 12-month periods, no matter what happens to their income. If a parent\u2019s earnings increase with a new job during that time, she could still keep her child care subsidies, allowing her to continue working and giving her kid a stable and continuous care setting.\n\nAnd of course making programs universal would end the cliffs completely. Universal preschool and single-payer health care wouldn\u2019t have these problems.\n\nIn the meantime, Delores will keep wavering between highs and lows. Given her newly stable hours, \u201cI\u2019m happy,\u201d she said. But on the other hand, her schedule with a part-time job is wreaking havoc on her. \u201cSometimes I\u2019m feeling like I\u2019m getting sick because I don\u2019t sleep well,\u201d she said, without an idea for how to make it better.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "How the \"benefits cliff\" can bring hardship when someone gets a better job.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "How the \"benefits cliff\" can bring hardship when someone gets a better job.", "title": "Meet A Woman Whose Raise Cost Her Money", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/economy/2014/08/19/3472981/benefits-cliff/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Benefits_cliff_cover.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "How the \"benefits cliff\" can bring hardship when someone gets a better job.", "title": "Meet A Woman Whose Raise Cost Her Money", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Benefits_cliff_cover-321x214.jpg", "creator": "@brycecovert", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-economy", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Benefits_cliff_cover.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Benefits_cliff_cover.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-19T14:47:50+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/brycercovert"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9c86\"", "article_summary": "This should have been made her life a lot easier, except for one thing: the lapse in her food stamps benefits.\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t enough,\u201d she said, so she and her daughter have relied on food stamps since 2007.\nWhile there are certainly other families like Delores\u2019s that have hit a benefits cliff, Ryan also may overstate the problem.\n\u201cThe cliffs are not a problem because they\u2019re a work disincentive\u2026the problem is the hardship,\u201d Boteach added.\nEvidence shows that her desire for a new and better job, regardless of the impact on her food stamps, is emblematic of how people approach the benefits cliff."}
