If so, the penalty you'll end up paying on your tax return might be more than you think.\n\nUnder health reform, if you lack minimal essential coverage (such as an employer plan) and you don't fall under one of nine exemptions, you need to get health insurance. Otherwise, you face an annual penalty \u2014 the one the U.S. Supreme Court deemed a tax.\n\nJust how high of a penalty? That's the source of a lot of confusion, partly because the formula for calculating it is complicated.\n\nThe feds call the tax the \"individual shared responsibility payment.\" Many have seized upon the penalty for singles \u2014 $95 for all of 2014 \u2014 as reason to forgo coverage that will cost more than $95 a month.\n\nBut it's not that simple, as Roberton Williams of the Tax Policy Center has pointed out, for a number of reasons.\n\nYour penalty will likely be more than $95. In fact, if you're single and make more than $19,650 next year, you'll owe more. And in future years, you'll owe considerably more, depending on your income.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office has estimated the penalties will generate $7 billion in revenues by 2017 and $9 billion by 2021.\n\nHere's why. The Affordable Care Act says those who refuse coverage must pay either a flat fee per uncovered family member or a percentage of excess income, whichever's higher. That's the key: whichever amount is greater determines the fee you pay.\n\nThe flat fees are deceivingly low. For 2014, it's $95 per adult dependent age 18 or older. It's half that amount for each child under age 18. This flat fee, regardless of household size, can't be more than $285 per household.\n\n\"Except it can,\" Williams writes.\n\nThat's right. The flat-fee cap means nothing if you've got what the government calls \"excess income.\"\n\nWhat's \"excess income\"?\n\nExcess income is the amount of your household's modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) that exceeds the amount at which you're required to file a tax return.\n\nFor a single taxpayer in 2014, that threshold for filing is $10,150. For a married couple, the filing threshold is $20,300. (For tax geeks, the filing threshold is the standard deduction plus the personal exemption.)\n\nNow, what's your MAGI, in this case? It's basically your adjusted gross income (the last figure at the bottom of the front page of Form 1040, or Line 4 on Form 1040 EZ) plus any tax-exempt interest, foreign income and all the MAGI of the dependents you claim.\n\nIf you don't have any tax-exempt muni bonds (Line 8b, Form 1040), untaxed Social Security income (Line 20a minus 20b on Form 1040) or foreign earnings (Form 2555), you can safely assume your MAGI is your AGI.\n\nRepeat after me: Your Maggie is usually your Aggie, unless you have muni bond income or earnings from abroad. (Read more about MAGIs in the accompanying story.)\n\nPause a moment to breathe. Allow any resentment against the tax code to drift out of your body.\n\nOnce you've figured your excess income amount, you multiply it by an income percentage set by the law. In 2014, it was 1 percent of the amount of your income. In 2015, it will be 2 percent.\n\nDo the math and you'll see that any single person under age 65 making more than $19,650 in 2014 will likely owe more than $95. Any couple making more than $48,800 will likely owe more than $285.\n\nFor example, a single person with MAGI of $35,000 and no dependents will owe a penalty of $249, not $95, according to the Tax Policy Center's calculator.\n\nCan it be reduced?\n\nYes. The penalty is pro-rated if you had insurance part of the year. If you were uninsured for five months out of the year, then your $249 penalty would be five-twelfths of that, or $103.75.\n\nAlso, you likely won't pay a penalty if you were uninsured for less than three months. And if you went uncovered because of problems with Cover Oregon or another state exchange, you'll likely qualify for a special hardship exemption and avoid the penalty. There's also a cap on the excess income penalty. It can't be more than the average annual premium for a national bronze level insurance plan. For 2014, that was $2,448 per individual, with a maximum of $12,240 for a family with five or more uncovered members. And it has to correspond to the family members who aren't exempt and who don't lack coverage, Livingston said.\n\nAnd if you can't find health insurance that costs less than 8 percent of your income, you'll probably be exempt from the penalty.\n\nWill the penalty change?\n\nThe penalty will go up substantially over the next two years. In 2015 that flat fee schedule goes to $325 per adult dependent and about $162.50 per child, with a household cap of $975.\n\nIn 2016, the flat fee hits $695 per adult dependent, $347.50 per child, with a household cap of $2,085. After that, the Internal Revenue Service will adjust the flat penalties each year for increases in cost of living.\n\nThe excess income penalty also increases. In 2015, it goes up to 2 percent of income, and in 2016 it'll be 2.5 percent.\n\nSo, in 2015, the person earning $35,000 could owe about $494, not the flat fee of $325. In 2016, that person will pay a flat fee of $625, because at that point the flat fee will be higher than 2.5 percent of income.\n\nA couple making $120,000 in 2014 might only pay a penalty of $997 in 2014. But they'll pay around $1,990 in 2015 and around $2,475 in 2016.\n\nSo, if you think the penalty for not getting insurance is only going to be $95, check your MAGI and the accompanying chart. It's likely more. It'll certainly be more in two years.\n\nIs there a calculator I can use?\n\nMr. Williams' Tax Policy Center posted a calculator earlier this year.
