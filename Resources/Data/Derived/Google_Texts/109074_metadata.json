For people who might prefer to work part time but previously couldn\u2019t afford private insurance costs, they can go to the exchanges. For employers, they may be able to hire more part-time workers and not have to shoulder the cost of providing insurance to additional staff.\n\nThe Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) could also do its part. In 1938 it established that if a worker puts in more than 40 hours a week, she has to be paid time and a half for the extra hours. But the exceptions have become so vast that the law applies to a shrinking number of people. Those who can be classified as executives, administrators, or professionals can be denied overtime pay\u2014loopholes that have been stretched ever wider thanks in part to action from President George W. Bush at the behest of business interests. The FLSA\u2019s salary threshold also hasn\u2019t been significantly updated since 1975 and stands at $23,660, meaning anyone who makes less won\u2019t get overtime. To put it simply, a lot of us who should get paid more for putting in a 40-plus hour workweek aren\u2019t.\n\nIn March, President Obama announced an executive order to update the rules, which will readjust the classification exemptions as well as the salary threshold\u2014although it\u2019s not clear by how much as it is still in public comment mode. But if the limit were raised to $50,440 a year, as proposed by the Economic Policy Institute, about ten million people would be brought into overtime protection. That wouldn\u2019t just mean extra pay in their pockets for working more hours. It could also make employers think harder about asking people to stay over 40 hours, thus bringing back the nine-to-five world we long said good-bye to.\n\nAnother shift could come from a greater adoption of work-sharing programs, which are in place in 23 states and Washington, D.C. They allow employers to reduce their workers\u2019 hours instead of laying them off when things get tight. So instead of cutting the workforce by 20 percent, an employer can shave hours by 20 percent and keep everyone on. Workers then get prorated unemployment benefits for the hours they don\u2019t work. They may still lose some income, but it\u2019s better than losing a job. \u201cIf you had more employers taking advantage of that,\u201d Baker said, \u201cit might be the case that a lot of people would say this is a good arrangement. A lot of employees might keep a four-day workweek.\u201d Included in the payroll tax cut Obama signed into law in February 2012 was money for states to either update their existing work-sharing programs or to create new ones. Work-sharing also enjoys bipartisan support, as Baker noted that he has worked with Kevin Hassett, the director of economic policy studies at AEI, to push lawmakers to enact more of these programs.\n\nWe could also, of course, simply pass laws that limit the workweek, although it\u2019s obviously a long shot in the current political climate. Yet a city in Sweden is limiting federal employees\u2019 hours to just six each workday in the hopes of boosting productivity. And in the European Union, collective bargaining has brought about countrywide limits on the workweek, with an average limit of about 38 hours as of 2012. They also all have statutory rules limiting the workweek to no more than 48 hours, with some capping it at 40. It doesn\u2019t mean people are sent to jail for putting in 49 hours, and there are plenty of ways they can work more under the rules. Still, there is a threshold that keeps the workweek in check.\n\nThese policy solutions might not be in such dire need of attention if American workers had more power to push for shorter workweeks themselves. But their power is on the decline. Just 11 percent of the private sector workforce belongs to a union. Yet it is unions whom we can thank for the 40-hour workweek supposedly enshrined in the FLSA, as well as our weekends. In the late 1800s before they came to power, the average workweek was 61 hours. Workers today don\u2019t have a lot of options if they want to work less, but a unionized group would be able to push employers to change their practices.\n\nWithout anything to stop it, though, the American workweek looks ready to keep expanding at a cost to us all.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "description": "We know by now that Americans are seriously overworked\u2014often putting in more than 65 hours at work each week.
