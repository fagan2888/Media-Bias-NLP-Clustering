Stop reading now if you haven\u2019t yet seen this hour, which packed a dramatic punch but raised troubling questions.\n\nAt first it seemed a typical courtroom-based installment, with Will Gardner (Josh Charles) arguing the innocence of a young client who, the viewer was led to think, may or may not have been so innocent. The banter from the bench included the mocking observation that the proceedings were becoming Perry Mason-like, with last minute evidence arriving, dramatically, in hopes of changing the jury\u2019s mind.\n\nIt was hardly typical TV-courtroom drama from there. This was the most shocking episode ever from this reliably smart adult drama, a CBS hour that Julianna Marguiles likes to call her little cable show on broadcast TV.\n\nEven before the shocking turn, however, the almost too kind appearance by Alicia Florrick (Marguiles) in the halls of the courthouse to warn Will that his client\u2019s parents had called her to request a second opinion raised a red flag. Would she really come to the defense of her former lover, now her competitor and enemy, with this friendly tip? Was it out of character, given what\u2019s been an extremely nasty rivalry lately? Moreover, couldn\u2019t that conversation have transpired over the phone? An awkward manipulation.\n\nMore credible was Will\u2019s heart-to-heart with Kalinda Sharma (Archie Panjabi), the tough investigator, in which he aligned himself with her \u2014 two humans who live for their intense work, who would be bored by vacation, who will always conclude that \u201clife is overrated.\u201d The scene was a beautiful capsule account of his character: by turns cold, condescending, then frankly needy, and finally sentimental and soulful, ultimately offering just the right pep talk. A great last connection.\n\nThe dramatics of final courtroom scene were well played, when the accused rages inside his head, dialog muffled, music turned up, eyeing a guard\u2019s gun. Diane Lockhart (Christine Baranski) heard shots fired from the next courtroom. The crossfire wasn\u2019t on camera but hints of the deadly results were. The sight of shaken Kalinda and Diane at the hospital was a unnerving. The misdirection \u2014 was Will in surgery? would he make it? \u2014 was well done. The sight of Will when Kalinda pulled the sheet back, looking unlike himself, was a stunner.\n\nHow the season finale on March 30 handles the investigation into the governor, Alicia\u2019s husband Peter Florrick (Chris Noth), without the presence of Will, remains to be seen. The impact on the Florrick marriage will obviously be a key plot point.\n\nHand it to the writers and producers for shaking up a series that didn\u2019t seem to need shaking up. This surprise shooting death ranks with the \u201cDownton Abbey\u201d surprise fatal carriage accident\u2013presumably another case of an actor getting antsy. Here\u2019s hoping the \u201cGood Wife\u201d team can reset for another season as cleverly plotted as the first five.\n\nJoanne Ostrow: 303-954-1830, jostrow@denverpost.com or twitter.com/ostrowdp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "\u201cThe Good Wife\u201d shocker: spoiler alert for Sunday\u2019s game changer", "title": "\u201cThe Good Wife\u201d shocker: spoiler alert for Sunday\u2019s game changer", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/03/23/the-good-wife-shocker-spoiler-alert-for-sundays-game-changer-2/", "image": {"width": 1024, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140323_103451_The-Good-Wife-Wallpaper-the-good-wife-9988962-1536-1152.jpg", "height": 768}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140323_103451_The-Good-Wife-Wallpaper-the-good-wife-9988962-1536-1152.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-03-23T23:40:28+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T00:08:40+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc949\"", "article_summary": "This surprise shooting death ranks with the \u201cDownton Abbey\u201d surprise fatal carriage accident\u2013presumably another case of an actor getting antsy.\nHand it to the writers and producers for shaking up a series that didn\u2019t seem to need shaking up.\nStop reading now if you haven\u2019t yet seen this hour, which packed a dramatic punch but raised troubling questions.\nSunday\u2019s episode of \u201cThe Good Wife,\u201d called \u201cDramatics, Your Honor,\u201d was truly a game-changer, ending core relationship within this superior drama and eliminating a key cast member.\nHere\u2019s hoping the \u201cGood Wife\u201d team can reset for another season as cleverly plotted as the first five."}
