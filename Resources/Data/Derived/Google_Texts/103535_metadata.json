He chaired the state association, the Kansas Motor Carriers.\u201d\n\nNow that he\u2019s left behind the life of a politician, Graves said the traffic was far from the only adjustment in his move to Washington.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re a governor, you have a certain amount of command and control,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not unlike probably every other trade association executive finding that there\u2019s a great frustration that things \u2026 that seem obvious to us to get done over on Capitol Hill don\u2019t get done or get done through a very long, painful process.\u201d\n\nGraves was succeeded in office by a now-controversial name in Washington, former Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius Kathleen SebeliusFighting for assisted living facilities The chaotic fight for ObamaCare California exchange CEO: Insurers \u2018throwing ObamaCare under the bus\u2019 MORE, who has become synonymous with the bumpy rollout of President Obama\u2019s signature healthcare law.\n\n\u201cShe took on a interesting challenge,\u201d Graves said.\n\nGraves has also been no stranger to controversy lately, finding himself embroiled in a fight in Congress that erupted last month over scheduling rules for truck drivers.\n\nAt issue was an attempt by lawmakers to roll back some federal requirements that drivers take time off on two consecutive nights between the hours of 1 and 5 a.m., as part of a rule that they wait at least 34 hours before starting a new shift.\n\nThe ATA and other trucking groups argued that the rules resulted in more trucks being on the highway during daylight hours, when traffic was heavier. They added that some truckers were forced to take two days off depending on when they started the 34-hour window.\n\nSafety groups vocally opposed the change to the trucker scheduling rules, which Obama administration officials said were intended to reduce fatigued driving. The opposition to undo the regulation received a boost when comedian Tracy Morgan was involved in a high-profile accident involving a truck driver.\n\nGraves said the impact of tweaking the trucker scheduling rules was being overblown by critics of the industry.\n\n\u201cWe are aware that there is going to be some controversy to almost every regulatory policy issue that we confront,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a well-known, established group of organizations who get up every day being paid to figure out how to oppose most of anything our industry is interested in.\u201d\n\nGraves said the Department of Transportation admitted during a Senate committee hearing about the trucker scheduling rules \u201cthat they haven\u2019t thought through or investigated \u2026 what the impact might be on safety with a lot of commercial traffic spilling back out onto the nation\u2019s roads.\n\n\u201cI think we felt that is a significant enough question that even the groups that consider themselves pro-safety would\u2019ve questioned the efficacy of the agency\u2019s rule,\u201d he said.\n\nGraves said trucking companies were just as interested in safety as advocates of the late-night scheduling rules.\n\n\u201cThere is no advantage to be gained in our industry by not \u2026 trying to be as safe as you can possibly be,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no gain to be had from unsafe driving.\u201d\n\nGraves added that opponents of the trucking industry should reconsider its impact on the day-to-day lives of U.S. residents.\n\n\u201cEighty percent of U.S. communities only have freight delivered by truck,\u201d he said, adding that trucking benefits \u201canybody that enjoys eating, anybody who enjoys having clothes on their back, who appreciates that medicines are available when they walk into the pharmacy.\u201d\n\nGraves and the ATA made waves in recent years by coming out in favor of an increase in the federal gas tax, which transportation advocates say could help close a $16 billion-per-year shortfall in federal infrastructure funding.\n\nGraves said he implemented a 10-year, $13 billion transportation plan when he was governor of Kansas that included two increases in the state gas tax.\n\nHe said he hopes modern-day Republican leaders can learn from his example that it\u2019s safe politically to increase transportation funding.\n\n\u201cI think the people out there still hold me in reasonable good stead because everybody appreciates mobility,\u201d he said.\n\nGraves does not agree with conservative groups in Washington that have argued for eliminating the federal government\u2019s role in transportation.\n\n\u201cThose individuals who actually have been suggesting devolution, I don\u2019t think have fully thought through the impact on interstate commerce,\u201d he said. \u201cI think they should check with governors and state legislatures to affirm that they\u2019re really desiring to cut the federal government out of transportation funding. Where I used to sit and where I now sit, I really don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good step forward for the country.\u201d\n\nGraves pointed out that previous Republican presidents have supported gas tax increases.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a Republican, I always point to Ronald Reagan,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s always considered sort of the iconic conservative Republican. Ronald Reagan understood and proposed a gas tax increase because it\u2019s the best way to fund this enormous network of roads and bridges.\u201d\n\nStill, he acknowledged that any tax increase is a tough sell in today\u2019s bitterly divided Congress.\n\n\u201cI wish we had come up with a different name for what it is we\u2019re doing as opposed to fuel tax because it really is a user fee and it has sustained the system so well for so long,\u201d Graves said.\n\nHe said he has seen a lot of changes in the way business is conducted in Washington during his time here.\n\n\u201cI was just ahead of the wave that\u2019s overtaken Washington, D.C., and the country, where it seems like there\u2019s a much greater emphasis on politics than there is on really getting public policy crafted and adopted and implemented,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Bill Graves traded in the trappings of a governorship for gridlock in and around Washington.", "description": "Bill Graves traded in the trappings of a governorship for gridlock in and around Washington.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Keith Laing", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Bill Graves traded in the trappings of a governorship for gridlock in and around Washington.", "title": "A driving force for truckers", "url": "http://thehill.com/business-a-lobbying/lobbyist-profiles/211516-a-driving-force-for-truckers", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/gravesbill_062614gn.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-02T05:39:37-05:00", "type": "article"}, "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-02T05:39-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/business-a-lobbying/lobbyist-profiles/211516-a-driving-force-for-truckers", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "dcterms.date": "2014-07-08T06:36-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Keith Laing", "dcterms.type": "Text", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-08T06:36:48-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-02T05:39:37-05:00"}, "keywords": ",Kathleen Sebelius,", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/business-a-lobbying/lobbyist-profiles/211516-a-driving-force-for-truckers", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Bill Graves traded in the trappings of a governorship for gridlock in and around Washington.", "card": "summary", "title": "A driving force for truckers"}, "dcterms.title": "A driving force for truckers"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf34a\"", "article_summary": "Safety groups vocally opposed the change to the trucker scheduling rules, which Obama administration officials said were intended to reduce fatigued driving.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no gain to be had from unsafe driving.\u201dGraves added that opponents of the trucking industry should reconsider its impact on the day-to-day lives of U.S. residents.\nThey added that some truckers were forced to take two days off depending on when they started the 34-hour window.\nGraves said trucking companies were just as interested in safety as advocates of the late-night scheduling rules.\nGraves said the impact of tweaking the trucker scheduling rules was being overblown by critics of the industry."}
