Those were about refitting existing theaters to create solid homes for classical music and theater. Those were $30 million questions.\n\nThis week, a 29-member committee, loaded with movers and shakers, begins a bigger task of deciding how the problems of a few aging venues \u2014 still functional if past their prime, no longer drawing a wide swath of citizens \u2014 can be transformed into a catalyst for an urban revival that keeps downtown the center of life in a city where large segments of the population have grown indifferent to its charms.\n\nThe Executive Leadership Team, appointed by Mayor Michael Hancock, has an expanded geography in its scope, looking for ways to tie the complex into the massive, city-owned Colorado Convention Center next door. It will consider incorporating the adjacent Sculpture Park into the arts mission, ways to leverage streets, outlying buildings \u2014 even air rights over the complex \u2014 with the potential of adding hundreds of thousands of square feet of new construction.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of material to work with, real estate-wise,\u201d as co-chair Marilee Utter from the Urban Land Institute puts it.\n\nThe committee has representation from the philanthropic community, developers, concert promoters and tourism officials as well as the downtown business association and the massive 150-acre Auraria campus just across Speer Boulevard. That puts a parcel many times the size of the current complex in play.\n\nThe committee is likely headed toward some sort of public-private partnership that could dwarf the recently completed Union Station renovation 10 blocks away. Who knows what it will come up with, perhaps something less ambitious, but one supposes the cost of the question will go up considerably.\n\nA changing downtown\n\nThe goals for an improved DPAC are many, but one sits squarely in the center: keeping downtown a cultural hub, and by extension, keeping the urban core a place that welcomes all of Denver. That\u2019s become a challenge in a city that\u2019s increasingly young and nearer every year to a minority-majority population.\n\nIt\u2019s not just that DPAC has traditionally catered to fans of Euro-centric art forms that are gradually losing appeal. It\u2019s also that things have turned increasingly expensive in the area.\n\nIt would be inflammatory to say downtown has become the playground of the wealthy. There are still plenty of good burgers around, a free bus shuttle, a Gap. But it\u2019s certainly fair to suggest things are headed in that direction. Consider: Rents for one-bedroom condos at the Spire high-rise across the street list for $2,500 a month. Dinner entr\u00e9es at the Oceanaire restaurant on the corner hover above $30. Tickets are pricey and so is parking (and so are parking tickets).\n\nSteadily, our downtown is transforming from a land of opportunity and accessibility \u2014 great concepts that defined what it means to live in the West; the reason so many of us moved here \u2014 to a place where new arrivals can hardly afford to live or play. Thanks to commercial and residential development, our downtown is safer, cleaner, healthier and decidedly more handsome, all things to celebrate. But it\u2019s also become more exclusive.\n\nCould a reimagined cultural plan \u2014 on the massive scale possible here \u2014 reverse the trend, or at least balance it? Could art lead the way to a more democratic Denver?\n\nThe need for DPAC to evolve into something more relevant to the 21st century is pressing. Art options have blossomed in the suburbs, and cultural centers in Lone Tree, Parker, Lakewood and, soon, Longmont have become serious competitors. At those places, the parking is free.\n\nThe fun part\n\nRemaking the arts complex will mean hammering out some difficult technical and financial details but it\u2019s also a chance to indulge our imaginations. How will the making and consumption of art change over the next four decades? The possibilities seem endless, even if the dollars to pay for them are not.\n\nThere are basic requirements. Theaters will have to be reconfigured to accommodate both big ballets and small contemporary dance ensembles, chamber music and comedy shows. Diversity, in everything from programming to price, is key. The current setup, dominated by 2,500-seat venues, will need to give way to flexible spaces, fully ready to convey art in the digital age.\n\nThe formal and the casual will have to coexist because demand will continue for both. Denver Arts & Venues Executive Director Kent Rice talks up a giant outdoor screen that would allow opera to be enjoyed inside while picnickers watch a broadcast on a giant lawn next door.\n\nThere might be a small amphitheater that could host a touring mariachi band one night, a poetry slam the next.\n\nBut the thinking can go further, connecting Denverites, with their particular habits, to the arts in new ways. The complex, expanded to include neighboring sites, would be sizable enough to weave in a hiking trail, volleyball or basketball courts, video games, swings, yoga studios, day-care, shopping of all sorts.\n\nWhat if we really invested and came up with a plan that diminished Speer Boulevard as the great divide of downtown and built the orchestra hall on the Auraria Campus, connecting it to the Metro State College music school. What if we carved in a bike path that crossed a bridge over Champa Street and ended at a velodrome inside one of the convention center\u2019s large rooms? Bands could play in the middle.\n\nThe dreaming is more fun than the doing, of course. Any large idea will require compromise and deal-making to attract investment. A large, privately funded hotel over the Buell Theatre would do much to activate DPAC 24 hours a day, but government would have to relinquish control of its own property.\n\nStill, the city controls real estate worth millions of dollars downtown and the chance to build tall over swank theaters would be attractive. We could take developers\u2019 money, especially if their swank new apartment buildings were architectural showpieces and they gave over their first floor for a black box theater. Entrepreneurs are more creative than bureaucrats: Let\u2019s get some good, profit-driven ideas on the table.\n\nThe key is to make deals in the public good. Not just in the interest of those who frequent the arts complex now, but those who might. Not just for those who can afford to hang out in a trendy downtown, but for anyone who wants to make the arts part of their life. The questions start with the arts, but they end in a more practical place, a city where everyone who lives here feels at home on every corner.\n\nRay Mark Rinaldi: 303-954-1540, rrinaldi@denverpost.com or twitter.com/rayrinaldi", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Dreaming big for Denver, via the arts", "title": "Dreaming big for Denver, via the arts", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/11/16/dreaming-big-for-denver-via-the-arts/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141116__20141116_E1_AE16DPACp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141116__20141116_E1_AE16DPACp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-11-16T17:55:10+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T16:06:52+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddf19\"", "article_summary": "Not just in the interest of those who frequent the arts complex now, but those who might.\nThe fun partRemaking the arts complex will mean hammering out some difficult technical and financial details but it\u2019s also a chance to indulge our imaginations.\nDenver Arts & Venues Executive Director Kent Rice talks up a giant outdoor screen that would allow opera to be enjoyed inside while picnickers watch a broadcast on a giant lawn next door.\nThis is a much grander dilemma than the ones we\u2019ve jockeyed with lately over the 4-decade-old Denver Performing Arts Complex, which begins at the corner of 14th and Curtis streets and stretches 12 full acres.\nTheaters will have to be reconfigured to accommodate both big ballets and small contemporary dance ensembles, chamber music and comedy shows."}
