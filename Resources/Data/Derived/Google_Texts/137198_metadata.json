Republicans assured us that this year they really would, seriously, roll out their alternative to Obamacare. Or, maybe, not.\n\nBut I have the sense that some political analysts still don\u2019t understand why the GOP keeps sheering away from proposing an alternative. It\u2019s not because Republican leaders are cowards. It\u2019s not because there are sharp divisions within the party about the shape of their plan. The reason Republicans haven\u2019t offered an alternative is because there is no alternative.\n\nSpecifically, if you want to propose some other, less-intrusive system that won\u2019t cause 10 or 15 or 20 million people to lose health insurance, it can\u2019t be done. The Affordable Care Act looks the way it does because it has to.\n\nMy sense is that even reformocons, who imagine themselves more open-minded than the party\u2019s base, still don\u2019t get that. But the logic has been clear from the beginning.\n\nStart with a goal almost everyone at least pretends to support: making coverage available to people with preexisting conditions. How can you do that? Well, unless you simply want to provide government insurance, you have to prohibit discrimination based on medical history by private insurers: guaranteed issue and community rating.\n\nBut just doing that isn\u2019t enough, because community rating on its own means that people don\u2019t sign up until they get sick, and you have a very poor risk pool. So you have to include an individual mandate, requiring that everyone get coverage. Note, by the way, that the individual mandate is essential in a way the employer mandate isn\u2019t.\n\nYet you can\u2019t have an individual mandate without some way of making insurance affordable for lower-income families. So the mandate has to be backed by means-tested subsidies.\n\nAnd there you are: community rating, individual mandate, subsidies \u2014 ObamaRomneycare! Everything else is details.\n\nTrue, single-payer would be an alternative, and I\u2019d be for it if I thought it had any chance of happening. But that\u2019s an alternative to the left; there is no alternative to the right.\n\nThat\u2019s why Obamacare opponents really had to stop it before it happened. As long as it was just a plan, they could insist that it was unworkable \u2014 that it would not, in fact, cover the uninsured, that costs would soar, that it would cripple the economy. And the official GOP position is indeed that the law has failed; who you gonna believe, us or your lying eyes? But none of the bad things that were supposed to happen, did. And the repeal-and-replace crowd cannot come up with an alternative, because there isn\u2019t one.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20160116124333, "BN": "krugman", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion/krugman", "DISPLAYDATE": "January 16, 2016", "keywords": "Uncategorized", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/krugman/TINA and the ACA ( 20160116 )", "PT": "Blogs", "SCG": "krugman", "sourceApp": "blogs", "twitter": {"description": "Health reform is what it has to be.", "title": "TINA and the ACA", "url": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/01/16/tina-and-the-aca/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "site": "@NytimesKrugman", "card": "summary"}, "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/krugman/post", "description": "Health reform is what it has to be.", "CG": "Opinion", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "January 16, 2016", "article": {"published_time": 1452966213, "author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/opinion/editorialsandoped/oped/columnists/paulkrugman/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Uncategorized", "modified_time": "2016-01-16T17:43:33-05:00"}, "utime": 20160116174333, "communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "PUD": 20160116, "pdate": 20160116, "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "og": {"site_name": "Paul Krugman Blog", "description": "Health reform is what it has to be.", "title": "TINA and the ACA", "url": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/01/16/tina-and-the-aca/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs_v5/../icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article"}, "communityAssetURL": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/01/16/tina-and-the-aca/", "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "TINA and the ACA", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "PST": "Blog Post"}, "article_summary": "Note, by the way, that the individual mandate is essential in a way the employer mandate isn\u2019t.\nSo you have to include an individual mandate, requiring that everyone get coverage.\nYet you can\u2019t have an individual mandate without some way of making insurance affordable for lower-income families.\nAnd there you are: community rating, individual mandate, subsidies \u2014 ObamaRomneycare!\nBut I have the sense that some political analysts still don\u2019t understand why the GOP keeps sheering away from proposing an alternative."}
