Thunderstorms roiled much of the metro area Thursday afternoon, producing weather rough enough that Denver International Airport diverted 36 flights to airports as far as Amarillo, Texas.

Hours later, the weather struck closer to home — the Broncos preseason opener against the Seatlle Seahawks was delayed during the first quarter because of lightning in the area.

DIA diverted flights to Colorado Springs, Pueblo, Fort Collins and other airports.

“We are back to normal out here. There were a total of 36 diverted aircraft during the storm. Another storm is possible tonight, but it doesn’t look as intense,” DIA spokesman Heath Montgomery said in an email at 4:40 p.m.

The storms that moved through the area dropped some one inch diameter hail near Golden, and Centennial, said Jim Kalina of the NWS.

Isolated showers are possible Thursday night, Kalina said.

The NWS issued a severe thunderstorm warning for southwest Adams, north central Douglas and east central Jefferson Counties through 1 p.m.

At about 12:30 p.m., a band of thunder storms between 5 and 8 miles wide was moving across the southwest metro area, Fredin said.

Storm clouds were laced with lightning, and dropping sizable hail.
