As holiday travelers returned home on Sunday, 159,000 passengers were expected to pass through Denver International Airport — 14,000 more than on a normal day.

“It is higher than usual, but all operations are normal today,” DIA spokeswoman Laura Coale said.

Flight tracking website FlightAware showed few delays at major airports throughout the United States.

With snow and plunging temperatures forecast, Monday could be a more challenging day for DIA, the nation’s fifth-busiest airport.

An arctic cold front is expected to push across the Eastern Plains beginning Monday morning, and 3 to 6 inches of snow are expected.

Airport personnel are expecting it to be “light, dry, fluffy snow” that is easy to remove, Coale said.

Airlines haven’t announced any precancellation of flights for Monday, Coale said.

Temperatures are expected to fall into the single digits on Monday, and lows on Monday night could be below zero.

“There is always a possibility for minor delays due to de-icing and needing time to remove snow from the runway,” Coale said.

About 161,000 passengers are expected to pass through the airport on Monday.
