During the initial rollout of the disastrous Obamacare website, the president displayed a level of patience worthy of a saint, Vice President Joe Biden quipped Friday.

“You know, it got off to a slow start,” Biden said, speaking at the National Association of Community Health Centers policy summit in Washington, D.C. “The president and I were as frustrated as anyone you ever knew. But it’s basically fixed.”

“My boss, my friend Barack Obama, is an incredibly patient man,” Biden said. “I suggested, after going through the first couple weeks, I would nominate him for sainthood that he kept his patience.”

Biden challenged members of the audience to encourage their friends and families to sign up for Obamacare, noting that the deadline for open enrollment is only two weeks away.

The White House said the number of Obamacare signups at the end of February was about 5 million — just people who have signed up for Obamacare, not people who have actually paid and are officially enrolled.
