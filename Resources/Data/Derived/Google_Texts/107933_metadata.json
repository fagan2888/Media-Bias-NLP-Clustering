Black abalone were second to be declared endangered in 2003.\n\nThe seven species of abalone that live in the waters off the California coast are white, black, green, red, pink, pinto and flat abalone. Green abalone, along with pink and pinto, are part of NOAA\u2019s Species of Concern Program, which \u201csupports proactive conservation and research,\u201d according to NOAA\u2019s website.\n\nScientists believe white abalone have difficulty sustaining their numbers in the wild because the few that are left are too far from each other to successfully reproduce. So Aquilino\u2019s team is breeding them in captivity, with the hope that the white abalone from the lab will be able to repopulate those in the wild.Learn more in the audio podcast report above.(SoundCloud background image courtesy of John Butler/NOAA)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Peninsula Press", "description": "A look at efforts to restore the population of the endangered white abalone.", "title": "Saving the endangered white abalone - Peninsula Press", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://peninsulapress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/whiteabalone.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-03-21T10:02:28+00:00", "url": "http://peninsulapress.com/2015/12/18/endangered-white-abalone/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PeninsuPress", "section": "Environment", "tag": "white abalone", "published_time": "2015-12-18T07:16:14+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-21T10:02:28+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "A look at efforts to restore the population of the endangered white abalone.", "creator": "@switchinglenses", "image": "http://peninsulapress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/whiteabalone.jpg", "title": "Saving the endangered white abalone - Peninsula Press", "site": "@PeninsuPress", "card": "summary"}, "generator": "WordPress 4.2.4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd24af\"", "article_summary": "Due to overfishing, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) declared white abalone endangered in 2001.\nKristin Aquilino, a marine scientist at Bodega Marine Laboratory, is leading the way in the effort to restore the population of the endangered white abalone.\nThe seven species of abalone that live in the waters off the California coast are white, black, green, red, pink, pinto and flat abalone.\nScientists believe white abalone have difficulty sustaining their numbers in the wild because the few that are left are too far from each other to successfully reproduce.\nBlack abalone were second to be declared endangered in 2003."}
