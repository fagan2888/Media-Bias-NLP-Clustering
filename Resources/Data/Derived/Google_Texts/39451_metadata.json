Rather than comply with the court, Virginia lawmakers launched a campaign known as \u201cMassive Resistance,\u201d and in the fall of 1958, they closed schools in three major districts for a semester to avoid having to integrate them. Prince Edward County\u2014home to Farmville\u2014shuttered all of its public schools in 1959, and they remained closed for five years. During that time, white students attended private academies paid for by their own families and sympathetic segregationists. But black students were left largely to fend for themselves, cobbling together educations in church basements and home-school settings.\n\nIn 1951, black students in Farmville, Virginia\u2014led by 16-year-old Barbara Johns\u2014staged a strike to protest conditions at Robert Russa Moton High School. The subsequent lawsuit later became one of five cases folded into Brown v. Board of Education, the landmark desegregation decision by the U.S. Supreme Court that made \u201cseparate but equal\u201d unlawful. Moton was the only one of the five cases that began with a student-led challenge.\n\nThe primary issue was the school was too small. It had been built for 180 students and they had more than 450. Classes were held in farm buildings and chicken houses\u2014 the same structures you would put an animal in. Students had to hold umbrellas when it rained because the roof leaked so badly. There would be one pot-bellied stove, and in one part of the room you\u2019d be burning up and in another you\u2019d be wearing your winter coat and shivering because the heat didn\u2019t reach that far. Students from those years talked about how often they missed school because they were sick.\n\nWhat was it like to be a student at Moton in the 1950s?\n\nThe court wanted this to be seen as a national issue, and not a southern issue. Justice Earl Warren, the former governor of California, had been appointed to the Supreme Court just two months prior to the desegregation ruling being handed down. He encouraged the other justices to make it a unanimous ruling. In his mind, the way the decision was handed down was as important as the decision itself.\n\nWhen people talk about Brown v. Board, it\u2019s usually thought of as one court case. But the Moton students actually accounted for 75 percent of the plaintiffs. So why wasn\u2019t Moton the lead case instead of Brown (a class action consisting of parents and students in Topeka, Kansas)?\n\nThe Moton School is now the Moton Museum and a National Historic Landmark, its classrooms turned into exhibits documenting the students\u2019 strike, the five-year educational drought, and the legacy of the historic Supreme Court ruling. I spoke with Justin Reid, associate director of the Moton Museum, about the Brown v. Board anniversary.\n\nIn 1963, a coalition of educators and community leaders created the Prince Edward Free School Association, and used private funds and the support of President Kennedy\u2019s administration to open four campuses serving about 1,500 black students. The 1964 Supreme Court ruling in Griffin vs. School Board of Prince Edward County forced the district\u2019s schools to finally reopen.\n\nFarmville High School, for the white students, was only a couple of blocks away so there was something to compare to. Moton had no cafeteria, no gym, no science lab, no lockers, no teachers\u2019 break room, no infirmary. Right up the street they could see all the things they were being deprived of.\n\nMoton students weren\u2019t just striking for equal buildings, they were striking for an expanded curriculum to prepare them for the workforce and college. They knew education was important, and they would do anything they could to get a quality one.\n\nWhen the free school opened in 1963, some students had been studying on their own while others had been without schooling of any kind for several years. The decision was made to group them by ability, rather than age. Are there lessons for educators today from that and some of the experimental approaches taken by the free schools?\n\nMany of the things being done in the free school that were considered radical at the time are now being used to try and close the achievement gap. The non-graded school system was certainly one of them. You can\u2019t assume a child knows something because of their age, you have to meet them where they are and start there.\n\nThere were also very small class sizes (in the free school): 15 students to every teacher. There was extended learning time, after-school programs and Saturday schools. Students had access to wraparound services: basic medical care, free breakfast and lunch. Those things are fairly commonplace now but they certainly weren\u2019t back then. It became possible only through public-private partnerships, the kind of cooperation many schools and communities are trying to build today.\n\nAre we giving the right amount of weight to the Supreme Court ruling as part of the broader narrative about the civil-rights movement?\n\nThe popular narrative is that Brown v. Board was the catalyst for the entire civil-rights movement. But that\u2019s an oversimplification. The Supreme Court didn\u2019t just wake up one day in 1954 and decide to desegregate schools. There was a massive grassroots effort that led to that decision, including two decades of legal action.\n\nIn some ways, Brown v. Board was a step sideways.\n\nThe Brown decision itself was a huge step forward: It shifted the way we viewed race as a society, and it helped us to begin to challenge what many people had long considered acceptable. But in some ways, Brown was a step sideways. The Supreme Court said in 1954 that schools should be integrated, but in the following year the court allowed the opponents (of desegregation) to frame the process.\n\nIf we\u2019d had leadership who said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to do this and make it as easy as possible,\u201d instead of fighting every step of the way, we might have seen a much different outcome. Instead, we had white families who felt compelled to leave the public system for private schools, because that\u2019s what the Southern leadership encouraged them to do. The racial tension was nurtured.\n\nDoes it surprise you that most people don\u2019t know about Moton?\n\nIt\u2019s not a surprise at all, unfortunately. Students who visit the museum often ask me \u201cWhy haven\u2019t I ever heard about this?\u201d The only people they ever learn about are Rosa Parks, Martin Luther King Jr., and Malcolm X. But the Moton legacy is actually a useful way to help students relate to that period in history. They can see themselves in the strikers and relate to Barbara Johns, the 16-year-old Moton Strike organizer who spoke up because she believed something was wrong.\n\nIt\u2019s important to know that desegregation happened in part because students were part of the movement and were doing things that some adults were afraid to do. It\u2019s a reminder to young people that they, too, can bring about change.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Seventy-five percent of the plaintiffs in the case were actually from Virginia&#39;s Moton High School, which remained in poor condition and was shuttered for several years after the ruling.", "author": "Emily Richmond", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "Seventy-five percent of the plaintiffs in the case were actually from Virginia&#39;s Moton High School, which remained in poor condition and was shuttered for several years after the ruling.", "title": "The Forgotten School in Brown v.
