US: South Bend clinic discriminated against man with HIV

hello

SOUTH BEND, Ind. -- The U.S. Justice Department says a northern Indiana pain management clinic will pay $20,000 to a person with HIV that it refused to treat to settle allegations of discrimination.

The department said Thursday that the patient sought treatment from Pain Management Care P.C. of South Bend operated by Dr. Joseph Glazier but was turned away because he was HIV-positive. The Americans with Disabilities Act prohibits health care providers from discriminating against people with disabilities including HIV.

Under a consent decree that still needs a judge's approval, Pain Management Care also must develop a non-discrimination policy, provide ADA training to its employees, submit annual reports to the federal government and pay $10,000 in civil penalties.

A message seeking comment was left for an office manager at the clinic.
