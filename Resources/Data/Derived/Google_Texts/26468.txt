Gov. Jerry Brown has vetoed a bill that would have scaled back Medi-Cal estate recovery in California, even though it passed the state Legislature with unanimous support.

In a letter to the Senate dated Thursday, Brown said that while estate protection for the next generation is a “reasonable policy goal,” the cost of the change “needs to be considered alongside other worthwhile policy changes in the budget process next year.”

My Aug. 24 column discussed the bill in depth.

Medi-Cal is the state’s version of Medicaid, a federal-state program that provides health care, including long-term care, to low-income people.

Federal law requires states to recover certain costs from the estates of deceased Medicaid/Medi-Cal beneficiaries, including the cost of nursing home and other long-term care service provided to people 55 and older. States have the option of recovering all health care costs paid by Medicaid/Medi-Cal for people 55 and older. California opted to recover all costs.

Many people who became eligible for Medi-Cal this year under the Affordable Care Act were surprised to learn their estates could be tapped for whatever the state paid for their health care starting at age 55. This is usually the premium the state pays to cover Medi-Cal recipients in managed care plans.

The bill, SB1124, would have rolled back estate recovery in California to what is required in federal law. It passed the state Senate by a 78-0 vote on Aug. 25 and the Assembly on a vote of 34-0 the next day.

The California Department of Finance opposed the bill because it would have reduced the amount of money the state recovers by $30 million the first year. The state’s share of the revenue loss, about $15 million, would have to be replenished with general fund revenues.
