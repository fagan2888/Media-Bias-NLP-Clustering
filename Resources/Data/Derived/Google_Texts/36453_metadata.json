Molinar, who was transported to Medical Center of the Rockies for emergency surgery, told officers that he'd spent the night at an apartment and had been drinking when he was stabbed, according to the arrest affidavit.\n\nMolinar was no longer listed as a patient at MCR on Friday and Loveland Police Lt. Rick Arnold was unable to provide an update on his condition.\n\nA blood trail led to an apartment in the adjacent building, 3020, where officers reportedly observed the man later identified as Tso through the sliding glass door. According to the arrest affidavit, officers entered the apartment with a key from maintenance personnel after Tso did not respond to officer's attempts to get his attention.\n\nPolice reported that Tso appeared intoxicated and later told officers that he had cut Molinar's throat with a butcher knife during a verbal altercation. He stated that he would have killed Molinar if he could have, according to the arrest affidavit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTso also allegedly admitted to removing a bloody carpet from his apartment and hiding it to get rid of the evidence.\n\nPolice arrested Tso on suspicion of attempted second-degree murder, first-degree assault, menacing and tampering with physical evidence.\n\nTso is being held at Larimer County Jail on $175,000 bond. He is scheduled for his first appearance in 8th Judicial District Court at 8:30 a.m. on March 21.\n\nContact Reporter-Herald Staff Writer Jessica Maher at or maherj@reporter-herald.com.
