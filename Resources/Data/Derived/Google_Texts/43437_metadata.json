Over at Bloomberg Politics, Peter Gosselin has a piece up quoting some members of my own \u201creform conservative\u201d tribe expressing dismay at this, and particularly at the way that Trump is killing off serious policy arguments and turning the G.O.P. primary into an exercise in substance-free showmanship. \u201cTo one degree or another,\u201d Gosselin writes, \u201cvirtually everyone in [the reformocon] circle of mostly 30-something conservatives interviewed in recent days expressed apprehension that the Republican contest could degenerate into the negative, policy-light brawl of four years ago, something party officials and policy advocates had sought to avoid.\u201d\n\nThat does sound pretty bad. But let me dissent a little from this apprehension, and offer somewhat more optimistic take. First, I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s true that Trump\u2019s campaign is substance free: Detail free, maybe, but he\u2019s clearly associated himself with a kind of nationalistic politics that bears some resemblance to the Perot phenomenon, and some resemblance to European right-populism. Trumpism as we know it basically combines broad appeals to American greatness and broad critiques of the political elite with immigration restrictionism, a critique of free trade deals, and a defense of entitlement programs. That\u2019s a combination of ideas that conspicuously lacks support within the nation\u2019s elite \u2026 but it\u2019s one that has a fair amount of popular and bipartisan appeal.\n\nIt\u2019s also a combination of ideas that appeals to precisely the socioeconomic anxieties that a lot of reform-minded conservatives think the Republican Party needs to do more to address. I\u2019ve written before about the idea that what the G.O.P. and the country need is a kind of \u201canti-Bloombergism\u201d \u2014 a centrist or center-right politics that reflects the concerns of middle American voters rather than a centrism or center-left politics focused on the favored causes of the Acela Corridor\u2019s wealthiest machers. Well, in Trumpism you have the makings of a very literal anti-Bloombergism: A billionaire-led worldview that takes the exact opposite position from the Davos/Aspen crowd on everything from immigration to trade to climate change to entitlement reform.\n\nNow of course as manifested by Trump this anti-Bloombergist spirit is crude, clownish, extreme, politically unrealistic, and so on down the list. And the danger here for reform-minded conservatives is similar to the one I discussed in the context of Mike Huckabee\u2019s \u201cMedicare today, Medicare forever\u201d campaign: That instead of a reform conservatism that devises constructive right-of-center policies that are responsive to populist/Middle American anxieties, you end up with a kind of \u201canti-reform conservatism\u201d that just basically lies to people about what\u2019s possible, promising mass deportations to immigration critics, endless entitlement spending to seniors, and never reckoning with any kind of trade-offs or dealing in reality at all.\n\nBut there\u2019s a real opportunity here for reformers as well. Because so long as a protean, ideologically-flexible figure like Trump is setting the populist agenda in the party, you\u2019re less likely to have stringent ideological tests applied to other candidates and their ideas; so long as the voter anxieties he\u2019s tapping into are front and center in the debate, you\u2019re less likely to see other candidates ignoring those anxieties while chasing support from donors or ideological enforcers instead.\n\nTake a specific issue, health care reform. Here the Republican Party was hamstrung in 2012 by its pure oppositionalism, its felt need to be as anti-Obamacare as possible, which left Romney running on the vaguest of \u201crepeal and replace\u201d conceptions and offering little or nothing to answer the valid anxieties of the uninsured. I\u2019ve been worried that something similar could happen in 2016: That the arguments advanced by Bobby Jindal, to the effect that any reform or replacement that doesn\u2019t turn the clock all the way back to 2008 is a betrayal of True Conservatism, would get traction as the default right-wing and \u201cpopulist\u201d position, and that other candidates would feel pressure to conform to that line in order to lock down conservative support.\n\nBut with Trump as the candidate of populism, promising some vague fantastic Obamacare replacement while mostly talking about other things, candidates like Scott Walker and Marco Rubio have a lot more room to offer realistic health care reforms, as both men have done, that would move the system rightward while also promising wider coverage than the status quo ante Obamacare. And while Jindal still leaped to attack them, he\u2019s polling at 1 percent and nobody particularly cares.\n\nThat kind of under-the-radar policy move is not, I admit, equivalent to the kind of exciting policy debate that I\u2019ve been urging the G.O.P. to have (in the increasingly unlikely form of a Rand-versus-Rubio primary contest, or some other fashion). But it suggests a possible future in which reform conservatives win certain policy debates without shots even really being fired; indeed, if Rubio or Walker ends up as the nominee, that\u2019s exactly what will have happened on health care. And you can imagine something similar with other issues \u2014 taxes, higher education, poverty \u2014 where Rubio has staked out a reformocon position, and where Walker or Jeb or someone else (Fiorina? Kasich?) might yet. (Rick Perry has also been doing some really interesting under-the-radar policy work, though he needs a serious political break to actually get into the race.) Instead of having the populist standard bearer (and his enablers) constantly demanding fealty to the flat tax or some other implausible right-wing ideal, you\u2019ll have Trump\u2019s media dominance creating a kind of space for policy experiments from rival candidates that they might not otherwise feel bold enough to offer.\n\nThen further, you can also imagine Trump\u2019s immigration stance tugging the G.O.P. away from the course its donor class wanted to put it on after 2012, in which the party would embrace comprehensive immigration reform in order to avoid embracing any other kind of policy change on economic issues. Reform conservatives have diverse views on immigration policy, but many of them/us endorse a kind of moderate-restrictionism around low-skilled immigration, a shift toward a more Canadian or Australian model \u2026 and there\u2019s very little question that the donorist focus on comprehensive reform is part of a \u201cchange on social issues, don\u2019t change on anything else\u201d policy approach that\u2019s pretty much the opposite of where reformocons think the G.O.P. ought to go. So while Trump\u2019s immigration rhetoric is, indeed, doing damage to one possible strategic response to the Republican Party\u2019s 2012 defeat, I\u2019ve never thought much of that response \u2014 substantively or politically \u2014 and I\u2019m confident that the broader cause of policy reform can survive its abandonment.\n\nNow I\u2019m deliberately being glass-half-full here. It\u2019s possible to imagine Trump\u2019s immigration rhetoric as a kind of poison that makes any kind of non-comprehensive, immigration-limiting approach seem toxic by association. It\u2019s possible to imagine his politics-as-showbiz approach persuading many voters that the G.O.P. is just a clown show whose entire field can be tuned out. And it\u2019s possible \u2014 very possible \u2014 to imagine his support dropping and an alternative figure like Ted Cruz rising to play more of an ideological-enforcer role against his rivals, in which case there won\u2019t be many reform conservative victories by default.\n\nBut just as, watching the debate, I wasn\u2019t persuaded that having Trump in the field was necessarily making the entire G.O.P. field look bad, I\u2019m not persuaded that his rise spells doom for my favored policy reforms either. From a reformocon perspective, Trumpism is a problem and an opportunity at once \u2014 which, at the very least, is a lot more than you could have said about what the rise of a Michelle Bachmann or a Herman Cain had to offer reformers at this time four years ago.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20150819155812, "BN": "douthat", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion/douthat", "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/douthat/post", "DISPLAYDATE": "August 19, 2015", "article": {"published_time": 1440014292, "author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/opinion/editorialsandoped/oped/columnists/rossdouthat/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Uncategorized", "modified_time": "2015-08-19T20:01:56-04:00"}, "keywords": "Huckabee Mike,Jindal Bobby,Rubio Marco,Conservatism (US Politics),Immigration and Emigration,Medicare,Presidential Election of 2016,Republican Party,Europe,Washington (DC),Uncategorized", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/douthat/How Trump Might Help Reform Conservatives ( 20150819 )", "PT": "Blogs", "SCG": "douthat", "sourceApp": "blogs", "per": "Huckabee, Mike;Jindal, Bobby;Rubio, Marco", "twitter": {"description": "Why the Donald\u2019s rise need not spell doom for Republican policy reform.", "title": "How Trump Might Help Reform Conservatives", "url": "http://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/08/19/how-trump-might-help-reform-conservatism/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "site": "@DouthatNYT", "card": "summary"}, "blogpostid": 100000003863317, "description": "Why the Donald\u2019s rise need not spell doom for Republican policy reform.", "CG": "Opinion", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "August 19, 2015", "org": "Republican Party", "geo": "Europe;Washington (DC)", "utime": 20150819200156, "communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "PUD": 20150819, "pdate": 20150819, "des": "Conservatism (US Politics);Immigration and Emigration;Medicare;Presidential Election of 2016", "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "og": {"site_name": "Ross Douthat", "description": "Why the Donald\u2019s rise need not spell doom for Republican policy reform.", "title": "How Trump Might Help Reform Conservatives", "url": "http://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/08/19/how-trump-might-help-reform-conservatism/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs_v5/../icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article"}, "communityAssetURL": "http://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/08/19/how-trump-might-help-reform-conservatism/", "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "How Trump Might Help Reform Conservatives", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "PST": "Blog Post"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb4a4\"", "article_summary": "Then further, you can also imagine Trump\u2019s immigration stance tugging the G.O.P.\nIt\u2019s possible to imagine Trump\u2019s immigration rhetoric as a kind of poison that makes any kind of non-comprehensive, immigration-limiting approach seem toxic by association.\nBut just as, watching the debate, I wasn\u2019t persuaded that having Trump in the field was necessarily making the entire G.O.P.\nNow of course as manifested by Trump this anti-Bloombergist spirit is crude, clownish, extreme, politically unrealistic, and so on down the list.\nThat kind of under-the-radar policy move is not, I admit, equivalent to the kind of exciting policy debate that I\u2019ve been urging the G.O.P."}
