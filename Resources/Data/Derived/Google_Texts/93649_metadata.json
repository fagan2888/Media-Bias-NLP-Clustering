In other words, consumers can conceivably channel surf between cable news and House of Cards\u2014all through a third party device that prevents them from being locked into a service provided by a cable company.\n\nThe FCC will now allow the public to comment on the situation before proceeding with a formal vote later this year. If the decision is upheld, observers say the brave new world could herald a big shift for the American media landscape.\n\n\n\nRight now, \"the titans, being the programmers and the distributors, control a closed echo-system. Digital companies want in on that as it is an enormous opportunity for them. Methuselah Advisors Managing Partner John Chachas told CNBC's \"Fast Money\" last week. Internet giants like Google also covet access to a cable ecosystem \"that now remains largely closed,\" he added. That may be changing, and cable providers aren't the only ones at risk, Chachas added.\n\nThe vote is likely to be met with strong resistance from companies currently operating in the closed sphere of cable set-top box technology, he said. \"The people that have already flocked to oppose this rule-making include 21st Century Fox, ABC, CBS and The Motion Picture Association of America.\"", "article_metadata": {"AssetType": "blogpost", "description": "With a vote to free boxes from the stranglehold of cable providers, the FCC may have triggered a battle between media companies of all stripes.", "author": "Brian Price", "og": {"site_name": "CNBC", "description": "With a vote to free boxes from the stranglehold of cable providers, the FCC may have triggered a battle between media companies of all stripes.", "title": "Unlocking cable boxes may spark a media war", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2016/02/19/fcc-set-box-vote-may-unleash-rumble-in-media-jungle-analysts.html", "image": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2016/02/21/103405278-GettyImages-492039870.1910x1000.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "With a vote to free boxes from the stranglehold of cable providers, the FCC may have triggered a battle between media companies of all stripes.", "title": "FCC set box vote may unleash rumble in media jungle: Analysts", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2016/02/19/fcc-set-box-vote-may-unleash-rumble-in-media-jungle-analysts.html", "image": {"src": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2016/02/21/103405278-GettyImages-492039870.1910x1000.jpg"}, "creator": "@PriceCNBC", "site": "@CNBC", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"ios": {"app_name": "CNBC Business News and Finance", "app_store_id": 398018310}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=398018310", "GOOGLEBOT": "unavailable_after: 31 Dec 9999 23:59:59 GMT", "keywords": "Fast Money, Fast Money, Government Agencies, Telecom, Stocks, Economy, Amazon.com Inc, US Economy, Charter Communications Inc, Walt Disney Co, FCC, Netflix Inc, Follow CNBC, Comcast Corp, Apple Inc, 21st Century Fox Class A, Alphabet Class A, business news", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cnbc", "published_time": "2016-02-21T15:00:00-0500", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/CNBC", "section": "Fast Money", "modified_time": "2016-02-22T06:51:29-0500", "tag": "Alphabet Class A"}, "pageNodeId": 103402831, "news_keywords": "Wheeler, FCC, Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, Disney, Cable, CBS, Fox, battle, Comcast, Charter, cable, set box, streaming"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe189c\"", "article_summary": "With a vote to free cable boxes from the stranglehold of cable providers, FCC chairman Tom Wheeler may have triggered a battle royale between media companies of all stripes.\nThe vote is likely to be met with strong resistance from companies currently operating in the closed sphere of cable set-top box technology, he said.\nThat may be changing, and cable providers aren't the only ones at risk, Chachas added.\nThe FCC will now allow the public to comment on the situation before proceeding with a formal vote later this year.\nIf the decision is upheld, observers say the brave new world could herald a big shift for the American media landscape."}
