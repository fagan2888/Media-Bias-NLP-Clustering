A Denver police officer critically injured when hit by a car during a student protest opened his eyes on Thursday, according to family.

Officer John Adsit “remains in critical condition and faces another intense, long and vital surgery today,” his family said Friday in a media statement.

Adsit was injured Dec. 3, along with three other officers, on East Colfax Avenue, as they escorted students from East High School who had marched to protest the fatal police shooting in Ferguson, Mo.

A car ran up onto a sidewalk, hitting the officers. Adsit suffered the most severe injuries.

“The incredible support we have received from friends, the Denver Police Department, and the community remains encouraging and a source of strength as John is battling through a number of setbacks,” the statement said.

The family said it will provide updates on Adsit’s condition.
