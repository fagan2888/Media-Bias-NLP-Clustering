The religious congregation operates free homes for the indigent aged through the country and the world, including Holy Family Home in West Philadelphia.

The rally, conducted by a group called Women Speak for Themselves in conjunction with the Archdiocese of Philadelphia’s Office for the New Evangelization, was objecting to the “HHS mandate,” the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services regulations under the Affordable Care Act that require employers to provide health insurance including contraception.

While such groups as the Little Sisters, the Catholic dioceses of Pittsburgh and Erie and Catholic Charities organizations, are not required to directly include contraceptive coverage, according to the federal HHS they must report the names of exempted employees to the government, which would then arrange for the coverage.

The Little Sisters and the other appellants argue this reporting mandate makes them complicit in supplying a service that is against their religious beliefs.

At the precise time of the rally at the cathedral, 10:30 a.m., the United States Supreme Court was conducting oral arguments on the case concerning the health insurance plans of church affiliated agencies, including the Little Sisters.

At the rally those in attendance heard an appropriate liturgical reading for the day from the prophet Isaiah: “The Lord is my help, therefore I am not disgraced … I shall not be put to shame, he is near who upholds my right.”

There was also a recitation of the very appropriate Chaplet of Divine Mercy and a collection of personal care items for the residents of Holy Family Home.
