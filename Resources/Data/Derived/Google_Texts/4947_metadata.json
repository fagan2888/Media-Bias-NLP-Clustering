Today, more than 100 businesses were left hanging in the rain.\n\nHoward Steel, president of the Long Branch Chamber of Commerce, said the \u201cOceanfest\u201d event has usually been a blockbuster in his 24 years organizing it, but this year it was tough to entice the same kind of crowds.\n\nAmid the rain, a magician pleaded with a group of poncho-clad girls to stay until the end of his act, an Uncle Sam impersonator on stilts ambled around the promenade gamely posing for a few pictures, and a dozen restaurant owners struggled to get a good grill groove going in the windy rain.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always been rain or shine, but this is the worst it\u2019s ever been,\u201d Steel said. (Hours later when things dried out, hundreds of people made it out to Oceanfest.)\n\nIn Point Pleasant Beach, once the skies had cleared a bit, a few hundred people turned out to play arcade games, ventured to the bars or toured the aquarium \u2013 many of them sporting umbrellas and sweatshirts.\n\nDonna Sukow and her husband and two kids sailed down from Hudson Valley, N.Y., for their first Fourth of July on the Shore. Rain or shine, she said, \u201cwe just like to get out of New York.\u201d\n\nOnly a handful would venture into the water, and the usual pyrotechnics were postponed until Sunday.\n\n\u201cAs opposed to, say, a beautiful Fourth like last year, obviously it wasn\u2019t great,\u201d said Toby Wolf, director of marketing at Jenkinson\u2019s boardwalk in Point Pleasant.\n\nShe said the beach staff was dismissed early in the day because of the rain and that the blustery forecast didn\u2019t look good for fireworks, so they were postponed until Sunday.\n\nDan George, the beach manager in Long Branch, said he put lifeguards in place early in the day, but almost no one ventured into the water, so no one had to be pulled out of any rip currents.\n\n\u201cOnce the second set of rain came through, it really discouraged even the most dedicated beachgoer,\u201d George said as he roved along the beach in a pickup truck.\n\n\u201cWe moved a couple (lifeguards) into the proper position, but really we have not seen the big surf that they were talking about yet,\u201d he said.\n\nFor Janet Debiak, a teacher from Clifton, the Shore was just fine without the sun. She was hitting the arcade games with her husband and a cousin from Austria before heading up to New York City.\n\n\u201cThis place is a blast. We come here every weekend,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to retire down here.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "'4th-of-july','@monmouth-county','@ocean-county','@shore','long-branch','point-pleasant'", "title": "Independence Day washout: Rain, wind, gloomy skies keep crowds light at the Shore", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Independence Day washout: Rain, wind, gloomy skies keep crowds light at the Shore\", \"link\": \"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2014/07/independence_day_washout_rain_wind_gloomy_skies_keep_crowds_light_at_the_jersey_shore.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/ledgerupdates_impact/photo/2014/07/04/15349549-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"13340079\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-07-04T21:50:02Z\", \"author\": \"Salvador Rizzo | The Star-Ledger\", \"tags\": [\"4th-of-july\",\"@monmouth-county\",\"@ocean-county\",\"@shore\",\"long-branch\",\"point-pleasant\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.nj.com/ledgerupdates_impact/photo/2014/07/04/15349549-thumb_square_large.jpg", "creator": "@rizzoSL", "site": "@njdotcom", "card": "summary", "description": "Beaches and businesses along the Jersey Shore were largely deserted this morning and this afternoon with the onset of heavy rain and winds"}, "article_date_updated": "Friday, July 04, 2014, 11:23 PM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"image_url\": \"http://media.nj.com/ledgerupdates_impact/photo/2014/07/04/4th-of-july-long-branch-6439b87492d4fb47.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"srizzo\", \"author_nickname\": \"Salvador Rizzo | The Star-Ledger\", \"author_id\": \"9440778\", \"source_blog_name\": \"New Jersey Real-Time News\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "NJ.com", "description": "Beaches and businesses along the Jersey Shore were largely deserted this morning and this afternoon with the onset of heavy rain and winds", "title": "Independence Day washout: Rain, wind, gloomy skies keep crowds light at the Shore", "url": "http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2014/07/independence_day_washout_rain_wind_gloomy_skies_keep_crowds_light_at_the_jersey_shore.html", "image": "http://media.nj.com/design/alpha/img/logo_njo.gif", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "NJ.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Friday, July 04, 2014,  5:54 PM", "article_author": "Salvador Rizzo | The Star-Ledger", "Description": "Beaches and businesses along the Jersey Shore were largely deserted this morning and this afternoon with the onset of heavy rain and winds"}, "article_summary": "Beachgoers in Long Branch mostly camped out inside restaurants or resorts, shunning an outdoor festival along the promenade that has drawn large crowds for nearly a quarter-century.\nHoward Steel, president of the Long Branch Chamber of Commerce, said the \u201cOceanfest\u201d event has usually been a blockbuster in his 24 years organizing it, but this year it was tough to entice the same kind of crowds.\nDonna Sukow and her husband and two kids sailed down from Hudson Valley, N.Y., for their first Fourth of July on the Shore.\n\u201cIt\u2019s always been rain or shine, but this is the worst it\u2019s ever been,\u201d Steel said.\nToday, more than 100 businesses were left hanging in the rain."}
