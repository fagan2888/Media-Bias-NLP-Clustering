CHESTERTOWN — Want to shop for health insurance? Now you can. The Affordable Care Act has transformed the insurance market by putting dozens of competing insurance plans online in one place.

The Maryland Health Connection – www.marylandhealthconnection.gov – is the statewide insurance marketplace. Anyone can compare price and coverage on the website.

Individuals who are covered by Medicare don’t need to do anything. Nothing changes for them.

For everyone else, including adults between 18 and 64 and uninsured children, the website is the place to look.

If you don’t have a computer to connect to the Internet, or can’t use a computer, you can get trained assistance from “navigators” and “assisters” by just walking in or calling. For the first two weeks in October, Kent County’s navigators will be in predetermined places.

Each private insurance company in the state health exchange has to offer four plans, which fall into categories called Bronze, Silver, Gold and Platinum. Each category corresponds to a minimum standard of benefits.

Just like the Olympics, a Bronze plan is the lowest ranked. It has the least cost and coverage.

Silver is better, Gold better still. Platinum is the “Cadillac plan.”

A navigator’s job is to help with choosing a plan, based on certain information about an individual or family.

Amanda Nelson is the lead navigator for Kent County’s region, called the Upper Eastern Shore.

Phillip Shank is Kent County’s navigator. Alison Farmer is the assister.

Hope Clark is the Queen Anne’s County navigator for those who have a Kent mailing address but live south of the river.

The Health Connection has a hotline for anyone who would like to ask questions or get additional help from a navigator. It is 855-642-8572, open from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m., Monday through Friday.

Starting today, Kent’s navigators will be at a different location in Chestertown each weekday. As time goes on, they will announce stops elsewhere in the county.

Nelson and Farmer will be at Monday night’s Chestertown council meeting at 7 p.m. in town hall.

Shank and Farmer will discuss outreach with the Kent commissioners on Tuesday, Oct. 8, at 6 p.m. at 400 High St.

•Mondays: 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Kent County Health Department, 125 S. Lynchburg St.

•Tuesdays: 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Department of Social Services office, 350 High St.

•Wednesdays: 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Kent County Public Library, Yellow Building on Calvert St.

•Thursdays: 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Shared Opportunity Service, 601 High St.

•Fridays: 8 a.m. to 3 p.m. Upper Shore Aging, Amy Lynn Ferris Center, 200 Schauber Rd.

On Oct. 28, the Maryland Health Connection Bus Tour will stop at Fountain Park from noon to 5 p.m.

To work with a navigator, it is necessary to have basic information ready. For everyone who will be on the plan, have:

•Birthdates;

•Current health insurance policy numbers, if any;

•Information about any job-related health insurance available;

•Social Security numbers;

•Document numbers for legal immigrants who need insurance.

Also, since tax rebates are used to lower the cost of insurance for people who qualify for a subsidy, bring employer and income information for everyone in your family (for example, pay stubs, W-2 forms or wage and tax statements).

Navigators work for a nonprofit agency to get people informed and signed on to health plans. For Kent County, the company is New York-based Seedco.
