For now, the city follows the lower dollar amount because Alabama is among five states that lacks its own minimum wage, according to the National Employment Law Project (NELP).\n\nUnder the ordinance, which passed by a 7-0 vote with one abstention, the wage will first rise to $8.50 on July 1, 2016, NELP and the City Council said. NELP, which supports higher pay, said that the 5 percent of Alabama state residents who earn $7.25 per hour, which is $15,080 for a person who works 40 hours per week for a full year, have not received a minimum wage increase since 2009.\n\nImmediately after the vote, workers in the city said they were elated.\n\n\u201cToo many people work for a living, and then, at the end of the day, don\u2019t have enough to do with,\u201d Birmingham resident Mercutio Southhall said, according to a video interview released by the City Council. \u201cTrying to get out of a hole, or something like that, is almost impossible.\u201d\n\nAnother resident, Sherrette Spicer, works two jobs and uses food stamps. She is looking forward to earning more money so she can cover her monthly living expenses.\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019ll be happy just to swipe my card and not have to fill out a report every six months about how poor I really am,\u201d she said in the video from the City Council.\n\nMary Jones, direct services coordinator with Greater Birmingham Ministries, explained to Birmingham news media on Aug. 19 about how the new wage will help working families and low-income individuals.\n\n\u201cThere is no decrease in food prices. Everything goes up, and I think an [employer] who really cares about his or her workers will consider the fact that their employees\u2019 needs are increasing,\u201d she said in a video from the organization.\n\nAccording to the MIT Living Wage Calculator, the $10.10 hourly pay is close to the $10.30 dollar amount that researchers say is needed to meet the \u201cliving wage\u201d definition for one adult in the Birmingham area.\n\nResearchers at MIT estimate that one adult who works in the Birmingham area needs to earn more than $21,000 per year to cover living expenses.\n\nWhile the idea to raise the minimum wage has stalled in the U.S. Congress, local officials in cities have given the green light to the idea. The cities that have bumped up pay include Los Angeles, Seattle, San Francisco, Chicago and Kansas City, Missouri.\n\nIn Birmingham, City Council President Johnathan Austin explained that elected leaders are listening to what residents are saying. \u201cPeople need to know that they have representatives who are here, fighting for their best interest, on their behalf,\u201d he said in a video statement released by the city.\n\nIn a statement, Christine Owens, executive director of New York-based NELP, praised the Birmingham City Council for supporting a higher wage, saying it will put more money in the hands of residents.\n\n\u201cThis is a first good step to turn around the future, not only of low-wage workers, but also of the city\u2019s economy, which has been struggling for a number of years,\u201d she said.\n\nCritics of having governments raise the minimum wage argue that it will harm businesses and force employers to cut back on workers because the cost of labor has increased.\n\nDouglas disagrees with that analysis. \u201cRestaurants will have more customers, buying more of their offerings, which will increase their profit. Low-income people spend their money locally,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe know that this will be tremendously helpful to families in economic crisis. It\u2019s a major step forward so that people can have basic necessities.\u201d\n\nMedia reports in Birmingham have featured business owners who support raising the minimum wage. Some studies show that raising the minimum wage has not had an adverse effect on communities. Some economists argue that cities that have strong economies are more suited to raising the wage than others.\n\nThe issues of pay and poverty continue to receive national attention, especially as the United States experiences the largest wealth gap not seen since the Gilded Age.\n\nAs of last year, the United States is home to more than 45.3 million poor people, though one government study says the number is actually higher than 49 million residents.\n\nIn the South, Louisville, Kentucky increased its hourly wage last year to $9, though that is being appealed, according to Kentuckians for the Commonwealth, a grassroots organization.\n\nIn Lexington-Fayette County, the Urban County Council was expected on Aug. 20 to begin its formal discussion of raising the hourly wage in that region to $10.10. But that Urban County Council decided to push back the discussion until September.\n\nWhile Birmingham supporters erupted into cheers after the vote, getting the proposal before local elected leaders for full consideration took several steps and much work from residents, Douglas said, adding that the city has done much in the past to fight for civil rights and support immigrants.\n\nIn February, supporters of the \u201cFight for $15\u201d movement, which argues that fast-food and other restaurant workers should earn that amount, held rallies in Birmingham.\n\nThose rallies created momentum for change in the city, and they continued through June, Douglas said. During this period, residents and grassroots organizations began speaking with members of the City Council about higher pay and fighting poverty.\n\nWith the help of NELP, Douglas said, residents, grassroots organizations, labor groups and faith leaders worked on drafting a minimum wage ordinance.\n\n\u201cAt the time, people were saying that Birmingham couldn\u2019t do it, that it was unconstitutional under the state Constitution,\u201d he said. \u201cBut Alabama\u2019s Constitution constricts counties. It gave powers to the cities, including the power to provide for the public.\u201d\n\nIn April, Douglas said, the City Council approved a nonbinding resolution to increase the minimum wage. The signs of possible success were getting clearer.\n\nAbout six weeks ago, supporters thought the City Council would consider the ordinance. There was much back and forth, Douglas recalled, and residents contacted their elected leaders to voice support for better pay.\n\nAll of this finally led to the Aug. 19 vote. The city\u2019s law department is now reviewing the wage increase.\n\nDouglas has a slight concern that this review period will give opponents of raising the wage time to stop its implementation.\n\nAfter the law department finishes its review and should the ordinance go into effect, Douglas said the next step would be to make sure that employers follow what the law requires.\n\n\u201cStill, this is in our best tradition because it would not have happened if community folks were not organized,\u201d he said.\n\n___________\n\nBrad Wong is news editor for Equal Voice News.\n\n2015 \u00a9 Equal Voice for America\u2019s Families Newspaper", "article_metadata": {"description": "Equal Voice News covers news about America's working families, poverty and policy.
