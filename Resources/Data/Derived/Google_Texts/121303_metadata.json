Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., had blocked the measure from being voted on.\n\nSupporters of the Freedom Act argue the legislation appropriately balances security and privacy. Some opponents of the legislation believe it is still too intrusive and violates civil liberties. Others, like Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell believe the amended program will put the nation\u2019s security at risk by limiting key counterterrorism tools.\n\nSeveral amendments that had been advocated by McConnell, R-Ky., to the House-passed bill failed.\n\nMcConnell said on the Senate floor that \u201cI cannot support passage of the so called USA Freedom Act.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt does not enhance the privacy protections of American citizens. And it surely undermines American security by taking one more tool from our warfighters at exactly the wrong time,\u201d McConnell said.\n\n>>> Senate roll call vote for USA Freedom Act\n\nSens. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., and Rand Paul, R-Ky., jointly introduced nine amendments to the Freedom Act. According to a press release by Wyden\u2019s office, the senators were seeking to \u201cstrengthen privacy protections.\u201d\n\nIn remarks on the Senate floor, Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., urged his colleagues to pass the bill so that the president could \u201csign it tonight.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the floor after the bill\u2019s passage, Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., said Congress has ended the government\u2019s bulk collection of data \u201conce and for all.\u201d\n\nWyden praised the Senate\u2019s passage of the bill in a statement after the vote.\n\n\u201cIt is not an exaggeration to say the passage of the USA Freedom Act is the most significant victory for Americans\u2019 privacy rights in more than a decade, and stands as a true endorsement of the principle that Americans do not need to sacrifice their liberty to have security,\u201d Wyden said.\n\n\u201cI cannot support passage of the so called USA Freedom Act.\u201d http://t.co/osS9YjVweW \u2014 Leader McConnell (@SenateMajLdr) June 2, 2015\n\nGood news! https://t.co/Dr5MV7xLD5 \u2014 Mike Lee (@SenMikeLee) June 2, 2015\n\nGood news! https://t.co/Dr5MV7xLD5 \u2014 Mike Lee (@SenMikeLee) June 2, 2015\n\npic.twitter.com/i7shtWLvp0 \u2014 Sen.
