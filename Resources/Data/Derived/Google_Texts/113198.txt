A Houston precision medicine match-making startup is branching out past patients and physicians – creating a pharmacogenomics software meant specifically for pathology labs.

MolecularMatch to date has operated a public-facing search engine that helps physicians and cancer patients learn more about treatment options. Working a touch like Google, the engine essentially uses artificial intelligence to meld data from ClinicalTrials.gov with disease specifics to provide a tool that can fine tune cancer therapy.

The new tool, MM Lab, is building on data from the public-facing search engine to match the patient’s exact genetic cancer type to the best known treatment option. It indexes clinical trials, drug and medical databases, as well as information from individual drug labels and scientific journals to pop up with the same query. Indeed, MolecularMatch says this “includes 300,000 biomedical documents checked against more than 700,000 biomedical facts – resulting in nearly 2.5 billion indexed combinations.”

MolecularMatch is targeting next-generation sequencing labs for its lab-facing software. Coker cited Biodesix, Foundation Medicine, Trovagene and Guardant Health as current or potential customers.

The company’s raised about $4 million from a network of angel investors in the Houston area, CEO Kevin Coker said in an interview. MolecularMatch is currently raising a Series B round, looking to bring in $11 million.
