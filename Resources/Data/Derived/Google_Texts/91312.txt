The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has started a civil investigation into Herbalife Ltd., the company said Wednesday.

The maker of nutritional supplements didn’t reveal the nature of the investigation; however, Herbalife has been accused of operating as a pyramid scheme. The company has repeatedly denied such allegations and has defended its business model on several occasions.

“Herbalife welcomes the inquiry given the tremendous amount of misinformation in the marketplace, and will cooperate fully with the FTC,” the company said in a news release Wednesday. “We are confident that Herbalife is in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.”

The company added that it doesn’t plan to make further comments on this matter until there are material developments. Read the full WSJ story here.

An FTC representative confirmed the agency’s investigation but declined to comment further.

Herbalife shares, which had risen as high as $69.41 Wednesday before the news, hit a low of $54.59 after disclosing the investigation. The stock later rebounded a bit, again trading above $60.

Herbalife sells a range of products, including weight-loss shakes and fitness supplements, through a wide global network of independent distributors.

The company has been under pressure regarding its business model by Pershing Square Capital Management LP’s William Ackman, who has pressed lawmakers and regulators to investigate the company.

In December 2012, Mr. Ackman announced he had made a $1 billion bet that the company’s stock price would fall. Since then, Herbalife’s shares have risen, causing a big loss for the investor, and Mr. Ackman’s stance has drawn harsh criticism from fellow hedge-fund managers, including Carl Icahn and Daniel Loeb.

Tuesday, Mr. Ackman reiterated his opinion that Herbalife was a pyramid scheme, and he said the company was guilty of violations in China.

A Pershing Square spokesman declined to comment Wednesday, and Mr. Icahn was unavailable.
