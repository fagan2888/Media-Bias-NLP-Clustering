Rick Santorum says he was “sickened” to learn reality TV star Josh Duggar allegedly molested underage girls, including his own sisters, when he was a teenager.

“I was sickened by it. I was just sickened by it,” the Republican presidential candidate told ABC’s “Good Morning America” in an interview that aired Thursday.

“I pray for those girls in particular,” Mr. Santorum said. “To have gone through that is … just hard to think about.”

In Touch magazine last week published a years-old police report alleging that Mr. Duggar confessed to “forcibly fondling” several minors, including his sisters, when he was 14 and 15. Mr. Duggar, 27, who has appeared with his family on TLC’s “19 Kids and Counting,” resigned from his position with the Family Research Council after the magazine’s story was released and issued a statement on the family’s Facebook page admitting to unspecified bad behavior as a teen.

In the wake of the public outcry over the allegations, TLC pulled “19 Kids and Counting” from its schedule. Hulu has also pulled streaming episodes of the show, The Hill reported.

On Friday, fellow Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee came to Mr. Duggar’s defense, slamming the “bloodthirsty” media for sensationalizing the story.
