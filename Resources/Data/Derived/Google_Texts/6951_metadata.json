As Dave Weigel has noted, from time to time, champions of the lawsuit acknowledge their real goal is to destroy the law by any means necessary, a frank admission of the goals of this particular exercise in right wing legal activism.\n\nBut now this link between the lawsuit and the goal of taking down the law has been drawn tightly by none other than the incoming GOP Senate Majority Leader.\n\nIn a very candid moment, Mitch McConnell flatly describes this legal challenge as a substitute means through which an end \u2014 repeal \u2014 will be accomplished that Republicans failed to accomplish through the political and legislative process.\n\nThe moment, which was flagged by a Democrat, comes in an interview that McConnell gave to the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Gerald Seib this morning (see second video). Seib notes that some Republicans have advocated for repeal, and asks: \u201cHow do you approach the Affordable Care Act now?\u201d McConnell answers (emphasis added):\n\n\u201cIt bears the president\u2019s name. The chances of his signing a full repeal are pretty limited. There are parts of it that are extremely toxic with the American people. The elimination of the 40 hour work week. The individual mandate. The medical device tax. The health insurance tax. I think you could anticipate those kinds of things being voted on in the Senate. Such votes have not been allowed in the past. \u201cWho may ultimately take it down is the Supreme Court of the United States. I mean there\u2019s a very significant case that will be decided before June on the question of whether the language of the law means what the language of the law says, which is that subsidies are only available for states that set up state exchanges. Many states have not. If that were to be the case, I would assume that you could have a mulligan here, a major do-over of the whole thing \u2014 that opportunity presented to us by the Supreme Court, as opposed to actually getting the president to sign a full repeal, which is not likely to happen.\u201d\n\nMcConnell suggests the new GOP-controlled Senate will vote to repeal parts of the law, but acknowledges legislative repeal is unlikely to succeed, before stating that there is now a real possibility that instead, the Supreme Court will \u201ctake it down,\u201d giving \u201cus\u201d the opportunity of a \u201cmulligan\u201d and a \u201cmajor do-over of the whole thing.\u201d Even if McConnell is simply describing this as the objective outcome that will result from a SCOTUS decision against the law, it represents a noteworthy level of candor.\n\nOn the legal argument, McConnell says the \u201clanguage of the law\u201d unambiguously \u201csays\u201d that \u201csubsidies are only available for states that set up state exchanges.\u201d That claim \u2014 that the key phrase \u201cestablished by the state\u201d means Congress did not extend subsidies to people in the three dozen states on the federal exchange \u2014 has already been widely challenged by legal observers. They note that even a purely textual interpretation of the whole law \u2014 putting the contested phrase in its broader statutory context \u2014 upholds the government\u2019s interpretation of the disputed phrase, and not that of the challengers.\n\nSome, such as Brian Beutler, have argued that read in context, the key phrase unambiguously supports the reading that Congress intended the law to make subsidies available to people in all states. Others have argued that even if the phrase\u2019s meaning in context is merely ambiguous, the court should side with the government.\n\nIn this context, McConnell\u2019s new quote takes on particular interest. As law professor Nicholas Bagley notes in his response to the challengers\u2019 claim, even if you grant that the challengers\u2019 reading of the phrase is reasonable, the government\u2019s reading of it in context can also be reasonable. Which presents the court with a challenge, as Bagley notes:\n\nEven if you think [the challengers\u2019] claim is plausible, maybe even attractive, the contrary interpretation offered by the government is at least reasonable. That brings me to the scope of their argument that troubles me the most: their unyielding conviction that they\u2019ve identified the only possible construction of the ACA. Nowhere do they acknowledge that maybe, just maybe, they\u2019re wrong. That\u2019s because they can\u2019t admit to doubt. Because of the deference extended to agency interpretation, doubt means they lose. But their unwillingness even to acknowledge ambiguity reflects an important difference between legal advocacy and neutral interpretation. To be clear, [the challengers] deserve immense credit for their lawyerly ingenuity: they\u2019ve constructed a facially plausible argument in support of an exceedingly strange interpretation of the ACA. But the courts would violate their obligation of fidelity in statutory construction if they mistook that ingenuity for genuine obeisance to Congressional will. The latest challenge to the ACA is political activism masquerading as statutory restraint.\n\nAsked for comment on McConnell\u2019s latest, Bagley told me:", "article_metadata": {"description": "A moment of striking candor about the latest legal challenge to the ACA.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/WashingtonPostPlumLine?ref=hl", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "A moment of striking candor about the latest legal challenge to the ACA.", "title": "Mitch McConnell: We can\u2019t repeal Obamacare, but Supreme Court may \u2018take it down\u2019 instead", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2014/12/02/mitch-mcconnell-we-cant-repeal-obamacare-but-supreme-court-may-take-it-down-instead/", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=http://img.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/files/2013/04/blog_mcconnell.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@theplumlinegs"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2014/12/02/mitch-mcconnell-we-cant-repeal-obamacare-but-supreme-court-may-take-it-down-instead/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "obamacare, supreme court, legal challenge to Obamacare, halbig, king v burwell, mitch mcconnell, gop senate majority, affordable care act", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/WashingtonPostPlumLine?ref=hl"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "obamacare, supreme court, legal challenge to Obamacare, halbig, king v burwell, mitch mcconnell, gop senate majority, affordable care act"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWho may ultimately take it down is the Supreme Court of the United States.\nSeib notes that some Republicans have advocated for repeal, and asks: \u201cHow do you approach the Affordable Care Act now?\u201d McConnell answers (emphasis added):\u201cIt bears the president\u2019s name.\nOthers have argued that even if the phrase\u2019s meaning in context is merely ambiguous, the court should side with the government.\nIn a very candid moment, Mitch McConnell flatly describes this legal challenge as a substitute means through which an end \u2014 repeal \u2014 will be accomplished that Republicans failed to accomplish through the political and legislative process.\nThe current legal challenge that could gut Obamacare subsidies in three dozen states is regularly described by its proponents as an effort to enforce the law as written."}
