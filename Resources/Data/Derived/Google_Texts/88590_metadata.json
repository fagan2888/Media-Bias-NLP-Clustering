The auditors focused on a small group of the tax agency\u2019s top executives who had drummed up astronomical travel expenses commuting to work in Washington each month by plane from their homes in Dallas, Atlanta and Minneapolis. The report said the top 15 travelers combined spent more than $1 million taxpayer dollars, and each traveled for more than 200 days between fiscal 2011 and 2012.\n\nRelated: IRS Flubs It Again: Pays $4 Billion to Tax Thieves\n\nThis is a very small percentage of IRS employees\u2014at least 60 percent of the agency\u2019s workers live in the DC metro area. They are, however, at the top of the executive pyramid.\n\nStill, TIGTA said that up until January 2012, the IRS had no controls in place to make sure travelers and managers properly identified and reported the travel expenses.\n\n\u201cWithout an effective periodic assessment and management review of the executives\u2019 travel activities, the IRS cannot ensure that its executives\u2019 travel reimbursements are properly classified,\u201d said J. Russell George, Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration.\n\nThe inspector general recommended that the IRS begin documenting the protocol for reviews and sending out an annual reminder to employees of its policies with regard to taxable long-time travel.\n\nIRS management agreed with TIGTA\u2019s recommendations and said the agency will take appropriate corrective actions.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Last summer,", "title": "IRS Travelgate: Executives Flout Tax Rules", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/02/20/IRS-Travelgate-Executives-Flout-Tax-Rules", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/05162013_IRS_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/02/20/IRS-Travelgate-Executives-Flout-Tax-Rules", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/05162013_IRS_article.jpg", "creator": "@Briannaehley", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Last summer,", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe085e\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWithout an effective periodic assessment and management review of the executives\u2019 travel activities, the IRS cannot ensure that its executives\u2019 travel reimbursements are properly classified,\u201d said J.
