Department store chain Sears and drugstore chain Walgreens are sending their workers to private exchanges.\n\nAlcoa spokeswoman Melissa Lelii confirmed on Monday that salaried retirees will be moved to a private exchange set up by Towers Watson, a consulting firm that runs private exchanges. She declined to provide any other details, including how many people are affected by the change, how benefits may change or how much Alcoa's contribution to health benefits would be reduced.\n\nLelii said the majority of retirees \u201cwill see a greater benefit with the health care exchange options\u201d but declined to provide specifics.\n\nTypically, private exchanges are set up by a consulting company or an insurance carrier and offer a broad range of health plans. Employers contribute a set amount that may cover most or all of the cost of a basic plan. It's up to the worker or retiree to pay for a higher level of coverage.\n\n\u201cIf they want the Cadillac plan, they may have to kick in more money than they are paying today,\u201d said J.T. Shilling, head of the Pittsburgh office of benefits consulting firm Mercer. \u201cBut at least they have the option rather than the company just saying, \u2018We're going to cut benefits.' \u201d\n\nThough not commonplace, Shilling said, nearly every company is asking itself whether a private exchange makes sense as a way to continue offering health benefits to employees.\n\nInterest has picked up since the inauguration of HealthCare.gov, the government's online exchange set up under President Obama's health law.\n\n\u201cThe public exchanges opened people's eyes to the power of shopping and the power of choice,\u201d Shilling said.\n\nPrivate exchanges may help employers avoid a 40 percent excise tax on high-value health plans that will take effect in 2018, according to Towers Watson.\n\nThe firm estimates that three out of five large employers will be subject to the so-called Cadillac tax if they don't take steps to reduce their contribution to health benefits.\n\nAlcoa, which is based in New York but has an operations center in Pittsburgh, may have been able to provide rich employee benefits in the past, but it is facing serious competitive pressure today, said John Tumazos of Tumazos Very Independent Research in Holmdel, N.J.\n\nThere is an oversupply of aluminum caused by increasing Chinese production, which has depressed the metal's price, he said. Alcoa has responded by closing smelters across the nation and trimming expenses.\n\n\u201cThey're not the pre-eminent company they once were,\u201d he said. \u201cThey haven't taken the controls off of cost. They're still attacking any and every cost.\u201d\n\nAlcoa will host information meetings on the changes on Oct. 1 and 2 at the DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel in Green Tree.\n\nAlex Nixon is a staff writer for Trib Total Media.
