Employers would have to pay time-and-a-half for any overtime hours.\n\nThe agency announced the final rules this week and they would take effect Dec. 1 unless Congress blocks the rule.\n\nThe change would apply to about 73,000 managers in Colorado, according to a White House estimate.\n\nAdvocates argue that the change is overdue and needed to ensure people are paid for hours worked and to ensure businesses don\u2019t take advantage of salaried employees. Critics say businesses and nonprofits cannot absorb the change.\n\n\u201cMany people are placed in managerial positions and are short-changed because they are exempt from overtime. The title or promotion really doesn\u2019t mean much when people have to work long hours and are not properly compensated,\u201d said the Maureen Maliszewski, director of the La Plata County Thrive! Living Wage Coalition.\n\nHowever, some human resource managers said the change may be too sweeping because it more than doubles the current cap and it applies to nonprofits.\n\nAt Tri-County Head Start, a federally funded nonprofit, the change would affect all the administrators and specialists, who work many hours of overtime because they are committed, said Clark, the nonprofit\u2019s human resource manager.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to really restrict what they can and can\u2019t do, and it could have an overall impact on the overall quality,\u201d she said.\n\nHead Start cannot afford to pay overtime or increase salaries because they do not receive enough federal funding, she said.\n\nOther small nonprofits and businesses may face a similar challenges.\n\nThe new salary rule and increased health care costs driven by Affordable Care Act, also known Obamacare, may influence hiring decisions. Business could limit how many people they hire or hire part-time employees instead of full-time, said Danielle Kirkpatrick, president of the Durango Area Human Resource Managers.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not going to be able to afford the same amount of employees. ... That will have an impact on local jobs,\u201d she said.\n\nIt may have the largest effect on small businesses that do not have a human resource manager to monitor the laws.\n\n\u201cThey haven\u2019t had the time to prepare,\u201d she said.\n\nThe salary limit hasn\u2019t been updated since 2004. So it may be appropriate to raise it, said Laura Lewis Marchino, deputy director of the <URL destination=\"http://www.scan.org/\">Region 9 Economic Development District.\n\n</URL>However, it is too soon to know if compliance requirements are going to be burdensome for businesses, said Marchino, who has not taken a position on the rule.\n\nThe rule could also be seen as a matter of fairness for those working 50 hours a week who are still struggling financially, said state Rep. Max Tyler, D-Lakewood, who introduced a law last year similar to the federal rule.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.durangoherald.com/article/20160521/NEWS01/160529943/", "site_name": "The Durango Herald", "image": "http://durangoherald.com/storyimage/DU/20160521/NEWS01/160529943/AR/0/AR-160529943.jpg?maxw=1000&imageversion=16by9", "type": "article", "title": "Overtime pay a matter of fairness, tough for businesses"}, "fb": {"app_id": 263076300371367, "pages": 205518469520233}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1621\"", "article_summary": "Employers would have to pay time-and-a-half for any overtime hours.\nFederal rules that would extend overtime pay to mid-level managers would put pressure on Durango businesses to change their practices.\nThe new salary rule and increased health care costs driven by Affordable Care Act, also known Obamacare, may influence hiring decisions.\nIt may have the largest effect on small businesses that do not have a human resource manager to monitor the laws.\nBusiness could limit how many people they hire or hire part-time employees instead of full-time, said Danielle Kirkpatrick, president of the Durango Area Human Resource Managers."}
