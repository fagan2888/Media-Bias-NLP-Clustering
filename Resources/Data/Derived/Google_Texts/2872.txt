A local pharmacy closed Saturday afternoon following an accident.

Greenville police arrived to the Realo Pharmacy on East Fire Tower Road around 2 p.m. after a car appeared to have crashed into the front of the building.

We're working to get more information on exactly how it happened and if any injuries were reported.

The front of the building is currently boarded up. No word yet on when they'll reopen.

We have calls out to GPD and will update you as soon as information becomes available.
