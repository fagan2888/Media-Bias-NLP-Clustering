CHICAGO — A robbery was thwarted at a store on Chicago’s south side on Halloween night (Saturday, October 31st) when a concealed carry license holder shot and killed a suspect.

The Chicago Tribune is reporting the deceased has been identified as 55-year-old Reginald Gildersleeve of Chicago.

Officials with the Cook County Medical Examiner’s Office tell the Chicago Tribune Gildersleeve was pronounced dead at the scene Sunday evening.

Police say Gildersleeve walked into the store near 51st and Washtenaw Avenue around 7:00 p.m. Saturday, and announced a robbery to an employee behind the counter — displaying a handgun.

Another employee came from the back of the store, and the gunman pointed his weapon at this female employee. Police say Gildersleeve then made the female employee go to the back of the store, which serves as a currency exchange, the Chicago Tribune reports.

Then, a customer inside the store pulled out a weapon and fired at the suspect — killing him. The armed customer shot the man multiple times, according to the Chicago Sun-Times.

Police say this customer has a valid concealed carry license, and a valid firearm owner’s identification card.

It isn’t clear if the customer, who has not been identified, will face charges. The case is under review by local prosecutors. Preliminary details suggest that the customer is not at fault.
