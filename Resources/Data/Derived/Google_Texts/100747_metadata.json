Not only will this bill help gay couples build their families through surrogacy, it will also open this family-building option to all New York couples who are diagnosed with infertility and choose to use a gestational carrier to build their family.\n\nWhy would someone with infertility need a gestational carrier to have a baby? Perhaps cancer has taken a woman\u2019s uterus, she has abnormalities of her reproductive organs, or she suffers from another health condition where pregnancy would negatively impact her health and well-being.\n\nJust because she lives in New York State, gestational carrier surrogacy is not open to her and her partner, nor do the current laws provide all the protections necessary for the intended parents, gestational carrier, and most of all, the newborn child. Barbara Collura, President/CEO, RESOLVE: The National Infertility Association\n\nA poem for Martin\n\nBronx: Martin Luther King has long been at rest. He joined Kennedy, Lincoln and all of the best. St. Peter can\u2019t say, \u201cYou\u2019re not allowed here, \u2019cause you\u2019re black and we\u2019re white.\u201d No segregation up there. When we\u2019re destined to die, we all die the same. Regardless of color or poorness or fame, we all end up buried in one way or another. So remember this, mister: You are my brother. But how can you know resentment if you weren\u2019t born black? Has a man ever told you, \u201cHey, you, get to the back\u201d? King had a vision that someday this would cease, and his children would live in a world full of peace. For some people, I know, this is hard to conceive, but some day men will be judged not by color but deed. Catherine Santarpia\n\nNot child\u2019s play\n\nBrooklyn: Some call pre-K for 4-year-olds \u201ctaxpayer-funded day care.\u201d As a recently retired Education Department pre-K teacher, I\u2019d like to know where they \u201clearned\u201d this information. I taught reading, writing, math, science and social studies. I taught music and art. I was required to meet pre-K Common Core learning standards. Rigor was the buzzword. The students learned to sit, raise hands and participate in lessons \u2014 no easy task for 4-year-olds. (Did I mention that most children in each of my classes were non-English-speaking students?) Perhaps we expect too much, too soon. By the way, by the time the 5-year-olds get to kindergarten, there is practically no time for play. Gail Seif\n\nA Bill of goods\n\nAstoria: Bill de Blasio has to be the first person to win an election promising to raise taxes! I\u2019m not in the upper crust, but I\u2019ve seen enough waste in this city to know that it needs to be eliminated before anyone is taxed any further. And before any money is spent on pre-K for 3- and 4-year-olds \u2014 who belong home with at least one parent, enjoying just being a kid \u2014 the city should use some of those funds to clean up the streets. Tale of two cities? You bet it\u2019s been that. How do billion-dollar apartment towers get built with 25- and 30-year tax abatements? Vincent Scaldaferri\n\nWhere\u2019s the outrage?\n\nBrooklyn: After reading all the fuss about Gov. Christie\u2019s \u201cmistake,\u201d I wonder why the same fuss is not made about the pack of criminals in Washington who take money from anyone with a cause, give themselves pay raises, waste our money, etc. Where are the calls for impeachment? Leslie Hulkower\n\nGet over it\n\nJamaica: To all you Voicers: You cannot compare Gov. Christie\u2019s job to President Obama\u2019s job. Christie deals with the state of New Jersey, and Obama works for all people in the United States. I wish you all would get over Fast and Furious, Benghazi, IRS and the Affordable Care Act (which some of you are calling Obamacare). You all need to get a life and help poor and middle-class Americans. Let Christie\u2019s fate be in the hands of the courts and attorneys. Soon the truth will be told. Obama is trying to help all the people in the United States, not just the rich. Charlene Black\n\nO Captain! My Captain!\n\nDouglaston: I can\u2019t believe Tom Hanks was not nominated for best actor for \u201cCaptain Phillips.\u201d What a disgrace! He did a superb job. I guess a great performance by a really decent guy doesn\u2019t cut it in Hollywood. Irene Hughes\n\nPot, meet kettle\n\nBaldwin, L.I.: S.E. Cupp makes good points about marijuana and gun control policies (\u201cPot could put progressives in a tough spot,\u201d Jan. 7). But while the theory that less control leads to more safety is iffy when speaking about guns, it\u2019s quite true for marijuana. With legalization, many users may stop because they only sought the edgy, rebellious rush that came with smoking the illegal substance. Another benefit is the taxes to be raked in. As long as there are specific regulations and restrictions, like age and general mental and physical health, I don\u2019t see a real downside to the legalization of marijuana. Celeena Carrington\n\nWhy?\n\nForest Hills: Why was Myls Dobson awarded to his father, who had a rap sheet of 13 arrests? Why didn\u2019t the judge notify the Administration for Children\u2019s Services or give the child to a grandmother or aunt or uncle? Why did this stupid father give his child to a woman he barely knew? Did she enjoy starving and beating him? Was she on drugs? She deserves to be in prison for life. Didn\u2019t someone see the child out on the balcony in the bitter cold, and if so, why didn\u2019t they call the police? What is wrong with the people in this world? Lillian Zimmerman\n\nWhen?\n\nStaten Island: My heart goes out to little Myls Dobson and any family member who actually cared about him. I wonder how long it will be before the family announces a multi-million-dollar lawsuit. Keep in mind, this is the same family that was not too concerned about the welfare or whereabouts of this poor child until he died. John L. Patane\n\nBlack-and-white TV\n\nNorth Massapequa, L.I.: In a commercial for the movie \u201cRide Along,\u201d a black man makes fun of white people. A satellite TV commercial depicts a riot scene with looting; the looter is an elderly white man who then gets mugged by, that\u2019s right, another white man. An insurance company commercial shows a house break-in where two people are stealing property; not one but both robbers are white. If any of these situations were reversed, there would be outrage, apologies and community activists holding press conferences. The political correctness has gotten ridiculous. James Jacobs\n\nAn education\n\nManhattan: I\u2019m confused. If rent is charged to some charter schools, will this mean less money goes into Eva Moskowitz\u2019s pocket? Also, the Daily News compares charter school test scores and public school test scores on a regular basis \u2014 but don\u2019t they have different populations? For example, some lower-performing students don\u2019t last in charter schools but have to be taken in by public schools. Does this not skew the data? Mitch Chaitin\n\nHorse sense\n\nBloomfield, N.J.: Why hasn\u2019t anyone considered the condition of the city\u2019s mounted police animals? Can their housing and work conditions be much different than those of carriage horses? They walk the same streets, and I am sure, if there is good reason, they are called upon to work unusually long hours. Fred Naturale\n\nBaby boom\n\nManhattan: Voicer Frances Villardi\u2019s belief that God made man and woman so they could procreate is narrow-minded and archaic. With more than 7 billion people on this earth and a baby being born every 8 seconds, our earth is already bursting at the seams. As far as I see it, gay people are doing us all a favor! Mas Ichida\n\nIt is written\n\nBrooklyn: To Voicer Sarah Alboher, who has wondered all her life why Jews do not celebrate Christmas: Perhaps you should be asking yourself why Christians do not celebrate all of the Jewish holidays, as Jesus himself did. Jesus was a real historical person, who was born, lived and died as a Jew in the land of Israel during the Roman occupation. His name was actually pronounced \u201cYeshua,\u201d and his followers, who were also Jewish, called him \u201crabbi.\u201d He lived a Jewish life from the time of his birth to his last Passover seder \u2014 which you know as the \u201cLast Supper\u201d \u2014 and he tried to teach others how to do the same. So why do we, as Christians and believers in Jesus, not follow his example?
