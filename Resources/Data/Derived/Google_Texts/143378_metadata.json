Sign up here.**\n\nBuzz Cut:\n\n\u2022 Shorter Obama: Don\u2019t worry, distancing Dems are lying\n\n\u2022 Shaheen shifts stance on Ebola ban\n\n\u2022 New PAC ties Obama golf to national security blunders\n\n\u2022 No Labels: Manchin in ad that calls Republican a \u2018prostitute\u2019\n\n\u2022 You gotta start somewhere\n\nSHORTER OBAMA: DON\u2019T WORRY, DISTANCING DEMS ARE LYING\n\nIf you didn\u2019t know better, you\u2019d think that President Obama was actually trying to hurt red-state Democrats. First he contradicted the candidates in a dozen Senate races from Alaska to Georgia who claimed his policies weren\u2019t on the ballot. \u201cMake no mistake,\u201d the president said at a campaign stop on Oct. 2, \u201c[his] policies are on the ballot. Every single one of them.\u201d The message: A vote for a Democrat is a vote for his agenda. Pretty bad when the president\u2019s policies are consistently unpopular, right? And viewers are already hearing the line repeated in campaign ads. But Democrats were at least still free to disagree with him and highlight their disagreements. Back in Chicago on Monday, though, Obama closed off even that line of retreat.\n\n\n\nIn an interview with Al Sharpton, an MSNBC host who is also an adviser to his administration, the president defended the Democrats who were disrespecting him on the campaign trail, including one who even refused to say that she voted for Obama over Mitt Romney, in 2012. Sharpton wondered how Obama felt about hustling to raise big money for candidates who won\u2019t even be seen with him. \u201cThe bottom line is, though, these are all folks who vote with me; they have supported my agenda in Congress,\u201d Obama said. \u201cSo this isn\u2019t about my feelings being hurt. These are folks who are strong allies and supporters of me. I tell them -- I said, \u2018You do what you need to do to win. I will be responsible for making sure that our voters turn out.\u2019\u201d Can you imagine a politician saying that? If you really did encourage your fellow Democrats to publicly scorn you but privately support you, why would you tell?\n\n\n\nThe answer is in the phrase \u201cmaking sure that our voters turn out.\u201d The president and his party are trying to reprise the 2012 election in 2014, but the atmosphere is wholly different. First, except in Georgia and a couple of other races, Democrats have not yet succeeded in suppressing turnout among Republicans and GOP-leaning independents. The focus in most of the races remains on Obama policies, and especially on the dominant issues of the past several weeks, that has been bad news. With Republicans mobilized and independents breaking against the majority party, a base-pumping drive is of marginal value. The president, evidently concerned that black voters and other parts of his 2012 coalition were sitting out the election in deference to his feelings, wanted it known that dissident Democrats had his permission to badmouth him.\n\n\n\nDEMS NOT TURNING UP TURN OUT?\n\nNYT: \u201cEarly voting is underway in Nevada, and the numbers look bad for Democrats. Republicans and Democrats have voted in nearly equal numbers in Clark County, home to Las Vegas, where Democrats have a 13-point registration advantage. Only 10,000 voters have turned out, compared with 17,000 who turned out on the first day of 2010. Nevada isn\u2019t alone. The early voting numbers, a possible indicator of overall turnout, also look bad for Democrats in Ohio\u2026 The big drop-offs highlight that, even in 2010, Democrats were mobilizing large numbers of voters who wouldn\u2019t have participated in a less competitive contest. Or put another way: There\u2019s nothing about new Democratic voters in Iowa that proves the Democrats are better at mobilizing voters in the battleground states than they were four years ago.\u201d\n\n\n\n[WaPo looks at how the GOP is stepping up its ground game in crucial battleground Senate contests.]\n\n\n\nSHAHEEN SHIFTS STANCE ON EBOLA BAN AHEAD OF DEBATE\n\nWaPo: \u201cSen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) said through a spokesman Monday that she is open to a temporary travel ban from countries fighting Ebola, the latest Democrat to recalibrate their position on the issue\u2026 more and more Democrats are warming up to the idea of a temporary travel ban to prevent the spread of Ebola in the United States, an idea some Republicans have been pushing for weeks. Last week, Sen. Kay Hagan (D-N.C.) and Georgia Democrat Michelle Nunn endorsed the idea after their Republican opponents came out in support of a travel ban.\u201d\n\n[Shaheen and Republican Scott Brown are slated to debate tonight in New Hampshire.]\n\n\n\nMaybe he\u2019s getting fitted for a hazmat suit - Fox News: \u201cAmerica\u2019s newly appointed Ebola \u2018czar\u2019 is not yet in the House \u2014 at least not the ones on Pennsylvania Avenue or Capitol Hill. Ron Klain, appointed last Friday by President Obama to direct the nation's response to the Ebola crisis, sent his regrets Monday to the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, which had invited him to testify this Friday, a committee aide told Fox News.\u201d But Politico reports today that Klain may have other things on his mind: He is said to be getting groomed as a new senior adviser to the president after John Podesta moves on to a full-time role on Planet Hillary.\n\n\n\n[The Hill: \u201cSen.

John Kasich (R) is pushing back on reports that he'd said Obamacare was here to stay, saying Monday night that he opposes the federal health-care law and believes it could be repealed and replaced under a Republican president and GOP-controlled Congress. \u2018I don't back Obamacare. I never have. I want it to be repealed,\u2019 he told The Washington Post in a telephone interview. Kasich added, \u2018If the House and the Senate [are Republican-controlled] and we have a Republican president, Obamacare will be repealed flat out. Flat out. And it will be replaced.\u2019 The Republican's remarks came after the Associated Press reported earlier Monday that the governor said he did not think the health-care law could be repealed. Kasich and his spokesman denied that the governor was referring to the Affordable Care Act. He was talking about Medicaid expansion, they said.\u201d\n\n\n\nWITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE\u2026\n\nRule, Britannia! On this day in 1805, Lord Horatio Nelson, Vice Admiral of the White and commander of the British fleet, took on combined French and Spanish forces off the coast of Spain\u2019s Cape Trafalgar. Nelson, his fleet the only obstacle standing in the way of French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte\u2019s desire to invade England, would give his life that day in a sea battle that is the stuff of legend. Eyewitness to History recounts: \u201cFrom his perch in the upper rigging of the Redoubtable, a French sharpshooter took aim at a prized target on the deck of the Victory, fired and sent a musket ball into Nelson\u2019s left shoulder\u2026Nelson was carried below decks while the battle raged on. He lived long enough to hear the news of the Redoubtable's surrender and of his fleet\u2019s victory after four and one-half hours of combat\u201d After the battle, Nelson\u2019s body was encased in a large casket called a leaguer which was then filled with brandy as a preservative for the trip home. The hero of Trafalgar was given a state funeral and laid to rest in the crypt at St. Paul\u2019s Cathedral in London. Lord Nelson\u2019s coffin was made from the timber of a French ship he defeated in battle.\n\n\n\nGot a TIP from the RIGHT or LEFT?

[New Hampshire Republican Senate candidate] Scott Brown is driving his pickup truck. And [Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.,] is on the attack against him. But it\u2019s not 2012.

Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., for airing advertisements in which she touts her record on veteran\u2019s reform. The conservative group\u2019s ad points to Shaheen\u2019s unwillingness to meet with the group, not being on the committee that wrote the reform legislation and refusing to co-sponsor key reforms until after the VA scandal broke. \u201cWe are trying to correct the record about things Sen. Jeanne Shaheen has been saying about how she has been leading the charge on veterans issues,\u201d says the group\u2019s CEO Pete Hegseth in a video. \u201cWhile Sen. Shaheen has been good on a lot of veterans issues, it\u2019s just not true that she led the fight for the recent reform that passed Congress.\u201d\n\n\n\n[Boston Herald: \u201cU.S. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen clings to a tenuous 3-point lead over GOP challenger Scott Brown but falls short of the magic 50 percent mark\u2026 an exclusive new Suffolk University-Boston Herald poll reveals.

Kay Hagan (D., N.C.) recommended a North Carolina judge to President Barack Obama for a seat in the U.S. District Court, the judge ruled in favor of a company partially owned by Hagan\u2019s husband. The senator\u2019s husband, Charles T. \u2018Chip\u2019 Hagan, was a managing member of Hydrodyne Industries LLC when it sued a regional water authority for drawing water out of a river that had one of its hydroelectric dams built on\u2026. Superior Court Judge Calvin E. Murphy ruled the case in favor of Hydrodyne \u2026 Murphy\u2019s ruling was made on Oct. 23, 2009, just nine days after Sen. Hagan sent his name to Obama to be nominated for a lifetime seat on the U.S. District Court for Western North Carolina. Hagan withdrew her recommendation to Obama after North Carolina\u2019s News and Record contacted her office about the apparent conflict of interest, telling the paper that she \u201cwas not aware that Judge Murphy was hearing a case in which my husband had an interest.\u201d\u201d\n\n\n\nBig spending to hold Hagan\u2019s seat - Washington Examiner: \u201cThis year\u2019s North Carolina Senate race is shaping up to be one of America\u2019s first $100 million Senate races. By the time Nov. 4 rolls around, money spent or committed to the race between Democratic U.S. Sen Kay Hagan and Republican Thom Tillis is supposed to top $103 million, according to analysis by the Charlotte Observer. Three-quarters of the money comes from both party and interest groups, while more than $22 million comes from groups that don\u2019t disclose their donors, known as \u2018dark money\u2019 groups. Hagan\u2019s campaign has spent $19.6 million, being backed by $35 million from outside groups. Tillis\u2019 campaign has spent only $6 million, but outside groups have sent more than $42 million his way.\u201d\n\n\n\nDSCC says Tillis would ban birth control - In their latest ad, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee rips Republican Thom Tillis for cutting funding to the nation\u2019s largest abortion provider, Planned Parenthood and his pro-life views.\n\n\n\nROMNEY TO RALLY FOR ROBERTS\n\nAP: \u201cFormer Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney plans to campaign for [Republican] Kansas Sen.

Throughout this cycle, in reports by Carl Cameron and Jim Angle, we have sought to show the spending advantage Democrats have held despite all of the talk about Charles and David Koch and the evils of money in politics from Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and even President Obama. Now, as Fox News producer Serafin Gomez reports, new FEC reports released last night reveal environmentalist billionaire Tom Steyer, the biggest Democratic supporter, gave $15 million to his SuperPAC last month, bringing his total to $46 million for the year, and a $55 million total to date. According to the NYT, that makes Steyer the largest super PAC donor, passing Republican Sheldon Adelson, who gave upwards of $49 million to PACs in 2012. Steyer and the Democracy Alliance \u2013 a collection of more than 180 Democratic outside groups \u2013 dwarf anything the Koch brothers have in the game this year. The Democrats\u2019 ability to hold on to the Senate seems increasingly unlikely. But if they do, it will be Steyer and his \u2018dark money\u2019 that made it happen.\u201d \u2013 Bret Baier.\n\n\n\nReince tops DWS - The Republican National Committee brought in more dough than the Democratic National Committee in the month of September. In September, the RNC has announced they brought in $13.5 million, compared to the DNC\u2019s roughly $10.2 million in total donations.\n\n\n\nDCCC wins the cash war - The Hill: \u201cThe National Republican Congressional Committee once again lagged its Democratic counterpart in monthly fundraising in September, bringing in $11 million. That's far below the $16.7 million the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee announced it raised Monday morning. The DCCC has now outraised the NRCC $163 million to $125 million for the election cycle.\u201d\n\n\n\nNO LABELS: MANCHIN IN AD THAT CALLS REPUBLICAN A \u2018PROSTITUTE\u2019\n\nCharleston [W.V.] Gazette: \u201c[West Virginia Democrat] Nick Casey\u2019s Congressional campaign will begin airing a new television ad Tuesday that features Sen.

He was even voted one the least effective legislators in Maryland,\u2019 the new advertisement begins\u2026 In the new television ad, Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., says, \u2018Alex Mooney is not one of us. Nick Casey is pro-life, pro-gun, pro-coal. He\u2019s a true West Virginian.\u201d\u2019\n\n\n\nNO HICKEN-SNOOP-ER ALLIANCE\n\nDaily Caller: \u201cRapper and marijuana aficionado Snoop Dogg is proving that politics makes strange bedfellows, endorsing an unaffiliated (but libertarian-leading) dark horse candidate for governor of Colorado.

The three recorded a remixed version of Snoop\u2019s \u2018The Trap\u2019 for Dunafon\u2019s campaign. Dunafon is the colorful head of the 4,000-person enclave in the heart of Denver, perhaps best known for leading a charge to save its iconic strip club, Shotgun Willies. He\u2019s also popular for repealing outdated laws, championing the Second Amendment and preaching individual responsibility.\u201d\n\n\n\nYOU GOTTA START SOMEWHERE\n\nTampa Bay Tribune: \u201cA 28-year-old man is accused of stealing flushing handles and pipes from public bathrooms in St. Petersburg.
