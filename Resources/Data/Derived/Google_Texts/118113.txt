Rush Limbaugh compared President Obama to Hitler on Monday.

He was discussing allegations that VA health centers in Phoenix covered up long delays in treatment, during which time 40 veterans died. Obama is "madder than hell" about the allegations, White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough told CBS News' "Face the Nation."

Limbaugh said that Obama's response was exactly what Hitler, Stalin, Lenin and Fidel Castro would say. "This is classic, this is exactly how stuff like this gets spun... in dictatorships, and in totalitarian states since time immemorial," the host claimed.

"For example," Limbaugh said, "if Lenin only knew all these people dying in Ukraine... if Stalin only knew.. if Hitler only knew — oh, gee, if he only knew! If Castro, if he finds out, oh, no!”

Limbaugh has compared Obama to Hitler several times in the past.
