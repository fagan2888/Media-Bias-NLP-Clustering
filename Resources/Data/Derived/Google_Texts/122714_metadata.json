With no health background whatsoever, what Hauck\u2019s task? Apparently to \u201cexecute new program concepts\u201d and \u201canalyze organizational requirements,\u201d according to another 24 year old former McCrory political staffer who, as communications director at DHHS, is also paid nearly $90,000 with no health care experience. Finally today NC Policy Watch\u2019s Sarah Ovaska reports that another \u201cmanagement consultant\u201d DHHS contracted with was paid $100,000 for six months of work.\n\nSo, what have we gotten for all this amazingly highly-compensated private sector talent at a government agency where the bulk of the budget goes to providing health and long-term nursing care to millions of our most vulnerable citizens? We have health care providers who aren\u2019t being paid. A plan to take NC\u2019s awarding winning Medicaid program Community Care and turn it over surprise, surprise, to private insurance company contractors.\n\nIt could almost be amusing. All these enormously highly paid \u201cmanagement professionals\u201d running around managing only to make worse the organization they are being paid so much of our tax money to reform. Governor McCrory is presiding over an agency where cronyism runs amok, but that\u2019s not the worst part of it. There are literally children going hungry because of these wealthy health care clowns. There are literally small family doctors who are worried about going out of business because of these wealthy health care clowns. There are highly respected thirty-year state public health professionals being summarily fired as they worry about the cuts going on to dental care as the health care clowns look on.\n\nThe health care clowns are rolling in money. Their kids aren\u2019t going hungry. Their elderly parents don\u2019t have to worry about going to a doctor. Their families get good dental care. It\u2019s only all \u201cthose people\u201d who have to suffer those indignities. The health care clowns have no accountability. Not one clown has been fired, demoted or otherwise reassigned because of the continuing debacles at DHHS. The health care clowns go home at night to their comfortable homes and their comfortable state paychecks and no doubt raise their voices indignantly that their faces and salaries are in the news. Then they come back the next day and execute a few more \u201cprogram concepts\u201d as people continue to suffer. It\u2019s past time \u2013 way past time \u2013 for the health care clowns to go.", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 71966175060}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://pulse.ncpolicywatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/cropped-logo_shadow-square-270x270.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3e63\"", "article_summary": "It\u2019s past time \u2013 way past time \u2013 for the health care clowns to go.\nThere are literally small family doctors who are worried about going out of business because of these wealthy health care clowns.\nThe health care clowns are rolling in money.\nThe health care clowns have no accountability.\nThere are literally children going hungry because of these wealthy health care clowns."}
