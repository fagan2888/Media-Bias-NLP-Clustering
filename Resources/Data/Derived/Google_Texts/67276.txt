Josh Williams shows off his 2005 Ferrari F360 at Cars and Coffee last Saturday in Mount Pleasant. He also owns two Corvettes and a Ford Bronco.

Josh Williams clutched a warm drink and shot the breeze with fellow car buffs a few feet from his red 2005 Ferrari F360, as the weekly Cars and Coffee cruise-in wound down Dec. 19.

Nearby were a 15-year-old BMW M5 and a turbocharged 2000 Chevrolet Corvette.

“I have a few different cars,” said Williams, noting he also owns a 1974 Ford Bronco and 1978 and 2003 Corvettes.

With such a variety of vintage vehicles, the car fan sometimes bases his motoring decision on the weather. “It’s a nice day, not raining, you know,” said Williams in choosing the Ferrari, which he accidentally dubbed an F430. “I’ve wanted the F430,” he acknowledged.

Williams joined a few dozen auto collectors at the weekly event 8-11 a.m. at Mount Pleasant Towne Centre shopping plaza.

The East Cooper cruise-in isn’t the sole Saturday morning car gathering in the Charleston area but it’s been among the most consistent, held almost without fail for more than four consecutive years in at least three locations along U.S. Highway 17 North and off Coleman Boulevard.

“I wake up early (anyway),” said Adam Beebe, who brought his BMW 540 and looked over cars with auto fan Will Boehland. Collectors can sip coffee and walk around checking out a diverse group of vehicles to see what’s “new and exciting,” Beebe said.

Attendees can “hang out (and) talk with folks,” Boehland added.

Last Saturday, BMWs, ’Vettes and Ford Mustangs — including a 1966 vintage coupe and a Shelby Cobra — were among the most populated brands at the cruise-in.

Wes Bird arrived with his pet husky Koda in tow in a high performance turn-of-the-21st-century Corvette churning out 700 horsepower at the wheels. He said the coupe was “among the fastest here.”

Even so, Bird said he plans further tinkering with the ‘Vette, which is his daily driver. “Absolutely,” he said. Bird wants to tweak the engine some more, and “go for 1,000 (hp).”
