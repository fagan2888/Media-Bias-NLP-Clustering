It's a very proud day to be Irish.\"\n\nNPR's Ari Shapiro, speaking with Weekend Edition Saturday host Scott Simon, says that although Ireland is a predominately Catholic country and many clergy urged a no vote, \"the Church has had a lot of scandals\" in recent years. Without a doubt, he says, the Church is \"one of the losers in this vote.\"\n\nThe head of the Iona Institute, which ran the No campaign in Ireland's vote to legalize same-sex marriage, has tweeted his congratulations to the yes campaign.\n\nHere's the tweet from Iona Director David Quinn:\n\nAri says that conservative areas that voted against legalizing divorce in the 1990s have come in with a Yes vote for same-sex marriage.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"category": "Politics", "description": "Updated at 2:25 p.m. ET Ireland has become the first-ever country to approve same-sex marriage by referendum, voting overwhelmingly to approve it despite", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://wnpr.org/post/ireland-votes-overwhelmingly-approve-same-sex-marriage", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/shared/npr/styles/medium/nprshared/201505/409012039.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Updated at 2:25 p.m. ET Ireland has become the first-ever country to approve same-sex marriage by referendum, voting overwhelmingly to approve it despite", "title": "Ireland Votes Overwhelmingly To Approve Same-Sex Marriage"}, "story_id": 408990099, "twitter": {"site": "@wnpr", "card": "summary", "creator": "@wnpr"}, "author": "L.
