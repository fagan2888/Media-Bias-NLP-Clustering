There will be more than a few "silver" linings in Obamacare's 2015 prices.

When customers start shopping for the most popular plans on health-care marketplaces next week, they'll be more likely than not to see only modest increases—or even cuts—in prices on the cheapest plans being offered by insurers, a new report said Thursday.

According to the Urban Institute, insurers that are scrambling to retain existing customers—and get new ones—are keeping a lid on prices of the least-expensive "silver plans."

Silver plans are as a rule the second least-expensive types of plans sold on the insurance exchanges, and cover about 70 percent of health benefits, on average.

"There's a good deal of competition out there, and it really is holding down rate increases," said report co-author Linda Blumberg, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute, which conducted the study with funding from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. "You really see the competitive dynamics at work here."

"It's a real positive for customers," she said.

Still, the report underscored a looming concern for Obamacare's open enrollment.
