I ask you for forgiveness,\u201d Francis said at the start of his weekly general audience on Saint Peter\u2019s Square.\n\n\u201cIt is inevitable that scandals happen, but \u2018woe to that man by whom the offence cometh!'\u201d he said, quoting a passage from the Bible.\n\nVatican expert Joshua McElwee writing in the National Catholic Reporter described it as an \u201cextraordinary step\u201d.\n\nThe 78-year-old pope has been presiding over a three-week global council of cardinals and bishops, where debates over the Church\u2019s teachings on the family have been overshadowed by tales of Machiavellian plots and betrayal.\n\nThe leak of a private letter from rebellious cardinals has revived a cloak-and-dagger atmosphere likened to the \u201cVatileaks\u201d scandal in 2012, when Pope Benedict XVI\u2019s butler revealed fierce infighting in the highest echelons of the Church and allegations of serious fraud in the running of the city.\n\n\u201cThere is growing concern at the Vatican over the multiplication of scandals and a return of the \u2018Vatileaks\u2019 syndrome,a climate of revelations, suspicion and rumours of a \u2018gay lobby\u2019 that helped convince Benedict XVI to resign in 2013,\u201d religious watcher John Thavis said on his blog following the pope\u2019s mea culpa.\n\nFrancis may hope that his wide-sweeping apology will shame schemers in the centuries-old institution.\n\n\u2013 Rumours, accusations, denials \u2013\n\nVatican analyst Massimo Franco wrote in the Corriere della Sera daily that it appeared there was a bid to \u201crecreate the climate of Vatileaks\u2026 an operation that\u2019s been planned for some time, and which aims at discrediting not the synod but the two years of the Argentinian pope\u201d.\n\nThe council was overshadowed from the start by the surprise declaration by a Polish priest employed as a senior official at the Vatican that he was a practising homosexual.\n\nKrzystof Charamsa was immediately fired but the coming out added fuel to a fire already raging between conservative and liberal wings of the Church over the divisive issue of its relationship to gay believers.\n\nAnd the Vatican rumour mill went into overdrive in August after a former Polish archbishop who would have been the first high-ranking Catholic Church official to go on trial for paedophilia was found dead.\n\nThe Vatican ordered a swift post-mortem and said Jozef Wesolowski, who had been charged with sexually abusing minors during his period as ambassador in the Dominican Republic, had died of heart problems.\n\nThe pontiff was also drawn into the murky world of Italian politics this month after pointedly denying Rome\u2019s mayor Ignazio Marino had been invited on a papal trip abroad.\n\nThe perceived put-down was seen by many to have contributed to Marino\u2019s forced resignation last week.\n\nSince his election in 2013, Francis has apologised on behalf of the Church to sex abuse survivors, for the persecution of protestants in northern Italy, and for complicity in the oppression of Latin Americans during the colonial wars.\n\nHis predecessor Benedict XVI was famously forced to say sorry to Muslims around the world after a speech in 2006 which sparked protests and violence in several countries.\n\nBut John Paul II made the most famous pleas for forgiveness, apologising for the Church\u2019s silence during the Holocaust, the Inquisition, the Crusades, the Church\u2019s involvement in the African slave trade and the persecution of Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei \u2014 imprisoned for insisting the earth orbited the sun.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://www.rawstory.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Pope-Francis-in-bolivia-800x430.jpg", "height": 430}, "title": "Pope Francis issues \u2018extraordinary\u2019 apology over scandals"}, "fb": {"app_id": 212555972273585}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=0.1, maximum-scale=10.0"}, "article_summary": "I ask you for forgiveness,\u201d Francis said at the start of his weekly general audience on Saint Peter\u2019s Square.\n\u201cI want, in the name of the Church, to ask forgiveness for the scandals which have recently hit Rome and the Vatican.\nPope Francis officiates a holy mass at the square of Christ the Redeemer in Santa Cruz, Bolivia on July 9, 2015 (AFP)Pope Francis on Wednesday offered a surprise public apology from the Catholic Church for a series of scandals which have shaken the city of Rome and the Vatican.\nFrancis may hope that his wide-sweeping apology will shame schemers in the centuries-old institution.\nVatican expert Joshua McElwee writing in the National Catholic Reporter described it as an \u201cextraordinary step\u201d."}
