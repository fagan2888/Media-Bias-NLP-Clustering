The business lost its front door but nothing else, police say.

A 14-year-old boy was arrested after breaking into at least one business Monday morning.

Police responded to a break-in at the DeHoney's Dry Cleaning at 15th and Harvard around 5 a.m. and found a broken door.

A K-9 unit found the suspect hiding inside in a closet. When he refused to leave the closet, the K-9 went in and got him, records show.

Police also found two guns inside. The suspect had one of them - a .25-caliber handgun - in his possession. They say they found a .380-caliber handgun in the closet with some other property.

The teen was treated for a dog bite on the scene and taken downtown for booking.

Officers say there was no loss to the business other than the broken door.
