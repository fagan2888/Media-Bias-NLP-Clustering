A structure fire in Brighton destroyed a neighborhood bar early Saturday morning.

At 3:37 a.m., Brighton Fire Rescue tweeted that firefighters were responding to a working structure fire at the Brighton Tavern at 245 South Main Street.

One firefighter was treated for injuries and released from the hospital, the department said at 7:30 a.m.

Authorities said they were responding defensively to the fire that was spotted by a passerby at 3:09 a.m, the Brighton Police Department said.

The bar had closed about 1:15 a.m., police said, and no one was inside at the time of the blaze.

“No injuries or reports of fire damage to other structures, but Brighton Tavern … is a total loss,” the police department said in a Facebook post.

Around 3:51 a.m., the fire rescue said that crews were still battling the blaze, and crews remained on scene at 7:45 a.m.

Photos provided by the department show thick plumes of smoke, raging flames and a charred exterior of the tavern.

The Brighton Tavern’s Facebook page posted that the establishment had a fire and is now closed.

“More to come. Keep us in your prayers,” the post said.

This is a developing story that will be updated as more information is available.
