Yet, as alternative acts were blooming around him in 1990s Chicago, he quickly realized he also didn\u2019t belong in the world of confessional music that emphasized emotion over technical songcraft. Rather than give up, Bird built property on this seeming no-man\u2019s land \u2014 a career based on his trademark violin, whistling and witty lyrics.\n\nWith those career hallmarks in place, Bird is setting out now on his new record, \u201cAre You Serious,\u201d to deliver a sound that is more consciously polished and produced. Along the way, he\u2019s finding that he has a bit more in common with the confessional cadre than he once thought \u2014 and that he\u2019s more worried about democracy and guns than ever before.\n\nThis is a very strange time to be an American and to consider what democracy means with the election progressing, and I wondered if you had found any understanding of that for yourself.\n\nI am searching for understanding. It\u2019s interesting; I was just looking at Salon last night, and there was an article that used the words I\u2019d been searching for about Donald Trump, using the word \u201cstrongman\u201d and \u201cauthoritarian,\u201d and that\u2019s what I\u2019d been thinking. Like, wow, this is maybe one of the greatest risks to our democracy we\u2019ve encountered. And that\u2019s all \u2014 who knows what\u2019s gonna happen? And I\u2019m hearing from my friends, \u201cOh, if he gets elected, I\u2019m leaving the country.\u201d I always have a problem with that one. Well, good for you. Save your own skin. Leave us all to deal with it. These are the things that are going through my mind.\n\nI read that you\u2019re donating profits from your concert ticket sales to enrich gun control, and I was wondering specifically what organizations you\u2019re working with and how they\u2019re going about their efforts.\n\nIt\u2019s Everytown For Gun Safety, which is \u2014 I\u2019m pretty impressed by them. They\u2019ve got a really sensible message, which is kind of a voice that\u2019s needed, \u2019cause everything\u2019s so super-polarized on the issue. They\u2019re trying really hard to speak to the gun owners out there and not coming out with any threats to take away their guns or anything. Which is always the way I think. That kind of sensible voice is not always very popular, or, some would say, not always very effective. I just gotta believe that common sense can prevail sometimes.\n\nSo we\u2019re doing these [donations] through the concerts and then we\u2019re working on a video based on my song called \u201cPulaski at Night,\u201d which is about Chicago. Not written specifically about gun violence, but, as is the case with a lot of my songs, could be taken in many different ways. We\u2019re hoping that some of the imagery \u2014 it\u2019s gonna be shot in Chicago \u2014 and we\u2019re working on some concepts that will hopefully draw attention to the issue.\n\nWhat do you think it will take to get us to a place where we have gun-related equilibrium? Or at least, we\u2019re not constantly having mass shootings?\n\nPersonally, I think it comes down to alienation and also kind of a warrior sensibility in our culture. It pervades a lot of aspects of American life, the need to project strength and control. Guns are very symbolic for Americans, I guess. \u2018Cause what are they, other than these things that shoot these projectiles? They\u2019re mechanical devices that throw something very fast through the air. I try to think of it in those terms. It\u2019s just this thing that does this thing; why is it such an obsession? And it comes down to symbolism and control. Security and strength, and all these things Americans seem to be pretty fixated on.\n\nI think that the mass shootings \u2014 most of them, I don\u2019t know the statistics \u2014 but school shootings, that comes down to an amplified version of what we all probably went through in junior high and high school. Just taken to the extreme. When I was in sixth grade, I went through all sorts of vengeance scenarios to get back at the kids who were beating the crap out of me every day. None of them involved guns. The availability of guns certainly is a part of that. But I think the root cause is more about alienation and some of our social structures and institutional education \u2014 it\u2019s just too easy for a kid to get lost. There\u2019s more and more of us on the planet every day; there\u2019s more and more molecules rubbing against others, creating more friction and more scrapes out there. So it\u2019s just reaching a fever pitch. But certainly it is epidemic, more in America than other places. We gotta look at the way we have our whole society structured, really.\n\nDid you go into making \u201cAre You Serious\u201d with any sort of goal or mission for yourself?\n\nThe previous couple of records were very scrappy by design. They were not very produced. I wanted them to be honest and just people in a room making music, and I wanted the sound to be natural, unproduced. This one, I wanted to embrace production for good rather than evil and really try to nail something. I wanted the process to be more rigorous than it\u2019s been in the past, and that involved reaching out to people and trusting more people around me. I really wanted to make a less whimsical, more visceral, grab-you-in-the-gut kind of record. I have all these grand schemes before I make a record. Usually, it\u2019s the antidote to whatever I\u2019d done before. But I think in \u2014 I don\u2019t know how many records, ten, thirteen, it\u2019s arguable \u2014I\u2019ve never gone for it like this.\n\nOn the single, \u201cLeft Handed Kisses,\u201d hearing you and Fiona Apple singing together seems like it unlocks things in both of you that I don\u2019t usually hear in your music. How did that collaboration come about? Was it just done in a couple takes or did it take longer?", "article_metadata": {"description": "Salon talks to the singer/songwriter about his new album, Chicago's '90s music scene, democracy and gun control", "title": "Andrew Bird gets confessional, at last: \u201cI really wanted to make a less whimsical, more visceral, grab-you-in-the-gut kind of record\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Salon talks to the singer/songwriter about his new album, Chicago's '90s music scene, democracy and gun control", "title": "Andrew Bird gets confessional, at last: \u201cI really wanted to make a less whimsical, more visceral, grab-you-in-the-gut kind of record\u201d", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/04/01/andrew_bird_gets_confessional_at_last_i_really_wanted_to_make_a_less_whimsical_more_visceral_grab_you_in_the_gut_kind_of_record/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/03/andrew_bird.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Salon talks to the singer/songwriter about his new album, Chicago's '90s music scene, democracy and gun control", "title": "Andrew Bird gets confessional, at last: \u201cI really wanted to make a less whimsical, more visceral, grab-you-in-the-gut kind of record\u201d", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/03/andrew_bird.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Erin Lyndal Martin", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Andrew Bird, Are You Serious, Gun Control, Music", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "I really wanted to make a less whimsical, more visceral, grab-you-in-the-gut kind of record.\nTopics: Andrew Bird, Are You Serious, Gun Control, Music, Entertainment NewsDespite going through conservatory and getting a degree in violin performance, Andrew Bird has always felt like an outsider in the world of classical music.\nI read that you\u2019re donating profits from your concert ticket sales to enrich gun control, and I was wondering specifically what organizations you\u2019re working with and how they\u2019re going about their efforts.\nThey\u2019ve got a really sensible message, which is kind of a voice that\u2019s needed, \u2019cause everything\u2019s so super-polarized on the issue.\nI wanted them to be honest and just people in a room making music, and I wanted the sound to be natural, unproduced."}
