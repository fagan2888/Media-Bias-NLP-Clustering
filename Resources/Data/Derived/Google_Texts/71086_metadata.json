Renee Ellmers speaks during a hearing on implementation of the Affordable Care Act before the House Energy and Commerce Committee Oct. 24, 2013 on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C. (Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images)\n\n4109747\n\nThe political risks to the GOP of immigration were highlighted in Cary, N.C., last week, when a PR. event hosted by GOP Rep. Renee Ellmers quickly descended into an extended complaint by business leaders about supposedly uneducated, untalented and unmotivated Americans.\n\nThe videotaped session was arranged by business leaders to applaud Ellmer\u2019s support for a proposed immigration rewrite that would increase the current annual inflow of 650,000 guest workers and 1 million immigrants into the overflowing U.S. labor pool.\n\nThroughout the Feb. 19 event, Ellmers tried to downplay the risks to American workers, and to the 4 million Americans who turn 18 each year, by using a series of poll-tested terms, including the \u201ccome out the shadows\u201d euphemism for a conditional amnesty.\n\nBut the business and government advocates for increased immigration quickly stripped down to the basics \u2014 they want to hire low-cost foreign workers, mostly in place of Americans.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s just not a lot of folks \u2026 that are willing to go back and do jobs that need to be done,\u201d said Scott Schaberg, the director of company relations for the Golden Corral restaurant chain.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just going to go ahead and say it \u2014 Americans won\u2019t do that work, and for what [employers] can get those other [immigrant] folks to do it,\u201d said Dana Cope, who heads an advocacy group for government employees, the State Employees Association of North Carolina. The extra workers are needed to generate more taxes for government agencies, said Cope, who also was a vice president in 2012 at the Service Employees International Union, which is a leading advocate for amnesty and for extra guest workers.\n\nThe meeting gave lots of ammunition to her primary opponent, Frank Roche, who is running radio ads that highlight his opposition to amnesty.\n\n\u201cRep. Ellmers voluntarily doubled down on her immigration position\u2026 more amnesty, more legal immigration, more unsecured borders, more multiculturalism,\u201d Roche said in statement. \u201cIt is clear unemployed and economically challenged citizens are not excited about her position.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need and want immigration for the United States \u2014 [but] we need much lower levels,\u201d said Roche, a Massachusetts-born, former international banker in New York, who is working to win support from both voters and CEOs.\n\n\u201cThere is a chance [immigration] could screw her in the primary,\u201d said Ron Woodard, a former sales executive an an international high-tech firm, who runs a state-wide immigration reform group, NC Listen, which opposes illegal immigration. \u201cThe more she talks about this, the more people hear about it.\u201d\n\nDuring the event, Ellmers sought business leaders\u2019 support for her advocacy for an multi-stage legalization, also called an amnesty, for at least 11 million illegals, and for an increased inflow of guest-workers.

Ellmers backs conditional amnesty, fuels primary challenge)\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is not practical, it is not comment sense to assume that 11 or 12 or 20 million people are simply going to pick up and leave our country\u2026. they are living in the shadows [and] that is a big problem,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWe know that we need the workforce, but there is that idea out there that if we promote this, that we will take American jobs,\u201d she said. \u201cI would love to be able to clarify, that those of you in industry would [not] choose to hire someone who is here illegally or someone [on a work-visa]\u2026 because you can pay them less than what the standard wage would be,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIt is very important that we make the point why immigration reform is very important to [business leaders], and why it should be to all of us,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThere are myths, there\u2019s misunderstanding, there\u2019s stereotypes, and unfortunately, many [beliefs] that resulted in bigotry,\u201d she said.\n\nSo far, the amnesty bill has been blocked by House GOP leaders because of protests from the public.\n\nThe \u201dimmigrant workforce makes up about 22 percent for both residential and commercial construction,\u201d said Lisa Martin, the chief lobbyist with the North Carolina Homebuilders Association. \u201cWe, at both the national level and the state level, we do support legal immigration,\u201d she added.\n\nConstructions worker are paid roughly $29,000 a year in North Carolina, according a website that tracks salaries.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t find local workers, and the H-2B [guest-worker] visa program does not work\u2026 there are too few [H-2B visas] and there are too many administrative hurdles to make that work for our industry,\u201d complained Cindy Crew, a Maryland-based saleswoman with Marriott International.\n\nRoom-cleaners and front-desk attendants in North Carolina are paid only $20,000 or less, per year, according to data at the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nAgriculture companies need \u201cworkers that can just do the picking of tomatoes for 10 hours a day,\u201d said Faylene Whitaker, an owner of a garden center and farm that uses machinery to pick 70 percent of its tomato crop. \u201cWe just can\u2019t find local workers\u2026 Every aspect of farming in North Carolina depends on foreign workers,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI have no clue\u201d what wage would persuade Americans to take the tomato-picking jobs, she told The Daily Caller last month.\n\nOne in seven of North Carolina\u2019s workforce is either unemployed, or working part-time because they can\u2019t find a full-time job, according to the BLS.\n\nHigh-tech companies also asked for more foreign workers, though thousands of skilled American professionals are eager to take jobs in the state.\n\n\u201cOur concern is that if we don\u2019t have the talent to help us in research and development and if we don\u2019t have access to global talent, we may be forced to go elsewhere,\u201d threatened Vanessa Beltre, a recruitment manager with a Caterpillar Inc. factory in Ellmers\u2019 district, in Clayton, NC.\n\n\u201cWe have Caterpillar employees from China, India, that are waiting up to 10 years\u201d for residency permits, she complained.\n\nCommercial databases show that Caterpillar has asked the federal government for approval to bring in 728 foreign professionals since 2011.\n\nCisco Systems can\u2019t get the \u201cvisas [for guest-workers] that we need to be able to fulfill the opportunities that we have,\u201d said Ed Paradise, the vice-president for engineering with Cisco\u2019s facility in the nearby Research Triangle Park. The company makes Internet communications nodes, and has asked the federal company for visas to bring in 1,425 foreign professional-level guest workers since 2011. The company has also sought green cards for 1,214 foreign professionals since 2011.\n\nA widely used online job-search site for American engineers shows that 12,233 engineers are seeking work in North Carolina or \u201canywhere in the U.S.\u201d\n\nThe local university, North Carolina State, is also seeking to hire foreigners. From 2011 to 2013, it applied for 342 guest worker visas, while promising to pay salaries around $52,000 to the guest workers.\n\nCope, the progressive advocate for state government employees, also pushed for greater reliance on foreign workers. \u201cWe need to have a workforce, a workable guest [visa] program,\u201d he said.\n\nGovernment employees want \u201ca reasonable path for law-abiding and tax-paying, hard-working undocumented immigrants already in the United States to earn legal status,\u201d he added. Legal status is usually a precursor to full citizenship.\n\nThe employers\u2019 dismissal of U.S. workers is offensive, Jan Ting, a former immigration official in President George H. W. Bush\u2019s administration, told The Daily Caller.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any job that is too difficult, hard or dirty to do \u2014 they just want to be paid a decent wage,\u201d Ting, the American-born son of a Chinese-born surgeon who served in the 1944 Battle of the Bulge against the 6th S.S. Panzer Army.\n\n\u201cAs a nation, we want American employers to give preferred hiring to American workers\u2026 we can\u2019t just write them off, which is what the employers are willing to do,\u201d Jan TIng, who is now a law professor at Temple University in Philadelphia, Pa.\n\nOne of the business speakers at the event, however, later talked to TheDC at length about the measures he\u2019s taken to find and train American workers since the federal government reduced his supply of H-2B guest-workers to roughly 40 per year\n\nFew Americans want to work in his low-status and arduous landscaping sector, and his clients won\u2019t pay enough to let him raise base salaries above $10.00 per hour, said Kurt Bland, co-owner of Bland Landscaping.\n\nSo he\u2019s tried hard to recruit poor and disadvantaged Americans, including former convicts and people with drunk-driving convictions. He\u2019s also opened a new facility at a bus-stop in a blighted African-American neighborhood so he can recruit marginal workers and people who don\u2019t own cars.\n\nHe keeps his existing 200 workers by upping their skills, providing some health-care and a 401K savings plan.\n\nHe\u2019s also considering buying robot lawn mowers that will help his employees raise their productivity, he said.\n\nBut he\u2019s facing draining competition from fly-by-night companies that can safely hire low-wage illegals instead of Americans because state and federal officials don\u2019t check hiring practices of companies with fewer than 25 employees.\n\nSome of his rival companies haven\u2019t even registered to use the federal E-Verify system (EV) that allows employers to reject job requests from illegal immigrants, he said.\n\n\u201cI have competitors, landscapers I deal with every day, who by law should be using EV, but they\u2019re not,\u201d he said. \u201cNobody is enforcing [the immigration law]\u2026 nobody is cracking on them, not at all\u2026 [and] all of a sudden there are landscape companies popping up all over the place with between 1 and 24 employees,\u201d Bland said.\n\n\u201cAll I\u2019m asking for is a level playing field [where] all of us use EV or none of us\u2026 [because] right now the playing field is tilted sharply in favor of companies with less than 25 employees,\u201d he said.\n\nWoodard sympathized with Bland. \u201cOnce competitors hire illegal labor, other companies are pressured to do it to stay competitive\u2026 [and] when business executives want to play by the rules, they\u2019re at a serious disadvantage.\u201d\n\nBut if the government enforced immigration laws, American employers and American employees would rise together, he said.\n\nEllmers\u2019 office declined to answer questions from TheDC.\n\nTamar Jacoby, the president of ImmigrationWorks USA, which organized the Feb. 19 event, also declined to talk to TheDC.\n\nHowever, Jacoby told an interviewer Feb. 20 that the meeting was a \u201cgreat event.\u201d\n\n\u201cRepublicans listen to the small business owners in their district,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cPeople in communities listen to the small business owners who they know and trust, who say \u2018You know, if you want your Christmas trees, at my nursery we can\u2019t grow them unless I have some extra workers to help me.\u2019 That\u2019s a way to explain to people in communities, voters, why we need immigration reform,\u201d she said.\n\nEllmers is a great messenger, Jacoby said, because she is \u201cvery appealing, young, she was formerly a nurse\u2026 she\u2019s from that young radical conservative congressional generation, but she\u2019s smart about immigration.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s out front with Speaker [of the House John] Boehner and with leadership arguing that Republicans need to do immigration reform,\u201d Jacoby added.\n\nWoodard demurred. Ellmers, he said, \u201ccomes across to me as more concerned about helping illegals keep their jobs, rather than helping her constituents find jobs.\u201d\n\nFollow Neil on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Neil Munro", "description": "Not a surprise; CEOs favor their companies, not GOP politicians' careers", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "The political risks to the GOP of immigration were highlighted in Cary, N.C., last week, when a PR. event hosted \u00a0by GOP Rep.
