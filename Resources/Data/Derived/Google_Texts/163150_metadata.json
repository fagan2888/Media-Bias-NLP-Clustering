Mr. Cook noted that it is quite common for re-elected presidents to witness precipitous drops in their approval ratings in Round 2, and that President Obama has been no exception.\n\nMr. Cook pinned the president\u2019s popularity woes on lingering economic problems, distaste for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, and the scandals that have dogged the Obama administration. He declared it is not impossible, but unlikely Mr. Obama will be able to stage a comeback.\n\nRead about it all here.\n\nI think Mr. Cook\u2019s intuition is right on the money. If something happens to erode confidence in a president early in his second term, the lame-duck nature of Round 2 makes it difficult to climb out of the hole. In Mr. Obama\u2019s case, not long after he was re-elected in 2012, many Americans came to see his administration as an incompetent group of political tricksters, because of the aforementioned debacles. Given that the resulting approval-ratings slump hasn\u2019t reversed itself, it seems this narrative is set in stone.\n\nSince Mr. Obama\u2019s political capital diminishes by the day, it seems there is little he can do to change \u2013 no pun intended \u2013 things. Indeed, his second-term situation is analogous to that of his predecessor, George W. Bush.\n\nAs Mr. Cook pointed out, a major economic upsurge or a \u201crally around the flag\u201d event could help the president, but it sure seems he faces steep odds.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "He declared it is not impossible, but unlikely Mr. Obama will be able to stage a comeback.\nMr. Cook noted that it is quite common for re-elected presidents to witness precipitous drops in their approval ratings in Round 2, and that President Obama has been no exception.\nSince Mr. Obama\u2019s political capital diminishes by the day, it seems there is little he can do to change \u2013 no pun intended \u2013 things.\nMr. Cook pinned the president\u2019s popularity woes on lingering economic problems, distaste for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, and the scandals that have dogged the Obama administration.\nAs Mr. Cook pointed out, a major economic upsurge or a \u201crally around the flag\u201d event could help the president, but it sure seems he faces steep odds."}
