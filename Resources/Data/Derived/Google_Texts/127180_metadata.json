For instance, the county has the 10th highest rate of opioid poisoning deaths in the state. Despite prescription drug abuse being declared an epidemic by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2011, Sacramento hasn't created a task force to address the problem, which is one of the recommendations of the DHHS report.\n\nThe county has developed a continuum of care with inter-agency collaboration and multiple points of entry for the substance abuse population, but a rising need has formed a bottleneck. The report cited a 36-percent rise in demand for detox and residential facilities, which has created longer lists and wait-times.\n\nMedi-Cal currently doesn\u2019t cover detox or residential treatment, but California is expected to address that through a waiver program available to counties. Opting into the program would mean more administrative work for the county, as it would have to ensure local facilities meet certain requirements set by the state. But the alternative is unsustainable, says the report: \u201cThe service capacity is not currently able to meet the community need.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"Rating": "General", "description": "By Jason Smith.
