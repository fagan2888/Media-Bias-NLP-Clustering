That may be the question for workers of one Corpus Christi Outreach Program.\n\n\"We wouldn't be able to afford all the other residents that opportunity...\" sates worker Beau Gest Ahnee\n\nHe started out like many others in need. When he came to the Good Samaritan Rescue Mission, they helped provide him with work, but now others may soon not have that option.\n\nProgram Director Rafael Ortiz says \"Now, we are having to get insurance on every single person we send out. Instead of losing maybe losing a dollar or two an hour when we send someone out, it's gone up drastically because of it\"\n\nNow that the Good Samaritan has taken on more than fifty workers, they fall under the Affordable Care Act. For a non-profit agency that means money out of their pocket. Now, they must focus on keeping their workers employed so they can fast track them to a full time job that will provide them insurance and keep the GSRM from having to do so.\n\n\"We are trying to get more clients to hire homeless people to do temp work and so forth\" continues Ortiz.\n\nIt could cost anywhere between two dollars a day to possibly hundreds more per worker, depending on what provider they can get. In a worst case scenario, it means people like Beau may not have the chance to even find work... only because they can not afford insurance.\n\nSo far, the good Samaritan is hoping to find the cheapest possible option for an insurance provider. They won't find out what provider they can get until the first of February.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "When you think of the affordable care act, the first thing to come to mind may not be \"How do I even pay for this?\".
