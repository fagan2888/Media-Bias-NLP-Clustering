There is a reason why these two conditions seem to go together so easily.\n\nMedical research suggests young children and infants who do not get enough sleep are likely to develop obesity \u2014 and a host of devastating related health conditions \u2014 before they enter their teen years.\n\nAnd by then, reversing the obesity is almost impossible, health experts say.\n\nA study published in May in the journal Pediatrics hypothesizes that children sleeping less in early childhood developed obesity by age 7.\n\nBut the findings from researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital for Children are hardly shocking, say local physicians.\n\nThe study's other conclusion confirms what doctors already know: that obese children who suffer from obstructive sleep apnea also experience a variety of health issues, according to Dr. Ignacio Tapia, a pediatric pulmonologist and sleep medicine specialist at the Sleep Center at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.\n\nTapia said that youngsters of normal weight who experience deep sleep and REM (rapid eye movement) sleep find sleep restorative, benefitting everything from brain activity to hormone secretions.\n\nBut the obese often cannot attain deep sleep because of the apnea, a condition characterized by brief, numerous involuntary breathing pauses that prevent people from reaching restorative levels of slumber.\n\nSleep \u2014 and the ways genetic research, digital technology and a new generation of mattresses are coming to the rescue \u2014 is the theme of Sleep-Con 2014. The special event, presented by P.C. Richard & Son and the Asbury Park Press, will be held from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m., Aug. 2 at the Monmouth University Multipurpose Activity Center.\n\nSleep-Con 2014 will feature sleep experts and sleep technology, plus entertainment and activities for the whole family.\n\nAdmission is $10 the day of the event and $5 in advance.

Researchers find that sleep deficiencies in children can be misdiagnosed as attention-deficit or behavior disorders.\n\nYoung patients with sleep apnea can be treated effectively with surgery to remove their tonsils and adnoids but for obese children, such a procedure may not resolve the issue. Further treatment can involve wearing cumbersome masks that help regulate breathing.\n\n\"Remember when your grandparents told you you need to go to sleep to grow?\" Tapia asked. \"Well, that turned out to be true. Growth is associated with longer sleep. The people who sleep less (for example) may have less insulin secretion, which can be related to diabetes and pre-diabetes.\"\n\nSince the 1800s, each generation has lived longer than the one that preceded it, said Tapia.\n\nNow, this generation might be the one that loses ground because of the epidemic of obesity, which is a complex issue relating to social and cultural issues as well as income, physicians say. Those who earn less might not have ready access to healthy foods, while eating at fast-food chains has been made increasingly affordable, Tapia said. Portion size also is an issue in this country.\n\n\"We are seeing patients who are not a little big but really, really big,\" he said. \"It is not rare to see patients who have doubled their ideal weight. They do not weigh 20 or 30 percent more but 100 percent more'' than growth charts indicate.\n\nObesity \"definitely spans all ages,\" said Dr. Tina Rakitt, a pediatric gastroenterologist at the Unterberg Children's Hospital at Monmouth Medical Center in Long Branch. But the study published in May \"is unique enough to say the obesity and sleep link even exists in young children,\" she added. \"There are many reasons for that link. People who don't sleep well tend to eat more and they tend to eat more of the wrong things.\"\n\nThe battle is lost once children are old enough to select their own snacks or meals, unless they are taught correctly. Physicians say healthy eating must be established when children are infants and must be carried on by the family. Obesity does not exist in a vacuum, the experts say.\n\n\"The obesity epidemic is not only an adult problem; it is a adult-pediatric problem,\" Rakitt said. \"We are seeing more sleep apnea\u2026That is a terrible one. Children are developing fatty liver disease. We are starting to see some kids with serious complications either in their childhood or young adult years.\"\n\nAs the obesity epidemic increases among the young, so do possible treatments. Bariatric surgery for teens and adolescents is gaining momentum, Tapia said, although CHOP is not performing such procedures, preferring educational and lifestyle programs to surgery. Bariatric surgery can be performed only when children stop growing in their later teens, he said.\n\n\"Childhood obesity is literally doubling in the last few decades,\" agreed Nader Nakhleh, pediatric pulmonologist with K. Hovnanian Children's Hospital in Neptune. \"There is a link \u2014 a well established link \u2014 between sleep apnea and obesity. It is well established in adults but now it is in children\" as well.\n\nIt is not easy to make the changes that could reverse childhood obesity. Mealtimes should be standardized, as should bedtimes. Children should not be consuming food or sugary beverages for at least two hours before bedtime and electronics \u2014 particularly those with blue-light effects that simulate daylight \u2014 should be shut down earlier, experts suggest. The process of bedtime should begin 45 minutes before lights out, to allow a winding-down period. Children can enjoy a bedtime story.\n\nHow much sleep is enough?\n\n\u2022 1- to 3-year-olds need 12 to 14 hours of sleep in a 24-hour period.\n\n\u2022 3- to 5-year-olds need 11 to 13 hours of sleep each night and most do not nap after age 5.\n\n\u2022 Adults need about eight hours of sleep every night.\n\nSource: National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute\n\nRead or Share this story: http://on.app.com/1mioz2Q", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Studies show obesity may develop in young children who do not get enough or quality sleep", "og": {"site_name": "Asbury Park Press", "description": "Studies show obesity may develop in young children who do not get enough or quality sleep", "title": "Sleep-deprived children more likely to be obese", "url": "http://www.app.com/story/news/health/sleep/2014/07/16/childhood-obesity-sleep/12755733/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/app.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Studies show obesity may develop in young children who do not get enough or quality sleep", "title": "Sleep-deprived children more likely to be obese", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/fa04d8bafeef1f66507a14ff99871af91cdea889/c=324-0-1620-1296&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/AsburyPark/2014/07/16/childsleepstudy2.jpg", "creator": "@AsburyParkPress", "site": "@AsburyParkPress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600068887", "fb": {"app_id": 116172675120111}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "article_summary": "But the study published in May \"is unique enough to say the obesity and sleep link even exists in young children,\" she added.\nPhysicians say infants and children who have sufficient sleep are less likely to develop obesity as juveniles and thus may be spared the condition as adults.\nWhen children do not get the sleep they need, they are at risk for health, performance and difficulties in school.\nMedical research suggests young children and infants who do not get enough sleep are likely to develop obesity \u2014 and a host of devastating related health conditions \u2014 before they enter their teen years.\nBut the findings from researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital for Children are hardly shocking, say local physicians."}
