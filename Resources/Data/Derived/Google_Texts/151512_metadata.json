But since health care has been such a dominating issue for Obama, former administration officials are expecting to hear about it tonight. Obama\u2019s final State of the Union address may include his long-term dreams for health care, such as Medicaid expansion, controlling health care costs and addressing drug prices, Pro\u2019s Nancy Cook reports. The president may also touch on the link between mental health and access to guns. Your trusty health team will give you the rundown tomorrow morning. In the meantime, more from Nancy here: http://politico.pro/1N2V95M.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nKENTUCKY PREPARES TO DISKYNECT \u2014 As expected, Republican Gov. Matt Bevin has officially notified HHS that he is dismantling Kentucky's state-based exchange, Pro\u2019s Rachana Pradhan reports. He sent notice on Dec. 30 (but wasn't made public until Monday) \u2014 and it's possible the transition could be completed in time for the 2017 enrollment period. The feds said they'll work with the state to wind down operations, which will cost Kentucky around $23 million \u2014 that's according to estimates from former Democratic Gov. Steve Beshear's administration.\n\n\u2014 In other Kentucky news, state insurance commissioner Sharon Clark will step down, SNL Financial reports.\n\nWELCOME TO TUESDAY MORNING, where the State of PULSE is about to get even stronger as Erin and I prepare to pass off the baton to the newest addition to our team, Dan Diamond, who will take over your favorite morning health policy tipsheet tomorrow!

Acting CMS Administrator Andy Slavitt indicated Monday evening that the administration will eliminate some of the reasons that it allows customers to sign up for coverage outside of the standard enrollment window. In addition, Slavitt said that CMS will be tightening the marketplace rules to make sure customers aren\u2019t gaming the system, and it will terminate coverage for individuals who improperly signed up for plans through a special enrollment period. \"There are some [special enrollment periods] that we need to clarify because they\u2019re subject frankly to abuse,\u201d Slavitt said during a speech at the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco. \u201cThere may be bad actors and others out there who are abusing those [special enrollment periods].\" More from Paul: http://politico.pro/1ZXzzco\n\nSCOOPLET: FISHER LEAVES HILL FOR DOWNTOWN \u2014 Karen Fisher, a long-time senior health adviser on the Senate Finance Committee, is leaving Capitol Hill, she told contacts in an email Monday. The Democratic staffer, who played a key role in crafting the new Medicare payment formula, will be the chief policy officer at the Association of American Medical Colleges. She's returning to the organization after serving as its senior policy counsel before coming to the Hill.\n\nTODAY: HELP VOTES ON FDA NOMINEE \u2014 The Senate HELP Committee votes on Robert Califf's nomination to lead the FDA this morning. Califf largely breezed through his confirmation hearing in November and has the support of committee leadership.\n\nGOP\u2019S UPCOMING 'FAMILY DISCUSSION' ON OBAMACARE REPLACEMENT \u2014 Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady said that Republicans will have a \"family discussion\" on an Obamacare replacement plan at their retreat this week. He said it won't be a top-down plan led by committee chairs. \"It will be collaboration of 246 members,\" Brady said Monday at POLITICO's Morning Money discussion. He said that he envisions a \"health care backpack\" plan - an array of options for workers who can take a plan from \"job to job and state to state\" and potentially into retirement.\n\n** A message from PhRMA: Coverage does not necessarily mean access to care.

The task force advises that women between the ages of 50 to 75 get biannual mammogram screenings, while women ages 40 to 49 should weigh the benefits and harms of screening every two years. The panel noted that while \"screening mammography is effective in reducing deaths from breast cancer for women in their 40s, the likelihood of benefit is less than for older women and the potential harms proportionally greater,\" adding that the most serious potential harm is unneeded treatment.\n\n\u2014 The USPSTF recommendations are gaining traction in some medical circles, but they are still opposed by many lawmakers who in the latest budget deal included language keeping existing screening recommendations in place for at least two years. That effectively makes these recommendations moot until 2018. My story here.\n\nHEALTH INDUSTRY HAS ITS OWN CANCER MOONSHOT \u2014 A coalition of pharma, biotech, health insurers, academic centers and community oncologists, along with Bank of America, launched a coalition to accelerate the use of combination cancer immunotherapies. Dubbed the National Immunotherapy Coalition, the group is launching their Cancer Moonshot 2020 Program, which aims to complete clinical trials in as many as 20,000 cancer patients at all stages of disease for up to 20 different tumor types by 2020. The drug companies will make available more than 60 novel cancer drugs as part of the project. Independence Blue Cross will provide insurance coverage of whole genome sequencing for trial patients. Immunotherapy treatments are designed to harness the body\u2019s own immune system to fight off cancer. The group already met with Vice President Joe Biden in December after he had called for a \"moonshot\" to end cancer.

But there was some news for CMS to celebrate, too: the agency added 100 new shared savings ACOs, and quite a few participants chose to take on substantial risk: 22 ACOs are in Tracks 2 or 3 of the shared savings program, and 12 are in the End-Stage Renal Disease track. CMS deputy administrator Sean Cavanaugh told PULSE that some dropouts make sense. \"This is a new model of care,\" he said. While some were ready to transition to risk, some weren't. \"They're all figuring out what the right level of risk is,\" he said. \"That's why we offer a number of models.\"\n\n\u2014 There are 21 participants in the new Next Generation ACO program, which was developed to attract more experienced providers. That program signed up several former Pioneers, including ThedaCare, Deaconess, Park Nicollete and OSF Healthcare System. The full list is here: http://1.usa.gov/1RHstWr\n\n\u2014 Still, that list of Next Gen participants is missing some of the bigger names in health care (like Atrius or Sharp). While CMS signed up frustrated Pioneer participant Beacon Health, it didn't nab Dartmouth-Hitchcock \u2014 which dropped out of the Pioneer program last fall while pledging to take a good hard look at NextGen. Executive vice president Rob Greene told PULSE the financial targets still would have had them losing millions. Greene said the program is still aimed at providers who have a lot of waste in their systems, and at Dartmouth-Hitchcock, there just \"isn't that much fat for us to cut out.\"\n\nANOTHER TWO-MIDNIGHTS LAWSUIT \u2014 Fifty more hospitals are joining the fight against the payment reduction associated with CMS's two midnights rule, Modern Healthcare reports. (Remember, CMS drastically modified how the rule is enforced last year, but didn't end the 0.2 percent payment reduction that went with it.) This is the fourth such lawsuit.

Cornyn is pushing his reform measure that is expected to get a hearing in the Senate Judiciary Committee as early as this month. The NRA-backed bill faces pushback from Democrats who say it weakens restrictions on gun purchases. As POLITICO reported earlier, Cornyn is hoping to eventually couple his measure with a larger mental health overhaul bill still awaiting a markup in the HELP Committee.\n\n\u2014 Speaking of SOTU, here's POLITICO's scorecard on how policy proposals mentioned in Obama's previous SOTU addresses have fared: http://politico.pro/1PTpg4p\n\nIMPORTANT BIRTHDAY UPDATE: We\u2019d like to wish an extremely happy birthday to our ace pharma reporter, Sarah Karlin, who will be celebrating by covering the Califf hearing this morning!

That means a long trip or higher copays to stick with the pharmacies that patients like. In urban areas, these plans often fail to meet the government\u2019s standard for pharmacy access. In rural areas, \u201cpreferred\u201d pharmacies are often 20+ miles away! Support H.R. 793 / S. 1190. This bipartisan legislation is supported by leading consumer advocates and would let patients use any pharmacy willing to accept the \u201cpreferred\u201d pharmacy terms and conditions.
