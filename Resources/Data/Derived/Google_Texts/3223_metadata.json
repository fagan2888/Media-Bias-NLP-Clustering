Dianne Feinstein of California who slammed the sheriff\u2019s policy as a catalyst to Steinle\u2019s death.\n\n\u201cThese murders could have been prevented if there were open channels of communication between local law enforcement and federal immigration authorities about dangerous individuals,\u201d Feinstein said Tuesday.\n\n\u201cA simple phone call would have been enough, but Sheriff Mirkarimi failed to notify federal officials.\u201d\n\nHer comments arrived just before Senate Democrats blocked a bill that would have stripped funding from sanctuary jurisdictions that refuse to comply with federal immigration law.\n\nSan Francisco Supervisor John Avalos called Feinstein\u2019s criticism \u201cabsolutely wrong,\u201d adding that lawmakers have attempted to politicize Steinle\u2019s death \u201cto score political points.\u201d\n\nHe said Lopez-Sanchez had no intent \u201cto harm anyone,\u201d citing evidence that found the bullet ricocheted off of pavement prior to striking Steinle. Investigators said the evidence aligned with Lopez-Sanchez\u2019s statement that he found the gun near the pier and accidentally fired the weapon after picking it up.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no causal relationship between our sanctuary city policies and the death that occurred on Pier 14 in San Francisco,\u201d Avalos said. \u201cThere\u2019s just a series of coincidences that happened that people add up to saying that there was a causal relationship between our sanctuary city policies and Kate Steinle\u2019s death and nothing is further from the truth.\u201d\n\nHe defended the policies for providing a \u201csafe place\u201d for illegal immigrants, adding that when immigrants mistrust law enforcement, \u201cit makes public safety efforts very, very challenging.\u201d\n\nHans von Spakovsky, a senior legal fellow at The Heritage Foundation, called San Francisco\u2019s decision to retain its status as a sanctuary city \u201coutrageous.\u201d\n\n\u201cSan Francisco\u2019s reckless decision to retain its sanctuary policy guarantees that more residents of the city will continue to be murdered, raped, assaulted and robbed in crimes that could have been prevented,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "They passed a resolution upholding the sanctuary city policies.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "They passed a resolution upholding the sanctuary city policies.", "title": "San Francisco Upholds Sanctuary Policies Despite Steinle Murder", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151021_SFSanctuary_Johnson.jpg", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1RWBKIJ"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "They passed a resolution upholding the sanctuary city policies.", "title": "San Francisco Upholds Sanctuary Policies Despite Steinle Murder", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151021_SFSanctuary_Johnson.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "immigration", "published_time": "2015-10-21T18:14:32+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "sanctuary city, Kate Steinle, San Francisco, Dianne Feinstein, Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThere\u2019s no causal relationship between our sanctuary city policies and the death that occurred on Pier 14 in San Francisco,\u201d Avalos said.\nSan Francisco officials declared Tuesday that the city\u2019s sanctuary policies would remain intact, shutting down critics who blamed the protections for enabling the high profile murder of Kathryn Steinle by an illegal immigrant in July.\nThe incident ignited sharp criticism of San Francisco Sheriff Ross Mirkarimi for implementing a policy that bars his deputies from notifying federal immigration officials of such releases.\n\u201cThese murders could have been prevented if there were open channels of communication between local law enforcement and federal immigration authorities about dangerous individuals,\u201d Feinstein said Tuesday.\nThe resolution upholds the city\u2019s status as a sanctuary jurisdiction despite the policies coming under national scrutiny after seven-time convicted felon Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, who was previously deported to Mexico five times, was released from local custody and later charged with fatally shooting Steinle on a San Francisco pier."}
