On Monday, President Obama made it clear that he thinks it was wrong for the U.S. Supreme Court to agree to hear the King v. Burwell case.

He spoke at a news conference at the Group of Seven (G-7) summit of leading industrial nations in Germany, and this was one of the first times he has openly discussed his feelings about the case.

“This should be an easy case, frankly it shouldn’t have even been taken up.”

Although a win for the plaintiffs would cause a lot of new challenges concerning the healthcare law, Obama insists that it is “well documented” that the authors of the Affordable Care Act didn’t intend to block people on federal exchanges from obtaining the subsidies, The Hill reported.

He also said people should “assume” that the law will be upheld and that “Congress could fix this whole thing with a one-sentence provision.”

Although some Republicans disagree with that, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) announced Monday that the replacement or backup plan will only be released by his chamber should the court rule against the law.

This means the public could potentially never see what would have been in store for them should the case go that direction, especially the 6.4 million people who would have lost subsidies.

Today, President Obama will deliver remarks at the Catholic Hospital Association Conference about the future of healthcare and the ACA.
