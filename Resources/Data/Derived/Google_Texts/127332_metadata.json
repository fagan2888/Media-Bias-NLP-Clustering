James Martin\u2019s insightful overview of Jesuit life and spirituality.\n\nAccording to reports, he\u2019s consulting the book as he prepares to play a Jesuit in a film adaptation of \u201cSilence,\u201d a novel about Catholic missionaries in Japan.\n\nGarfield\u2019s reading material \u2013 and the movie he\u2019s studying for \u2013 captures the continuing cultural impact of the 474-year-old Catholic religious order officially known as the Society of Jesus.\n\nSometimes called \"God's Marines\" (not all appreciate the nickname) for their willingness to go to the frontlines of faith, Jesuits form the largest order of Catholic priests in the church, with approximately 18,000 members worldwide. And, at a time when most religious orders are shrinking and pining for new candidates, the Jesuits say inquiries about joining their ranks are surging.\n\nWhat explains the Jesuits\u2019 enduring appeal?\n\nMuch of it has to do with their academic legacy. In the United States alone, there are 60 Jesuit high schools and 28 Jesuit colleges and universities. They are part of a network of secondary and post-secondary institutions that stretch from Los Angeles to Lagos to Tokyo. A good number of those schools are named after the founder of the Society of Jesus, St. Ignatius of Loyola.\n\nBorn in Spain in 1491, Ignatius \u2013 then I\u00f1igo L\u00f2pez de Loyola \u2013 was groomed for a conventional path in service of the Spanish crown.\n\nKnown as something of a ruffian and a ladies\u2019 man, Inigo entered the military and, in 1521, encountered the French at the Battle of Pamplona, a fight that left his right leg badly wounded by a cannonball.\n\nWith time to pray and reflect, Inigo underwent his remarkable conversion from swashbuckling soldier to spiritual pilgrim. A new man and now disciple, Inigo adopted a new name: Ignatius, which some say marked his newfound respect for St. Ignatius of Antioch.\n\nIn addition to Ignatius\u2019 captivating conversion, his work \u201cThe Spiritual Exercises,\u201d continues to inspire contemporary Catholic movements in education and prayer, and serves as the foundation for all Jesuit ministries. The exercises are essentially a retreat manual, a series of guided meditations that enable people to experience the love of God and strengthen their relationship with Christ.\n\nWith the aide of the Spiritual Exercises, which members of the Society of Jesus are required to periodically revisit, a steady stream of Jesuits from nearly every country and background have shaped the culture, politics, and events of their day.\n\nThere\u2019s Matteo Ricci, the 16th century missionary to China, a polymathic priest and a groundbreaking figure in connecting Asian and European cultures.\n\nThere\u2019s Gerard Manley Hopkins, the nineteenth century English poet, whose verse is regarded as some of the best of the Victorian era and regularly included in poetry anthologies.\n\nAnd there\u2019s Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, the French Jesuit born in 1880 who, as a paleontologist, was instrumental in discovering and examining \u201cPeking man,\u201d and who, as a theologian, remains notable for his efforts to synthesize science and Christianity.\n\nTheir lives demonstrate the ways that a distinctly religious worldview can speak to the world\u2019s needs, an emphasis on practicality that is thoroughly Jesuit in origin. \"Contemplation in action,\" runs one well-known Jesuit motto.\n\n\u201cJesuits, as their tradition insists, can be found in almost every country, in almost every workplace imaginable,\u201d Jonathan Wright writes in his book, \u201cGod\u2019s Soldiers: A History of the Jesuits.\u201d\n\nThat includes war zones, retreat houses, business schools and chemistry labs. There are Jesuit doctors, lawyers, engineers and psychologists, as well as artists and television producers.\n\nIn this variety and geographic reach, the words of one early Jesuit, Jer\u00f3nimo Nadal, ring true: \u201cThe whole world . . . is our house.\u201d\n\nToday, the Jesuits are as well-known as at any time in their history. This popularity starts at the very top of the Catholic Church with Pope Francis, himself a Jesuit for more than 50 years.\n\nIn an extensive interview published last September in America magazine, Francis spoke at length about his Jesuit identity and background.\n\nHe decided to join the society as a young man in Argentina, the Pope said, because he admired its \"missionary spirit, community and discipline,\" even though he was himself not very disciplined.\n\nA key to understanding Pope Francis\n\nHe later came to appreciate Jesuits' open-mindedness and willingness to see God in all things, great and small, Francis said.\n\n\"The Jesuit always thinks, again and again, looking at the horizon toward which he must go, with Christ at the center. This is his real strength. And that pushes the Society to be searching, creative and generous.\"\n\nCatholic leaders who know the Pope well say his Jesuit training is the \"key to understanding\" Francis. \"Pope Francis is the quintessential Ignatian Jesuit,\u201d said Cardinal Sean O'Malley of Boston, one of the Pope's closest confidants.\n\nFor instance, O'Malley said, consider the Pope's decision to wash the feet of a group of prisoners on Holy Thursday in 2013, just after his election as pontiff, instead of following Vatican tradition and celebrating a Mass at St. John Lateran's Archbasilica.\n\n\"With a simple gesture, the Holy Father was challenging core assumptions about power, authority and leadership,\" O'Malley said, adding that his actions \"jostled\" Catholics out of complacency.\n\nFrancis may be the the most well-known Jesuit, but others engage the culture in influential ways as well.\n\nMartin, author of \u201cThe Jesuit Guide to (Almost) Everything,\u201d appears regularly on Comedy Central\u2019s \u201cColbert Report\u201d to discuss topics like heaven and hell, social justice and the latest news from the Vatican. And Jesuits can often be relied upon to converse about more far-out topics \u2013 like really far out.\n\nFor example, Jesuit brother Guy Consolmagno, who recently won the Carl Sagan Medal for communicating science to the public, has co-written a forthcoming book titled \u201cWould You Baptize an Extraterrestrial?\u201d a question that only a Jesuit could love. (Pope Francis, for the record, says yes.)\n\nGiven its history and global presence, you might think the Society of Jesus would closely guard its legacy. But this is one area where the Catholic order breaks with typical expectations.\n\nA hallmark of Ignatian spirituality is the emphasis on remaining indifferent. That doesn't mean apathy or disinterest, but rather a radical availability to the will of God. As Jesuits say, this \u201cIgnatian indifference\u201d is about freedom from attachments that displace God as the center of one\u2019s life.\n\nHow to really measure the 'Francis effect'\n\nThat freedom has imbued the Society of Jesus with a spirit of re-creation for five centuries, and I wouldn't be surprised if it continues to inspire Jesuits for the next 500 years.\n\nOne day my children might enjoy a new technology created by a Jesuit who works at Google or a Jesuit whose path to the priesthood was perhaps inspired by a movie starring a certain Hollywood celebrity.\n\nFather Andrew Garfield? Seems impossible, right?\n\nNot exactly. Read the biography of Ignatius, and you\u2019ll know why.\n\nMatt Emerson blogs for the Jesuit magazine America and teaches theology at Xavier College Preparatory, a Jesuit high school in Palm Desert, California.
