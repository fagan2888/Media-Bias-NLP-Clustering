Now, the women will attempt to give birth to their own children \u2014 a hallmark of the transplant that would become the first of its kind.\n\nWhile limb transplants and the introduction of critical organs have been used with success for decades, uterus transplants are largely an unexplored frontier, or at least an unsuccessfully explored one. And despite the apparent success of giving a woman the chance to give birth, naturally, to her own child, some experts denounce the practice, claiming the quick-timed transplant and subsequent removal provides far more practical health risks than psychological benefits.\n\nThe women comprising the study are all in their thirties and either had their uteri removed, because of a related health concern, or were born without one \u2014 a condition known as M\u00fcllerian agenesis. The condition is also known as Mayer-Rokitansky-K\u00fcster-Hauser syndrome (MRKH), and with the exception of a missing uterus, women with the syndrome still ovulate and maintain proper hormonal balance. The foremost downside, of course, is that women with MRKH are unable to carry a pregnancy. They must rely on surrogacy or in vitro fertilization (IVF). But Swedish doctors now hope the transplantation procedure will alleviate that burden.\n\n\u201cThis is a new kind of surgery,\u201d Dr. Mats Brannstrom, study leader and chair of the obstetrics and gynecology department at the University of Gothenburg, told The Associated Press. \u201cWe have no textbook to look at.\u201d\n\nPrevious attempts at transplanting wombs resulted in the patients\u2019 bodies failing to \u201ctake,\u201d or accept, the new organs, forcing doctors to remove them. But so far, many of the women in Brannstrom\u2019s study have already had their periods six weeks after the transplant. One woman suffered an infection from the new womb, and a few others faced brief bouts of rejection, but all left the hospital within a few days, the AP reported.\n\nThe Cost-Benefit Analysis Of Uterus Transplants\n\nUltimately, the doctors hope each woman is able to give birth to her own child. They\u2019ve allowed a maximum of two pregnancies before they remove the temporary womb, as the immunosuppressive anti-rejection medicine significantly increases a woman\u2019s risk for high blood pressure, swelling, diabetes, and both uterine and cervical cancer. But these risks worry doctors who don\u2019t see the act of delivering one\u2019s own child as sufficient motivation for a woman to expose herself to such risks.\n\nDr. Kenneth F. Trofatter argues in an editorial for Healthline that the procedure carries no direct benefit for a female patient. \u201cIndeed, the risks involved far outweigh any purported psychological benefits to women who were born without, or have prematurely lost, their uteri,\u201d he explained. \u201cThe practitioners who will do this procedure will \u2018be the first\u2019 (and for that will obtain some degree of fame, or notoriety) but there is likely to be no major contribution to medical knowledge or technology that will come out of this procedure either.\u201d\n\nThe women involved in Brannstrom\u2019s study can\u2019t get pregnant naturally, as the transplanted uteri aren\u2019t connected to the women\u2019s fallopian tubes. Prior to the study, researchers preserved the women\u2019s eggs to be fertilized, and the resulting embryos will be transferred into the wombs to develop. Trofatter argues this process is unnecessarily complicated, based more on foolhardy pride rather than smart medical science.\n\n\u201cTo be the first woman with a transplanted uterus to take this chance on a baby is, in my opinion, a selfish and foolish proposition,\u201d he wrote.\n\nAmong the other concerns is whether a live donor is preferable to a deceased one. In the prior Turkish studies, the donor was dead. And while one woman got pregnant, ultimately it failed in two months\u2019 time. Beside the myriad risks of rejection \u2014 an ill-connected placenta may fail to adequately nourish the developing fetus, for instance \u2014 British researchers also view the practice of live donation for a non-lifesaving procedure as unethical.\n\nIn the meantime, Trofatter\u2019s concerns are mostly ethnocentric. IVF and surrogacy may be legal in the United States, but in many countries abroad the techniques are still outlawed. The experimental procedure of uterus transplantation offers a hope, albeit a risky one, but a hope nonetheless, to the one out of every 4,500 women born without a uterus who still wishes to bear children. The primary obstacle is securing the procedure\u2019s safety in bringing it to the mainstream.\n\n\u201cWhat remains to be seen,\u201d Dr. Yacoub Khalaf, director of the Assisted Conception unit at Guy\u2019s and St. Thomas\u2019 hospital in London, told the AP, \u201cis whether this is a viable option or if this is going to be confined to research and limited experimentation.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "uterus transplants, swedish doctors, 9 uterus transplants, live donor, cervical cancer, uterine cancer, womb transplant", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Swedish doctors have successfully transplanted nine uteri into female patients, but can each woman's pregnancy reach full term?", "title": "Uterus Transplants Open Door For Pregnancy, But Little Else", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/swedish-doctors-perform-9-uterus-transplants-pregnancy-possible-womb-recipients-what-costs-266959", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/01/13/shutterstock83099920.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Swedish doctors have successfully transplanted nine uteri into female patients, but can each woman's pregnancy reach full term?", "title": "Uterus Transplants Open Door For Pregnancy, But Little Else", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/swedish-doctors-perform-9-uterus-transplants-pregnancy-possible-womb-recipients-what-costs-266959", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/01/13/shutterstock83099920.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/01/13/shutterstock83099920.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Consumer News", "published_time": "2014-01-13T12:10:23-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-01-13T12:23:25-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Swedish doctors have successfully transplanted nine uteri into female patients, but can each woman's pregnancy reach full term?"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd223\"", "article_summary": "The condition is also known as Mayer-Rokitansky-K\u00fcster-Hauser syndrome (MRKH), and with the exception of a missing uterus, women with the syndrome still ovulate and maintain proper hormonal balance.\nThe Cost-Benefit Analysis Of Uterus TransplantsUltimately, the doctors hope each woman is able to give birth to her own child.\nBut so far, many of the women in Brannstrom\u2019s study have already had their periods six weeks after the transplant.\nThe foremost downside, of course, is that women with MRKH are unable to carry a pregnancy.\nBut Swedish doctors now hope the transplantation procedure will alleviate that burden."}
