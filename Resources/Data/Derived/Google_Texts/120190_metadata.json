Make sure you have proper life jackets for the people on board your vessel, make sure they're not torn or tattered,\" said Officer Hanson.\n\nThose in the industry say boating has grown significantly in the area over the years, but more people on the water means more risk for accidents.\n\n\"It's a percentage game if you triple the amount of kayakers, and triple the amount of boaters, then you're probably gonna triple the amount of accidents without the proper education,\" said Brad Stephens, Owner of Sun Jammers.\n\nAnd with more boaters, officials with the FWC have seen a spike in drinking and boating. Drew Nelson says in the majority of the accidents he investigates, alcohol plays a role.\n\n\"The atmosphere is fun, it's recreation, it's having a good time, part of that is the consumption of alcohol and you just need to be aware that it needs to be in moderation and you need to have a designated operator same as having a designated driver on the highway,\" said Nelson.\n\nAs boaters hit the water, Nelson wants them to have fun, but cautions them to remember their priority is safety.\n\nNelson encourages anyone involved in boating to take a boater educational course. He says with the right knowledge, most accidents can be prevented.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "Memorial Day weekend is sometimes called the kick off to the summer season, and this weekend the holiday has brought hundreds of locals out on the water.
