Ron Johnson come up with a \u2018strategy,\u2019 is an excellent example, says talk radio personality Pete Dominick.\n\nIf you want to know what led to the government shutdown, all you need to do is listen to the argument between the popular conservative radio host Mark Levin and Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI). Johnson, one of the most conservative senators in the country, was elected in the 2010 Tea Party wave. Since the beginning of the shutdown crisis, I and many others have argued that the issue is between moderate and extreme Republicans, not Republicans and Democrats. The Levin-Johnson argument demonstrates that point perfectly.\n\nAt the height of the shutdown crisis, Levin demanded that Johnson come up with a \u201cstrategy\u201d to defund Obamacare and accomplish everything Levin, his listeners, and supporters want. That\u2019s just plain silly. It\u2019s not possible. The strategy Levin supports is great for ratings but terrible for the country and the Republican Party.\n\nPlease understand: Johnson is a really, really, really conservative guy. Like, way out there on the right. He says, believes, and votes in a very conservative way. He voted against the Employment Non Discrimination Act. He has an \u201cA\u201d rating from the National Rifle Association. He doesn\u2019t believe abortion should be legal. He believes marriage should be only between consenting adults with opposing reproductive organs. He doesn\u2019t trust scientists on climate change. He even voted against a bill to benefit the disabled and supported by former Republican leader and World War II veteran Bob Dole. In front of Dole! On the Senate floor! I looked hard to find Johnson saying or voting for anything a liberal American would agree with and came up empty.\n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s unfair or insulting to say Johnson lives on the far right of American political thinking. However, he is still a senator, not a talk show host like Levin. It\u2019s easy to achieve your goal\u2014getting ratings and entertaining people\u2014when you are as smart and talented as Levin is. But a senator has a much harder task. He has to work with others whom he is often at complete odds with. He can\u2019t hang up on someone who disagrees with him if he wants to get things done. To pass or repeal laws, he needs the votes. Johnson and his Republican friends in the U.S. Senate don\u2019t have them, no matter how much Levin and others like him yell and scream.\n\nSenators understand that at the end of the day, their job is to get something done. It certainly doesn\u2019t hurt to have the support of a radio host with millions of listeners telling the audience how to vote and whom to pressure, but if the votes aren\u2019t there, you can\u2019t repeal a law.\n\nThe job of a terrestrial radio show host, on the other hand, is to entertain and sell advertising and, in Levin\u2019s case, books. He has written quite a few bestsellers.\n\nLevin and other radio performers, commentators, and columnists see it as their responsibility to demand purity on every vote and issue. They gain respect and larger audiences the more they vent the anger and frustration of their listeners by calling people names and hanging up on those who argue with them. If there is nothing to be outraged by, it\u2019s their job to create something. That is how it works in radio. But that isn\u2019t how it works in Washington, D.C., or any state capital in America.\n\nDemanding that Johnson come up with a strategy to repeal Obamacare or else destroy the economy and the country is absurd. Talking tough to a senator and speaking truth to power is respectable. Demanding they develop the powers of a Jedi is crazy. Levin is an expert on the Constitution, but no matter how loud he yells, he isn\u2019t going to get the president of the United States to repeal a pathway to affordable insurance coverage for hardworking Americans who have never been able to get it.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "u.s. poli, Wisconsin,United States, Tea Party, Obamacare, government shutdown", "publicationDate": 201310182020, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/politics", "description": "Talk radio personality Pete Dominick on how the Mark Levin-Ron Johnson fight explains the shutdown perfectly.", "pageNum": 1, "title": "Mark Levin-Ron Johnson Fight Explains the Shutdown Perfectly", "tags": "topic:politics,entity:provinceorstate/wisconsin_united_states,entity:organization/tea_party,Obamacare:Industryterm,entity:politicalevent/government_shutdown", "environment": "dev", "platform": "desktop", "template": "article", "type": "house", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"Mark Levin-Ron Johnson Fight Explains the Shutdown Perfectly\",\"link\":\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/10/18/mark-levin-ron-johnson-fight-explains-the-shutdown-perfectly.html\",\"image_url\":\"http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2013/10/18/mark-levin-ron-johnson-fight-explains-the-shutdown-perfectly/jcr:content/image.crop.410.273.jpg/46070912.cached.jpg\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":\"/content/dailybeast/articles/2013/10/18/mark-levin-ron-johnson-fight-explains-the-shutdown-perfectly\",\"pub_date\":\"2013-10-18T20:20:00+00:00\",\"section\":\"Politics\",\"author\":\"Pete Dominick\",\"tags\":[\"politics\",\"wisconsin_united_states\",\"tea_party\",\"Industryterm\",\"government_shutdown\"]}", "news_keywords": "US Politics, Wisconsin United States, Tea Party, Obamacare, government shutdown", "sectionTaxanomies": "politics", "fb": {"admins": "1703087,30000737,1117577220,1276800108,931159,514915512", "app_id": 189930913679}, "authors": "Pete Dominick", "article": {"section": "politics", "published_time": "2013-10-18T20:20:00.000Z", "author": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/contributors/pete-dominickhtml"}, "resourceType": "dailybeast2/components/pages/article", "contentpath": "/content/dailybeast/articles/2013/10/18/mark-levin-ron-johnson-fight-explains-the-shutdown-perfectly", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Beast", "description": "Talk radio personality Pete Dominick on how the Mark Levin-Ron Johnson fight explains the shutdown perfectly.", "title": "Mark Levin-Ron Johnson Fight Explains the Shutdown Perfectly", "url": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/10/18/mark-levin-ron-johnson-fight-explains-the-shutdown-perfectly.html", "image": "http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2013/10/18/mark-levin-ron-johnson-fight-explains-the-shutdown-perfectly/jcr:content/image.img.2000.jpg/1382127373863.cached.jpg", "type": "article"}, "authorIds": "/etc/authors/p/pete-dominick", "content-type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0f96\"", "article_summary": "The strategy Levin supports is great for ratings but terrible for the country and the Republican Party.\nIf you want to know what led to the government shutdown, all you need to do is listen to the argument between the popular conservative radio host Mark Levin and Sen.
