Just over a year after her last project, Sarah Murdoch made a guest appearance on Seven's Weekend Sunrise.\n\nThe Sunday Telegraph can reveal that Mrs Murdoch, after turning up early yesterday morning as surprise guest host, is considering an offer for a full-time gig next year. The move comes as Channel 10 prepares to launch its own player into the breakfast TV wars with Wake Up! and Studio Ten.\n\nAlthough Mrs Murdoch is on a rival network, she says husband and Ten chairman Lachlan Murdoch supports her no matter what her career choices.\n\n\"He encourages and always supports me to do my own thing and do what makes me happy and to do what I enjoy,\" she said.\n\nInsiders say Mrs Murdoch is clear frontrunner for a full-time Weekend Sunrise gig. She would take over from Samantha Armytage who was promoted to become the weekday Sunrise host.\n\n\"This is about what I would like to do and what is a challenge for me,\" Mrs Murdoch says.\n\nMrs Murdoch, of course, is no stranger to morning television having co-hosted Today with Karl Stefanovic in 2007. Since then she also spent three seasons on Australia's Next Top Model as host and co-executive producer but says breakfast TV hosting is and has always been her first love.\n\n\"I really like the weekend format as opposed to weekdays,\" she says. \"It's a bit more relaxed and you can spend a bit more time on interviews and things.\n\n\"And I'm always up for a new challenge, so I thought I'd give it a go.\"\n\nIt helps, too, that she respects Weekend Sunrise co-host Andrew O'Keefe.\n\nIt adds to what is seen as good chemistry between the pair - something Sunrise boss Michael Pell says makes up a huge part of putting together an on-air team.\n\n\"As with all breakfast TV, chemistry is everything,\" Pell says.", "article_metadata": {"description": "LOOK who's back on TV.
