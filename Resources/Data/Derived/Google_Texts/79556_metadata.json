We have a primary process that won\u2019t graduate anyone who loves the gays too much but a general election that could, for the first time, punish anyone who loves the gays too little.\n\nAnd so we must calibrate. Triangulate. Pink triangulation, let\u2019s call it.\n\nThis is our mission, manifest in semantic loop-de-loops and oratorical gobbledygook from candidates like Scott Walker, who recently reminisced about an unnamed relative\u2019s same-sex nuptials. Observe how he handled that: by making clear that he didn\u2019t go to the ceremony, only to the reception. That\u2019s called having your wedding cake (presumably from a baker with no religious objections) and eating it, too. Also note Ted Cruz. Out of one corner of his routinely scowling mouth, he speaks of a \u201cjihad\u201d by the gays to force even stern Christians like him to endorse same-sex marriage. Out of the other, he says that if one of his daughters came out as a lesbian, no worries!\n\nTed trumpeted this tolerance during a fund-raising sweep through New York City, at a meet-and-greet hosted by two wealthy gays. There are two lessons in his relaxed posture. First, fashion different words for different ZIP codes. Second, remember that as loud as Scripture talks, money talks even louder, and some gays have oodles of it.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLet\u2019s fill in a bit of background. We here on the Image Rehabilitation Subcommittee, convened after the 2012 defeat and those unfortunate references to immigrant self-deportation, have reached the conclusion that the gay issue poses real peril for the party. And that\u2019s not so much because a recent survey found that as many as 60 percent of Americans now support same-sex marriage. Most of those Americans don\u2019t vote for a candidate based on his or her position on two men or two women tying the knot. Gay marriage isn\u2019t their first priority and possibly not even their fifth.\n\nBut Americans have rallied around the gays to a point where beating up on them just looks crotchety and mean, the precise qualities that we are trying to move the party\u2019s image past. When some Americans in their 20s say that they would never vote for us, it is not because they dislike us on the small-government or limited-regulation fronts. It is not because they think Democrats are better stewards of the economy. It is not about abortion.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "opinion", "ptime": 20150425143027, "twitter": {"description": "What a knotty predicament Republicans are in.", "creator": "FrankBruni", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/26/opinion/sunday/frank-bruni-the-gops-gay-pretzels.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003648552"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "title": "The G.O.P.\u2019s Gay Pretzels", "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/01/opinion/bruni-circular/bruni-circular-thumbLarge-v7.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/26/opinion/sunday/frank-bruni-the-gops-gay-pretzels.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003648552", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/26/opinion/sunday/frank-bruni-the-gops-gay-pretzels.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion/sunday", "hdl_p": "The G.O.P.\u2019s Gay Pretzels", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "April 25, 2015", "edt": "NewYork", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/b/frank_bruni/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "modified": "2015-04-30", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Rubio, Marco", "published": "2015-04-25", "section-taxonomy-id": "AD8090D7-4137-4D71-84C8-70DA3BD89778"}, "keywords": "Same-Sex Marriage  Civil Unions and Domestic Partnerships,Presidential Election of 2016,United States Politics and Government,Homosexuality and Bisexuality,Republican Party,Discrimination,Cruz  Ted,Jindal  Bobby,Christie  Christopher J,Rubio  Marco", "description": "What a knotty predicament Republicans are in.", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Frank Bruni", "SCG": "sunday", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "per": "Rubio, Marco", "slug": "26bruni", "byl": "By FRANK BRUNI", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "What a knotty predicament Republicans are in.", "tom": "Op-Ed", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "utime": 20150430150838, "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/01/opinion/bruni-circular/bruni-circular-thumbStandard-v5.jpg", "news_keywords": "Discrimination", "CN": "frank-bruni", "CG": "opinion", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "April 25, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "Op-Ed", "org": "Republican Party", "thumbnail_height": 75, "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "CT": "column", "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/26/opinion/sunday/frank-bruni-the-gops-gay-pretzels.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/01/opinion/bruni-circular/bruni-circular-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "What a knotty predicament Republicans are in.", "title": "The G.O.P.\u2019s Gay Pretzels"}, "pdate": 20150425, "des": "Discrimination", "nyt-collection": {"tone": "opinion", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/column/frank-bruni", "tagline": "Politics, social issues, education and culture.", "uri": "/column/frank-bruni", "display-name": "Frank Bruni", "identifier": "frank-bruni", "type": "column"}, "col": "Op-Ed Columnist", "articleid": 100000003648552, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "The G.O.P.\u2019s Gay Pretzels", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/01/opinion/bruni-circular/bruni-circular-thumbLarge-v7.jpg", "PST": "Op-Ed"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfb8a\"", "article_summary": "Gay marriage isn\u2019t their first priority and possibly not even their fifth.\nAnd that\u2019s not so much because a recent survey found that as many as 60 percent of Americans now support same-sex marriage.\nSecond, remember that as loud as Scripture talks, money talks even louder, and some gays have oodles of it.\nOut of one corner of his routinely scowling mouth, he speaks of a \u201cjihad\u201d by the gays to force even stern Christians like him to endorse same-sex marriage.\nRE: Our big, fat gay predicamentDear Gentlemen and Carly Fiorina,No matter how much we\u2019d like the ceaseless chatter about gay marriage to go away, it won\u2019t, not with the Supreme Court about to hear another round of arguments on the issue and not with this inextinguishable debate over \u201creligious freedom\u201d laws."}
