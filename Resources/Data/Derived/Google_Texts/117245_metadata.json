I procured it from my university health center and charged it to my student account. I wasn\u2019t entirely sure if my dad would notice the $50 monthly charge (with insurance) for my Nuvaring, but the price was more than I could afford out of pocket. So each month, feeling infantilized and slightly guilty for putting contraception on my parents\u2019 tab, I did what I had to do to avoid pregnancy.\n\nThat sinking feeling was nowhere to be found the next time I\u2019d go on birth control.\n\nWhile living in London after I graduated, I turned up to a sexual health clinic in Soho with no appointment. I filled out some light paperwork and waited in a room filled with copies of Vogue and bowls of sweets. I paused when they asked me what I\u2019d like to be tested for; nearly 21 years of U.S. health insurance had instilled in me a fear of \u201croutine\u201d $400 blood tests. But my fears were unfounded. After being tested for the full gamut of potential ailments free of charge, a nurse practitioner talked to me about what kind of contraceptives I wanted. She then handed me a year\u2019s worth of birth control in a brown paper bag, also completely free. A week later, the clinic sent me my results via text message.\n\nRelated This is what it's like to go back to work at a clinic after an anti-abortion terrorist attack\n\nI\u2019ve repeated the same routine every year since, and each time I leave the clinic thinking: \u201cI\u2019ve had hair appointments that were more complicated.\u201d\n\n\u201cit\u2019s fair to say that if you have an unwanted pregnancy\u2026you can get an abortion on the NHS.\u201d\n\nAs a feminist and an American citizen, I\u2019ve always been infuriated by conservative lawmakers\u2019 fixation on legislating my vagina. Now, as a British citizen who has spent the last five years getting acquainted with this nation\u2019s government-funded National Health Service (NHS), I\u2019m baffled by it, too. Having lived in a country where reproductive health care\u2014including abortions\u2014is free, accessible, and far less politicized, it\u2019s never been clearer to me just how regressive the U.S really is.\n\nIn 2012, the Affordable Care Act\u2019s birth control provision went into effect. It mandated that employers must provide insurance that includes free access to certain forms of contraceptives, and it appeared to signal America\u2019s move out of the reproductive dark ages. But it hasn\u2019t exactly been smooth sailing since then. That same birth control mandate has had the highest number of lawsuits challenging its validity than any other provision of the ACA, one of which was the high-profile Burwell vs. Hobby Lobby Supreme Court case in 2014.\n\nLast month, SCOTUS agreed to hear a new bundle of seven cases in March 2016. The claimants\u2019 beef is with the government\u2019s workaround: They say the requirement that employers provide written notification of their religious objection\u2014which allows the government to work with the insurance company to provide an alternative for a female employee\u2014is a contraceptive \u201ctrigger\u201d and forces objectors to \u201c[violate] their religious beliefs or [pay] the heavy fines.\u201d Apparently the federal government\u2019s concession to religious objectors was not enough; those same objectors now want to prevent the government itself from providing birth control to employees in their stead.\n\nAs the highest court in the land ponders whether to give the archaic whims of a tiny slice of religious objectors more influence than laws passed by the democratically-elected government, it\u2019s worth considering what it\u2019s like to live in a country where these all are moot points. If nothing else, it serves as a good reminder for reproductive health advocates that all hope is not lost.\n\nMy first seamless experience at a NHS-funded sexual health clinic was not a fluke. In a report on contraception access in the EU, the Center for Reproductive Rights considers the UK a leader in terms of best practice, and according to UN data, the UK has one of the highest rates of contraceptive usage in Northern Europe (84%). According to Ann Furedi, the chief executive of the British Pregnancy Advisory Service, it\u2019s because the NHS goes out of its way to make contraception free and accessible to UK women. They start by waiving the flat fee applied to all prescriptions in Britain (a mere \u00a38.20, or just over $12). Many clinics like the one I visited in Soho operate on a convenient walk-in basis, and appointments\u2014whether with a woman\u2019s regular doctor or at a walk-in clinic\u2014are always free.\n\n\u201cIn the UK, what politicians really want is for people to be using contraception and to be using it well,\u201d Furedi told me. \u201cEspecially political conservatives, who are wary of benefit culture, believe that family planning is a very good thing.\u201d She chalks this up to \u201cthe whole British idea of restraint,\u201d the idea that it\u2019s \u201cresponsible to have only as many children as you can care for properly.\u201d\n\nFuredi says from the UK government\u2019s perspective, both contraception and abortion fall squarely in the realm of public health, not ideology or ethics. It isn\u2019t that Britain is free of bitter partisan divides. It\u2019s also not a particularly progressive nation when it comes to gender equality (just look at the gender ratio of Parliament or the topless, scantily clad women on Page 3 of the nation\u2019s most-read newspaper, The Sun). It\u2019s just that my reproductive system is, quite rightly, not a point of political contention.\n\nAbortion is a little murkier than birth control in terms of public perception, but still unambiguous when it comes to the law. Abortion has been legal and free in the first 24 weeks of pregnancy on the NHS since 1967 in England, Scotland and Wales.* Though there are still practitioners who may refuse to perform a later-term abortion on grounds of competency or conscience, the general attitude is one of neutrality. (For proof, look no further than the NHS\u2019s webpage on the topic. It includes \u201cpersonal circumstances\u201d as first on a list of reasons why a woman might choose to end a pregnancy.) When stigmatization or \u201cconscientious objection\u201d does happen, they\u2019re more localized and don\u2019t come from a top-down, institutional level like they do in America.\n\nBottom line, Furedi says, is that while access is not perfect, \u201cit\u2019s fair to say that if you have an unwanted pregnancy\u2026you can get an abortion on the NHS.\u201d\n\n\u201cI really felt that it all came back to it being about my welfare and my well being.\u201d\n\nLorraine Hosie is 37 and has had two abortions on the NHS, one early in her twenties and one just recently. She says that the second time, she was impressed by the non-judgmental, caring approach of the NHS doctors and felt that any questioning about her choice was only to ensure she was not being pressured into it by someone else.\n\n\u201cThe doctor mentioned to me that, at 37, I\u2019m running out of years to have a baby,\u201d Hosie told me. But \u201c[s]he wasn\u2019t warning me\u2014I really felt that it all came back to it being about my welfare and my well being.\u201d\n\nHosie was given an option of which type of procedure she preferred, and what hospital would be most convenient. And of course, the entire thing was free.\n\nIt\u2019s not that some abortion providers and doctors in the U.S. don\u2019t also offer the same kind of practical and compassionate care Hosie received on the NHS. It\u2019s just that they are forced to operate under a federal system that legislates to please religious minorities at the expense of women. Even the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to hear religious objectors\u2019 cases validates the notion that a woman\u2019s access to contraception and her choice of whether or not to have a baby is a privilege, not a right.\n\nLiving in the UK, I\u2019ve learned what it feels like when free, unimpeded access reproductive health is considered my basic human right. So to the American feminists fighting this battle across the pond, take it from me: You shouldn\u2019t be settling for anything less.\n\n*Northern Ireland, though it is part of the United Kingdom and covered by the NHS, still considers abortion illegal, though a high court ruling last month hinted at change.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://fusion.net/wp-content/themes/fusion-theme/assets/images/favicons/browserconfig.xml?v=1462067892199", "msapplication-TileColor": "#da532c", "description": "I fled the U.S. to live in a place where my uterus isn't a political football.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Fusion", "description": "Now that I live in a country where women's healthcare is free, accessible, and far less politicized, it\u2019s never been clearer how regressive the U.S really is.", "title": "Life in a magical land where abortions and birth control are free and plentiful", "url": "http://fusion.net/story/242988/europe-free-birth-control-abortions/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://i1.wp.com/fusion.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/5230071985_40108218b2_b.jpg?resize=1200%2C630&quality=80&strip=all", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Now that I live in a country where women's healthcare is free, accessible, and far less politicized, it\u2019s never been clearer how regressive the U.S really is.", "title": "Life in a magical land where abortions and birth control are free and", "url": "http://fusion.net/story/242988/europe-free-birth-control-abortions/", "image": "http://i1.wp.com/fusion.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/5230071985_40108218b2_b.jpg?resize=560%2C294&quality=80&strip=all", "site": "@fusion", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Fusion.net", "pocket-site-verification": "81a5587d6c56043280b2554922f43d", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6a5260d31ead375c331934cb6df4833"}, "fb": {"app_id": 796694167041552}, "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://fusion.net/wp-content/themes/fusion-theme/assets/images/favicons/mstile-144x144.png?v=1462067892199", "application-name": "Fusion.net", "msvalidate.01": "0EABD001D404EA9DDE2025E9E4F14CAF", "google-site-verification": "BKw_9qDU04u2w1WoNF53fplAwWXVK_DJ1b6rZDR5u-M", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "birth control, abortion, NHS, ACA, obamacare, reproductive rights, health insurance"}, "article_summary": "She then handed me a year\u2019s worth of birth control in a brown paper bag, also completely free.\nThe first time I used hormonal birth control was in college at the University of California.\nThat sinking feeling was nowhere to be found the next time I\u2019d go on birth control.\nIn 2012, the Affordable Care Act\u2019s birth control provision went into effect.\nAbortion is a little murkier than birth control in terms of public perception, but still unambiguous when it comes to the law."}
