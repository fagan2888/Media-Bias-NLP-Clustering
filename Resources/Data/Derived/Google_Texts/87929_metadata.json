Surface repairs for rail crossings are the responsibility of the railroad, in this case Burlington Northern Santa Fe. ( Johnnie St. Vrain/ Longmont Times-Call )\n\nDear Johnnie: Regarding rail crossings, a number of them around town have been wonderfully repaired in a way that seems will really last. For example, Third Avenue at Hover Street, Colo. 66 east of Main. They have done a very good job on these and a number of others.\n\nOne that needs attention is 21st Avenue east of Main. If taken at any speed higher than 5 mph, it will do damage to the car. Until it could be fixed, it would be good to have a sign both ways warning of \"bad bump.\" Don't know if you have any clout with the powers that be who would be responsible to take some action. Thanks for your attention. \u2014 Jerry\u200b\n\nDear Johnnie: Who is responsible for the repair of train crossings?\n\nThe crossing on Ninth Avenue between Hover and Airport results in a \"shake, rattle, and roll\" for any car driving over it. The wooden planks between the rails are very worn down in spots, and there is no way to avoid them. With the 45 mph speed limit on that stretch of road, it results in quite a jar! I'm sure last year's flood didn't help the crossing's condition either.\n\nAs someone who must travel this road several times a day, I'm wondering whether it's the city or the railroads who should fix this crossing for us. \u2014 Shaked, Rattled, and Rolled\n\nDear Jerry and Shake: Ultimately the surface repairs for rail crossings are the responsibility of the railroad, in this case Burlington Northern Santa Fe.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat answer came from Tom Street, engineering administrator with the city's engineering services department.\n\nWhen it comes to the kind of \"smoother riding precast concrete panel system\" found at Third and Hover, he noted, the railroad typically requires financial participation from the city.\n\nStreet said that in the coming year, the Public Works & Natural Resources department will inspect several crossings to determine the highest priority. \"Then we will start coordination with the BNSF RR to upgrade one crossing with the precast concrete panel system,\" Street said in an email reply to your questions.\n\nHe warned that the agreement process with a railroad typically takes \"a considerable amount of time.\"\n\n\"So in the meantime we will determine if the Ninth Avenue (near Airport Road) and the 21st Avenue crossings require any urgent approach repairs or if appropriate signage is in order.\"\n\nSend questions to johnnie@times-call.com.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.timescall.com/columnists/johnnie-st-vrain/ci_27183499/johnnie-st-vrain-who-fixes-teeth-rattling-railroad", "modificationDate": "2014-12-22T08:47:30-0700", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2014/1221/20141221__22TCAJSVw~1_300.jpg", "endDate": "2024-12-21T17:31:47-0700", "description": "Dear Johnnie: Regarding rail crossings, a number of them around town have been wonderfully repaired in a way that seems will really last.", "ag": {"canon": "LongmontTimes-Call:article:27183499:view"}, "startDate": "2014-12-21T17:31:47-0700", "og": {"url": "http://www.timescall.com/columnists/johnnie-st-vrain/ci_27183499/johnnie-st-vrain-who-fixes-teeth-rattling-railroad", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2014/1221/20141221__22TCAJSVw~1.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Dear Johnnie: Regarding rail crossings, a number of them around town have been wonderfully repaired in a way that seems will really last.", "title": "Johnnie St. Vrain: Who fixes teeth-rattling railroad crossings?"}, "twitter": {"domain": "timescall.com", "description": "Dear Johnnie: Regarding rail crossings, a number of them around town have been wonderfully repaired in a way that seems will really last.", "title": "Johnnie St. Vrain: Who fixes teeth-rattling railroad crossings?", "url": "http://www.timescall.com/columnists/johnnie-st-vrain/ci_27183499/johnnie-st-vrain-who-fixes-teeth-rattling-railroad", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2014/1221/20141221__22TCAJSVw~1.jpg", "site": "@TimesCall", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-12-21T17:31:47-0700", "sailthru.site": "timescall.com", "sailthru.title": "Johnnie St. Vrain: Who fixes teeth-rattling railroad crossings?", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Johnnie St. Vrain", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "google-site-verification": "lLtD9ZooxmJUEEdRSCVzkO06t_hYKtyDqZF7EA3N2U0", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2014/1221/20141221__22TCAJSVw~1.jpg", "pubDate": "2014-12-21T17:33:34-0700"}, "article_summary": "( Johnnie St. Vrain/ Longmont Times-Call )Dear Johnnie: Regarding rail crossings, a number of them around town have been wonderfully repaired in a way that seems will really last.\nSurface repairs for rail crossings are the responsibility of the railroad, in this case Burlington Northern Santa Fe.\nFor example, Third Avenue at Hover Street, Colo. 66 east of Main.\n\u2014 Shaked, Rattled, and RolledDear Jerry and Shake: Ultimately the surface repairs for rail crossings are the responsibility of the railroad, in this case Burlington Northern Santa Fe.\n\"So in the meantime we will determine if the Ninth Avenue (near Airport Road) and the 21st Avenue crossings require any urgent approach repairs or if appropriate signage is in order.\""}
