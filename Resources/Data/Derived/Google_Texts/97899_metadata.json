Xavier held up renderings of athletes, of his family, of an alien robot.\n\n\u201cDrawing makes me feel better,\u201d Xavier said. \u201cWhen I\u2019m mad, I draw my anger, and I just get happy.\u201d\n\nHe learned to do that through an art therapy program designed to provide critical coping skills for children growing up in tough circumstances.\n\nXavier and DaShawn live in a public housing project in North Philadelphia, where their mother, Aisha, frets constantly about drug dealing and shootings. Xavier\u2019s father walked away years ago; DaShawn\u2019s became abusive. Their stepfather doesn\u2019t live with them for fear his criminal record could jeopardize their public housing.\n\nTheir living conditions could set them up for more dangers. A growing body of scientific evidence has linked childhood traumas like parental divorce and living in unsafe neighborhoods to potentially lifelong afflictions, from diabetes and heart disease to depression and substance abuse.\n\n\u201cAlmost every single major killer of adults can somehow be traced back to adverse childhood experiences,\u201d said Daniel Taylor, director of community pediatrics and child advocacy at St. Christopher\u2019s Hospital for Children.\n\nThe art therapy program Xavier and DaShawn attend - run out of Drexel University\u2019s Stephen and Sandra Sheller 11th Street Family Health Services Center, through a collaboration with Spring Garden School, a neighborhood public school - is a response to that.\n\nIt\u2019s one of many ways health-care providers are starting to work under the assumption that virtually all children in poor neighborhoods are growing up with trauma, and that even small interventions could transform the outlook not just for the child, but for the whole family.\n\nThe 11th Street health center, which opened in North Philadelphia in 1996, recently doubled its size to about 34,000 square feet, adding space for art, dance, and music therapies. From its primary-care offices to its dental practice, pharmacy, fitness center, and teaching kitchen, the entire center works from this \u201ctrauma-informed\u201d care model.\n\n\u201cInstead of asking, \u2018What\u2019s wrong with you?\u2019 we ask, \u2018What happened to you?\u2019 \u201d said Patty Gerrity, director of the center and an associate dean at Drexel\u2019s College of Nursing and Health Professions. \u201cWe just assume everyone\u2019s been traumatized, and we don\u2019t want to retraumatize them.\u201d\n\nThat assumption is based in part on two decades of working at the center, at the nexus of several public-housing projects. It is also based on a survey of 11th Street patients that found 94 percent had been exposed to one or more childhood traumas, known in academia as adverse childhood experiences, or ACEs.\n\nOften, family members have been traumatized for generations, Gerrity said. So, working with Spring Garden School, Gerrity hopes to start with children and then connect parents and siblings with care, too.\n\nNow in its second year, the program \u201ctargets kids who we know are living with trauma, but whose families might not traditionally seek out behavioral health care,\u201d said Lindsay Edwards, 11th Street\u2019s director of creative arts therapy. \u201cThere are a lot of kids in this community who aren\u2019t being diagnosed with a mental-health disorder who are living with friends being shot and killed or with their parents having a substance-abuse problem.\u201d\n\nThe program is funded with grants and staffed by an art therapy intern.\n\nSara Turley, a technology teacher at Spring Garden School, coordinates the program but is not paid for that work. The school has a counselor only two days a week and no assistant principal to handle the task.\n\nTurley and other teachers have referred about 20 children, ages 6 to 12. Some had acted out in class, or seemed angry or depressed, or were unable to control their tempers when provoked.\n\n\u201cMany of our children just do not have coping skills,\u201d Turley said.\n\nEven an hour a week of art therapy has made an impact, said Turley, who says she has noticed a reduction in bullying and disruptions.\n\nShe described one student who \u201ccouldn\u2019t identify with her peers, and she didn\u2019t fit in. One of the very first activities was they had a bunch of color swatches on the table, and you had to pick the color that described what you were feeling. This girl picked black. I remember thinking, \u2018Oh gosh, to be 12 and to feel black!\u2019 \u201c\n\nBut over the weeks, she made progress - and friends. When they repeated the exercise again, she chose the color yellow.\n\n\u201cThis program really helped to kind of save her,\u201d Turley said. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the things that\u2019s working to change the culture of the school.\u201d\n\nNext up, Edwards and Gerrity hope to collect data to show the impact is more than anecdotal. That evidence would help secure ongoing funding.\n\nEdwards, a dance-movement therapist, said creative arts therapy can be effective when children might not be ready to address traumas head-on.\n\nIt\u2019s also been useful for adult patients at 11th Street whose histories of trauma kept them from getting needed care.\n\nFor instance, a dentist referred a client who couldn\u2019t lie back with mouth open wide because of having been sexually abused, Edwards said.\n\nBreakthroughs are disturbingly frequent. She mentioned a client who, in therapy, suddenly recalled having been molested.\n\n\u201cI see something like that almost every day, because I\u2019m working with clients who have had horrific things happen to them.\u201d\n\nIn 2012, Sandra Bloom, a Drexel public-health professor, co-founded the citywide Philadelphia ACE Task Force, in part to spread the word about childhood trauma as a public-health problem.\n\n\u201cWe have all this science that describes what happens to the brains of children who are not adequately nurtured and protected. We know now that it affects the central nervous system,\u201d she said.\n\nShe likens it to secondhand smoke, which was once inescapable. After scientists documented the danger, policies and laws were adopted to limit children\u2019s exposure.\n\n\u201cThe issue of childhood adversity is much bigger. But if we could reduce interpersonal violence, if we could make homes, communities, and schools safer, then we could have a healthier population, both physically and mentally.\u201d\n\nTaylor, of St. Christopher\u2019s Hospital, said that would require reaching parents and children at the same time. He said he now spends only about half of any given primary-care visit on medical issues; the rest is dedicated to addressing social issues. He writes twice as many prescriptions for things like emergency food, utilities assistance, after-school activities, and parenting programs as for medications.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a whole new paradigm of how to care for families in traumatized neighborhoods,\u201d said Taylor, who also is an associate professor at the Drexel University College of Medicine.\n\nAisha Johnson\u2019s hope is that these innovations can offer a brighter future for her children.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to say what effects might linger from her own childhood: her parents\u2019 separation when she was 7, and the years living in a neighborhood she feels is unsafe. She has chronic pain, and recently was diagnosed with lupus, an autoimmune disease linked to adverse childhood experiences.\n\nShe thinks the art therapy can help her sons - and maybe her as well. It\u2019s already made her household calmer. \u201cIt is a whole lot less conflict,\u201d she said.\n\nWhile stocking up on crayons, she bought a few coloring books for herself.\n\n\u201cMe and my husband sit down and color with them, too,\u201d she said. \u201cWe actually do it as a family.\u201d\n\n___\n\nOnline:\n\nhttp://bit.ly/22iDLpa\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Philadelphia Inquirer, http://www.inquirer.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "Leaning over their kitchen table, Xavier Johnson, 12, and his brother, DaShawn, 9, grinned shyly as they fanned out dozens of drawings in crayon, pencil, and marker.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Leaning over their kitchen table, Xavier Johnson, 12, and his brother, DaShawn, 9, grinned shyly as they fanned out dozens of drawings in crayon, pencil, and marker.", "title": "Art therapy as help for children raised in poverty, violence", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/dec/26/art-therapy-as-help-for-children-raised-in-poverty/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/12/26/exchange_art_therapy.jpeg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/12/26/exchange_art_therapy.jpeg", "description": "Leaning over their kitchen table, Xavier Johnson, 12, and his brother, DaShawn, 9, grinned shyly as they fanned out dozens of drawings in crayon, pencil, and marker.", "card": "summary", "title": "Art therapy as help for children raised in poverty, violence"}, "Author": "SAMANTHA MELAMED", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "She thinks the art therapy can help her sons - and maybe her as well.\nEven an hour a week of art therapy has made an impact, said Turley, who says she has noticed a reduction in bullying and disruptions.\n\u201cWhen I\u2019m mad, I draw my anger, and I just get happy.\u201dHe learned to do that through an art therapy program designed to provide critical coping skills for children growing up in tough circumstances.\nEdwards, a dance-movement therapist, said creative arts therapy can be effective when children might not be ready to address traumas head-on.\nThe art therapy program Xavier and DaShawn attend - run out of Drexel University\u2019s Stephen and Sandra Sheller 11th Street Family Health Services Center, through a collaboration with Spring Garden School, a neighborhood public school - is a response to that."}
