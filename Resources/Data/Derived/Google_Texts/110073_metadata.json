Jerry Brown is considering expanding state-funded Medi-Cal coverage to residents shielded from deportation under President Obama\u2019s new immigration policies.\n\nNancy McFadden, the governor\u2019s top policy aide, said that possibility is under review by the Brown administration, but implied that the potential cost would be a factor in the decision.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still evaluating, but the president\u2019s recent action on undocumented immigrants could perhaps open a door for more coverage of more people under Medi-Cal,\u2019\u2019 McFadden said. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at that. That, of course, is going to cost money.\u2019\u2019\n\nMcFadden made the comments while speaking at an event Wednesday hosted by the Public Policy Institute of California, held after the release of its recent opinion poll on California's future, and she touched on a number of Brown\u2019s top policy priorities for his upcoming new term.\n\nMcFadden noted that 2 million more Californians are covered by Medi-Cal than two years ago, and emphasized that the increase in healthcare coverage for residents is a pivotal ingredient in helping people rise out of poverty.\n\nThose gains in Medi-Cal enrollment coincided with the implementation of the Obama administration\u2019s Affordable Care Act. Undocumented residents currently cannot sign up for subsidized health insurance provided under the Affordable Care Act, and also are barred from Medicaid, the federal-state healthcare program for low-income Americans (known as Medi-Cal in California).\n\nMore than a million immigrants in California could benefit from protections provided by Obama\u2019s executive action.\n\nMcFadden, speaking to a packed conference room at the Sheraton Grand Hotel near the Capitol, said the governor's main focus during his next term would be to ensure that the major policies launched over the last four years are successful. That includes a push for more local control over schools and the criminal justice system, as well as Brown\u2019s emphasis on reducing carbon emissions.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not sexy \u2026. but we\u2019ve got to do the hard work of implementing,\u2019\u2019 McFadden said.\n\nAmong Brown\u2019s top priorities is constructing the state\u2019s $68-billion high-speed rail system, which has come under fire by Republicans in Congress and his GOP challenger in the November election.\n\nPublic support for the rail system has eroded since California voters in 2008 authorized $9 billion in borrowing for the project, some public opinion polls show. However, the governor believes the rail system will be essential to improving transportation and reducing carbon emissions in California, McFadden said.\n\nBrown wants to \u201cget high-speed rail actually on a path where it won\u2019t be stopped,\u2019\u2019 McFadden said.\n\nIn June, a budget compromise between the Democratic governor and the Democratic-controlled Legislature set aside a quarter of the revenue raised by California\u2019s state cap-and-trade program, which charges fees on polluters when their carbon emissions exceed set limits, to help fund the bullet train.\n\nOn tax policy, McFadden said that Brown would listen to ideas about retooling California\u2019s tax system, but that he would oppose any effort to extend the temporary tax increase voters approved in 2012 under Proposition 30. Brown campaigned heavily for the tax increase to help California recover from the recession.\n\n\u201cThe governor has been really clear that he went to voters and said Prop. 30 was a temporary tax increase, and he\u2019s not going to break faith with the voters on that,\u201d McFadden said.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Gov.
