In the beginning of the resurgence of the Australian film industry in the 70s and through to the 80s, she was right there.\n\n\u201cIt is a real loss to the Australian creative community and we are very grateful for all she did in the years she was with us.\u201d\n\nHughes, who was born in Melbourne in 1952, was a National Institute of Dramatic Art (NIDA) graduate and was well known for her work in film, television and theatre.\n\nHer TV acting credits included The Man From Snowy River, State Coroner, Homicide and Number 96 and Return To Eden. Hughes most recent TV appearance was on Miss Fisher\u2019s Murder Mysteries.\n\nShe won the Australian Film Institute (AFI) Award for best actor in 1983 for Careful, He Might Hear You.\n\nOn stage she appeared in productions for all the major theatre companies.\n\nHughes had a daughter, Charlotte, from her relationship with actor Chris Haywood, and a son, Jay, with restaurateur Patric Juillet.\n\nShe was briefly married to actor Sean Scully from 1971 to 1973.\n\nOne industry executive described Hughes as \u201cAustralia\u2019s first big movie star who translated TV success onto the big screen\u201d.\n\nShane Bourne, 64, met Hughes when they were both young actors in their early 20s and said she was part of the renaissance of Australian film in the 1970s.\n\n\u201cIt is a great loss,\u201d said Bourne. \u201cThe first I remember meeting Wendy was when I ended up at a party with some friends of mine and she was there.\n\n\u201cShe had such an amazing presence even then. She personified, even at a young age, the big personality of someone in show business, that I kind of aspired to myself. She was drinking, smoking laughing and singing and I never forgot that.\n\n\u201cOf course like every other male in Australia at the time, we were all in love with her, not only because of her looks but there was this earthiness that came through on screen.\u201d\n\nBourne worked with Hughes on a number of occasions, including on the MDA and City Homicide TV shows.\n\n\u201cI was kind of honoured to be in her presence,\u201d he said. \u201cWendy was just very professional and really easy to work with and self-deprecating at the same time.\n\n\u201cThe last time I saw her was in Melbourne in Albert Park and I looked up and saw Wendy come out in full period costume from the 1870s or something standing at the top of the stairs having a fag. It was a great look and one that I remember fondly.\u201d\n\nMichala Banas recalled working with Hughes as a fresh-faced young actor, appearing in an episode of State Coroner.\n\n\u201cWendy had such a strong presence about her and she forged an amazing career that I think any actor would have looked up to her,\u201d said Banas.\n\n\u201cI remember when I first met her I was intimidated because I was just 19 and a young actor and she was a big deal. She was really lovely though.\n\n\u201cAs soon as she said hello, I realised it was going to be OK and there was nothing to be scared of. My working experience with her was a great one and I\u2019m shocked to hear she has passed.\u201d\n\nKerry Armstrong worked alongside Hughes on numerous productions.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m absolutely devastated, I couldn\u2019t be more saddened, especially for her beautiful children,\u201d Armstrong said.\n\n\u201cShe was one of the most fiercely intelligent and unique actors that we\u2019ve ever seen, plus she had a cracker sense of humour as well.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "AUSTRALIAN actor Wendy Hughes has died at the age of 61.", "generator": "legacy", "og": {"site_name": "DailyTelegraph", "description": "AUSTRALIAN actor Wendy Hughes has died at the age of 61.", "title": "Australian actor Wendy Hughes has died at the age of 61", "url": "http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/australian-actor-wendy-hughes-has-died-at-the-age-of-61/story-fni0cx12-1226848998648", "image": "http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2014/03/08/1226848/998621-bac15fec-a688-11e3-900e-99186aa12c4d.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2014/03/08/1226848/998621-bac15fec-a688-11e3-900e-99186aa12c4d.jpg"}, "site": {"identifier": "@dailytelegraph", "id": "@dailytelegraph"}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "fb": {"admins": ",100000875899514", "app_id": 135086289853833}, "articleid": 1226848998648, "keywords": "young actor, acting credits, celebrated actor, Entertainment Writer, ,Snowy River,New South Wales,Australia, ,Sydney,New South Wales,Australia, ,Melbourne,Victoria,Australia, ,,,Australia, MDA, Wendy Hughes, Jay, Patric Juillet, Michala Banas, Australian film, fellow actor, standing ovation, died age, fresh-faced young actor, young actors, Australian film industry, theatre companies, cracker sense, industry executive, Australian actor, State Coroner, National Institute of Dramatic Art, News Front, Sean Scully, Chris Haywood, Shane Bourne, Kerry Armstrong", "article": {"publisher": "News Limited", "publicationdate": "Sat Mar 08 21:47:01 EST 2014", "modified_time": "Sat Mar 08 21:47:01 EST 2014", "author": "SydCon Staff"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf59f\"", "article_summary": "Australian actor Wendy Hughes has died at the age of 61AUSTRALIAN actor Wendy Hughes has died at the age of 61.\nShe won the Australian Film Institute (AFI) Award for best actor in 1983 for Careful, He Might Hear You.\nIn the beginning of the resurgence of the Australian film industry in the 70s and through to the 80s, she was right there.\n\u201cI can only say that she was a fantastic actor,\u201d Brown told The Sunday Telegraph, having worked with Hughes on several occasions, including on Newsfront.\nHughes had a daughter, Charlotte, from her relationship with actor Chris Haywood, and a son, Jay, with restaurateur Patric Juillet."}
