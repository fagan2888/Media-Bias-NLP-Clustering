Vivek Murthy, the 36-year-old nominee to become the next surgeon general, may have supported Barack Obama for president and agreed with his political views.\n\nDavid Weigel David Weigel is a reporter for the Washington Post.\n\nYou\u2019re still sitting, right? That\u2019s good. Murthy\u2019s done a downright terrible job of concealing his liberalism. Not long after his residency, the Yale-educated doctor and MBA co-chaired Doctors for Obama\u2014look, right there in the name!\u2014and campaigned to elect a Democratic president. After Obama took the White House, Doctors for Obama became Doctors for America, and Murthy promoted the Affordable Care Act. On his Twitter feed, Murthy chatted with organizers and boosted the Obama re-election campaign and even criticized the NRA.\n\nTired of politicians playing politics w/ guns, putting lives at risk b/c they're scared of NRA. Guns are a health care issue. #debatehealth --Vivek Murthy (@vivek_murthy) October 17, 2012\n\nThis tweet still haunts Murthy. As of last week, his nomination hangs in jeopardy because Senate Democrats\u2014who can afford to lose every Republican vote and four of their own\u2014aren\u2019t confident they can confirm him. Months after reforming the filibuster, after lowering the vote threshold from 60 to 51, Democrats are facing their second defeat of a nominee in less than a month. The most-stated reason is that in his tweets and in his work at DFA, Murthy couldn\u2019t help himself from criticizing guns as a \u201chealth care issue.\u201d In a post\u2013Sandy Hook letter, DFA even supported an assault weapons ban. He earned the ire of the National Rifle Association, and the NRA scared off the necessary rump of Democrats.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nEvery other Democrat, in Congress and in the White House, is baffled. They went into the confirmation vote for Justice Department nominee Debo Adegbile expecting to lose a few of their own\u2014Adegbile had joined a defense team for Mumia Abu-Jamal and criticized the role of race in the justice system\u2014but not to lose. Joe Biden didn\u2019t show up for the vote to lose. He expected to cast a tie-breaking aye. They didn\u2019t expect the NRA to oppose a nominee for surgeon general because, as one White house source put it, when has that ever happened?\n\nVivek Murthy earned the ire of the NRA, and the NRA scared off the necessary rump of Democrats.\n\nHere\u2019s the irony: By ending the filibuster, and by allowing the 55-seat Democratic caucus to confirm nominees with no Republican buy-in, the majority has complicated life for its red-state members. They can no longer expect a Republican filibuster to kill a \u201ccontroversial\u201d nomination. They have to kill the nominations themselves. That\u2019s a challenge, because the Murthy nomination went from yawn-inducing to Fox News A-block material faster than any of them noticed. Day by day:\n\nFeb. 4: Murthy appears before the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions. His opening statement makes no mention of the gun tweets (and why would it), and he rather cheekily describes Doctors for America as an organization designed to \u201cstrengthen dialogue between physicians, patients, and policymakers about pressing health matters.\u201d Tennessee Sen. Lamar Alexander calls him out on this.\n\n\u201cMuch of your credential, it seems to me, is a political credential,\u201d says Alexander. Murthy had advocated for the Affordable Care Act, when there was \u201cat least a large majority of Americans and a large number of the Congress who disagree with that law.\u201d He\u2019d tweeted critically of the NRA, when \u201cAmericans have a First Amendment right to advocate for the Second Amendment or any amendment.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nMurthy backs down immediately, saying his priority in office would be fighting obesity, not gun ownership. \u201cMy concerns with regard to issues like gun violence have to do with my experience as a physician,\u201d he says, \u201cseeing patients in emergency rooms.\u201d The issue seems to peter out. Wyoming Sen. Mike Enzi says he\u2019s \u201cglad\u201d Murthy walked back the gun talk, and adds that \u201cin the West, violence is mostly caused by people taking away guns.\u201d\n\nFeb. 10: The conservative press catches on. Emily Miller, a former Republican flack\u2013turned\u2013author/editor with a focus on gun rights, devotes her Washington Times column to the \u201crabidly anti-gun\u201d Murthy. The doctor, she warns, is a \u201cpolitical lackey\u201d who\u2019s opposed by at least one former surgeon general and whose \u201cTwitter timeline is chock full of his anti-firearm screed.\u201d\n\nFeb. 26: Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul sends Majority Leader Harry Reid a letter announcing his intention to put a hold on the Murthy nomination. \u201cIn his efforts to curtail Second Amendment rights, Dr. Murthy has continually referred to guns as a public health issue on par with heart disease and has diminished the role of mental health in gun violence,\u201d writes Paul. \u201cAs a physician, I am deeply concerned that he has advocated that doctors use their position of trust to ask patients, including minors, details about gun ownership in the home.\u201d\n\nReid\u2019s office hardly tries to suppress the chortle. \u201cAs the sun rises in the East,\u201d says Reid spokesman Adam Jentleson, \u201cSen. Paul has placed yet another hold on yet another qualified nominee.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nOn the same day, the NRA sends a letter to Reid and Kentucky Sen. Mitch McConnell officially opposing the nomination.\n\nFeb. 27: The HELP committee moves Murthy\u2019s nomination to the full Senate on a 12-9, party-line vote.\n\nMarch 5-6: Eight Democrats join every Senate Republican in voting down the nomination of Debo Adegbile. The next day, in an atypically dramatic speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference, Pennsylvania Sen. Pat Toomey tells the story of how conservatives built on the effort of the Fraternal Order of Police and took down Adegbile. Democrats who didn\u2019t join the GOP, like New Hampshire Sen. Jeanne Shaheen and North Carolina Sen. Kay Hagan, take press release mortar fire from Republicans and local press.\n\nMarch 11-12: At the start of the Senate\u2019s last week before a short recess, Fox News starts covering the Murthy nomination. \u201cDo you want a partisan physician?\u201d asks Elisabeth Hasselbeck, rhetorically. Megyn Kelly\u2019s prime-time show books Chris Cox, the NRA executive who wrote the no-Murthy letter, where he claims the nominee \u201cis hell-bent on treating a constitutional freedom like a disease.\u201d\n\nMarch 14: Toomey, the co-author of the 2013 gun control amendment that the NRA opposed, comes out against the Murthy nomination. \u201cDr. Murthy, as the president of a partisan political organization, has been an active promoter of Obamacare,\u201d he explains. \u201cDr. Murthy also has advocated for policies that would erode our important Second Amendment rights.\u201d Later that day, the New York Times runs ahead of the curve and reports that the Senate is \u201cbalking\u201d at a vote on Murthy, with \u201cas many as 10 Democrats\u201d refusing to vote aye.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.subheadline": "How killing the filibuster has actually made it harder for red-state Democrats to vote for their own.", "fb-share": "Why Democrats Are Running Scared From the NRA Over the Next Surgeon General", "sailthru.author": "David Weigel", "description": "Take a seat, please, and grapple with this shocking truth.
