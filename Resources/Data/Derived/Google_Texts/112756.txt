Many cities in America, and the metro, see economic value in tweaking suburban development models, making them more urban or walkable — multi-story or multi-use properties, built close to streets with sidewalks, on-street parking and bike lanes.

Windsor Heights is in a unique position. It is between downtown and the mall, along the interstate and also bike trails. With many of its buildings aging and heading toward re-development, it is the perfect place for building a more walkable suburb.

Colby Interests is attempting to re-zone and re-develop part of an old strip mall near 73rd Street and University Avenue ["Apple Valley demolition will displace retailers," Aug. 12]. But instead of a multi-use, well-massed building that would help set a new tone for the city and encourage more development and interest from entrepreneurs, they have proposed an Aldi grocery store — with typical massing, setbacks and parking.

Re-zoning this land would be a major misstep for a city with so much potential.
