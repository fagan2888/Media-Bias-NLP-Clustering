Trump has captivated a share of the tea party with a style of politics utterly alien to the Constitution. In the year of Trump, the right is experiencing a post-constitutional moment.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThis wouldn\u2019t have seemed possible a few years ago. In 2010, the newly arrived tea party produced a class of constitutional obsessives like Sens. Rand Paul and Mike Lee who were focused not just on what government shouldn\u2019t do, but on what it couldn\u2019t do and why.\n\nAfter the compassionate conservatism of George W. Bush and the earmark-happy excesses of congressional Republicans in the Bush years, the tea party rebaptized the GOP in the faith of limited government and constitutional constraints. If you weren\u2019t down with the 10th Amendment, you weren\u2019t down with the tea party. Glenn Beck earnestly explored the Founding Fathers with his audience. It was a time of first principles.\n\nRand Paul, who sells autographed copies of the Constitution, is a libertarian distillation of these concerns. He makes constitutional persnicketiness a high art. Obamacare, the National Security Agency surveillance program, the Violence Against Women Act, President Barack Obama\u2019s war in Libya and intervention in Syria are just a few things he considers unconstitutional (and don\u2019t even get him started on Obama\u2019s tax information treaties).\n\nPaul, by the way, is the guy who objected that closing down part of the Internet, as Trump has proposed, would be unconstitutional. Not that it seems to have made much of an impression on Trump or anyone else.\n\nTrump exists in a plane where there isn\u2019t a Congress or a Constitution. There are no trade-offs or limits. There is only his will and his team of experts who will figure out how to do whatever he wants to do, no matter how seemingly impossible.\n\nThe thought you can\u2019t do that never occurs to him. He would deport the American-born children of illegal immigrants. He has mused about shutting down mosques and creating a database of Muslims. He praised FDR\u2019s internment of Japanese-Americans in World War II.\n\nYou can be forgiven for thinking that in Trump\u2019s world, constitutional niceties\u2014indeed any constraints whatsoever\u2014are for losers. It\u2019s only strength that matters. It shouldn\u2019t be a surprise that he expresses admiration for Russian President Vladimir Putin, a \u201cpowerful leader\u201d who is \u201chighly respected within his own country and beyond.\u201d Trump\u2019s calls to steal Iraq\u2019s oil and kill the families of terrorists are in a Putinesque key.\n\nFor some on the right, clearly, the Constitution was an instrument rather than a principle. It was a means to stop Obama, and has been found lacking.\n\nTrump is a reaction to Obama\u2019s weakness but also to his exaggerated view of executive power. Trump rejects the former, but is comfortable taking up the latter. Whereas Obama has a cool contempt for his political opponents and for limits on his power, Trump has a burning contempt for them. The affect is different; the attitude is the same.\n\nWhat, after all, is the worst-case scenario for a President Trump\u2019s strongman tendencies? Could Trump defy the law as written and give Congress the back of his hand in order to impose a new immigration system more to his liking? Obama has already done it. A hallmark of Obama\u2019s governance has been to say that he lacks the power to act unilaterally on a given issue, and then do it anyway.\n\nProgressives have been perfectly willing to bless Obama\u2019s post-constitutional government. Trump\u2019s implicit promise is to respond in kind, and his supporters think it\u2019s about time.\n\nTrump transcends the usual fault lines on the right between fiscal and social conservatives, libertarians and hawks, or establishment and grass-roots conservatives. What he has done is to unmoor conservatism\u2019s populism from its traditional ideological commitments, including those to constitutionalism and limited government.\n\nA pure populism is inherently in tension with constitutional conservatism. The Constitution is a device for frustrating popular enthusiasms, as are federalism, checks and balances, and the rule of law. It\u2019s why impassioned factions usually have very little patience for them, and why they are so central to checking government and protecting individual rights.\n\nIf the right\u2019s devotion to them wanes, it will be a loss not only for conservatism, but for the American polity.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO Magazine", "description": "Donald Trump has captivated a share of the tea party with a style of politics utterly alien to the Constitution.", "title": "The Right's Post-Constitutional Moment", "url": "http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/12/donald-trump-constitution-opinion-213458", "image": "http://static.politico.com/27/1f/ae4e840f43fd879a158ff3a5dca5/201512122-donald-trump-podium-back-gty-1160.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politicomag", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politicomag"}, "description": "Donald Trump has captivated a share of the tea party with a style of politics utterly alien to the Constitution.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "In the year of Trump, the right is experiencing a post-constitutional moment.\nGetty Opinion The Right's Post-Constitutional MomentNo one will ever mistake Donald Trump for a student of James Madison.\nIf you weren\u2019t down with the 10th Amendment, you weren\u2019t down with the tea party.\nWhereas Obama has a cool contempt for his political opponents and for limits on his power, Trump has a burning contempt for them.\nIn 2010, the newly arrived tea party produced a class of constitutional obsessives like Sens."}
