We are a large social activism organization that advocates on behalf of issues including the environment, human rights, animal welfare, social justice, politics and more. We are seeking part-time interns who are interested in working on these important causes. Interns will improve their writing and research skills, while building a broad portfolio of online writing samples.



Interns are given broad discretion in choosing the causes they work on. The time commitment is flexible and work can be done from anywhere with an Internet connection. Applicants should have a strong interest in activism and possess good writing and Internet skills, but prior activism experience is not required.



Interns are compensated for their work, and graduates of the internship also receive a bonus and may be considered for future work.



To apply, please respond with a brief cover letter and writing sample (pasted into your email). Please also provide at least two specific examples of causes that you would take action to support.



To assist in our internal tracking, please place "891" in the subject line of your response.
