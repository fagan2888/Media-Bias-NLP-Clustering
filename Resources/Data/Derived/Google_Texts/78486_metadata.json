(USATSI)\n\nPresident Obama was in Las Vegas recently at the home of Las Vegas Sun owner Brian Greenspun. Obama was there for a fundraiser. In the process, he told a really great Derek Jeter story.\n\nApparently, Obama and Greenspun played golf with Jeter and The Captain took some dough off the most powerful man in the world.\n\n\u201cHe and Derek Jeter stole money from me at Shadow Creek,\u201d Obama said of Greenspun, referring to the course in North Las Vegas. \u201cIt was clearly a set up, because when we got to the practice range, he was shanking balls everywhere. I said, \u2018You play golf Derek?' And he said, \u2018I just started two weeks ago.'\u201d They gave Jeter 30 strokes, Obama said, but he realized that was a mistake as soon as they were on the first hole. Jeter crushed him, he said. \u201cWe had to take a picture of me handing Derek Jeter money at the end of the game. Despite that, Brian is a great friend.\u201d\n\nMaybe if Obama read more Eye on Golf he would have known Jeter has been working on his game.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The former Yankee shortstop sandbagged President Obama so, so hard.", "og": {"site_name": "CBSSports.com", "description": "The former Yankee shortstop sandbagged President Obama so, so hard.", "title": "President Obama says Derek Jeter 'stole money from me' in golf game", "url": "http://www.cbssports.com/golf/eye-on-golf/25280068/president-obama-says-derek-jeter-stole-money-from-me-in-golf-game", "image": "https://41.media.tumblr.com/259b3905128b3e22a127258043be790c/tumblr_ntnbqvoVkU1qem99po1_1280.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The former Yankee shortstop sandbagged President Obama so, so hard.", "title": "President Obama says Derek Jeter 'stole money from me' in golf game", "url": "http://www.cbssports.com/golf/eye-on-golf/25280068/president-obama-says-derek-jeter-stole-money-from-me-in-golf-game", "image": "https://41.media.tumblr.com/259b3905128b3e22a127258043be790c/tumblr_ntnbqvoVkU1qem99po1_1280.png", "creator": "@EyeOnGolf", "site": "@cbssports", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"app_id": 297742330311988, "pages": 25902406772}, "vr": {"content_id": 25280068, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "golf tickets, golf news, LPGA PGA golf news articles coverage notes previews scoring british open championship masters pga championship open ryder presidents cup", "googlebot": "NOODP"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWe had to take a picture of me handing Derek Jeter money at the end of the game.\n\u201cHe and Derek Jeter stole money from me at Shadow Creek,\u201d Obama said of Greenspun, referring to the course in North Las Vegas.\n(USATSI)President Obama was in Las Vegas recently at the home of Las Vegas Sun owner Brian Greenspun.\nIn the process, he told a really great Derek Jeter story.\nDerek Jeter's golf game is apparently pretty good."}
