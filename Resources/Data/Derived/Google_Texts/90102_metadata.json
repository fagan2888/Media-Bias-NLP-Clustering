Is there a cure for what ails Brooklyn health care?\n\nStephen Berger, Chairman of Odyssey Investment Partners, LLC was the keynote speaker at Thursday\u2019s \u201cCrain\u2019s Health Care Symposium: Curing Brooklyn's Health Care Crisis\u201d event at the Brooklyn Marriott, sponsored by Crain\u2019s New York Business.\n\nBerger served as the chair of the Brooklyn advisory panel of Gov. Andrew Cuomo\u2019s 2011 Medicaid Redesign Team, which was intended to improve the stability of Brooklyn\u2019s health care system. The Brooklyn Work Group\u2019s report called for more outpatient primary care clinics and fewer inpatient hospital beds, among other restructuring.\n\nHundreds attended the symposium, which brought together panels that included CEOs from four Brooklyn hospitals along with representatives from government and labor.\n\nThe cure for the borough\u2019s health care crisis is apparently not going to be easy.\n\nWhen asked what went wrong with the Brooklyn Work Group\u2019s original plan to shift SUNY Downstate\u2019s inpatient clinical activity to LICH, Berger said bluntly, \u201cIt turned out the plans were delusional. It didn\u2019t exist; the concept wasn\u2019t real . . . We assumed that SUNY\u2019s leadership understood what to do to make serious progress. They didn\u2019t, and he\u2019s gone.\u201d\n\nThe core issue in Brooklyn, according to Berger, is how to change the behavior of health care consumers so they will work with primary care physicians in a networked system, rather than depending on hospitals for their basic health care needs.\n\n\u201cConsumers are not stupid,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they go to the ER, they\u2019ll see a doctor. It may take five hours, but they believe they\u2019re getting the best medical care.\u201d The transition to a networked system won\u2019t take place overnight, he said, explaining that the infrastructure does not yet exist.\n\nBerger also talked up raising private capital for health care, a controversial concept backed by Gov. Cuomo, who has pushed for for-profit hospitals in New York. \u201cNew York is different from the rest of the country, but different isn\u2019t necessarily better. The rest of the country mixes private and public dollars to deliver health care,\u201d he said.\n\nBerger also noted that \u201cthe rate structure must be redesigned,\u201d saying that the Affordable Care Act \u201cwill generate incentive payments.\u201d\n\nMembers of the morning's first panel included Dr. Neil Calman, President & CEO, The Institute for Family Health, Mount Sinai; Jill Furillo, Executive Director, NYS Nurses Association; James Introne, Former Deputy Secretary for Health, New York State; and Ngozi Moses, Executive Director, Brooklyn Perinatal Network Inc.\n\nA fragmented system\n\nWhile panel members agreed the days of \u201chospital-centric healthcare\u201d are numbered, most said that the integrated systems of the future were not yet available, and that current resources must stay in place until they are.\n\n\u201cWe do not have a system, we have parts of a system, a fragmented array of services,\u201d said Ngozi Moses. She said a health care needs-assessment was carried out by the Brooklyn Hospital Center and the I M Foundation, \u201cbut it\u2019s sitting on a shelf somewhere.\u201d Leadership is not coming from the Governor\u2019s office, she complained, \u201cand I\u2019ve heard that our elected officials do not have access.\u201d\n\nMoses noted that hospital closures always happen \u201cin poor communities,\u201d and pointed out that \u201cover 17 clinics closed in our community when two hospitals closed. Over 20,000 people were dislocated from five clinics, and couldn\u2019t even find their records.\u201d\n\nMost panelists seemed to agree that Brooklyn \u201cdoesn\u2019t want a state authority redesigning Brooklyn\u2019s health care.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt has to come from the community,\u201d said James Introne. Brooklyn\u2019s health care system must start with \u201ca healthy dialog not imposed by an external authority,\u201d he said.\n\nIntrone also discussed the limitations surrounding the Medicaid budget. \u201cIf we increase one part, we have to decrease another.\u201d\n\nJill Furillo pushed back against the notion that hospitals could be closed without affecting the surrounding neighborhoods. \u201cCommunities are being left behind. When you close a hospital you close 20 percent of community-based clinics.\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cNew York City is the inequality capital of the world. The Upper East Side has five times more primary care providers than Brooklyn. There are also lower reimbursement rates in Brooklyn than on the Upper East Side.\u201d Given Brooklyn\u2019s greater poverty, she called for the state to intervene in this inequality.\n\nFurillo strongly disagreed with Berger\u2019s stance on private equity. \u201cThe people who crushed our economy should not be running our health care,\u201d she declared, eliciting applause in the western quadrant of the ballroom.\n\nFinancing can make or break the managed care model\n\nFinancing was a big issue for Dr. Neil Calman, who said it requires capital to build a robust primary care system, and complained that the state hasn\u2019t yet committed to a reimbursement rate. \u201cAmbulatory care providers live on the edge of default. While community hospitals are overpaid for high cost procedures, they pay less than cost for Medicaid procedures.\u201d\n\nWhile many extol the move to the managed care model, Calman said, \u201cWe couldn\u2019t survive on what managed care pays us if the state didn\u2019t make up the difference, as a Federally Qualified health care provider. That gap is equal to $50 \u2013 $70 per visit that the state is picking up in a fee-for-service Medicaid environment.\" Hospitals are paid more for hi-tech procedures, high acuity patients, and commercially insured patients, he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a dream to move the public into the managed care model,\u201d he asserted.\n\nCalman also said that the system needed to be restructured. \u201cKids get out of school at 3:30, but we close at 5.\u201d He suggested \u201cco-locating\u201d primary care, mental health care and dental care facilities. \u201cThey\u2019re the same people.\u201d\n\nCalman was asked if Mt. Sinai planned to \u201crepurpose\u201d a hospital in Brooklyn \u2013 LICH, for example. \u201cI\u2019m not saying where,\u201d he said. [More from Dr. Calmen in comments below.]\n\nWhat is labor\u2019s relationship with mayoral frontrunner Bill de Blasio, Furillo was asked. \u201cWe have been working with de Blasio,\u201d she said. \u201cHe has redefined the role of the Public Advocate in advocating to restructure Brooklyn\u2019s health care. He has spoken about forming a Brooklyn co-operative and equalizing reimbursement rates. De Blasio is trying to bring together and build a primary system of care associated with acute care facilities,\u201d she said.\n\nWhen asked about the importance of job preservation to the New York State Nurses Association, Furillo said that NYSNA\u2019s role in Brooklyn \u201cgoes to the heart of the mission of nursing. We advocate for patients at all times, in the hospital and in communities.\u201d\n\n\"Should Interfaith close?\" James Introne was asked. He said the state \u201cis not in the business of closing or opening hospitals. We respond to boards and other providers.\u201d Gov. Cuomo, however, decided to close Interfaith \u201cbased on his lack of faith in its management,\u201d Introns said. While continuing some health services in the area \u201crepurposing the building is the ideal solution. \u201d Intron said he saw replacing boards \u201cas a last resort.\u201d\n\nThe CEO panel\n\nThe hospital CEO panel included Alan Aviles, President & CEO, New York Health and Hospitals Corporation; Dr. Richard B. Becker, President & CEO, The Brooklyn Hospital Center; Ramon J. Rodriguez, President & CEO, Wyckoff Heights Medical Center; and Dr. John F. Williams, President, SUNY Downstate Medical Center.\n\nAlan Aviles said he agreed with much of the Berger plan, \u201cbut the assumption is that a public hospital will be an anchor of the overall plan. There\u2019s little appreciation of how endangered HHC is. We\u2019ve reduced our work force and still have a structural deficit of hundreds of millions of dollars. If the Medicaid waiver doesn\u2019t come through, there will be a much worse crisis.\u201d\n\n\u201cHHC is prepared to be part of the process, but we do need leadership from the state,\u201d Aviles said, adding that Kings County had formed a relationship with University Hospital of Brooklyn (UHB). \u201cWe have the ability to increase capacity,\u201d he said. \u201cTwo units are mothballed. We just need capital.\u201d\n\nHard choices at SUNY Downstate\n\nDr. John Williams emphasized that SUNY Downstate is not just a hospital, \u201cbut a university with five schools.\u201d He said that SUNY itself had to come up with some sort of governing structure. \u201cWe worked together to rationalize our services.\u201d\n\nWith University Hospital of Brooklyn (UHB) facilities crumbling, Williams discussed the possibility of shifting UHB\u2019s operations to Kings County Hospital, across the street. \u201cIt could take 10 years to satisfy the student side, the resident side and the faculty side of five schools,\u201d he said. \u201cWe would have to shift $60 \u2013 70 million in research.\u201d\n\nAs an alternative, Williams said he has considered building a new hospital. \u201cIt would cost from $1 \u2013 1.5 billion,\u201d he said, roughly \u201cone million dollars per bed.\u201d\n\nBesides being deeply in the red, SUNY Downstate is mired in a thicket of lawsuits over its ill-fated attempts to close LICH, further complicating its financial position.\n\nDr. Richard B. Becker said the revenue and cost side both must be addressed. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to make a profit from delivering primary care in a modern, patient-centered way. You need access to capital to build, and need to be self-sustaining.\u201d Due to the changes in the health care law, however, Dr. Becker expects The Brooklyn Hospital Center \u201cto lose $70 million in revenue over the next eight years \u2013 \u201cAnd we\u2019re one of the more profitable hospitals in Brooklyn.\u201d\n\nOne roadblock to cooperation with a \u201cBrooklyn Healthcare Network\u201d proposed by Downstate (distinct from a borough-wide healthcare model proposed by Public Advocate Bill de Blasio) is the notion that \u201cno one wants to give up\u201d the high-paying services.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t generate profit from low-equity care, especially out in the community,\u201d Becker said. \u201cThe state should be more helpful in helping us fund this transition,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need access to capital.\u201d\n\nRamon J. Rodriguez described how Wyckoff Heights Medical Center \u201cshed $15 million in operating costs, and increased revenue and, by working with unions, increased productivity. \u201cWyckoff is a success,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, patients see smiling faces. Two years ago they saw bugs. Wyckoff is rising by responding to the needs of its neighbors.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe private capital thing is a diversion,\u201d he claimed. \u201cWe pay $12 million a year at 7 percent interest on a loan from the state. If we paid 4 percent interest,\" we wouldn\u2019t need private capital, he said.\n\nRodriguez cautioned against mergers between fragile partners. Wyckoff\u2019s 2006 merger \u201cwith two other places was a huge mistake,\u201d he added. \u201cWe almost lost the whole place.\u201d\n\nHe also emphasized hospitals must not be closed before opening alternative facilities. \u201cYou don\u2019t close the bridge from Rockland County to Westchester before opening a new one.\u201d\n\nRodriguez drew applause when he declared, \u201cI\u2019d like to have the state show up at this thing today!\u201d\n\nWhen Aviles was asked if The Brooklyn Hospital Center could tackle the changes discussed at the symposium without funding, he flatly replied, \u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe health care reform train has left the station,\u201d he said. \u201cDo we get there through chaotic collateral damage or thoughtful community planning with the unions as partners?\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://www.brooklyneagle.com/sites/default/files/b_crains_health_MFrost_crowd_2013.jpg"}, "twitter": {"widgets": {"csp": "on"}}, "description": "Two major Brooklyn hospitals \u2013 Long Island College Hospital and Interfaith Medical Center -- are fighting to stay open and several others are teetering.
