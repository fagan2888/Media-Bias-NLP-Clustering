Mitt Romney signed the law during a Faneuil Hall ceremony, calling it a big step forward in health care reform. At Romney\u2019s side were Democratic leaders including the late U.S. Sen. Edward Kennedy, who championed universal health insurance on a national level.\n\nState officials say the law that included subsidies for low-income residents to purchase insurance has led to near-universal coverage in Massachusetts. But the state has continued to struggle with rising health care costs.\n\nRepublican Gov. Charlie Baker said he planned to mark the anniversary on Tuesday by thanking those who \u201ccreated a legacy that spread way beyond Massachusetts.\u201d\n\nCopyright 2016 The Associated Press.
