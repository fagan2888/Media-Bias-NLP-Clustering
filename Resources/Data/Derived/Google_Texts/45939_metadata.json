However, the bill itself includes protections for net neutrality with specific language that would ban the paid \u201cInternet fast lanes\u201d currently at the center of the debate.\n\nBut not everyone is happy with that solution, and President Obama recently made a push for the FCC to go the reclassification route. He also wants the agency to overturn state laws that prevent cities and towns from creating their own broadband networks, and the bill would seemingly strip the FCC of the powers of Internet oversight that it needs to do that, as well.\n\nIt\u2019s also worrying that the bill has protections for current net neutrality concerns, but anything not expressly forbidden by the language of the bill would be out of the FCC\u2019s hands to field as a complaint. That could cause problems in the future if new issues arise and lawmakers are slow to address them.\n\nStill, it\u2019s surprising at this point to see a bill come from GOP members of congress that actually addresses the main concerns of ISPs prioritizing Internet traffic and stifling the innovation of smaller entities who can\u2019t pay up. This is more along the lines of what we would\u2019ve expected:\n\n\u201cNet Neutrality\u201d is Obamacare for the Internet; the Internet should not operate at the speed of government. \u2014 Senator Ted Cruz (@SenTedCruz) November 10, 2014\n\nThe bill still has a long way to go and may never make it into law, but you can read its relatively short text for yourself if you\u2019re not sure how you feel about it:\n\nNet Neutrality legislation\n\n(via Tech Crunch and Wall Street Journal)\n\nAre you following The Mary Sue on Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr, Pinterest, & Google +?", "article_metadata": {"description": "Congress has its own solution for net neutrality if this bill ever makes it into law.", "generator": "WordPress 2016.21", "og": {"image": "http://static02.mediaite.com/themarysue/uploads/2015/01/Bill-Schoolhouse-rock-640x449.jpg", "title": "Here\u2019s Congress\u2019s Net Neutrality Bill That Would Render the FCC Helpless"}, "twitter": {"description": "Congress has produced a bill that, if enacted, would take away the FCC's authority to reclassify broadband Internet as a utility in the interest of net neutrality.
