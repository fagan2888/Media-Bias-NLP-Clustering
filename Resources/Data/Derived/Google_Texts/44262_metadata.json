Weaver of Adams confirmed that she and her husband, William, have agreements with Rex Energy.\n\nOn the school board since 1991, Weaver said she could be impartial in deciding any lease of oil and gas rights for the school district.\n\n\u201cYou need to be able to learn how to separate yourself,\u201d Weaver said of her time on the board.\n\nBoard member John Kennedy also has an agreement with Rex Energy, according to records in the Butler County Recorder of Deeds Office.\n\nHe could not be reached for comment.\n\nThe proposed five-year school lease promises the district about $4,000 an acre for drilling rights about a mile underneath nearly 175 acres of school property.\n\nRex Energy said it will pay the district just over $1 million, which includes about $330,000 in advance royalties, for the rights to drill from a site about 4,000 feet from district property.\n\nThe district would receive 15 percent of royalties.\n\nBoard member Gordon Marburger of Adams said he's had a lease agreement with XTO Energy for nearly eight years, receiving 7 percent of revenues from a well pad in Forward, adjacent to his property.\n\nHe said he's hoping to earn from $7,000 to $15,000 annually from natural-gas drilling.\n\nMarburger said that his lease wouldn't affect his vote on the school lease proposal.\n\nHe declined to say if he'd approve or reject the lease.\n\n\u201cPut it this way. No matter which way we lean, you're going to have some people say it's harmful,\u201d Marburger said.\n\n\u201cBut if you vote it down, then you'll have people saying, \u2018Hey, you left this money on the table.' \u201d\n\nAttorney H. William White III, who is advising the school board on the lease proposal, said the fact that some board members have an oil or gas lease \u201cdoes not in and of itself create a conflict\u201d as long as their own leases aren't contingent on the district approving a lease.\n\nWhite added that residents concerned about the influence on board members of personal agreements with Rex Energy \u201chave a valid point.\u201d\n\nHe said he expected that those school directors who have personal agreements \u201cwill take individual actions\u201d at Tuesday's meetings.\n\n\u201cI think I'm still objective,\u201d Marburger said.\n\n\u201cThis well is going in whether we're part of it or not. The school is not the factor for this well being drilled.\u201d\n\nWhile Sean Fields, deputy general counsel of the Pennsylvania School Board Association, wouldn't talk specifically about the Mars board members, he held the same opinion as White.\n\n\u201cIn general, is there an economic benefit to the director? If there's a preexisting lease, it's unlikely there's a conflict,\u201d Fields said.\n\nMars is not the only public body in the county that has looked at subsurface drilling as a source of revenue.\n\nThe Butler Area and Seneca Valley school districts have signed agreements with Rex, while the South Butler School District has an agreement with XTO Energy, according to district officials.\n\nOn Monday, Butler Township approved a lease with XTO Energy for drilling underneath two township parks.\n\nButler City officials are promoting and marketing drilling under the 90-acre Memorial Park.\n\nBill Vidonic is a staff writer for Trib Total Media.
