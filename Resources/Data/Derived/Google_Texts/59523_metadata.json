The Chicago Cubs released Brothers on Thursday, choosing to pay a $232,000 termination fee after initially giving the left-handed reliever a $1.42 million contract.\n\nThe theory \u2014 espoused by fans, as well as some major-league scouts I\u2019ve talked to \u2014 states that the Rockies tinkered with Brothers\u2019 mechanics so much that he lost direction on the mound. His natural feel for pitching got lost in a jumble of directives from upper management and pitching coaches.\n\nGiven the Rockies\u2019 poor track record in developing homegrown pitching, it seems like a plausible theory. But it\u2019s not that simple and it\u2019s not really true.\n\nBrothers\u2019 decline was more about injury, and what an injury can do to a pitcher\u2019s psyche. It\u2019s a shame, how- ever, that the Rockies were unable to fix Brothers, a supplemental first-round draft choice in 2009 and one of the hardest workers to ever wear a Rockies uniform.\n\nIn 2013, Brothers was one of the best lefty relievers in baseball. Aggressive and fearless on the mound, he posted a 1.74 ERA and notched 19 saves in 21 chances when he took over as the closer in the second half of the season. He was penciled in as Colorado\u2019s future closer, but he struggled in 2014, his ERA skyrocketing to 5.58. His mechanics were clearly off, either bouncing pitches in front of the plate or leaving grapefruits hanging over the plate.\n\nBrothers spent much of the 2015 season with Triple-A Albuquerque, searching for his command. He never quite found it, but his velocity returned, his fastball occasionally touching 97 mph.\n\nStill, Rockies general manager Jeff Bridich ran out of patience. In November, Brothers was designated for assignment and a few days later was traded to the Cubs for minor-league lefty Wander Cabrera.\n\nEven in 2013 when Brothers was at his best and his strikeout rate was 10.2 per nine innings, he walked too many batters, averaging 4.8 walks. So, yes, the Rockies did adjust his mechanics, but not to the extent that it ruined him as a pitcher.\n\nI\u2019ve asked Brothers \u2014 on and off the record \u2014 if he thinks the Rockies messed him up. He has consistently told me that was simply not the case. He admitted he had some shoulder issues that he tried to work through and it affected him more than he anticipated.\n\n\u201cI got to a spot where I was laboring a little bit physically, had a couple of bad outings and started searching for the success I had,\u201d Brothers told me in November when the Rockies designated him for assignment. \u201cI think I got away from the athleticism that helped my success. I got away from that aggressiveness.\n\n\u201cBut that was not because of a pitching coach or anybody else. Looking back on it, I think I backed myself into a corner and I had to start back from square one. I think, now, I\u2019ve got that competitive fire back. I think I was showing that again this past season.\u201d\n\nNow, clearly, Brothers is still searching. Pitching in three Cactus League games for the Cubs, he allowed three runs over 2 \u2154 innings for a 10.13 ERA. Worst of all, he threw four wild pitches in one inning against the Arizona Diamondbacks last Sunday.\n\nI asked Rockies manager Walt Weiss if he thought Brothers\u2019 problems were mechanical or physical.\n\n\u201cProbably a mixture of both,\u201d Weiss answered. \u201cIt\u2019s a little perplexing.\u201d\n\nThen I asked Weiss whether Brothers was tinkered with too much.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so. I don\u2019t think that was the case,\u201d Weiss said.\n\nThe bottom line: Brothers is not the pitcher he was, but at age 28 he still has a chance to resurrect his career.\n\nPatrick Saunders: psaunders @denverpost.com or @psaundersdp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Saunders: Are Rockies to blame for Rex Brothers\u2019 struggles on mound?", "title": "Saunders: Are Rockies to blame for Rex Brothers\u2019 struggles on mound?", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/03/12/saunders-are-rockies-to-blame-for-rex-brothers-struggles-on-mound/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-03-12T18:12:28+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-23T02:24:58+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Patrick Saunders"}, "article_summary": "I\u2019ve asked Brothers \u2014 on and off the record \u2014 if he thinks the Rockies messed him up.\nThe theory \u2014 espoused by fans, as well as some major-league scouts I\u2019ve talked to \u2014 states that the Rockies tinkered with Brothers\u2019 mechanics so much that he lost direction on the mound.\nI asked Rockies manager Walt Weiss if he thought Brothers\u2019 problems were mechanical or physical.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a little perplexing.\u201dThen I asked Weiss whether Brothers was tinkered with too much.\nSCOTTSDALE, Ariz. \u2014 The Rockies ruined Rex Brothers."}
