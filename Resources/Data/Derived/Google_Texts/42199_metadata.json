The monthly cost is increasing an average 26 percent for UnitedHealthcare\u2019s AARP MedicareRx Saver Plus while the First Health Value Plus plan is dropping an average 13 percent, according to an analysis of the 10 most popular drug plans by Avalere Health, a research firm.\n\nSome actual costs may be even more dramatic. In Albany, N.Y., the price of a Cigna-HealthSpring drug plan is going up 36 percent, according to the StateWide Senior Action Council, a New York consumer group.\n\n\u201cConsumers should view open enrollments as the ultimate in consumer empowerment,\u201d said Andy Slavitt, acting administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which oversees the private insurance plans. \u201cAs Medicare consumers shop for what\u2019s right for them, that causes benefits, quality and premiums to continue to improve.\u201d\n\nBut most beneficiaries opt to stay put, rather than endure what can be a frustrating enrollment experience.\n\nSo in addition to reviewing Medicare\u2019s online ratings of the plans, consumer may want to consider these shopping tips to make the process easier.\n\nAre your drugs covered and at what price?\n\nUse Medicare\u2019s \u201cplan finder\u201d website at medicare.gov/find-a-plan to pinpoint the drug plans in your area that include your medicines on their formularies. Since these lists of covered drugs can change every year, make sure your drugs are still covered before renewing a policy.\n\nAlso make sure that the plan covers your drug as your doctor prescribed it. Some plans allow a 30-day, 90-day or monthly supply, but if your prescription is for a different frequency \u2014 for example, an inhaler every two months \u2014 you can be charged the plan\u2019s full cost of the drug. Some plans require that you try a different medication first.\n\nCall the insurance company to confirm the details before signing up.\n\nThe full price of a drug can vary from plan to plan, and your share of the cost can also vary. More plans are charging members a percentage of the price, or co-insurance, instead of a flat amount or co-payment, said Tricia Neuman, director of the Kaiser Family Foundation\u2019s Medicare policy program. (KHN is an editorially independent program of the foundation.)\n\nWill you pay one price for the same prescription all year?\n\nNo. Medicare\u2019s drug coverage has different stages. First, you pay the plan\u2019s full price for drugs until you\u2019ve paid the deductible of $360 for 2016, a $40 increase over this year. Not all plans require the full deductible, but next year 53 percent will, according to the KFF analysis.\n\nThen when you and the plan have paid $3,310, you will reach a coverage gap \u2014 also called the \u201cdoughnut hole\u201d \u2013 and you will pay 45 percent of the plan price for brand name drugs and 58 percent for generics. After you\u2019ve spent $4,850, you enter another stage and pay either $2.95 for generic drugs and $7.40 for other drugs, or 5 percent, whichever is greater, until the end of the year.\n\nDepending on your income, you may be eligible for a subsidy to help pay for your drugs.\n\nIs your pharmacy in the plan\u2019s network?\n\nThe drug price also depends on whether the pharmacy you use is in the plan\u2019s provider network. Nearly all plans also designate \u201cpreferred\u201d pharmacies, which offer lower costs than others in the network. You\u2019ll pay the full price at pharmacies outside the network.\n\nMost plans also have a mail-order option, but don\u2019t assume it is cheaper. \u201cMail order pharmacies can even be more expensive than your local walk-in pharmacy,\u201d said Margaret Murphy, associate director at the Center for Medicare Advocacy.\n\nWhat is the monthly premium?\n\nMany consumers judge a plan\u2019s cost by its monthly fee or premium, one of its largest and most consistent expenses. But the premiums \u201ccan be dwarfed very quickly\u201d by a what a beneficiary spends on drugs, said Colin Shannon, a senior manager at Avalere Health. \u201cThere are all sorts of drugs out there that will cost a lot more than the premiums.\u201d\n\nIf you are also considering a Medicare Advantage plan that provides both drug and medical coverage, first, check the plan finder for plans in your area that cover your drugs. But there are also other things to weigh.\n\nMedicare Advantage must cover the same medical benefits as traditional Medicare, but most have at least one important difference: they dropped Medicare\u2019s requirement of a three-day hospital admission in order to receive nursing home coverage.\n\nMany Advantage plans also add extras, such as dental services, eye care and gym discounts. But unlike traditional Medicare, these private plans restrict beneficiaries to a network of health care providers. Even though insurers can drop providers from their networks during the year, beneficiaries are not allowed to switch plan for that reason.\n\nAre my doctors and hospital in the plan\u2019s network?\n\nAlthough Medicare Advantage plans have to follow federal rules ensuring they have enough health care providers, federal investigators found officials rarely check , and starting next year, the agency is requiring plans to update online provider directories \u201cin real time.\u201d Before signing up, double check with your doctors to see if they accept your specific plan.\n\nFor more help:\n\n\u2022 Medicare\u2019s 24/7 information line: 1-800-633-4227\n\n\u2022 State Health Insurance Assistance Programs (SHIPs) offer free independent, individual insurance counseling for Medicare beneficiaries and their caregivers.
