The first service at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church since nine people were killed during a Bible service is continuing with enthusiastic songs, music and clapping.

Church bells are ringing throughout Charleston in remembrance of nine people who were slain during a Bible study in what has been called a racially motivated attack.

The ringing bells were part of a loosely organized movement to honor the victims Sunday. To some, Charleston is known as the “Holy City” because of the numerous churches throughout downtown.

As the bells rang, people at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church held their first worship service since the massacre.

Authorities say 21-year-old Dylann Roof opened fire during the Bible study on Wednesday night. Slain were Emanuel’s pastor, as well as others involved in the community and church.
