It also killed 3,500 birds in the first year of its operation (the Desert Sun):\n\nMore than 3,500 birds died during the 377-megawatt Ivanpah solar project\u2019s first year of operation, a new report estimates. Bird deaths were known at the \u201cpower tower\u201d project, which is located in San Bernardino County off Interstate 15 just southwest of the Nevada border. But how many was unclear. Even at the 3,504 estimate, the report considers the deaths a \u201cminimal proportion of local, regional, or national populations\u201d of birds. Ivanpah, the world\u2019s largest concentrated solar project, uses thousands of mirrors that direct sunlight at boilers on top of three 459-foot tall towers, heating a liquid to create steam used to run a turbine. Carlsbad-based NRG Energy operates the Ivanpah project, which it co-owns with Google and Oakland-based BrightSource Energy. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service previously called Ivanpah \u2014 the world\u2019s largest concentrated solar project \u2014 a \u201cmega-trap\u201d for birds and insects, although the exact number of deaths has been a subject of fiery debate.\n\nAn executive with Abengoa\u2013one of the project\u2019s developers\u2013said the bid death problem is \u201csolvable.\u201d\n\nBirds are killed when they fly through the towers, which can reach 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit, according to a Wall Street Journal article published in February of 2014. At the time, the publication noted that regulators knew some birds would die, but didn\u2019t expect the dozens of avian deaths during the project\u2019s construction and testing phase. They\u2019re reaching the conclusion of their two-year study on the solar farm\u2019s effects on birds.\n\nNevertheless, this isn\u2019t an isolated incident. A solar panel farm in Nevada was frying birds flying through the facility. In one test, engineers and biologists noticed trails of smoke emanating from burning birds.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Fried birds .05/26/2016 4:17:41AM EST.", "author": "Matt Vespa", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Fried birds", "title": "Matt Vespa - Extra Crispy?
