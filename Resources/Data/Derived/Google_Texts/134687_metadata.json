So have people who work full-time and are earning a living wage, who don\u2019t qualify for Medi-Cal, but can receive subsidies based on their income as a percentage of the federal poverty line.\n\nIn an interview on CBS News, the CEO of Covered California, the state\u2019s health insurance exchange, praised the face-to-face model, especially for Latinos.\n\n\u201c(Latinos) are much more apt to sign up in person sitting across the table from someone,\u201d CEO Peter Lee said, rather than by phone or online.\n\nCovered California launched a campaign specifically targeted at enrolling Latinos, who make up about half of the state\u2019s uninsured.\n\nAs of October, Pasadena\u2019s Director of Public Health Dr. Eric Walsh said there were about 25,000 city residents who were uninsured.\n\nSince CHAP Care\u2019s enrollers became certified in November, it alone has enrolled about 600 people at its health centers and enrollment events.\n\nThose who enroll through the shop do not have to plan to choose CHAP Care as a provider, Abramson said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCHAP Care plans to keep the shop open beyond the March 31 enrollment deadline, Abramson said, and may open other shops throughout the city.\n\nAbramson said for the next five years, the organization will be focused on enrolling people who now qualify for health insurance coverage.\n\n\u201cThe point is people don\u2019t have to figure this out on their own and if they do, they\u2019re going to get frustrated and they probably can\u2019t,\u201d Abramson said.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s health insurance exchange has four tiers and six plan options in each tier for people to choose from.\n\nThe exchange\u2019s website suffered technical difficulties this week with an unplanned system outage, which put a stop to enrollments.\n\nThe shop is located at 316 E. Colorado Blvd. Hours are Monday through Saturday 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. and Sunday 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. Help is available in English, Spanish and Mandarin.\n\nCall 626-486-9729 to make an appointment. Walk-ins are also accepted.\n\nPeople can also visit www.mycoverla.com to see if they are eligible for coverage.", "article_metadata": {"description": "PASADENA >> Nestled among clothing and jewelry stores and restaurants is a unique kind of shop on Colorado Boulevard at the Paseo Colorado where you won\u2019t walk out with a shopping bag.
