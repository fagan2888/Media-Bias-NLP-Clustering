More celebration is in store for the national champion Denver Pioneers men’s lacrosse team.

The team is going to be honored during halftime of Friday’s Denver Outlaws game against the Ohio Machine at Sports Authority Field at Mile High.

It will be an added bonus for NCAA tournament most outstanding player Wesley Berg, who will be making his debut with the Outlaws that night.

The game is set to start at 7 p.m. Fans who want to take a picture with the Outlaws’ Steinfeld Trophy or the Pioneers’ NCAA Championship trophy can visit section 105 in the first quarter and the first half of the second.
