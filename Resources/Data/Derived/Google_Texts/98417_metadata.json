Jindal criticized the Obama administration, liberal elites, the HHS Mandate, and the infringement experienced by such businesses as Elane Photography, a business facing civil fines for refusing to photograph a same-sex commitment ceremony. It\u2019s a welcome exception to the sight of national leaders increasingly unwilling to address religious liberty for fear of pushback by liberal interest groups.\n\nJindal delivered some hard-hitting one-liners aimed at the Obama administration and liberal elites. A few highlights of the lines designed for maximum impact:\n\n\u201cIt is unmistakable that most of the Obama Administration\u2019s attacks on religious liberty are aimed at conservative Christians.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur religious liberty must in no way ever be linked to the ever-changing opinions of the public.\u201d\n\n\u201cMake no mistake: the war over religious liberty is the war over free speech, and without the first there is no such thing as the second.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe government doesn\u2019t get to decide who can preach the gospel.\u201d\n\nJindal urged national and state lawmakers to be vigilant against attacks on religious liberty and to pass legislation that protects the conscience of America\u2019s faithful citizens\u0097regardless of creed.\n\nJindal finished his remarks drawing attention to the remarks of President Obama at the National Prayer Breakfast. The President\u2019s remarks were well received, according to most, but bordered on myopic and contradictory by others because of the policies emanating from the White House, such as the HHS Mandate. According to Jindal,\n\nLast Thursday, exactly one week ago, something truly bizarre occurred.\n\n\n\nThe person who is at the tip of the spear prosecuting this quiet war on religious liberty spoke at the annual National Prayer Breakfast in Washington. The topic he chose to speak about was defending religious liberty.\n\n\n\nI was stunned, and I bet the President of Hobby Lobby, who was in the audience, was stunned as well. Yes, President Obama did wax eloquent, as he always does, about the horrors of religious persecution that are occurring beyond our borders. And good for him.\n\n\n\nTo be clear, churches in America are not being burned to the ground, and Christians are not being slaughtered for their faith. There is really no comparison to the persecution of people of faith inside our borders and outside.\n\n\n\nYet, it is stunning to hear the President talk of protecting religious liberty outside the United States, while at the very same time his Administration challenges and chips away at our religious liberty right here at home. Once again, there is a Grand Canyon sized difference between what this President says and what he does.\n\n\n\nHere is what the President said last week, no doubt playing to his audience: \u201cHistory shows that nations that uphold the rights of their people \u0097 including the freedom of religion \u0097 are ultimately more just and more peaceful and more successful.\u201d Well said Mr. President, I couldn\u2019t agree more.\n\n\n\nSo I leave you with this \u0097 the President is very concerned about religious liberty . . . and also, if you like your religion you can keep your religion.\n\nNo one is quite sure of Jindal\u2019s 2016 intentions, but his speech was likely an attempt at connecting with the concerns of America\u2019s Christian population. Other politicians would do well to take note.\n\nEven accepting that politics were involved, Jindal also spoke with obvious conviction. He went places in his speech that most politicians won\u2019t dare to touch, and for that, he deserves the appreciation for all conservative Christians who feel that their government and their culture are leaving them behind\u0097and doing so with hubris and mockery. Sometimes, it\u2019s necessary for politicians to take the gloves off and deliver an eye-popping rebuke to the Powers That Be. Jindal did just that.
