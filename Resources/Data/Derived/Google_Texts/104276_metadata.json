Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), Ed Markey (D-Mass.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Ben Cardon (D-Md.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Jack Reed (D-R.I.) and Barbara Mikulski (D-Md.).\n\n\u201cWe know that when an incident happens off the coast of one state, it affects the entire region, as we saw in Louisiana, Texas, Alabama, Mississippi, Florida, all from one oil spill accident in the Gulf,\u201d Booker said.\n\n\u201cAnd so, the thought of opening up the Atlantic Ocean to this drilling puts an immediate threat to the Atlantic Coast as a whole,\u201d he said.\n\nTheir bill, called the Clean Ocean and Safety Tourism (COAST) Anti-Drilling Act, mirrors legislation introduced Monday \u2014 the fifth anniversary of the Deepwater Horizon explosion that kicked off an 87-day oil spill \u2014 by Rep. Frank Pallone (D-N.J.).\n\nThe legislation is a direct response to Interior\u2019s proposal, released in January, to conduct one lease sale in the Atlantic at some point between 2017 and 2022.\n\n\u201cThe administration has, in effect, prompted this legislation by issuing its plan,\u201d Blumenthal said.\n\n\u201cThe administration rationalizes this decision, saying it was about balance. But the cost of this balance falls inappropriately on our environmental values.\u201d\n\nMenendez said he hopes that introducing the bill would spur the Obama administration to discuss the plan with Senate Democrats and reconsider Atlantic drilling.\n\n\u201cI hope the administration changes course, and I think hearing a collective voice here of a lot of senators were very key assignments on different committees that can make the very crystal clear to the administration changes their course as we move forward,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2014 This story was updated at 7:31 p.m.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Six Senate Democrats from the Northeast are taking on the Obama administration with a bill to prevent offshore oil and natural gas drilling on the Atlantic Coast.", "description": "Six Senate Democrats from the Northeast are taking on the Obama administration with a bill to prevent offshore oil and natural gas drilling on the Atlantic Coast.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Timothy Cama", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Six Senate Democrats from the Northeast are taking on the Obama administration with a bill to prevent offshore oil and natural gas drilling on the Atlantic Coast.", "title": "Senate Dems take on Obama on Atlantic drilling", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/239722-senate-dems-take-on-obama-on-atlantic-drilling", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-04-22T19:36:24-04:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2015-04-22T19:36-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/239722-senate-dems-take-on-obama-on-atlantic-drilling", "dcterms.date": "2015-04-22T14:01-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Timothy Cama", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "oil, Natural gas, Offshore drilling,Bob Menendez, Cory Booker, Richard Blumethal,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-22T14:01:22-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-22T19:36:24-04:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/239722-senate-dems-take-on-obama-on-atlantic-drilling", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Six Senate Democrats from the Northeast are taking on the Obama administration with a bill to prevent offshore oil and natural gas drilling on the Atlantic Coast.", "card": "summary", "title": "Senate Dems take on Obama on Atlantic drilling"}, "dcterms.title": "Senate Dems take on Obama on Atlantic drilling"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe07fe\"", "article_summary": "Six Senate Democrats from the Northeast are taking on the Obama administration with a bill to prevent offshore oil and natural gas drilling on the Atlantic Coast.\n\u201cAnd so, the thought of opening up the Atlantic Ocean to this drilling puts an immediate threat to the Atlantic Coast as a whole,\u201d he said.\nADVERTISEMENT\u201cFive years later, Big Oil wants to bring Deepwater Horizon to the Atlantic,\u201d Sen.(D-N.J.) told reporters Wednesday.\nBut the cost of this balance falls inappropriately on our environmental values.\u201dMenendez said he hopes that introducing the bill would spur the Obama administration to discuss the plan with Senate Democrats and reconsider Atlantic drilling.\nThe legislation is a direct response to Interior\u2019s proposal, released in January, to conduct one lease sale in the Atlantic at some point between 2017 and 2022."}
