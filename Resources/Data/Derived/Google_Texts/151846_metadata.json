In 2012, the paper endorsed Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman for the Republican presidential nomination, and picked Arizona Sen. John McCain in 2000 and 2008.\n\nAt around the same time Monday evening, the Boston Heraldendorsed Chris Christie for the Republican nomination. The New Jersey governor \u2014 also running in the Republican primary\u2019s \u201csanity bracket,\u2019\u2019 as the Globe puts it \u2014 was also endorsed by New Hampshire\u2019s largest paper, the conservative-leaning Union Leader, in November.\n\nKasich was also recently endorsed by a pack of New Hampshire papers, including the Nashua Telegraph, Foster\u2019s Daily Democrat, and the Portsmouth Herald. Like Christie, the Ohio governor has been focusing his campaign\u2019s efforts on New Hampshire.\n\nRead the Globe\u2019s full endorsement here.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-wide310x150logo": "https://www.boston.com/wp-content/themes/bdc/images/favicons/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "A day after it endorsed Hillary Clinton in the Democratic primary, The Boston Globe editorial board gave its blessing to John Kasich for the Republican nomination.
