Some people had called or e-mailed repeatedly while trying to enroll, and each person could have generated several problem tickets.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know what that means in terms of people,\u201d Drews said.\n\nPart of the problem is that the system is having trouble dealing with each family\u2019s complicated circumstances.\n\n\u201cTo say I\u2019m disappointed is an understatement,\u201d said board member Nathan Wilkes, founder and principal consultant of Headstorms Inc.\n\n\u201cIt confounds me. How did we build a system that couldn\u2019t handle changes like this,\u201d Wilkes said. \u201cI\u2019d like to understand how we got here.\u201d\n\nStaff indicated it\u2019s likely not the technology vendors\u2019 fault the system hasn\u2019t worked smoothly. Implementation manager Adele Work said it appeared contractor CGI wasn\u2019t given a full list of system requirements. A full review is planned.\n\nLast year was the first year for state health insurance exchanges under the Affordable Care Act, and some Coloradans enrolling through the marketplace experienced bumps and delays. This year, Connect for Health officials promised a more user-friendly and streamlined website \u2014 offering one portal for consumers to determine if they were eligible for Medicaid or for tax credits toward private insurance. Yet issues multiplied.\n\nThe exchange already had paid about $6 million for its part of the upgrade, with state Medicaid officials overseeing development of the new interface between programs. Drews said the exchange didn\u2019t know how much it ultimately would cost to clean up the enrollment process.\n\nThe exchange, funded by federal grants, private grants and program revenues such as fees charged insurance carriers, must become financially self-sustaining as the grants run out, but continuing large outlays for technology could threaten that. About $41 million was budgeted for technology in 2014. And the 2015 technology budget for maintenance, support and upgrades is $28 million.\n\nOpen enrollment for 2015 health plans, which began Nov. 15, has seen more than 121,000 individuals sign up for medical and/or dental plans. Of those, about 63,000 were automatic renewals and didn\u2019t require active enrollment. Others actively shopped before enrolling in different plans or re-enrolling in their existing plans.\n\nAbout 23,000 people are new customers. The problems were concentrated among those seeking financial assistance \u2014 either through tax credits available on the exchange or through Medicaid eligibility. They account for a little more than half of enrollees.\n\nMore than 20 system features or glitches prevented many applicants from completing the process.\n\n\u201cWe do need to get people moved through the system right now,\u201d Drews said in asking for the $322,000. He said it wouldn\u2019t provide the long-term system fixes needed, but it would provide a workaround for those currently stuck.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t appear we have a choice. This is about service to members,\u201d said board member Eric Grossman, chief executive of NextHealth Technologies.\n\nBoard member and state insurance commissioner Marguerite Salazar said the enrollment deadline of Feb. 15 was bearing down.\n\n\u201cThere are real people out there who are very afraid they are not going to have coverage when enrollment is over,\u201d Salazar said.\n\nWork said staff focus hasn\u2019t been on assessing blame, but on getting people enrolled.\n\nDr. Mike Fallon, with the North Colorado Medical Center, said the questions weren\u2019t about assigning fault.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not blame,\u201d Fallon said. \u201cIt\u2019s: \u2018Let\u2019s get what we paid for.\u2019 We paid somebody to do this.\u201d\n\nWork disagreed it likely was a contractor failure.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a vendor problem. It\u2019s a specificity of requirements problem,\u201d Work said. \u201cOur (specified) requirements weren\u2019t enough to build the interface (between Medicaid and the state\u2019s insurance exchange).\u201d\n\nElecta Draper: 303-954-1276, edraper@denverpost.com or twitter.com/electadraper", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Colorado health exchange approves $322,000 to fix enrollment problems", "title": "Colorado health exchange approves $322,000 to fix enrollment problems", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/01/12/colorado-health-exchange-approves-322000-to-fix-enrollment-problems/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141103_082136_Connect-for-Health-Colorado-Screengrab-9.jpg", "height": 432}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141103_082136_Connect-for-Health-Colorado-Screengrab-9.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-01-12T12:27:08+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T03:59:29+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The Connect for Health Colorado board of directors agreed to spend an additional $322,000 through the end of February to try to sign up applicants stalled in the state health insurance exchange\u2019s online enrollment system.\nLast year was the first year for state health insurance exchanges under the Affordable Care Act, and some Coloradans enrolling through the marketplace experienced bumps and delays.\nBoard member and state insurance commissioner Marguerite Salazar said the enrollment deadline of Feb. 15 was bearing down.\nThe exchange already had paid about $6 million for its part of the upgrade, with state Medicaid officials overseeing development of the new interface between programs.\nThe problems were concentrated among those seeking financial assistance \u2014 either through tax credits available on the exchange or through Medicaid eligibility."}
