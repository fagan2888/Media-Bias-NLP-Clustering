companies remain profitable in the China market, but increasing local competition and rising costs are pressuring profit margins, according to a new survey.\n\nThe U.S.-China Business Council (USCBC) said Monday that nearly 50 percent of survey respondents reported double-digit revenue expansion \u2014 fewer than in prior years, but still strong results compared with other global markets.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThe China market continues to deliver important revenue opportunities for American companies, even as GDP growth moderates,\u201d said USCBC President John Frisbie.\n\nThe central concern around the increasing competition from China's domestic industry resides in the preferential treatment received by Chinese state-owned enterprises.\n\n\"The survey data shows again that nationality trumps ownership, Chinese companies, whether state-owned or private, receive benefits that foreign companies do not,\" the report said.\n\nMeanwhile, the optimism of U.S. firms doing business in China is being tempered by policy uncertainty on intellectual property protections and enforcement of new antitrust laws that appear to focus more on foreign competitors.\n\n\"While both foreign and domestic companies are being investigated, foreign companies appear to be facing increasing scrutiny,\" Frisbie said.\n\nAll told, 86 percent of survey respondents are concerned about the lack of transparency, due process and other issues surrounding competition-related investigations.\n\nU.S. firms say they continue to limit their operations and intellectual property exposure in China because of the lack of protections while little progress is being made on much-needed policy changes.\n\nOverall, companies have seen few tangible effects so far from China\u2019s economic reforms and report little improvement in any of the top 10 issues over the past year, which is holding back any plans to expand.\n\nHalf of the companies plan to boost resources in China in the next 12 months, down from almost 75 percent three years ago.\n\nAlso, retaining good workers is being complicated by China\u2019s environmental pollution with 40 percent of companies reporting that air pollution has made it difficult to retain or assign expatriate staff to China.\n\nPollution has also increased the use of sick leave among those workers.\n\nThe business environment survey provides an annual assessment and lists the top 10 challenges faced by U.S. companies operating in China.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The majority of U.S.
