The debate and speculation is based on whether different types of orgasms are attained from vaginal penetration and clitoral stimulation. Now, according to a study in the Journal of Sexual Medicine, ultrasounds have found women do experience not one, but two kinds of orgasms \u2014 clitoral and vaginal \u2014 that differ in blood flow and sensations.\n\n\u201cWomen describe at least two types of orgasms: clitoral and vaginal. However, the differences, if any, are a matter of controversy,\u201d wrote the study authors. Through the use of ultrasounds, the researchers believe, they would be able to capture the visualizing movements of the clitorourethrovaginal (CUV) complex \u2014 the system of clitoral nerves \u2014 during both external and direct stimulation of the clitoris, and during vaginal stimulation. This procedure would be able to clarify the \u201cfunctional anatomy of this sexual pleasure.\u201d\n\nTwo French gynecologists, Odile Buisson and Emmanuele A. Jannini, used an ultrasound to track blood flow patterns and to determine how the clitoris moves during different types of sex with three healthy volunteers. These women were asked to stimulate themselves during manual self-stimulation of the external clitoris and during vaginal penetration with a wet tampon. A flat probe and vaginal one were used to carry out functional sonography scans. Both probes measured the tiny changes in blood flow patterns in the area during different types of sexual contact to determine how the clitoral and vaginal complex responded.\n\nThe findings revealed during external clitoral stimulation the orgasm did not involve the internal root of the clitoris. However, during vaginal stimulation, due to the movements and displacements, both the root and the external clitoris were involved. The researchers found this difference affected blood flow and therefore led to a difference in sensation.\n\nThis shows \u201cfunctional differences depending on the type of stimulation,\u201d the researchers explained, the Daily Mail reported. Furthermore, \u201cthe [Doppler] signal indicating flow speed in the veins mirrored these anatomical changes.\u201d Overall, Buisson and Jannini believe the different reported perceptions of these two kinds of stimulation could be explained by the different parts of the clitoris \u2014 external and internal \u2014 and the CUV complex involved.\n\nThis study adheres to Sigmund Freud\u2019s belief who devised the two-orgasm theory. He believed the vaginal orgasm was a feminine and mature sexual response, while the clitoral orgasm was masculine, immature, and inferior. However, Dr. Alfred Kinsey has refuted Freud\u2019s claims through interviews where he found women could not and were not having vaginal orgasms, according to several studies available via The Kinsey Institute. Despite the recent findings of the French study, many will wonder if the vaginal orgasm really does exist.\n\nWhether a woman has a vaginal or clitoral orgasm, her body will physically react in the same way. Everyday Health says a woman\u2019s heart rate, blood pressure, and breathing increase as she feels stimulation in her clitoris, and tension within her pelvis is released upon the orgasm. Partners should learn about the different types of orgasms, as one in three women have trouble achieving an orgasm when having sex, while 80 percent have difficulty orgasming with just vaginal intercourse alone.\n\nSource: Buisson O and Jannini EA.
