On Sunday afternoon, the Amarillo Thunderheads scored five runs in the bottom of the fifth inning, taking the final game of the series from Sioux Falls by a final of 12-7 at Potter County Memorial Stadium.\n\n\n\nThe Canaries scored first in the top of the second when Jason Repko scurried home on a wild pitch. Amarillo picked up two runs in the bottom of the third after Dexter Kjerstad hit a towering two-run homerun over the left field wall. The Birds\u2019 answered with a run in the top half of the fourth after veteran Jason Repko hit a solo shot deep into the Amarillo sky.\n\nAmarillo did most of their damage in the bottom of the fifth thanks to a three-run homerun by Kjerstad, picking up his second homer of the contest. Stefan Gartrell followed with a two-run blast over the right field wall. Both teams picked up a run in the sixth inning, bringing the score to 8-3 in favor of Amarillo.\n\n\n\nThe final run for the Birds\u2019 came in the top of the seventh after Chris Grayson singled in newcomer Brett Balkin. Amarillo did pick up four runs late in the game off an error by third baseman RJ Perucki, a wild pitch from Mike Watt and a double from Rene Leveret.\n\n\n\nSioux Falls made things interesting after Brett Balkin doubled in a run followed by an RBI single from Chris Grayson. The Canaries picked up their final run of the ballgame after Balkin scored on a wild pitch.\n\n\n\nBrian Humphries and Jason Repko each paced the Canaries offense, going 2-for-4 with a homerun and an RBI.\n\nSioux Falls starting pitcher Stephen Bougher was knocked out of the game early after going four innings, allowing six earned runs on ten hits.\n\n\n\nThe Canaries head back to Sioux Falls for two much needed days off before returning to action on July 29. Sioux Falls will welcome the Kansas City T-Bones to the Birdcage for a three game series. First pitch is scheduled for 7:05 PM on Wednesday as the Canaries try to break the attendance record of 5,482.\n\n\n\nFans can catch all the action home and away on AM 1230 and FM 98.1 Sioux Falls Sports Network KWSN, as the \u201cVoice of the Canaries\u201d JJ Hartigan will bring all the latest news related to Canaries baseball.\n\n- Jerrett Mills\n\nNews\n\nNon-Homepage {{Title}} Remove Change News General Courts Web Only Crime Outdoors Events Center Non-Homepage Boredom Busters Pipeline Positively KELOLAND Technology Hunger Affordable Care Act Shops Flooding Remembering 9/11 Drought JazzFest Spring Storm Honor Flight Spencer Anniversary\n\nDoApp Health News Business News Sports\n\nAgriculture Markets Livestock Crops Politics\n\nHealthBeat Cancer Children's Health Heart Health Wellness & Nutrition General Health Beat Women's Health RX Resources What's Going Around OTC Diabetes Recalls Dental Health Men's Health\n\nPolitics South Dakota Legislature Budget Congress Taxes General Local Campaign President US Senate New Laws US House Iowa Ballot Issues Local Races Minnesota Gubernatorial\n\nEducation Funding College Elementary High School Pre K School Supplies Middle School\n\nSports Professional College High School Sports Zone Headlines Summit League Tournament Olympics\n\nBusiness Industry Your Money Matters Development Gas & Energy Legislation Economy/Stocks Employment General Health Care Technology Education Funding Tourism Banking/Finance Housing Transportation Insurance Meetings & Events Retail & Restaurants All Industries On The Move Shops Agriculture\n\nFeatured Stories Eye on KELOLAND Inside KELOLAND\n\nWeather Snow Forecast Records Rain Flooding Drought WX Corner General\n\nWorld News\n\nInvestigates GEAR UP\n\nSponsored Done\n\n\u00a9 2016 KELOLAND TV.
