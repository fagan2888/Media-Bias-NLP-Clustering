I\u2019m not alone. There are some 20 million college grads living at home. A 2014 study reported by CNN Money found that half of kids who are two years out of college rely on their parents to pay some or all of their bills. It\u2019s the new normal for 20-somethings.\n\nGee, parents sure are getting a great financial return on the $150,000 they\u2019ve shelled out for four years of college.\n\nSure, some of this dependency is an entitlement mentality of millennials whose parents have given them almost everything they\u2019ve ever wanted. But it also reflects how dismal the economy still is today. Today we have college grads \u2014 along with working moms and 60-somethings \u2014 flipping burgers at Wendy\u2019s and stocking the aisles at Wal-Mart. Left-wing groups and union leaders are now demanding \u201ca living wage\u201d for jobs that were never intended to be for heads of households. Who\u2019s against higher wages for American workers? But wasn\u2019t this what Obamanomics was supposed to deliver?\n\nSeven years ago, Barack Obama promised a progressive worker paradise \u2014 a recovery from recession that would leave no one behind. \u201cHope and change\u201d would deliver high employment and rising wages, and no one bought into this idyllic vision more than college kids.\n\nPresident Obama and his supporters proclaim that he has saved America from the second great depression \u2014 a message we will start to hear again over and over in the months ahead. But even his own voters don\u2019t believe him anymore, now that we\u2019re just ending the seventh summer of no real recovery.\n\nStart with the jobless rate. Yes, unemployment is down to 5.1 percent officially. Raise your hand if you believe that number is even close to accurate. The real unemployment rate counting labor force quitters and those forced into part-time jobs is, according to Mr. Obama\u2019s own Labor Department: 10.5 percent. That number is actually down from more than 15 percent recently, but these still feel like recession rates. Nearly 90 million Americans over the age of 16 are out of the full-time workforce, and many millions of them are plopped in front of the TV watching \u201cSeinfeld\u201d reruns and living off food stamps or their parents because they have given up looking for a good job.\n\nIf we had experienced a normal recovery from recession, we\u2019d have roughly 5 million to 6 million more of these Americans working today. With a Reagan-style recovery, more than 8 million Americans would be working and collecting a paycheck.\n\nThe more than 100 million Americans who are working are feeling a financial crunch, too. Most of them haven\u2019t seen a pay raise that keeps pace with inflation for a decade.\n\nThe Census Bureau has released the latest data on family income, and it has been analyzed by the statisticians at Sentier Research. Through this past June, the median income family has lost $1,700 in real income since Team Obama took the reins (see chart).\n\nThe sad irony is that the steepest declines in income have been suffered by blacks, Hispanics, single women and, of course, those stay-at-home millennials. Oddly enough, these are the Obama voters. They also tend to be concentrated on the lower rungs of the economic ladder. Imagine the scathing indignation and the cries of racism and sexism if this were the record of an incumbent Republican president rather than a liberal Democrat. Call it Mr. Obama\u2019s \u201cwar on women.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s yet another bitter irony of this president\u2019s labor policies. Mr. Obama obsesses over income inequality \u2014 almost as fanatically as he does climate change. But the standard measure of income inequality \u2014 the so-called Gini Coefficient \u2014 shows a wider gap between rich and poor than during the George W. Bush years. Using his own metrics, Obamanomics is a dismal failure.\n\nThe progressives think that the best way to drive up wages is to smack down businesses as greedy, self-serving and corrupt. But you need an employer before you can have an employee. Sorry, to be anti-business and pro-labor is like being anti-chicken and pro-egg. When Hillary Rodham Clinton said earlier this year that \u201cbusinesses don\u2019t create jobs,\u201d she didn\u2019t misspeak, she was expressing a profound ignorance of how the private sector hiring machine works. Donald Trump said it well: As a businessman, \u201cif I have more money, I can hire more workers.\u201d\n\nThe employment recession didn\u2019t start with Mr. Obama but with George W. Bush. Voters are distrustful of both parties and justifiably so. Even the simplest reforms \u2014 like building pipelines, cutting the corporate tax rate, letting banks lend money to businesses and homebuyers, or requiring work for able-bodied welfare recipients \u2014 don\u2019t get done. But this past week, the president was up in the Arctic lecturing us about climate change. The unemployed probably feel that if he relishes cold weather so much, he should stay there.\n\nFor all of these reasons, this year, Labor Day should be renamed Labor Pains Day.\n\n\u2022 Stephen Moore is a Fox News contributor and an economics consultant to Freedom Works.", "article_metadata": {"description": "My 22-year-old son lives at home, still depends on his old man for spending money, and my profoundest fear is that like Will Ferrell in the \"Wedding Crashers,\" he will never leave the nest.
