What it is ain\u2019t exactly clear.\n\nHere\u2019s Bill Clinton in Spokane, Wash., making the pitch for his wife last week: \u201cBut if you believe we can all rise together, if you believe we\u2019ve finally come to the point where we can put the awful legacy of the last eight years behind us and the seven years before that . . . \u201d\n\nThe awful legacy of the last eight years? That\u2019d be a strange thing for any Democrat to say, but it\u2019s particularly odd given that Hillary Clinton has made it abundantly clear that she\u2019s running for a third Barack Obama term.\n\nLast year, she loved telling voters that she wasn\u2019t running as a continuation of Obama. But that was before Bernie Sanders ignited a left-wing populist backlash against the status quo. Unable to get to Sanders\u2019s left \u2014 understandable, given that it would require embracing Bolshevism \u2014 Clinton was forced to defend the administration she worked for.\n\nAlso, as has been widely reported and dissected, Clinton\u2019s strategists concluded months ago that she had no choice but to embrace Obama and his policies, because Obama is popular with precisely the voters Clinton needs in order to assemble a winning coalition. These voters may think the country is on the wrong track, but they don\u2019t blame Obama for it.\n\nThat\u2019s one reason why Team Clinton has charged, sometimes hysterically, that Sanders is somehow attacking the president when he says, for instance, that Obamacare doesn\u2019t go far enough. The Clintonistas touted the fact that Sanders blurbed a book by left-wing writer Bill Press critical of Obama as if it were a confession of treason.\n\nBut now comes the former president attacking the Obama record head-on. The Spokane speech wasn\u2019t a fluke. Bill has also taken to explaining that the real reason this election is so crazy is that \u201c80 percent of the American people haven\u2019t gotten a pay raise since the crash.\u201d\n\nNo doubt he wouldn\u2019t put all the blame on Obama, but that\u2019s some odd messaging for a campaign looking to run on \u201cfour more years.\u201d\n\nOne obvious explanation is that the Clinton team has come to grips with the fact that the Sanders and Trump insurgencies are two faces of the same larger phenomenon. Huge swaths of the American electorate are fed up, ticked off, and wildly disappointed with the direction of their country.\n\nIn a society so polarized along ideological lines, it\u2019s no surprise that partisans will have partisan explanations for why this is so. But the underlying conditions driving the discontent are in fact bipartisan. Anyone who listened closely to both the tea parties and the Occupy Wall Street crowd could hear the echoes of similar complaints. The incestuous relationship between big business and big government drives both the Left and the Right crazy.\n\nAs a conservative, I think the right-wingers have better remedies for the problem. In a nutshell, big corporations will always have the resources \u2014 financial, political, legal, etc. \u2014 to manipulate and navigate around regulations. Smaller firms simply can\u2019t handle the compliance costs of draconian regulations.\n\nThe result: Only the really big companies can survive and thrive, which in turn makes them \u201ctoo big to fail.\u201d That\u2019s why community banks are being destroyed by Obama\u2019s policies: They can\u2019t carry the costs the way the big banks can, and, lacking connections and influence, they\u2019re small enough to fail.\n\nIn other words, if you think Big Business and Big Government are hugging each other too much, the last thing you should do is have government tighten the embrace.\n\nBut that\u2019s a policy argument for another day. And besides, the underlying problems with the economy are much larger than, and in some cases wholly unrelated to, Wall Street excesses.\n\nBut as a political matter, Wall Street is a useful scapegoat. And the Clintons, both darlings of Wall Street who have enriched themselves by exploiting their connections to it, are badly positioned to withstand, never mind exploit, the populist tide. That\u2019s why Hillary Clinton can\u2019t put Bernie Sanders away. That\u2019s why Bill is turning up the heat on the \u201cawful legacy\u201d of the last eight years. And that\u2019s another reason Hillary will have a harder time in the fall than people think.\n\n\u00a9 2016 Tribune Content Agency", "article_metadata": {"description": "With apologies to Buffalo Springfield, there\u2019s something happening here.
