As a result, insurance companies as they are now will be going away,\u201d Emanuel wrote.\n\nIn the op-ed, the brother of Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel detailed that accountable care organizations will compete in the health care exchanges and also seek contracts with employers.\n\n\u201cThese new organizations are delivery systems with networks of physicians and hospitals that provide comprehensive care. This health delivery structure is in its infancy,\u201d Emanuel stated. \u201cToday there are hundreds of these organizations being created and gaining experience within government-sponsored programs or getting contracts from private insurers.\u201d\n\nEmanuel predicts that hospital systems and accountable care organizations will become \u201cintegrated delivery systems\u201d like insurance companies.\n\n\u201c[T]hey will cut out the insurance company middle man \u2013 and keep the insurance company profits for themselves,\u201d Emanuel said. \u201cTherefore, increasingly these ACOs and hospital systems will transform themselves into integrated delivery systems, entering insurance exchanges and negotiating with employers, in direct competition with insurance companies.\u201d\n\nLast month, Emanuel said these ACOs will replace insurance companies by 2025. He also said he believes that more hospitals will close.\n\n\u201cHospitals are a grossly inefficient way of providing jobs,\u201d he told a Princeton University lecture hall, according to The Daily Princetonian. \u201cWe don\u2019t need 5,000 hospitals.\u201d\n\nAccording to The Hill, the White House has implemented another Obamacare delay, allowing health insurers to continue offering plans that were originally canceled due to the law.", "article_metadata": {"description": "One of the architects behind President Barack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act believes that \u201cinsurance companies as we know them are about to die.\u201d", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://washington.cbslocal.com/2014/03/04/obamacare-architect-insurance-companies-as-we-know-them-are-about-to-die/", "image": {"width": 1500, "secure_url": "https://cbswashington.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/453041979-11.jpg?w=1500", "identifier": "https://cbswashington.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/453041979-11.jpg?w=1500", "height": 1064}, "type": "article", "description": "One of the architects behind President Barack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act believes that \u201cinsurance companies as we know them are about to die.\u201d", "title": "Obamacare Architect: 'Insurance Companies As We Know Them Are About To Die'"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://cbswashington.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/453041979-11.jpg?w=1500", "description": "One of the architects behind President Barack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act believes that \u201cinsurance companies as we know them are about to die.\u201d", "site": "/cbsdc", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Obamacare Architect: 'Insurance Companies As We Know Them Are About To Die'"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "News, Sports, Weather, Traffic and the Best of Washington DC", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "CBS DC", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cbsdc", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/cbsdc"}, "keywords": "cbs washington, politics, affordable care act, ezekiel emanuel, obamacare, president barack obama", "google-site-verification": "44caXBf4kjHeKKAT7ZZ89NaCX25utL_yRSa-qGpwIhY", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://washington.cbslocal.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/b87f6ea5e510fe3d34ffe9a8dbe8c1cf?s=16", "news_keywords": "affordable care act, ezekiel emanuel, obamacare, president barack obama"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1579\"", "article_summary": "As a result, insurance companies as they are now will be going away,\u201d Emanuel wrote.\n\u201cTherefore, increasingly these ACOs and hospital systems will transform themselves into integrated delivery systems, entering insurance exchanges and negotiating with employers, in direct competition with insurance companies.\u201dLast month, Emanuel said these ACOs will replace insurance companies by 2025.\n\u201c[T]hey will cut out the insurance company middle man \u2013 and keep the insurance company profits for themselves,\u201d Emanuel said.\n\u201cThese new organizations are delivery systems with networks of physicians and hospitals that provide comprehensive care.\n\u201cToday there are hundreds of these organizations being created and gaining experience within government-sponsored programs or getting contracts from private insurers.\u201dEmanuel predicts that hospital systems and accountable care organizations will become \u201cintegrated delivery systems\u201d like insurance companies."}
