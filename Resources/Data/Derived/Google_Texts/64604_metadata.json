But the best he could coax out of the former Secretary of State and First Lady was that speculation on her candidacy had turned into a \u201ccottage industry.\u201d\n\nClinton\u2019s appearance on The Daily Show comes near the end of a book tour that has taken her across the U.S., to Europe and to the studios of most major American television networks for extended interviews. It is a return performance for Clinton, who first appeared on Stewart\u2019s Comedy Central show when she was a Senator for New York promoting her 2003 memoir, Living History. She also made an appearance during her 2008 presidential campaign.\n\nDuring Tuesday\u2019s show, Clinton touched on several of the domestic and international issues she tackled as Secretary of State, topics that are the backbone of her latest book, Hard Choices, which currently occupies the No. 2 slot on the New York Times\u2019 nonfiction best-seller list.\n\nStewart called the book an \u201ceyewitness view to the history of those four years,\u201d but repeatedly came back to the question of 2016. \u201cI think I speak for everybody when I say, no one cares (about the book), they just want to know if you\u2019re running for President.\u201d\n\nOn that point, however, Clinton intends to keep feeding that cottage industry.\n\nWatch the extended interview with Clinton below.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The former Secretary of State dodged The Daily Show host's persistent quizzing about her intentions to run for president in 2016", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "The former Secretary of State dodges The Daily Show host's persistent quizzing about her presidential intentions", "title": "Hillary Clinton Gives Daily Show\u2019s Jon Stewart No Clues on 2016 Candidacy", "url": "http://time.com/2990265/hillary-clinton-2016-election-candidacy-daily-show-jon-stewart/", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/ap887428589898.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/ap887428589898.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012"}, "description": "The former Secretary of State dodges The Daily Show host's persistent quizzing about her presidential intentions", "site": "TIME", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Hillary Clinton Gives Daily Show\u2019s Jon Stewart No Clues on 2016 Candidacy"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "keywords": "daily show, hillary clinton, jon stewart, presidential election, 2016", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/time"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Daily Show, Hillary Clinton, Jon Stewart, presidential election, 2016"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd478\"", "article_summary": "\u201cShe\u2019s here solely for one reason: to publicly and definitively declare her candidacy for President of the United States,\u201d Stewart said jokingly when introducing Clinton.\nStewart called the book an \u201ceyewitness view to the history of those four years,\u201d but repeatedly came back to the question of 2016.\n+ READ ARTICLEHillary Clinton\u2019s Tuesday appearance on The Daily Show failed to provide any clarity on whether she will run for President, despite host Jon Stewart\u2019s best attempts.\nWatch the extended interview with Clinton below.\nIt is a return performance for Clinton, who first appeared on Stewart\u2019s Comedy Central show when she was a Senator for New York promoting her 2003 memoir, Living History."}
