While new romances tend to spur some hot, and fiery intense moments of passionate lovemaking, this fire can quickly start to go out over time as sexy lingerie, and sex toys have collected dust in the drawer. Some couples are under the false pretense that because they\u2019ve been in a relationship for years, they have to settle for less than satisfying, mediocre sex. Whether you\u2019re looking to rekindle a flame between you and your partner, or just want to polish up your sex skills, it\u2019s time to let your inhibitions run loose with these best-kept secrets to having the best sex ever.\n\n1. Leave something to the imagination\n\nWhile busy work schedules can keep us away from our partner for a minimum of eight hours a day, it\u2019s important to keep the fire alive even while being physically apart. \u201cThey can send romantic and sexy text messages, and e-mails to each other during the day,\u201d said Dr. Fran Walfish, psychotherapist in Beverly Hills, Calif., and author of The Self-Aware Parent to Medical Daily. These messages serve as friendly reminders of how much you\u2019re sexually attracted to them, and how you appreciate their physical and internal beauty.\n\nA simple \u201cI love you\u201d is effective, but a real moment of eye contact and mutual appreciation, can make a difference between a bored \u201clove you,\u201d and an enticing \u201clove you.\u201d Couples can even try to engage in early morning sex to get their morning started on the right foot. This can encourage partners send messages to each other about their risqu\u00e9 morning quicky. A study conducted at the Sydney IVF Clinic in Australia found frequent morning sex can improve sperm quality, and even improve fertility in a woman.\n\n2. Spend at least one day a month away from your partner\n\nCouples who have separate lives, or do things independently have the opportunity to miss each other, and actually appreciate the time they spend together after a brief, or short time away from each other. A 2013 study found a night away from your partner can improve the amount of sex in a relationship, as partners tend to convey more energy, and less feelings of stress about problems at home. Walfish believes no one is attracted to a dependent personality, and when individuals begin to develop, and nurture their own areas of interest, they appear more attractive and appealing partners.\n\n3. Talk in the bedroom\n\nCouples should communicate their sexual needs and wants to each other in the bedroom. \u201cI find one the weakest links in the bedroom, particularly for women, is not vocalizing what feels good to them,\u201d Walfish said. She believes men are better than women when it comes to asking for their bedroom needs and wants to be fulfilled. This is due to a generation and cultural thing as women were previously taught to be the homemakers, cook, and clean, and do their duty in the bedroom, while men brought the pay check home.\n\nWalfish suggests men need to become more comfortable at requesting specific things they want, such as the frequency, the speed, and the type of sex they want and need. The statistics for men cheating in a relationship are much higher, and in order to cut that number down she says, men should get more comfortable asking what they need from their partners, and wives, which may help preserve fidelity. Sexual desire tends to be one of the most common contributing factors as to why people cheat.\n\nTherefore, men and women, speak up about what you want in the bedroom to have more satisfying sex. A 2012 study found those who talked about sex while participating in the act, were even more sexually satisfied than their non-verbal counterparts. For those coy about verbalizing sexual desires, start with non-verbal cues to give your partner clues to your deepest and darkest desires.\n\n4. Try something new together\n\nCouples who have fallen in a rut, or into a predictable routine need to shake things up in, and out the bedroom. Lesli Doares, a marriage and family therapist in Raleigh and Cary, N.C., advises couples to go on vacation, and spend lots of time together outside of the bedroom. This will translate to more fun when they get back to the bedroom. \u201c[C]hange up time of day, positions, role play, or whatever feels good, Doares told Medical Daily. \u201cDeveloping a sense of humor about sex and intimacy can go a long way to improving it.\u201d\n\nResearch shows a small, and simple change can even yield higher rewards in the bedroom. Although counterintuitive from the previous piece of advice, Walfish told Medical Daily, when it comes to getting out of a rut, \u201cuse your fantasies and shut your mouth.\u201d \u201cDo not share your fantasies with your partner.\u201d This can stimulate rivalry, and jealously. She added, \u201c'if you want to screw the NFL, halleluiah and cheers, but don't tell your husband!\u201d When it comes to sex, put all your worries in a box, lock the box, and leave it outside the bedroom. \u201cFree yourselves to enjoy the moment,\u201d Walfish said.\n\n5. Decorate your bedroom purple\n\nWhether purple is your favorite color or not, it can do wonders for your sex life. A study done by retailer Littlewoods.com found those who had purple d\u00e9cor, had approximately four intimate encounters a week. Red bedrooms came in second with about three intimate encounters a week. Go ahead and buy some purple bedding, or furniture to have a more active sex life.\n\nTake these bedroom tips into consider to boost your sex life. \u201cIt is important to make any corrections outside of the bedroom at a time when you are both feeling positive about the relationship,\u201d Doares said. Sex is very personal, and it can become easy to get hurt and defensive about it.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "better sex, sex life, best sex ever, boost sex, lovemaking, romantic, sexy, orgasms, sexual health", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Try these scientifically-proven ways \u2014 from sending romantic and sexy text messages and e-mails to buying purple furniture \u2014 to instantly have a more satisfying sex life.", "title": "5 Science-Approved Secrets To Improve Your Sex Life Instantly", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/best-sex-ever-5-little-known-ways-have-better-sex-life-backed-science-288708", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/17/couple-hugging-each-other-bed.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Try these scientifically-proven ways \u2014 from sending romantic and sexy text messages and e-mails to buying purple furniture \u2014 to instantly have a more satisfying sex life.", "title": "5 Science-Approved Secrets To Improve Your Sex Life Instantly", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/best-sex-ever-5-little-known-ways-have-better-sex-life-backed-science-288708", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/17/couple-hugging-each-other-bed.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/17/couple-hugging-each-other-bed.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2014-06-17T18:20:25-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-17T18:20:24-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Try these scientifically-proven ways \u2014 from sending romantic and sexy text messages and e-mails to buying purple furniture \u2014 to instantly have a more satisfying sex life."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe3e01\"", "article_summary": "A study conducted at the Sydney IVF Clinic in Australia found frequent morning sex can improve sperm quality, and even improve fertility in a woman.\nTherefore, men and women, speak up about what you want in the bedroom to have more satisfying sex.\nDecorate your bedroom purpleWhether purple is your favorite color or not, it can do wonders for your sex life.\nWalfish suggests men need to become more comfortable at requesting specific things they want, such as the frequency, the speed, and the type of sex they want and need.\nShe believes men are better than women when it comes to asking for their bedroom needs and wants to be fulfilled."}
