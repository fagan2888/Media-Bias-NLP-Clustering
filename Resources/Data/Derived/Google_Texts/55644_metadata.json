Jerry Brown delivered a characteristically uncharacteristic State of the State address.\n\nHis speech was brief and plainspoken. There were no special guests in the gallery to introduce, no rhetorical flourishes, no grand visions of transformation \u2014 not even an obscure reference to philosophy. His bullet lists highlighted recent accomplishments, not new initiatives.\n\nBrown\u2019s theme was prudence, the watchword of his budget plan for 2016-17.\n\nHe counseled caution in a state flush with cash, warning that an economic downturn is inevitable and urging fellow Democrats eager to spread the wealth to instead hold the line.\n\n\u201cHistorically,\u201d he told a joint session of the Legislature, \u201cCalifornia budgets have been built around forecasts that assume uninterrupted growth. Just looking at the last two recessions, we notice that ongoing state spending accelerated right into the downturn.\u201d\n\nYet this wasn\u2019t simply an exercise in lowering expectations.\n\nBrown, serving his fourth term as governor, is a cagey and experienced politician who gave his first State of the State speech before some of the legislators in attendance Thursday were born.\n\nHe inherited a fiscal catastrophe five years ago and is building a legacy of fiscal responsibility. But California\u2019s revenue stream is notoriously sensitives to shifting economic winds, so his success may depend on avoiding hard-to-reverse increases in state spending. For programs that must grow, most notably health care and road maintenance, Brown is seeking dedicated funding sources. That\u2019s smart policy, but it\u2019s tricky politics.\n\nTo succeed, Brown must overcome pressure from fellow Democrats to beef up programs while the state is flush and overcome Republican opposition to raising taxes that\u2019s amplified by the state\u2019s fiscal health.\n\nBrown devoted much of his speech to warnings about the impact of an economic downturn and responding to critics in his own party who say he has shortchanged safety-net programs and ignored growing disparities in wealth and income.\n\nBrown noted that California raised the minimum wage to $10 an hour and established an earned income tax credit this year, that it has mandated paid sick leave for employees and expanded student aid, welfare-to-work and in-home care programs. He noted that spending on K-12 education and community colleges has increased 51 percent since 2011.\n\n\u201cAs the economic recovery reaches its end point and turns downward,\u201d he said, \u201cit is crucial that we honestly face and plan for these increased costs.\u201d\n\nTo that end, he wants to funnel more money into the state\u2019s rainy-day reserve fund and direct discretionary spending increases to debt relief and one-time projects such as reducing the deferred maintenance backlog at state parks and universities.\n\nThe governor\u2019s line-item veto gives him an upper hand in budget battles, but he won\u2019t prevail on taxes without a two-thirds vote in the Legislature. That will require support from a handful of Republicans even if he gets all the Democrats.\n\nCalifornia has dramatically expanded its Medi-Cal program and reduced the number of uninsured residents since the Affordable Care Act passed, but the state stands to lose $1 billion in federal money unless it replaces a tax on Medi-Cal managed-care plans that provides matching state funds. Brown says the new mechanism he has proposed \u201cis not a tax increase, no matter what anyone tells you.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Gov.
