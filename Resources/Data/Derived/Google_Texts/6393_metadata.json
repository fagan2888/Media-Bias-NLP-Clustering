Stop passing to Iginla when taking a shot is the better play.\n\nThe Avs had Sunday off, another day in a long stretch that has dragged on with Iginla trying to join the NHL\u2019s 600-goal club. Roy wants that goal to occur naturally and not have teammates force it.\n\n\u201cI thought we had good intention, (but) I guess we focused more in seeing Iggy scoring that 600th instead of playing our game,\u201d Roy said after Saturday night\u2019s 4-0 loss to visiting Calgary. \u201cWe had a few good chances and we tried to pass the puck to him instead of bringing it to the net. For example, (Alex) Tanguay is all alone in front of the net and he\u2019s trying a little (pass) to Iggy.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to refocus. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want Iggy scoring his 600th, but we need to play our game.\u201d\n\nIginla feels the same way. He would rather win the next game than become the 19th member of the 600 club. When asked if it has become a distraction, he said: \u201cI hope not. Once the game starts, I don\u2019t want (the attention). It\u2019s not like there\u2019s one game left in the year and we\u2019ve already made the playoffs. We\u2019ve talked about it. It\u2019s not (about) looking for me. Play normal and if anything, you can use me as a decoy. There\u2019s a lot of time to get (600).\u201d\n\nThis week would be a good time to get it out of the way. The Avs host Los Angeles on Monday, St. Louis on Wednesday and Nashville on Friday. Iginla has been on goal No. 599 the past three games.\n\n\u201cIt would be nice to get and make sure it\u2019s not a distraction for the team,\u201d he said. \u201cGoing forward, I\u2019d rather not talk about it every day. We need wins and we need to climb back into playoff contention.\u201d\n\nIginla played in his 1,431st game Saturday, tying Scott Mellanby and Luc Robitaille for 25th in NHL history. He is scheduled to tie Mike Gartner for 24th place Monday. Gartner and Robitaille are in the 600-goal club with 708 and 668, respectively.\n\nIginla is on the doorstep.\n\nMike Chambers: mchambers@denverpost.com or @mikechambers", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Patrick Roy tells Avs to stop focusing on Jarome Iginla\u2019s 600th goal", "title": "Patrick Roy tells Avs to stop focusing on Jarome Iginla\u2019s 600th goal", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/01/03/patrick-roy-tells-avs-to-stop-focusing-on-jarome-iginlas-600th-goal/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160103__BN20160104_Z00_BNSP04HKNAVSp1.jpg", "height": 382}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160103__BN20160104_Z00_BNSP04HKNAVSp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-03T19:50:32+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-18T23:32:28+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Stop focusing on the 600th goal of Iginla\u2019s career, that is.\nBut Avs coach Patrick Roy wants it to stop.\nEvery Avalanche player would like to assist on Jarome Iginla\u2019s next goal, and everybody affiliated with the franchise would like to see that goal scored at home.\nIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want Iggy scoring his 600th, but we need to play our game.\u201dIginla feels the same way.\nThe Avs had Sunday off, another day in a long stretch that has dragged on with Iginla trying to join the NHL\u2019s 600-goal club."}
