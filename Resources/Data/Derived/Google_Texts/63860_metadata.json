United States Immigration Case: Discretion, Dispensation, Suspension, and Pardon\u2014The Four Horsemen of Article II\n\nPresident Barack Obama has worked with Congress to enact certain policies, such as his economic stimulus package and Obamacare, but he also has often used executive orders or administrative decrees to create law. For instance, unable to persuade Congress to pass the DREAM Act, the President worked through the Department of Homeland Security to implement the act by an administrative memorandum expressly modeled on the bill\u2019s provisions. In a case now before the Supreme Court, Texas and other states have challenged the legality of this DHS policy. The Court ordered the parties to brief and address the additional question of whether the DHS memorandum violates the Take Care Clause, which requires the President to enforce the law and grants him no power to dispense with or suspend it. Given the clause\u2019s background, neither a dispensation nor a suspension authority can be deemed an inherent part of the executive power that Article II vests in the President.\n\nKey Points President Barack Obama has often used executive orders or administrative decrees to create law. Lacking statutory authority to adopt a new policy, he has relied on his authority to exercise discretion in the enforcement of the law. This power is attributed to the Take Care Clause of Article II, which vests in the President the same prerogative with respect to the front end of the criminal or civil justice system as the absolute power that the Pardon Clause gives the President at the back end of the criminal process. The Due Process Clause implements the rule of law and obliges the government to act lawfully.

About the Author Paul Larkin Senior Legal Research Fellow\n\nEdwin Meese III Center for Legal and Judicial Studies\n\nThe Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse is a well-known image. The Book of Revelation identifies them as Famine, Pestilence, Destruction, and Death.[1] Used in Revelation as a harbinger of the end of days, the imagery has been reused in other contexts as a metaphor to herald the end of a political state, such as the Roman Empire. The same metaphor can be used to signify the end of the Barack Obama presidency.\n\nThe Framers anticipated that legislation would represent the formal implementation of policy. That was why they spent most of the Convention of 1787 debating issues such as how, given the existence of large states and small ones, to select Members of Congress,[2] what legislative powers the new Congress should have,[3] and how Congress could turn a policy into a \u201cLaw.\u201d[4]\n\nAt the outset of his time in office, President Obama worked with Congress to enact as law policies that he believed were necessary to benefit the nation. Two examples are his economic stimulus package and Obamacare. Another one was a reform of the federal sentencing laws for the distribution of crack cocaine. Believing that the disparity between the sentences imposed on offenders who dealt in crack versus powdered cocaine was unjust,[5] he persuaded Congress to enact the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010,[6] which greatly reduced that disparity on a prospective basis.[7]\n\nWhen his party lost control of the House of Representatives and Senate, however, President Obama shifted gears. Since then, he has often used executive orders or administrative decrees (issued by different departments) rather than legislation to create law. In fact, sometimes he has issued such decrees in the teeth of the very laws that he helped enact early in his first term, such as Obamacare.[8]\n\nOne of the horsemen he has ridden is the pardon power. That power is a descendant of the crown\u2019s inherent power to extend mercy to an offender, now expressly granted to the President by the Pardon Clause of Article II of the Constitution.[9] The Pardon Clause enables the President to reduce the punishment imposed by a court or to erase a judgment of conviction entirely.[10] When Congress refused to amend the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 so that it would apply retroactively, President Obama created the Clemency Project 2014 so that he could commute the sentences of deserving prisoners who could not take advantage of that law.[11] He recently exercised that authority[12] and likely will continue to do so throughout his remaining time in office.\n\nPresident Obama also has sought to invoke executive authority with regard to immigration. More than 11 million aliens are in the United States illegally, either because they entered without a passport or visa or because they overstayed their authorized time in this country.[13] A bill colloquially known as the DREAM Act[14] would enable aliens who are here illegally to remain in the United States if they could satisfy several criteria: for example, that they entered the United States at age 15 (or younger) and have lived here for five (or more) years, are of \u201cgood moral character,\u201d and have either graduated from high school or earned a general educational development (GED) certification.[15] Unable to persuade Congress to pass the DREAM Act, the President decided to implement the act\u2019s provisions by means of a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) administrative memorandum expressly modeled on the bill\u2019s provisions.[16]\n\nLacking express statutory authority to adopt the new policy, the President has relied on an Article II power different from the Pardon Clause: the President\u2019s authority to exercise discretion in the enforcement of the law, a power attributed to the Take Care Clause of Article II.[17] In the government\u2019s view, the DHS has the discretion to decide how to allocate its scarce resources to those instances in which the immigration laws and the nation\u2019s interests are best served. The new policy fits that description, DHS argues, because it subordinates to more pressing deportation proceedings the need to institute hearings to deport aliens whose presence in the nation poses no risk to national or internal security and whose deportation would pose a serious hardship on them. The government\u2019s argument is quite symmetrical: The Take Care Clause vests in the President the same prerogative with respect to the front end of the criminal or civil justice system as the absolute power that the Pardon Clause gives the President at the back end of the criminal process.\n\nThis is a case where the text of Article II alone cannot answer the question whether the DHS policy is lawful.[18] Also illuminating is the English legal and political background to Article II. That history reveals a deliberate attempt to cabin the power of a chief executive to those instances that implement the authority that the Framers or Congress have vested in the President. In particular, that relevant history reveals two implicit but clear limitations on the President\u2019s authority: The President cannot dispense with the application of the law for particular people, and he cannot suspend the operation of a law in its entirety. Accordingly, whether the DHS policy is lawful can be answered only by defining the channel in which a President may act.\n\nThe DHS Policy and the Texas Lawsuit\n\nBefore the Supreme Court this term is the case of United States v. Texas.[19] The case involves a challenge by Texas and other states to the legality of the DHS policy. Texas and 25 other states brought this litigation, arguing that the policy is invalid under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA)[20] because the DHS did not submit it for notice-and-comment review before it went into effect. The district court issued a preliminary injunction preventing the DHS from implementing its policy,[21] and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, by a divided vote, affirmed.[22]\n\nThe United States petitioned the Supreme Court to review the case. The government argued that the lower courts erred for several reasons: Texas lacked Article III standing to bring this lawsuit; Texas does not have a justiciable claim under the APA; the DHS guidance memorandum is not subject to the APA notice-and-comment requirement; and, in any event, the policy is not arbitrary, capricious, or otherwise unlawful.[23] The Supreme Court granted the government\u2019s petition in January but added an interesting wrinkle to the case: The Court ordered the parties to brief and address the additional question whether the DHS memorandum violates the Take Care Clause. The result of that order was to increase the importance of an already significant case.\n\nThe Take Care Clause has not been the subject of many Supreme Court decisions. Ordinarily, the clause arises in only one of two fairly narrow contexts: Someone who would benefit from the government\u2019s enforcement of a law challenges the government\u2019s refusal to initiate a civil or criminal action of some kind,[24] or someone who is the target of a government lawsuit or indictment claims that the government has acted with an invidious motive of one type or another.[25] Yet even in those contexts, the Court has not said a great deal about the content of the clause. Typically, the clause makes no more than a cameo appearance during a discussion of the Court\u2019s precedents, making the point either that the plaintiff cannot bring a lawsuit to force the government to sue or charge a third party or that the President and his lieutenants enjoy considerable charging discretion, which was not abused in the case at hand.[26] What is more, most of the discussion in those cases focuses on the Court\u2019s case law rather than on the text or history of the clause.\n\nOf course, the text of the Take Care Clause is sparse, as is its history, so perhaps we should not be surprised at the Court\u2019s disinterest in learning its metes and bounds. That disinterest, however, may have disappeared. By directing the parties in United States v. Texas to address the legality of the DHS memorandum under the Take Care Clause, the Court appears to be interested in learning about its content, which will spur the parties and amici to plumb whatever depths exist to give that clause meaning.\n\nThe Court has often displayed interest in learning the historical background to different provisions of the Constitution. The Court has done so in cases involving civil liberties found in the text of the Constitution[27] or in the Bill of Rights[28] and in cases raising issues concerning the structure of American government, which includes both separation of powers and federalism concerns.[29] In the latter category, an issue can often be resolved only by considering the interplay of several provisions against the background problem(s) that the Framers sought to remedy or forestall.\n\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s frequent reliance on history to illuminate the meaning of the Constitution\u2019s text should not come as a great surprise to anyone. The theory of judicial review known as Originalism affords great weight to how the Framers\u2019 generation would have understood a term found in the Constitution.[30] Of course, not everyone agrees with that approach to constitutional interpretation. Some lawyers, scholars, and even Supreme Court justices follow a different path.[31] At times, the full Court has also abandoned that approach by reading into the Constitution rights nowhere found in its text or background.[32] The Court\u2019s rationale has been that, to remain a vibrant document, the Constitution must adapt to new circumstances.[33]\n\nHowever one resolves that debate, it would be a strange rule of jurisprudence that would give no weight to the history of the problem(s) that any legal text sought to resolve by the written word.[34] That approach would deprive judges of a useful, sometimes even dispositive, aid to the meaning of an ambiguous term. In an extreme case, it could unmoor the text from its history and allow a judge to craft a jurisprudence that is more a work of fiction than a constitutional biography.[35]\n\nWith that point in mind, the question is whether the history says anything useful about the issues in United States v. Texas. The answer, it turns out, is yes.\n\nMagna Carta: The Law Becomes Sovereign\n\nEarly English law began in the seventh century as unwritten local customs followed by each separate community.[36] William the Conqueror left those indigenous customs in place, but he and his successors sought to solidify the crown\u2019s control of the island by creating a centralized judicial system whose judgments would have the crown\u2019s backing. Over time, the decisions of the king\u2019s judges became the common law of England, governing all communities in the realm.[37]\n\nWhat was particularly noteworthy about the common law was that one of the communities it governed was the one formed by the king\u2019s court. One of the unique features of English law was its position at the top of the hierarchy of sovereigns. By the 13th century, a fundamental principle of English legal and political theory was that the common law was sovereign, not the king\u2019s decree. The law was the body of customs that, over time, English society had accepted as its governing rules.\n\nOne of those principles, known as the \u201crule of law,\u201d was that even the king was subject to the law.[38] The king\u2019s decrees may have been the law elsewhere, but not in England. In fact, it was the law that gave the king the authority to govern, as well as grant the people certain inalienable rights that even the crown could not take away.[39]\n\nIn 1215, the rule of law took on a concrete form in Magna Carta.[40] Unlike the Declaration of Independence or the Declaration of the Rights of Man, which sought to justify different revolutions by pleading that the government had violated the natural rights of man, Magna Carta was a peace treaty designed to end a civil war. Tired of King John\u2019s continued arbitrary rule, the English barons renounced their oath of loyalty to the crown, rebelled against John, and reasserted the sovereign nature of settled English customs. Fearing a loss in battle, King John acceded to the barons\u2019 demands \u201cin the meadow which is called Runnymede, between Windsor and Staines, on the fifteenth day of June, in the seventeenth year of [his] reign.\u201d[41]\n\nMagna Carta\u2019s most famous provision is Article 39, which made explicit the principle that the law, not the crown, was sovereign by providing that \u201c[n]o free man shall be taken or imprisoned or disseised or outlawed or exiled or in any way ruined, nor will we go or send against him, except by the lawful judgment of his peers or by the law of the land.\u201d[42] The guarantee that the crown could rule only in accordance with \u201cthe law of the land\u201d meant, according to Coke, that \u201cno man [could] be taken or imprisoned, but per legem terrae, that is, by the common law, statute law, or custome of England.\u201d[43]\n\nBy making clear that the law was sovereign, Article 39 foreshadowed in England the effect that our Constitution would have in America.[44] As William Pitt later observed, that article became \u201cthe Bible of the English Constitution.\u201d[45] It provided the foundation for other well-known acts of Parliament granting various other civil liberties to the English people since 1215.[46] But Magna Carta is primus inter pares\u2014first among equals.\n\nThe Glorious Revolution: Parliament Replaces the Law as Sovereign\n\nAs far as the issue of sovereignty was concerned, the English crown did not go gentle into that good night.[47] Before the ink was dry on the Great Charter, King John repudiated it and reinitiated his war with the barons. Only his death the following year brought the war to a close. John\u2019s minor son, King Henry III, became king, and to quell the rebellion, he reissued Magna Carta, with Article 39 intact, which again officially made the law sovereign.[48]\n\nNonetheless, the battle between the crown and Parliament over which was sovereign continued for centuries, just without the open warfare of the early years of the 13th century. Ostensibly, sovereignty rested in both the King and Parliament (termed \u201cthe King in Parliament\u201d), but each one jockeyed for position. When Charles I became king in 1625, the separation of powers contest began in earnest. It reached its peak during the period from 1642 to 1689\u2014the era of the Civil War, the Interregnum, the Restoration, and the Glorious Revolution\u2014with Parliament ultimately coming out on top.[49]\n\nTwo factors together played an important role in the d\u00e9nouement of that conflict.[50] The first was the crown\u2019s never-ending claim of sovereignty. Notwithstanding Article 39, the English kings claimed that they were sovereign, not the law, and so could lawfully \u201cdispense\u201d with the laws (to exempt particular individuals from complying with them) or \u201csuspend\u201d the operation of a law entirely (to put it into the penalty box for some period). That authority resembled the one that popes had exercised to excuse compliance with canon law.[51]\n\nThe parallel was troubling because of the second factor: religious differences between the House of Stuart and members of Parliament (as well as the vast majority of the population). England had broken from Rome in the 16th century under Henry VIII, who appointed himself head of the Church of England. Distrust of the Church of Rome and Roman Catholics led to discrimination against them as official policy. Examples of that policy were the Test Acts of 1673 and 1678, which imposed (among other things) a religious test to hold public office. King James II, however, was Catholic. Following the adoption of the Test Acts, he tried to exercise a dispensation power to exempt Catholics from the requirements of those acts so that he could appoint them to positions in the civilian government and the military.\n\nJames II\u2019s actions created the fear that the army could come under the control of Catholics and be used to suppress England\u2019s liberties. Parliament protested. The contest continued until late 1689, when James II fled England in order to avoid the fate that had befallen his father, Charles I, who lost not just his throne, but also his head.\n\nThe result was twofold. The Glorious Revolution established that Parliament had become legally and politically superior to the crown.[52] Even the new king and queen accepted that political reality, to the point that in their coronation oaths, William and Mary agreed to govern according to the laws of Parliament.[53] Given the events preceding it, that concession alone royally acknowledged Parliament\u2019s superior authority.[54]\n\nBut that was not all. The Glorious Revolution also established parliamentary sovereignty over the common law, the long-accepted English customs that effectively had given rise to an unwritten constitution. That law was no longer sovereign; Parliament was, because it could change the law. It could repeal even historic laws like Magna Carta (although that was and is most unlikely).[55] Thomas Hobbes had theorized that there was but one sovereign in every society. After the Glorious Revolution, Parliament held that title. To emphasize that point, the Bill of Rights of 1689 expressly denied the crown any power to suspend or dispense with the law absent Parliament\u2019s permission.[56] Parliament\u2019s victory was now complete.\n\nThe American Constitution: The Law Returns as Sovereign\n\nLike their English predecessors,[57] the Colonists cherished the rule of law because it protected them against arbitrary government rule.[58] As New York University Law Professor William Nelson has noted, \u201cOne of the most intense concerns of Americans in the prerevolutionary period was to render individuals secure in their lives, liberties, and properties from abuses of governmental power.\u201d[59]\n\nIn one regard, the Colonists\u2019 understanding of \u201cthe rule of law\u201d sharply diverged from the English view. By the time of the American Revolution, the Colonists distrusted Parliament as much as, if not more than, they distrusted King George III. The Colonists believed that \u201cmen and especially men in power are prone to corruption\u201d and that Parliament could be as arbitrary as the King.[60] \u201cThe danger to liberty was what it had always been: departure from the rule of customary law\u201d in favor of \u201ca rule of arbitrary command.\u201d[61] \u201cThe difference,\u201d as NYU Law Professor John Phillip Reid argues, \u201cwas that now a House of Parliament, not just the Crown, had to be watched.\u201d[62]\n\nBut the Colonists completely agreed with their countrymen that the law must restrain the executive, and the American Constitution reflects that understanding. In Article I, the Constitution grants \u201c[a]ll legislative Powers\u201d to Congress.[63] In Article II, it vests in the President not a power to make, to create, or to suspend the law, but a duty to \u201ctake care that the Laws be faithfully executed.\u201d[64] That difference is illuminating as to the different roles Congress and the President should play.\n\nThe Due Process Clause in the Fifth Amendment implements the rule of law.[65] The lineal descendent of Article 39 of Magna Carta, that clause, whatever else it may require, obliges the government to act lawfully. Over time, we have forgotten that core meaning of due process because the Supreme Court has been working around (and beyond) its periphery by expanding its reach to require the government to provide hearings before suspending government benefits[66] or to forbid the government from interfering in certain private decisions, such as abortion.[67] But the irreducible meaning of the Due Process Clause is that the executive must comply with the law.[68] In the United States, the law is sovereign because ours is \u201ca government of laws, and not of men.\u201d[69]\n\nDoes that mean the President lacks discretion to decide which cases to select for prosecution, suit, or deportation? No; he may be selective. Of course, it is not obvious that the source of that discretion is the Take Care Clause (it certainly cannot be the Pardon Clause). After all, it seems odd to treat a directive to execute the law as granting the recipient discretion to refrain from doing just that. Nevertheless, long-standing Supreme Court case law states that executive branch officials have discretion to decide whether and how to enforce the law[70] and that this discretion is traceable to the Take Care Clause.[71] If the clause does grant the President discretion, the reason must be that the President can \u201cfaithfully\u201d execute the responsibilities of his office without needing to enforce every law all the time without exception.\n\nCorporate law is illuminating in this regard. A chief executive officer can see to the faithful execution of the firm\u2019s business without aggressively pursuing every possible opportunity. He can be choosy in the ventures that he proposes or implements. He can even donate money to charities that would otherwise go to shareholders if he believes that doing so is in the company\u2019s best interests.[72] His function is to define corporate policy and guide its implementation, not to carry into effect every business proposal he or his subordinates may devise.\n\nThe President occupies a parallel position in the federal system. He sits atop the executive branch. His responsibilities are enormous and only grow larger with each Congress. It would be impossible for him to personally manage the affairs of any one of his departments. For that reason, the Constitution recognizes that he will appoint lieutenants to carry out his directives, just as a company chief executive officer appoints subordinate corporate officers. The President therefore can \u201cfaithfully\u201d execute the law as long as he performs the functions of his office to the best of his abilities.\n\nThat understanding of the President\u2019s constitutional responsibilities also accords with the average, everyday expectations of the electorate. The nation elects a President and hopes that he will exercise judgment in the best interests of the nation. He need not sue everyone who commits a tort, charge every person who commits a crime, or deport every illegal alien. The President can fulfill the responsibilities of his office (including staying within his budget) by establishing priorities and directing his lieutenants to carry them out.\n\nIf there were any doubt about that matter, it would be erased by the fact that Congress does not grant the President unlimited funds to enforce the law. Consider just the criminal law. The first federal crime act created approximately 30 offenses;[73] today, there are thousands of federal crimes, more than the government could ever enforce.[74] Yet Congress limits the amount that the President can spend on immigration enforcement to whatever sum it appropriates for the Department of Justice. The Anti-Deficiency Act,[75] moreover, keeps the President from running up a debt by prohibiting him from spending money that has not been appropriated. Thus, even if the Take Care Clause did not empower the President to exercise discretion as to how he will see to the enforcement of the law, the federal appropriations laws force the President to set priorities within the limitations that Congress has defined.[76]\n\nThe history discussed above is illuminating in this regard.[77] Parliament clipped the crown\u2019s wings by legislating that no king or queen could dispense with or suspend the law absent Parliament\u2019s authorization. The Framers did not wrest that power from Congress and give it to the President. Instead, they imposed on the President a duty to see to the faithful execution of the law. Whatever the reach of the President\u2019s discretionary authority to enforce the law, he cannot go so far as to dispense with or suspend its application.\n\nTo be sure, the Constitution does not expressly deny the President a dispensation or suspension power; the text is silent on those subjects. Yet they are implicit in Article II. Why? The Constitution delegates only limited and identified powers to the federal government, leaving the remainder to the states, and of those limited federal powers, Article II delegates only certain specified ones to the President. Neither a dispensation nor a suspension power is among them.[78] That omission is important, given the history of the contest between Parliament and the Stuart kings over sovereignty. That background reveals that a President may exercise a dispensation or suspension authority only insofar as Congress empowers him to do so.\n\nPut yourself in the Framers\u2019 shoes. They did not give George Washington the power claimed by James II to dispense with or suspend the operation of the laws, even though he had just led America to a victory over the English and was likely the most revered leader in the nation. The nation also certainly has not given those powers to any President since then. The conclusion is inescapable: Neither dispensation nor suspension is a part of the authority given the President by the Take Care Clause, regardless of how broadly that clause is construed.\n\nThe Four Horsemen and the Law\n\nHow does all that fit together? This way.\n\nThe Four Horsemen metaphorically signified the imminent fall of the Roman Empire. The end of a President\u2019s second full term of office represents a similar demise. By that point, particularly when we reach the eighth and last year of a President\u2019s tenure, as we have now, the President is at the ebb of his power. Congress does not fear him (if it ever did) because he will soon be gone. His own party focuses on the people competing to be the next candidate and next President. The opposing party not only runs against him, but also is ordinarily unwilling to engage in the type of political compromises necessary to pass most types of important legislation. The President never becomes irrelevant, either to politics or to the process of governance, but he no longer can rely on the first branch of government to cooperate on much of anything other than preventing imminent national catastrophes and keeping the government running until his successor takes office.\n\nThe result is that Presidents will often take unilaterally whatever actions they can arguably perform. Presidents may sometimes focus on foreign policy, an area where the law gives him the greatest latitude.[79] If a President remains interested in domestic policy, he may rely on executive orders or agency policy statements to accomplish any results he wants to see become law, at least until his term ends.\n\nIt also is not uncommon to see Presidents ride two of the four available horses\u2014Discretion and Pardon\u2014in the twilight hours of their time in the Oval Office. The Justice Department filed an antitrust lawsuit against IBM in the waning hours of Lyndon Johnson\u2019s Administration, a case that became the legal version of the Vietnam War: long, costly, and ultimately resulting in a winless withdrawal. President Bill Clinton \u201cused his clemency power promiscuously in his last 24 hours in office, granting pardons and commutations the way that a drunken sailor on shore leave spends money.\u201d[80] The other two horsemen\u2014Dispensation and Suspension\u2014may not be far away, since they are just more aggressive versions of Discretion.\n\nTo be sure, history reveals that the President may be able to exercise his clemency power virtually in a manner unchecked by law.[81] The United States, however, does not rely on the President\u2019s pardon power to defend the DHS policy. Nor could it do so, because that defense would require the President each new day to \u201cpardon\u201d someone for his unlawful presence the day before, an action that would be tantamount to dispensing with or suspending the operation of the law for one or more people.\n\nHistory demonstrates that President Obama has no such power.[82] The Stuart kings claimed that power, but the Glorious Revolution proved that only Parliament could exercise it. The attempt to exercise it cost Charles I his head and James II his throne. Aware of those outcomes, the Framers did not include any such authority under the umbrella of the Take Care Clause.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe federal government did not ask the Supreme Court to address the Take Care Clause. The Court came up with that issue by itself. As a consequence, the Court may not be aware of the interplay between that horseman\u2014Discretion\u2014and the three others\u2014Dispensation, Suspension, and Pardon. The English history detailing the battle between the crown and Parliament over sovereignty reveals how far the President may and may not exercise Discretion.\n\nThat lesson is an important one when considering the power granted to the President by the Take Care Clause. Its text imposes a duty on the President to enforce the law and grants him no power to dispense with or suspend it. Given the clause\u2019s background, neither a dispensation nor a suspension authority can be deemed an inherent part of the executive power that Article II vests in the President. Any such claim would be inconsistent with the \u201crule of law,\u201d a principle represented by the Constitution itself, a charter that the Framers intended to be the sovereign. To enforce its sovereignty, they created not a monarch, but a President: an executive, not a king, and certainly not a king with greater power than George III could have exercised.\n\nAbout the Author Paul Larkin Senior Legal Research Fellow\n\nEdwin Meese III Center for Legal and Judicial Studies\n\nShow references in this reportHide References [1] Revelation 6:1\u20138.

Time works changes, brings into existence new conditions and purposes. Therefore a principle, to be vital, must be capable of wider application than the mischief which gave it birth. This is peculiarly true of constitutions. They are not ephemeral enactments, designed to meet passing occasions. They are, to use the words of Chief Justice Marshall, \u2018designed to approach immortality as nearly as human institutions can approach it.\u2019 The future is their care, and provision for events of good and bad tendencies of which no prophecy can be made. In the application of a constitution, therefore, our contemplation cannot be only of what has been, but of what may be. Under any other rule a constitution would indeed be as easy of application as it would be deficient in efficacy and power. Its general principles would have little value, and be converted by precedent into impotent and lifeless formulas. Rights declared in words might be lost in reality. And this has been recognized.

The value of Magna Carta thus lies not only in forcing the King to respect certain rules, but also in making him obey the rule of law in general.

The events of the Cromwellian period, the Restoration and the Revolution of 1688, and finally the evolution of the system of ministerial government under the Hanoverian Kings, all tended to create a practical legal supremacy in Parliament. Whig theory and practice made royal authority subordinate to Parliament, and Godden v. Hales [89 Eng. Rep. 1050 (K.B. 1686)] in 1686 represented the court\u2019s last imposition of a constitutional limit on parliamentary authority in the name of the royal prerogative.

I am fairly convinced Chapter 29 [the renumbered version of the original Article 39] will not be.

Colonial leaders were familiar with the works of Algernon Sydney, [James] Harington, and [John] Locke, who urged every Englishman to resist every grasp for power; to stand firm on ancient principles of liberty, whether embalmed in acts of Parliament or adumbrated in the \u2018Law of Nature.\u2019\u201d Samuel Eliot Morison, The Oxford History of the American People 180 (1965).

Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, 588 (1952) (hereafter Steel Seizure Case) (\u201cThe President\u2019s order does not direct that a congressional policy be executed in a manner prescribed by Congress\u2014it directs that a presidential policy be executed in a manner prescribed by the President. The preamble of the order itself, like that of many statutes, sets out reasons why the President believes certain policies should be adopted, proclaims these policies as rules of conduct to be followed, and again, like a statute, authorizes a government official to promulgate additional rules and regulations consistent with the policy proclaimed and needed to carry that policy into execution. The power of Congress to adopt such public policies as those proclaimed by the order is beyond question. It can authorize the taking of private property for public use. It can make laws regulating the relationships between employers and employees, prescribing rules designed to settle labor disputes, and fixing wages and working conditions in certain fields of our economy. The Constitution did not subject this law-making power of Congress to presidential or military supervision or control.\u201d). [64] U.S. Const. art. II, cl. 3; see Steel Seizure Case, 343 U.S. at 587\u201388 (\u201cIn the framework of our Constitution, the President\u2019s power to see that the laws are faithfully executed refutes the idea that he is to be a lawmaker. The Constitution limits his functions in the lawmaking process to the recommending of laws he thinks wise and the vetoing of laws he thinks bad. And the Constitution is neither silent nor equivocal about who shall make laws which the President is to execute. The first section of the first article says that \u2018All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States * * *.\u2019 After granting many powers to the Congress, Article I goes on to provide that Congress may \u2018make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers and all other Powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States, or in any Department or Officer thereof.\u2019\u201d); Kendall v. United States ex rel. Stokes, 37 U.S. 524, 612\u201313 (1838) (\u201cIt was urged at the bar, that the postmaster general was alone subject to the direction and control of the President, with respect to the execution of the duty imposed upon him by this law, and this right of the President is claimed, as growing out of the obligation imposed upon him by the constitution, to take care that the laws be faithfully executed. This is a doctrine that cannot receive the sanction of this court. It would be vesting in the President a dispensing power, which has no countenance for its support in any part of the constitution; and is asserting a principle, which, if carried out in its results, to all cases falling within it, would be clothing the President with a power entirely to control the legislation of congress, and paralyze the administration of justice. [\u00b6] To contend that the obligation imposed on the President to see the laws faithfully executed, implies a power to forbid their execution, is a novel construction of the constitution, and entirely inadmissible.\u201d).

Full execution may be defeated because Congress declines to create offices indispensable for that purpose; or because Congress, having created the office, declines to make the indispensable appropriation; or because Congress, having both created the office and made the appropriation, prevents, by restrictions which it imposes, the appointment of officials who in quality and character are indispensable to the efficient execution of the law. If, in any such way, adequate means are denied to the President, the fault will lie with Congress. The President performs his full constitutional duty, if, with the means and instruments provided by Congress and within the limitations prescribed by it, he uses his best endeavors to secure the faithful execution of the laws enacted.\u201d). [77] The United States does not discuss the history noted above in its treatment of the Take Care Clause in its opening brief in United States v. Texas. See Pet. Br. 73\u201376. [78] It is not odd to see the President\u2019s Article II powers as limited. Whatever charging discretion he may have under the Take Care Clause, he may not charge someone with a crime simply because of the latter\u2019s race. See, e.g., Armstrong, 517 U.S. at 463\u201367. [79] See, e.g., Zivotofsky ex rel. Zivotofsky v. Kerry, 135 S. Ct. 2076, 2090 (2015) (\u201c[J]udicial precedent and historical practice teach that it is for the President alone to make the specific decision of what foreign power he will recognize as legitimate, both for the Nation as a whole and for the purpose of making his own position clear within the context of recognition in discussions and negotiations with foreign nations.\u201d).

See Ex parte Garland, 71 U.S. (4 Wall.) 333, 380 (1867) (\u201cThis power of the President is not subject to legislative control.\u201d); 2 Joseph Story, Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States \u00a7 1504, at 324 n.4 (2011) (4th ed.
