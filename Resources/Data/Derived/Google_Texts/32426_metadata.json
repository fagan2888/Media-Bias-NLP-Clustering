Friedman (a Clinton appointee) concluded that somewhere in the thousands of pages of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), one \u201cclear\u201d and \u201cunambiguous\u201d provision means the opposite of what it says.\n\nThe case is Halbig v. Sebelius, a lawsuit challenging Internal Revenue Service (IRS) regulations that permit\u2014without statutory authorization\u2014tax subsidies to residents of the 26 states that are refusing to capitulate to Obamacare\u2019s demand for state-run health-insurance exchanges. Unfortunately, Judge Friedman granted the government\u2019s motion for summary judgment against the plaintiffs, ending the case at the trial-court level and setting it up for appeal to the newly appointed Obama loyalists at the D.C. Circuit.\n\nJudge Friedman\u2019s opinion is a fascinating example of loop-the-loop statutory interpretation. The key question is whether the phrase \u201can Exchange established by the State\u201d means \u201can Exchange established by the State,\u201d or whether it actually means \u201can Exchange established by the State or HHS.\u201d He acknowledges that the \u201cplain language . . . viewed in isolation\u201d appears to support the challengers\u2019 contention that \u201cby the State\u201d refers to a state, not to HHS, that the definitions of all of the relevant statutory terms match the plaintiffs\u2019 interpretation of the law, and that the ACA repeatedly refers to a tax subsidy for plans on an exchange \u201cestablished by a State.\u201d (Slip op. at 26\u201328). But Judge Friedman is not content with statutory definitions and intra-textual uniformity. No, to spring the interpretive lock, he accepts the IRS\u2019s explanation of how the statute works and in light of that explanation, concludes that the statute is \u201cunambiguous.\u201d (Slip op. at 28\u201329). He goes on to cast the net wider to find \u201ccontext\u201d for this interpretation in the rest of the Obamacare statute. (Slip op. at 29\u201335).\n\nThere are several important flaws in this analysis. To begin with, Judge Friedman holds that the statute is unambiguous, so he doesn\u2019t have to defer to the IRS interpretation. But he also doesn\u2019t explain why the statute is textually unambiguous. He asks: Why would Congress have said that the credit applies to exchanges \u201cestablished by the State\u201d if it intended to mean \u201cExchanges created by a state or by HHS?\u201d\n\nGood question. That\u2019s why the plaintiffs sued.\n\nTo answer the question, however, Judge Friedman accepts without qualification the government\u2019s self-serving explanation of how the statute is supposed to work, then claims that any other interpretation of the statute would create \u201canomalies.\u201d (Never mind that these \u201canomalies\u201d actually make clear that Congress knew how to distinguish between provisions that apply only to State exchanges and repeatedly did so.) But that issue is actually the whole case, and Judge Friedman just accepts the IRS\u2019s say-so without significant analysis. In other words, the statute is so \u201cunambiguous\u201d and \u201cclear\u201d that it can only mean something completely different from what it says. Got that?\n\nMoreover, Judge Friedman drops a footnote on the second-to-last page of his opinion saying that even if the statute were ambiguous, the IRS interpretation would be upheld as a reasonable construction of the statute. (Under Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, when a statute is ambiguous, courts defer to the administrative agency\u2019s reasonable interpretation of the statute.) But this, too, elides the central issue in the case: The IRS says the statute means something it doesn\u2019t say. This means that the ACA is not ambiguous and the government\u2019s interpretation is unreasonable.\n\nAlthough summary judgment in the district court is a setback, appeal seems likely. For in-depth discussion of the ACA subsidies, Case Western Reserve law professor Jonathan Adler and Cato Institute scholar Michael Cannon published a scholarly article about these issues.
