(AP) - Giovanni Ravenna and Nick Galindo kept watch as the temperature crept toward 150 degrees.\n\nIt was an otherwise normal day in chemistry professor Dr. Matt McCarroll\u2019s lab. SIU students gathered in small teams around hot plates to watch chemical reactions in beakers.\n\nBut far from synthesizing polymers or conjuring chemiluminescence, McCarroll\u2019s students had a tastier end product on the brain - beer.\n\n\u201cThe beer and brewing kind of causes them to accidentally learn chemistry,\u201d McCarroll said.\n\nIt\u2019s all part of SIU\u2019s new Fermentation Science Institute, a group that supports education and research related to fermentation industries, such as craft brewing, distilling, cheese-making and pharmaceuticals. And now, McCarroll is making a push to start a fermentation degree program.\n\nIt\u2019s a curriculum he thinks will position students for jobs in up-and-coming industries like craft brewing.\n\n\u201cThe fermentation-related industry is a perfect partnership between science, technology and agriculture,\u201d he said. \u201cAs we\u2019re seeing with the breweries popping up, this represents a new growth area for local and regional development. The university has the potential to really help.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Brewers Association, a trade group that promotes independent breweries, the craft industry grew by 20 percent, to $14.3 billion in retail dollar value, from 2012 to 2013. And production has nearly doubled since 2007, with 15.6 million barrels brewed in 2013 alone.\n\nMcCarroll said brewers of all sizes are looking for young professionals skilled in the art of fermentation, and SIU would become one of only a handful of colleges throughout the U.S. to offer a fermentation degree program.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a huge amount of students that would like to go into fermentation-related industries,\u201d he said. \u201cGetting jobs at some of the more desirable employers can be competitive, so having the degree can give them an advantage and give them the tools to succeed once they get the jobs.\u201d\n\nMcCarroll said he\u2019s already developing research partnerships with Budweiser and St. Louis-based Schlafly\u2019s.\n\nMcCarroll has taught \u201cThe Chemistry of Beer and Brewing\u201d since 2011. The Fermentation Science Institute was launched in August.\n\nThe proposed degree program will have to go through approval processes, both at SIU and the State Board of Higher Education, but McCarroll said he hopes to get the green light by the start of fall term this year.\n\nFor students like Ravenna, it\u2019s an exciting prospect. The Elmhurst native is studying restaurant management.\n\n\u201cIf you sell something, you should always know how it\u2019s made,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it never hurts to know how to make your own beer.\u201d\n\nAbout 30 minutes into the experiment, which challenged students to make a mash by heating a mixture of barley and water, Ravenna and Galindo\u2019s mixture reached its target temperature.\n\n\u201cI think I got it,\u201d said Galindo, a senior studying photojournalism and English. \u201cI think I dialed it perfectly. It\u2019s hovering right around 150.\u201d\n\nRavenna said learning the science behind brewing makes the craft that much more enjoyable.\n\n\u201cI love it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting that (the class) tells you the chemistry of an everyday item. You get to see how complex it is to make something that seems so simple.\u201d\n\n___\n\nSource: The (Carbondale) Southern Illinoisan, http://bit.ly/1yGhq29 .\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Southern Illinoisan, http://www.southernillinoisan.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "Giovanni Ravenna and Nick Galindo kept watch as the temperature crept toward 150 degrees.", "Author": "SARAH HALASZ GRAHAM", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Giovanni Ravenna and Nick Galindo kept watch as the temperature crept toward 150 degrees.", "title": "EXCHANGE: SIU professor pushing for fermentation program", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/feb/15/exchange-siu-professor-pushing-for-fermentation-pr/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/02/15/aab43d56eea0ee066d0f6a706700e3ac.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/02/15/aab43d56eea0ee066d0f6a706700e3ac.jpg", "title": "EXCHANGE: SIU professor pushing for fermentation program", "description": "Giovanni Ravenna and Nick Galindo kept watch as the temperature crept toward 150 degrees.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfc8e\"", "article_summary": "SIU students gathered in small teams around hot plates to watch chemical reactions in beakers.\nIt\u2019s all part of SIU\u2019s new Fermentation Science Institute, a group that supports education and research related to fermentation industries, such as craft brewing, distilling, cheese-making and pharmaceuticals.\nAnd now, McCarroll is making a push to start a fermentation degree program.\nThe Fermentation Science Institute was launched in August.\nMcCarroll said brewers of all sizes are looking for young professionals skilled in the art of fermentation, and SIU would become one of only a handful of colleges throughout the U.S. to offer a fermentation degree program."}
