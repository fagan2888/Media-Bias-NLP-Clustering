On this weekend’s Saturday Night Live, the late-night comedy troupe seized on President Obama‘s second-term headaches, big and small, for a commercial parody that markets “Paxil: Second Term Strength,” which they billed as “the only anti-depressant strong enough for an embattled second term.”

The spot ticks off the President’s current Obamacare woes, including former President Clinton’s admonition this week, and promises “you can get back on your feet and start running the country again. With Paxil you’ll feel like you’re giving a speech at a college campus in 2008, or getting bin Laden all over again.”

Paxil’s Second Term Strength treats a whole range of symptoms,” the ad continues, “like Benghazi. The NSA scandal. The IRS scandal. The AP scandal. The Petraeus scandal. That time Jay-Z and Beyonce went to Cuba. And, of course, Obamacare website problems.”

The pill comes with the disclaimer “Warning, Paxil is not covered by Obamacare. We promised that it would be, but it’s not. And for that, we apologize.”
