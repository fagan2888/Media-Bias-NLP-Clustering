Ted Cruz says the second amendment could be no more.\n\nAccording to the Des Moines Register, Cruz\u2019s comments came during a campaign stop in Iowa on Friday. The Republican presidential candidate remarked:\n\n\u201cOne more liberal justice and our right to keep and bear arms is taken away from us by an activist court.\u201d\n\nCruz didn\u2019t end his lambasting of the Court there. He continued, invoking veterans and the United Nations:\n\n\u201cOne more liberal justice and they begin sandblasting and bulldozing veterans memorials throughout this country. One more liberal justice and we lose our sovereignty to the United Nations and the World Court.\u201d\n\nDuring his campaign for the 2016 Republican nomination, Cruz has been highly critical of the Supreme Court. After the controversial Court rulings last summer that ruled in favor of same-sex marriage and the Affordable Care Act, Cruz called for the Court\u2019s justices to be subject to retention elections.\n\nRetention elections, Cruz said, would add accountability to the Court, which has wide, sweeping power and limited constitutional checks.\n\nCruz positions himself to be a \u201cfirebrand conservative,\u201d and it may be helping him in the polls. Following September\u2019s Republican debate, Cruz has seen a surge in support.\n\nA poll out Friday by the Des Moines Register and Bloomberg Politics placed Cruz in 3rd in Iowa among Republican-likely voters, behind first-place Ben Carson and second-place Donald Trump. That showing isn\u2019t far off from his national average, according to RealClearPolitics, who places Cruz fourth.", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "\"...sandblasting and bulldozing...\"", "published_at": "2015-10-25T11:32:24+00:00", "tags": "Politics", "og": {"site_name": "Independent Journal Review", "description": "\"...sandblasting and bulldozing...\"", "title": "Cruz Reveals What'll Happen to US If One More Liberal Justice Is Appointed to Supreme Court", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 650, "identifier": "http://www.ijreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/cruzz.jpg", "height": 436}, "updated_time": "2015-10-25T20:28:38-04:00", "url": "http://www.ijreview.com/2015/10/454121-ted-cruz-slams-scotus-says-nation-one-liberal-justice-away-losing-gun-rights/", "type": "article"}, "is_article": 1, "twitter": {"description": "\"...sandblasting and bulldozing...\"", "creator": "@chrisenloe", "image": "http://www.ijreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/cruzz.jpg", "title": "Cruz Reveals What'll Happen to US If One More Liberal Justice Is Appointed to Supreme Court", "site": "@injo", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Chris Enloe", "robots": "noodp", "DC.date.issued": "2015-10-25T11:32:24-04:00", "wp-categories": "27 1471", "p": {"domain_verify": "770b5b250556c52fa42a70dc373c541b"}, "fb": {"admins": 1116123001, "app_id": 251714254848821}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=878142436", "url": "http://www.ijreview.com/2015/10/454121-ted-cruz-slams-scotus-says-nation-one-liberal-justice-away-losing-gun-rights/", "wp-category-slugs": "elections, politics", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/injoreview/", "section": "Elections", "published_time": "2015-10-25T11:32:24-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-25T20:28:38-04:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/chrisdenloe"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "image": "http://www.ijreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/cruzz.jpg", "post_id": 454121, "is_https": 0}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fceb19\"", "article_summary": "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If the Supreme Court had just \u201cone more liberal justice,\u201d Sen.
