It paid 72.5% of health care premiums, such as for COBRA coverage, for eligible beneficiaries \u2014 those who lost their jobs due to foreign competition and retirees at least age 55 who worked for companies whose pension plans were taken over by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp.\n\nThe subsidy, included in a broad trade bill, H.R. 1314, which was approved Friday by the Senate on a 62-37 vote, also would be available to individuals enrolled in special trusts known as voluntary employee beneficiary associations, largely set up for the purpose of enabling enrollees to use the subsidies to help pay for VEBA-arranged coverage. Such VEBAs, for example, have been established for individuals who worked for steel companies that later failed.\n\nUnder the measure, the HCTC subsidy would be available through the end of 2019.\n\nIf the HCTC subsidy legislation wins final congressional approval, it could mean a big reduction in health care premiums for beneficiaries compared with obtaining coverage in public exchanges authorized by the health care reform law.\n\nThat is because the size of the HCTC subsidy would not be linked to beneficiaries' income. By contrast, Affordable Care Act premium subsidies for exchange coverage are based on beneficiaries' income, with the subsidies not available to those earning more than 400% of the federal poverty level which is set at $11,770 for an individual in 2015.\n\nThe House is expected to begin consideration of the measure next week.", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, minimal-ui"}, "article_summary": "The subsidy, known as the Health Coverage Tax Credit, expired at the end of 2013.\nIf the HCTC subsidy legislation wins final congressional approval, it could mean a big reduction in health care premiums for beneficiaries compared with obtaining coverage in public exchanges authorized by the health care reform law.\nThat is because the size of the HCTC subsidy would not be linked to beneficiaries' income.\nUnder the measure, the HCTC subsidy would be available through the end of 2019.\nSuch VEBAs, for example, have been established for individuals who worked for steel companies that later failed."}
