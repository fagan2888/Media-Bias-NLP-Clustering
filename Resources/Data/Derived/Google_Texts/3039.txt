UPDATED | Little more than one inch of snow fell in Central Park fell Tuesday, barely sticking to the streets but setting the snowfall record for Dec. 10.

Tuesday’s 1.4 inches of snow broke the previous record of 1.3 inches in 1932, according to the National Weather Service. Joe Pollina, a National Weather Service meteorologist, said snow began falling just before 8 a.m. in New York City and continued throughout much of the day.

In some areas, up to 3 inches fell, though roads remained “mostly wet,” he said.

The cold spell will continue this week, though snow is not expected in upcoming days. Temperatures aren’t expected to cross the freezing mark on Wednesday and will hover in the 20s on Thursday. More snow could fall Friday evening and continue into Saturday morning, Mr. Pollina said. Temperatures will then warm up to about 40 degrees, he said, or “the average for this time of year.”

Here are some scenes from around the city on Tuesday:
