It was sponsored by Seeds of Peace, a program that attempts to alleviate intercommunal tensions in Maine by bringing together immigrant, refugee and American-born students from high schools across the state for a two-week-long summer camp and other events throughout the year.\n\nStudents shared experiences of being stigmatized in school because they have learning disabilities or are not American-born. After each presentation, they met in small groups to discuss possible solutions to these problems.\n\n\u201cI was born in Georgia, raised in Maine,\u201d Muna Mohamed, a junior at Lewiston High School, told an audience of about 80 people. \u201cUp until sixth grade, I was considered not proficient in English when it was the only language I have ever spoken fluently. How does that work?\u201d\n\nThe students heard statements from lawmakers, including U.S. Sens. Angus King and Susan Collins and U.S. Reps. Mike Michaud and Chellie Pingree, as well as a rousing speech from gubernatorial candidate Eliot Cutler, but the real goal of the conference was for these students to educate their political leaders.\n\nNext fall, the Seeds of Peace students will present the governor, leaders of the Legislature and Maine\u2019s congressional delegation with a document outlining what they perceive to be the biggest issues facing the state\u2019s education system and proposed solutions. This document will update a similar proposal created by Seeds of Peace students in 2003 in response to Gov. John Baldacci\u2019s call for a charter to examine \u201cwhy young people are leaving our state.\u201d\n\nThis year, the students identified and focused on four topics: the economics of education, universal standards, students with disabilities and English language learner programs.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s super relevant to us,\u201d said Meredith Roderka, a senior at Dexter Regional High School. \u201cWe\u2019re the ones it\u2019s affecting \u2014 us and the teachers.\u201d\n\nFour students opened a discussion on the economics of education with a presentation that painted a dire picture of the cost of education from kindergarten to college.\n\n\u201cSeven out of every 10 students here will be an average of $29,400 in debt\u201d after graduating from college, said Sophie Warren, a senior at Catherine McAuley High School in Portland.\n\nJared Dumas said that though the city of Lewiston, where he goes to school, allocates 40 percent of its expenditures for education, money is still in short supply in that school district.\n\nCutler continued the economics discussion with a speech that received a standing ovation from the students.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s our problem in Maine: we\u2019re old and cold and poor,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf we want to get younger,\u201d he went on, \u201cthe first thing we\u2019re going to have to do is get smarter about immigrants \u2026 we need policies to get more immigrants to come to Maine.\u201d\n\nHe added that the cost of higher education, which he said is increasing faster than the cost of health care, is keeping Maine students from achieving a degree after high school.\n\nCutler\u2019s presence at the event was significant to the students.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s important for kids to hear people like Eliot Cutler speak and know that there are important people looking at this and scrutinizing it,\u201d Roderka said, referring to the document that will be finished in the fall.\n\nThe conversation later shifted to standards-based education, a form of teaching and grading that all Maine high schools will be required to use in the 2014-2015 school year. The model calls on students to master a set of skills in order to graduate from high school, and moves emphasis away from a traditional model of letter grades and credits.\n\nAfter another student presentation, the audience grilled a panel of educators that included Portland Public Schools Superintendent Emmanuel Caulk, Casco Bay High School principal Derek Pierce and Dexter Regional High School teacher Lisa Cronin, all of whom have had varying degrees of experience with standards-based education.\n\nThe students wanted to know:\n\n\u2014 What happens if a student doesn\u2019t meet the standard?\n\n\u2014 How will standards-based education affect students with disabilities?\n\n\u2014 Doesn\u2019t standards-based education benefit self-motivated students and leave behind everyone else?\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all living in a flawed system and I don\u2019t see much harm in trying to move to a better system,\u201d said Pierce, whose school has been using a standards-based system since it was founded in 2005.\n\nEach of the student participants at Saturday\u2019s event had attended the summer camp at Seeds of Peace or will attend this year. Students that show strong leadership skills are selected by their teachers to apply to the program. Their applications are evaluated by Tim Wilson, the program\u2019s director, and administrators in the Seeds of Peace central office in New York, before they are invited to camp.\n\n\u201cThis is not typical of a lot of things that go on in Maine,\u201d said Wilson. \u201cIt\u2019s their dialogue. We put parameters on it, but it\u2019s their dialogue.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "PORTLAND, Maine \u2014 The lack of funding for public schools, the cost of higher education and a dysfunctional program for English language learners were some of the problems more than 50 students, representing 13 schools from Dexter to Scarborough, tackled Saturday at the Portland Public Library.
