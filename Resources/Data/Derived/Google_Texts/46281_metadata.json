These two basic responses to a perceived threat served our ancestors well, but in today\u2019s modern world most people do not face life-or-death situations in their day-to-day that engages their fight-or-flight instincts.\n\nExcept, of course, when it comes to the stock and bond markets, where, at least according to many commentators, investors are constantly fleeing to safety, or selling first and asking questions later.\n\nThe fight response might be more appropriate, though. Consider that the U.S. stock market has been in a bull market for more than six years despite myriad Wall Street \u201cscares.\u201d\n\nHere is an incomplete list of perceived threats that were said to have forced some investors to flee:\n\nAffordable Care Act (or Obamacare, if you wish): Passage would kill the health sector\n\nArab Spring: Middle East chaos\n\nChina slowing: Global demand would suffer\n\nComparisons with 1929: The charts say Depression\n\nCyberattacks: Corporations aren\u2019t safe\n\nCyprus: Bank defaults would lead to global disaster\n\nEbola: A global pandemic\n\nFlash Crash: The markets are unsafe\n\n\u2018Grexit\u2019 Parts 1 and 2: The demise of the EU and the euro\n\nIsis: A world in chaos\n\nLibya: More Middle East chaos\n\nQuantitative easing: Leading to hyper-inflation\n\nSequestration: The U.S. government in chaos\n\nTapering: Without stimulus the economy would crater\n\nUkraine, Crimea and Russia: Chaos and war-mongering\n\nU.S. debt rating downgrade: The U.S. is in trouble\n\nU.S. Government shutdown: The U.S. is in trouble\n\nClearly, the list of reasons to avoid the stock market is ever-expanding, and yet investors have been much better off staying in the markets.\n\nFlying to safety is just another way of saying that investors are timing the markets \u2014 something has happened, and they are trying to get out of the market before it gets worse, with the idea of getting back in after the danger is gone.\n\nOnly it rarely works that way. As the list above shows, predicting what will actually spark the next bear market is not an easy task. And don\u2019t forget that to be successful in this endeavor, you need to not only avoid the danger, but get back into the market afterward.\n\nYou\u2019re better off moving away from the all-or-nothing mind-set of fight or flight. Taking flight hasn\u2019t served investors in the long run, but sticking to your long-term plan shouldn\u2019t be a fight either. Rather, the right response is usually to be patient and realize that the apparent threat often is not as dangerous as first perceived.\n\nStill, the flight-to-safety instinct is a strong one, and we eventually will see another bear market, so let\u2019s discuss (and dispel) common funds investors turn to for safety. These flight-to-safety funds, when added to a stock-heavy portfolio, can help make it easier to stick to the plan when your instincts tell you to fly.\n\nShock-Absorbing Funds\n\nVanguard Intermediate-Term Treasury (MUTF: VFITX ): There are plenty of naysayers and doubters, but until proven otherwise, U.S. Treasuries remain the flight-to-safety asset of choice. You\u2019ll get the most bang for your buck in terms of protection from falling stock markets in long maturity Treasuries.\n\nConsider that Vanguard Extended Duration ETF (NYSEARCA: EDV ) gained 55% in 2008 as Vanguard 500 Index (MUTF: VFINX ) lost 37%. Or take the third quarter of 2011, when Vanguard 500 Index lost 13.9%, but Extended Duration Treasury ETF gained a whopping 52.7%.\n\nThat\u2019s certainly a lot of return to offset declining stock prices, but those returns can slice the other way. Extended Duration Treasury ETF declined 35.7% in 2009 and dropped 17% in just the three months ending July 2013. Not exactly what I would call a \u201csafe\u201d holding.\n\nIf you are looking for Treasury bonds to insulate your portfolio, I\u2019d look to Vanguard Intermediate-Term Treasury, which has regularly provided positive returns when stocks fell but without the wild ride of long-maturity bonds.\n\nNext Page", "article_metadata": {"description": "You can do well by adding a little exposure to \"safe\" funds invested in Treasuries and other bonds.
