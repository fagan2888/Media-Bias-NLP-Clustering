Some left-leaning media figures have blamed the cut for Kansas\u2019 still lagging economy and plunging deficit.\n\nKansas Policy Institute President Dave Trabert said the media\u2019s claims are solely political rather than \u201chonest economic discussions\u201d regarding Kansas\u2019 lagging economy. Trabert contested the notion that the tax cuts are to blame, pointing to the government\u2019s inability to \u201cfinish the job and get spending under control\u201d as the primary reason for the state\u2019s slow economic growth.\n\n\u201cKansas didn\u2019t take the steps to make government operate efficiently,\u201d Trabert said. \u201cThe states that spend less need to tax less\u2014those are the states that grow more. It really comes down to that better service, better price mentality.\u201d\n\nRep. Richard Carlson, R-Kans., called the media\u2019s assertions \u201cdisingenuous,\u201d saying the 18 months the cuts have been in place isn\u2019t long enough for others to judge whether the reforms are working. Carlson said the state\u2019s long-held liberal economic policies, including its high taxes, are also partially to blame for the lag.\n\nJonathan Williams, tax and fiscal policy director at the American Legislative Exchange Council, compared the nine states without income taxes to the nine states with the highest income taxes, and found that those without an income tax have 2.5 times higher population growth, 1.5 times higher GDP growth and 2.6 times payroll growth. This, Williams said, undermines the media\u2019s conclusions that reduced income taxes stifle economic growth.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve already identified far more that needs to be done so that we can finish the job of tax reform without any tax increases,\u201d Trabert said. \u201cThere certainly is an adjustment that needs to be made, but that adjustment goes back to finishing the job and going back to tax reform.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Conservatives participated in a conference call to refute media claims that Kansas\u2019 tax reductions have contributed to the downfall of the state\u2019s economy.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Conservatives participated in a conference call to refute media claims that Kansas\u2019 tax reductions have contributed to the downfall of the state\u2019s economy.", "title": "Conservative Groups Respond to Liberal Criticism of Kansas Tax Cuts", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/140715_Kansas_Johnson.jpg", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1zGuk4o"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Conservatives participated in a conference call to refute media claims that Kansas\u2019 tax reductions have contributed to the downfall of the state\u2019s economy.", "title": "Conservative Groups Respond to Liberal Criticism of Kansas Tax Cuts", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/140715_Kansas_Johnson.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Economy", "tag": "taxes", "published_time": "2014-07-15T17:27:10+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Tax cuts, Kansas, Sam Brownback, Richard Carlson, ALEC"}, "article_summary": "Conservative groups came together for a conference call Thursday, arguing against left-leaning media claims that Kansas\u2019 steep income tax reductions have contributed to the downfall of the state\u2019s economy.\nKansas Governor Sam Brownback slashed the income tax in 2012 in an effort to reverse the state\u2019s 15 year trend of trailing national economic averages.\nKansas Policy Institute President Dave Trabert said the media\u2019s claims are solely political rather than \u201chonest economic discussions\u201d regarding Kansas\u2019 lagging economy.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve already identified far more that needs to be done so that we can finish the job of tax reform without any tax increases,\u201d Trabert said.\nThis, Williams said, undermines the media\u2019s conclusions that reduced income taxes stifle economic growth."}
