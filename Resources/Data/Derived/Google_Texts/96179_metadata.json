Barra said the company is changing how it handles defect investigations and recalls.\n\nRelated: GM's Mounting Killer Car Problem\n\nIn the last two months, GM has recalled more than 3.1 million vehicles in the United States and other markets. The actions started with last month\u2019s recall of more than 1.6 million vehicles for faulty ignition switches. The latest recalls cover airbag wiring harnesses, brake parts and other components across several models.\n\nThe Detroit automaker said on Monday it would take a $300 million charge in the first quarter, primarily to cover the costs related to the ignition-switch recall and the three new recalls.\n\nBarra previously apologized for GM\u2019s failure to catch the faulty ignition switches sooner. In Monday\u2019s video, she said GM is \"conducting an intense review of our internal processes and will have more developments to announce as we move forward.\"\n\nThe decade-long process that led to last month\u2019s ignition-switch recall of such older GM models as the 2005-2007 Chevrolet Cobalt and 2003-2007 Saturn Ion has led to government criminal and civil investigations, congressional hearings and class-action lawsuits in the United States and Canada. All ask why GM took so long to address a problem it has said first came to its attention in 2001.\n\nBarra said on Monday that the company was working with the supplier of the ignition switches, Delphi Automotive, to add a second production line for replacement parts and that customers would receive a detailed notice by mail during the second week of April.\n\nThe latest recalls cover more than 1.5 million newer crossover utility vehicles, luxury sedans and full-size vans. While there were reports of engine compartment fires in two dealer-owned Cadillac XTS sedans, the company said it has received no reports of accidents or injuries related to the three new recalls.\n\nRelated: GM's Initial Switch Problems: The 6 Models Being Recalled\n\nGM said the latest recalls include 1.18 million mid-sized crossovers to repair an issue that could lead to the nondeployment of side airbags. It said it will repair the wiring harness of seat-mounted side airbags.\n\nAffected are some 2008-2009 and all 2010-2013 Buick Enclave and GMC Acadia crossovers, some 2009 and all 2010-2013 Chevrolet Traverses and some 2008-2009 and all 2010 Saturn Outlooks. Most of the vehicles were sold in the United States, but some are in Canada and Mexico.\n\nThe automaker also is recalling 303,000 Chevrolet Express and GMC Savana full-size vans to replace plastic material in the passenger instrument panel to meet federal head-impact crash standards for unbelted passengers, a spokesman said.\n\nAffected are vans from model years 2009 through 2014 that are rated to carry up to 10,000 pounds including the vehicle\u2019s own weight, the spokesman said. Most were sold in the United States, but also in Canada, Mexico and other markets.\n\nIn the XTS, a brake booster pump wiring issue can lead to overheating, melting of plastic parts and a possible engine compartment fire, the spokesman said. There were two reports of fires in unsold cars on dealer lots in June and September last year as well as two cases of melted components.\n\nRelated: Did the Obama White House Protect GM?\n\nAffected are 63,900 of the 2013 and 2014 luxury sedans, mostly in the United States, but also in Canada, Mexico and a small number in the Middle East, the spokesman said.\n\nCLASS ACTION\n\nGM said the new recalls resulted from Barra\u2019s push for a comprehensive internal safety review following the ignition-switch recall.\n\n\"I asked our team to redouble our efforts on our pending product reviews, bring them forward and resolve them quickly,\" Barra said in a statement on Monday.\n\nOn Friday, the automaker was hit with what appeared to be the first U.S. class action related to the ignition-switch recall, as customers claimed their vehicles lost value because of the ignition switch problems. The proposed class action was filed in a Texas federal court. Other plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers say they are preparing to file similar cases in the coming days.\n\nGM shares closed 1.6 percent higher at $34.63 on Monday on the New York Stock Exchange. Last week, the shares fell 10 percent.\n\nRelated: GM Faces New Pressure from Outraged Consumers\n\nAnalysts have called the media coverage of the ignition-switch recall and resulting sell-off of GM stock \"overdone.\"\n\n\"We think much is being made in the media about recent recall headlines, but in short, we believe GM is doing a good job balancing its ongoing investigation while taking steps to prevent further vehicle related incidents by proactively announcing new vehicle recalls,\" Stifel analyst James Albertine said in a research note on Monday.\n\n\"There is clearly a target on GM\u2019s back, in our view, given its highly publicized government-sponsored bailout and its industry-leading market share position.\"\n\nBarclays analyst Brian Johnson said the risk of market-share loss increased because the latest recalls include newer models on dealer lots.\n\nRBC Capital Markets analyst Joseph Spak said the charge for the recalls worked out to less than $100 per vehicle, but the greater risk was the potential damage to GM\u2019s reputation and whether that would force the company to offer higher incentives to customers to defend its U.S. market share.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "General Motors Co announced new recalls of 1.5 million vehicles on Monday and in a vir", "title": "GM Recalls More Cars, Promises Intense Review", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/03/18/GM-Recalls-More-Cars-Promises-Intense-Review", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/Chevy%20Cobalt.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/03/18/GM-Recalls-More-Cars-Promises-Intense-Review", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/Chevy%20Cobalt.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "General Motors Co announced new recalls of 1.5 million vehicles on Monday and in a vir", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd10d6\"", "article_summary": "CLASS ACTIONGM said the new recalls resulted from Barra\u2019s push for a comprehensive internal safety review following the ignition-switch recall.\nRelated: GM Faces New Pressure from Outraged ConsumersAnalysts have called the media coverage of the ignition-switch recall and resulting sell-off of GM stock \"overdone.\"\nRelated: GM's Mounting Killer Car ProblemIn the last two months, GM has recalled more than 3.1 million vehicles in the United States and other markets.\nMost were sold in the United States, but also in Canada, Mexico and other markets.\nThe actions started with last month\u2019s recall of more than 1.6 million vehicles for faulty ignition switches."}
