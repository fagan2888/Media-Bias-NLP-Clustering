(Photo: Emily Lansing/Wildcats Media.)\n\nA home-school student from Baton Rouge was the winner of Louisiana College\u2019s prestigious Clyde and Elizabeth Smith Scholarship Competition on Saturday.\n\nChaz Morgan beat out 13 other invitees to win the scholarship that covers every expense at LC, including tuition, fees, books, residence and meals. Each student who competed also received a substantial scholarship offer for being among the top applicants of the 2015 freshman class.\n\n\u201cI really wanted to win because it would be such an honor to be able to represent the school,\u201d Morgan said. \u201cWhen they announced my name, I said, \u2018Thank you, Lord.\u2019\u201d\n\nMorgan, whose parents are Charles and Carletta Morgan, is the fifth home-schooled student to win the competition in the last seven years. He plans to major in pre-law at LC and has set a goal to one day become a judge. His sister, Kaeli, is also a sophomore at LC and is majoring in pre-med.\n\nThe Smith Scholarship began in the 1970s after an endowment donation from Tom and Beverly Dunham to honor Beverly\u2019s mother, Elizabeth Smith. To be invited to compete, a student must have applied for admission to LC and scored a 28 or better on the ACT.\n\nDuring the actual competition, students went through panel interviews where they answered questions about their academic accomplishments as well as their Christian faith.\n\nMorgan said he had developed an interest in attending LC a number of years ago when he represented his church youth group in state Bible drills held on the campus.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the perfect place for me,\u201d Morgan said. \u201cBeing home-schooled, I\u2019ve been given a firm foundation and taught in Christianity to prepare for my life in the world. LC is just a great place for me to come.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: http://www.thetowntalk.com/story/news/local/2015/02/01/baton-rouge-student-wins-la-colleges-smith-scholarship/22698805/", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Chaz Morgan earns scholarship that covers tuition, fees, books, residence and meals.", "og": {"site_name": "thetowntalk.com", "description": "Chaz Morgan earns scholarship that covers tuition, fees, books, residence and meals.", "title": "Baton Rouge student wins La.
