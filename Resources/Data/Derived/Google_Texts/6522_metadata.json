Bush, Iraq, Iraq war, Michael Moore, Paul Wolfowitz, The World According to Dick Cheney, Vietnam, Vietnam War, News, Politics News\n\nNeither the film world nor the political world paid much attention to R. J. Cutler\u2019s Showtime documentary \u201cThe World According to Dick Cheney,\u201d released in the dim and distant days of March 2013, when we thought Cheney had departed public life for good. I suppose the general reaction was \u201cOh Jesus Christ, not that guy again!\u201d Even the tone of Cutler\u2019s film, built around 20 hours of interviews with the most \u201cconsequential\u201d vice president in American history \u2013 Cheney\u2019s word, but he\u2019s probably right \u2013 was faintly elegiac. This guy changed the world, whatever you think of him, and it was time to capture his portrait before he sailed for the other shore.\n\nLeaving aside the question of whether Dick Cheney can ever experience physical death \u2013 doesn\u2019t the power of the One Ring more or less make you immortal? \u2013 he\u2019s back. This week Cheney was in the news at the head of an army of neocon zombies, seemingly reanimated from the foreign-policy tomb of the Bush II administration, leading the ideological charge for yet more war in Iraq. Or rather, since even Dick Cheney cannot possibly believe that is likely, for the principle that all blame for the actual or impending Iraqi disaster should be assigned to the cut-and-run pussies of the current administration, and none at all to the one that lied its way into the whole catastrophic misadventure in the first place.\n\nWatching the embarrassing video clip of Cheney, in his Wyoming rancher drag, as he and failed-candidate daughter Liz Cheney announce their hawkish new anti-Obama foreign-policy nonprofit, brought me back to a key moment in Cutler\u2019s film. It\u2019s really just a biographical footnote, midway through Cheney\u2019s extraordinary rise from alcoholic semi-employment in Rock Springs, Wyoming, at age 23 to being Gerald Ford\u2019s White House chief of staff at age 34, but it speaks volumes. As unlikely as this sounds, Cheney spent 1968, that watershed year in American political and cultural history, as a graduate student in political science at the University of Wisconsin, one of the most radicalized campuses in the country.\n\nThere was apparently a small group of conservative poli-sci types in Madison at that time, and I bet that wasn\u2019t fun. Protests and demonstrations against American foreign policy and the Vietnam War were almost a weekly occurrence at Wisconsin during Cheney\u2019s brief stint there. There was a student general strike in the fall of 1967, and another one in the spring of 1969. May of 1968 saw the first of two campus bombings that were presumably the work of the Weather Underground. This fervid atmosphere of chaos and dissent was unfamiliar and distressing to a crew-cut Young Republican from the Mountain West, and Cheney quietly says that the whole experience pushed him further to the right. It\u2019s as close as he ever comes to a moment of self-revelation in \u201cThe World According to Dick Cheney,\u201d unless you count his obvious man-crush on Donald Rumsfeld, his friend, mentor and ideological soulmate.\n\nI think that\u2019s important for several reasons. First of all, Cheney has seen the other side of American political life up close, and he hated it. More important still, like the other architects of the Bush administration\u2019s disastrous foreign policy, he was trying to make up for what he saw as the sins of the past. Cheney and Paul Wolfowitz and Douglas Feith and Bill Kristol and the rest of those shameless clowns who were so profoundly wrong about the initial Iraq war (and everything else) are understandably eager to rewrite history such that they are its heroes and its misunderstood prophets. But the history that oppresses those guys, and the entire imperialist intelligentsia they represent, goes back a lot further than Saddam Hussein and 9/11. They\u2019re still haunted by a different specter: the American empire\u2019s Waterloo moment in Vietnam, more than 40 years ago, and the social discord it produced in places like Madison and Berkeley and Chicago and New York. For them, the entire Iraq conflict was almost a stand-in for the real thing, a delusional salve applied to an old psychic wound. Give them Marty McFly\u2019s time-traveling DeLorean and they\u2019d go whizzing right past Baghdad and head for Hanoi, circa 1969, with a thermonuclear device in tow.\n\nI know exactly how irritating it is to be told that American politics keeps replaying the ideological wars of the 1960s, having been barraged with that rhetoric by veterans of the New Left for most of my life. It\u2019s less and less accurate as time goes on, and the right\u2019s persistent efforts to identify Barack Obama as a \u201960s-style radical would be funny if they weren\u2019t acutely painful. Whatever his flaws and merits, Obama was a small child during the 1960s, and one who largely grew up overseas. He genuinely was not molded by the politics of that era. But when it comes to the Bush-Cheney Iraq campaign, the entire enterprise was contaminated from the outset with post-Vietnam stress disorder. American conservatives of Cheney\u2019s generation are caught in an evil and bloodthirsty variation on \u201cGroundhog Day\u201d: They\u2019ll keep fighting and refighting Vietnam until they die, and it\u2019s never going to turn out right.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Cheney and his neocon cabal want to go back to Iraq \u2013 but they're really fighting Vietnam all over again", "author": "Andrew O'Hehir", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Cheney and his neocon cabal want to go back to Iraq \u2013 but they're really fighting Vietnam all over again", "title": "Dick Cheney, Iraq and the ghosts of Vietnam", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/06/21/dick_cheney_iraq_and_the_ghosts_of_vietnam/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/dick_cheney_vietnam.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Cheney and his neocon cabal want to go back to Iraq \u2013 but they're really fighting Vietnam all over again", "creator": "@andohehir", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/dick_cheney_vietnam.jpg", "title": "Dick Cheney, Iraq and the ghosts of Vietnam", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Dick Cheney, Iraq and the ghosts of Vietnam", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Bill Kristol, Dick Cheney, Douglas Feith, Editor's Picks, George W.
