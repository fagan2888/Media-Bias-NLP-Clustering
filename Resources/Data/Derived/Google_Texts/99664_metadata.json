For defendants with one prior, their sentence can be doubled. If a defendant facing a ten-year minimum sentence has two prior drug convictions, the prosecutors can transform his sentence into life. The decision to use \u201cenhancements\u201d is in the prosecutor\u2019s sole discretion and the courts have no choice but to impose the egregiously harsh enhanced sentences.\n\nTake Stephanie Yvette George, one of the eight. She was convicted in 1997 because, as the judge said, she was the \u201cbag holder and money holder\u201d for crack-dealing boyfriends. She had been looking at a ten-year mandatory minimum sentence on crack conspiracy charges \u2013 already too severe a punishment for a bit player in the drug business. But prosecutors chose to increase her sentence to life because she had two earlier convictions for selling a total of $160 worth of crack \u2013 offenses for which she served nine months in a work-release program. Because there is no parole in the federal system, her life sentence was a sentence to die behind bars.\n\nAs George\u2019s case illustrates, even a small-time drug offender with some petty prior convictions can be sentenced to life if a prosecutor decides to trigger the sentencing enhancement. Because mandatory sentences take no account of an offender's role in a crime, ten years is the minimum most street level dealers, bit players, and even couriers face unless they can secure a lower sentence through a plea agreement. Moreover, the prior convictions that turn ten years into a life sentence could have happened long ago, the defendant may never have been sentenced to prison (e.g. the sentence was for probation), and the crimes could have been as minor as simple possession of marijuana for personal use.\n\nSome prosecutors use the enhancement provision in every case in which it's applicable. Most, however, use the threat of enhancements to strong-arm defendants into pleading guilty -- a threat they make good on if the defendant refuses. As one former prosecutor told me, \"We would only invoke [the enhancement]\u2026to penalize a defendant for the audacity of going to trial.\"\n\nTwo of the other prisoners in the commuted cases \u2013 Ricky Eugene Patterson and Billy Ray Wheelock, who both had prior drug convictions \u2013 refused to plead guilty. Patterson was indicted for conspiracy to sell 10 ounces of crack and faced a ten-year mandatory sentence. When he insisted on going to trial, prosecutors sought a sentencing enhancement for him based on two earlier convictions for simple possession of crack. Wheelock, too, was looking at a ten-year mandatory minimum sentence, and he too insisted on going to trial. The day jury selection in his trial began, prosecutors filed a notice to enhance his sentence based on two priors. Both Patterson and Wheelock were convicted and sentenced to life behind bars \u2013 not because of their drug crimes, but because they refused to plead guilty.\n\nProsecutors in the case of Ezel Gilbert, another of the commuted cases, sought a life sentence based on three prior petty drug crimes. Gilbert agreed to plead guilty and the prosecutors withdrew the sentencing enhancement. Although he still received a 24-year sentence, by foregoing his right to trial he avoided life without parole.\n\nPunishment should fit the crime \u2013 not the defendant\u2019s willingness to plead. No one knows how many men and women have foregone trial to avoid horrific sentencing enhancements nor how many are serving time in federal prisons with disproportionately severe sentences because they refused to plead. Our research into plea bargains in federal drug cases revealed prosecutors often see sentencing enhancements as a chip to be played during plea negotiations \u2013 a chip that can ruin lives. Among those eligible for a sentencing enhancement because of prior convictions, those who go to trial are 8.4 times more likely to have received the sentencing enhancements than those who plead \u2013 statistics that confirm prosecutors are more likely to pursue enhancements for people who exercise their right to trial.\n\nIn August 2013, Attorney General Eric Holder Eric H. HolderEric Holder to headline fundraiser for Clinton The Hill's 12:30 Report The Hill's 12:30 Report MORE instructed federal prosecutors to avoid seeking sentencing enhancements in drug cases unless the circumstances warranted such severe sanctions. But he provided such broad criteria for determining whether such circumstances exist that, as Judge John Gleeson of the Eastern District of New York has pointed out, any capable prosecutor who wants to seek the enhancement can justify doing so.\n\nThe attorney general should prohibit prosecutors from threatening or seeking greatly increased sentences simply because defendants refuse to plead. But as long as the drug sentencing enhancement provision remains on the books, prosecutors are likely to use it. Congress should abolish the provision as part of a broader reform to the regime of mandatory minimum sentencing laws that have sent tens of thousands to prison with sentences that are neither just nor fair.\n\nFellner is senior advisor to the U.S. Program of Human Rights Watch and author of the recent Human Rights Watch report, An Offer You Can\u2019t Refuse: How Federal Prosecutors Force Drug Defendants to Plead Guilty.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "If a defendant facing a ten-year minimum sentence has two prior drug convictions, the prosecutors can transform his sentence into life.", "description": "If a defendant facing a ten-year minimum sentence has two prior drug convictions, the prosecutors can transform his sentence into life.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Congress Blog"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "If a defendant facing a ten-year minimum sentence has two prior drug convictions, the prosecutors can transform his sentence into life.", "title": "Congress should scrap drug sentencing 'enhancements'", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/judicial/195118-congress-should-scrap-drug-sentencing-enhancements", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-02T12:18:14-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-02T12:18-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/judicial/195118-congress-should-scrap-drug-sentencing-enhancements", "dcterms.date": "2014-01-13T13:00-05:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Joe Picard", "author": "Jamie Fellner", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",Eric Holder,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-01-13T13:00:00-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-02T12:18:14-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/judicial/195118-congress-should-scrap-drug-sentencing-enhancements", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "If a defendant facing a ten-year minimum sentence has two prior drug convictions, the prosecutors can transform his sentence into life.", "card": "summary", "title": "Congress should scrap drug sentencing 'enhancements'"}, "dcterms.title": "Congress should scrap drug sentencing 'enhancements'"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc8e3\"", "article_summary": "If a defendant facing a ten-year minimum sentence has two prior drug convictions, the prosecutors can transform his sentence into life.\nBut as long as the drug sentencing enhancement provision remains on the books, prosecutors are likely to use it.\nBecause there is no parole in the federal system, her life sentence was a sentence to die behind bars.\nTwo of the other prisoners in the commuted cases \u2013 Ricky Eugene Patterson and Billy Ray Wheelock, who both had prior drug convictions \u2013 refused to plead guilty.\nWheelock, too, was looking at a ten-year mandatory minimum sentence, and he too insisted on going to trial."}
