This can open the door to antibiotic-resistant infections, such as C. difficile, which can be particularly devastating to residents of long-term care (LTC) facilities, many of whom have weakened immune systems.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC) in September issued new recommendations asking all nursing homes to take measures to improve antibiotic prescribing practices, calling it a national priority. \u201cSuperbugs that are hard to treat pose a health risk to all Americans, particularly the elderly whose bodies don\u2019t fight infection as well,\u201d said CDC Director Tom Frieden, MD, MPH, in issuing the recommendations. \u201cOne way to keep older Americans safe from these superbugs is to make sure antibiotics are used appropriately all the time and everywhere, particularly in nursing homes.\u201d\n\nThe Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) also recently proposed a rule that would require LTC facilities to incorporate an antibiotic stewardship program into their infection prevention and control program.\n\nWhy now?\n\nPhenelle Segal, RN, CIC, president of Infection Control Consulting Services, a consulting firm offering infection prevention services to healthcare facilities including nursing homes, says she believes the Affordable Care Act is part of the reason this issue is coming to the forefront right now. \u201cAcross the continuum of care, beginning with acute care facilities, moving into ambulatory surgery and then targeting nursing homes, the Affordable Care Act has been instrumental in driving change in practice for the benefit of patient safety. A large component of the Affordable Care Act that attempts to improve patient safety has been in infection prevention,\u201d she says.\n\nIn March, the Obama administration released a national action plan to combat antibiotic resistant bacteria, and the new CDC recommendations are a result of that plan. \u201cThe elderly are definitely at increased risk because they frequently get aspiration pneumonia and urinary tract infections which require antibiotic therapy. Frequent antibiotic therapy predisposes them to infections such as C.diff,\u201d explains Segal.\n\nCreate a monitoring program\n\nEvery nursing home, regardless of its size, needs to develop an antibiotic monitoring program that monitors the use and the misuse of antibiotics among residents, according to Segal. She suggests they start small when building these programs. \u201cThis is a huge undertaking and it needs to be tailored to the individual facility, taking into consideration the size, available resources and antibiotic usage. All facilities need to implement one or two steps at the beginning and then gradually add new strategies over time,\u201d she explains.\n\nIdentify a core team\n\nOne of the first steps nursing homes should take is identifying a core team of people who will be responsible for developing and implementing the antibiotic stewardship program. \u201cIt cannot be handed to one individual, as successful programs happen when teamwork is present,\u201d says Segal.\n\nAt a minimum, the team should include:\n\nA physician champion\n\nA pharmacy champion\n\nAn administrative representative\n\nA nursing representative, preferably with some experience in infection prevention\n\nA microbiology expert from the laboratory\n\nExamine the data\n\nThe second step is to look at the healthcare-associated infection data for the facility to identify infections or colonized residents and the organisms that are associated with the facility, particularly those that result in the use of antibiotics, and examine their multi-drug resistant organism patterns. \u201cDo they have a problem with C. difficile infection, for example? Do they know their multi-drug resistant organism rates, such as Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs), and Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE),\u201d she asks. \u201cThey need to identify their areas of weakness with respect to healthcare-associated infections that could possibly be associated with the misuse or overuse of antimicrobials.\u201d\n\nCoordinate usage\n\nThe next step is for facilities to coordinate using certain antibiotics for certain infections, Segal said. They can develop \u201cbundles\u201d that make sure the medications are used in a consistent manner. \u201cThe team needs to look at the dose, the duration and why they are using an antibiotic, so that they are not used in a way that encourages drug resistance to develop,\u201d says Segal.\n\n\u201cUrinary tract infections (UTIs) are a good example of a condition in which these steps can be effective, because they are a frequent cause of antibiotic misuse,\u201d she said. \u201cThe key to treating or not treating a UTI lies in how the culture is done and how the test results are interpreted. Collection of urine for culture by the nursing staff and the microbiology lab plays a critical role,\u201d she says. \u201cA lot of residents develop asymptomatic bacteriuria\u2014there are no symptoms consistent with bacteria in the urine.\u201d\n\nEssentially, residents who are not exhibiting symptoms of a UTI should not even be cultured, however, if they are, treatment with antibiotics needs to be thought out carefully as asymptomatic bacteriuria results in a lot of unnecessary antibiotic use.", "article_metadata": {"com.silverpop.brandeddomains": "www.pages04.net,assistedhousingfinancialinsider.com,assistedhousinginsider.com,commercialleaselawinsider.com,constructionsuperconference.com,efaconference.com,secure.rhq.com,secure2.rhq.com,www.addictionpro.com,www.apartmentlawinsider.com,www.assistedhousinginsider.com,www.behavioral.net,www.commercialleaselawinsider.com,www.commercialtenantsleaseinsider.com,www.communityassociationinsider.com,www.constructionsuperconference.com,www.entjournal.com,www.environmentsforaging.com,www.etouches.com,www.fairhousingcoach.com,www.hcd11.com,www.healthcare-informatics.com,www.healthcarebuildingideas.com,www.healthcaredesignmagazine.com,www.herdjournal.com,www.ihealthtran.com,www.landlordvtenant.com,www.ltlmagazine.com,www.nycapartmentlaw.com,www.taxcredithousinginsider.com,www.vendomegrp.com,www.vendomerealestatemedia.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "com.silverpop.cothost": "engage4.silverpop.com"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1d6e\"", "article_summary": "A large component of the Affordable Care Act that attempts to improve patient safety has been in infection prevention,\u201d she says.\n\u201cThe elderly are definitely at increased risk because they frequently get aspiration pneumonia and urinary tract infections which require antibiotic therapy.\nCreate a monitoring programEvery nursing home, regardless of its size, needs to develop an antibiotic monitoring program that monitors the use and the misuse of antibiotics among residents, according to Segal.\n\u201cUrinary tract infections (UTIs) are a good example of a condition in which these steps can be effective, because they are a frequent cause of antibiotic misuse,\u201d she said.\nThe Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC) in September issued new recommendations asking all nursing homes to take measures to improve antibiotic prescribing practices, calling it a national priority."}
