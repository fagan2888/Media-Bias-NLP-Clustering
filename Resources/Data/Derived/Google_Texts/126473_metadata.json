What do we have to lose? Take the risk,\u2019\u201d Pfeiffer said.\n\nWhen asked how he managed his personal fear of failure, Pfeiffer was adamant that the ability to take risks is a vital skill.\n\n\u201cIf you work hard, are a good colleague and you\u2019re smart, you will bounce back from failure,\u201d Pfeiffer said.\n\nAlthough Pfeiffer was a loyal Obama staffer, he did have his moments of doubt as the campaign progressed.\n\n\u201cYou live in perpetual fear of the other shoe dropping and it all falling apart,\u201d Pfeiffer said. \u201cEvery single day when the polls would come back in the three weeks leading up to it, I would want to throw up thinking, \u2018Is this the day we are going to hear something that is going to say we aren\u2019t actually going to win?\u2019\u201d\n\nOnce Obama was elected, Pfeiffer began working at the White House, where he witnessed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, the killing of Osama bin Laden in 2011 and the recent government shutdown in 2013. Pfeiffer\u2019s best memory of working at the White House was when the Affordable Care Act passed in 2010, as it had been a specific project of his for a year and a half.\n\n\u201cIt had lived and died a thousand times,\u201d Pfeiffer said. \u201cHealth care was something that others had tried and failed, and it said to me that if we can do this, then Obama is a different sort of president, a transformation president.\u201d\n\nSince Obama\u2019s re-election, Pfeiffer has taken into account how decisions will impact Obama\u2019s legacy.\n\n\u201cHe wants to be seen as someone who did everything he possibly could to help make this country more compassionate and more fair,\u201d Pfeiffer said.\n\nIn March, Pfeiffer left the White House and became a CNN contributor. He believes that the millennial generation of voters, who are more concerned with public interests than party labels, will change the face of politics.\n\n\u201cThe incentive structure for compromise will change when Republicans and Democrats have to compete for the same voters,\u201d Pfeiffer said. \u201cI am very optimistic about future politics; the key thing is for more young people to get involved and stay involved and not get turned off by the moment we are in.\u201d\n\nKevin Lo (COL \u201916) said that he enjoyed the intimacy with which Pfeiffer approached the event.\n\n\u201cThe curtains were definitely lifted and Dan Pfeiffer just seemed like one of us,\u201d Lo said. \u201cHe was very generous and open in his remarks, and although I didn\u2019t really follow him closely before, I\u2019m a big fan of him now.\u201d\n\nHave a reaction to this article?
