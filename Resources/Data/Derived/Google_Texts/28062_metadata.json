That is unless you have made it your business to dodge your taxes indefinitely. Some big corporations put off paying hundreds of billions of dollars in U.S. taxes and they\u2019ll keep on doing it unless we reform the system and demand they pay what they owe.\n\nAmerican corporations are liable for U.S. taxes on all their profits, no matter where in the world those earnings were made. (They get a credit equal to any foreign taxes paid.) But a loophole in the law known as \u201cdeferral\u201d allows them to avoid actually paying the bill on offshore earnings until they bring that money back to the United States.\n\nWith an incentive like that, it\u2019s little wonder American corporations have stored up more and more earnings overseas \u2014 a staggering $2.4 trillion, according to the latest estimate by Citizens for Tax Justice. The unpaid tax bill is a similarly staggering $700 billion. That\u2019s U.S. taxes they already owe but chose not to pay.\n\nThe really big offshore tax dodgers are an exclusive group. Apple, alone, owes $61 billion in U.S. taxes. Drug giant Pfizer\u2019s unpaid tax bill is $35 billion. Microsoft owes $34 billion.\n\nEven though corporations field an army of lobbyists to create and defend loopholes like deferral, reform is still possible. In early April, the Obama administration issued new rules that make it harder and less profitable for U.S. companies to dodge their taxes simply by adopting an overseas mailing address. The biggest such offshore-relocation tax-dodge ever proposed, under which Pfizer would have zeroed out its $35 billion tax bill, was prevented by these timely rules changes.\n\nNow Congress has to get on the ball and put an end to deferral. Not only does fairness require corporations pay their taxes every year like the rest of us, but those huge unpaid corporate tax bills, if collected, could make a real difference in all our lives.\n\nAs a young entrepreneur, I\u2019m sometimes asked to speak to classrooms of children. While I hope my story is inspiring, what I learn from my school visits is just the opposite: vital programs ranging from physical education to art are being cut because of a lack of funding.\n\nAnd when I hear my family members and friends who are in the health profession talk about their day at the hospital, they aren\u2019t discussing new cures or treatments. It\u2019s often about how patients\u2019 options were limited by inadequate insurance. The Affordable Care Act has improved our nation\u2019s health care system, but we still need greater public investment.\n\nMy store supports many fundraisers for education and other worthy causes, but there\u2019s only so much private charity can do.\n\nCorporate tax dodging is a triple whammy for small business owners like me. First of all, along with all other taxpaying citizens, we have to fill the gaps when corporations avoid paying their fair share. That means paying more ourselves, suffering inferior services, watching the national debt climb \u2014 or some unfortunate combination of those options.\n\nNext, inadequate public revenue from big companies spells trouble for small business. For example, kids emerge from underfunded schools unprepared for work, and business districts deteriorate from lack of infrastructure repair and maintenance.\n\nLast, but far from least, tax-dodging multinationals get yet another unneeded financial edge on Main Street entrepreneurs who dutifully pay their taxes every year. No bag of corporate mass-produced popcorn can match my shop\u2019s Heavenly Crunch, but we should all be playing by the same rules. Public policy \u2014 including tax policy \u2014 should even up the odds between the big and small economic players, not make them longer.\n\nOur senior U.S. senator, Chuck Grassley, is a high-ranking member of the tax-writing Finance Committee. Iowans like me who object to big corporations with huge offshore profits sitting out Tax Day this year and every year should let him know. It\u2019s time to end deferral, collect the $700 billion big corporations owe us and take away their incentive to keep piling up profits overseas.\n\nReShonda Young is founder and co-owner of Popcorn Heaven in Waterloo and she sits on the National Executive Committee of the Main Street Alliance.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://dmreg.co/26pDrHh", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "B", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600025120", "og": {"site_name": "Des Moines Register", "description": "B", "title": "Big corporations sat out on Tax Day again this year", "url": "http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/opinion/columnists/iowa-view/2016/04/25/big-corporations-sat-out-tax-day-again-year/83515466/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/desmoinesregister.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "B", "creator": "@DMRegister", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b9143473d06fb9796a043dc23fad4d9de6493786/c=0-0-180-180&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/04/25/IAGroup/DesMoines/635972057233152589-ReShonda-Young1.jpg", "title": "Big corporations sat out on Tax Day again this year", "site": "@DMRegister", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "p": {"domain_verify": "372c291dc2b106308d26264f4fba3b10"}, "fb": {"app_id": 169766623060429}, "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Subjects/Small business", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Subjects/Small business", "title": "Big corporations sat out on Tax Day again this year", "author": "ReShonda Young", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "opinion/columnists/iowa-view", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e36c90b6342d7f0b4fd5478c4f82d52669157c31/c=23-0-158-180/local/-/media/2016/04/25/IAGroup/DesMoines/635972057233152589-ReShonda-Young1.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/5dda0b0b286b09ac6f5c8dc6323428707878aec5/c=0-0-180-180/local/-/media/2016/04/25/IAGroup/DesMoines/635972057233152589-ReShonda-Young1.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3b35cd19fdee73748199995eeb281d45c685c131/c=0-22-180-157/local/-/media/2016/04/25/IAGroup/DesMoines/635972057233152589-ReShonda-Young1.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0a4ffadc44e0c0b93e2a049146a2173c092416ac/c=0-39-180-141&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2016/04/25/IAGroup/DesMoines/635972057233152589-ReShonda-Young1.jpg", "publishtime": "2016-04-25T17:30:12.390000-05:00", "shorthed": "Big corporations sat out on Tax Day", "articleid": 83515466, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d0ae4667a0fa6459cf84b2d9f73ac6cd8c340ad2/c=0-39-180-141/local/-/media/2016/04/25/IAGroup/DesMoines/635972057233152589-ReShonda-Young1.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9207ff47be0ffdcb5b9e80f79475c7530d662921/c=40-0-141-180/local/-/media/2016/04/25/IAGroup/DesMoines/635972057233152589-ReShonda-Young1.jpg"}}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "article_summary": "Iowans like me who object to big corporations with huge offshore profits sitting out Tax Day this year and every year should let him know.\nIt\u2019s time to end deferral, collect the $700 billion big corporations owe us and take away their incentive to keep piling up profits overseas.\nThe biggest such offshore-relocation tax-dodge ever proposed, under which Pfizer would have zeroed out its $35 billion tax bill, was prevented by these timely rules changes.\nThe unpaid tax bill is a similarly staggering $700 billion.\nPublic policy \u2014 including tax policy \u2014 should even up the odds between the big and small economic players, not make them longer."}
