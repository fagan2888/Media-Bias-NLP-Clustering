We make things, we make patients feel better, and we make visitors feel welcome.\n\nLead physician Dr. Aaron Gerstenmaier listens to the heart of a patient at the Community of Hope Clinic in Washington, D.C. 2/25/14 7:49:46 PM -- Washington , DC, U.S.A -- Not all states expanded Medicaid. Federally-funded health clinics are getting more people in the door with insurance or Medicaid. But many still lack coverage in states that didn't expand Medicaid so are unable to pay much or anything towards the sliding scale fees. Many procedures aren't covered by insurance or the out of pocket costs are so high as to be prohibitive and foundations that once helped fill funding gaps think the new law has solved the centers problems so are donating to other health care areas or issues. -- Photo by Melissa Golden, Freelance ORG XMIT: MG 130730 health clinics 02/25/2014 [Via MerlinFTP Drop] (Photo: Melissa Golden, for USA TODAY)\n\nWith new hotels coming downtown and restaurants popping up on every corner, people naturally ask: Are we turning into a tourist town?\n\nWell, yes. But no news there. Asheville has always attracted visitors since the railroad came to town, bringing folks like George Vanderbilt.\n\nIt may be more accurate to say that we are a healing town, with many of those visitors coming up here for clean air at tuberculosis sanatoriums at the turn of the 20th century.\n\nAsheville\u2019s economy has long been built on three solid sectors: manufacturing, health care and tourism. We make things, we make people feel better and we make visitors feel welcome.\n\nThe Great Recession and our slow recovery since has readjusted our workforce, but our economy has been slowly changing for the past quarter century.\n\nHospitality and manufacturing have basically changed places in our economy, while health care has surged ahead in the past two decades.\n\nIn 1990, manufacturing in Buncombe County employed 19,620. Almost a quarter century later, only 10,799 work in factories. They\u2019re making automotive parts and high-tech materials for jet engine parts these days, instead of the blankets that Beacon used to make or the nylons at the old American Enka/BASF plant. Those plants used to provide paychecks to thousands of local residents, before textiles largely went overseas to cheaper labor.\n\nThe whole hospitality sector numbered only about 9,709 workers in 1990. Today, about 18,022 Buncombe County workers are catering directly to tourists. Food and hotel workers have doubled from 7,409 in 1990 to about 15,716. The pay has doubled from $165 a week to $331 a week with more part-time jobs.\n\nTake a look at the medical professions. Health services and social assistance represented 10,975 workers in 1990. By 2013, Asheville\u2019s economy depended on the 23,743 health care workers earning the highest wages at $936.\n\nAcross the metro area of Buncombe, Haywood, Henderson and Madison counties, that health care sector shows signs of shrinking for the first time. Health care currently employs some 32,000 workers in the metro region. But June\u2019s surprise dip of 700 health care jobs lost since last year represented the sector\u2019s largest decline in almost 25 years of data, said Tom Tveidt, an analyst who heads Syneva Economics.\n\n\u201cWe always thought of health care like a certificate of deposit in the bank for our economy,\u201d Tveidt said. \u201cYou could always count on it to grow.\u201d\n\nThe decline in June could foreshadow an ominous trend into the fall.\n\nMission Hospital is looking at cutting $42 million in expenses in the 2015 fiscal year. Dr. Ron Paulus, president and CEO of Mission Hospital, the area\u2019s largest employer, has said layoffs are likely.\n\nOfficials have not identified which positions could be affected or how many workers might lose their jobs among the 10,600 employed by the Mission health system in Asheville and at six community regional hospitals throughout Western North Carolina.\n\nAsheville and Mission aren\u2019t alone in their woes with a changing health care market. Nationally, job growth was fairly weak in hospitals in 2013, with just 40,000 jobs added, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. That\u2019s down 30 percent from the average annual growth rate of the last two decades.\n\nYou could blame the Affordable Care Act and changes in Medicaid reimbursement for the pressures on hospitals and health care providers. You can also blame the ever increasing demand from an aging population that skews even older and sicker in Buncombe County than the rest of the state.\n\nWhen industries start talking about finding better efficiencies, they are usually talking about cutting jobs, which is exactly what happened in manufacturing, starting in the 1990s with robotics, better technology and cheaper labor overseas.\n\nSo, what will be the jobs of the future? Tourism will always be with us as long as we protect our mountain beauty. And health care and manufacturing aren\u2019t going away any time soon. But we still need technicians, software and mobile app developers, climate scientists and visual data wizards.\n\nThe Asheville Chamber of Commerce and the Economic Development Coalition are looking more closely at how to boost high-growth entrepreneurs with Josh Dorfman\u2019s revamped Venture Asheville initiative. More tech companies could grow here with Asheville\u2019s advantages in high-speed Internet connectivity.\n\nThe same things that attract tourists to visit here could attract executives to bring their companies here, or entrepreneurs to launch their tech enterprises here. The more people we can attract with those talents, maybe the more of us can make a good living here in Asheville.\n\nThis is the opinion of Dale Neal.
