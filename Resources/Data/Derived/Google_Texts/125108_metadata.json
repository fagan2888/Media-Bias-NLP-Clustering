So why is it that you\u2019re taking shots of brown liquids, chugging cheap beers, and sipping expensive cocktails without knowing exactly what you\u2019re drinking? The world\u2019s biggest distiller company Diageo PLC announced it will begin offering caloric content and other ingredient information on its products, which include Johnnie Walker Scotch whisky, Smirnoff vodka, Guinness beer.\n\nOver the next few months, American liquor store shelves may be lined with new calories counts for consumers to compare and contrast between brands. Diageo began the label transparency process with the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau nearly 10 years ago, and after receiving approval, hopes its product labeling will encourage competitors to follow the lead.\n\n\"Currently, there is no obligation to provide such information in markets worldwide, but we know that consumers are increasingly discerning about what\u2019s in their glass,\u201d said Diageo\u2019s chief executive Ivan Menezes, adding that listing alcoholic content by serving size will help deter abuse. \u201cWe want to provide alcohol and nutrition information that consumers can quickly understand, instead of expecting them to do the math.\u201d\n\nNew labeling transparency may help lower binge drinking rates by deterring overconsumption. The Harvard School of Public Health says that keeping a drinking diary for three to four weeks, and noting each drink everytime you have one can illuminate habits. By making connections between where and who you were drinking with, you\u2019ll force yourself to confront your own personal drinking patterns. In the future, you\u2019ll be able to see associations between what, where, and who you drink certain drinks with.\n\nPushback to labeling is for those who live by the mantra \u201cignorance is bliss,\u201d and would rather close their eyes, tilt their head back, and gulp down the drink. Moving forward with this policy is a historical marker for London-based Diageo, and could translate into an industry-wide revolution.\n\nDiageo spokeswoman Zsoka McDonald said it wasn\u2019t easy getting the nutrition labels approved, and that the company was previously banned from printing levels of calories, carbohydrates, and fats on its products. Guinness\u2019 sales may spike when consumers find out the stout has 124 calories per 12 ounces, and that it's rich in iron and antioxidants. In fact, Guinness was marketed only a few decades ago as \"good for you.\" Who knows what kind of advertising campaigns may be rolling out in the next few months to attract health-conscious drinkers.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "alcohol, calorie, count, labels, will, change, drinking, game, transparency, may, curb, alcohol", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Nutrition labels on beer and hard liquor may change the way alcohol is advertised and consumed.", "title": "Your Liquor Will Soon List Calories On Its Label", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/alcohol-calorie-count-labels-will-change-drinking-game-transparency-may-curb-alcohol-326598", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/03/22/liquor-labels-hit.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Nutrition labels on beer and hard liquor may change the way alcohol is advertised and consumed.", "title": "Your Liquor Will Soon List Calories On Its Label", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/alcohol-calorie-count-labels-will-change-drinking-game-transparency-may-curb-alcohol-326598", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/03/22/liquor-labels-hit.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/03/22/liquor-labels-hit.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Hill", "published_time": "2015-03-22T16:07:57-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-22T16:07:56-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Nutrition labels on beer and hard liquor may change the way alcohol is advertised and consumed."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb2c8\"", "article_summary": "So why is it that you\u2019re taking shots of brown liquids, chugging cheap beers, and sipping expensive cocktails without knowing exactly what you\u2019re drinking?\nBy making connections between where and who you were drinking with, you\u2019ll force yourself to confront your own personal drinking patterns.\n\u201cWe want to provide alcohol and nutrition information that consumers can quickly understand, instead of expecting them to do the math.\u201dNew labeling transparency may help lower binge drinking rates by deterring overconsumption.\nWho knows what kind of advertising campaigns may be rolling out in the next few months to attract health-conscious drinkers.\nOver the next few months, American liquor store shelves may be lined with new calories counts for consumers to compare and contrast between brands."}
