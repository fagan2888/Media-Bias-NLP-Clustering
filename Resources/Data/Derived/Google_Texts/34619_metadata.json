Longmont Humane Society officials estimated that his medical care will cost about $10,000.\n\n\"This has been probably one of the worst cruelty cases we've seen in our area,\" said Patty Henderson, animal care team supervisor at the Longmont Humane Society. \"He has a long road ahead of him.\"\n\nBeefcakes was badly injured and found wandering in an empty parking lot Tuesday near St. Vrain Road and U.S. 36 .\n\nThe person who found him called police and reported seeing a two-door red pickup truck driving away from the area.\n\nOn Sunday, Boulder County Sheriff's Office officials were still looking to speak with the driver of the red truck or anyone with information about the dog's injuries.\n\nDespite his serious injuries, Beefcakes offered what was described as an extremely friendly greeting to the deputy who responded to the call.\n\nThe deputy took the injured dog for treatment, where it was discovered that the dog had been shot at close range. The bullet, lodged in his jaw, fractured the jaw bone.\n\nDeputies dubbed the stocky dog Beefcakes. Beefcakes, who's estimated to be 3 years old, will require surgery to remove the bullet and reconstruct his jaw.\n\nLongmont's Aspen Meadow Veterinary Specialists has offered to perform the specialized surgery at a discount. To cover the rest of the costs, officials at the Longmont Humane Society are seeking donations.\n\n\"Every little bit helps,\" the Humane Society's Henderson said.\n\nShe said Beefcakes is in foster care with a staff member and will go in for pre-surgery tests Monday.\n\n\"He's doing fantastic for a dog with a bullet in his jaw,\" she said.\n\nThough he was bleeding and in pain when he was brought in to the shelter, she said, \"his tail did not stop wagging.\"\n\n\"He was just happy to see everybody who came in,\" she said. \"He shows the resilience and true nature of dogs, which is unconditional love.\"\n\nShe said he will likely need a couple of months of recovery after the surgery before he's available for adoption.\n\nFor more information on how to help Beefcakes, go to the Longmont Humane Society's Facebook page.\n\nAmy Bounds: 303-473-1341, boundsa@dailycamera.com or twitter.com/boundsa", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.timescall.com/longmont-local-news/ci_28473801/longmont-humane-society-funds-help-beefcakes-dog-shot", "modificationDate": "2015-07-12T19:26:42-0600", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2015/0712/20150712__13TCADOGw~1_300.jpg", "sailthru.author": "By Amy Bounds \n  Staff Writer", "description": "The Longmont Humane Society is asking for the community's help to cover the cost of medical care for Beefcakes, a friendly, 62-pound bulldog mix found shot in the jaw at close range.", "ag": {"canon": "LongmontTimes-Call:article:28473801:view"}, "startDate": "2015-07-12T19:24:58-0600", "og": {"url": "http://www.timescall.com/longmont-local-news/ci_28473801/longmont-humane-society-funds-help-beefcakes-dog-shot", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2015/0712/20150712__13TCADOGw~1.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The Longmont Humane Society is asking for the community's help to cover the cost of medical care for Beefcakes, a friendly, 62-pound bulldog mix found shot in the jaw at close range.", "title": "Longmont Humane Society seeks funds to help 'Beefcakes,' dog shot in Boulder County"}, "twitter": {"domain": "timescall.com", "description": "The Longmont Humane Society is asking for the community's help to cover the cost of medical care for Beefcakes, a friendly, 62-pound bulldog mix found shot in the jaw at close range.", "title": "Longmont Humane Society seeks funds to help 'Beefcakes,' dog shot in Boulder County", "url": "http://www.timescall.com/longmont-local-news/ci_28473801/longmont-humane-society-funds-help-beefcakes-dog-shot", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2015/0712/20150712__13TCADOGw~1.jpg", "site": "@TimesCall", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-07-12T19:24:58-0600", "sailthru.site": "timescall.com", "endDate": "2025-07-12T19:20:48-0600", "sailthru.title": "Longmont Humane Society seeks funds to help 'Beefcakes,' dog shot in Boulder County", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Local News", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "google-site-verification": "lLtD9ZooxmJUEEdRSCVzkO06t_hYKtyDqZF7EA3N2U0", "byline": "By Amy BoundsStaff", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2015/0712/20150712__13TCADOGw~1.jpg", "pubDate": "2015-07-12T19:28:24-0600", "news_keywords": "Longmont Colorado TimesCall local news"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8052\"", "article_summary": "Longmont Humane Society officials estimated that his medical care will cost about $10,000.\nTo cover the rest of the costs, officials at the Longmont Humane Society are seeking donations.\nFor more information on how to help Beefcakes, go to the Longmont Humane Society's Facebook page.\n\"This has been probably one of the worst cruelty cases we've seen in our area,\" said Patty Henderson, animal care team supervisor at the Longmont Humane Society.\nDeputies dubbed the stocky dog Beefcakes."}
