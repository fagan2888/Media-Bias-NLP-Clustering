Insurance companies must comply with the law, and regulators should do a better job enforcing it. Otherwise, women will again be at the mercy of insurers whose previous discriminatory practices drove the need for reform in the first place.\u201d\n\nYou can read the entire study, State of Women\u2019s Coverage: Health Plan Violations of the Affordable Care Act here.\n\nAnd you can read the State of Birth Control Coverage: Health Plan Violations of the Affordable Care Act here.\n\nIn the study that focused on birth control coverage, the NWLC study found widespread violations of the ACA\u2019s requirement that all methods be covered without co-payments or deductibles.\n\nNWLC supplemented its review of plan documents with its own correspondence with insurance companies and with stories of real women gathered through NWLC\u2019s CoverHer hotline, which is dedicated to helping women who are not receiving birth control coverage as required by law.\n\nGETTING HELP IF YOU ARE HAVING PROBLEMS WITH YOUR INSURANCE COVERAGE!\n\nThe National Women's Law Center used more than just insurance policy documents, subscribers' documentation and correspondence with insurance companies\u2014they delved into the stories of real women who contacted them through their CoverHer hotline.\n\nThe hotline is an amazing resources that allows women to call in or write in with problems they are having getting their insurance companies to cover required services.\n\nYou can also get help by writing to the researchers and filling out this form .\n\nIf you're having problems getting coverage for birth control you can connect with the NWLC CoverHer hotline here.\n\nBoth NWLC studies can be downloaded for free .\n\nThe U.S. Government also has information about the Affordable Care Act available online .\n\nThey also provide a timeline to assist consumers' understanding of how implementation of ACA impacts their coverage.", "article_metadata": {"isStory": "true", "isPremium": "false", "description": "Two new studies say major health insurers are ignoring and violating provisions of the Affordable Care Act that require coverage of women's healthcare services.", "author": "Mark LaMet", "og": {"site_name": "KNXV", "description": "Two new studies say major health insurers are ignoring and violating provisions of the Affordable Care Act that require coverage of women's healthcare services.", "title": "Study claims insurers ignoring and violating the Affordable Care Act on women's healthcare services", "url": "http://www.abc15.com/news/national/study-claims-insurers-ignoring-and-violating-the-affordable-care-act-on-womens-healthcare-services", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media2.abc15.com/photo/2014/03/02/KNXV%20Obamacare_1393774776205_3232281_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "height": 480}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"app": {"id": {"ipad": 481439771, "iphone": 487337298}}, "site": "@abc15", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "shortHeadline": "Study: Obamacare provisions for women unenforced", "com.silverpop.brandeddomains": "www.pages03.net,scripps.mkt7057.com,www.abc15.com,recp.mkt32.net", "hasVideo": "true", "fb": {"app_id": 206808062803593}, "idio": {"hasVideo": "true", "isPremium": "false", "author": "Mark LaMet"}, "keywords": "national,world,_edit,National,News,Homepage Showcase,Tablet Showcase,Mobile Showcase,Happening Now", "google-site-verification": "oWcNYhPP-bMv5YiZlkuqquf2FnmIkb72o0tm_Qw3y4E", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/abc15", "published_time": "2015-05-02T02:33:35+0000", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/", "section": "National", "modified_time": "2015-05-02T02:33:35+0000", "tag": "national, world"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, target-densitydpi=device-dpi, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "And you can read the State of Birth Control Coverage: Health Plan Violations of the Affordable Care Act here.\nThe Affordable Care Act (ACA) requires insurance companies to cover a variety of women\u2019s healthcare costs without out-of-pocket charges.\nIn the study that focused on birth control coverage, the NWLC study found widespread violations of the ACA\u2019s requirement that all methods be covered without co-payments or deductibles.\nBut five years later\u2014the requirements that insurers provide coverage are being ignored and the law mandating health insurance plans pay for women\u2019s healthcare services are being violated and go unenforced.\nA separate study found insurance plans are violating ACA requirements for providing birth control."}
