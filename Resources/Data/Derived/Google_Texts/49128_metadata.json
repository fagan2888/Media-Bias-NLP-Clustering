At least one suicide bomber was believed to have struck inside the mosque, police told reporters in Kano. There were also reports of up to two explosions nearby, which may have been car bombs.\n\n\u201cSome gunmen equally opened fire on the worshippers,\u201d Lemu was quoted as saying by Nigeria\u2019s Channels Television.\n\nAngry youth took after the assailants and burned three suspects to death, he said.\n\nWitnesses described a scene of carnage.\n\n\u201cI was rushing to attend the mosque for the prayer when I heard a big sound and heavy smoke skyrocket the sky,\u201d Ahmed Mohammed Soron Dinki told Nigeria\u2019s This Day newspaper.\n\n\u201cIt was terrible, I saw more than 50 dead bodies on the bare ground of the mosque, and the majority of the dead bodies are kids and their parents.\u201d\n\nThere was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack, but suspicion fell on the violent extremist group Boko Haram, whose attacks have killed thousands and displaced many more since 2009. The militants are attempting to establish a Muslim caliphate and have made significant territorial gains in northeast Nigeria in recent months.\n\nThe mosque targeted Friday is adjacent to the palace of the emir of Kano, Lamido Sanusi, an influential Muslim leader who recently called on Nigerians to defend themselves against Boko Haram\n\n\u201cWhen they attack towns, they kill boys and enslave girls,\u201d Sanusi was quoted as saying by Nigeria\u2019s Daily Post. \u201cPeople must stand resolute.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Dozens of people were killed when gunmen set off bombs and opened fire on worshippers gathered at the central mosque in the northern Nigerian city of Kano for Friday prayers, police and witnesses said.
