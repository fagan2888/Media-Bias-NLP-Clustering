That was the fastest rate of increase since November 2001, when annual growth was 12.33%.\n\nOverall consumer credit, including student and car loans but excluding real-estate loans like mortgages, increased by $20.85 billion, or at a 10.23% annual rate.\n\nThe surge in credit-card usage marks a new sign of rising consumer confidence as well as increased willingness by banks to open up their credit spigots.\n\n\u201cTo the extent that consumers are feeling more comfortable about taking on debt, that would be a good thing,\u201d said Barclays economist Cooper Howes. \u201cBut we\u2019ll need to see more months of data for a confirmation of that trend.\u201d\n\nFor most of the recovery, growth in consumer credit has been driven by student lending by the federal government and, more recently, by bank financing for auto purchases.\n\nPushed by regulators to hold more capital and decrease risk in the aftermath of the recession, lenders have tightened standards for everything from mortgages to credit cards to auto loans.\n\nBut five years into the economic recovery, attitudes have been changing. A separate Fed report on Thursday showed that Americans\u2019 wealth hit a fresh record in the first quarter and that households are growing more comfortable about borrowing again. It showed that household borrowing rose at an annualized 2% pace in the first quarter, compared with a 0.2% pace in the fourth quarter.\n\nThe Federal Reserve\u2019s latest quarterly survey of bank loan officers, released last month, showed that most respondents reported easing standards for this type of lending in the first three months of this year and that customer demand had improved. Respondents forecast growth in credit-card lending would reach prerecession levels of around 6% by 2016. It grew by less than 1% last year.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "American consumers threw caution to the wind in April and ran up their credit-card balances at the fastest pace in almost 13 years.", "title": "Credit-Card Use Surges In April", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2014/06/06/credit-card-use-surges-in-april/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/img/WSJ_profile_lg.gif"}, "site": "WSJecon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Economy", "article.headline": "Credit-Card Use Surges In April", "description": "American consumers threw caution to the wind in April and ran up their credit-card balances at the fastest pace in almost 13 years.", "article_section": "Economy", "author": "Jonathan House", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Real Time Economics Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Real Time Economics", "article.summary": "American consumers threw caution to the wind in April and ran up their credit-card balances at the fastest pace in almost 13 years.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2014-06-06T19:01:25-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-140", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2014/06/06/credit-card-use-surges-in-april/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-REB-25906", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Economy", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "American consumers threw caution to the wind in April and ran up their credit-card balances at the fastest pace in almost 13 years.", "title": "Credit-Card Use Surges In April", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2014/06/06/credit-card-use-surges-in-april/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/blogs/img/WSJ_Logo_BlackBackground_1200x630social", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Real Time Economics", "article.id": "BL-REB-25906", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-06-06T20:03:09-04:00"}, "article_summary": "Respondents forecast growth in credit-card lending would reach prerecession levels of around 6% by 2016.\nAmerican consumers threw caution to the wind in April and ran up their credit-card balances at the fastest pace in almost 13 years.\nThat was the fastest rate of increase since November 2001, when annual growth was 12.33%.\nThe surge in credit-card usage marks a new sign of rising consumer confidence as well as increased willingness by banks to open up their credit spigots.\nOverall consumer credit, including student and car loans but excluding real-estate loans like mortgages, increased by $20.85 billion, or at a 10.23% annual rate."}
