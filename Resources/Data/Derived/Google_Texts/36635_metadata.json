About a hundred feet out, something bumped him. He thought that it might be one of his friends, or a seal, but when he looked over his shoulder he saw a huge head clamped onto his leg. He punched it. The ocean around him frothed and he became disoriented; he glimpsed a fin and a tail. Kretschmer began swimming. When he made it back to the beach, there were three bloody gashes in his thigh. The creature was gone. \u201cI described it being shiny, black, and white to the ambulance drivers,\u201d Kretschmer told me.\n\nIf the people who treated Kretschmer\u2019s injuries had checked the International Classification of Diseases, a system of codes that is used in medical record-keeping, they would have failed to find a precise descriptor for what likely happened to him. But the latest edition of the I.C.D., which was introduced in the United States in October, has just the one: W56.21, or \u201cbitten by orca.\u201d Boasting around a hundred and forty thousand codes\u2014up from about eighteen thousand in the previous version\u2014the I.C.D.-10 is simultaneously actuarial and suggestive. A better title for parts of it, to borrow from the author Daniel Handler, might be \u201cA Series of Unfortunate Events.\u201d It covers traumas and health conditions caused by sea lions, geese, ducks, turkeys, and macaws, with separate codes for being \u201cstruck by\u201d or \u201cpecked by\u201d a chicken. (There is also the mysterious \u201ccontact with nonvenomous frogs.\u201d) Various human factors are codified, too, including \u201cproblems in relationship with in-laws,\u201d \u201csibling rivalry,\u201d \u201crough housing and horseplay,\u201d and \u201chostility towards and scapegoating of child.\u201d\n\nThe revision has inspired dark conjecture. \u201cIf it was a droid, I.C.D.-10 would serve Darth Vader,\u201d Robert M. Wah, the then president of the American Medical Association, said last year. Its implementation will require software upgrades and personnel-training sessions, both of which are potentially expensive, and there are fears that insurers could begin denying claims more frequently, on the grounds that a new code was misapplied. (So far, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services reports rejection rates of only a tenth of one per cent due to bad I.C.D.-10 codes, although it is too soon to draw firm conclusions.) Even professional coders who are otherwise in favor of the revision are puzzled by particular entries. For Rhonda Buckholtz, who specializes in I.C.D. training, these include \u201cexposure to ignition of plastic jewelry\u201d and injuries caused while \u201cknitting and crocheting.\u201d (Asked about \u201cdrowning and submersion due to falling or jumping from burning water-skis,\u201d Buckholtz replied, \u201cYou can\u2019t stop, drop, and roll in the ocean.\u201d)\n\nThe codes have occasionally been a politically partisan issue. \u201cI\u2019ve asked physicians all over the country: Have you ever seen an injury from a macaw?,\u201d Rand Paul, the Kentucky senator and current Presidential candidate, said during a speech at an Iowa Republican Party dinner, in 2013. He was implying a link between Obamacare and classificatory overexuberance, but the I.C.D.-10 is not, in fact, the product of Washington bureaucracy run amok. Its unlikely starting point, according to a history published by the National Center for Health Statistics, was an event in 1851\u2014the Great Exhibition of the Works of Industry of All Nations, which was held at London\u2019s Crystal Palace. In addition to putting various cultural oddities on display (the German Customs Union sent in a tableau of stuffed kittens taking tea), the Great Exhibition spurred an interest in statistical comparisons of industrial products. A few years later, at a global statistical congress in Brussels, it was proposed that causes of death be classified and contrasted. One of the resulting lists, a forerunner of the I.C.D., had categories such as \u201cdeaths from congenital debility, malformations or monstrosity\u201d and \u201cdeaths from ill-defined diseases.\u201d\n\nThe modern I.C.D. is issued by the World Health Organization, and the United States and other nations adapt it to their own needs, with physicians, pharmaceutical companies, and others suggesting amendments. In the case of the injury and illness codes, this involves an exhaustive, finicky process that is shepherded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The documents from those meetings read like an abbreviated history of America in the twenty-first century. Extra anthrax codes were proposed in 2001, codes for gluten sensitivity in 2013. In 2008, meanwhile, the Department of Defense requested codes for dozens of activities\u2014tuba playing, synchronized swimming, rollercoaster riding, tap dancing, sheep shearing\u2014as a way to track the health of the military population. Not all of these suggestions make the cut. \u201cA question was raised on what codes would apply if a mother was given the wrong baby to breast feed,\u201d the summary of one meeting read. \u201cIt was stated that would be outside of the scope of ICD for coding.\u201d\n\nThe United States is, by the federal government\u2019s own admission, the last major industrialized nation to adopt the I.C.D.-10. Still, its expansiveness does not trouble everyone. \u201cThere are thousands of words in the dictionary,\u201d Donna Pickett, a C.D.C. classifications administrator, told me. \u201cNo one uses all of them at the same time\u2014some are archaic and may never be used. But that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you take the words out.\u201d Proponents note that many sections of the previous edition were lacking. Ebola didn\u2019t have a code, and new advances, such as some types of laparoscopic surgery, had to be shoehorned in under old categories. The I.C.D.-10 allows for greater precision, which is good news for epidemiologists. Geoffrey C. Bowker, an informatics researcher at the University of California, Irvine, praises it for the same reason. What if you wanted to research hazards in a specific sort of gathering place? \u201cWe want to know what happens in opera houses,\u201d Bowker said. \u201cWe want to know if there\u2019s a particular kind of danger that\u2019s associated with attending the opera, which I can\u2019t particularly imagine, apart from boredom.\u201d\n\nPerhaps the creators of the I.C.D.-10 ought to be commended for their scrupulous parsing of all that can befall the human body. Instead of bureaucratic and nitpicking, the system could be viewed as uncompromising and ambitious, a bid to give form to chaos. Indeed, it is possible to become so immersed in the codes that one begins to see the world in their terms. Jaci Johnson Kipreos, a consultant in San Diego, has applied them to famous films. For \u201cTitanic,\u201d she suggests \u201cexposure to excessive natural cold\u201d and \u201cinappropriate (excessive) parental pressure\u201d; for \u201cBen-Hur,\u201d \u201cnon-running track and field events.\u201d Similarly, Rhonda Buckholtz said that she casually classifies things all the time. Once, on a visit to National Harbor, Maryland, with her husband, she stopped to photograph a statue of a Renaissance-era dwarf, naked, riding a reptile. It was a replica of a figure in Florence\u2019s Boboli Gardens. \u201cThere\u2019s a code for that,\u201d Buckholtz said. She was thinking of \u201cother contact with turtle.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"cache-version": 20160526204643, "description": "Alastair Gee explores the latest edition of the International Classification of Diseases, a system of codes that is used in medical record-keeping.", "account-url": "https://account.newyorker.com", "wp-parsely_version": "1.7", "og": {"site_name": "The New Yorker", "description": "The United States updates its medical-classification codes.", "title": "Death by Flaming Water Ski, and Other Misfortunes - The New Yorker", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.newyorker.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Dee-Death-by-Flaming-Water-Ski-1200x630-1449080616.jpg", "height": 630}, "url": "http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/death-by-flaming-water-ski-and-other-misfortunes-in-the-international-classification-of-diseases", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The United States updates its medical-classification codes.", "creator": "@newyorker", "image": "http://www.newyorker.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Dee-Death-by-Flaming-Water-Ski-1200x630-1449080616.jpg", "title": "Death by Flaming Water Ski, and Other Misfortunes - The New Yorker", "site": "@newyorker", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "The New Yorker", "robots": "noodp", "parsely-metadata": "{\"id\":\"3142443\",\"title_alt\":\"Death by Flaming Water Ski, and Other Misfortunes\",\"featured_image_url\":\"http:\\/\\/www.newyorker.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2015\\/12\\/Dee-Death-by-Flaming-Water-Ski-728x375-1449080609.jpg\"}", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "environment": "prod", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1081530898", "fb": {"admins": 757909316}, "article": {"section": "Elements", "tag": "World Health Organization", "published_time": "2015-12-02T15:24:41-04:00"}, "google-site-verification": "_jvLA9pRQom0-f6587wRKrNwfRtqyKzjfYWvwcZ5fxc", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "id": 3142443, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0", "news_keywords": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (C.D.C.), International Classification of Diseases, Public Health, World Health Organization"}, "article_summary": "is issued by the World Health Organization, and the United States and other nations adapt it to their own needs, with physicians, pharmaceutical companies, and others suggesting amendments.\n(So far, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services reports rejection rates of only a tenth of one per cent due to bad I.C.D.-10 codes, although it is too soon to draw firm conclusions.)\nA few years later, at a global statistical congress in Brussels, it was proposed that causes of death be classified and contrasted.\nIndeed, it is possible to become so immersed in the codes that one begins to see the world in their terms.\n\u201cI described it being shiny, black, and white to the ambulance drivers,\u201d Kretschmer told me."}
