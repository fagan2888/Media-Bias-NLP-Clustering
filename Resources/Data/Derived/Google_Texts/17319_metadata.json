If you want to be on the podium, you have to do one of the best pipe runs you have ever done,\u201d Rolland said.\n\nAspen\u2019s Torin Yater-Wallace qualified for the finals but dropped from the competition late Friday. He was pushing against his doctors recommendations when he skied in qualifying. He collapsed a lung during a physical therapy session in December, which required a week in the hospital. Then a crash during practice at the Breckenridge Dew Tour collapsed the same lung again and broke two ribs.
