that means they want Australian families to pay higher electricity prices for longer,'' Mr Abbott said. \"It's as simple as that.\n\n\"It's the same old Labor, addicted to higher taxes that put up the cost of living for families and in denial about the election result.\"\n\nLabor leadership battle a real rank and file revolution\n\nMr Albanese told Labor MPs in Thursday's ALP caucus meeting that Labor should offer the Abbott government a deal to reduce the carbon tax to \"zero\" immediately if the Coalition agreed to introduce an emissions trading scheme.\n\nFor the first time, Labor has opened up the leadership vote to ordinary members instead of just federal MPs, with about 30,000 ALP members casting their vote.\n\n\"We will do the final count tomorrow morning,'' ALP secretary George Wright said. \"Clearly there is an appetite for this kind of participatory democracy.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "LABOR'S Anthony Albanese will offer Tony Abbott a deal to set the carbon tax rate to \"zero\" immediately if he wins the ALP leadership ballot today -
