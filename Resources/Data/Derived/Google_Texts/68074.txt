An Illinois Republican who called dementia and severe weather punishments from an “angry” God just won her primary. In Chicago. Really.

Susanne Atanus has two unsuccessful runs for her state’s 9th congressional district under her belt, but third time was the charm, apparently.

While explaining her platform in January, Atanus told the Chicago Daily Herald that “God is angry” because the United States is “provoking him with abortions and same-sex marriage and civil unions.

“Same-sex activity is going to increase AIDS,” she continued. “If it’s in our military it will weaken our military. We need to respect God.”

Despite believing that LGBTQ people are responsible for natural disasters and disease, Atanus asked for their votes.

“You can tell the [LGBTQ] community that I called to reach out to them, that I need them, and they need me,” Atanus told Chicago’s Windy City Times.

When asked for a comment on equal marriage, Atanus told the Times that the recent spate of bad weather was a result of equal marriage gains. “Everybody knows that God controls weather,” she explained. “God is super angry.”
