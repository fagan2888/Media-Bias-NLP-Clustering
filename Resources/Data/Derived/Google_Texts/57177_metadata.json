David Vitter (R-La.) said he isn\u2019t satisfied with OPM\u2019s response to his questions about a final rule that lets members of Congress and their staff buy health insurance on the Small Business Health Options Plan (SHOP) exchange. And he\u2019s blaming OPM \u2014 as well as members of Congress \u2014 for being complicit to an exemption in the Affordable Care Act that members shouldn\u2019t have.\n\n\u201cI would welcome this being corrected either legislatively or administratively, and I\u2019ve suggested numerous ways in which this can be done,\u201d he wrote in a May 11 letter to Senate members. \u201cIn the meantime, I will maintain my hold on the nomination of Beth Cobert to become director of OPM.\u201d\n\nAt issue is a final rule OPM published in October 2013, well before Cobert assumed her role as the agency\u2019s acting director last July. When it was published, Vitter asked OPM leadership to answer several questions about the agency\u2019s thought process behind the rule, as well as any documents and correspondence between OPM, the White House and members of Congress.\n\nVitter never got a response but sent a similar query to Cobert, threatening to stall her confirmation two days prior to her nomination hearing before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.\n\nOPM responded to Vitter March 15, but the agency\u2019s director of congressional, legislative and intergovernmental affairs \u2014 rather than Cobert \u2014 signed the letter, according to a briefing Vitter\u2019s staff put together on OPM\u2019s response.\n\nThe issue is whether OPM permits Congress to be considered a small business. Small businesses with no more than 100 employees can typically purchase health care through the SHOP exchange, the Affordable Care Act says.\n\nBut Congress employs roughly 16,000 people, Vitter said, meaning Congress could not qualify for small business status.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to OPM\u2019s response to Vitter, the agency doesn\u2019t see an issue with ACA exemption.\n\n\u201cOPM does not take the position that Congress is a small employer, nor has OPM taken such a position in the past,\u201d the agency wrote in response. \u201cNothing in the proposed or final rule indicates that Congress shall be considered a small employer.\u201d\n\nBut Vitter disagrees.\n\n\u201cOPM deliberately misinterpreted the ACA, and OPM\u2019s assertion that it does not and has not taken a position that Congress is a small employer is simply false,\u201d the briefing said. \u201cIn promulgating the final rule, OPM clearly decided to treat Congress as a small employer, and yet continues to deny it has any position, one way or the other.\u201d\n\nVitter also said members of Congress played a role in letting the branch continue with the ACA exemption.\n\n\u201cBoth the House and Senate, through unnamed staff, officially certified in writing that each body employed 45 persons in order to qualify for the D.C. Small Business Exchange,\u201d he wrote in his letter Congress.\n\nVitter said OPM also didn\u2019t provide full answers to all of his questions. The agency did give Vitter\u2019s staff copies of emails and other documents between OPM and members of Congress on this topic. But the agency said it didn\u2019t correspond with White House staff as it developed the final rule.\n\nDespite some concern over this particular issue, the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee voted 15-0 in February to move Cobert\u2019s nomination forward. Committee Chairman Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) said he agreed to move Cobert\u2019s nomination forward because she agreed to \u201caccommodate [congressional] oversight needs.\u201d\n\nCommittee Ranking Member Tom Carper (D-Del.), as well as other members of Congress, have been particularly vocal in calling for the Senate to confirm Cobert quickly.\n\nHouse Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) and Ranking Member Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) expressed their support for Cobert in a March 3 letter to Senate leadership, calling her \u201ccompetent and qualified.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://federalnewsradio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Louisiana-Governor-Vitters-Scandal-150x150.jpeg", "news_keywords": "beth cobert, david vitter, opm, senate confirmation, confirmation, nicole ogrysko", "application-name": "FederalNewsRadio.com", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://federalnewsradio.com/wp-content/themes/wfed/assets/img/favicons/mstile-310x150.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://federalnewsradio.com/wp-content/themes/wfed/assets/img/favicons/mstile-70x70.png", "og": {"site_name": "FederalNewsRadio.com", "description": "Sen.
