It was like he never left.\n\nRoark pitched five effective innings, Wilson Ramos hit a tiebreaking home run and the Washington Nationals beat the Chicago Cubs, 2-1, in the first major league matchup of young sluggers Bryce Harper and Chicago rookie Kris Bryant.\n\nDenard Span also hit a home run for National League East-leading Washington, which has won eight of its last nine games.\n\nMaking his first start of the season in place of the injured Doug Fister, Roark (1-2) allowed Bryant\u2019s sixth home run and struck out three. Four relievers combined for four innings of two-hit ball, with Drew Storen working the ninth for his league-leading 15th save in 16 attempts.\n\n\u201cWith the exception of one slider to Bryant, [Roark] threw the ball exactly where he wanted to throw it today,\u201d Washington manager Matt Williams said. \u201cHe really kept his pitch count down through five.\n\n\u201cHe knows how to pitch. He knows how to get guys out.\u201d\n\nRoark, who won 15 games last season, had a large contingent of friends and family in the stands.\n\n\u201cComing off the mound each time, each inning, I could definitely hear some people with recognizable voices that were in the crowd,\u201d said Roark, who also played his college ball at Illinois.\n\nRoark also got some help from his defense. Left fielder Michael Taylor made a diving catch of Tsuyoshi Wada\u2019s liner to left to end the second inning with Chris Coghlan on first.\n\n\u201cI threw my hands up in the air,\u201d Roark said. \u201cThat was a heck of a catch.\u201d\n\nThen Harper made a leaping catch at the wall on Anthony Rizzo\u2019s fly to right with two outs and Bryant on first in the third.\n\n\u201c[Harper] made a nice play running full stream into the wall,\u201d Williams said. \u201cHe catches it with the left hand and braces with the right.\n\n\u201cIt got the forearm and elbow, but he\u2019s OK.\u201d\n\nWada allowed one run and four hits in 5 1/3 innings in his second start since being recalled from Triple-A Iowa. Justin Grimm (1-1) relieved Wada and yielded Ramos\u2019 two-out drive to right in the sixth.\n\n\u201cBoth sides pitched really well,\u201d Chicago manager Joe Maddon said. \u201cI\u2019ll take our performance and also my takeaway is that\u2019s as good as anybody we played so far.\n\n\u201cWe lost \u2026 but give them some credit regarding the defense they played in the outfield. Those were the game-changers.\u201d\n\nBryant went deep in the first and also had an infield single. He reached in the ninth when a replay review showed he was hit by a pitch, but Storen retired the next three batters.\n\nLeading off the game, Span smashed a 2-2 pitch off Wrigley Field\u2019s new scoreboard in right. But Bryant connected in the bottom half, lining a 1-0 pitch into the first row of bleachers in left.\n\nHarper went 1-for-3 with a double and a walk.\n\nThe 22-year-old Harper and 23-year-old Bryant are from Las Vegas and faced each other in games as late as high school.\n\n\u201cWe grew up playing against each other, playing with each other and now it\u2019s a bigger stage and obviously that\u2019s pretty cool to do, living out our dreams,\u201d Bryant said before the game. \u201cIt\u2019s something we always wanted to do.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Span opened the game with a home run, and Ramos broke a tie with a home run in the sixth inning as the Nationals defeated the Cubs, 2-1, to pick up their eighth victory in the last nine games.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Span opened the game with a home run, and Ramos broke a tie with a home run in the sixth inning as the Nationals defeated the Cubs, 2-1, to pick up their eighth victory in the last nine games.", "title": "Denard Span, Wilson Ramos hit home runs in Nationals\u2019 victory over Cubs", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/may/25/denard-span-wilson-ramos-hit-home-runs-nationals-v/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/05/25/Nationals_Cubs_Baseball.JPEG-03414.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/05/25/Nationals_Cubs_Baseball.JPEG-03414.jpg", "description": "Span opened the game with a home run, and Ramos broke a tie with a home run in the sixth inning as the Nationals defeated the Cubs, 2-1, to pick up their eighth victory in the last nine games.", "card": "summary", "title": "Denard Span, Wilson Ramos hit home runs in Nationals\u2019 victory ov"}, "Author": "Matt Carlson", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Sports, Kris Bryant, Bryce Harper, Tanner Roark, Denard Span"}, "article_summary": "Denard Span also hit a home run for National League East-leading Washington, which has won eight of its last nine games.\n\u201cWith the exception of one slider to Bryant, [Roark] threw the ball exactly where he wanted to throw it today,\u201d Washington manager Matt Williams said.\nRoark pitched five effective innings, Wilson Ramos hit a tiebreaking home run and the Washington Nationals beat the Chicago Cubs, 2-1, in the first major league matchup of young sluggers Bryce Harper and Chicago rookie Kris Bryant.\nBut Bryant connected in the bottom half, lining a 1-0 pitch into the first row of bleachers in left.\nCHICAGO \u2014 Tanner Roark made a successful return to the rotation on Monday."}
