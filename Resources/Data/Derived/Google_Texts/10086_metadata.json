Those limits are $6,350 for self-only coverage and $12,700 for family coverage in 2014, and are estimated to be $6,600 and $13,200, respectively, for coverage in 2015.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act requires annual cost-sharing limits on coverage as part of the essential health benefits package required for plan years beginning in or after 2014. As enacted, it provided for annual limits on total cost-sharing and for annual limits on deductibles for insured employer-sponsored plans offered in the small group market. Section 213 of the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 (Pub. L. No. 113-93) eliminated the $2,000/$4,000 limitation on deductibles for affected group health plans retroactive to the March 23, 2010, enactment of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nYour HR and Payroll compliance and policy solution!
