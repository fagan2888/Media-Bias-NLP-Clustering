Health plans are held accountable, ensuring patients receive comprehensive, quality health care that provides expanded benefits and access to critical services.\n\nThe Agency for Health Care Administration recently reported that in 2014 Florida's Medicaid health plans met or exceeded national health care averages in 65 percent of categories \u2014 with significant improvements to services in categories like prenatal care since the implementation of Medicaid managed care. The administration secretary used the data to assert that poor, elderly and disabled Floridians have never had access to better health care.\n\nMedicaid expenditures are increasing overall due to significantly more people qualifying for Medicaid. Florida's chief economist, Amy Baker, recently testified to the Legislature that Medicaid is expected to serve over 4 million people in the upcoming fiscal year \u2014 a 3.6 percent jump in enrollment.\n\nThe recent 7.7 percent rate increase is necessary to ensure actuarially sound rates pursuant to federal requirements. The simple fact is, the cost per Floridian receiving health coverage from Medicaid under managed care is lower than under the former fee-for-service program.\n\nThe governor and Legislature deserve credit for creating a system that effectively manages health care costs while providing Florida's most vulnerable citizens access to high-quality, comprehensive health care services.\n\nAudrey Brown, president & CEO, Florida Association of Health Plans Inc., Tallahassee\n\nRubio draws crowd, raves at the Villages Sept. 29\n\nWe're already there\n\nSen. Marco Rubio is quoted as saying he is running for president because he wants \"to guide us toward the 21st century.\" Is that a misquote, or does he honestly not know that we are already in the 21st century? If the latter, he can hardly be considered to be \"authoritative\" as one of the worshipful Villagers called him.\n\nThomas Eppes, Thonotosassa\n\nTime for GOP to lead | Sept. 30, commentary\n\nRoot of the problem\n\nGeorge LeMieux, who apparently has landed a permanent gig as the Republican town crier for the Tampa Bay Times, illustrates in his first paragraph what is wrong with Republicans. They think that the midterm elections were a signal that the voters wanted far-right, no-cooperation, my-way-or-the-highway conservatives to rule Washington.\n\nOr even worse, he seems to think it is the Republicans' job to pander to the know-nothing wing of the party whose sole intent is not to govern, but to destroy government.\n\nHe skirts over the abysmal performance of Congress, which was held captive by 40 members out of 435, and then has the gall to blame Harry Reid for not taking up nutty bills passed in the House. A case in point was a bill to gut the Environmental Protection Agency. How was that touted? As a jobs bill. We also had 50 votes to defund the Affordable Care Act that went nowhere.\n\nLeMieux glosses over that a Republican speaker of the House has quit because his party \u2014 not the Democrats \u2014 is ungovernable. You want a more functional Congress? Get rid of the Hastert rule, which says that unless a bill has the majority support of Republicans, it cannot and will not be brought to the floor.\n\nLeMieux might also explain why the House will only be in session 138 days this year yet members collect a full-time check. The reason? It gives Republicans more time to beg for campaign donations to stay in a job that they barely perform.\n\nPhilip Ryan, Land O'Lakes\n\nChief defends Planned Parenthood Sept. 30\n\nHouse inquisition\n\nThe House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform conducted an inquisition of Cecile Richards, the president of Planned Parenthood, not a hearing to expose any truths.\n\nI had expected the committee members to be less than gracious, but I never expected them to be as combative, rude and uncivil as they were. Throughout, Richards displayed grace and clearly showed her courage to stand up to a group of bullies pushing their own agenda instead of seeking the truth.\n\nThe crowning moment was when Chairman Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, got caught in a lie about a slide he displayed. He said he took the data from Planned Parenthood documents, but it came from the organization that disseminated the lie about body part sales in their sting video.\n\nWe deserve better than this from our Congress.\n\nJim Higbee, Homosassa\n\nStudy: Bees' tongues shorter due to climate change, evolution | Sept. 27\n\nThreat to our food supply\n\nThis article about bee evolution spotlights the important issue of pollinators and their health. Scientists have identified global warming as just one of several factors contributing to a significant loss of honeybee colonies in recent years. A powerful class of pesticides known as neonics are also contributing to the deaths of millions of bees. Neonics are 6,000 times more toxic to bees than DDT yet are widely used in Florida.\n\nBees pollinate 71 of the 100 crops that provide 90 percent of the world's food, and without pollinators our food sources will suffer greatly.\n\nZane Almquist, St. Petersburg", "article_metadata": {"description": "Shifting the blame for health costs | Sept. 22, editorialManaged care, better outcomes", "application-name": "Tampa Bay Times", "og": {"image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.tampabay.com/iwov-resources/images/og-default.png", "height": 600}, "site_name": "Tampa Bay Times", "description": "Shifting the blame for health costs | Sept. 22, editorialManaged care, better outcomes", "title": "Saturday's letters: Managed care brings better care"}, "twitter": {"site": "@TB_Times", "image": "http://www.tampabay.com/iwov-resources/images/og-default.png", "description": "Shifting the blame for health costs | Sept. 22, editorialManaged care, better outcomes", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Saturday's letters: Managed care brings better care"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#115220", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=988277045", "msapplication-TileImage": "/iwov-resources/images/ie10TBTpin.png", "__sync_contentCategory": "default", "keywords": "Opinion,Letters,Main", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Opinion, Letters, Main"}, "article_summary": "The Agency for Health Care Administration recently reported that in 2014 Florida's Medicaid health plans met or exceeded national health care averages in 65 percent of categories \u2014 with significant improvements to services in categories like prenatal care since the implementation of Medicaid managed care.\nThe administration secretary used the data to assert that poor, elderly and disabled Floridians have never had access to better health care.\nShifting to a privately run managed care system benefits Floridians.\nHealth plans are held accountable, ensuring patients receive comprehensive, quality health care that provides expanded benefits and access to critical services.\nThe governor and Legislature deserve credit for creating a system that effectively manages health care costs while providing Florida's most vulnerable citizens access to high-quality, comprehensive health care services."}
