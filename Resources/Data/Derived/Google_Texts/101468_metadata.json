That 17 million figure comes from a study by the RAND Corporation, which said that by February of this year, 17 million more had coverage than in late 2013.\n\nBut Obama\u2019s own number crunchers at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services put the figure far lower than that.\n\nAccording to the CMS, 8.7 million \u2014 or less than half of the RAND number \u2014 gained coverage by the end of 2014. The Census Bureau puts the number at 8.8 million.\n\nThe difference is entirely due to a huge gap in estimates of private sector coverage. RAND says that Medicaid coverage increased by 6.5 million, while CMS says that it was up 7.7 million. However, RAND claims that employer coverage climbed by more than 9 million, while CMS says that it dropped by 1.7 million in 2014.\n\nIt\u2019s not surprising that Obama chose the higher number, but the wide gulf between the two numbers suggests that the 17 million number is highly debatable.\n\nWhat about the uninsured rate being in the \u201csingle digits\u201d? That comes from the Centers for Disease Control\u2019s \u201cearly release\u201d of estimates from its health interview survey. From January through June, 9% said that they were uninsured at the time of the interview.\n\nBut that\u2019s just one measure of the uninsured.\n\nThe CDC also asked if they\u2019ve been uninsured at any time during the past year, which presumably is a more accurate gauge than a snapshot in time. By that measure, the uninsured rate is 13.5%.\n\nThe Census Bureau, meanwhile, measures the uninsured as those who lacked coverage the entire year. Its latest data shows that last year, 10.4% were uninsured.\n\nBut Census changed the way that it conducts its survey. The change reduced the number who would be counted as uninsured, making it impossible to compare to previous years. Back in 1987, Census pegged the uninsured rate at 12.9%.\n\nAgain, it\u2019s not surprising that Obama picked the more flattering number out of the multiple ones available. (It\u2019s worth pointing out that before ObamaCare, Democrats would normally use whatever uninsured number was highest.)\n\nWhat about health inflation? Here Obama is on very tenuous grounds.\n\nCMS data show that the annual growth rate for national health spending had been trending down for years before Obama took office and well before ObamaCare took effect.\n\nIt also shows that last year \u2014 the first year the ObamaCare exchanges were in operation and the Medicaid expansion took effect \u2014 that downward trend suddenly reversed. Health spending climbed 5.3% in 2014, compared with 2.9% in 2013.\n\n\u201cThe faster growth experienced in 2014 was primarily due to the major coverage expansions under the Affordable Care Act,\u201d the CMS report shows.\n\nObama also bragged that 6 million people had signed up for ObamaCare through the federal healthcare.gov exchange.\n\nWhether that\u2019s good or bad news remains to be seen. We will have to wait until next week before the Health and Human Services Dept. releases its official weekly update. That will let us compare enrollment this year with the enrollment numbers from the same time a year ago.\n\nFollow John Merline on Twitter: @IBD_JMerline.", "article_metadata": {"description": "At his year-ending press conference, President Obama praised the success of ObamaCare, saying that 17 million gained coverage, that the uninsured rate was in", "og": {"site_name": "Investor's Business Daily", "description": "At his year-ending press conference, President Obama praised the success of ObamaCare, saying that 17 million gained coverage, that the uninsured rate was in the single digits for the first time ev\u2026", "title": "Did Obama Utter Any Truth About ObamaCare At His Press Briefing?", "url": "http://www.investors.com/politics/commentary/obama-claims-about-obamacare-are-dubious/", "image": {"width": 512, "identifier": "http://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-ibd-favicon-v7.png", "height": 512}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "creator": "@IBDInvestors"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-ibd-favicon-v7-270x270.png", "date": "2015-12-18 15:27:00:-08:00", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-18T15:27:00+00:00", "modified_time": "-001-11-30T00:00:00+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe02f4\"", "article_summary": "It\u2019s not surprising that Obama chose the higher number, but the wide gulf between the two numbers suggests that the 17 million number is highly debatable.\n(It\u2019s worth pointing out that before ObamaCare, Democrats would normally use whatever uninsured number was highest.)\nAccording to the CMS, 8.7 million \u2014 or less than half of the RAND number \u2014 gained coverage by the end of 2014.\nThat 17 million figure comes from a study by the RAND Corporation, which said that by February of this year, 17 million more had coverage than in late 2013.\nWhat about the uninsured rate being in the \u201csingle digits\u201d?"}
