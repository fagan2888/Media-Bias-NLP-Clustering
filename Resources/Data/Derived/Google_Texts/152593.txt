Stephen Colbert doesn't blame racism for John Boehner suing Barack Obama; he thanks it.

Nearly all United States presidents have issued executive orders, but now Republicans are attempting to sue President Obama over his use of the power when it comes to Obamacare.

In his first show back from break, Colbert expressed support for Boehner's lawsuit, claiming executive orders have always been wrong. It just took his inherent distrust of Obama and black people to finally allow him to see it.

"The Colbert Report" airs Monday through Thursday at 11:30 p.m. ET on Comedy Central.
