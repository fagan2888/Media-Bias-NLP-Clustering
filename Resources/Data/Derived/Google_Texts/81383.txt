First lady Michelle Obama believes Americans can keep the federal government from meddling with their lives by eating healthy foods and maintaining an active lifestyle.

In an interview with Cooking Light magazine published Monday, Mrs. Obama said the best way to avoid dealing with “the system” is to take care of one’s own body. Doing so, she said, will eliminate trips to the doctor and the need to deal with Obamacare.

“It’s just making sure people understand that the most powerful thing that they can do for their overall health is feed their bodies good nutritious food,” the first lady said. “If you don’t like the doctor, if you don’t like government, if you don’t like folks messing with your life, the best thing to do is make sure you’re healthy. Because that’s going to increase your odds for making sure that you don’t have to deal with the system.”

Mrs. Obama also said her signature “Let’s Move!” initiative will, over time, improve the lives of Americans and save the nation money.

The program has, among other things, pushed for dramatic changes to school lunches, drawing the ire of students and other critics. Republicans in Congress are eyeing changes to the school-lunch guidelines and the return of decision-making power to individual districts.

Despite the controversies associated with her initiative, the first lady said it lines up perfectly with President Obama’s broader domestic policy goals.

“‘Let’s Move!’ is completely in accord with what my husband’s goals are for improving the overall health of our country and saving us as a nation billions of dollars every single year,” she said. “All these initiatives are going to save us money. They’re going to make us feel better. They’re going to put us in a position to be more productive as a society.”
