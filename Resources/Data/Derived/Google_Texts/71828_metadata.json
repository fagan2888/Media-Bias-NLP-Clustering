It\u2019s the best way for businesses \u2014 small, medium and large \u2014 to avoid many of the taxes and mandates that come with ObamaCare.\n\nAccording to industry research, a typical self-insured group can expect to save more than 10 percent (versus traditional health insurance) without having to sacrifice quality of care. Even uninsured individuals in many states can access self-insurance via trade associations and community groups, instead of having to buy high-cost individual policies through the ObamaCare exchanges.\n\nThe administration and its allies fear that the more people gravitate toward the successful, free-market self-insurance approach, the worse their government-engineered health \u201creform\u201d will look.

Small-business owners should not have to make their hiring decisions based upon tens of thousands of pages of regulations in the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThat\u2019s why the escape hatch is so appealing. Self-insured companies can tailor their health benefits to meet the needs of their workers. They don\u2019t have to pay for services their employees neither need nor want.

Democrats are panicked: If enough businesses do not join ObamaCare and instead opt into self-insured plans, their prized program is sure to implode quickly as its costs skyrocket.\n\nOf course, it may well implode anyway \u2014 but \u201cprogressives\u201d are trying to save it by forcing as many people as possible into it.\n\nSelf-insurance can save countless Americans from ObamaCare\u2019s overpriced, low-choice, poor-quality health care.
