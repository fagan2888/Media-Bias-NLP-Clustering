(REUTERS/Mike Segar)\n\n4315240\n\nNevada\u2019s Obamacare exchagne decided Wednesday to give up on rebuilding an exchange platform of its own, opting to stick with HealthCare.gov permanently.\n\nThe state exchange board decided on Thursday to make their shift to the federally-operated system, originally supposed to last just one year, permanent, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reports. The Silver State Health Insurance Exchange has been searching for a new contractor to build a website for next year, but it\u2019s formally ending its search and will stick with HealthCare.gov enrollment technology instead.\n\nNevada officials created a state-run exchange for the first year of Obamacare, but were faced with endless technological problems and chose in May to move to HealthCare.gov only for the 2015 open enrollment period, while they attempted to rebuild their own website.

Xerox, the original, now-ousted contractor for the website, received $75 million to build the Obamacare exchange. But the exchange was largely unable to communicate purchased health insurance plans to the insurance companies who were supposed to provide coverage \u2014 leaving many Nevadans without insurance even while they were paying their premiums.

One woman who was party to the lawsuit died after delaying treatment for cancer due to the communication glitches.

Federal taxpayers are also financing Nevada\u2019s switch to HealthCare.gov, according to the exchange board.\n\nOfficials worried that trying again to build a state-run system and failing would boost costs even more. The exchange believes the small number of customers may not be able to support the cost of creating a third system and preferred to leave the cost to federal taxpayers instead.\n\n\u201cIf the next open enrollment is not successful, there is no guarantee that implementing a third system within three years would produce a successful result,\u201d an exchange report charged. \u201cIf the current federal infrastructure fails, it fails nationally, and federal resources will be utilized to fix the system. No additional state funding would be required to remain on the system.\u201d\n\nExchange director Bruce Gilbert assured the board that the exchange will continue to be technically state-run, but will continue to use HealthCare.gov.\n\nFollow Sarah on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Sarah Hurtubise", "description": "Almost $100 million later", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Nevada's Obamacare exchagne decided Wednesday to give up on rebuilding an exchange platform of its own, opting to stick with HealthCare.gov permanently.
