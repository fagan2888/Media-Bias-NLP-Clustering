Among the many topics being discussed at the 20th International AIDS Conference (AIDS 2014) in Melbourne, Australia, is the release of the UNAIDS Gap Report a new report that analyzes the reasons for the widening gap between people around the world who are gaining access to HIV prevention, treatment, and care, and those who are left behind, and presents action points to close that gap.

The report gives the latest data on the current epidemic and highlights the importance of location and population, showing that 15 countries (including the United States) account for more than 75% of the 2.1 million new HIV infections that occurred in 2013. In addition, it identifies a number of populations that are underserved and at higher risk of HIV, including gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM); people who inject drugs; adolescent girls and young women; prisoners; sex workers; and others. Scaling up efforts to reach these populations and localities—and particularly efforts to increase access to antiretroviral therapy (ART)—will be key to ending the AIDS epidemic, the UNAIDS report observes.

At the conference, I had the opportunity to sit down with Mary Mahy of UNAIDS to learn more about this new report and what its findings mean for the global HIV/AIDS community (see video above).

A full copy of the report, along with a summary fact sheet, slides, infographics, related videos, and other resources can be found on the UNAIDS Gap Report Campaign page .
