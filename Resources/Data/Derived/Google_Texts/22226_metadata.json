The cuts in Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements were designed to be offset by additional revenues from the Medicaid expansion. So when Kansas refused to expand Medicaid, its hospitals were hit especially hard.\n\nThe Kansas Hospital Association has repeatedly warned lawmakers that hospitals in the state were struggling because of the state\u2019s decision not to expand its Medicaid program.\n\nMercy stood to lose out on $1.6 million in annual revenue from its hospital in Independence because of the lack of Medicaid expansion. According to Smith, the impact of the state\u2019s decision was not the deciding factor in Mercy\u2019s closure, but it played a significant role.\n\n\u201cIt certainly would have helped,\u201d Smith said. \u201cI don\u2019t know that it would have been enough to offset all the other losses, but it certainly would have helped in the situation for sure.\u201d\n\nThe Kansas Hospital Association estimates that beginning in 2016, hospitals in Kansas will lose $131.9 million annually because of reimbursement reductions in Medicare and Medicaid. But the group notes those cuts could be offset with a Medicaid expansion, resulting in a net gain of $230.9 million in additional revenues annually.\n\nBut the Kansas governor\u2019s office insists the state needs to ensure any expanded Medicaid program is fiscally sustainable in the long term.\n\n\u201cMost of the losses to hospitals, particularly our rural hospitals, are directly related to reductions in federal payments as a result of Obamacare,\u201d Eileen Hawley, spokeswoman for the governor\u2019s office said in an email. \u201cWe will continue to work with the Kansas Hospital Association to find a solution that truly benefits rural Kansans, while not relying on an unsustainable funding stream from the federal government.\u201d\n\nFor the past 18 months, Mercy and its sister hospital in Fort Scott have undergone what it calls a \u201cdiscernment process\u201d to find partnerships or other solutions to keep their doors open. An effort to partner its Independence hospital with the Coffeyville Regional Medical Center fell apart last week, leading to the announcement that it would begin the phased closure of its facility beginning Oct. 10.\n\nThat announcement stunned Independence, but city leaders say they have not given up hope.\n\n\u201cUnless we can find another party to keep the hospital open, health care will be in bad shape in Independence,\u201d City Manager Micky Webb said.\n\nAlthough there are hospitals available in neighboring communities, city leaders especially worry about the availability of local emergency medical services.\n\nThere are local economic impacts as well: Mercy said it employs 190 workers in Independence with annual salaries and benefits totaling $13 million. It has about 50,000 patient visits annually.\n\nMeanwhile, Mercy\u2019s hospital in Fort Scott has also talked to other potential partners, but has not yet found a solution, Smith said.\n\n\u201cThey have experienced a little bit of an uptick in their business \u2014 they\u2019ve managed to stay somewhat financially viable over the last few months \u2014 so for the time being they will remain part of Mercy, but they are still looking for a solution there for that community,\u201d Smith said.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Parsons Sun", "description": "", "title": "SEK hospital closure highlights rural care challenges", "url": "http://www.parsonssun.com/state_national/news/article_2f8fa618-5b59-11e5-8257-57cb29368a77.html", "image": "http://parsonssun.com/content/tncms/live/global/resources/images/_site/og_image.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@ParsonsSun", "card": "summary"}, "description": "", "fb": {"app_id": 134357176756751}, "keywords": "news", "news_keywords": "news"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcac02\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThe climate of health care these days is very challenging, and particularly for small rural hospitals like ourselves,\u201d said Joanne Smith, spokeswoman for Mercy Hospital in Independence.\nRural hospitals were already struggling with declining populations, and, in many cases, their financial situations had become critical because of changes in the way hospitals get reimbursed under the Affordable Care Act.\nAn effort to partner its Independence hospital with the Coffeyville Regional Medical Center fell apart last week, leading to the announcement that it would begin the phased closure of its facility beginning Oct. 10.\n\u201cMost of the losses to hospitals, particularly our rural hospitals, are directly related to reductions in federal payments as a result of Obamacare,\u201d Eileen Hawley, spokeswoman for the governor\u2019s office said in an email.\nThe Kansas Hospital Association has repeatedly warned lawmakers that hospitals in the state were struggling because of the state\u2019s decision not to expand its Medicaid program."}
