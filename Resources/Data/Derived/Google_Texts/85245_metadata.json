They needed to fire Donald Trump.\n\nThe building\u2019s residents and condo owners had invested in the namesake, a 70-story waterfront tower along Panama Bay, on the strength of Trump\u2019s reputation. But during the four years that Trump Panama Condominium Management LLC had managed the property, Central America\u2019s largest building, a team installed by the Trump family was accused of running up more than $2 million in unauthorized debts, paying its executives undisclosed bonuses and withholding basic financial information from owners.\n\nThe Trumps had done all of this through fine-print chicanery, the board said. A clause in many residents\u2019 purchase agreements prevented them from voting against the Trump company\u2019s wishes. That allowed the Trumps to install their top employee as chairman and the residents\u2019 representative on the board \u2014 even though the Trumps\u2019 actual stake in the building\u2019s residential area was merely a storage closet on the 15th floor.\n\nThe Trump Organization sent its response days later. \u201cYour letter is a complete sham,\u201d wrote the Trumps\u2019 top lawyer, Alan Garten. He accused the board of ingratitude and criminal trespassing. After refusing to accept being fired, Garten declared that Trump\u2019s company was quitting \u2014 and demanded a $5 million termination fee.\n\nWhether wheeling and dealing with Wall Street bankers, debating political rivals or running a condo association, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has advanced his interests by leveraging his outsized reputation, canniness and aggression. The Trump Organization\u2019s adventures in Panama provide a window into how these traits have filtered into his business empire \u2014 and the style of management that could be expected in a Trump White House. Transparency and close attention to expenses are not strengths. Squeezing the most from contractual language is.\n\nThough Donald Trump lists himself as managing member in the Panama business in campaign financial disclosure documents, the company in practice is part of the Trumps\u2019 family business. In an interview, Trump\u2019s son Eric called the squabbling at Trump Ocean Club a minor aside in the story of how the family\u2019s affiliation with the building created \u201can amazing icon and, frankly, a great testament to America.\u201d\n\nThe power struggle at the tower shows the powerful allure of Trump\u2019s name \u2014 and the disenchantment and separation that sometimes follow. Even that is indicative of Trump\u2019s style: As the Ocean Club\u2019s board was trying to settle into the administrative offices, Trump\u2019s people cut off the office\u2019s Internet and phone service and repossessed the office copy machine. The Trump Organization acknowledged this to The Associated Press, saying that disconnecting services was necessary for security and privacy concerns.\n\nWithout Donald Trump, the development would not exist. But the grand ambition behind it belongs to Roger Khafif, a businessman with a prime waterfront parcel in Panama City and an aspiration to build a condominium, hotel, marina, casino and commercial center in the arcing shape of a wind-filled sail.\n\nWhat Khafif lacked was the long track record as a developer needed to lure international banks and construction firms for such an expensive project.\n\n\u201cA lot of people were saying it was never going to be built,\u201d said Duncan McGowan, a real estate agent and property manager who has sold units in the Trump Ocean Club since before construction began.\n\nBringing Trump aboard bolstered the project\u2019s credibility with potential buyers, too.\n\n\u201cI am proud to develop this extraordinary high rise,\u201d Trump said in a brochure, promising that the building would be a \u201clandmark in Latin America and the Caribbean.\u201d\n\nIn interviews and later legal filings, condo owners said Trump\u2019s record as a builder persuaded them to pay deposits on their units. But despite being listed as the Trump Ocean Club\u2019s developer in marketing materials, Trump wasn\u2019t. His formal role was limited to branding and promoting the project with his name, though Eric Trump said the Trump Organization regularly monitored construction to make sure it met quality standards.\n\nEven licensing Trump\u2019s name carried a huge cost. A 2007 bond prospectus pegged Trump\u2019s expected licensing fees alone at $75.4 million \u2014 more than a third of the $220 million total raised.\n\nDespite a promising start to construction, cost overruns and the global financial crisis took a heavy toll. Four months after Trump joined Panama\u2019s then-president, Ricardo Martinelli, for the building\u2019s ribbon-cutting in July 2011, Khafif\u2019s company defaulted on its debt. Though the bankruptcy also affected Trump\u2019s licensing fees, court files indicate that Trump\u2019s total payout remained between $32 million and $55 million.\n\nThose profits make Trump the only party to the original deal to come out ahead. After emerging from bankruptcy just last year, Khafif is no longer in charge and his former company is again failing to make debt payments. Current bond prices suggest that creditors are expecting to suffer significant losses on their bonds. And despite the building\u2019s iconic silhouette and amenities \u2014 visitors can sip drinks next to a 65th floor edgeless pool that appears to float above the ocean \u2014 most of the hotel condo units that remain under Trump\u2019s direct management still have not been sold.\n\nKhafif is no longer in charge of the development company that built the Trump Ocean Club, and did not respond to a phone call and email seeking comment. But neither the developer\u2019s current management nor the project\u2019s bondholders begrudge the Trumps\u2019 success, said Rosella Viola, a commercial sales manager for the developer.\n\n\u201cBuyers buy because of the brand,\u201d she said.\n\nMost of Trump\u2019s windfall in Panama came from licensing, but separate deals gave Trump a role after the project was up and running. One Trump company would run the project\u2019s 369 hotel rooms. Another held a much smaller contract to serve as the building\u2019s overall administrator. It was supposed to act under the guidance of the owners of the condos, office space, shops and other property in the Trump Ocean Club.\n\nTrump was essentially a condo manager but not in the usual sense. His organization negotiated unusually broad authority, including power of attorney to represent all unsold hotel condo units and most absentee residential condo owners at building association meetings. Because many purchasers lived abroad, the proxy votes controlled by Trump\u2019s team gave his company a decisive say over condo affairs.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Condo owners in Panama tell Trump: You\u2019re fired!", "title": "Condo owners in Panama tell Trump: You\u2019re fired!", "og": {"url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/10/11/condo_owners_in_panama_tell_trump_youre_fired/", "site_name": "Salon", "type": "article", "description": "Condo owners in Panama tell Trump: You\u2019re fired!", "title": "Condo owners in Panama tell Trump: You\u2019re fired!"}, "twitter": {"description": "Condo owners in Panama tell Trump: You\u2019re fired!", "title": "Condo owners in Panama tell Trump: You\u2019re fired!", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@salon"}, "author": "Jeff Horwitz", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "His organization negotiated unusually broad authority, including power of attorney to represent all unsold hotel condo units and most absentee residential condo owners at building association meetings.\nBut despite being listed as the Trump Ocean Club\u2019s developer in marketing materials, Trump wasn\u2019t.\nTopics: From the Wires, News, Politics NewsPANAMA CITY (AP) \u2014 The directors of the Trump Ocean Club met July 28 on urgent business.\nThe building\u2019s residents and condo owners had invested in the namesake, a 70-story waterfront tower along Panama Bay, on the strength of Trump\u2019s reputation.\nAfter refusing to accept being fired, Garten declared that Trump\u2019s company was quitting \u2014 and demanded a $5 million termination fee."}
