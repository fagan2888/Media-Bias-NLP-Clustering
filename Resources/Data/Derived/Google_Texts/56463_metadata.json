A total of 15 people were killed.\n\n9:20 a.m.\n\nThe Texas and Oklahoma Panhandles are bracing for what National Weather Service forecasters are calling a \"historic blizzard.\"\n\nBetween 6 to 15 inches of snow are in the forecast for the region, which includes Amarillo and Lubbock. High winds will drive wind chills as low as 10 below zero and cause low visibility due to blowing and drifting snow.\n\nThe blizzard warning for the region takes effect at 6 p.m. Saturday and runs through noon Monday.\n\nOther parts of Texas and Oklahoma, including El Paso, are under winter storm warnings, while North Texas, central Oklahoma and central Kansas are under a winter storm watch.\n\nWidespread rain has prompted flash flood watches in eastern Texas, eastern Oklahoma, most of Arkansas, central and southern Missouri and Illinois and central Indiana.\n\n9:45 a.m.\n\nThe National Weather Service has issued flood warnings for parts of northern Alabama following days of heavy rain and severe weather.\n\nThe NWS says moderate flooding is occurring and major flooding is forecast for Big Nance Creek, which runs through the town of Courtland in northern Alabama. The area is about 40 miles east of Huntsville. The creek is not expected to fall below flood stage until early Monday.\n\nA flood warning was also in effect for the Coosa River, swollen by up to 8 inches of rain over the past week.
