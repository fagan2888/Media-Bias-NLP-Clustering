In the era of the Affordable Care Act and its emphasis on low-cost medical care, C-sections \u2014 which cost more than vaginal deliveries \u2014 have become a sticking point for hospitals and a target for the people paying the bills.\n\nChildbirth is the most common reason for hospitalization in the U.S., said Katy Kozhimannil, a health policy professor at the University of Minnesota, so when insurers and self-insured employers \u201clook at where their costs are going, you start to see caesarean delivery rises to the top.\u201d\n\nHospitals not only face direct pressure from insurers to curb C-sections, but they\u2019re also concerned that a high rate could affect business. As more data on medical facilities is available to patients, hospitals don\u2019t want to fall to the bottom of the pack and lose patients who see higher C-section rates as unfavorable.\n\nDr. Allyson Brooks, an obstetrician and chief quality officer at Hoag Memorial Hospital Presbyterian in Newport Beach, remembers that a few years ago the hospital was under fire from its insurer because of a higher-than-average C-section rate.\n\nIn California, maternal care plus a vaginal delivery cost commercial insurers $15,259 on average, while maternal care plus a C-section cost $21,307, according to a report commissioned by the Center for Healthcare Quality and Payment Reform, a nonpartisan research center.\n\nOver the last two decades, many U.S. doctors began opting for C-sections in part out of convenience, because the procedure is often much quicker than waiting for a woman to deliver vaginally, experts say. Some patients chose to have C-sections\u2014 a trend made famous by celebrities in the 2000s and labeled \u201ctoo posh to push.\u201d\n\nThough generally safe, C-sections are still invasive surgeries, with a longer recovery time than vaginal deliveries. And once a woman has one C-section, she has a 90% chance of delivering her next babies by C-section. The World Health Organization says the ideal C-section rate is around 15% but in the U.S. it reached 32.9% in 2009.\n\nThe rates were influenced by factors such as the culture of the hospitals and type of community it serves. Three years ago, Brooks recalled seeing posts on social media by Orange County residents such as, \u201cIf you want to have a vaginal delivery go to a different hospital, if you want to have a C-section go to Hoag.\u201d\n\nBrooks said that though most obstetricians agree C-section rates are too high, it can be difficult to get them to consider doing fewer. They worry that trying to bring down rates will harm women. C-sections can be necessary if the umbilical cord is dangerously tied around a baby\u2019s neck, or a woman\u2019s uterus is at risk of rupturing.\n\nSo she began calculating a low-risk, or NTSV, C-section rate for her hospital. It includes only women considered the least likely to need C-sections \u2014 first-time mothers, having a single baby around their due date, and carrying a baby positioned head down.\n\nThe U.S. surgeon general has called for reducing the low-risk C-section rate to 23.9% by 2020.\n\nHoag began requiring that doctors show clear medical reasons to induce labor in women, and also started calculating and sharing each doctor\u2019s low-risk C-section rate.\n\nAt Hoag, the low-risk C-section rate dropped from 31% in 2013 to 26% in 2014, one of the biggest declines in the state.\n\nAnd it wasn\u2019t just Hoag. From 2013 to 2014, the rate of C-sections among low-risk moms in California dropped from 27.3% to 26.1%, a reduction of 1,219 procedures statewide, according to data released last month by the California Hospital Assessment and Reporting Task Force and analyzed by The Times.\n\nThe analysis also found that the percentage of California\u2019s 244 delivery hospitals that met the surgeon general\u2019s goal jumped from 32% to 42% between the two years.\n\nHoag negotiated with its insurer to be paid an equal rate for C-sections and vaginal deliveries so it wouldn\u2019t lose money when rates dropped.\n\nBut other hospitals that have brought down their C-sections rates have faced financial consequences.\n\nThe six Providence Health & Service hospitals in Southern California took a revenue hit from doing fewer C-sections, said Regional Chief Medical Officer Michael Bernstein. They also spent money hiring obstetricians to staff the labor and delivery wards in shifts, so doctors wouldn\u2019t feel rushed and opt for C-sections because they\u2019re quicker procedures.\n\nBernstein said he thinks the change is better for patients and could be good for the hospital group in the long run.\n\nIncreasingly, under changes set into place by the Affordable Care Act, hospitals aren\u2019t paid per treatment, but based on the quality of the care. Hospital leaders say C-section rates could become one of the metrics used in such calculations.\n\nBut Dr. Aaron Caughey, chair of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Oregon Health & Science University School of Medicine, said there\u2019s no single low-risk C-section rate that all hospitals should aim for, and that rates will vary from hospital to hospital because of differences in the patient population.\n\n\u201cI would hate it if Medicaid said, \u2018Every hospital whose rate is above the median, we\u2019re not going to pay you a chunk of money.\u2019 That is a bad approach because then people squeeze it down without attention to what\u2019s best for patients,\u201d Caughey said.\n\nEven if hospitals aren\u2019t being officially penalized for high C-section rates, administrators are worried about the financial effect of losing patients who want a vaginal birth. Deliveries aren\u2019t big moneymakers for hospitals, but once a hospital treats a mother, it's likely to care for the rest of her family in the years to come.\n\nSome mothers say that they felt as if their physicians rushed into C-sections, and they don\u2019t want to repeat the experience.\n\nWhen Anastasia Stone, 32, was pregnant with her first child, her doctor told her she needed to be medically induced to begin labor, which resulted in a C-section. \u201cI was a typical first-time mom,\u201d she said.\n\nStone, who lived in Santa Cruz at the time, said she later came to believe she could\u2019ve had a vaginal delivery instead of a C-section if her physician had waited.\n\nWhen she was pregnant with her second child, Stone went looking for a doctor who would try for a vaginal birth.\n\nDr. William Gilbert, regional medical director for women\u2019s services at Sutter Health in the Sacramento region, said Sutter Davis Hospital has drawn such women from around the Sacramento area because it had the lowest C-section rate in the state in 2014 \u2014 12%.\n\nHospitals with the lowest C-section rates Sutter Davis Hospital has the lowest C-section rate among low-risk mothers in California. Look up your local hospital's c-section rate >> Hospital City C-sections Deliveries Rate Sutter Davis Hospital Davis 71 598 12.0% Emanuel Medical Center Turlock 51 391 13.0% Mammoth Hospital Mammoth Lakes 5 43 14.0% Sonoma Valley Hospital Sonoma 7 49 14.3% Bakersfield Memorial Hospital Bakersfield 174 1170 15.0%\n\nThe hospital uses nurse midwives, who deliver most of the babies, and reserves obstetricians for backup. Birth is treated as a natural process instead of a \u201chealth condition\u201d that always requires medical intervention, said Carolyn Campos, nursing manager of the hospital\u2019s birthing center.\n\nGilbert thinks that as more data on specific rates of procedures or treatments is available, patients will increasingly turn to that information when choosing where to seek care.\n\nIn 2014, low-risk C-section rates ranged from 12% to 70% at California hospitals.\n\nSix years ago at Sutter Medical Center, Sacramento, Gilbert began encouraging physicians to allow longer labor in women, and began posting each physician\u2019s low-risk C-section rate in the doctors\u2019 lounge. From 2010 to 2014, the hospital\u2019s low-risk C-section rate dropped from 31% to 27%.\n\nGilbert thinks that most of the success came from publishing the doctor\u2019s rates internally.\n\n\u201cDoctors don\u2019t want to be the highest rate,\u201d he said.\n\nsoumya.karlamangla@latimes.com\n\nTwitter: @skarlamangla\n\nryan.menezes@latimes.com\n\nTwitter: @ryanvmenezes\n\nALSO\n\nWant to look like super-fit Kate Hudson?
