Too late I learned that you can develop an allergic reaction to poison ivy after previously uneventful exposures, which induce a sensitivity to the plant\u2019s oily sap, urushiol. Once sensitized, your skin is likely to react to every subsequent exposure. Even people repeatedly exposed who appear to be immune may react to high concentrations of the toxin.\n\nI also learned not to rely on the popular warning, \u201cLeaves of three, let them be.\u201d It is not just the leaves that can provoke a reaction; the stems, roots, flowers and berries all contain urushiol.\n\nTouching or brushing against any of these plant parts, even if they are dead, can cause a reaction. The sap is hardy and can cause a rash in the dead of winter, or even a year after contaminating clothing or shoes that are not thoroughly cleaned.\n\nUrushiol shows up elsewhere, including in the skin of mangoes (and the leaves and bark of the mango tree), as I discovered when I ate a mango still in the rind and ended up with a blistering rash on my mouth. Cashew shells also have the toxin, which is why cashews are sold shelled and processed (either roasted or in the case of \u201craw\u201d cashews, steamed) at a temperature high enough to destroy urushiol.\n\nPoison ivy is not the only problem plant one might encounter while hiking, camping or simply strolling in the countryside. T. radicans has two relatives, poison oak and poison sumac, that don\u2019t always form the classic clusters but are equally toxic troublemakers.\n\nMyths and misconceptions abound about these three plants and the reactions they can cause. Knowing the facts can help to spare you and your family considerable distress.\n\nFirst, learn to recognize the plants in their various growth patterns. While poison ivy is most often encountered as a small ground plant, it also grows as a shrub and vine. The vines, which turn bright red in fall, were once used to adorn buildings in England.\n\nPoison oak, which has compound leaves made up of three (or sometimes five) leaflets, usually grows as a shrub, but will form a vine in the Western states.\n\nPoison sumac, which grows as a tall shrub or small tree, produces leaves with rows of paired leaflets and a single leaflet at the end. It likes a wet habitat, growing in peat bogs in the Northeast and Midwest and swamps in the Southeast.\n\nUrushiol can penetrate cloth. Although long sleeves, pants and gloves can reduce the risk of exposure, they cannot guarantee protection. Even rubber gloves can be breached. If you must handle the plants or are likely to contact poison ivy when gardening, wear vinyl gloves.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to touch the plant directly to react to urushiol. Gardening tools, sporting equipment, even a pet that has been in a patch of poison ivy \u2014 all can cause a reaction.\n\nBefore possible exposure, use an over-the-counter skin-care product containing bentoquatam (IvyBlock) to prevent or reduce absorption of urushiol. The combination of this barrier product and protective clothing is your best defense.\n\nBut there is no scientific evidence that jewelweed, feverfew, plantain or other herbal remedies prevent or cure a urushiol-induced rash. Nor do you become immune to urushiol through repeated exposures to small amounts. Quite the opposite. There is no way to desensitize a person to urushiol as there is with pollen and peanut allergies. Eating mangoes or cashews will not work.\n\nContrary to popular belief, a poison ivy rash is not contagious.\n\nThe rash can appear on different parts of the body at various times. This may happen because the parts were exposed at different times, or because areas with thicker skin are less easily penetrated by the oil. The delicate skin of the genital and perianal areas, for example, is more easily breached than tougher skin on the hands.\n\nRepeated tilling or mowing can eventually kill poison ivy plants, as can repeated applications of an herbicide like Roundup. The latter should be applied with serious caution and only on a warm, sunny day with little or no wind when the plants are actively growing.\n\nIf you are highly allergic, or wary of applying herbicides, clearing your property of the plants may be best left to a professional.\n\nNever try to burn a poison plant. Burning releases the toxin, which may land on skin or, worse, be inhaled and cause a serious internal reaction.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2011/10/newjamnebrody.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbd3e\"", "article_summary": "Repeated tilling or mowing can eventually kill poison ivy plants, as can repeated applications of an herbicide like Roundup.\nContrary to popular belief, a poison ivy rash is not contagious.\nPoison ivy is not the only problem plant one might encounter while hiking, camping or simply strolling in the countryside.\nWhile poison ivy is most often encountered as a small ground plant, it also grows as a shrub and vine.\nGardening tools, sporting equipment, even a pet that has been in a patch of poison ivy \u2014 all can cause a reaction."}
