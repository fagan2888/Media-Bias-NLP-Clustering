Now Ted Cruz could come along and spoil the whole thing. Both senators have a path to the Republican nomination that rests on the support of the Tea Party. And when forced to choose, that segment appears to prefer Cruz, whose speech to an activists' gathering here over the weekend was the more enthusiastically received of the two. Saturday's Freedom Summit, billed as an early audition for potential 2016 candidates, provided a rare opportunity for right-wing activists to directly compare the Texan and the Kentuckian. The senators spoke practically back to back, and the crowd clearly loved them both. But Cruz's theatrical delivery wowed them more than Paul's comparatively cerebral appeal, and his rhetorical focus on conservative red meat found more favor than Paul's detours into libertarian concerns. \"I like Rand Paul, I agree with a lot of what he says, but as far as charismatic leadership, I've got to go with Ted Cruz,\" Robin Parkhurst, a state-government worker from Newbury, New Hampshire, said after hearing both men speak at the event. \"Ted Cruz has the ability to deliver a message that resonates with people.\"\n\nParkhurst was one of several at the summit to echo that sentiment. It was a dramatic demonstration of a dynamic political watchers have speculated about\u2014Cruz's ability to steal Paul's thunder if both seek the 2016 GOP nomination. And seeking the nomination is something both men seem inclined to pursue. Both headlined weekend events with the New Hampshire Republican Party in addition to appearing at the summit, which was sponsored by Citizens United and Americans for Prosperity. (Yes, the Supreme Court plaintiff that helped deregulate campaign finance and the Koch Brothers' political nonprofit collaborated\u2014a liberal conspiracy theory come to life.) Cruz finished his speech by asking audience members to subscribe to text-message alerts for his \"movement,\" a tech-savvy means of building a list of grassroots supporters. Related Story Rand Paul's Secret Weapon: Hillary Clinton Paul's father, former Representative Ron Paul, came in second to Mitt Romney in the 2012 New Hampshire primary, and the senator's strategists see New Hampshire as a potential stronghold. With his appeal to civil libertarians and idealistic young activists, he has a built-in base of support that is loyal only to him. But for Rand Paul to be more than a niche candidate and win the nomination, he must attract support from other, more traditionally Republican segments\u2014starting with the Tea Party, of which he's positioned himself as a leader, authoring a book called The Tea Party Goes to Washington and delivering the Tea Party response to President Obama's State of the Union address in 2013. But Cruz, who came to the Senate two years after Paul, appears to be muscling him out of first place in Tea Partiers' hearts. Where Paul calls himself a \"libertarian Republican,\" Cruz touts his full-spectrum conservatism on fiscal, social, and foreign policy. Cruz aggressively championed the push to defund Obamacare that helped lead to last fall's government shutdown (Paul also backed it, but tepidly), an act that made him a pariah in Washington but a hero to the grassroots. Paul got lots of attention for staging a 13-hour filibuster on the Obama Administration's use of drones last March; Cruz transparently copied the tactic with an even longer speech on Obamacare in September.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The two men&#39;s presidential hopes rest on appeals to the right-wing grassroots\u2014and those voters seem to prefer Cruz.", "author": "Molly Ball", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "The two men&#39;s presidential hopes rest on appeals to the right-wing grassroots\u2014and those voters seem to prefer Cruz.", "title": "Ted Cruz Is Beating Rand Paul in the Tea Party Primary", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2014/04/RTR3L01R/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/04/ted-cruz-is-beating-rand-paul-in-the-tea-party-primary/360634/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/mollyball"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf1ab\"", "article_summary": "Both senators have a path to the Republican nomination that rests on the support of the Tea Party.\nNow Ted Cruz could come along and spoil the whole thing.\nWhere Paul calls himself a \"libertarian Republican,\" Cruz touts his full-spectrum conservatism on fiscal, social, and foreign policy.\n\"Ted Cruz has the ability to deliver a message that resonates with people.\"\nBoth headlined weekend events with the New Hampshire Republican Party in addition to appearing at the summit, which was sponsored by Citizens United and Americans for Prosperity."}
