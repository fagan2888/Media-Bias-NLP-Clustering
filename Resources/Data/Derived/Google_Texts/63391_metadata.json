Back in 1978, when the hospital operation that he ran fell prey to a hostile takeover, Miller found himself without a job.\n\n\u201cI went up the street when the deal was completed, rented a small office and got a telephone,\u201d Miller, 78, said in an interview this month with Bloomberg Television. \u201cI had about five people with me and said, \u2018We\u2019re in business and we want to buy hospitals.\u201d\u2019\n\nThe result: Universal Health Services Inc., which today operates about 250 hospitals and health centers covering both acute and behavioral care, including addiction treatment clinics. This time Miller assured his control from the start, and four decades later he\u2019s still CEO -- and a billionaire.\n\nWhen Miller listed the company, he oversaw a share structure for Universal Health that gives him 83 percent voting control with a 7 percent economic interest, according to the company\u2019s 2015 proxy. The arrangement helped protect the business from takeover attempts as it grew into one of America\u2019s largest hospital operators, giving him a fortune valued at $1.1 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\n\nMiller declined to comment on his net worth, said Bob Conrad, a spokesman at Ketchum.\n\nBehavioral Care\n\nMiller\u2019s longevity hasn\u2019t narrowed his horizons. He\u2019s overseen Universal Health\u2019s shift into behavioral care, including California\u2019s Fremont Hospital, whose beige brick buildings sit sandwiched anonymously between an office park, retirement home and strip mall. The hospital is part of the largest network of private psychiatric hospitals in the U.S.\n\nFremont, with 148 beds handling 5,000 admissions a year, is one of more than 200 such facilities run by Universal Health. The company added 94 of them in 2010 when it acquired Psychiatric Solutions for $3.1 billion. The behavioral division contributes two-thirds of the company\u2019s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, Miller told the Barclays Capital Global Health Care Conference in Miami on March 17.\n\n\u201cUHS is the biggest private player in behavioral health,\u201d said Jason Gurda, an analyst at KeyBanc Capital Markets. \u201cIt\u2019s a higher margin business than acute care. It has a much better long-term growth outlook.\u201d\n\nPhotographer: Tom Metcalf/Bloomberg\n\nThe King of Prussia, Pennsylvania-based company continues to expand in the sector, buying Foundations Recovery Network for about $350 million from Chicago\u2019s billionaire Pritzker family in September. Its four facilities and eight outpatient centers focus on treating adults with addiction and mental health disorders.\n\nPersonal Network\n\nThe soaring number of addicts -- more Americans now die from drug overdoses than car accidents, according to the White House -- and the industry\u2019s fragmented nature made Foundations an attractive proposition. The network Miller built up while controlling Universal Health helped him secure the prized asset.\n\n\u201cThe man running it used to work for us,\u201d Miller said at the Barclays conference. \u201cWhen they were ready to sell, he told the Pritzkers that he only wanted to sell to us. And so Pritzker gave us the price, we paid it, and now they\u2019re part of the company.\u201d\n\nAs Universal Health expands its behavioral care offering, its more traditional acute care division, which contributed half of the company\u2019s $9 billion of revenue in 2015, continues to be boosted by the Affordable Care Act.\n\nObamacare Surge\n\n\u201cThere are something like 20 million more people covered. That\u2019s good for us and it\u2019s good for people who haven\u2019t had coverage,\u201d Miller told Bloomberg Television in the March 10 interview.\n\nUniversal Health shares are down 2 percent this year as investors question whether the fillip from health-care reform is starting to peter out. As he nears his fifth decade at the helm, Miller says he isn\u2019t concerned. He\u2019s using the dip to expand the company\u2019s control over its shares.\n\n\u201cThe market is very nervous, we\u2019ve had a very solid year,\u201d Miller said. \u201cAs a matter of fact we have increased the amount available for stock buyback so we\u2019re not unhappy with the current situation.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Tom Metcalf", "twitter": {"url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-03-22/hospital-chain-ceo-hits-billionaire-jackpot-by-keeping-control", "description": "Alan Miller learned the hard way that being in charge isn\u2019t the same thing as having control.\u00a0Back in 1978,\u00a0when the hospital operation that he ran fell prey to a hostile takeover, Miller found himself without a job.", "site": "@business", "card": "summary", "title": "Hospital Chain CEO Hits Billionaire Jackpot by Keeping Control"}, "parsely-author": "Tom Metcalf", "parsely-type": "post", "keywords": "Universal Health Services Inc,Health", "news_keywords": "Universal Health Services Inc,Health", "parsely-link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-03-22/hospital-chain-ceo-hits-billionaire-jackpot-by-keeping-control", "parsely-title": "Hospital Chain CEO Hits Billionaire Jackpot by Keeping Control", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff0000", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "parsely-pub-date": "2016-03-22T09:00:00.004Z", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "description": "Alan Miller learned the hard way that being in charge isn\u2019t the same thing as having control.\u00a0Back in 1978,\u00a0when the hospital operation that he ran fell prey to a hostile takeover, Miller found himself without a job.", "parsely-tags": "Universal Health Services Inc,Health,Region: Global,Page: article", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.bwbx.io/business/public/images/favicons/mstile-144x144-bbd2101292.png", "date": "2016-03-22T09:00:00.004Z", "parsely-section": "science-energy", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "og": {"url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-03-22/hospital-chain-ceo-hits-billionaire-jackpot-by-keeping-control", "site_name": "Bloomberg.com", "type": "website", "description": "Alan Miller learned the hard way that being in charge isn\u2019t the same thing as having control.\u00a0Back in 1978,\u00a0when the hospital operation that he ran fell prey to a hostile takeover, Miller found himself without a job.", "title": "Hospital Chain CEO Hits Billionaire Jackpot by Keeping Control"}, "fb": {"status": "Alan Miller learned the hard way that being in charge isn\u2019t the same thing as having control.\u00a0Back in 1978,\u00a0when the hospital operation that he ran fell prey to a hostile takeover, Miller found himself without a job."}, "parsely-post-id": "O2PUB96KLVRG01", "format-detection": "telephone=no"}, "article_summary": "He\u2019s using the dip to expand the company\u2019s control over its shares.\nThis time Miller assured his control from the start, and four decades later he\u2019s still CEO -- and a billionaire.\n\u201cUHS is the biggest private player in behavioral health,\u201d said Jason Gurda, an analyst at KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nThat\u2019s good for us and it\u2019s good for people who haven\u2019t had coverage,\u201d Miller told Bloomberg Television in the March 10 interview.\nUniversal Health shares are down 2 percent this year as investors question whether the fillip from health-care reform is starting to peter out."}
