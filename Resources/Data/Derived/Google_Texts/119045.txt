Rescue crews recovered a body Saturday from a remote stretch the South Platte River in Waterton Canyon, authorities said.

A witness walking on a trail spotted the body floating shortly before 5 p.m., said Douglas County Sheriff’s spokeswoman Cocha Heyden.

The cell phone service in the area is poor, so the witness had to hike to a trailside call box to contact authorities, Heyden said.

Rescuers from the West Metro Fire and South Metro Fire responded, and the sheriff’s office has opened a death investigation.

Heyden said Douglas County has not fielded any missing person reports and is working with Jefferson County Sheriff’s officials because the area straddles the two counties.
