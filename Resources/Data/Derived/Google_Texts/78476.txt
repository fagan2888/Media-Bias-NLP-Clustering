LOS ANGELES (MarketWatch) -- Shares of hospital operators jumped late Wednesday after the U.S. Supreme Court entertained arguments on a case that questioned whether subsidies for health insurance offered under the Affordable Care Act should be given in the 34 states that don't have their own exchanges. Shares of HCA Inc. HCA, +0.22% Tenet Healthcare Corp. THC, +2.88% and Community Health Systems Inc. CYH, +6.23% all were up more than 4% after the court's swing vote, Justice Anthony Kennedy, questioned whether withholding subsidies in those states was constitutional. Also up were LifePoint Hospitals Inc. LPNT, +0.55% and Universal Health Services Inc. UHS, +0.70% up 3% and 2%, respectively.
