It is a subversive position. The rule of law is the foundation of civilization. It is especially important for those of us who are devoted to freedom, because it is only through the rule of law that freedom can be protected\u2014a truth that John Locke stated with ultimate concision: \u201cWherever law ends, tyranny begins.\u201d To advocate that we undermine the rule of law is a hairsbreadth from treason.\n\nI have been led to this position by what I believe to be a truth about where America stands: The federal government is no longer \u201cus\u201d but \u201cthem.\u201d It is no longer an extension of the people through their elected representatives. It is no longer a republican bulwark against the arbitrary use of power. It has become an entity unto itself, separated from the American people and beyond the effective control of the political process. In this situation, the foundational principles of our nation come into play: The government does not command the blind allegiance of the citizenry. Government is instituted to protect our unalienable rights. The more destructive it becomes of those rights, the less it can call upon our allegiance.\n\nI won\u2019t try to lay out the whole case for concluding that our duty of allegiance has been radically diminished\u2014that takes a few hundred pages. But let me summarize the ways in which the federal government has not simply become bigger and more intrusive since Bill Buckley founded NATIONAL REVIEW, but has also become \u201cthem,\u201d and no longer an extension of \u201cus.\u201d\n\nIn 1955, the year NATIONAL REVIEW was born, the federal government\u2019s domestic spending (i.e., the total budget minus spending on defense and interest on the national debt) came to $187 billion in today\u2019s dollars. It was a small amount, comparatively speaking\u2014domestic spending in 2014 is budgeted at $3 trillion. The Code of Federal Regulations had 17,989 pages in 1955, less than a tenth of the number of pages today. But the numbers do not begin to convey how small a role the federal government played in national life in 1955 compared with today. It had no role whatsoever in K\u201312 education and hardly any in higher education. It provided no support for, and exerted no control over, state and local law enforcement. Federal policy toward the family? Toward the practice of religion? In 1955, the idea that the federal government could have \u201cpolicies\u201d on such topics didn\u2019t occur to most Americans. To get a sense of how small a role the federal government still played in business as of 1955, consider that only a handful of corporations maintained any sort of presence in Washington, D.C.\n\nBut even though the actual role of the federal government remained limited, its potential power had already been unleashed in ways that could not be reversed. In a handful of landmark decisions from 1937 to 1942, the Supreme Court did not merely nudge the limits of government power. It erased some of the most crucial boundaries.\n\nIn 1937, Helvering v. Davis explicitly held that the federal government could spend money on the \u201cgeneral welfare,\u201d establishing that the government\u2019s powers were not limited to those enumerated in the Constitution. In 1938, Carolene Products did what the Ninth Amendment had been intended to prevent\u2014it limited the rights of the American people to those that were explicitly mentioned in the Constitution and its amendments. Making matters worse, the Court also limited the circumstances under which it would protect even those explicitly named rights. In 1942, Wickard v. Filburn completed the reinterpretation of \u201ccommerce\u201d so that the commerce clause became, in the words of federal judge Alex Kozinski, the \u201cHey, you can do anything you feel like\u201d clause.\n\nMomentous as these decisions were, they were arguably not as crucial to the evolution of the federal government from \u201cus\u201d to \u201cthem\u201d as the decisions that led to the regulatory state. Until the 1930s, a body of jurisprudence known as the \u201cnondele gation doctrine\u201d had put strict limits on how much power Congress could delegate to the executive branch. The agencies of the executive branch obviously had to be given some latitude to interpret the text of legislation, but Congress was required to specify an \u201cintelligible principle\u201d whenever it passed a law that gave the executive branch a new task. In 1943, National Broadcasting Co. v. United States dispensed with that requirement, holding that it was okay for Congress to tell the Federal Communica tions Commission (FCC) to write regulations for allocating radio licenses \u201cas public convenience, interest, or necessity requires\u201d\u2014an undefined, and hence unintelligible, principle. And so we now live in a world in which Congress passes laws with grandiose goals, loosely defined, and delegates responsibility for interpreting those goals exclusively to regulatory agencies that have no accountability to the citizenry and only limited accountability to the president of the United States.\n\nThe de facto legislative power delegated to regulatory agencies is only one aspect of their illegitimacy. Citizens who have not been hit with an accusation of a violation may not realize how Orwellian the regulatory state has become. If you run afoul of an agency such as the FCC and want to defend yourself, you don\u2019t go to a regular court. You go to an administrative court run by the agency. You don\u2019t get a jury. The case is decided by an administrative judge who is an employee of the agency. You do not need to be found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, but rather by the loosest of all legal standards, a preponderance of the evidence. The regulatory agency is also free of many of the rules that constrain police and prosecutors in the normal legal system. For example, regulatory agencies are not required to show probable cause for getting a search warrant. A regulatory agency can inspect a property or place of business under broad conditions that it has set for itself.\n\nThere\u2019s much more, but it amounts to this: Regulatory agencies, or the regulatory divisions within cabinet agencies, operate as self-contained entities that create de facto laws that Congress would never have passed on an up-or-down vote. They then act as both police and judge in enforcing the laws they have created. It amounts to an extra-legal state within the state.\n\nI have focused on the regulatory state because it now looms so large in daily life as to have provoked a reaction that crosses political divides: American government isn\u2019t supposed to work this way.\n\nThe normal legal system has been complicit. Laws such as Sarbanes-Oxley, the Affordable Care Act, and Dodd-Frank are so complicated that they are impossible to obey without a platoon of lawyers ensuring compliance. The tax code is riddled with favors for people with connections and filled with hazards for ordinary Americans. The Department of Justice is zealous in prosecuting political adversaries but somehow doesn\u2019t get around to prosecuting political friends. American government isn\u2019t supposed to work this way.\n\nWashington now openly operates as a favors-for-money bazaar. Substitute \u201ccampaign contribution\u201d for \u201cbribe\u201d and you can describe Washington with the same sentences that describe how to get things done in a Third World kleptocracy. Almost anything is possible if the contribution is big enough; nothing is possible without a contribution. \u201cCashing in\u201d has become a term of art to describe a typical career path for senior bureaucrats, elected officials, and Capitol Hill staff\u2014parlay your years making a government salary into big bucks by going to work as a lobbyist. American government isn\u2019t supposed to work this way.\n\nSo far, I haven\u2019t mentioned President Obama, because the alienation of people from the federal government runs far deeper than the response to the current administration. But during the Obama years, we have seen a change in the government\u2019s rhetoric. We the people are no longer celebrated as being fine Americans if we make an honest living and mind our own business. On the contrary, many of us who think we are making an honest living and minding our own business are told that we are selfish, greedy, racist, or homophobic when we haven\u2019t the slightest internal sense that we are any of those things. The federal government has changed from being a vehicle through which presidents and officials celebrate the American people to being a platform for a ruling class to hector and pester us about our shortcomings. This, too, helps explain why so many of us have shifted from a broad loyalty to and affection for the government to alienation and anger.\n\nThese are just some of the reasons to conclude that the federal government over the 60 years of NATIONAL REVIEW\u2019s existence has become an entity with agendas that have nothing to do with serving the American people and everything to do with the health and well-being of the federal government itself. The lawyer and commentator Philip K. Howard, writing from the political center, put it harshly but accurately: \u201cA group that no longer shares basic values with the society is categorized by sociologists as a \u2018deviant subculture.\u2019 Washington has become a deviant subculture.\u201d\n\nIn 1958, three years after NATIONAL REVIEW began publication, Gallup began to ask a new question: \u201cHow much of the time do you think you can trust government in Washington to do what is right: Just about always, most of the time, or only some of the time?\u201d Seventy-three percent of the respondents said \u201cjust about always\u201d or \u201cmost of the time.\u201d As late as 1964, 76 percent so answered. Then that percentage began to decline. In the most recent poll, conducted in 2014, it had dwindled to 13 percent.\n\nWhen 87 percent of Americans do not trust the federal government to do what is right even most of the time, it is obvious that the alienation does not break along party lines. When I propose systematic civil disobedience to regain some of our freedom, it is not against a government that has made a few unintentional missteps and should be given the benefit of the doubt. The civil disobedience I propose is against a federal government that has fully earned our distrust.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The federal government has become an entity with agendas that have nothing to do with serving the American people and everything to do with the health and well-being of the federal government itself.", "og": {"site_name": "AEI", "description": "The federal government has become an entity with agendas that have nothing to do with serving the American people and everything to do with the health and well-being of the federal government itself.", "title": "The regulators' yoke - AEI", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://www.aei.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/regulations_paper_work_red_tape_2020_500x293.jpg", "url": "https://www.aei.org/publication/the-regulators-yoke/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Earlier this year, I published a book called \u201cBy the People\u201d that laid out a plan for systematic civil diso bedience of stupid and pointless regulations.
