Given that the latest Gallup poll indicates that roughly 50 million Americans consider themselves supporters of the movement, that\u2019s a rather shocking fact.\n\nLast Wednesday, House Speaker Paul Ryan spoke at an event at Heritage Action for America. During his talk, he outlined his vision for what conservatives must do during President Obama\u2019s final year in office. His underlying plea was to \u201cunite the clans\u201d this year to ensure conservative victories in November. And Tea Party Patriots couldn\u2019t agree more with that strategy.\n\nThe question, of course, is over what agenda will we be uniting.\n\nThe rest of the speech contained hints, and therein lies the problem. It was, as Paul Weldman noted in The Washington Post, a \u201crepudiation of everything the Tea Party has done.\u201d\n\nPersonal accountability, financial responsibility, living within one\u2019s means, keeping promises made - these are all core tenets of the Tea Party, and our movement exists to hold elected officials accountable so that they govern by these principles and their promises. In fact, Mr. Ryan himself has been elected multiple times by running on these same principles.\n\nHow strange, then, that Mr. Ryan chose to repudiate a movement that not only supports what he professes to believe, but that also delivered historic victories for his Party in 2010 and 2014?\n\nOf course, Washington, D.C., is an unusual place, and Americans are acutely aware of - and increasingly disgusted with - Washington\u2019s peculiarities. Things that would never fly in the business world, or in the private sector, or in managing one\u2019s personal finances, are routine, everyday occurrences in Washington. Americans are fed up with \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d in Washington, which is a large part of the reason we see anti-establishment candidates (Ted Cruz, Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders, to name three) doing so well.\n\nNowhere is the disconnect between Real America and Washington, D.C., more pronounced than in the area of Obamacare, which was a central topic during Mr. Ryan\u2019s speech. As he said: \u201c\u2026 [W]e have to be straight with each other, and more importantly, we have to be straight with the American people. We can\u2019t promise that we can repeal Obamacare when a guy with the last name Obama is president. All that does is set us up for failure \u2026\u201d\n\nMr. Ryan portrays Tea Party conservatives as na\u00efve for demanding repeal. Again, his words are instructive: \u201cWhen voices in the conservative movement demand things that they know we can\u2019t achieve with a Democrat in the White House, all that does is depress our base and in turn help Democrats stay in the White House.\u201d\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t the Tea Party that made those promises regarding the repeal of Obamacare - it was then-Speaker John Boehner, and Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, and, yes, future Speaker Ryan himself who made those promises in their attempts to woo our supporters.\n\nIn fact, that promise to \u201crepeal and replace the job-killing health law,\u201d as it was listed in the so-called \u201cPledge to America,\u201d is still sitting on the speaker\u2019s own web site!\n\nPerhaps the speaker has forgotten the history. Shortly after Obamacare was signed into law in March 2010, Congressman Ryan, his colleagues, and scores of Republican challengers promised they would repeal Obamacare. It was a significant campaign pledge, and conservatives and a strong majority of Independents across the country voted for Republicans based almost exclusively on that promise.\n\nThree years later, as Obamacare was becoming ever more entrenched, Sens. Mike Lee of Utah and Ted Cruz of Texas began a brave battle to live up to the promises they and many of their colleagues had made, with an effort to block funding for the health care law. As they argued at the time, Obamacare was proving to be every bit as awful as we had predicted it would be, and Congress had a duty to use its constitutional power of the purse to render the law null and void. It was a bold move, and cost both Senators dearly. The Washington Establishment - including Democrats and Republicans - scornfully dismissed this effort, labeling them and their Tea Party supporters as quixotic, a nuisance, and worse.\n\nThat episode in 2013 revealed a dirty secret to Americans: While the GOP Establishment is all too happy to talk about repealing Obamacare on the campaign trail and when crafting messaging opportunities as it did with the 2010 \u201cPledge to America,\u201d when it actually comes to making good on their promises, they are content to wring their hands helplessly and bemoan the fact that there is a Democrat in the White House. Our Founding Fathers, who labored over the meticulous details of dividing power and incentivizing accountability structures within our system of government, would no doubt be surprised that the current Speaker of the House holds the view that Congress is such an impotent body.\n\nSpeaker Ryan derides our movement as an \u201copposition movement,\u201d but that misses the point; we are an accountability movement, and as such, we believe our most important responsibility is to hold Members of Congress (from both political parties!) accountable. And promises made on the campaign trail are absolutely fair game for accountability purposes.\n\nSpeaker Ryan took to the podium last Wednesday to chide us about the importance of \u201cuniting the clans.\u201d The Tea Party response is: \u201cYes, absolutely. But let\u2019s unite around something other than capitulating to the Left\u2019s agenda, shall we?\u201d The Washington Establishment still has a lot to learn about the essence of the Tea Party. November\u2019s elections should be a helpful lesson.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Almost seven years after the birth of the Tea Party, it's clear that official Washington still doesn't understand what led to the birth and growth of the movement.
