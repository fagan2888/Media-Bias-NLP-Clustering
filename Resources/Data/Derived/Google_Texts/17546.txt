One common refrain this week among conservatives is that President Obama and the White House have a very steadfast resistance to referring to terrorists like the ones in Paris as “Islamic extremists” or “Islamic radicals.” Josh Earnest argued it’s a matter of “accuracy,” but the administration hasn’t provided much of an explanation beyond that.

And now, Democratic Congresswoman and Army veteran Tulsi Gabbard is joining in on that criticism, telling Wolf Blitzer on CNN today, “It’s frustrating how, as we look at the situation there, our administration refuses to recognize who our enemy is.”

Gabbard said rather definitively “this is about radical Islam” and lamented how the White House won’t be more honest about discussing the threat:

“I’m upset that the President and the White House… [are] not actually saying, ‘This is a war that the Islamic extremists are posing against the United States and against the West and we recognize who our enemy is and come up with a strategy to defeat that enemy.'”
