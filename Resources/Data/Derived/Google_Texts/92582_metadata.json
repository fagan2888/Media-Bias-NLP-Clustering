The measure authorized Gregg County to create an account called a Local Provider Participation Fund, with money provided by the hospitals.\n\nGregg commissioners created the fund Thursday after a public hearing.\n\nThe account funds are sent to the Texas Health and Human Services Commission in Austin, where federal Medicaid funds are added.\n\nEstablished to help primarily rural hospitals, and hospitals that are not supported by taxing districts, the local legislation also helps hospitals in Cherokee and Bowie counties. Similar bills were filed for six other counties, Cunningham said.\n\nThe bills trigger a mechanism by which at least double the money transferred to Austin returns to the county to reimburse the hospitals.\n\n\"It's probably going to be somewhere in the $10 million range,\" Cunningham said, adding that reimbursement is cumulative through 2016 \u2014 it's not an annual payment.\n\nIt's help at a time the former county hospital can use it.\n\nGood Shepherd Health Systems in recent years has reversed a minor expansion to other sites inside Longview and in other cities that had been taking place. Good Shepherd facilities have closed in Gilmer and Linden as the non-for-profit foundation that operates the Good Shepherd System dealt with a growing gap between spending and revenue.\n\n\"The initiatives that we've put in place already are turning our situation around,\" Cunningham said. \"So, we're a much stronger hospital system. This (reimbursement) allows us to be even stronger going forward, for facing challenges that all hospital systems are going to face in the future.\"\n\nIt was an offer neither Longview hospital could refuse.\n\nJim Kendrick, the outgoing CEO of Longview Regional, said his hospital spends about $10 million annually on uncompensated care.\n\n\"Hopefully, we will end up with an additional $5 million,\" he said. \"This was a collaboration between health care organizations for the betterment of the community.\"\n\nBoth hospital leaders praised a coalition of elected officials that was led by Sen. Kevin Eltife of Tyler and Rep. David Simpson of Longview. The two Republican state lawmakers carried identical bills enabling the reimbursement, joined by fellow East Texas GOP Reps. Chris Paddie of Marshall and Travis Clardy of Nacogdoches.\n\n\"It was a collaborative effort from both the (Texas) House and Senate,\" Kendrick said. \"That's David (Simpson) and Kevin Eltife.\"\n\nCunningham said County Judge Bill Stoudt, county commissioners and the Northeast Texas lawmakers were eager to help once it was clear the two rival hospitals were teaming up.\n\n\"That's kind of where we started this discussion,\" he said. \"Once all the hospitals were on board, we talked to Judge Stoudt. He was very supportive, and the county commissioners were very supportive. It was something that was a local effort with everybody on board.\"", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "og": {"url": "http://www.news-journal.com/news/2015/jun/07/new-law-a-needed-boost-for-hospital/", "image": "https://static.texascommunitymedia.com/img/photos/2015/06/06/040213-Medicaid_4_2607909.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "A newly approved state law that brought Longview's two hospitals onto the same team could mean $15 million or more in Medicaid reimbursements on the ...", "title": "New law a needed boost for hospital - Longview News-Journal"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "blitz": "mu-10ba9b19-0c38fcd6-4c764ea6-9fa4649b", "fb": {"app_id": 1419380718274846}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://static.texascommunitymedia.com/static/lnj/images/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0b90\"", "article_summary": "It's a funding boost that comes at just the right time for Good Shepherd Health Systems.\nGood Shepherd facilities have closed in Gilmer and Linden as the non-for-profit foundation that operates the Good Shepherd System dealt with a growing gap between spending and revenue.\nIt's help at a time the former county hospital can use it.\nThe account funds are sent to the Texas Health and Human Services Commission in Austin, where federal Medicaid funds are added.\nIt was an offer neither Longview hospital could refuse."}
