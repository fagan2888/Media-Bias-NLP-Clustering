Mike Rogers, R-Howell, for the 8th Congressional District seat. Rogers is retiring.\n\nBishop was the Senate Majority Leader under former Gov. Jennifer Granholm. Since leaving office, Bishop has been the chief legal officer for International Bancard Corp. and is an adjunct professor at Thomas M. Cooley Law School.\n\nMcMillin was elected to his third term in the Michigan House of Representatives in 2012.\n\nBoth candidates are opposed to Obamacare and prefer a market-based insurance plan. Both candidates support U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan\u2019s \u201cpremium support\u201d plan on Medicare. The premium support plan allows seniors the choice of a private plan that competes alongside the traditional fee-for-service Medicare program on a newly created Medicare Exchange. Medicare would provide a premium-support payment to pay for or offset the premium of the plan chosen by the senior.\n\n\u201cI believe we can make health care more affordable and accessible without putting the federal government in charge of Americans\u2019 health care decisions,\u201d Bishop said. \u201cWe need patient-centered, free-market policies that will strengthen competition. I also believe that we must simplify our tax code in order to keep people\u2019s hard-earned money in the private sector in order to help stimulate the economy.\u201d\n\nMcMillin said he would support a plan that provides more choice to those on Medicare.\n\nStay Engaged\n\n\u201cI would prefer health care and health insurance policy be sent to the states,\u201d McMillin said. \u201cIf a state wanted to try a more socialized Romneycare kind of plan, they could do that \u2014 though I think they would pay a price as businesses and citizens left to go to states with a more market-based system.\u201d\n\nThe charter of the Export-Import Bank of the United States expires September of 2014. Neither candidate supports extending it.\n\nThe Ex-Im Bank is the export credit agency of the U.S. and helps with the financing for overseas companies in buying of U.S. exports. Because the bank gives special subsidies to select companies that the private market will not, it has faced criticism from free-market advocates.\n\n\u201cU.S. taxpayers should not be strapped with the default risks on loans that certain select businesses have,\u201d McMillin said. \u201cIt\u2019s a clear case of corporate welfare.\u201d\n\nBishop said there needs to be less government intervention and more of a focus on private-sector solutions.\n\nBishop said he supports expanding all sources of American energy and supports an \u201call-of-the-above\u201d energy policy.\n\n\u201cWe must have a new policy in this country that focuses on safely using American innovation and American natural resources to create millions of jobs, bring down the cost of energy and make America independent from overseas oil,\u201d Bishop said. \u201cSubsidies only add to distort the market creating an uneven playing field that leads to increased prices.\u201d\n\nMcMillin said all forms of safe energy production should be allowed.\n\n\u201cBut I support ending the subsidies and tax credits to special interest energy sectors,\u201d he said. \u201cWe must stop distorting the free market and stop the government from picking winners and losers.\u201d\n\nMcMillin said he would support ending all ethanol subsidies and mandates.\n\n\u201cAgain, I oppose government picking winners and losers, which due to political influence rarely pick the best option,\u201d McMillin said.\n\nBishop said he would allow the ethanol subsidies to expire, \u201cwhile understanding the importance of finding an alternative source of energy that will lead to energy independence.\u201d\n\nBoth candidates are also against having the federal government play a major role in the home loan industry.\n\nEach candidate has criticized the other for various votes in the past.\n\nMcMillin said that Bishop has a long voting record of supporting the government picking \u201cwinner and losers\u201d with various economic development programs.\n\n\u201cI am the House leader in opposing corporate welfare and government subsidies that usually end up costing the tax payers millions more than any benefit to the state,\u201d McMillin said. \u201cMy opponent voted for all of these corporate subsidies paid for by Michigan taxpayers, such wind power, film subsidies \u2026\u201d\n\nAs Senate Speaker, Bishop did stand against then-Gov. Jennifer Granholm and Democratic Leader of the House Andy Dillon in 2009 against another tax hike. Gov. Granholm eventually signed the 2010 budget but said the cuts were too deep and she didn\u2019t agree with it or support it.\n\nBishop said he has a record of persuading Democrats to cut government.\n\n\u201cMy opponent does not,\u201d Bishop said. \u201cDuring my time in the Michigan Legislature, I built a record on finding solutions; working with Republicans and Democrats to achieve tangible, conservative reforms. My opponent has spent many years either being unable or unwilling to work with either side of the aisle to get things done. It takes more to achieve reforms than voting \u2018no\u2019 out of principle.\u201d\n\nMcMillin, however, has worked with the ACLU as well as House and Senate Democrats to provide better lawyers to people who couldn\u2019t afford attorneys.\n\n\u201cIf you had told me during my Christian Coalition years that I\u2019d be working with the ACLU, I would have called you crazy,\u201d McMillin said in an MLive story. \u201cBut when you\u2019re working on something you feel strongly about, you can work with groups that you normally wouldn\u2019t agree with.\"\n\nEditor's note: Michigan Capitol Confidential will be reporting and writing about key primary races leading up to the election on Aug. 5.
