(AP) - In a case that could test Nebraska\u2019s strict cap on medical malpractice awards, a federal jury has awarded the family of a 2-year-old girl a whopping $17 million, finding that subpar care at Bellevue Medical Center caused her severe disability.\n\nNebraska tort laws cap medical malpractice awards at $2.25 million. The cap at the time of the girl\u2019s birth was $1.75 million.\n\nA Bellevue Medical Center administrator told The Omaha World-Herald (http://bit.ly/1T5nZvM ) that the hospital was not at fault.\n\n\u201cWe strongly maintain that the objective medical evidence demonstrates that there was no wrongdoing or deviation from the standard of care on the part of our staff that led to this tragic outcome,\u201d said Deb Istas, chief operating officer of the hospital.\n\nA spokesman for Nebraska Medicine, of which the hospital is a part, says no decision has been made on whether to appeal the verdict.\n\nThe girl\u2019s mother, Doran Schmidt, alleged hospital workers were negligent in the hours leading to the girl\u2019s complicated birth on Nov. 2, 2012.\n\nSchmidt\u2019s complaint said she began having contractions two days earlier. When she went to her midwife the next day, she spent hours having contractions before she was taken to Bellevue Medical Center, her attorney, Pat Cullan, said.\n\nAt the hospital, nobody determined the position of the fetus or measured the strength of the contractions, Cullan said.\n\n\u201cThey never had a physician assess her,\u201d he said.\n\nCullan said the result was that the baby suffered oxygen deprivation, brain compression and brain damage.\n\nSchmidt said her child cannot walk or talk and has limited vision as a result. Schmidt said she would use the money for physical therapy, occupational therapy, medical care, equipment and other services the girl will need throughout her life.\n\nA separate, confidential settlement was reached with the midwife, Cullan said.\n\nCullan dismissed suggestions that the jury\u2019s award will be cut to state\u2019s cap. His clients won\u2019t be limited to the cap, he said, because the hospital failed to meet certain obligations to qualify for it. Cullan declined to discuss those obligations.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Omaha World-Herald, http://www.omaha.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "In a case that could test Nebraska's strict cap on medical malpractice awards, a federal jury has awarded the family of a 2-year-old girl a whopping $17 million, finding that subpar care at Bellevue Medical Center caused her severe disability.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/aug/8/17-million-jury-award-could-test-nebraska-tort-cap/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "In a case that could test Nebraska\u2019s strict cap on medical malpractice awards, a federal jury has awarded the family of a 2-year-old girl a whopping $17 million, finding that subpar care at Bellevue Medical Center caused her severe disability.", "title": "$17 million jury award could test Nebraska tort cap"}, "twitter": {"description": "In a case that could test Nebraska's strict cap on medical malpractice awards, a federal jury has awarded the family of a 2-year-old girl a whopping $17 million, finding that subpar care at Bellevue M", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "$17 million jury award could test Nebraska tort cap"}, "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdaba6\"", "article_summary": "Nebraska tort laws cap medical malpractice awards at $2.25 million.\n(AP) - In a case that could test Nebraska\u2019s strict cap on medical malpractice awards, a federal jury has awarded the family of a 2-year-old girl a whopping $17 million, finding that subpar care at Bellevue Medical Center caused her severe disability.\nA Bellevue Medical Center administrator told The Omaha World-Herald (http://bit.ly/1T5nZvM ) that the hospital was not at fault.\nSchmidt said she would use the money for physical therapy, occupational therapy, medical care, equipment and other services the girl will need throughout her life.\nAt the hospital, nobody determined the position of the fetus or measured the strength of the contractions, Cullan said."}
