This group in 2013 accounted for more than 27 percent of the U.S. insured population.\n\nUse of brand prescription drugs, inpatient admissions and outpatient services declined in 2013. Still, average prices increased for all three categories, and at higher rates than in 2012.\n\n\n\n[ALSO: CDC Report Examines Obesity and Antidepressants]\n\nOut-of-pocket averages in 2013 among both men and women totaled $800 per consumer, a 4 percent increase over 2012. There was no increase in out-of-pocket spending for young adult women, though health care expenditures per capita were higher for women than for men in 2012.\n\nYoung adult women, or those aged 19 to 25, spent an average of $662 out of pocket, the same as the year before.\n\nThis was almost completely due to a drop in out-of-pocket spending on generic and brand hormone contraceptives, which are now covered by employers under a provision in the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\n\nHealth care expenditures per capita were higher for women than men in 2012. Health Care Cost Institute\n\nIn 2013, adult women ages 19 to 54 had higher levels of outpatient and professional service use than adult men. But after age 54, the gender gap in use of these services narrowed, as men increase their use of radiology, laboratory and pathology services.\n\nOut-of-pocket spending went down for both brand and generic prescriptions. Antidepressants were the most used generic drugs in 2013 among young adult men, intermediate adult men, middle aged adult women and pre-Medicare adult women. They account for 10 percent of all generic drug use. Generic prescription use overall increased in 2013 by 4.5 percent.\n\nBrand name drugs are more expensive and discouraged by portions of the Affordable Care Act as a way to cut back on health spending. Still, the trend found in other portions of the report applied here. Total spending on brand name drugs grew 2.4 percent, yet their use dropped by 15.5 percent. The average price per filled day increased more than 21.2 percent.\n\n\n\n[READ: Including Mental Health Saves Money, Improves Overall Health]\n\nInpatient admissions and outpatient services declined in 2013, though average prices increased for both.\n\nAcute inpatient hospital admissions fell 2.3 percent while prices rose 6.7 percent, causing overall inpatient spending to rise by 3.8 percent. The average price per admission grew by $1,101 in 2013 to $18,030.\n\nOutpatient services declined by 0.8 percent while prices rose 6.4 percent, resulting in a total outpatient visit spending growth of 5.5 percent.\n\n\n\nMore dollars are being spent on outpatient care, though they have historically gone toward professional procedures and inpatient care. Health Care Cost Institute\n\nThough adults across various age groups use emergency room services differently, their spending was similar. Young adults, or those aged 19 to 25, visited the emergency room more often than older pre-Medicare adults, or those ages 55 to 64. Older adults, however, had a higher average price for their visits, due partially to use of more intensive care, the report says.\n\nBecause of this, amounts spent on emergency room visits were similar across those age groups. Spending on emergency room visits averaged $314 per capita for older adults, compared to $310 per young adult.\n\nSome utilization of health care goods and services in 2013 increased. These included professional services, such office visits and lab tests. Preventive visits to primary care doctors and contraceptive hormone use both rose 5 percent.", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Data Mine [News]", "title": "Americans Using Less Health Care But Spending More Despite Obamacare Promises", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Health care prices jumped as use of costly services fell.", "title": "Despite Obamacare Promises, Health Costs Up", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/data-mine/2014/10/28/americans-using-less-health-care-but-spending-more-despite-obamacare-promises", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/84/04/567b646d45cd85b3d3f7874cb2b9/141028-bill-stock.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Americans Using Less Health Care But Spending More Despite Obamacare Promises", "description": "Health care prices jumped as use of costly services fell.", "card": "summary", "site": "@USNews"}, "site": "news", "date_published": "Oct. 28, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Kimberly Leonard,Pulse,picks,DatamineHealthcare,health,health care reform,Affordable Care Act,health care,Data Mine [News]", "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Health care prices jumped as use of costly services fell."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfd97\"", "article_summary": "Antidepressants were the most used generic drugs in 2013 among young adult men, intermediate adult men, middle aged adult women and pre-Medicare adult women.\nHealth Care Cost InstituteFalling utilization helped mask continued growth in health care prices, authors of the report state.\n[READ: Insurance Companies Find Obamacare Loopholes]The Health Care Cost and Utilization Report found that health care spending averaged $4,864 per enrollee in 2013, up $183 from the year before.\nThe average health care enrollee spent $183 more on medical costs in 2013 than the year before, a new report finds.\nHealth Care Cost InstituteIn 2013, adult women ages 19 to 54 had higher levels of outpatient and professional service use than adult men."}
