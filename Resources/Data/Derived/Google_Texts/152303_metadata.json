You call the office of the obstetrician you\u2019ve chosen for just this eventuality, and the receptionist congratulates you and sets you an appointment four or six or eight weeks away. \u201cBut,\u201d you think, \u201cI have so many questions now!\u201d The books aren\u2019t enough. So you turn, of course, to Google, and navigate the thickets of information alone.\n\nIf this was your pregnancy experience and it struck you as odd or off or wrong, you\u2019re not alone, according to a recent small study that likely reflects a far broader opinion. Writes one pregnant friend: \u201cMy docs are wonderful and insanely knowledgeable, and I call them for the big stuff. However, there\u2019s so much little stuff when you\u2019re pregnant, especially for the first time. It\u2019s constant googling, is this normal? Everything from symptoms, food, exercise routines, massages, whether to dye your hair \u2013 it\u2019s endless.\u201d\n\nAnd some things you need to know early, she notes. \u201cI did have the books \u2013 I found the Mayo Clinic guide to a healthy pregnancy to be quite good. But, not so easily searchable, especially when you\u2019re at dinner and you\u2019re like, \u2018Can I eat xyz?\u2019 My husband downloaded a few apps right away that allow you to search what you can eat, what to avoid. Some are obvious: alcohol, sushi, some way less so \u2013 um, lunch meat?\u201d\n\nFrom the study\u2019s press release:\n\nPregnant women are using the Internet to seek answers to their medical questions more often than they would like, say Penn State researchers. \u201cWe found that first-time moms were upset that their first prenatal visit did not occur until eight weeks into pregnancy,\u201d said Jennifer L. Kraschnewski, assistant professor of medicine and public health sciences, Penn State College of Medicine. \u201cThese women reported using Google and other search engines because they had a lot of questions at the beginning of pregnancy, before their first doctor\u2019s appointment.\u201d Following the women\u2019s first visit to the obstetrician, many of them still turned to the Internet \u2014 in the form of both search engines and social media \u2014 to find answers to their questions, because they felt the literature the doctor\u2019s office gave them was insufficient. Despite the rapid evolution of technology, the structure of prenatal care has changed little over the past century in the U.S., the researchers said. Kraschnewski and colleagues set out to gather information to develop a smartphone app for women to use during pregnancy, and incidentally discovered that many women were unsatisfied with the structure of their prenatal care. The researchers conducted four focus groups, totaling 17 pregnant women \u2014 all of whom were over 18 and owned a smartphone. Most of the mothers-to-be agreed that the structure of prenatal visits are not responsive to their individual needs, so they turned to technology to fill their knowledge gaps, Kraschnewski and colleagues reported in a recent issue of the Journal of Medical Internet Research. However, the women were unsatisfied by the questionable accuracy of the information they found online.\n\nThat was exactly my friend\u2019s experience: She found sites like babycenter.com helpful, but worried that much of what she read had not been medically vetted:\n\n\u201cI will also mention the love/hate relationship with the site forums. Sometimes, they are wildly reassuring, with women writing in with similar experiences. But plenty of other times they are downright alarming. It\u2019s impossible to know who to trust, and there are very few moderators. One or two sites I\u2019ve seen do have doctors weigh in, but it\u2019s unclear who they are.\u201d\n\nAnd even once women got to the doctor, the study found them unsatisfied, data-wise:\n\nMany of the participants found the pamphlets and flyers that their doctors gave them, as well as the once popular book \u201cWhat to Expect When You\u2019re Expecting,\u201d outdated and preferred receiving information in different formats. They would rather watch videos and use social media and pregnancy-tracking apps and websites. \u201cThis research is important because we don\u2019t have a very good handle on what tools pregnant women are using and how they engage with technology,\u201d said Kraschnewski, also an affiliate of the Penn State Institute for Diabetes and Obesity. \u201cWe have found that there is a real disconnect between what we\u2019re providing in the office and what the patient wants.\u201d\n\nKraschnewski calls for figuring out better ways to provide good information to patients. Readers, thoughts? I can imagine such simple solutions \u2014 a receptionist asking for a patient\u2019s email or phone number during that first phone call and sending over the office\u2019s favored online resources, including instructions for taking prenatal vitamins and avoiding alcohol. But that didn\u2019t happen when I was pregnant a decade ago. In your experience, is it happening more now?", "article_metadata": {"description": "A small new study finds that pregnant women are ravenous for better information earlier on in their pregancies, before their first appointment with the obstetrician.", "og": {"site_name": "commonhealth", "description": "A small new study finds that pregnant women are ravenous for better information earlier on in their pregancies, before their first appointment with the obstetrician.", "title": "Study: Pregnant Women Hungry For Better Info Earlier On", "url": "http://commonhealth.wbur.org/2014/07/pregnant-info-early", "image": "http://s3.amazonaws.com/media.wbur.org/wordpress/15/files/2011/03/pregnantshade.jpeg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://commonhealth.wbur.org/2014/07/pregnant-info-early", "image": "//s3.amazonaws.com/media.wbur.org/wordpress/15/files/2011/03/pregnantshade.jpeg", "site": "@commonhealth", "card": "summary", "title": "Study: Pregnant Women Hungry For Better Info Earlier On"}, "DC.date.issued": "2014-07-08", "date": "Tue, 08 Jul 2014 13:38:35 -0400", "fb": {"admins": 1549080028, "app_id": 134067973330252}, "msvalidate.01": "D02D46BAEDB3F81FC1B1DE2A8CB69551"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe29f0\"", "article_summary": "Study: Pregnant Women Hungry For Better Info Earlier OnThe \u201c+\u201d sign pops up on your pregnancy test.\nThe researchers conducted four focus groups, totaling 17 pregnant women \u2014 all of whom were over 18 and owned a smartphone.\nHowever, there\u2019s so much little stuff when you\u2019re pregnant, especially for the first time.\nWrites one pregnant friend: \u201cMy docs are wonderful and insanely knowledgeable, and I call them for the big stuff.\nHowever, the women were unsatisfied by the questionable accuracy of the information they found online."}
