The first is the Super Bowl, the biggest event in American sports. The second, a town-sponsored block party, is reluctantly unaffiliated.\n\nOfficially, the latter event is the \u201cMeadowlands Tailgate Party,\u201d though some posters refer to the \u201cGame Day Tailgate.\u201d It doesn\u2019t really matter what you call it, as long as you don\u2019t call it a Super Bowl Party \u2013 the NFL keeps that trademark under tight control, and it has only lent its prestige to one party in tiny East Rutherford, population 9,000. Even the ice artist booked for the day has been warned not to carve a likeness of the Vince Lombardi trophy or the iconic Roman numerals XLVIII.\n\n\u201cAs far as the NFL is concerned, it\u2019s in New York,\u201d said Jim Wald, the manager of Blarney Station, a pub in East Rutherford\u2019s lively little downtown that is sponsoring Sunday\u2019s Tailgate Party. The teams that play in the Meadowlands are the New York Giants and New York Jets. The blimps will float over Midtown, not Montclair.\n\nIt\u2019s an old annoyance, but one that\u2019s become particularly acute as Super Bowl attention turned to the New York region. Football is a civic affair in the old towns around the Meadowlands, but the approach to the Big Game has been bittersweet. Residents know there wouldn\u2019t be a Super Bowl on the Hackensack River if Midtown weren\u2019t just over the hills. But neither would there be a party in Manhattan if there weren\u2019t a football stadium in New Jersey. With the Big Game in their back yard, those who live closest feel they have been forgotten.\n\nPerhaps conflict was inevitable from the moment the Super Bowl was awarded to the region. New York has the glamor; New Jersey the gridiron. The NFL has strained to put both states in the spotlight: the Garden State is housing both teams in Jersey City, and media day took place at the hockey arena in Newark.\n\nBut it\u2019s evident that the league considers New York City the more attractive selling point, and the perception of slight has reached the highest level of state politics across the Hudson. \u201cEvery time I hear a player or broadcaster say he\u2019s heading to New York for the Super Bowl, it makes my ears bleed,\u201d N.J. Senator Robert Menendez said at a press conference last week, alongside Sen. Cory Booker and James Cassella, the mayor of East Rutherford. \u201cApparently, the NFL needs a geography lesson, too.\u201d In a moment that perfectly summed up New Jersey\u2019s inferiority complex, the mayor of Jersey City, welcoming the Denver Broncos to town, was mistaken for a fan.\n\nBut who needs the NFL to have a party? \u201cWe have the Game,\u201d East Rutherford councilman Joel Brizzi recalls thinking. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to do something, these people are going to be coming to our town!\u201d\n\nSunday\u2019s festivities, which Brizzi has been organizing for several months, will feature heated tents, food trucks and live music (Hudson County\u2019s \u201cThe Nerds,\u201d plus the B Street Band, a Springsteen tribute) and contests in snowball throwing and cannoli eating. As Brizzi remarks, it\u2019s all just steps from the East Rutherford train station \u2014 a quick, car-free trip to a certain football event on the other side of town. The town is hoping to lure a few thousand fans to Park Avenue on Sunday, giving local businesses their taste of the elusive Super Bowl boost, even if they can\u2019t use the Super Bowl name.\n\nAt least eight New Jersey communities in the environs of Meadowlands Stadium have tried to capitalize on the occasion. Montclair invited sportswriters to talk you-know-what at the Beer Bowl Huddle; Ridgewood is hosting a week-long Pre-Game Celebration, which will include ice-skating, snowshoeing, movies, games, a chili cook-off and a marching band performance. Manhattan may have Super Bowl Boulevard; Secaucus is assembling Winter Blast Boulevard.\n\nWithholding the Super Bowl name from these towns is a cosmetic bother, but disguises a more concrete complaint: Where is everybody? Park Avenue in East Rutherford is quiet. Eddie Arroyo, who runs the memorabilia shop Legacy Sports a couple blocks from the train station here, is disappointed. \u201cYou would think that operating a sports memorabilia shop blocks from the Super Bowl would be lucrative,\u201d he said. \u201cYou would think there would be more business but there isn\u2019t. Right now the town is asleep.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "New Jersey is hosting the first-ever cold-weather Super Bowl tomorrow night... but getting few of the benefits", "title": "The \u201cSuper Bowl\u201d that wasn\u2019t: How NJ is getting shafted on its biggest Sunday ever", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "New Jersey is hosting the first-ever cold-weather Super Bowl tomorrow night... but getting few of the benefits", "title": "The \u201cSuper Bowl\u201d that wasn\u2019t: How NJ is getting shafted on its biggest Sunday ever", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/02/01/the_super_bowl_that_wasnt_how_nj_is_getting_shafted_on_its_biggest_sunday_ever/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/02/superbowl_dream_city.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "New Jersey is hosting the first-ever cold-weather Super Bowl tomorrow night... but getting few of the benefits", "title": "The \u201cSuper Bowl\u201d that wasn\u2019t: How NJ is getting shafted on its biggest Sunday ever", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/02/superbowl_dream_city.jpg", "creator": "@HenryGrabar", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Henry Grabar", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Dream City, Editor's Picks, New Jersey, New York, NFL, Super Bowl, super bowl 2014, Super Bowl XLVIII", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: Dream City, Editor's Picks, New Jersey, New York, NFL, Super Bowl, super bowl 2014, Super Bowl XLVIII, Business News, NewsThere will be two parties in East Rutherford, N.J., on Sunday.\n\u201cYou would think that operating a sports memorabilia shop blocks from the Super Bowl would be lucrative,\u201d he said.\nThe first is the Super Bowl, the biggest event in American sports.\nResidents know there wouldn\u2019t be a Super Bowl on the Hackensack River if Midtown weren\u2019t just over the hills.\nWithholding the Super Bowl name from these towns is a cosmetic bother, but disguises a more concrete complaint: Where is everybody?"}
