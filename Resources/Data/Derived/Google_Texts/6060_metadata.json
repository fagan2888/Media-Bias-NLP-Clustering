They are calling upon women to don black face masks and take a \u201cselfie.\u201d\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nThe political art project began as a private experiment when Najm began wearing niqab (erroneously referred to as \u201chijab,\u201d which is just a headscarf) in her neighborhood; she encountered some hostile responses. \u201cGo home!\u201d\n\nAt that point, Najm decided that concealing her facial identity was an act of assertive liberation and a challenge to a presumably \u201ctolerant\u201d America. She launched a hashtag #DamniLookGood and asked other women, both Muslim and non-Muslim\u2013men too\u2013to don niqab as \u201can exercise in tolerance.\u201d\n\nSome women who tried on the black niqab and close black head covering found it \u201csexy\u201d to be concealed. Najm also points out that you can wear \u201ccrappy clothes\u201d underneath and be very \u201ccomfortable.\u201d (Here she must be talking about a full body covering as well).\n\nThe two artists claim, on their website, that a woman can \u201cchoose\u201d to wear niqab and when she does she is \u201cin complete control of her sexuality, and ultimately that\u2019s what makes her so beautiful.\u201d\n\nWestern adventurers and artists have a long history of \u201cslumming.\u201d They go \u201cnative,\u201d both politically and in terms of couture. Lawrence of Arabia and Isabelle Eberhardt both dressed the part of Arabs. European and American leftists marching against America and for \u201cPalestine\u201d often don keffiyas which they wear around their necks but which can also be worn as face and head masks.\n\nI wonder what Afridi and Najm would have to say to all those girls and women who have been honor murdered for refusing to face-veil, to wear hijab (headscarves) or because their wore their veils improperly; or to those fifteen Saudi teenage girls who tried to flee the fire burning down their schoolhouse but were pushed back in to their deaths because the Morality Police did not want them to survive if they were, even temporarily, naked-faced.\n\nThese artists and all who agree with them are treating what is mainly a forced choice in the Muslim world (and in Muslim communities in the West), as a potentially free choice. They are, in essence, donning the equivalent of \u201cblack face,\u201d or slave chains, and saying that this feels good\u2013in New York City, where they are only play-acting, and can remove their face veils without any negative consequence.\n\nSome tribal, ethnic, and religious customs violate American law (e.g. polygamy, female genital mutilation, forced child marriage, purdah\u2013 honor based violence, including honor killing\u2013and face veiling). Although I do not want the government telling women what to wear and what not to wear, I have nevertheless concluded that the face veil (\u201cniqab\u201d) is both a security and health risk as well as a violation of women\u2019s human rights to participate in public society.\n\nIn our times, the Islamic face and body veil signify the utter subordination of women. It is also the flag of Jihad, a struggle that is not known for being tolerant to women, infidels, or to the \u201cwrong\u201d kind of Muslim.\n\n\u201cTolerance\u201d and religious reciprocity would consist of these two New York City artists being able to drive by themselves in Saudi Arabia, naked-faced and without a male escort; being able to practice Christianity without being stoned to death or executed in Sudan; being able to run a shelter for battered women in Kabul or Herat, naked-faced, without being shot dead; being able to demand an education for girls without the Pakistani Taliban shooting a bullet into your brain. While I am glad that Malala Yusufzai just won a Noble Peace Prize for her extraordinary heroism in this regard, I must point out that it is Westerners, not the Pakistani Taliban, who gave her an award.\n\nWe must be careful that our \u201ctolerance\u201d for the \u201cintolerant\u201d does not lead to even more \u201cintolerance.\u201d\n\nOtherwise, we are merely play-acting, just like these two New York artists are doing.", "article_metadata": {"description": "New York Artists' Niqab Hashtag Campaign Ignores Garment's Long History of Oppression", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "New York Artists' Niqab Hashtag Campaign Ignores Garment's Long History of Oppression", "title": "New York Artists' Niqab Hashtag Campaign Ignores Garment's Long History of Oppression - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Peace/2014/10/14/ByiT5r0CMAEFdTOjpg.jpg", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2014/10/14/new-york-artists-niqab-hashtag-campaign-ignores-garment-s-long-history-of-oppression/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "New York Artists' Niqab Hashtag Campaign Ignores Garment's Long History of Oppression", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Peace/2014/10/14/ByiT5r0CMAEFdTOjpg.jpg", "title": "New York Artists' Niqab Hashtag Campaign Ignores Garment's Long History of Oppression - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": ",National Security,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "National Security", "published_time": "2014-10-14T08:18:00-07:00", "categories": "National Security"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9848\"", "article_summary": "We must be careful that our \u201ctolerance\u201d for the \u201cintolerant\u201d does not lead to even more \u201cintolerance.\u201dOtherwise, we are merely play-acting, just like these two New York artists are doing.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERTwo Upper West side artists think New York women should try wearing face masks, also known as \u201cniqab.\u201dTheir names are Saks Afridi and Quinza Najm.\nShe launched a hashtag #DamniLookGood and asked other women, both Muslim and non-Muslim\u2013men too\u2013to don niqab as \u201can exercise in tolerance.\u201dSome women who tried on the black niqab and close black head covering found it \u201csexy\u201d to be concealed.\n\u201cGo home!\u201dAt that point, Najm decided that concealing her facial identity was an act of assertive liberation and a challenge to a presumably \u201ctolerant\u201d America.\nThey are, in essence, donning the equivalent of \u201cblack face,\u201d or slave chains, and saying that this feels good\u2013in New York City, where they are only play-acting, and can remove their face veils without any negative consequence."}
