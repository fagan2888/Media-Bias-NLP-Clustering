LOS ANGELES — Actress and comedian Anne Meara, 85, whose comic work with husband Jerry Stiller helped launch a 60-year career in film and TV, has died.

Jerry Stiller and son Ben Stiller say Meara died Saturday. No other details were provided.

The Stiller family released a statement Sunday describing Jerry Stiller as Meara’s “husband and partner in life.”

“The two were married for 61 years and worked together almost as long,” the statement said.

The couple performed as Stiller & Meara on “The Ed Sullivan Show” and other programs in the 1960s and won awards for the radio and TV commercials they made together.

Meara was twice nominated for an Emmy Award for her supporting role on “Archie Bunker’s Place,” along with two other Emmy nods, most recently in 1997 for her guest-starring role on “Homicide.” She won a Writers Guild Award for co-writing the 1983 TV movie “The Other Woman.”

She also appeared in dozens of films and TV shows, including a longtime role on “All My Children” and appearances on “Rhoda,” “Alf” and “The King of Queens.” She shared the screen with her son in 2006’s “Night at the Museum.”

Meara also had a recurring role on CBS’s “Murphy Brown” and on HBO’s “Sex and the City.” In 1975, she starred in CBS’ “Kate McShane,” which, though short-lived, had the distinction of being the first network drama to feature a female lawyer.

Born Sept. 20, 1929, in Brooklyn, she was a red-haired, Irish-Catholic girl who struck a vivid contrast to Stiller, a Jewish guy from Manhattan’s Lower East Side who was two years older and 4 inches shorter.

Besides her husband and son, Meara is survived by her daughter, Amy, and several grandchildren.

The family statement said: “Anne’s memory lives on in the hearts of daughter Amy, son Ben, her grandchildren, her extended family and friends, and the millions she entertained as an actress, writer and comedienne.”
