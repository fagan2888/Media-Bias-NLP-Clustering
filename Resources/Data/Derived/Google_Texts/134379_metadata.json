He has a legitimate chance to surpass his career-high of 16 victories, set in 2009 and again in 2013.\n\nAnd while other pitchers cringe at the mere thought of pitching at Coors Field, De La Rosa revels in it. He improved to 9-2 with a 3.19 ERA in 13 starts at Coors Field this season. In his career, De La Rosa is 44-14 at Coors. His 44 wins are the most all time at the ballpark. That hometown performance will certainly factor into the Rockies\u2019 decision-making when De La Rosa becomes a free agent at the end of the season.\n\n\u201cJorge is tough, tougher than some people might think,\u201d pitching coach Jim Wright said. \u201cHe knows how to get through an outing, and he knows how to win a ballgame. Plus, he\u2019s not intimidated by this place. He thinks he can outlast the other pitcher.\u201d\n\nDe La Rosa did that again Wednesday night, utilizing his baffling changeup and outperforming Royals lefty Danny Duffy. De La Rosa has now pitched at least six innings in 11 consecutive starts.\n\n\u201cHis changeup is his money pitch,\u201d manager Walt Weiss said. \u201cHe speeds hitters up with his cutter, but the changeup has been really good for Jorge. Every once in a while he\u2019ll pop a fastball in there at 95 (mph) or sneak a curveball in there. He\u2019s had it all working, and he\u2019s been ridiculously good here.\u201d\n\nDe La Rosa threw eight innings, allowing two runs on five hits and inducing four double plays \u2014 tying the franchise record for a starting pitcher. He wanted to go for the complete game, but Weiss pulled him after 103 pitches.\n\n\u201cI wanted to try, but I respect their decision,\u201d De La Rosa said.\n\nHe got rocked by a solo homer by Alex Gordon to lead off the second and gave up another run in the fourth, when Billy Butler led off with a double and then scored on a sacrifice fly by Josh Willingham.\n\nBut Colorado\u2019s offense delivered, as it usually does when De La Rosa is on the mound. First baseman Matt McBride, called up from Triple-A Colorado Springs on Tuesday, tagged Duffy for a two-out grand slam in the sixth inning, turning a 2-1 Rockies deficit into a 5-2 lead. De La Rosa entered the game getting 6.16 runs of support per nine innings, the best in the majors.\n\nNot so long ago, De La Rosa too often allowed his emotions to get in the way of his performance. Not the past two seasons, however, as he\u2019s learned to channel his passion.\n\nSaid Wright: \u201cEven though his emotions might get out of control at times, and maybe his anger gets the best of him, sometimes, he still has an attitude of, \u2018I\u2019m coming after you.\u2019 That\u2019s why he can win here.\u201d\n\nThe left-hander is a maddeningly slow worker but highly effective nonetheless. He\u2019s also costly. His $11 million salary is the second highest on the team this season, behind injured shortstop Troy Tulowitzki\u2019s $16 million.\n\nSo the Rockies and the 33-year-old De La Rosa are quickly heading toward a crossroads. In an effort to keep him, the Rockies will have to make De La Rosa a $14 million qualifying offer. That move would ensure draft-pick compensation if De La Rosa were to sign with another team.\n\nBut suppose another team were to offer De La Rosa a two-year, or even a three-year, contract at, say, $20 million to $25 million? Would the Rockies match it?\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know about that right now,\u201d De La Rosa said. \u201cI just want to concentrate on this season.\u201d\n\nOwner Dick Monfort, the man who holds the power and pulls the purse strings, indicated this summer that he wants De La Rosa back. But at what price?\n\nAnd there are others in the organization who aren\u2019t so sure De La Rosa is worth re-signing for big-time money.\n\nAfter De La Rosa\u2019s stellar performance Wednesday night, the debate is bound to get very interesting.\n\nPatrick Saunders: psaunders@denverpost.com or twitter.com/psaundersdp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Jorge De La Rosa improves to 9-2 in 13 starts at Coors Field", "title": "Jorge De La Rosa improves to 9-2 in 13 starts at Coors Field", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/08/20/jorge-de-la-rosa-improves-to-9-2-in-13-starts-at-coors-field/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140820__rockies-mcbridep1.jpg", "height": 490}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140820__rockies-mcbridep1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-20T21:30:41+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T12:22:11+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "And while other pitchers cringe at the mere thought of pitching at Coors Field, De La Rosa revels in it.\nAnd there are others in the organization who aren\u2019t so sure De La Rosa is worth re-signing for big-time money.\nRockies left-hander Jorge De La Rosa has found a home sweet home on the Front Range.\nBut Colorado\u2019s offense delivered, as it usually does when De La Rosa is on the mound.\nHe thinks he can outlast the other pitcher.\u201dDe La Rosa did that again Wednesday night, utilizing his baffling changeup and outperforming Royals lefty Danny Duffy."}
