At Wagner High School, Mr. Harmon spent four years on the wrestling team; to compete, he took off his prosthetic legs and wrestled on his knees.\n\n\u201cI was so close to the ground that no one knew how to defend me,\u201d he said, \u201cand I was so close to your legs that I would grab your legs and pull them to take you down, get a quick two points.\u201d\n\nBut in the three years since he graduated, Mr. Harmon, 21, a kinesiology student at Northeast Lakeview College, has struggled to find opportunities to compete.\n\n\u201cA lot of stuff is for Wounded Warriors, but I\u2019m not a Wounded Warrior,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m a civilian.\u201d\n\nThe Amputee Coalition, a nonprofit support group, estimates that there are 1.9 million amputees in the United States, more than half of them diabetics. But in San Antonio, the most active and visible amputee population are those who lost limbs in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nAccording to the Army Surgeon General\u2019s Office, 1,558 major limb amputations were performed on American soldiers involved in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars from 2002 to the end of 2013. Eighty-three percent suffered lower-limb wounds because of improvised explosive devices. San Antonio\u2019s Wounded Warrior Project gives these amputees the opportunity to play a variety of sports including football, softball and volleyball, but civilians cannot participate.\n\nIn September, Mr. Harmon\u2019s prosthetist told him about the National Amputee Boxing Association. The organization was founded in 2013 by Shaman R. Owensby, an Air Force veteran and athletic trainer who worked with amputees, and Rachel Quintero, a client of Mr. Owensby\u2019s, who has a business background. Mr. Owensby asked one client for his dream list of sports. The client \u201chad always wanted to box,\u201d said Rachel Quintero, the association\u2019s executive director. \u201cWe came to find out that we had a number of guys who showed up who had wanted to do this for years. One of our boxers, he lost his legs at 22, and he had wanted to box, and everyone kept telling him, no, you can\u2019t do it.\u201d\n\nExpanded coverage of Texas is produced by The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit news organization.

The next one is planned for the early part of 2015. The organization also hopes to offer training, whether or not a fighter wishes to compete. The organization has raised $15,000 from private donations and fund-raising parties, with a goal of an operating budget from $40,000 to $50,000 next year.\n\nWhen Mr. Harmon learned of the association, just two weeks before its first event, \u201cI jumped on it,\u201d he said. The week before the match, he went on a strict diet and trained for two hours a day, hitting the heavy bag, shadowboxing and running on his dual prosthetics.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA week later, Mr. Harmon, surrounded by corner men, bounded through the crowd at Cowboys Dance Hall in northeast San Antonio and into the ring. Nine Inch Nails\u2019 \u201cThe Hand That Feeds,\u201d played over the public address system. A minute later, his opponent, Moses \u201cIron Man\u201d Sonera, strode in to the Black Sabbath hit from which he took his nickname. According to Ms. Quintera, 700 people had gathered to watch.\n\nMr. Sonera lost his left foot to a mortar while serving at Kirkuk Air Base in Iraq in 2004. His father had trained him to box in Puerto Rico when he was young, and he had been training to fight since April.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been playing different types of sports,\u201d since his amputation, Mr. Sonera said, \u201cbut this one, I like it. I love boxing.\u201d\n\nWithin a few weeks, he said, he had adjusted to being in the ring on his prosthesis. \u201cAt first, every sport is kind of hard, but after a while, everything comes naturally.\u201d\n\nMr. Sonera faced Mr. Harmon in three one-minute rounds, both men moving nimbly. Mr. Sonera pummeled Mr. Harmon in the first round, but in the second round, Mr. Harmon maintained his balance and took a few aggressive shots. Neither fighter was knocked down, but training and experience won out, with Mr. Sonera taking the fight, 30-27, by the unanimous decision of the three judges.\n\nOther matches at the event were more dramatic. Kelly O\u2019Quinn, a 36-year-old oil field worker from Odessa who trained for two months, knocked down his opponent Kris Biggs, a 31-year-old military veteran who works with a faith-based veterans\u2019 assistance program, several times in their three rounds. Mr. O\u2019Quinn won in the third by technical knockout. Mr. O\u2019Quinn, a self-described \u201cbullfighter-motorcross rider-bar brawler,\u201d said his training was rough, \u201clike learning everything all over again.\u201d But, he said before he entered the ring, \u201cI just want to hit somebody really, really hard.\u201d At the association\u2019s first event, he got the chance to do it.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20141011194434, "twitter": {"description": "The Amputee Coalition, a nonprofit support group, estimates that there are 1.9 million amputees in the United States, more than half of them diabetics.", "title": "Texas Group Helps to Fulfill the Dreams of Amputee Athletes", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/12/us/texas-group-helps-to-fulfill-the-dreams-of-amputee-athletes.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003170218"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/10/12/us/TTCulture/TTCulture-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/12/us/texas-group-helps-to-fulfill-the-dreams-of-amputee-athletes.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003170218", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/12/us/texas-group-helps-to-fulfill-the-dreams-of-amputee-athletes.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "us", "hdl_p": "A Group Helps to Fulfill the Dreams of Amputee Athletes", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/us/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Oct. 11, 2014", "edt": "AddTexas", "org": "Amputee Coalition", "keywords": "Amputation,San Antonio (Tex),Texas,Wounded Warrior Project,Amputee Coalition", "news_keywords": "Amputation,Texas", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Dan Solomon", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/10/12/us/TTCulture/TTCulture-thumbLarge.jpg", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "byl": "By DAN SOLOMON", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "The Amputee Coalition, a nonprofit support group, estimates that there are 1.9 million amputees in the United States, more than half of them diabetics.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/10/12/us/TTCulture/TTCulture-thumbStandard.jpg", "description": "The Amputee Coalition, a nonprofit support group, estimates that there are 1.9 million amputees in the United States, more than half of them diabetics.", "CG": "us", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Oct. 11, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/national/index.html", "section": "U.S.", "modified": "2014-10-12", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/us/index.jsonp", "tag": "Amputee Coalition", "published": "2014-10-11", "section-taxonomy-id": "23FD6C8B-62D5-4CEA-A331-6C2A9A1223BE"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "geo": "Texas", "slug": "12ttculture", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20141012222158, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/12/us/texas-group-helps-to-fulfill-the-dreams-of-amputee-athletes.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/10/12/us/TTCulture/TTCulture-videoSixteenByNine1050.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The Amputee Coalition, a nonprofit support group, estimates that there are 1.9 million amputees in the United States, more than half of them diabetics.", "title": "Texas Group Helps to Fulfill the Dreams of Amputee Athletes"}, "pdate": 20141011, "des": "Amputation", "articleid": 100000003170218, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Texas Group Helps to Fulfill the Dreams of Amputee Athletes", "col": "Texas Monthly", "PST": "News"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd633a\"", "article_summary": "Mr. Sonera pummeled Mr. Harmon in the first round, but in the second round, Mr. Harmon maintained his balance and took a few aggressive shots.\nBut in San Antonio, the most active and visible amputee population are those who lost limbs in Iraq and Afghanistan.\nWhen Mr. Harmon learned of the association, just two weeks before its first event, \u201cI jumped on it,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been playing different types of sports,\u201d since his amputation, Mr. Sonera said, \u201cbut this one, I like it.\nMr. Sonera lost his left foot to a mortar while serving at Kirkuk Air Base in Iraq in 2004."}
