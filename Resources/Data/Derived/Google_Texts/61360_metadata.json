Burnett (6-11) and manager Ryne Sandberg didn\u2019t last long. Both were ultimately ejected when Burnett motioned and yelled toward home plate umpire Chris Guccione after a ball call duringWashington\u2019s four-run second inning.\n\nRendon singled, hit a three-run homer, and doubled in his first three at-bats.\n\nDenard Span, Asdrubal Cabrera and Wilson Ramos each had two of Washington\u2019s 14 hits, and every Nationals starter, including Zimmermann, hit safely.\n\nZimmermann (7-5) held the Phillies to five singles and struck eight without a walk for his 50th career win, and first since June 30th.\n\nHe retired the last 11 batters he faced and left after throwing 97 pitches.\n\nBurnett allowed five runs, one was earned, and three hits in losing his third straight decision.\n\nMarlon Byrd had two hits for Philadelphia, which had won the first two games of the series 10-4 and 2-1.\n\nWashington loaded the bases in the second inning on two walks and an error. After Span drove in a run with a sacrifice fly, Rendon connected on a 3-1 pitch from Burnett for his 14th home run, making it 5-0.\n\nRendon\u2019s blast snapped a nine-game homerless streak for the Nationals, the longest in team history (2005-present).\n\nWhen his first pitch to Jayson Werth following the home run was called a ball, Burnett \u2014 who had already walked two in the inning \u2014 vented his frustration toward Guccione.\n\nAfter Burnett was tossed, Sandberg raced out and heatedly argued with Guccione near home plate, and was soon ejected as well.\n\nBryce Harper\u2019s RBI-single in the third made it 6-0.\n\nRendon\u2019s double was the one of four straight hits that opened a five-run fourth against reliever Phillippe Aumont.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM:\n\nPhillies: Sandberg said outfielder Domonic Brown, suffering from strep throat, is day-to-day.\n\nON DECK:\n\nPhillies: Cole Hamels (6-5, 2.55) has won four straight decisions. He makes his 30th career start againstWashington Sunday. He\u2019s 15-6 with a 2.63 ERA versus the Nationals.\n\nNationals: Stephen Strasburg (7-9, 3.55) is 3-0 with a 1.13 ERA in three home starts against the Phillies dating back to last season.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Anthony Rendon homered and drove in four runs, Jordan Zimmermann pitched seven shutout innings, and the Washington Nationals routed the Philadelphia Phillies 11-0 Saturday night.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Anthony Rendon homered and drove in four runs, Jordan Zimmermann pitched seven shutout innings, and the Washington Nationals routed the Philadelphia Phillies 11-0 Saturday night.", "title": "Nationals rout Phillies 11-0", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/aug/2/nationals-rout-phillies-11-0/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/08/02/phillies-nationals-baseball-jpeg-022c2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/08/02/phillies-nationals-baseball-jpeg-022c2.jpg", "title": "Nationals rout Phillies 11-0", "description": "Anthony Rendon homered and drove in four runs, Jordan Zimmermann pitched seven shutout innings, and the Washington Nationals routed the Philadelphia Phillies 11-0 Saturday night.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Sports, Philadelphia Phillies, Anthony Rendon, Ryne Sandberg, Washington Nationals"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce629\"", "article_summary": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Anthony Rendon homered and drove in four runs, Jordan Zimmermann pitched seven shutout innings, and the Washington Nationals routed the Philadelphia Phillies 11-0 Saturday night.\nRendon\u2019s double was the one of four straight hits that opened a five-run fourth against reliever Phillippe Aumont.\nNationals: Stephen Strasburg (7-9, 3.55) is 3-0 with a 1.13 ERA in three home starts against the Phillies dating back to last season.\nDenard Span, Asdrubal Cabrera and Wilson Ramos each had two of Washington\u2019s 14 hits, and every Nationals starter, including Zimmermann, hit safely.\nZimmermann (7-5) held the Phillies to five singles and struck eight without a walk for his 50th career win, and first since June 30th."}
