They may look like they are really fighting, but it\u2019s really just a charade designed to communicate to constituents and interest groups. The final outcome is preordained.\n\nIn a genuine fight, the outcome is actually uncertain, and the combatants are really annoyed, not just pretending. That kind of fight creates real winners, real losers, and, sometimes, lasting rifts and scars.\n\nThe fight under way right now about trade between Elizabeth Warren and Barack Obama is starting to look more and more like a genuine fight.\n\nPresident Obama got testy in a recent interview with Yahoo! News, calling Senator Warren \u201cabsolutely wrong\u201d and noting, \u201cThe truth of the matter is that Elizabeth is, you know, a politician like everybody else.\u201d\n\nThe Yahoo! News reporter, Matt Bai, said Obama \u201cseemed unusually irritated.\u201d Bai wrote, \u201clike a marriage in which the spouses pretend to be happier than they really are, Obama\u2019s polite alliance with the populist left appears to be suddenly crumbling under the weight of free trade.\u201d\n\nSenator Warren, for her part, responded by accusing Obama of trying to pass a secret deal. She told The Washington Post: \u201cthe president won\u2019t actually let people read the agreement for themselves. It\u2019s classified.\u201d And in a move that can\u2019t have pleased President Obama, she not-so-subtly suggested that Hillary Clinton\u2014his one-time-rival and would-be-successor\u2014has a firmer grasp of the matter: \u201cHillary Clinton in her book raised concerns about precisely this issue.\u201d\n\nAs Obama himself observed, part of the reason this is so raw for the left and labor is that they still haven\u2019t gotten over Bill Clinton and Al Gore\u2019s support, more than 20 years ago, of the North America Free Trade Agreement. If Obama succeeds in getting fast-track authorization from Congress for the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and then succeeds in getting a deal passed, it could be a similarly significant achievement.\n\nIf Obama is looking for a Democratic precedent on the trade issue, he needn\u2019t stop with Bill Clinton or Al Gore. He could go back to John F. Kennedy, who made trade expansion his top legislative priority in 1962, annoying liberals like Arthur Schlesinger Jr. (who called the trade initiative \u201cmistaken\u201d and \u201coverrated.\u201d) As Kennedy wrote in a January 25, 1962, Special Message to the Congress on Foreign Trade Policy, \u201cThe American consumer benefits most of all from an increase in foreign trade. Imports give him a wider choice of products at competitive prices.\u201d Kennedy went on, \u201cthe warnings against increased imports based upon the lower level of wages paid in other countries are not telling the whole story.\u201d\n\nAnd Kennedy concluded, \u201cThis philosophy of the free market\u2014the wider economic choice for men and nations\u2014is as old as freedom itself. It is not a partisan philosophy. For many years our trade legislation has enjoyed bi-partisan backing from those members of both parties who recognized how essential trade is to our basic security abroad and our economic health at home.\u201d\n\nAlas, while being in favor of a free market on trade is bipartisan, so is being against it; a Wall Street Journal editorial points out that Senator Warren, a Democrat of Massachusetts, is joined by Senator Sessions, a Republican of Alabama, in opposing the fast-track trade promotion authority for the president.\n\nGive President Obama credit for taking on Senator Warren rhetorically in favor of free trade. But what about in Congress itself? Will Obama cut deals with individual legislators or twist arms to win their support for fast-track or the Trans-Pacific Partnership the same way he bought support for ObamaCare? With luck, that won\u2019t be necessary. If it is necessary, though, then we\u2019ll get a chance to see for sure whether this Washington fight is merely theatrical or really genuine. Fortunately, it comes close enough to the 2016 presidential election that contenders for that job will need to choose sides, too.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "An economic clash emerges between two liberal titans.", "title": "Barack Obama vs. Elizabeth Warren on Trade", "url": "http://reason.com/archives/2015/05/11/barack-obama-vs-elizabeth-warren-on-trad", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14313755573512.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14313755573512.jpg", "description": "An economic clash emerges between two liberal titans.", "site": "@reason", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Barack Obama vs. Elizabeth Warren on Trade"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "article": {"tag": "HomePage", "published_time": "2015-05-11T20:30:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/ira-stoll"}, "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe108b\"", "article_summary": "The fight under way right now about trade between Elizabeth Warren and Barack Obama is starting to look more and more like a genuine fight.\nGive President Obama credit for taking on Senator Warren rhetorically in favor of free trade.\nNews, calling Senator Warren \u201cabsolutely wrong\u201d and noting, \u201cThe truth of the matter is that Elizabeth is, you know, a politician like everybody else.\u201dThe Yahoo!\nIn a theatrical fight, both sides go through the motions.\nIf Obama is looking for a Democratic precedent on the trade issue, he needn\u2019t stop with Bill Clinton or Al Gore."}
