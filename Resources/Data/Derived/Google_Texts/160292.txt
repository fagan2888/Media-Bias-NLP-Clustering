There’s no love for Jay Cutler, at least not at a pet-adoption charity auction.

The former Broncos and current Bears quarterback’s autographed football received no bids at the Chosen Man’s Best Friend and Factor Felines fashion show and charity event for the Anti-Cruelty Society, according to the Chicago Tribune.

“When it came back, I was surprised it didn’t go, but I didn’t think it was because of who signed the football,” Anti-Cruelty Society president Dr. Robyn Barbiers said to the Chicago Tribune, adding that it wasn’t “a football crowd.”

However on Thursday, someone finally came forward to buy the football for the $100 starting bid. The bidder told the tribune the plan was to give the football to their son as a birthday present.

“We’re happy to report that the signed Jay Cutler football has found its forever home! Thanks to our anonymous donor for supporting The Anti-Cruelty Society,” the organization wrote on Facebook on Friday.
