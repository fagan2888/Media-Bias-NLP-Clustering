They say it's not just adults criminals are going after. Faver says crooks are claiming kids, too.\n\n\"They put their children's name and social on there and it gets rejected because someone else has claimed them,\" said Faver.\n\nSince 2010, about 3 million people have been victims of tax identity theft fraud, according to the IRS. That number is expected to go even higher this year.\n\n\"I just pray to God these people get caught,\" said Katherine Beasley.\n\nBeasley is one of millions that have been ripped off. She lost her husband in 2009. The man who stole her identity knew that and pounced on her payday.\n\nShe said the worst part is that it can happen in a matter of minutes, but the headache can last for months.\n\n\"They'll have to wait six months or so to get their refund because their identity has already been compromised. Somebody has already filed a return and gotten a refund in their name,\" said Faver.\n\nAnother thing to keep in mind this year with the Affordable Care Act, you can be penalized for not having insurance. This year those penalties have doubled.\n\nCopyright 2016 WCNC", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Tax season brings the possibility of a big payday for people, but these days, tax tycoons are finding new ways to get their hands on your refund before you do.", "author": "TEGNA", "og": {"site_name": "WCNC", "description": "Tax season brings the possibility of a big payday for people, but these days, tax tycoons are finding new ways to get their hands on your refund before you do.", "title": "Tax fraud on the rise in Charlotte", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://content.wcnc.com/photo/2016/03/27/ThinkstockPhotos-514620168_1459091445570_1197717_ver1.0_640_360.jpg", "height": 360}, "url": "http://www.wcnc.com/news/local/tax-fraud-on-the-rise-in-charlotte/104564604", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "http://www.wcnc.com", "description": "Tax season brings the possibility of a big payday for people, but these days, tax tycoons are finding new ways to get their hands on your refund before you do.", "title": "Tax fraud on the rise in Charlotte", "image": {"src": "http://content.wcnc.com/photo/2016/03/27/ThinkstockPhotos-514620168_1459091445570_1197717_ver1.0_640_360.jpg"}, "site": "WCNC", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"app_id": 303752136334578}, "keywords": "Local,News,Money,Crime,Crimestoppers,Consumer", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1280"}, "article_summary": "File photoCHARLOTTE, N.C. -- As the April 15 deadline to file tax refunds inches closer, tax thieves are on the prowl.\nSince 2010, about 3 million people have been victims of tax identity theft fraud, according to the IRS.\n\"Once the Social Security is known and you have somebody's name, you can file a tax return,\" said Brad Faver, manager at Liberty Tax Service.\nThat's something Liberty Tax deals with daily.\nTax season brings the possibility of a big payday for people, but these days, tax tycoons are finding new ways to get their hands on your refund before you do."}
