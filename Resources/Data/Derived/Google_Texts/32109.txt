Krauthammer: Well, the desperation and the ad hominems come into play when you don’t have any arguments. the 2010 election, the shellacking the Democrats took was about ideology. It was about liberal overreach–the stimulus, Obamacare, over-taxation, over-regulation, and we know what the result was. that set off this counterreaction called the Tea Party. And what we’re seeing now six years later is an election that’s not only about ideology. It is a rejection of hyper-liberalism, but there’s now an overlay of sheer incompetence.

In the second year of this administration, 2010, all of this stuff was aspirational. It was in the future. well, now we’ve seen six years of Obamaism and actually the problem is not just the ideas and the ambitions, it’s the fact they are just incompetent. Remember in 1988, Michael Dukakis said ‘this election isn’t about ideology, this is about competence. That’s because if you’re a liberal, you don’t want it about ideology. You won’t even use the word.

Now we’ve seen six years of governance. And now we’ve seen this string of incompetence. Everything from Obamacare to the VA scandal to the secret Service/keystone cops routine where they leave the front door to the White House open. and now it’s kind of crystallize crystallized in Ebola with the overpromising, the running around, the contradictions and now we get the appointment of the ebola czar. Has anybody seen the guy? I’ve been saying he’s now in self-quarantine. Everything that they have had.

So I mean it’s not just that they are the party in government, they are the party of government. it’s not just their values are wrong, their ambitions for government are wrong. They can’t run the damn thing! And that’s why there’s this huge resentment against the Democratic Party and that’s why they’ve got to start calling people names.
