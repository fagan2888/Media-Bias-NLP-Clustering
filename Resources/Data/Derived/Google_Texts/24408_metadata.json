Susana Martinez and former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum (R), the crowd erupted in applause and chanted his name in an uncharacteristic scene for a candidate considered an underdog in the presidential race.\n\n\u201cBefore I begin, a public service announcement, because this has been happening at all of our rallies,\u201d Rubio said, his voice cracking as the crowd continued to cheer. \u201cDon\u2019t lock your knees while you\u2019re standing or you\u2019ll pass out. People have passed out, I just wanted you to know,\u201d he added with a smile.\n\nAs Rubio launched into his stump speech, it was clear the first-term senator was restraining himself, trying not to wage another personal attack on Republican front-runner, Donald Trump like he had been doing on the campaign trail recently. One of Rubio\u2019s verbal assaults on the business mogul, saying he has \u201csmall hands\u201d -- and implying that it extends to other parts of Trump\u2019s body -- took center stage at the GOP Debate on Thursday in Detroit, drawing criticism for lowering the tone of the nationally important occasion.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got to take at least one shot, you\u2019ve got to give me at least one shot on Trump, all right,\u201d Rubio said, in an indication that he was attempting to curb the attacks on his main rival on the stump. \u201cOur next commander-in-chief cannot be Donald Trump because he thinks the nuclear triad is a rock band from the \u201980\u2019s. I had to do it, it was so fun.\"\n\nRubio won just one state on Super Tuesday, leaving the Florida Republican with a nearly impossible path to the GOP nomination.\n\nThe junior senator continued to take on Trump a handful of times throughout the evening, sometimes without even naming him, comparing their stances on several issues, while also throwing in some humor.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m taking this campaign seriously. If you go on my website, we have like real public policy,\u201d Rubio said as the crowd burst into laughter. \u201cI know it\u2019s shocking, but we do\u2026 on healthcare, I don\u2019t just talk about the lines around the state, I have a real plan to repeal and replace Obamacare once and for all,\u201d he added, in a clear dig at Trump.\n\nAlthough Rubio has defended making jokes at Trump\u2019s expense, voters in Missouri have noticed he toned down some of his attacks on the billionaire TV star, sticking mainly with comments comparing policy differences on Friday.\n\n\u201cI think his tone cooled down after last night,\u201d said Nathan Ryan, 18, of Pleasant Hill, Missouri. \u201cHe got stuck in some fights in the debate that he really shouldn\u2019t have been in. I think he should attack Trump, but keep it on policy.\u201d\n\nRyan said he\u2019ll continue to support Rubio at the polls on March 15, but took issue with the way he stooped to Trump\u2019s level in lodging personal attacks.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"Our next commander-in-chief cannot be Donald Trump because he thinks the nuclear triad is a rock band from the \u201980\u2019s.\"", "sailthru.expire_date": "2016-03-06 13:19:14 -0500", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "\"Our next commander-in-chief cannot be Donald Trump because he thinks the nuclear triad is a rock band from the \u201980\u2019s.\"", "title": "Voters in Kansas, Missouri Not Ready To Write Off Marco Rubio Just Yet", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/marco-rubio-kansas-missouri_us_56db05fbe4b0000de404d68b", "image": "http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/2000_1000/56db06601e000087007035db.jpeg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/2000_1000/56db06601e000087007035db.jpeg", "height": 1000}, "title": "Voters in Kansas, Missouri Not Ready To Write Off Marco Rubio Just Yet", "description": "\"Our next commander-in-chief cannot be Donald Trump because he thinks the nuclear triad is a rock band from the \u201980\u2019s.\"", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@HuffPostPol"}, "sailthru.date": "2016-03-05 13:19:14 -0500", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=us_56db05fbe4b0000de404d68b", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "Marco Rubio,marco rubio 2016,kansas caucuses,missouri primary,2016 republican field,Elections 2016,2016 election", "article": {"section": "Politics", "tag": "Marco Rubio,marco rubio 2016,kansas caucuses,missouri primary,2016 republican field,Elections 2016,2016 election", "published_time": "2016-03-05 13:19:14 -0500", "modified_time": "2016-03-05 13:26:04 -0500"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "article_summary": "As the Florida senator took the stage on Friday night with New Mexico Gov.\nIf you go on my website, we have like real public policy,\u201d Rubio said as the crowd burst into laughter.\nRubio won just one state on Super Tuesday, leaving the Florida Republican with a nearly impossible path to the GOP nomination.\nOVERLAND PARK, Kansas -- A fire marshal would likely disapprove of the thousands of voters crammed into a hotel ballroom, overflowing down the hall, waiting for Marco Rubio to begin his rally in the Sunflower state ahead of Saturday's Kansas caucuses.\n\u201cI think his tone cooled down after last night,\u201d said Nathan Ryan, 18, of Pleasant Hill, Missouri."}
