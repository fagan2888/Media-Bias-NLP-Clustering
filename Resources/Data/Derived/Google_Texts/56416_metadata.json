On the Wind River Reservation in Wyoming, the Parent Leadership Training Institute is arming parents with the tools to bring changes within the schools and communities.\n\nThe program is gaining momentum around the country, but Wind River is the first reservation to host the program. Harris, who was a participant in the reservation's first session, said: \u201cPLTI gives us a voice; we learn to use our voice, we learn to speak up. We don\u2019t express ourselves publicly a lot of times, and in this class we had to speak in front of the group on a subject near and dear to you. I have taken speaking classes in college, but this was different,\u201d Harris said.\n\nThe program originated 25 years ago, when Connecticut\u2019s Elaine Zimmerman was given the challenge to improve childhood education in that state. After a year of interviews and study groups, Zimmerman found that parents had great ideas for improving education but didn\u2019t know how to put those ideas into action. Always working interracially and with underprivileged parents, Zimmerman said, \u201cWe removed barriers like childcare and held dinner meetings with parents. Parents were predictably shy, but when they began to see the event was safe, they came forward with really exciting ideas.\u201d\n\nJust as the energy and ideas were flowing, someone would say, \u201cBut I am just a parent.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt happened in every meeting, throughout the entire year,\u201d Zimmerman reported.\n\nRecognizing that empowerment was critical to parent success, she developed the Parent Leadership Training Institute to teach parents everything they need to know to challenge the system and successfully rally for their children.\n\nIn 2012, Harris picked up a brochure from the Wyoming Department of Health and took the PLTI training to become a facilitator, and then revamped the program to suit the reservation. \u201cWe restructured it, used the basic title and changed the wording so we can relate to it in the way we think,\u201d Harris said.\n\nPLTI taught the participants how to open the doors to change, and gave them a \u201ctoolkit\u201d of knowledge to use on and off the reservation. \u201cThe reservation is our family but we have to learn how things are done (off-reservation) in Riverton. We need to know about the budgets, building your community, learning how the state and city works. People say you don\u2019t need to know this, but you do, and you learn that as you get older,\u201d Harris said.\n\nBut the class is not just about sitting and learning. Participants develop a program based on their own interests and strengths, and learn how to bring their program to fruition. Grandfather Donn Little, Oglala, took the class because he has a granddaughter in the school system. His program, called The Grandfathers, takes place in the Arapaho schools and involves other grandfathers from Wind River including Aloysious Bell and Wayne C-Hair. The Grandfathers will even be featured in an upcoming PBS special.\n\n\u201cThe Grandfathers have a very simple purpose,\u201d Little explained. \u201cWe have the premise that grandchildren are sacred and with that belief, we as grandfathers must impart a lot of stories, tradition, duties, and responsibilities; and it is all based in being positive. We are the wisdom keepers, who impart life ways,\u201d Little said, and explained that PLTI gave him more insight \u201cand the wherewithal to have an influence in the schools.\n\n\u201cNow they invite us into the school board meetings and they ask us our opinions,\u201d Little said, adding the program is growing and becoming more popular in Wind River. \u201cPeople are getting interested and more involved. We just had a meeting with one of the tribal leaders, so we are moving in that direction. People who take the training are positive, engaging, team players. There were a lot of young women in there, and these are going to be the future leaders, advocates in school and education programs.\u201d\n\nThe programs developed by the participants run the gamut. From a tribal member who trains goats as pack animals for use while leading teens on hikes and camping trips, to a woman who was so shy she could barely speak at the beginning of the program and is now taking the lead in developing a program for disabled children.\n\nHarris\u2019s program brought \u201cBountiful Baskets\u201d for fresh fruit and vegetables to Fremont County. \u201cWe were traveling every two weeks, 100 miles to Thermopolis in Hot Springs County, to get our baskets. I went online to open a site, I took the training, because on the reservation we have such a high diabetes rate. Now I take flyers around to different organizations, and it\u2019s like a food co-op. Now Riverton has two sites, and there are five other sites. I love it, I always wonder what we are going to get,\u201d she said.\n\nThe benefits to the community are as varied as the programs they develop. \u201cPLTI brings to the surface problems we don\u2019t talk about. We became like family, and what happens in the meetings stays in the meetings. We found out that we all had so many of the same problems, and things came to the surface. It brought to light the things we don\u2019t talk about and pretend don\u2019t go on.\u201d Harris said.\n\nBut for Harris, the best part of the program is seeing parents make changes they want to see. \u201cBecause you are not just a parent. You are a very important person; and as so many said, \u2018I didn\u2019t think about that\u2019.\u201d\n\nFor more information about Parent Leadership Training, visit the website.", "article_metadata": {"description": "On the Wind River Reservation, the Parent Leadership Training Institute is arming parents with the tools to bring changes to the school and community.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "leeanne", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/01/27/empowering-parents-brings-community-change-wind-river-153265", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/wyoming-parent-leadership-training-graduation.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "Empowering Parents Brings Community Change in Wind River"}, "dcterms.date": "2014-01-27T09:00-05:00", "dc": {"title": "Empowering Parents Brings Community Change in Wind River"}, "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/01/27/empowering-parents-brings-community-change-wind-river-153265", "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Wind River Indian Reservation, Native American Education, Native American students", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.title": "Empowering Parents Brings Community Change in Wind River"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdee5\"", "article_summary": "Always working interracially and with underprivileged parents, Zimmerman said, \u201cWe removed barriers like childcare and held dinner meetings with parents.\nOn the Wind River Reservation in Wyoming, the Parent Leadership Training Institute is arming parents with the tools to bring changes within the schools and communities.\nThe program is gaining momentum around the country, but Wind River is the first reservation to host the program.\nHis program, called The Grandfathers, takes place in the Arapaho schools and involves other grandfathers from Wind River including Aloysious Bell and Wayne C-Hair.\nBut for Harris, the best part of the program is seeing parents make changes they want to see."}
