Over at the Competitive Enterprise Institute\u2019s blog, Ryan Young gives a list of 66 new regulations produced in a week:\n\nIt was a short work week because of the Veterans Day holiday, but agencies still added nearly 1,700 pages to the 2013 Federal Register, which is on track to be the fifth-largest ever despite a two-week shutdown.

What is not a mystery is how damaging an aggressive regulatory state can be. Tyler Cowen had a piece in the New York Times this past weekend on the need to get rid of old regulations and how to go about it. He writes:\n\nThe point isn\u2019t that we should eliminate all regulation or give up on clean air and water. In fact, we may need tougher guidelines \u2014 albeit simpler ones \u2014 to govern what is permissible for activities like financial risk-taking or burning coal. Still, a paring back of regulation in many areas, based on clearer priorities, seems in order. The Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, within the White House, has advocated a retrospective review of unnecessary regulations. That\u2019s a good idea, but the office has a full-time staff of only about 50, and its budget, adjusted for inflation, has declined since the early 1980s. The regulatory agencies outspend the office by a factor of about 7,000. . . .

What we need today is the selective pruning of bad regulations. . . . Better bureaucratic incentives are needed. Agencies are now motivated to generate regulation after regulation, because those are the formal assignments set before them. One possible step forward would be to require agencies to submit plans for retiring some fraction of their regulations over the next few years, and to reward these agencies for seeing this process through.\n\nThis would be a first step in the right direction, but we would need something more radical to change the incentives regulators have to regulate for no good reason.\n\nCowen reminds liberals that over-regulation is prevalent in the public sector, too, and is preventing the government from doing some of the things they would like to see accomplished, like building a functioning HealthCare.gov website:\n\nThe tangle known as government procurement has exacerbated problems with the Affordable Care Act\u2019s health insurance exchanges. The required formal processes made it difficult to hire the best possible talent, led to nightmare organizational charts and resulted in blurred lines of accountability.

But you can\u2019t walk away, you\u2019re forced to buy, and there\u2019s nowhere else to go.
