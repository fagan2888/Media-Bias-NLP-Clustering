We\u2019re all looking forward to the day we don\u2019t have a bitter partisan cheap-shot artist in the White House, so we decided to just ignore you this time. It\u2019s a common saying that the White House ages its occupants, but Obama acts more and more like a petulant child as the clock runs out on his presidency.\n\nHere\u2019s George W. Bush at his final turkey pardon in 2008, after years of Democrats savaging him in the most vicious terms possible and questioning his very humanity. Somehow he managed to get through it without any partisan cheap shots:\n\nIt\u2019s not just the turkey-pardoning ceremony. The Democrats have done their worst to turn every aspect of Thanksgiving into a bitter political feud. On Monday, the White House actually instructed Americans to turn their Thanksgiving meals into political harangues about gun control.\n\nObama\u2019s political machine has been cranking out ObamaCare talking-points memos for its followers to bring to Thanksgiving dinners for years, inspiring a new annual tradition of left-wing media creating \u201cHow to Talk to Your Right-Wing Relatives On Turkey Day\u201d guides. The Democratic National Committee has a ditzy propaganda website called YourRepublicanUncle.com dedicated to this purpose.\n\nAfter Thanksgiving, it\u2019s full steam ahead into a hyper-politicized Yuletide season for Democrats, with everything from the infamous \u201cPajama Boy\u201d ObamaCare ad\u2014which did, at least, provide some holiday cheer by prompting a slew of hilarious parodies\u2014to the usual dreary effort at purging Christian themes from the Winter Solstice, Year-End Celebration, or whatever they\u2019re trying to rename it this year.\n\nCan\u2019t we just back away from the partisan politics for a few days and enjoy time with our families? What kind of person looks at Thanksgiving tables and thinks, \u201cWe can\u2019t let this valuable social asset go to waste! We need to infuse it with political propaganda and see if we can get families screaming at each other about gun control and socialized medicine!\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s the kind of person who can\u2019t stand the thought of leaving part of Americans\u2019 personal lives in the embrace of faith and family, that\u2019s who\u2014also, politicians haunted by the suspicion their loyal followers have no idea how to interact with normal people.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Obama compared the 2016 presidential cadidates to turkeys during the traditional presidential pardon of a turkey before Thanksgiving.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Obama compared the 2016 presidential cadidates to turkeys during the traditional presidential pardon of a turkey before Thanksgiving.", "title": "Dear Democrats: Please Stop Politicizing Thanksgiving", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/11/Obama-turkey-pardon-Getty.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/11/25/dear-democrats-please-stop-politicizing-thanksgiving/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Obama compared the 2016 presidential cadidates to turkeys during the traditional presidential pardon of a turkey before Thanksgiving.", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/11/Obama-turkey-pardon-Getty.jpg", "title": "Dear Democrats: Please Stop Politicizing Thanksgiving", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Democratic National Committee, democrats, DNC, gun control, obamacare, Thanksgiving, turkey pardon,2016 Presidential Race, Big Government, Breitbart TV,Thanksgiving", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "tag": "turkey pardon", "published_time": "2015-11-25T18:37:53-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,Breitbart TV,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "On Monday, the White House actually instructed Americans to turn their Thanksgiving meals into political harangues about gun control.\nWhat kind of person looks at Thanksgiving tables and thinks, \u201cWe can\u2019t let this valuable social asset go to waste!\nThe Democrats have done their worst to turn every aspect of Thanksgiving into a bitter political feud.\nIt\u2019s a common saying that the White House ages its occupants, but Obama acts more and more like a petulant child as the clock runs out on his presidency.\nWe\u2019re all looking forward to the day we don\u2019t have a bitter partisan cheap-shot artist in the White House, so we decided to just ignore you this time."}
