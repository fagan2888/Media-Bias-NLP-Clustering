This, despite President Obama\u2019s promises (and executive order) to the contrary, and despite the Hyde Amendment itself.\n\nNow, taxpayers can check the released list of the 1,036 plans to see if their insurance plan is forcing them to cover others\u2019 elective abortions. The Susan B. Anthony List\u2019s Lozier Institute provides information on finding the plans here.\n\nAccording to the GAO:\n\n\u201c\u202628 states (including the District of Columbia) [have] no such laws [restricting abortion coverage in insurance plans], in 5 states all QHPs cover non-excepted abortion services; in 15 states some QHPs cover non-excepted abortion services; and in 8 states no QHPs cover non-excepted abortion services. Nationally, 1,036 QHPs in these 28 states cover non-excepted abortion services and 1,062 QHPs do not.\u201d\n\nDespite former HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius\u2019 promise that ObamaCare would be transparent with its abortion funding provisions, the average taxpayer has had no idea how to find out whether or not her plan paid for others\u2019 abortions. The GAO report found:\n\n11 of the 18 plan issuers interviewed as a sample did not provide abortion information to consumers before they enrolled.\n\nNone of the 18 plan issuers interviewed billed the abortion surcharge separately per the law or itemized the fee clearly as abortion.\n\nOne plan issuer was not aware at all of the requirement to file an abortion segregation plan with its state department detailing its abortion accounting methods.\n\nWith the released list of 1,036 plans, taxpayers can at least find out what\u2019s going on. But while this revelation is helpful, it\u2019s information that should have been available in the first place. Additionally, it does nothing to help the plight of families or single persons who need the insurance plan they are on and yet cannot morally participate in abortion.\n\nIt is both wrong and discriminatory to force people to pay for others\u2019 abortions \u2013 with or without their knowledge. The health of Americans\u2019 ought not to be held hostage by \u201cabortion rights.\u201d I should not have to pay for someone\u2019s abortion so that I can purchase my child\u2019s breathing medication. My friend should not be forced to pay for someone\u2019s abortion so that she can afford pregnancy care for herself.\n\nBarth and Abbie Bracy have brought a lawsuit, through the attorneys of Alliance Defending Freedom, to stop this injustice that is being forced on American taxpayers. The Bracys live in Connecticut, one of the states in which there is no insurance option through ObamaCare other than one that pays for abortion.\n\nTheir complaint presents the issue:\n\nOur Constitution, laws and history forbid the government to penalize a person for his religious convictions. Yet, the Defendants interpret, apply, and enforce the Affordable Care Act to impose substantial penalties on Barth and Abbie Bracy and deny them benefits to which they are entitled because of their sincere religious objection to paying a special surcharge to be used specifically and exclusively to pay for others\u2019 elective abortions. \u2026the government has required the Bracys to purchase a certain type of government-approved health insurance or pay burdensome fines for their refusal. \u2026 However, in order to\u2026avoid the draconian penalties Defendants would impose, the Bracys must also pay a separate fee to be used solely to pay for elective abortions for others.\n\nYou can read the rest of the Bracys\u2019 complaint here, and don\u2019t forget to check out the list to find out if you\u2019re being forced to pay for abortion through your ObamaCare-mandated insurance plan.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Live Action News", "description": "22 Like17 Tweet0 +15According to the Government Accountability Office (GAO), 1,036 insurance plans under ObamaCare fund elective abortions through taxpayer funds.
