Those worried about hidden fees in their retirement accounts might want to investigate FeeX, a service that was launched in the U.S. this spring. Free at the moment, eventually the company plans to introduce optional premium services for which it will charge.

Founders Yoav Zurel, David Weisz, Eyal Halahmi and Uri Levine — Levine being the cofounder of map software provider Waze fame, sold to Google last year for $1.1 billion — brought the new company to the U.S. to pursue its larger market. FeeX began life in Israel in mid-2012.
