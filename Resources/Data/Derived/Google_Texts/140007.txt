U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz used his appearance at this weekend’s Iowa Freedom Summit to excoriate Obamacare, Islamic State militants and that other evil scourge: the Internal Revenue Service.

“The most important tax reform we can do is abolish the IRS,” Cruz said to the delight of attendees at the conservative event.

Turning his aim on Obamacare, the senator said it’s time to “repeal every word” of President Obama’s signature health care legislation.

But Cruz saved his harshest critique for Obama’s handling of Islamic State, the terrorist group some refer to by the acronym, ISIS.

“What’s happening in Iraq is the latest manifestation of the failures of the Obama/Clinton foreign policy,” he said. “What ISIS is doing in Iraq is unspeakable. ISIS is the face of evil. ISIS right now is crucifying Christians in Iraq. Crucifixion is not something that just occurred 2,000 years ago. They are doing it right now today. ISIS is beheading children who are Christians in Iraq.”

Cruz wasn’t just spouting words. He’s also taking action.

The senator filed legislation Friday to ban anyone from returning to the United States after he or she travels overseas to join ISIS or other terrorist groups, according to the Washington Free Beacon.

The bill, known as the Expatriate Terrorist Act, is Cruz’s response to Obama’s State of the Union address, which the senator said showed the president is “detached from reality.”

“President Obama’s approach to foreign policy refuses to acknowledge the threats our enemies pose to our national security, is detached from reality and making the world a more dangerous place,” Cruz said in Iowa. “We’ve seen the grave consequence of the Obama-Clinton-Kerry foreign policy unravel with respect to Iran, Russia, and now Yemen. That is why this week, I am re-filing the Expatriate Terrorist Act, which prevents Americans who have fought abroad for designated terrorist groups from returning to the United States.”
