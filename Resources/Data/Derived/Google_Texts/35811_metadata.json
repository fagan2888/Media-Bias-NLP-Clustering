But the real goal is giving Congress the ability to maximize its meddling in 17 percent of America\u2019s GDP.\n\nEssentially, the SJWs want banks to operate like Obamacare, whose roots go back to when Bill and Hillary Clinton came to Washington in 1993. At the time, 68 percent of doctors were in private practice and health care spending was only 3.8 percent of GDP.\n\nThe Clintons first major legislative initiative was an effort to nationalize healthcare, referred to as \u201cHillarycare.\u201d The policy would have required each U.S. resident to always be enrolled in a health plan, set doctor fee-for-service schedules, and required providers to join multi-state \u201cregional alliances\u201d of health providers. Such a structure would have forced doctors into very large medical groups regulated by the federal government.\n\nHillarycare was thoroughly rejected by Congress, but the Clintons drastically increased the collectivization of medicine though Presidential Executive Orders. The most notable was having the \u201cUS Advisory Commission on Consumer Protection and Quality in the Health Care Industry\u201d adopt the \u201cPatient\u2019s Bill of Rights\u201d in 1998, which set a national default standard in legal liability in evaluating healthcare quality and access.\n\nDue to spiraling malpractice insurance costs, when Clinton left office in 2000, only 57 percent of doctors remained in private practice. Health care costs had risen to 5 percent of GDP and was on a trajectory to rise to 6 percent by the election of Obama in 2008.\n\nObamacare legislation was sold to the public in 2010 as saving the average family of $2,500 per year by restricting corporate profits to cut healthcare inflation. But with inflation running just .1 percent last year, Obamacare insurance premiums rose in 2016 by an average of 13 percent, and the lowest cost plan family deductibles was $11,601.\n\nBut in good news for SJWs, doctors in private practice have plunged to just 33 percent, and health care will reach about 8 percent of GDP when Obama leaves office in 2017, according to Accenture Consulting.\n\nThe Clintons\u2019 other major initiative was the consolidation of the financial services industry through the Gramm\u2013Leach\u2013Bliley Act of 1999, which repealed the Glass\u2013Steagall Banking Act of 1933 that prevented banks from also owning brokerage firms. At the time, there were 8,334 smaller banks that held 40.4 percent of all U.S. bank deposits and 5 very large banks holding just 19.5 percent of deposits.\n\nEleven years and only four months after passing Obamacare, the Obama Administration passed of Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform to supposedly prevent very large banks from getting even bigger. But today there are 5 very large banks that hold 41.1 percent of deposits, and just 5,961 smaller banks that hold only 21.7 percent of deposits.\n\nThose 5 very large banks have thrived due to the Fed\u2019s \u201cfinancial repression policy\u201d that used quantitative easing and other manipulative Fed monetary tools to hold down interest rates below inflation. With their customers tending to be huge multi-national corporations that borrow on a spectacular scale, their small profit percentage has been multiplied on big dollars.\n\nBut small banks have been crushed under low rates, because their business of making small loans to predominantly local family-owned businesses has higher costs as a percentage of dollars loaned.\n\nThe violence of the swings in the U.S. Standard & Poor\u2019s Stock index during Janet Yellen\u2019s discussion of negative-interest-rates was seen by many traders as communicating to the Fed that implementing negative interest rates could create another financial panic and potentially start a bank runs on thousands of small banks.\n\nAfter Yellen\u2019s testimony, U.S. stock markets rallied back from an almost 5 percent mid-week-loss to close the week of February 12 with just a 0.81 percent loss.\n\nBut in Japan, where the central bank has implemented negative interest rates, the Nikkei 225 was down 11.10 percent for the week.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Negative Interest Rates: Obamacare for Banking", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Negative Interest Rates: Obamacare for Banking", "title": "Negative Interest Rates: Obamacare for Banking - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/12/ap_janet-yellen_ap-photo17-wi-e1451678303912.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/02/14/negative-interest-rates-are-obamacare-for-banking/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Negative Interest Rates: Obamacare for Banking", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/12/ap_janet-yellen_ap-photo17-wi-e1451678303912.jpg", "title": "Negative Interest Rates: Obamacare for Banking - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform, executive orders, Glass\u2013Steagall, Gramm\u2013Leach\u2013Bliley Act, Hillarycare, negative interest rate policy, negative-interest-rate, NIRP, obamacare, Patient\u2019s Bill of Rights,Big Government, Breitbart California, Economics,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "Patient\u2019s Bill of Rights", "published_time": "2016-02-14T05:57:58-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,Breitbart California,Economics"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "But in Japan, where the central bank has implemented negative interest rates, the Nikkei 225 was down 11.10 percent for the week.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERNegative interest rates are like Obamacare for banking: cheered by social justice warriors a way to use government to collectivize a fractured industry.\nSocial justice warriors (SJW) like Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) have praised negative interest rates as part of an effort to convert banks into regulated public utilities that they promise will achieve broader lending by drastically restricting profits.\nThose 5 very large banks have thrived due to the Fed\u2019s \u201cfinancial repression policy\u201d that used quantitative easing and other manipulative Fed monetary tools to hold down interest rates below inflation.\nBut today there are 5 very large banks that hold 41.1 percent of deposits, and just 5,961 smaller banks that hold only 21.7 percent of deposits."}
