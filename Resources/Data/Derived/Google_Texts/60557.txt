Comcast

Comcast saw one of its worst PR disasters in recent memory this October. A customer who was charged more than $1,800 for services and equipment he never ordered or used claimed that the Comcast employee who handled his complaints turned around and called his employer, ultimately getting him fired from his job. According to the Consumerist, the customer mentioned the name of the firm where he worked as an accountant during the phone conversations with the Comcast rep, which somehow led to his firing.

This was probably one reason two separate cities have voted to prevent Comcast from serving their residents as a result of its merger with Time Warner Cable.
