However, while it was among the most visited sites in February, there were six other federal and state websites with more traffic.

Government websites offer a variety of services and information. In addition to health insurance, Americans most often search for information about taxes on IRS.gov, health on NIH.gov and retirement benefits on SSA.gov.

Three of the four most populous states, California, New York and Florida, also had among the 10 most visited websites.
