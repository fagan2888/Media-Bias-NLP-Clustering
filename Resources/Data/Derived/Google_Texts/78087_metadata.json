(AP Photo/Mike Groll)\n\nWe don\u2019t think enough about the economic functions of social welfare policy, or about the relationship between the safety net and labor markets, and this hinders our ability to make sense of why some people fight so hard against programs that aid poor and low-income people: We mistake them for anti-welfare ideologues, and dismiss them as cruel or ignorant, but there\u2019s an economic logic to their activism, one that\u2019s revealed if we look at the relationship between welfare and work from both the employee\u2019s and the employer\u2019s perspective. Let me explain.\n\nImagine that we have two workers, worker K and worker O, each with two young children.\n\nWorker K is laid off when the company \u201cdownsizes.\u201d K is nervous, but has some savings, is eligible for Unemployment Insurance benefits, Medicaid, food stamps (SNAP) and TANF, has access to free local day care and lives in a Section 8 apartment, with their monthly rent tied to their income.\n\nWhile K is not living as well as when working, if K were eligible for all of these programs, which would be highly unusual, K will be able to get by. K can pay the rent and buy food and remain insured and with some belt-tightening, will be okay for a while.\n\n[In a world] with very limited social welfare benefits, workers would have no choice but to accept whatever job you offered under whatever conditions.\n\nWorker O, by contrast, is fired, even though O didn\u2019t do anything wrong. O is therefore ineligible for UI. O has no savings, cannot afford insurance, even with a subsidy through the Affordable Care Act, is not eligible for Medicaid or food stamps or TANF, has no reliable, affordable day care and has no access to a housing subsidy. As a result, O is in trouble, and is desperate and perched on the edge of homelessness.\n\nNow, let\u2019s turn our attention to an employer with a job to fill, Z. This job is terrible. It\u2019s minimum wage, has no health benefits, no paid days off or vacation time, has irregular hours \u2014 some weeks you\u2019ll need to work days, some weeks nights (and you won\u2019t know in advance so you can plan), and you\u2019ll get 20 or maybe 30 hours each week, if you\u2019re lucky. There\u2019s no opportunity for upward mobility, it\u2019s a two-hour drive each way, with no reliable public transportation to get you there and the working conditions are unsafe \u2014 there have been lots of injuries there. As I said, it\u2019s a terrible job.\n\nEmployer Z offers unemployed worker K the job. What\u2019s K\u2019s answer? It\u2019s no, of course. Maybe even hell no. Does K say no because K is lazy? No. K says no because this is not a job that will help K raise a family and move up the ladder, and taking it would mean being unable to look for something better, among other things. It is rational under these circumstances, smart even, to turn down this job. If you can. And K can.\n\nNow, Z offers O the job. What does O say? O says yes. Maybe even yes please. Why? Because O does not have any choice. O is desperate. O is in no position to bargain, or to wait for something better.\n\nIt may be even worse than this, because there might be a worker called V who is even more desperate than O. So, V says: \u201cI know you can\u2019t legally pay me less than minimum wage, but if you hire me instead of O, I\u2019ll come in early and work for an hour before punching in, and then after I punch out at night I\u2019ll stay for an extra hour then too.\u201d When workers are desperate, they bid down their own wages.\n\nIn a world with very generous social welfare programs, by contrast, everyone would have the ability to decline work, and if you want to hire someone, the burden would be on you, the employer, to make the job more attractive.\n\nIf you are a worker, would you rather live in a country where most people were in K\u2019s situation, or in O\u2019s? K\u2019s, of course, right? Because in that world, with very generous social welfare benefits, you would have some security, and some bargaining power.\n\nIf you are employer Z, would you prefer to live in a country where most people were in K\u2019s situation, or in O\u2019s? O\u2019s of course, right? Because in that world, with very limited social welfare benefits, workers would have no choice but to accept whatever job you offered under whatever conditions; in a world with very generous social welfare programs, by contrast, everyone would have the ability to decline work, and if you want to hire someone, the burden would be on you, the employer, to make the job more attractive \u2014 you might have to offer higher wages, paid vacation or sick days, a regular schedule, health insurance and opportunities for promotion. Many of those would mean lower profits.\n\nThis is why business and their elected allies fight efforts to expand food stamps or unemployment insurance or TANF. A desperate worker is a cheap and compliant worker.\n\nSo the next time someone is fighting against a proposal to increase the assistance available to poor and low-income people, take their objection seriously and ask, simply, who benefits?", "article_metadata": {"description": "When workers have limited social welfare benefits, they are cheap and compliant, and have no choice but to accept whatever job they are offered.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "BillMoyers.com", "description": "When workers have limited social welfare benefits, they are cheap and compliant, and have no choice but to accept whatever job they are offered.", "title": "Why Big Business Loves Desperate Workers | BillMoyers.com", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://dy00k1db5oznd.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/AP688390902300_crop.jpg", "height": 360}, "updated_time": "2014-07-23T13:10:37-04:00", "url": "http://billmoyers.com/2014/07/23/why-big-business-loves-desperate-workers/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "When workers have limited social welfare benefits, they are cheap and compliant, and have no choice but to accept whatever job they are offered.", "title": "Why Big Business Loves Desperate Workers | BillMoyers.com", "image": "http://dy00k1db5oznd.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/AP688390902300_crop.jpg", "creator": "@BillMoyersHQ", "site": "@BillMoyersHQ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "article": {"section": "Blog", "tag": "widget", "published_time": "2014-07-23T13:10:36-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-23T13:10:37-04:00"}, "pubdate": 20140723}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf9a7\"", "article_summary": "Imagine that we have two workers, worker K and worker O, each with two young children.\nA desperate worker is a cheap and compliant worker.\n[In a world] with very limited social welfare benefits, workers would have no choice but to accept whatever job you offered under whatever conditions.\nBecause in that world, with very generous social welfare benefits, you would have some security, and some bargaining power.\nEmployer Z offers unemployed worker K the job."}
