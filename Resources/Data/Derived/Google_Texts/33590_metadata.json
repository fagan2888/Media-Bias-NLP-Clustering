Jeb Bush is going after two other Republican governors: Chris Christie and John Kasich.\n\nCalled \u201cThree Governors,\u201d the new ad from Right to Rise compares their handling of natural disasters, jobs, the Affordable Care Act and ISIS.\n\n\u201cThree Republican governors,\u201d a narrator intones. \u201cBut which governor won national praise for tough leadership handling nine hurricanes? Which governor made his state No. 1 in job creation? Which governor led the fight to stop Obamacare expansion in his state? And which governor laid out a tough plan to destroy ISIS months before the Paris attacks? Jeb Bush.\u201d\n\nSign up for and more view example\n\nBush left office in 2007, three years before the Affordable Care Act was signed into law, but the ad cites stories referencing a private meeting in 2013 in which he told Florida state lawmakers to oppose the Medicaid expansion.\n\nHe is in direct competition with Christie and Kasich in New Hampshire, the first-in-the-nation primary which many in the Republican Establishment hope will help elevate a moderate to compete with frontrunner Donald Trump.\n\nThe ad is the first significant time that Right to Rise has gone after the other two candidates.

It\u2019s actually flattering.\u201d\n\nRead Next: Bush Super PAC Slams Rubio Attendance Record", "article_metadata": {"apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "A super PAC backing former Florida Gov.
