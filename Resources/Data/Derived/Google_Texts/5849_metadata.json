(AP) - Andrea Petkovic remembered why she started playing tennis and along the way gave everyone else a reminder about how talented she is when she\u2019s at her best.\n\nThe 26-year-old from Germany, who fell from ninth in the world in 2011 to 177th two years later, capped a stunning run to the Family Circle Cup title on Sunday, Petkovic\u2019s first win in three years.\n\nShe outlasted Jana Cepelova 7-5, 6-2 in the finals.\n\n\u201cI just wanted to get back to why I started playing tennis, because I had fun playing it and because I love the sport,\u201d said Petkovic, whose progresses was slowed by several injuries that cost her much of 2012.\n\nThe climb back was painful at times. Petkovic wanted to quit the game after falling in French Open qualifying last year and wondered if she\u2019d ever feel success at the sport again. So she decided to play for fun and not for the wins.\n\n\u201cI just needed to remind myself and it came together this week, and I\u2019m very thrilled about that,\u201d she said.\n\nPetkovic entered this one seeded 14th, ranked 40th in the world and with few expectations about her first clay-court event of the season.\n\nInstead, Petkovic\u2019s powerful forehand and grind-it-out mindset helped her oust three straight top 10 seeds in No. 4 Sabine Lisicki, No. 9 Lucie Safarova and No. 6 Eugenie Bouchard on the way to the finals.\n\nPetkovic used that same formula against Cepelova, a rising 20-year-old from Slovakia competing in her first WTA final.\n\nCepelova led 5-4 and was a point away from capturing the first set. But Petkovic rallied to win that game and begin a run of eight in a row to take control of the match.\n\n\u201cI have to let loose and play like I can,\u201d she told herself.\n\nPetkovic was energized after winning the crucial game and quickly broke serve to move in front. She took the set a game later and continued her run to build a 5-0 lead that Cepelova could not overcome.\n\nFor Petkovic, the victory was more gratifying than her two other career WTA wins because of all her struggles. This \u201cis a different feeling,\u201d she said. \u201cNow, I\u2019m much more grateful. It\u2019s more rewarding.\u201d\n\nPetkovic dropped to the ground when Cepelova\u2019s final shot landed out of play. She jogged to the net to hug her opponent, waved to the crowd and did a celebration dance as fans applauded.\n\nShe let her fun side shine through all week. She joked in postgame comments she might get a bit crazy on the flight back home, dancing with flight attendants and drinking champagne from her latest trophy.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to have champagne and I don\u2019t even drink champagne,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I\u2019m going to have it for the heck of it.\u201d\n\nPetkovic earned $120,000 for her third career WTA victory, which was her first since winning in Strasbourg in 2011.\n\nPetkovic\u2019s victory closed a week of surprises at the Family Circle Tennis Center. Only one of the tournament\u2019s top 10 seeds made it through to the final four and it was the first time a WTA tournament included three semifinalists 20 years old or younger since Amelia Island in 2008.\n\nCepelova had a stunning run of her own, topping world No. 1 Serena Williams on Tuesday night to set the stage for plenty more unexpected results. Cepelova became the Family Circle Cup\u2019s first unseeded finalist since Elena Vesnina in 2011.\n\nCepelova didn\u2019t expect a long visit here, arriving without her coach, trainers and hitting partners. She typically ordered room service at the hotel and had to scrape around to find hitting partners to warm up before matches.\n\n\u201cBefore the tournament, if somebody told me you\u2019ll be in the tournament finals I would not believe them,\u201d Cepelova said with a smile. \u201cBut it was a really nice week.\u201d\n\nCepelova is also projected to move up some 30 spots in the rankings to around 50th in the world when the new list comes out next week, the WTA said.\n\nPetkovic won the title in her second appearance here. She had reached the round of 16 last year, but had to withdraw from a match against Caroline Wozniacki. She was on the phone with her father, Zoran, after the win. Father and daughter now have Palmetto State success in common.\n\nZoran Petkovic was one of the leading singles players at the University of South Carolina in the early 1980s. He told his daughter stories of how Americans on campus loved wearing \u201ccowboy boots and blue jeans,\u201d she recalled, laughing.\n\n\u201cHe was very happy, very emotional,\u201d Andrea Petkovic said of their phone call. \u201cI don\u2019t know if he was tearing up, though.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Andrea Petkovic remembered why she started playing tennis and along the way gave everyone else a reminder about how talented she is when she's at her best.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Andrea Petkovic remembered why she started playing tennis and along the way gave everyone else a reminder about how talented she is when she\u2019s at her best.", "title": "Germany\u2019s Petkovic wins Family Circle Cup", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/apr/6/germanys-petkovic-wins-family-circle-cup/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/04/06/e975658b88df9b0d500f6a7067006907.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/04/06/e975658b88df9b0d500f6a7067006907.jpg", "description": "Andrea Petkovic remembered why she started playing tennis and along the way gave everyone else a reminder about how talented she is when she's at her best.", "card": "summary", "title": "Germany\u2019s Petkovic wins Family Circle Cup"}, "Author": "PETE IACOBELLI", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Sports, Andrea Petkovic, Jana \u010cepelov\u00e1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1a6c\"", "article_summary": "For Petkovic, the victory was more gratifying than her two other career WTA wins because of all her struggles.\nBut Petkovic rallied to win that game and begin a run of eight in a row to take control of the match.\n\u201cBut I\u2019m going to have it for the heck of it.\u201dPetkovic earned $120,000 for her third career WTA victory, which was her first since winning in Strasbourg in 2011.\nPetkovic\u2019s victory closed a week of surprises at the Family Circle Tennis Center.\nPetkovic entered this one seeded 14th, ranked 40th in the world and with few expectations about her first clay-court event of the season."}
