The holiday shopping period this year was shorter than usual, and Americans\u2019 tendency to wait until the last possible second to shop probably didn\u2019t help either.\n\nSome FedEx customers are also still waiting on Christmas deliveries. However, some FedEx customers are able to pick up packages Christmas Day at their local FedEx Express centers.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re sorry that there could be delays and we\u2019re contacting affected customers who have shipments available for pickup,\u201d said Scott Fiedler, a spokesman for FedEx Corp.\n\nNeither company said how many packages were delayed but noted it was a small share of overall holiday shipments.\n\nBetween Thanksgiving and Christmas, FedEx handled 275 million shipments, according to Fiedler. Those that were not delivered in time, he said, \u201cwould be very few.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "UPS and FedEx miss some Christmas deliveries", "title": "UPS and FedEx miss some Christmas deliveries", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/12/25/ups-and-fedex-miss-some-christmas-deliveries/", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131225__2f90afd1-dbdf-482e-a8e8-713ed602f9dflsoriginalph.jpg", "height": 443}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131225__2f90afd1-dbdf-482e-a8e8-713ed602f9dflsoriginalph.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-12-25T11:00:25+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T15:35:44+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe27ba\"", "article_summary": "However, some FedEx customers are able to pick up packages Christmas Day at their local FedEx Express centers.\nSome FedEx customers are also still waiting on Christmas deliveries.\nChristmas will come a little late for some UPS customers, as shipping delays push deliveries into the day after the holiday.\nBetween Thanksgiving and Christmas, FedEx handled 275 million shipments, according to Fiedler.\nNeither company said how many packages were delayed but noted it was a small share of overall holiday shipments."}
