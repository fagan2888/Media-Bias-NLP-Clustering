The Jets gave up the 104th pick and a seventh-rounder (No. 229) to take Petty.\n\n\u201cWe felt good about Bryce today, in terms of where he fell,\u201d general manager Mike Maccagnan said. \u201cWe made a little move just to make sure we got him because in our process we did find that there may have been other teams trying to move up to trade for him.\u201d\n\nThe Jets later dealt their final pick \u2014 No. 224 \u2014 to St. Louis for running back Zac Stacy, who wrote \u201cyikes\u201d on Twitter shortly after the Rams drafted Georgia running back Todd Gurley in the first round Thursday night. The tweet was later deleted, but it was clear Stacy was not happy and wanted a change of scenery \u2014 and the Jets were able to acquire a pass-catching threat out of the backfield.\n\nStacy, who ran for 293 yards last season and caught 18 passes for 152 yards, joins a backfield that includes Chris Ivory, Bilal Powell, Stevan Ridley and Daryl Richardson. Stacy had 973 yards rushing as a rookie in 2013, but took a backseat to Tre Mason last season and figured to see even less action with Gurley on the team.\n\n\u201cWe thought the idea of bringing Zac in with that kind of investment would be very beneficial and increase the competition at that position,\u201d Maccagnan said.\n\nIn the fifth round, New York selected Texas A&M offensive lineman Jarvis Harrison, who played left guard and left tackle in his senior season. With their final pick, No. 223, the Jets took Northwestern State defensive tackle Deon Simon in the seventh round.\n\nNew York drafted USC defensive lineman Leonard Williams in the first round Thursday, and selected Ohio State wide receiver Devin Smith in the second and Louisville linebacker Lorenzo Mauldin in the third on Friday.\n\nPetty, who threw 61 touchdowns the last two seasons, will work with Geno Smith, the starter the last two seasons, veteran Ryan Fitzpatrick, who is recovering from a broken leg that cut short his season last year, and Matt Simms. Coach Todd Bowles recently said the Jets hoped to add another quarterback \u2014 either in the draft or free agency.\n\n\u201cThat was the longest 48 hours I\u2019ve ever had in my life,\u201d Petty said during a conference call shortly after he was selected. \u201cTo get that call was, honestly, unbelievable.\u201d\n\nThe 6-foot-3, 230-pound Petty has an impressive resume: He was the consensus 2013 Big 12 offensive player of the year, led Baylor to a 21-4 record as a starter and consecutive conference championships, and he holds 31 school records. His 1.18 career interception percentage is an NCAA record after throwing for 62 TDs and just 10 INTs in 845 attempts at Baylor.\n\nHe was the fifth quarterback taken, but felt he might have been a bit underrated heading into the draft. Petty played in a quarterback-friendly offense that had some scouts wondering if he could adjust to the complexities of an NFL system.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about the person,\u201d Petty said. \u201cMy desire is to be the best, regardless of what system I\u2019m in. What I was asked to do in college, it was different, but it\u2019s not because I couldn\u2019t do a pro-style offense or West Coast-offense or whatever. It\u2019s what I was told to do, and I did it.\u201d\n\nPetty will not be rushed or be expected to compete for the starting job this season. Bowles reiterated that Smith will enter training camp getting the majority of the first-team snaps and Fitzpatrick the second-team reps, so Petty can sit and learn offensive coordinator Chan Gailey\u2019s system and continue to develop.\n\n\u201cHe has all the parts and pieces we think would make him potentially a good quarterback in the NFL,\u201d Maccagnan said, acknowledging that there will be a learning curve for Petty. \u201cTime will tell what level of player he becomes.\u201d\n\nPetty made a predraft visit to the Jets\u2019 facility, and felt comfortable from the moment he walked through the door.\n\n\u201cIt just kind of felt like home \u2014 home away from home, really,\u201d said Petty, who\u2019s from Midlothian, Texas.\n\nHe said the Jets went through a little bit of Gailey\u2019s spread-style offense during his visit with the team, and saw some similarities to what he ran at Baylor.\n\n\u201cAs far as being able to relate, being familiar with things, it was great,\u201d Petty said. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely an offense that your guys can have fun with.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAP NFL websites: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Jets take Bryce Petty in 4th round, acquire Rams\u2019 Zac Stacy", "title": "Jets take Bryce Petty in 4th round, acquire Rams\u2019 Zac Stacy", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/05/02/jets-take-bryce-petty-in-4th-round-acquire-rams-zac-stacy/", "image": {"width": 478, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150502__STACYp1.jpg", "height": 654}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150502__STACYp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-02T17:52:34+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-24T06:06:48+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Baylor quarterback Bryce Petty was selected with the Jets\u2019 fourth-round pick after the team moved up one spot Saturday in a trade with the Jacksonville Jaguars.\nIn the fifth round, New York selected Texas A&M offensive lineman Jarvis Harrison, who played left guard and left tackle in his senior season.\nFLORHAM PARK, N.J. \u2014 The New York Jets added another quarterback to the mix, and then acquired a versatile running back on the final day of the NFL draft.\n\u201cIt just kind of felt like home \u2014 home away from home, really,\u201d said Petty, who\u2019s from Midlothian, Texas.\n\u201cWe felt good about Bryce today, in terms of where he fell,\u201d general manager Mike Maccagnan said."}
