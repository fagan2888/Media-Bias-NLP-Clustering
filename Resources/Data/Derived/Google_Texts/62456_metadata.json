Teams are comprised of up to seven students, aged from kindergarten to college level, who worked together for several hours a week since last fall to create and realize solutions to their selected Team Challenge.\n\nCoat Check team from Bernatds with their elaborate props designed and built by the team for the \u201cCreature Feature\u201d challenge.

Teams from New Jersey rocked the competition, with 14 of them placing in the top 20 in their respective challenge competitions.\n\nLocal competing teams included: the Technicalities and Destiny Detectives from Immaculate Conception School in the Annandale section of Clinton Township; the Diamond Girls, Polar Peeps, The Sixth Element, The Game of Lifers, Coat Check, Packed with Love, DI Devils, Dinosaurs of Oliver Street and The Hakuna Matatas from the Bernards Township School District; The Fire Breathing Ice Cubes from the Readington Township Public Schools; two teams from the Dr. Albert Einstein Academy in Elizabeth; Back to the Future from Elizabeth High School; and Swaggy Service from Califon School.\n\nAccording to CEO Dr. Chuck Cadle, \u201cDestination Imagination\u2019s goal is to prepare each of our participants for a future world where the jobs they will perform have not been imagined yet. Here at Global Finals, we are celebrating each team\u2019s creative solutions to our annual challenges and we are preparing our students for the individuals they will become, leaders of industry and society.\u201d\n\nTeams are forming now to compete in the 2015-16 Destination Imagination program year.
