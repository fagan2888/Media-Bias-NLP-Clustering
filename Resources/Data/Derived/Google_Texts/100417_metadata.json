Luckily, it\u2019s not too late to pick up a copy of \u201cTed Cruz to the Future,\u201d a 24-page coloring and activity book detailing the \u201clife, principles, values and mission\u201d of the Texas senator. According to the publisher, St. Louis-based Really Big Coloring Books Inc., the book is a \u201cnon-partisan, fact-driven view of how Texas Sen. Rafael Edward \u2018Ted\u2019 Cruz became a U.S. senator and details, through his quotes and public information his ideas for what he believes will help America grow.\u201d\n\nAmong these \u201cnon-partisan\u201d accounts is a text-heavy page featuring the senator\u2019s 21-hour speech on the eve of the government shutdown, describing Cruz as speaking with \u201cclairvoyant precision\u201d about the \u201cquickly approaching Obamacare disaster.\u201d The book even includes a picture of the senator holding a gun, with warnings that the Obama administration will \u201cuse any opportunity\u201d to go after the Second Amendment and \u201cother constitutional rights such as free speech.\u201d\n\nWhile you\u2019d think such a book would be too controversial to pick up steam, the fact is that it\u2019s selling like hotcakes. At the time this story was published, it was still the best-selling children\u2019s coloring book on Amazon\u2019s popular products list, which is updated hourly. Really Big Coloring Books publishes a number of other politically oriented books, including \u201cThe Tea Party Coloring Book for Kids,\u201d \u201cPresident Obama: Yes We Did\u201d and \u201cBeing Gay Is Okay,\u201d but the Ted Cruz book has inexplicably outsold them all. The first run of around 10,000 sold out in 24 hours, and the second went nearly as quickly, publishers said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s wild,\u201d publisher Wayne Bell told US News & World Report. \u201cIt\u2019s almost mind-boggling what is happening with this book.\u201d\n\nReally Big Coloring Books has had to make new hires just to keep up with demand for the book, which is already on its fifth printing this month, according to the article. Despite descriptions of Cruz as a \u201creal life superhero,\u201d the senator was not involved in the publishing of the book, the publisher told the New York Daily News.\n\nBell acknowledged that many copies of \u201cTed Cruz to the Future\u201d may have been purchased as gag gifts, but the title continues to outsell its non-political counterparts, including titles from top franchises like Cat in the Hat, Star Wars and Angry Birds. While the concept of political figures dethroning Dr. Seuss on a list of children\u2019s favorites is surely unusual, it\u2019s not unprecedented. The company also published a coloring book for President Obama\u2019s 2008 inauguration, which was a best-seller, reports the Associated Press, though a second addition published in 2012 flopped.\n\nImage credits: Really Big Coloring Books, Inc.\n\nBased in Philadelphia, Mary Mazzoni is a freelance journalist who frequently writes about sustainability, corporate social responsibility and clean tech.
