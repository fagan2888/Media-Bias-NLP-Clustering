It\u2019s going to be terminated. It\u2019s going to be over. It\u2019s going to be repealed. It\u2019s going to be replaced, and you\u2019re going to have much better healthcare at a much smaller cost.\u201d\n\nTrump lied about the percentage increase in the cost of ACA premiums, but the larger point is that Donald Trump is promising some great mystery healthcare plan. Trump has promised that poor people will not go without healthcare, and this week he endorsed the individual mandate. Trump also has campaigned on the standard Republican myth that buying insurance across state lines will lower costs.\n\nExperts have warned that repealing the ACA would not only cost every American, who signed up for health insurance their coverage, but children age 18-26 would lose their coverage, and those Americans who have gained insurance through the Medicaid expansion would also be at risk of losing their coverage.\n\nThe Republican audience applauded loudly for Trump\u2019s promise to terminate Obamacare, but experts are warning Republicans that ACA repeal would create chaos in the healthcare system. Millions of people who would find themselves newly uninsured would turn to emergency rooms for care.\n\nRepublican voters applauded harming tens of millions of Americans. Donald Trump\u2019s comments about terminating Obamacare should serve as a reminder to every voter of what is on the line in 2016. The election isn\u2019t about a reality television star leading the Republican Party. 2016 is really about the unrelenting Republican quest to harm as many non-wealthy Americans as possible with a destructive agenda.\n\nFor tens of millions of Americans, the 2016 election could be a matter of life and death.", "article_metadata": {"description": "During his South Carolina victory speech, Donald Trump promised that he will terminate the health insurance of 22 million Americans if he is elected president.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Jason Easley", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "During his South Carolina victory speech, Donald Trump promised that he will terminate the health insurance of 22 million Americans if he is elected president.", "title": "Trump Vows To Terminate 22 Million Americans Healthcare In SC Victory Speech", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2016/02/20/trump-vows-terminate-22-million-americans-healthcare-south-carolina-victory-speech.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/trump-sc-victory-2.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-20T21:27:58+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "Editors' Picks,Featured News,Issues,Donald Trump,trump promises to terminate Obamacare,Trump South Carolina victory speech,Trump wins South Carolina,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,barack obama,hillary clinton,bernie sanders,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "Issues", "published_time": "2016-02-20T21:25:59+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-20T21:27:58+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Donald Trump, trump promises to terminate Obamacare, Trump South Carolina victory speech, Trump wins South Carolina"}, "article_summary": "During his South Carolina victory speech, Donald Trump promised that he will terminate the health insurance of 22 million Americans if he is elected president.\nVideo of Trump\u2019s South Carolina victory speech:Trump said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to terminate Obamacare.\nThe Republican audience applauded loudly for Trump\u2019s promise to terminate Obamacare, but experts are warning Republicans that ACA repeal would create chaos in the healthcare system.\nFor tens of millions of Americans, the 2016 election could be a matter of life and death.\n2016 is really about the unrelenting Republican quest to harm as many non-wealthy Americans as possible with a destructive agenda."}
