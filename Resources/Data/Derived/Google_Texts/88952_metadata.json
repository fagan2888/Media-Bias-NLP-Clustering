You should read Jim Newell\u2019s explanation of all the problems with Obama\u2019s strategy, the most significant being the fact that his ultimate goal is the destruction of ISIS. That\u2019s a fine sound bite and it\u2019s likely reassuring to the people who need their presidents to talk tough, but the gulf between saying you\u2019ll destroy a terrorist insurgency and actually accomplishing that goal is yawning.\n\nThere are, however, plenty of politicians who endorse that strategy and want it to be pursued with as much vigor as possible. Sen. Marco Rubio is one of them. He talked to NPR\u2019s Steve Inskeep this morning about the president\u2019s speech, and while he generally approved of what Obama had to say, Rubio was dismayed that the president didn\u2019t say \u201cwe\u2019re going to defeat ISIL no matter what.\u201d\n\nInskeep pressed Rubio on this point and asked whether this was a realistic objective, and Rubio gave a doozy of an answer:\n\nHere\u2019s the relevant transcript:\n\nINSKEEP: And you wish that there was a stronger goal of defeating ISIL, or ISIS, or the Islamic State, no matter what. Is that a realistic goal, senator? Because insurgent groups like this can go on for years and years and years even if they\u2019re weakened. RUBIO: Well, absolutely it\u2019s a realistic goal. It\u2019s been achieved in the past. This very same insurgency was defeated during the awakening in Iraq. This is the same group that was driven out by Sunnis, who then reconstituted itself in Syria when that became an unstable and ungoverned space. So it is possible, but it\u2019s going to take some time.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Marco Rubio insists we can defeat ISIS because we've already defeated ISIS.
