( Matthew Jonas, Times-Call )\n\nCadet Thyfault\n\nThe man accused of fatally striking a Colorado State Patrol cadet with his vehicle Saturday told police that the crash was not his fault due to his vehicle malfunctioning, according to an arrest affidavit from the Longmont Police Department.\n\nChristopher Lee Gebers, 27, was arrested Saturday after leading police on a high-speed chase down Colorado 66 that ended in the death of 21-year-old State Patrol Cadet Taylor Thyfault.\n\nClinton Rushing, a 37-year-old trooper, was also struck and critically injured.\n\nThe incident happened when Thyfault and Rushing were assisting with a separate crash around 7:45 a.m. near Colorado 66 near County Line Road, just northeast of Longmont.\n\nTrooper Rushing\n\nThen, shortly after 8 a.m., a Honda, driven by Gebers, sped west along Colorado 66 toward the earlier accident.\n\nRushing was trying to deploy \"stop sticks\" to puncture the Honda's tires while Thyfault was watching out for the accident victims and emergency workers.\n\nThe Honda hit Rushing first and then went into a drift. That's when it hit Thyfault, who was still standing in the road. The Honda landed in a field, facing the opposite direction it had been heading.\n\nGebers was treated and released from Longmont United Hospital and then taken to the Boulder County Jail. He was being held Saturday for investigation of first-degree murder with extreme indifference, attempted first-degree murder with extreme indifference, vehicular assault, vehicular homicide, reckless endangerment, reckless driving, eluding a police officer, driving vehicle while license canceled/denied and illegal use of blue lights, Longmont Police said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to the affidavit, witnesses on scene heard Gebers \"complain it was not his fault because his emergency brake locked up and his accelerator stuck.\"\n\nThe affidavit also said Gebers told this to police.\n\nThe affidavit said that Gebers' criminal history includes 16 entries with an extensive history for drug violations and numerous weapon offenses. His driver's license had been cancelled.\n\nGebers is expected to have a first court appearance at Boulder County Jail at 2 p.m. Tuesday.\n\nElizabeth Hernandez: 303-954-1223, ehernandez@denverpost.com or twitter.com/ehernandez", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.canoncitydailyrecord.com/news/canoncity-local-news/ci_28180890/man-charged-fatally-striking-cadet-blames-car-malfunction", "modificationDate": "2015-05-24T17:33:43-0600", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site36/2015/0523/20150523__20150524_A1_CD24CADET~p2_300.JPG", "sailthru.author": "By Elizabeth Hernandez   The Denver Post", "description": "The man accused of fatally striking a Colorado State Patrol cadet with his vehicle Saturday told police that the crash was not his fault due to his vehicle malfunctioning, according to an arrest affidavit from the Longmont Police Department.", "ag": {"canon": "CanonCityDailyRecord:article:28180890:view"}, "startDate": "2015-05-24T17:07:22-0600", "og": {"url": "http://www.canoncitydailyrecord.com/news/canoncity-local-news/ci_28180890/man-charged-fatally-striking-cadet-blames-car-malfunction", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site36/2015/0523/20150523__20150524_A1_CD24CADET~p2.JPG", "type": "article", "description": "The man accused of fatally striking a Colorado State Patrol cadet with his vehicle Saturday told police that the crash was not his fault due to his vehicle malfunctioning, according to an arrest affidavit from the Longmont Police Department.", "title": "Man charged with fatally striking cadet blames car malfunction"}, "twitter": {"domain": "canoncitydailyrecord.com", "description": "The man accused of fatally striking a Colorado State Patrol cadet with his vehicle Saturday told police that the crash was not his fault due to his vehicle malfunctioning, according to an arrest affidavit from the Longmont Police Department.", "creator": "@ehernandez", "url": "http://www.canoncitydailyrecord.com/news/canoncity-local-news/ci_28180890/man-charged-fatally-striking-cadet-blames-car-malfunction", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site36/2015/0523/20150523__20150524_A1_CD24CADET~p2.JPG", "title": "Man charged with fatally striking cadet blames car malfunction", "site": "@CCDR_news", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-05-24T17:07:22-0600", "sailthru.site": "canoncitydailyrecord.com", "endDate": "2025-05-24T17:07:18-0600", "sailthru.title": "Man charged with fatally striking cadet blames car malfunction", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Canon City News", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "google-site-verification": "oCjqPZ-ii-IZW-fBJ0mmX5dmH5aafePG3FLx_kSYFiA", "byline": "By Elizabeth Hernandez", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site36/2015/0523/20150523__20150524_A1_CD24CADET~p2.JPG", "pubDate": "2015-05-24T17:08:25-0600", "news_keywords": "Education, Education news, Canyon City Colorado Education news, Canyon City Colorado news, Education Canyon City news, Education Colorado news, US Education news, world Education news."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc99cf\"", "article_summary": "Trooper RushingThen, shortly after 8 a.m., a Honda, driven by Gebers, sped west along Colorado 66 toward the earlier accident.\n( Matthew Jonas, Times-Call )Cadet ThyfaultThe man accused of fatally striking a Colorado State Patrol cadet with his vehicle Saturday told police that the crash was not his fault due to his vehicle malfunctioning, according to an arrest affidavit from the Longmont Police Department.\nColorado State Patrol, Weld County sheriff's deputies, Longmont police and Mountain View Fire Rescue personnel work the scene of a fatal crash Saturday near Weld County Road 1 and Colorado 66.\nChristopher Lee Gebers, 27, was arrested Saturday after leading police on a high-speed chase down Colorado 66 that ended in the death of 21-year-old State Patrol Cadet Taylor Thyfault.\nThe incident happened when Thyfault and Rushing were assisting with a separate crash around 7:45 a.m. near Colorado 66 near County Line Road, just northeast of Longmont."}
