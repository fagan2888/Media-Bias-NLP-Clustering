Members of the Kansas Children's Cabinet criticized the leader of their group for excluding them from recent funding recommendations for early childhood programs.

The recommendations come in a document that says they are "from the Kansas Children's Cabinet." But group members said they didn't vote on them.

Amanda Adkins, the group's chairwoman, said Friday she needed to move quickly in order to get the recommendations to lawmakers during the budget process.

Cabinet members didn't express opposition to the recommendations themselves, and in some cases praised them.

The Topeka Capital-Journal reports, however, that Children's Cabinet member Rep. Valdenia Winn called for more conversation and discussion with the group before a recommendation takes place.

The children's cabinet agreed to schedule an additional meeting before its next scheduled meeting on April 22.
