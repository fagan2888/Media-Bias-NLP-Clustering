Burwell. The Sisters, joined by many Protestant groups, have challenged the Affordable Care Act\u2019s mandate on birth control. Even though the Obama administration devised a method by which religious organizations would not have to pay for birth control coverage, the religious groups still had to start the bypass process by filing a letter. This, the Sisters have argued, made them complicit in a practice (birth control) the Catholic Church forbids. This is the first religious liberty case the court has heard since the passing of Antonin Scalia. It may very well end in a 4-4 tie, which would leave intact lower court rulings, all but one of which favored the government against the Sisters.\n\nIf that happens, conservative Christians are likely to think, \u201cOh, how we wish Scalia would have been here for this case.\u201d One problem: he was the author of the most notorious decision regarding religious liberty in the past fifty years. And, irony of ironies, the Sisters are appealing to a law that was passed precisely to overturn Scalia\u2019s infamous decision. Oregon v. Smith (1990) was largely overlooked in all the retrospectives and eulogies for Scalia. In the many obituaries and op-eds I read after his death, not a single one mentioned the case. Yet, this was easily the most significant religious liberty decision of Scalia\u2019s career. And it was also the most reviled.\n\nThe Smith decision is better remembered as the Peyote case. In the 1980s, Alfred Smith and Galen Black, two members of the Native America Church, were fired from their jobs as drug counselors (of all things) for ingesting the hallucinogenic drug peyote. This was a sacramental practice of their religion, something Native Americans had practiced for centuries. Because they had been fired for violating Oregon\u2019s drug laws, Smith and Black were denied unemployment benefits. They sued, claiming the denial of benefits violated their right to the free exercise of religion.\n\nAs the case wound its way through appeals, most religious liberty experts believed Smith and Black would lose at the Supreme Court. At that time, the Court held to a \u201cstrict scrutiny\u201d standard whenever law or government regulatory power curtailed religious practice. Moreover, a state needed to show a \u201ccompelling interest\u201d whenever its otherwise neutral laws infringed on religious free exercise. This compelling interest test, as it was called, had been developed by the Court in the 1960s as a way of interpreting and applying the free exercise clause of the First Amendment. In other words, because religious freedom is not absolute (you can\u2019t engage in human sacrifice, for example), the court developed the test as a way to gauge when it was permissible to restrict religion.\n\nThe common assumption leading up to the Smith decision was that with the \u201cwar on drugs\u201d at its height, Oregon would have little difficulty showing a compelling interest for enforcing its drug laws, even when such enforcement restricted the religious practices of a Native American religious group. Many individuals and groups had used the compelling interest test to argue for a religious exemption to various laws. Only two had ever won. In other words, in the vast majority of such cases, the state could show a compelling interest.\n\nThis time the Court shocked everyone. Scalia and the four justices who signed on to his majority opinion not only ruled in favor of Oregon and against Smith and Black, but also threw out the compelling interest test in its entirety. Making this doubly surprising, the state of Oregon had not even asked the Court to reconsider compelling interest. Rather, the state\u2019s attorneys seemed quite content to simply pass the test\u2014to show convincingly that Oregon had a compelling interest in enforcing its drug laws.\n\nBut Scalia argued that if people, even in theory, could be granted an exemption from an otherwise constitutional law, we were \u201ccourting anarchy.\u201d If people believed a particular law violated their religious practices, he continued, they should lobby their legislature for redress rather than asking the courts to grant an exemption. From the Smith decision forward, states no longer needed to show a compelling interest for restricting religion, but merely that a law or regulatory practice was \u201cgenerally applicable\u201d\u2014that is, not intended specifically to curtail religion.\n\nThere followed a hue and cry that united groups across the political and theological spectrum. The Christian Right as well as the secular left joined together in denouncing the decision. The Southern Baptist Convention joined the ACLU, as did virtually every church-state lobby group whether evangelical, liberal Protestant, Catholic, Jewish, or secularist. There was a consensus that the Court had gutted the First Amendment\u2019s free exercise clause, placing religious liberty at the whim of majorities in legislatures.\n\nCongress responded to the uproar by crafting and enacting a law designed specifically to overturn the Supreme Court\u2019s decision. The Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) passed with a unanimous voice vote in the House and only 3 nay votes in the Senate. President Bill Clinton signed it into law in 1993.\n\nRFRA reinstated the compelling interest test for federal, state, and local governments. Not a body to take a congressional smack down lightly, the Supreme Court responded in Boerne (TX) v. Flores (1997) by striking down the state and local provisions of RFRA but leaving intact the law\u2019s application to the federal government. Many states responded to the Boerne decision by passing their own \u201cmini-RFRA\u201d laws, as they were called.\n\nAnd all this brings us back to last week\u2019s case Little Sisters of the Poor v. Burwell. The basis of the Sisters\u2019 claim is the compelling interest test embedded in RFRA. If Scalia were alive he likely would side with the Sisters. Not because he was Catholic, but because he believed in deference to legislatures. Oddly, the law to which he would have deferred was passed precisely to overturn a decision he wrote.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Anxious Bench", "description": "The Relevance of Religious History for Today", "title": "Scalia\u2019s Worst Decision?", "url": "http://www.patheos.com/blogs/anxiousbench/2016/03/scalias-worst-decision/", "image": "http://media.patheos.com/Images/EVPT/EVPT_AnxiousBench_bio.jpg", "type": "article"}, "com.silverpop.brandeddomains": "www.pages04.net,patheos.mkt5005.com,www.patheos.com", "robots": "noodp,noydir"}, "article_summary": "And, irony of ironies, the Sisters are appealing to a law that was passed precisely to overturn Scalia\u2019s infamous decision.\nThe Smith decision is better remembered as the Peyote case.\nYet, this was easily the most significant religious liberty decision of Scalia\u2019s career.\nRFRA reinstated the compelling interest test for federal, state, and local governments.\nMany individuals and groups had used the compelling interest test to argue for a religious exemption to various laws."}
