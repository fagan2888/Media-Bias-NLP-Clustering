News reported that the \u201cHigh School Musical\u201d star, who previously dated his co-star Vanessa Hudgens, was spotted posing for pictures with fans as he went on his relaxing trip.\n\n\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s healthy, happy and not drinking,\u201d said a source. \u201cHe\u2019s taking time to focus on working.\u201d\n\n\n\nSources explained that the \u201cNeighbors\u201d actor would party for days as his serious drug problem grew after being introduced to cocaine and Molly.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe partying got out of hand. He cared so much about his career,\u201d said a source. \u201cHe went through a lot of pills even though it was clear he was entering a danger zone.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe actor reportedly missed multiple days of shooting Seth Rogen\u2019s film, \u201cNeighbors,\u201d in April due to his struggle with cocaine.\n\n\n\nEfron finally decided to clean up his act after doing cocaine for more than two years and completed his second stint in a treatment facility about five months ago.\n\n\n\nEfron appeared at the Toronto International Film Festival to promote his new drama, \u201cParkland,\u201d about John F. Kennedy\u2019s assassination and said he feel like his career is moving in a new direction.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really a surreal experience for me. It feels very mature and really interesting. It\u2019s a different kind of filmmaking and I feel blessed to have been a part of it,\u201d said Efron to USA Today.\n\n\n\nEfron has never been an actor who creates too much attention or speaks extensively about his personal life and lets his work do the talking. Hopefully his fans will get to see Efron continue to live his sober and drug free life as he continues to focus on exciting new projects.\n\n\n\nSIGN UP TO RECEIVE THE LATEST NEWS FROM FASHION&STYLE\n\n\u00a9 2015 Fashion & Style.com All rights reserved.
