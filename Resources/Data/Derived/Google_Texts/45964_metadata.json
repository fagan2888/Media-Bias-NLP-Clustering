But the VC community is pushing back against the idea that they are driving valuations up by showering small firms with cash.\n\nAccording to the MoneyTree report, issued by PricewaterhouseCoopers and the National Venture Capital Association, venture capitalists invested $13.0 billion during the second quarter of 2014, a 34 percent increase in dollar terms over the first quarter. It also represented a 13 percent increase in the number of deals.\n\nRelated: Big Businesses Look to Knock Out Disruptive Upstarts\n\nThe headline deal was a $1.2 billion financing package for ride-sharing service Uber Technologies. Backed by the likes of BlackRock Private Equity Partners, Fidelity Investments and Summit Partners, it was by far the largest deal of the quarter and the biggest deal ever in the two decade history of the MoneyTree report.\n\nOther firms, including Uber competitor LYFT Inc.; Pure Storage, a computer memory firm; and Intarcia Therapeutics, all scored deals worth $200 million or more.\n\nOne reason the numbers are so astronomical is that money is being poured into a handful of highly valued pre-IPO firms. These top firms are waiting longer and longer to go public. \u201cThere is more concentration in some of these largest companies,\u201d said Jeff Crowe, managing partner at Norwest Venture Partners, a multi-stage venture capital and growth equity investment firm. They get a lot of attention in private investing now, but they would have been public 10 years ago. They are that big already.\u201d\n\nCrowe recognizes that the level of investments and valuations are high. \u201cBut you are seeing these big opportunities to transform industries, and those only come along every 10 to 15 years. That\u2019s what people are excited about right now.\u201d\n\nRelated: Investors Will Be Watching Techs, Banks and Yellen\n\nHowever, according to, Crowe, if you took away the top 10 deals, the second quarter of 2012 would look less like a feeding frenzy aimed at a few big names and more like a normal period in which VCs spread out a lot of smaller investments in promising early-stage firms.\n\n\u201cYes, the spotlight is on these really big companies that got the large financing. But [entrepreneurs] too can get there,\u201d said John Taylor, head of research for the NVCA. \u201cThe venture industry is still very much open for business in terms of taking in new companies into their portfolios.\u201d\n\nFriday\u2019s MoneyTree report bears him out. The second-quarter data shows that seed stage investments increased by 46 percent in dollar terms, with $189 million invested into 55 deals, and early stage investments increased by 17 percent, with $3.8 billion going into 522 deals. In addition, companies receiving VC money for the very first time increased 48 percent to $1.9 billion, making up 14 percent of all dollars in the second quarter.\n\n\u201c[VC]s' attention really is focused on the next generation of companies, bringing them in and bringing them along,\u201d said NVCA's Taylor. \u201cYou can start a lot of these companies on a shoestring.\u201d\n\nRelated: Millennials Embrace Alternative Medicine, a $32 Billion Business\n\nEspecially software firms, apparently. In the second quarter, the software industry led the funding pack by a significant amount, with $6.1 billion invested, a 50 percent rise from the first three months of 2014. The industry also had 454 deals in the most recent quarter, the most of any industry.\n\n\u201cSoftware is very investible,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cThe software industry is capital-efficient and well-regarded by the industry. We will continue to see that strengthened.\u201d\n\nOther sectors that did well include biotech, with $1.8 billion invested in 122 deals, and the Media & Entertainment industry, with $1.0 billion going into 124 deals.\n\nIn all, Crowe said, the time is ripe for starting a company. \u201cYou can create very powerful products and applications now with under a million dollars,\u201d he said. And the VC community is open for business.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "A report released Friday shows venture capitalists invested $13.0 billion during the second quarter of 2014.
