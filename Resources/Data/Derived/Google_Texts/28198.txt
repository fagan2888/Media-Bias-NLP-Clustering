Or: Babs blabs about Hobby Lobby.

Noah Rothman, Mediaite:

In an appearance on MSNBC on Tuesday ahead of oral arguments before the Supreme Court in a case brought by the retailer Hobby Lobby against the government’s directive in the Affordable Care Act to mandate covering certain forms of birth control, Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-CA) said that the firm was being hypocritical by not objecting to insurance packages that also cover Viagra.

So, Barbara Boxer is saying that sex is only for procreation. That seems like a rather conservative, ahem, position to take, doesn’t it?

I don’t know if insurance companies should or shouldn’t cover Viagra. That decision is best made between insurers and the insured. As is coverage of certain forms of birth control. How is it hypocritical to agree upon one but not the other? Just because they both involve erections?

Devout Christians follow Genesis 1:28, “Be fruitful and multiply.” Birth control contravenes that. Viagra doesn’t. And?

I submit to you, dear reader, that Barbara Boxer is a dunce.

That said, a note to all you teabaggers out there who are saying, “The best form of birth control is looking at Barbara Boxer”: I won’t abide that sort of ugly sexism. Shame on you.

Update: Courtesy of Twitchy, here’s Boxer saying these stupid things in real life.

Even the MSNBC anchor pushed back on this nonsensical point. That’s when you know it’s time to sit down, Babs.
