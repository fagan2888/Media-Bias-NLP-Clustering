As WMFE\u2019s Alicia Mandigo reports, the site is up, but it\u2019s not running.\n\nThe Spanish-language version of HealthCare.gov, CuidadoDeSalud.gov, was supposed to be up and running this past Monday, but instead, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services is directing users to its Spanish call center.\n\nAltamonte Springs resident Miriam Lopez said she heard it\u2019s better to apply online, so she\u2019s been reluctant to enroll by phone.\n\n\u201cSo maybe I might, I\u2019m waiting, if I can\u2019t apply online, because they say it\u2019s going to be soon, so I might call, or I might go to the places that they have for help,\u201d Lopez said.\n\nLopez said when she clicked through the website she found a list of local places she could go to for face to face Spanish language help.\n\nHHS Press Secretary Fabien Levy told WMFE via email that market research shows Latinos prefer personalized assistance over enrolling online, and that 70 percent of Latinos will apply in English.\n\nCuidadoDeSalud.gov is an important component in the Affordable Care Act. An estimated 10 million Latinos are eligible for health insurance, and their enrollment is considered critical to the Affordable Care Act\u2019s overall success.", "article_metadata": {"category": "HNF Stories", "description": "Some Florida Latinos are waiting on the Affordable Care Act\u2019s Spanish language website to become available so they can sign up for coverage.
