We're planning two live shows: one in Austin, Texas, on April 23, and a special Gabfest Roulette with all the Slate podcasts on May 28 in New York. Mark your calendar!

On this week’s Slate Political Gabfest, John Dickerson, David Plotz, and Bloomberg View columnist Megan McArdle discuss whether Obama should have been more aggressive in Ukraine and Syria, how Obamacare enrollment is shaping up, and McArdle’s new book about why failure is the key to success.

Here are some of the links and references mentioned during this week’s show:

John chatters about the first hot air balloon flight, which ended with peasants attacking the balloon with pitchforks.

Megan chatters about Airbnb’s funding talks—it’s reportedly seeking a valuation of $10 billion, which is more than the combined valuation of most major hotel companies.

David chatters about Kate Ascher’s book about transportation infrastructure, The Way to Go, which Slate excerpted.

This week's credits were in the style of John Galt.
