I\u2019m not a professional politician, and I think professional politicians are a relatively modern invention \u2014 and not a particularly good one.\u201d\n\nShe added:\n\nI think I\u2019d bring a different perspective and a different voice. I\u2019ll be exploring over these next couple months: Can we build the right support? Can we build the right financial resources? Can we build the right team?\n\nEarlier, Fiorina, 60, spoke about the nature of leadership during her keynote address at an event at The Heritage Foundation organized in conjunction with Thursday\u2019s 42nd annual March for Life.\n\n\u201cI think professional politicians are a relatively modern invention\u2013and not a particularly good one,\u201d @CarlyFiorina says.\n\nCalled \u201cWelcoming Every Life,\u201d the speech and panel discussion afterward focused on rescuing more unborn children with severe disabilities from abortion. Heritage and National Review Institute co-sponsored the program, which also featured pro-life activists Mark Bradford, Dan LaHood and Charmaine Yoest.\n\n>>> Commentary: Women Overwhelmingly Support 20-Week Abortion Ban\n\nFiorina spoke about how different her life would have been had her own husband\u2019s mother heeded advice not to give birth to him. She also recalled how, at 23 and in Washington, D.C., she helped a good friend get an abortion.\n\n\u201cThe hypocrisy of liberal positions is shocking to me,\u201d Fiorina said, adding:\n\nI have lived for more than a decade in the state of California and there, lives and livelihoods have been routinely destroyed because of the extreme lengths that liberals have gone to protect the lives of fish, of frogs and indeed, yes, even of flies. Liberals may not know when life begins, but surely even they regard human life is worth more than a fly\u2019s?\n\n>>> Watch Fiorina\u2019s Speech and the Panel Discussion\n\nFiorina, CEO of Hewlett-Packard Co. from 1999 to 2005, is also known to many Americans for mounting a vigorous challenge in 2010 for Democrat Barbara Boxer\u2019s U.S. Senate seat representing California. She lost by 10 points.\n\nSince Thanksgiving, Fiorina \u2014 now a Virginia resident \u2014 has become increasingly comfortable talking about a White House bid, hiring related staff while ruling out another run for Senate in California.\n\nShe currently is chairman of the nonprofit Good360, which steers corporate surplus to charities, and also heads UnlockingPotential, a political action committee designed to engage women in public life in new ways.\n\nA breast cancer survivor, she is one of only a few women mentioned among potential GOP hopefuls to go up against the supposed Democratic front-runner, Hillary Rodham Clinton, in the 2016 presidential race.\n\nFiorina\u2019s speech dwelled on the potential and preciousness of every human life \u2013 and that gave her a way to talk about leadership too.\n\n\u201cEvery human life has potential and every human life is precious.\u201d-@CarlyFiorina @Heritage #marchforlife pic.twitter.com/czIJ8E9Qjc \u2014 Ken McIntyre (@KenMac55) January 20, 2015\n\n\u201cLeadership has nothing to do with position or title or power,\u201d Fiorina said, and its \u201chighest calling\u201d is to \u201cunlock the potential in others.\u201d She said:\n\nI have learned over the course of my life that every person has potential, that everyone has God-given gifts. And in truth, most people have far more potential than they realize. I\u2019ve also learned something about leadership. Leadership differs fundamentally from management. Management is the production of acceptable results within known constraints and conditions, whereas leadership is to change those constraints and conditions. Leadership is the act of changing the order of things. And therefore the highest calling of leadership is to unlock potential in others.\n\nAfter her speech, Fiorina told The Daily Signal that she is hopeful public perspective will shift more toward a pro-life perspective and discomfort with late-term abortions. She said science and technology show that unborn babies dream and feel pain at five months, and surgeons can save the lives of unborn babies under 19 weeks.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe need to continue to articulate our principles in human terms, in scientific terms, in compassionate terms,\u201d Fiorina said in the interview. \u201c[W]e\u2019re moving in the right direction, and I think the polls would support that.\u201d\n\nDisgusting. Pro-abortion group @emilyslist called @joniernst \u201cwindow dressing.\u201d The left\u2019s \u201cwar on women\u201d continues. #tcot #SOTU \u2014 Carly Fiorina (@CarlyFiorina) January 21, 2015\n\nShe is hopeful especially because of younger Americans.\n\n\u201cYoung people are un-amazed by what technology can do,\u201d she told The Daily Signal. \u201cI think they\u2019re attuned to the miracle of science and technology and \u2026 are open-minded about people who are different [because of prenatal conditions] than they are.\u201d\n\nYoung adults also are skeptical about \u201cthe pro-abortion lobby,\u201d she said, because its political message is \u201cunbelievably strident and extreme\u201d in advocating a right to abortion at any time during a pregnancy, for whatever reason.\n\n\u201cWe gather here because we know that the life we save may make all the difference in the lives of others,\u201d @CarlyFiorina says.\n\nShe concluded her speech by drawing a comparatively reasonable picture of pro-life activists who will descend Thursday on Washington for the March for Life:\n\nWe gather here in Washington for the 42nd year not because we are stupid or because we are extreme or because we are uncaring. We gather here because we know that women and their unborn children deserve our respect, they deserve our empathy and they deserve our support. We gather here because we know that the life we save may make all the difference in the lives of others. We gather here because we know that no one of us is any better than any other one of us. We gather here because we know that every human life has potential and every human life is precious.\n\nThis report has been modified to specify that Fiorina is a resident of Virginia.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Conservative entrepreneur and former business executive Carly Fiorina said today she is taking a close look at joining the Republican race for president.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Conservative entrepreneur and former business executive Carly Fiorina said today she is taking a close look at joining the Republican race for president.", "title": "Will Fiorina Run for President After Marching for Life?", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/zumaamericaseleven312083.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-01-27T16:20:54+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1upewUC"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Conservative entrepreneur and former business executive Carly Fiorina said today she is taking a close look at joining the Republican race for president.", "title": "Will Fiorina Run for President After Marching for Life?", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/zumaamericaseleven312083.jpg"}, "creator": "@KenMac55", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "2016,politics,Protecting Life", "published_time": "2015-01-20T17:53:22+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-27T16:20:54+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Carly Fiorina, Carly Fiorina March for Life, Carly Fiorina pro-life, Carly Fiorina Republican presidential candidates, presidential race 2016"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdbc1\"", "article_summary": "We gather here because we know that every human life has potential and every human life is precious.\nLiberals may not know when life begins, but surely even they regard human life is worth more than a fly\u2019s?\nAfter her speech, Fiorina told The Daily Signal that she is hopeful public perspective will shift more toward a pro-life perspective and discomfort with late-term abortions.\nCalled \u201cWelcoming Every Life,\u201d the speech and panel discussion afterward focused on rescuing more unborn children with severe disabilities from abortion.\nFiorina\u2019s speech dwelled on the potential and preciousness of every human life \u2013 and that gave her a way to talk about leadership too."}
