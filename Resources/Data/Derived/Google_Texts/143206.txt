Booz Allen Hamilton said Monday it had bought the Baltimore-based health care unit of Genova Technologies, which provides services to the federal agency overseeing implementation of the Affordable Care Act.

Terms of the deal were not disclosed, and Iowa-based Genova will retain its defense and commercial businesses.

McLean, Va.-based-Booz Allen Hamilton, a leading management consulting and technology company, said the Genova unit and its staff of 40 will supplement work the company already performs for federal health care agencies. Genova provides information technology services for the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.

This year, Booz Allen also was awarded a contract under that agency to design, implement and evaluate research, payment and service delivery systems aimed at reducing heath costs while maintaining or improving quality of care.
