Obamacare is not going away. We\u2019re still talking about life and death, but the fight will be around healthcare in general, with rising prescription drug costs as evidence of what\u2019s wrong.\"Hillary Clinton has said she supports \"a greater role for the government in driving down drug prices\" but has not offered any specifics.Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, a socialist who has long been a proponent of a single-payer healthcare system \u2014 in which the government funds healthcare for all Americans \u2014 has said he would like to see Medicare become an \"active negotiator\" in price-setting for prescription drugs, according to Politico.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "prescription, drugs, costs, obamacare, control, price setting", "pubdate": "2015-08-20T12:12:29", "og": {"site_name": "Newsmax", "description": "Americans across the political spectrum overwhelmingly agree that skyrocketing prescription drug costs - not repealing Obamacare - should be the top healthcare priority for Congress and the president, Politico reports, citing a Kaiser Family Foundation study.", "title": "Report: Americans More Worried About Drug Costs Than Obamacare", "url": "http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/prescription-drugs-costs-obamacare/2015/08/20/id/671023/", "type": "article", "image": "http://www.newsmax.com/CMSPages/GetFile.aspx?guid=23ce885c-99dd-4143-abbb-dd40e809b058&SiteName=Newsmax", "page_id": 85452072376}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/prescription-drugs-costs-obamacare/2015/08/20/id/671023/", "title": "Report: Americans More Worried About Drug Costs Than Obamacare", "description": "Americans across the political spectrum overwhelmingly agree that skyrocketing prescription drug costs - not repealing Obamacare - should be the top healthcare priority for Congress and the president, Politico reports, citing a Kaiser Family Foundation study.", "site": "Newsmax"}, "fb": {"admins": 100002083767056, "app_id": 323020797885219}, "msvalidate.01": "FAF1322EC761685A5DD9344A1C19E82A", "epoch": 1440072749, "google-site-verification": "Jt2HUKgzJJw9VwIQJv31ETytuvNNm5ypTWN6j0nYvHM", "keywords": "prescription, drugs, costs, obamacare, control, price setting", "article": {"section": "Newsfront", "published_time": "2015-08-20T12:12:29"}, "original-source": "http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/prescription-drugs-costs-obamacare/2015/08/20/id/671023/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "description": "Americans across the political spectrum overwhelmingly agree that skyrocketing prescription drug costs - not repealing Obamacare - should be the top healthcare priority for Congress and the president, Politico reports, citing a Kaiser Family Foundation study."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda92c\"", "article_summary": "\"But noted conservative pollster David Merritt suggests prescription drug costs will be more of a corollary issue.\nWe\u2019re still talking about life and death, but the fight will be around healthcare in general, with rising prescription drug costs as evidence of what\u2019s wrong.\n\"Specific to drug costs, I think it will be secondary,\" he said.\n\"More than 20 percent of Americans had taken three or more prescriptions in the last 30 days, the CDC said.\n\"Other studies have put the number as high as 70 percent,\" according to the Journal."}
