Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) wants his colleagues to sign off on a museum that would focus on the role of immigrants in American history.

The Hawaii Democrat has introduced a resolution voicing support for establishing a commission to study the creation of a National Museum of the American People.

ADVERTISEMENT "The story of America is a story about immigration," Schatz said in a statement on Monday. "Building the National Museum of the American People would help tell the story of every immigrant of every ethnic group and would be a great way to celebrate the patriotism, contributions, and achievements of all Americans.‚Äù

According to the resolution, no federal funding would be used to build, design or furnish the museum. Non-taxpayer dollars would also be used to help pay for the commission, which wouldn't get its funding until President Obama signed an executive order to create the group.

Outside organizations have been trying for years to get a museum created. The Coalition for the National Museum of the American People sent a letter to Obama earlier this month calling on him to establish the commission.

"The National Museum of the American People will showcase how, when, why and from where we arrived in this land, our movements across the plains and mountains of the country, what each group encountered and how each helped to transform our nation," they wrote in the letter.
