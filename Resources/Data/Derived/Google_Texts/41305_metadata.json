Same with Heter. Playing last year was huge for him. Now he\u2019s in there this year and he\u2019s working on refining things, not battling for a starting job. He\u2019s a starter and he\u2019s looking to take that next step in the echelon of the conference.\u201dMorrill, of Lebanon, is in his customary home at left guard.The graduation of left tackle Rob Bowman and center Mike Coccia, who is in camp with the Philadelphia Eagles, led to position swaps on the line. Heter has moved from right tackle to left tackle and McNeely moved over a spot from right guard to center.Junior Andrew Lauderdale, 6-foot-7 and 275 pounds, had already transitioned over from tight end and is projected to be the starter at right tackle. He is a Trinity of Manchester grad.\u201cLauderdale is doing a good job,\u201d Miller said. \u201cHe\u2019s been on such a steep climb since coming over from tight end. He just keeps getting better ... He\u2019s already an aggressive kid. I don\u2019t ever have to tell him to hit somebody. He\u2019s always doing that. It\u2019s refining pass pro (protection) and stuff like that that takes a little more finesse. That\u2019s probably the hardest transition to go from tight end to O-line, the pass pro part of it. But every day he gets better.\u201dSenior George Kallas and junior Curtis Nealer have been battling for the starting job at right guard. Kallas started three games and Nealer a couple last season.McNeely is not new to the center spot. He started the last eight games of his redshirt freshman season there after Coccia\u2019s 2013 season ended with shoulder surgery. He was back at guard last season.\u201cIt\u2019s great that he played center two years ago,\u201d Miller said. \u201cNow we move him back to center and there\u2019s no learning curve. He\u2019s already made calls. He\u2019s already done this. It\u2019s a great thing for me as coach to have someone to lean on. He\u2019s a good player.\u201dMorrill calls McNeely the leader of the group.\u201cTad\u2019s had the most experience and has played a lot of football,\u201d Morrill said. \u201cHe knows what he\u2019s doing. For me, I look up to Tad and I think he\u2019s the leader of the offensive line.\u201dMcNeely and Morrill have their similarities and their differences.\u201cTad has exceptional flexibility,\u201d Miller said. \u201cHe\u2019s also very intelligent. He and Morrill both are intelligent guys and that helps early. When you can figure out the playbook early, you can focus on your technique. When you\u2019re younger and you\u2019re worried about which way you\u2019re going, you\u2019re not always focusing on your technique.\u201dMorrill\u2019s strength at the start was his, well, strength.\u201cMorrill, we just call him a big old bear,\u201d Miller said. \u201cHe\u2019s a strong human being. He looks like a refrigerator, or ice chest. He\u2019s a strong kid. He\u2019s got good flexibility. Tad\u2019s probably a little more athletic and Morrill\u2019s probably a little bit stronger. Where Tad\u2019s gotten little stronger the last couple of years, Morrill\u2019s gotten a little more flexible, which has made him a better player. He\u2019s better at pass protection because of that. You had two different guys early on. One was really strong. One was super athletic and flexible and now they\u2019ve both kind of meshed together over the last couple of years and it\u2019s been good for us.\u201dMiller looks to McNeely, Morrill and Heter, along with Kallas and Nealer, to help bring the younger guys \u2014 players such as Will McInerny, Jake Kennedy, Dayne Herron and Mike Zaloga \u2014 along.\u201cThose are the kids that in a couple of years will be really, really good players for us,\u201d Miller said. \u201cI think we\u2019ve got a good mix right now. The young kids are doing some things. They\u2019re the ones who are not only going to be critical to our depth, but critical to our future as well.\u201dThe future is now, too, with the Wildcats opening the season at San Jose State, an FBS opponent, on Thursday, Sept. 3 at 10 p.m. Eastern time.Last year\u2019s offensive line helped the Wildcats boost their output by more than five points a game from the season before and allowed opponents to sack UNH quarterbacks just 27 times in 14 games, the third best number in the Colonial Athletic Association. The unit did its share in helping UNH to a 12-2 record, an 11th straight appearance in the FCS tournament and second consecutive trip to the semifinals.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A little position-shuffling among the big guys up front has a couple of players in new-for-this-year spots for the University of New Hampshire football team: The bottom line is three of the five starters from a year ago are back to lead the offensive line.", "title": "College Football: All lined up on offense at UNH | New Hampshire", "og": {"site_name": "UnionLeader.com", "description": "A little position-shuffling among the big guys up front has a couple of players in new-for-this-year spots for the University of New Hampshire football team: The bottom line is three of the five starters from a year ago are back to lead the offensive line.", "title": "College Football: All lined up on offense at UNH | New Hampshire", "url": "http://www.unionleader.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20150824/SPORTS22/150829712/1038&template=mobileart", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.unionleader.com/storyimage/UL/20150824/SPORTS22/150829712/AR/0/AR-150829712.jpg?q=70?ExactW=600&ExactH=314&imageversion=MainHighlight&q=80", "height": 314}, "type": "article"}, "section": "College Sports", "robots": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "ROBOTS": "NOARCHIVE", "keywords": "College, Durham,", "fb": {"app_id": 665237656918292}, "date": "2015-08-24 00:00:00", "twitter": {"description": "A little position-shuffling among the big guys up front has a couple of players in new-for-this-year spots for the University of New Hampshire football team: The bottom line is three of the five starters from a year ago are back to lead the offensive line.", "title": "College Football: All lined up on offense at UNH | New Hampshire", "url": "http://www.unionleader.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20150824/SPORTS22/150829712/1038&template=mobileart", "image": "/storyimage/UL/20150824/SPORTS22/150829712/AR/0/AR-150829712.jpg?q=70", "site": "@UnionLeader", "card": "summary$t"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc87b\"", "article_summary": "He\u2019s a good player.\u201dMorrill calls McNeely the leader of the group.\u201cTad\u2019s had the most experience and has played a lot of football,\u201d Morrill said.\nNow he\u2019s in there this year and he\u2019s working on refining things, not battling for a starting job.\nHe is a Trinity of Manchester grad.\u201cLauderdale is doing a good job,\u201d Miller said.\nHe started the last eight games of his redshirt freshman season there after Coccia\u2019s 2013 season ended with shoulder surgery.\nKallas started three games and Nealer a couple last season.McNeely is not new to the center spot."}
