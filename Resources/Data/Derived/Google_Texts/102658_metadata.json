In celebration of the Silver State\u2019s anniversary, Fact Checker looks at three.\n\nHoover Dam deaths\n\nDuring construction of the Hoover Dam in Southern Nevada, some workers fell into the concrete as it was poured but it was too difficult to pull them out and the concrete just kept being poured \u2014 or so some claim.\n\nThe federal Bureau of Reclamation dispels this myth on its website by pointing out that the concrete wasn\u2019t poured all at once but in small sections that couldn\u2019t have buried a worker. Excerpt:\n\n\u201cThe dam was built in interlocking blocks. Each block was five feet high. The smallest blocks were about 25 feet by 25 feet square, and the largest blocks were about 25 feet by 60 feet. Concrete was delivered to each block in buckets, eight cubic yards at a time. After each bucket was delivered, five or six men called \u2018puddlers\u2019 would stamp and vibrate the concrete into place, packing it down to ensure there were no air pockets in it. Each time a bucket was emptied, the level of concrete would raise from two inches up to six inches, depending on the size of the block. With only a slight increase in the level at any one time, and the presence of several men watching the placement, it would have been virtually impossible for anyone to be buried in the concrete. So, there are no bodies buried in Hoover Dam.\u201d\n\nSome consider J.G. Tierney the Hoover Dam\u2019s first death when, in 1922, he was doing a geological survey of the area and fell off a barge and drowned. His son, Patrick, was the last to die \u2014 13 years to the day after his dad\u2019s death \u2014 when he fell off the dam\u2019s intake tower.\n\nOne claim that\u2019s far less certain regarding the dam\u2019s construction is the large number of workers classified as dying of \u201cnatural causes,\u201d including 42 from pneumonia. According to Michael Hiltzik\u2019s 2010 book \u201cColossus: Hoover Dam and the Making of the American Century\u201d:\n\n\u201cAlthough pneumonia was by no means an uncommon medical complaint in Depression America, the concentration of so many cases among the tunnel workers strongly suggests that pneumonia, and to a lesser extent coronary problems, were proxies for gas poisoning. This was the universal assumption among Boulder City residents. \u2018If you said they died of gasses in the tunnels, they were obligated to compensate you, to compensate the family,\u2019 recalled the wife of one tunnel inspector. \u2018So they\u2019d say just \u201cpneumonia,\u201d and they\u2019d get by with that. We never felt that was fair.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe Civil War\n\nIt\u2019s been claimed that the 1859 discovery of gold and silver in the Comstock Lode prompted Nevada to be admitted as a state in order to finance Union forces during the Civil War.\n\nHistorian Guy Rocha calls this \u201cperhaps our state\u2019s No. 1 legend\u201d and says in an article on the topic, \u201cAnyone who has attended Nevada\u2019s schools has heard the story from a teacher or read it in a textbook. It\u2019s a wonderful tale, but nothing could be farther from the truth.\u201d\n\nThe confusion probably arises from a combination of three things:\n\n* The state\u2019s Battle Born slogan comes from the fact that it was admitted to the Union during the Civil War.\n\n* A 1962 episode of the TV show \u201cBonanza\u201d \u2014 called \u201cThe War Comes to Washoe\u201d \u2014 showed a constitutional convention in Carson City over whether Nevada would leave the Union and join the Confederacy as a state. The debate was actually over whether to remain a territory or to become a state.\n\n* And probably most importantly, Nevada\u2019s creation as a territory on March 2, 1861 was indeed prompted by a desire to have the state\u2019s mineral riches help the Union and not the Confederacy.\n\nReno & 501 jeans\n\nWho do you think invented the popular style of jeans with riveted pockets, such as Levi\u2019s 501 jeans?\n\nYou\u2019re probably wise enough to know that\u2019s a loaded question and it isn\u2019t the obvious answer of Levi Strauss. But you may not realize that riveted jeans were invented right here in Reno.\n\nThe story does indeed tangentially include a Bavarian Jew named Loeb Strauss, known as Levi, who emigrated to New York at age 18 in 1847. He eventually established a dry goods store in San Francisco with his two older brothers and sister Fanny.\n\nThe Jewish Virtual Library describes what happened next this way: \u201cStrauss\u2019s big break came in 1872, when he was approached by Jacob Davis, a Nevada tailor who had developed a new process for securing the seams of denim pants \u2014 which were already popular with miners, ranchers and farmers \u2014 by riveting them at the pockets and the base of the button fly. Davis could not afford the $81 needed to apply for a patent for his riveting process, so he asked Strauss if he would pay the fee and share the patent. Strauss brought Davis to San Francisco to oversee the pant manufacturing. The riveted jean quickly developed a reputation for durability and quality, and Levi Strauss and Company soon employed several hundred sewing workers.\u201d\n\nDavis was actually a German Jew whose original last name was Youphes. After coming to the United States in 1854, he opened a tailor shop in 1869 on Virginia Street in Reno.\n\nIn 1871, a woman came to Davis and asked him to make a sturdy pair of pants for her plus-sized husband. Davis testified in a patent infringement case a few years later:\n\n\u201cSo when the pants were done \u2014 the rivets were lying on the table \u2014 the thought struck me to fasten the pockets with rivets. I had never thought of it before.\u201d\n\nSoon he was deluged with orders and realized he needed to get the process patented before somebody stole his idea. That\u2019s when he contacted Strauss, who had been supplying the fabric for Davis\u2019 pants.\n\n(Tangent: Davis\u2019 grandson Ben started the Ben Davis Clothing Co. It\u2019s been based in San Francisco since 1935 and is a favorite among such rappers as Dr. Dre, Ice Cube and the Beastie Boys. At bendavis.com, you can read the text of the letter that Jacob Davis sent to Strauss asking for help to cover the cost of the riveting patent. (It says $68, not $81 as mentioned above.))\n\nRocha concludes in an entry in \u201cThe Mythical West: An Encyclopedia of Legend, Lore and Popular Culture\u201d:\n\n\u201cThe next time you look at your Levi 501 jeans, think of Jacob Davis and Reno, Nevada, where it all began in 1871.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Reno Nevada News - rgj.com is the home page of Reno Nevada with in depth and updated Reno local news.
