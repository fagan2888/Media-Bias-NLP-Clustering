It's just the second week of the new system and it's still in BETA, but this morning the bakery assured us there were \"very few glitches\" last week and they expected smooth sailing. It seems they have underestimated the power of champagne and chocolate.\n\n\n\nLIES\n\nIt appears that pastry-seekers were given false hope by the bakery's website, which dangled imaginary Cronuts that, in fact, had already been sold. People, naturally, are pissed:\n\nTHE CRONUT PREORDER WEBSITE ISN'T WORKING I JUST WANT A CHOCOLATE CHAMPAGNE AND ORANGE ZEST CRONUT \u2014 Weston G (@wonderfulweston) November 25, 2013\n\nSCREW the cronut preorder website--which is less functional than the Obamacare website-- and my friends in SF that I'm doing this for. \u2014 Michelle FlorCruz (@mflorcruz) November 25, 2013\n\nWOW CRONUT WEBSITE CAN U WERK NOW \u2014 allie marotta (@alliemarotta) November 25, 2013\n\nI've had more luck getting an #ultra early bird ticket than preordering a #cronut #nycproblems \u2014 Daniela Schechter (@D_Schec) November 25, 2013\n\nAll I want for Christmas is for my cronut order to go through \ud83d\ude14\ud83d\ude14\ud83d\ude14 @DominiqueAnsel \u2014 Ashley (@AshleyDreece) November 25, 2013\n\nDay ruined. Never gunna get a cronut. Currently crying. Bye. \u2014 Ashley (@AshleyDreece) November 25, 2013\n\nThe online order form for @DominiqueAnsel's #cronut isn't user friendly at all. Says they are available when they aren't.. \u2014 Masha D. Murakhovsky (@MashaDaniellePR) November 25, 2013\n\nThe cronut preorder site is really terrible. It keeps crashing & says they are available when they really aren't @DominiqueAnsel \u2014 Steph B-More (@StephBMore) November 25, 2013\n\nAngry folks have begun a comment thread on Facebook to express their outrage, as well. \"Now this is what I call the hunger games,\" joked one user; \"I think there is more chance of getting front row seats to a royal wedding then getting crounuts on pre order,\" quipped another.\n\nFor his part, Ansel urges peace in a time of madness:\n\nEveryone stay calm. It's our second week in beta for http://t.co/1xQm417Yx2. Give it a sec...it'll load (just high traffic that's all). :) \u2014 Dominique Ansel (@DominiqueAnsel) November 25, 2013\n\nA rep for the bakery blames the system crashes and false Cronut hopes their current server, which they plan to replace in advance of next week's preorder rush, as well as Paypal. The rep assures us it \"will get better! We promise! All technology needs time to test.\"\n\nTest our patience, that is!", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Gothamist", "description": "WHY GOD?", "title": "Online Cronut Preorder System Goes Full Obamacare", "url": "http://gothamist.com/2013/11/25/cronut_online_preorder_system_falte.php", "image": "http://gothamist.com/assets_c/2013/11/112513cronutglitch-thumb-640xauto-819485.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "WHY GOD?", "title": "Online Cronut Preorder System Goes Full Obamacare", "url": "http://gothamist.com/2013/11/25/cronut_online_preorder_system_falte.php", "image": "http://gothamist.com/assets_c/2013/11/112513cronutglitch-thumb-640xauto-819485.jpg", "site": "@gothamist", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 13927915491}, "viewport": "width=device-width, height=device-height, initial-scale=1.0", "vr": {"category": "food", "author": "Nell Casey"}}, "article_summary": "People, naturally, are pissed:THE CRONUT PREORDER WEBSITE ISN'T WORKING I JUST WANT A CHOCOLATE CHAMPAGNE AND ORANGE ZEST CRONUT \u2014 Weston G (@wonderfulweston) November 25, 2013SCREW the cronut preorder website--which is less functional than the Obamacare website-- and my friends in SF that I'm doing this for.\nSays they are available when they aren't.. \u2014 Masha D.
