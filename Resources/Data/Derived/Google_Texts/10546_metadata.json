Their opponent, however, was wearing a blindfold in a corner of the bakery.\n\nPlaying entirely by memory, world-renowned chess grandmaster Timur Gareev defeated some of the state\u2019s best \u2014 who also had the advantage of sight. A small crowd huddled around the entourage and game boards to watch one of Gareev\u2019s training pit stops, the latest in his quest toward 50 simultaneous games.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not the biggest that I could do, but they\u2019re the best for my practice and sharing my passion for blindfold chess,\u201d Gareev said of the 10- to 20-person matches he arranges across the country.\n\nYoung players poked Gareev\u2019s arms, and veterans of the game extended their hands when they asked for his autograph in the Corner Bakery Cafe on Denver\u2019s 16th Street Mall.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s like a Justin Bieber to us,\u201d said Brian Wall, a chess veteran.\n\nBrad Lundstrom, vice president of the Colorado State Chess Association, and other organizers of this rare style of play called out coordinates of players\u2019 moves, which Gareev quietly contemplated before responding with his own move\u2019s coordinates.\n\nHis opponents included youngsters, including 7-year-old Pristine Cyril and her 8-year-old brother, Rahul Ghosh, who have done well in competitions through their Fort Collins club, Chess Mates.\n\n\u201cI like beating people up,\u201d Pristine said of why she enjoys chess. \u201cBut mostly what I like to do is just play.\u201d\n\nGareev, 25, became a grandmaster when he was 16. He asked his opponents to tell him their name and what their corner of Colorado is known for \u2014 in case he ever visits. Gareev, a native of Uzbekistan who lives in California, had never been to Colorado and reached out to Wall to organize the trip here.\n\n\u201cI was interested to get to know the city,\u201d he said. \u201cI wanted to experience Colorado.\u201d\n\nWorking toward beating the world record of 46 simultaneous games, Gareev adds two or three opponents to each of his large matches. He played 35 people at once in September, 33 in May and 27 in December.\n\nAlison Noon: 303-954-1223, anoon@denverpost.com", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "15 Coloradans challenge blindfolded chess master \u2013 at once", "title": "15 Coloradans challenge blindfolded chess master \u2013 at once", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/11/02/15-coloradans-challenge-blindfolded-chess-master-at-once/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131102__chess1p1.jpg", "height": 399}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131102__chess1p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-11-02T19:25:31+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-29T11:32:05+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Fifteen Colorado chess players sat across from empty chairs Saturday, some for more than five hours.\n\u201cThey\u2019re not the biggest that I could do, but they\u2019re the best for my practice and sharing my passion for blindfold chess,\u201d Gareev said of the 10- to 20-person matches he arranges across the country.\nPlaying entirely by memory, world-renowned chess grandmaster Timur Gareev defeated some of the state\u2019s best \u2014 who also had the advantage of sight.\n\u201cHe\u2019s like a Justin Bieber to us,\u201d said Brian Wall, a chess veteran.\nHe asked his opponents to tell him their name and what their corner of Colorado is known for \u2014 in case he ever visits."}
