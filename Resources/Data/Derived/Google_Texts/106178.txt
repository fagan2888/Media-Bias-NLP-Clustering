Bill Clinton delivered some wise words during a recent CNBC interview, implicitly pushing back against President Obama’s message of corporate class war.

Clinton was asked whether “inversions” — American companies pursuing foreign mergers to escape the higher corporate tax rate in the US — were “unpatriotic.” The topic burst into the news this summer when Burger King plans to acquire the Tim Horton coffee and donut chain and set up shop in Canada became public.

Of course inversions aren’t unpatriotic, the 42nd president rightly said. Publicly traded companies “feel duty bound to pay the lowest taxes they can pay” — and inversions enable that to happen.

Clinton admitted he’d contributed to the present fix because he hiked corporate tax rates during his term in office to fight the deficit.

But since then, he pointed out, America’s biggest competitors have cut their rates.

“We have the highest overall corporate-tax rates in the world,” says Clinton, “and we are now the only [major] country that also taxes overseas earnings.”

Clinton’s understanding of the role of high tax rates contrasts sharply with an Obama administration that has dealt with inversions by imposing new regulations or trying to “shame” companies with the patriotism card. Neither has worked.

At the 2012 Democratic Convention, President Obama paid tribute to the economic growth during the Clinton years.

He would do well to take the advice of the Democratic president who gave us that growth — and fix the corporate-tax code so American companies don’t have to choose between their country and their shareholders.
