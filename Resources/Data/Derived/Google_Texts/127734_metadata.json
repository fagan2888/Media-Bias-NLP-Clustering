They didn\u2019t stop until they reached the fenced edge of a 1,000-acre patch of Fort Collins\u2019 Soapstone Prairie Natural Area and Larimer County\u2019s Red Mountain Open Space. The areas cover 37,000 acres of short-grass prairie along Colorado\u2019s northern Front Range.\n\nBringing back bison here marks a fresh use of city and county land preserved for recreation at a time when U.S. bison recovery efforts rely on insufficiently large federal refuges and tribal lands.\n\nIt also stands out as an application of high-tech reproduction technology to boost a once-imperiled species. Colorado State University has set up the equivalent of a fertility clinic where reproduction physiologists wash away the brucellosis disease from Yellowstone-line embryos \u2014 opening a robust new gene pool. Built up from a handful when native bison were vanishing, the Yellowstone herd until now has been largely shut out of breeding to restore wild traits.\n\nAmerican Indians led a celebration Sunday with prayers and songs. \u201cIn the past, the buffalo was to be exterminated. To us, it was a way to exterminate the natives,\u201d said A.J. Not Afraid, 39, secretary-elect of the Crow Nation.\n\nThe Crow have restored 1,800 bison to reservation land in south-central Montana, adding to federal herds on refuges and Bureau of Land Management areas such as the herds in Utah\u2019s Henry Mountains and on Antelope Island.\n\nFor too long, bison declined yet they are \u201ca national animal, like the eagle,\u201d Not Afraid said. \u201cAnd their survival depends on these conservation programs. The tribes cannot do it alone.\u201d\n\nFort Collins and Larimer officials at first wanted bison to enhance their open space for people. But CSU teamed with the city and county, and U.S. Department of Agriculture experts, in a broader effort to boost bison genetics. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping this continues to be a very successful partnership \u2014 and that the herd grows to upwards of 30 animals,\u201d said Mark Sears, Fort Collins\u2019 natural areas manager.\n\nSunday\u2019s transfer from pen to prairie fits the federal government-led push to restore genetically robust herds, said Jennifer Barfield, a CSU reproduction physiologist and assistant professor managing reproduction. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have the Yellowstone genetics, which are difficult to obtain.\u201d\n\nOnce numbering more than 20 million, bison migrated across North American grasslands before they were hunted to near extinction around 1900.\n\nThe Department of Interior is building 17 restoration herds \u2014 about 10,000 bison overall on 4.6 million acres in 12 states. These are meant to be the most genetically robust bison, different from bison with genetic connections to cattle. But lack of room to roam has forced culling of the herds each year, including the thriving 89 bison at the Rocky Mountain Arsenal National Wildlife Refuge north of Denver.\n\nBringing back bison at Soapstone matters \u201cbecause we\u2019re getting another population out on the landscape,\u201d said Steve Torbit, assistant regional director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, who chairs the federal Bison Working Group.\n\n\u201cThese are likely some of the most genetically pure bison in the country,\u201d Torbit said.\n\nAll the bison released Sunday are females, weighing up to 1,200 pounds, except for one 500-pound male, AI3 \u2014 the yearling offspring of #50.\n\nCSU managers\u2019 plan is to deploy a full range of techniques including artificial insemination, flushing embryos and implanting them in other bison, and natural breeding. They don\u2019t manipulate DNA.\n\nIn a reproduction and biotechnology lab, Barfield and crew mix drops of the enzyme Trypsin into dishes where embroyos in fluid are washed, removing any brucellosis from the surface. Beyond increasing the size of the herd, they say they eventually will ensure enough genetic diversity so that the bison could breed and survive on their own.\n\nBruce Finley: 303-954-1700, bfinley@denverpost.com or @finleybruce", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Restored bison near Fort Collins bolt to prairie open space", "title": "Restored bison near Fort Collins bolt to prairie open space", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/11/01/restored-bison-near-fort-collins-bolt-to-prairie-open-space/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151031__20151101_B6_CD01FOCOBISONJPICp1.jpg", "height": 445}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151031__20151101_B6_CD01FOCOBISONJPICp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-01T20:12:21+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-20T03:18:41+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Animals, Wildlife"}, "article_summary": "These are meant to be the most genetically robust bison, different from bison with genetic connections to cattle.\nThey didn\u2019t stop until they reached the fenced edge of a 1,000-acre patch of Fort Collins\u2019 Soapstone Prairie Natural Area and Larimer County\u2019s Red Mountain Open Space.\nThe tribes cannot do it alone.\u201dFort Collins and Larimer officials at first wanted bison to enhance their open space for people.\nFish and Wildlife Service, who chairs the federal Bison Working Group.\nLARIMER COUNTY \u2014 Ten pure bison bolted from a pen into open space Sunday \u2014 cheered by 400 supporters and reproduction managers \u2014 hoof steps forward in a growing national project of restoring bison to the prairie."}
