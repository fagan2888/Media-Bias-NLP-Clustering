And Wright-Phillips \u2014 an Englishman who grew up watching Henry \u2014 pointed out that during the 2002-3 Premier League season, Henry played 37 games and finished with 24 goals and 23 assists.\n\nBut Henry said the style of play in M.L.S. and the demands of the Red Bulls in particular meant that he found himself inhabiting different parts of the field from his play in other leagues. Instead of leading the attack from up front, he can more often be found roaming and playmaking.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cThe game is asking me to do that here a bit more,\u201d Henry said.\n\nPetke said he would never think to shackle a player as gifted as Henry, who sometimes drifts back into the team\u2019s defensive half to find the ball. \u201cAt times, it hasn\u2019t been pretty,\u201d Petke said of giving Henry the reins to the offense. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t always worked out perfectly. But when it does, it\u2019s beautiful.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIt has worked out quite a bit of late, largely because of Wright-Phillips, a London native whose father, Ian, preceded Henry as Arsenal\u2019s top striker. Wright-Phillips signed with the Red Bulls on July 23, 2013, after bouncing around five clubs in England over the previous eight seasons. But it took some time for him to find his place.\n\nIn games and practices with the Red Bulls, even earlier this year, Wright-Phillips chased the ball too much, roaming across wide stretches of grass, trying to make things happen. He said that he played like a headless chicken at times, and because of that was rarely in the right place: He scored only twice in nine games.\n\nPetke started to pressure Wright-Phillips about refining his movement, at times setting up an imaginary electric fence between the two opposing central defenders and discouraging him from wandering outside it. Wright-Phillips embraced the instruction, focusing on making short, darting runs across the defense or looping behind it, and the strategy quickly began to pay dividends.\n\nWright-Phillips locked down the starting job for this season in mid-April after a three-goal performance against the Houston Dynamo. At the time, he said he knew a goal or two would greatly help his standing in the team, and the pressure weighed on him.\n\n\u201cI wanted a chance, and at the same time, I was scared to miss it,\u201d Wright-Phillips said. \u201cBut Thierry put one on a plate for me. I just remember thinking, Get on the end of it. And it went in, and from then, I haven\u2019t really looked back.\u201d\n\nWright-Phillips, whose next goal would tie the team\u2019s single-season record, said that Henry gave him advice daily, but that he learned just as much from watching him.\n\nWright-Phillips\u2019s growing confidence was clearest during a five-day stretch this month. On Aug. 2, he scored a spectacular goal against the New England Revolution, controlling a long ball on the run, wiggling his hips and cutting the ball onto his left foot to lose a defender before curling a shot inside the far post.\n\nFour days later, against Bayern Munich in the M.L.S. All-Star game, he bounded onto a bouncing ball, settled it with a single touch and blasted a left-footed shot that knuckled under the crossbar.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if he would have done that six months ago,\u201d Henry said of the two goals. \u201cBut that\u2019s just the way it is. When you\u2019re in the zone, everything goes.\u201d\n\nWright-Phillips has two years left on his deal with the Red Bulls, and whether he remains in this form could hinge in part on Henry, whose contract expires after this season.\n\nAndy Roxburgh, the team\u2019s sporting director, said that he and Henry had discussed the player\u2019s future at various times. But nothing has been decided, he said, and neither wanted to discuss it publicly.\n\nMany people, including G\u00e9rard Houllier, the head of soccer operations for Red Bull, which owns clubs around the world, have speculated that Henry will retire after this season. Henry could also join a European club over the winter and finish his career on the continent where it began.\n\n\u201cWe have a long, long, long off-season,\u201d Henry said, smiling. \u201cSo I can think. I have the time.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "feature", "ptime": 20140823130225, "twitter": {"description": "Bradley Wright-Phillips, a revelation for the Red Bulls this year, attributed much of his goal-scoring success to Thierry Henry, the former Arsenal goal scorer who has embraced his role as a playmaker.", "title": "Henry\u2019s Artistry Inspires His Latest Strike Partner", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/24/sports/soccer/thierry-henrys-artistry-inspires-his-latest-strike-partner.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003071401"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/08/24/sports/dog-soccer1/dog-soccer1-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/24/sports/soccer/thierry-henrys-artistry-inspires-his-latest-strike-partner.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003071401", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/24/sports/soccer/thierry-henrys-artistry-inspires-his-latest-strike-partner.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "sports/soccer", "hdl_p": "Henry\u2019s Artistry Inspires His Latest Strike Partner", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/sports/soccer/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Aug. 23, 2014", "edt": "NewYork", "org": "Montreal Impact (Soccer Team)", "keywords": "Soccer,New York Red Bulls (Soccer Team),Henry  Thierry,Wright-Phillips  Bradley,Petke  Mike,Houllier  Gerard,Major League Soccer,Montreal Impact (Soccer Team)", "news_keywords": "Soccer", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Andrew Keh", "SCG": "soccer", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "per": "Houllier, Gerard", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "byl": "By ANDREW KEH", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "Bradley Wright-Phillips, a revelation for the Red Bulls this year, attributed much of his goal-scoring success to Thierry Henry, the former Arsenal goal scorer who has embraced his role as a playmaker.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/08/24/sports/dog-soccer1/dog-soccer1-thumbStandard.jpg", "description": "Bradley Wright-Phillips, a revelation for the Red Bulls this year, attributed much of his goal-scoring success to Thierry Henry, the former Arsenal goal scorer who has embraced his role as a playmaker.", "CG": "sports", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Aug. 23, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"section": "Soccer", "modified": "2014-08-29", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/sports/soccer/index.jsonp", "tag": "Montreal Impact (Soccer Team)", "published": "2014-08-23", "section-taxonomy-id": "DE2B278B-2783-4506-AAD5-C15A5BB6DA1A"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "slug": "24soccer", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20140829111328, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/24/sports/soccer/thierry-henrys-artistry-inspires-his-latest-strike-partner.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/08/24/sports/dog-soccer1/dog-soccer1-videoSixteenByNine1050.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Bradley Wright-Phillips, a revelation for the Red Bulls this year, attributed much of his goal-scoring success to Thierry Henry, the former Arsenal goal scorer who has embraced his role as a playmaker.", "title": "Henry\u2019s Artistry Inspires His Latest Strike Partner"}, "pdate": 20140823, "des": "Soccer", "articleid": 100000003071401, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Henry\u2019s Artistry Inspires His Latest Strike Partner", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/08/24/sports/dog-soccer1/dog-soccer1-thumbLarge.jpg", "PST": "News"}, "_id": "\"57477af56914bd0286fe5269\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWe have a long, long, long off-season,\u201d Henry said, smiling.\nand the demands of the Red Bulls in particular meant that he found himself inhabiting different parts of the field from his play in other leagues.\nWright-Phillips signed with the Red Bulls on July 23, 2013, after bouncing around five clubs in England over the previous eight seasons.\nAnd Wright-Phillips \u2014 an Englishman who grew up watching Henry \u2014 pointed out that during the 2002-3 Premier League season, Henry played 37 games and finished with 24 goals and 23 assists.\nHenry could also join a European club over the winter and finish his career on the continent where it began."}
