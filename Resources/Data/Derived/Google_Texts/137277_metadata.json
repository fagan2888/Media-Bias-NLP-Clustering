This adds up to about 35 million beats in a year and 2.5 billion beats in an average lifetime.\n\nMedical science tells us that every contraction is similar to the effort it would take for us to hold a tennis ball in our palm and give it a good, hard squeeze. Yet as amazing as our heart is, it\u2019s only one example of a natural world that is designed to tell us something about our creator and savior.\n\nThe word \u201cheart\u201d is used hundreds of times in the Bible. Jesus, when asked what\u2019s the most important thing in the world, responded by saying, \u201cThe first of all commandments is ... you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind and with all your strength. And the second, like it, is this: \u2018You shall love your neighbor as yourself. There is no other commandment greater than these.\u2019\u201d (Mark 12:31).\n\nAt this wonderful time of the year, there\u2019s something more lasting and appreciative than giving gifts to family and friends at Christmas. Our love to others will far outlast and mean more than the finest gift we could choose.\n\nJesus Christ, our powerful and victorious savior, came as a helpless and innocent baby to offer us his love and hope and asks us to invite him into our spiritual hearts. His warm love has changed cold hearts and the world.\n\nThis joyous season is our opportunity to start to follow his example throughout the new year.\n\nJohn Sivertsen,\n\nAppleton\n\nRead or Share this story: http://post.cr/16yvIw3", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "In this Christmas season, we can follow Jesus\u2019 example.", "og": {"site_name": "Post-Crescent Media", "description": "In this Christmas season, we can follow Jesus\u2019 example.", "title": "Letters: Our love for others is the greatest gift", "url": "http://www.postcrescent.com/story/opinion/readers/2014/12/19/letters-love-others-greatest-gift/20588931/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/postcrescent.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "In this Christmas season, we can follow Jesus\u2019 example.", "title": "Letters: Our love for others is the greatest gift", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/84f57bb000c2559f5888e5e9b261e733458a9047/c=430-0-3923-3493&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Appleton/2014/12/18/B9315550742Z.1_20141218123525_000_GDQ9EPQLL.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@postcrescent", "site": "@postcrescent", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=880652726", "fb": {"app_id": 117306038338949}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3341\"", "article_summary": "And the second, like it, is this: \u2018You shall love your neighbor as yourself.\nOur love to others will far outlast and mean more than the finest gift we could choose.\nWorld Human Hands Holding Word Give (Photo: Getty Images/iStockphoto)Our heart beats about 100,000 times every day, pumping blood to every cell in our bodies.\nThe word \u201cheart\u201d is used hundreds of times in the Bible.\nHis warm love has changed cold hearts and the world."}
