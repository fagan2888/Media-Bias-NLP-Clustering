But this week saw the 42nd anniversary of the Supreme Court decision Roe v. Wade, and all these years later, the ideological canyon separating opponents in the fight over abortion seems just as impossible to bridge.\n\nIn the US House of Representatives Thursday, the temptation to use Roe v. Wade\u2019s anniversary as a chance to vote on anti-abortion legislation was simply to great to pass up. But it was the legislation they didn\u2019t vote on that made the nightly news.\n\nInstead of voting on a 20 week restriction that included stringent requirements in the case of rape or incest, the House passed a bill doubling down on its existing stance not to provide federal funds for abortions. In Washington D.C. thousands of demonstrators marched, and the occasion brought activists to the Florida Capitol, too.\n\nBarbara Devane is the lobbyist for the Florida chapter of the National Organization for Women. She organized the rally on the Capitol steps along with representatives from Planned Parenthood.\n\nDevane frames the argument in terms of social equality, claiming rich women never had trouble getting abortions.\n\n\u201cThis is not about rich women,\u201d Devane says. \u201cThis is about helping women that need the most help, and that\u2019s poor women, poor working women, middle-class working women who can\u2019t afford to fly out of this country or to another state if need be.\u201d\n\nJoining the group was Rep. Lori Berman (D-Boynton Beach).\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe that we have to stand here again on another anniversary of Roe v. Wade, and be under attack and be worried about our right to make choices that affect our health care and our lives,\u201d Berman said.\n\nAmong those attacks is Rep. Charles Van Zant\u2019s (R-Keystone Heights) perennial \u201cFlorida is For Life Act\u201d. He\u2019s filed the bill six years running.\n\nVan Zant\u2019s proposals have drawn criticism for denying abortions even in the case of rape or incest, and because they might not pass constitutional muster. But there\u2019s another bill coming up this session that approaches abortion differently. Like bills passed in a handful of other states this measure requires physicians performing abortions to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital.\n\nIt\u2019s being proposed by Rep. Mike Hill (R-Pensacola). Hill says the intent of his bill is to protect the health of the mother by ensuring the doctor performing the procedure will be on hand to address any complications that might arise.\n\n\u201cIf right now there is some complication to that surgical procedure, then the doctor who\u2019s performing that procedure simply calls emergency, they come pick up the woman, and then that doctor just washes his hands of the whole issue,\u201d Hill says.\n\nBut Berman isn\u2019t buying the women\u2019s health claims.\n\n\u201cI mean that\u2019s the purported idea and that\u2019s what is proposed, but in reality it\u2019s a fallacious argument,\u201d Berman says.\n\nBerman argues it can be difficult for doctors to gain admitting privileges, and there\u2019s little medical reason for it to begin with. The mortality rate for women getting abortions is extremely low. According to former president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, Jeanne Conry, it\u2019s lower in fact than colonoscopies. In some states, similar requirements have made it significantly more difficult for women to access abortion services, and Berman fears the same could happen in Florida if the bill passes.\n\nIt\u2019s too soon to say whether the bill has a shot in the coming session, but unfortunately, it seems clear the argument won\u2019t be settled before Roe turns 43.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"category": "HNF Stories", "description": "Some say time heals all wounds.\u00a0 But this week saw the 42nd anniversary of the Supreme Court decision Roe v.
