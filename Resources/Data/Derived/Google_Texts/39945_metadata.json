Inflation is basically nonexistent. The federal budget deficit has been slashed dramatically. The stock market is reaching all-time highs. One of our long-running wars is over, and the other is winding down. The status of the United States as the world\u2019s preeminent economic and military power is unchallenged.\n\nSo why is everyone so depressed?\n\nThe sour public attitude toward elected officials in general \u2014 and the Republican Party in particular \u2014 is understandable. Indeed, the wonder is that pollsters can find anyone beyond paid staffers who will express approval of Congress. And as for the White House, the rollout of the Affordable Care Act does not scream competence and efficiency.\n\nBut overall, whether by accident or design, things are actually going rather well. Years from now, when someday the nation is mired in another recession or bogged down in another ill-conceived war, these may be remembered as the good old days.\n\nLast week\u2019s announcement that the U.S. economy grew at a 2.8 percent annual rate in the third quarter was stunning. It came with caveats, of course, because everything seems to come with caveats these days. Some doomsayers warned, for various arcane reasons, that it was the wrong kind of growth. But even the gloomiest of analysts had to acknowledge that the figure \u2014 almost a full percentage point higher than predicted \u2014 showed that the economic recovery is more robust than previously believed.\n\n1 of 11 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 10 myths about Obama (that people actually believe) View Photos We\u2019ve all heard them: Misinformation about President Obama has a penchant for spreading like wildfire.

The Post\u2019s Swati Sharma attempts to set a few matters straight. We\u2019ve all heard them: Misinformation about President Obama has a penchant for spreading like wildfire. Dana Milbank offers a few answers for the reasons, as he characterizes it , that the Kenyan born Muslim raised in a madrassa president somehow attracts lies and rumors that are far from the truth. As for the rumors themselves, we have compiled a list that aren't the most outrageous but have a surprising base of believers.

This would have been enough to keep unemployment on its well-established downward trend \u2014 if not for the government shutdown, which furloughed enough federal workers to send the jobless rate up a notch to 7.3 percent. Let\u2019s have another round of applause for Congress.\n\nIn isolation, these numbers look pretty good. Compared with the rest of the world, they look really good. The United States doesn\u2019t have structurally high unemployment (like Europe), an addiction to overheated growth rates (like China) or mounting inflation (like major developing nations). Slow and steady may be boring, but it\u2019s better than many exciting alternatives.\n\nThe federal deficit for fiscal 2013 was just $680 billion. That sounds like a lot of money \u2014 all right, it is a lot of money \u2014 but it\u2019s an incredible 37 percent less than the deficit for fiscal 2012.\n\nSharply lower deficits plus faster economic growth add up to a significantly brighter long-term fiscal outlook. The nation\u2019s $17 trillion debt remains a problem to be sensibly addressed and solved. But it can no longer be represented as a crisis requiring an immediate decision to deny Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid benefits to Americans who need them.\n\nIf you listen to President Obama\u2019s critics, especially his Republican adversaries on Capitol Hill, you\u2019d think the economy was wheezing its last gasps. But investors obviously disagree, since the Dow closed Monday at a record high \u2014 and has nearly doubled since Obama took office. Put simply, money talks.\n\nMeanwhile, the nation is \u2014 almost \u2014 at peace, with Obama having brought the troops home from Iraq and announced a withdrawal from Afghanistan by the end of 2014. The fight against widely dispersed terrorist groups continues, but that\u2019s a different kind of war. Polls show minuscule public support for a return to the days when hundreds of thousands of U.S. troops were sent halfway around the world in an attempt at reshaping nations and regions that did not want to be reshaped.\n\nCritics howl that U.S. power and influence are somehow being surrendered. But who really believes that? The notion that peace would blossom in the Middle East if only the United States were willing to invade a few more countries is absurd. The notion that any other nation has an equivalent capacity to take decisive military action \u2014 when it is necessary \u2014 is ridiculous. Of course our allies are complaining about naive, wrongheaded thinking in Washington. That\u2019s what allies have always done and will always do.\n\nThis is not to say that the Obama administration hasn\u2019t made mistakes. But by historical standards, the United States is doing well domestically and internationally. And by any objective measure, the trend lines are positive, not negative.\n\nPerhaps this is why politicians and commentators have enough time on their hands to occupy themselves \u2014 and worry everyone else half to death \u2014 by pretending that the sky is falling.\n\nRead more from Eugene Robinson\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.
