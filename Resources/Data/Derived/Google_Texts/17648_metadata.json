Study participants completed the survey's vision and reproductive health questionnaire and underwent eye exams. The study found women who used oral contraceptives, no matter which kind, for longer than three years were 2.05 times more likely to also report a diagnosis of glaucoma.\n\nOther side effects of oral contraception include blood clots, heart problems, and liver issues. NuvaRing, another form of contraception that consists of a ring that is inserted vaginally, is currently the subject of a lawsuit and is alleged to have caused the deaths of thousands of young women.\n\nIs it really a good idea to encourage these pills to be widely distributed?", "article_metadata": {"description": "May not be so helpful for the health of a woman. .05/24/2016 2:00:07AM EST.", "author": "Christine Rousselle", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "May not be so helpful for the health of a woman.", "title": "Christine Rousselle - Study Shows Contraception Use Increases Glaucoma Risk", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/christinerousselle/2014/01/12/study-shows-contraception-use-increases-glaucoma-risk-n1777203", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2013/157/0ee27d1a-1633-4fc5-8b2b-609f57c82a05.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "May not be so helpful for the health of a woman.", "title": "Christine Rousselle - Study Shows Contraception Use Increases Glaucoma Risk", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/christinerousselle/2014/01/12/study-shows-contraception-use-increases-glaucoma-risk-n1777203", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2013/157/0ee27d1a-1633-4fc5-8b2b-609f57c82a05.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Study Shows Contraception Use Increases Glaucoma Risk, Christine Rousselle, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca534\"", "article_summary": "In the midst of the Obama administration's epic battle against a group of nuns over the HHS contraception mandate, new research has come out showing that oral contraception use increases the risk of glaucoma in women.\nOther side effects of oral contraception include blood clots, heart problems, and liver issues.\nStudy participants completed the survey's vision and reproductive health questionnaire and underwent eye exams.\nThe study found women who used oral contraceptives, no matter which kind, for longer than three years were 2.05 times more likely to also report a diagnosis of glaucoma.\nResearched showed that women who used oral contraception for over a three-year period were more than two times as likely to report being diagnosed with glaucoma than women who did not use birth control pills."}
