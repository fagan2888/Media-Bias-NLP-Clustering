Roy Blunt, R-Mo., where the marchers covered the windows with Post-it notes detailing the actions they would like to see him take.\n\n\u201cWe need the U.S. to be leading the move to a low-carbon future,\u201d said George Laur, a spokesman for Citizens\u2019 Climate Lobby.\n\nLaura Wacker, spokeswoman for Peaceworks, an organization focused on social justice education, said she agrees the government should prioritize combating climate change over other legislative agenda.\n\n\u201cWhether or not we have an Earth to live on in the next 50 years is a little more important than whether we have Obamacare,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re here to say, \u2018It\u2019s time for you to act for the people, not for the corporations.\u2019\u201d\n\nAccording to Andrew Linhares, staff attorney for Renew Missouri, coal and gas are the main opponents of environmental legislation because emission-reducing actions, such as carbon taxes, would hurt energy companies\u2019 profits.\n\nLinhares said it has been difficult to persuade energy companies to focus on renewable energies over fossil fuel.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to convince an entire industry that\u2019s basically been ruling the globe for the last hundred years to divest itself from (oil and coal),\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take a loud, loud message from the public.\u201d\n\nLeaders of various organizations, such as Rev. Knute Jacobson of the Calvary Episcopal Church, made speeches in addition to the march. Jacobson described environmental activism as protecting God\u2019s creation.\n\n\u201cGod created the planet we live on, and it was created for a purpose,\u201d Jacobson said. \u201cAnd that purpose was to sustain, to be the ground of being, to sustain life.\u201d\n\nSami Tellatin, a senior at MU and spokeswoman for the Mizzou Energy Action Coalition, said that the current generation \u201cis responsible for picking up the pieces,\u201d and emphasizing a need for smarter energy use in addition to greener energy.\n\nCity Councilwoman Barbara Hoppe said the City Council has made efforts toward making the city greener.\n\nHoppe said the city is working to increase its share of renewable energy use to 30 percent by 2022 and improve the bus system in order to reduce emissions from cars.\n\nHowever, the march in Columbia is only a small part of a much larger movement.\n\nMissouri Energy Action Coalition (MEAC) Director Kelsey Wingo, the People\u2019s Climate March took place in New York City and drew over 285,000 people and 1,400 different organizations from across the nation, including MEAC.\n\nWingo said the event was timed to take place just two days before a UN summit on global warming.\n\nPeaceworks Director Mark Hiam spoke to the Columbia marchers via an audio feed from the march in New York.\n\n\u201cThe movement is going to come out of here greatly strengthened,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.themaneater.com/stories/2014/9/22/climate-activists-march-columbia/", "image": "http://www.themaneater.com/media/2014/0922/photos/PCM004.001_JPG_900x600_q85.jpg", "description": "More than 100 activists marched from the Boone County Courthouse to Sen.
