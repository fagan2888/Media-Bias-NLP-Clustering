No one on council seemed surprised.\n\n\u201cPlease accept this letter of resignation from my position as Village Administrator, my last effective day with the village will be February 14, 2014,\u201d stated the letter dated Jan. 15. \u201cI feel blessed that I have had the opportunity to work with some (exceptional) members of staff and members of council.\u201d\n\nEberle said the village would advertise for the position immediately.\n\nHe added that he had someone in mind for the interim position but that he had not talked to the person yet.\n\nPauley left the meeting quickly and could not be reached for further comment. Council, however, entered into an executive session to discuss plans for an interim administrator and then to hire a permanent replacement.\n\nPauley, who signed a $72,155 annual salary contract with the village three years ago, was up for a possible contract renewal in March. He has been a village employee since 2009.\n\nBut his tenure with the village has not been a smooth run. Tensions have been building for months between the staff and Pauley over various issues. The recent departure of longtime public power division superintendent Barry Reau has been attributed to the strained relationship between employees and the administration.\n\nWord of the resignation even hit the streets prior to the meeting.\n\nAdam Snyder, a regular at village council meetings, has publicly criticized Pauley on numerous occasions.\n\nSnyder stood at the beginning of the meeting and asked the mayor if Pauley was leaving the village job.\n\nEberle politely told him that he would address the issue later in the meeting.\n\nSnyder then produced a copy of a story dated Jan. 6. that said the village council of Brewster, Ohio, in Stark County approved Pauley as its new village administrator.\n\nThe mayor reiterated the issue would be dealt with later.\n\nSnyder then turned to Pauley and directly asked him if he had informed the Brewster council that he had been previously censured by the International City/County Management Association\u2019s executive board for unethical behavior in 2009. The censure, of which he held a copy, noted that Pauley had accepted a job from the town of Sunbury, Pa. However, 10 days before he was supposed to begin work, he withdrew his acceptance with no explanation.\n\nShortly after, he began working for Oak Harbor. The association board explained that members who accept bona fide offers are expected to fulfill their commitments.\n\nThe mayor interrupted again. \u201cThis is not relevant to the meeting.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think I should have a say after how I was treated,\u201d Snyder responded, regarding his bouts with Pauley over a number of issues brought to council\u2019s attention by Snyder at previous meetings.\n\nThe mayor sternly repeated \u201cThis is not relevant to the meeting\u201d and Snyder sat down.\n\n\n\nInsurance rates climb\n\nCouncil approved renewal of the employee Medical Mutual health insurance program, including a tiered increase in the employee cost share: a 2 percent hike starting Feb. 1 and another 2 percent on Aug. 1.\n\nCouncilwoman Jackie Macko proposed the tiered increase instead of a single hike closer to 5 percent.\n\nThe core health plan is $5 biweekly for a single plan and $16.50 for a family plan. However, the program offers a number of plans based on service options.\n\nThe village had to stay below a 5 percent increase in order to keep its plan grandfathered from some of the changes enacted by the Affordable Care Act.\n\nA third of the $33,000 annual plan increase is directly caused by fees created by the act, councilman Jim Seaman said.\n\nThe village will absorb the remainder of the costs not covered by the staff premium increases. The share breakdown was not available Tuesday.\n\nFiscal officer Debbie Carpenter noted that the council had prepared for a possible rate increase by building a cushion into the 2014 budget. But she could not answer any of their questions on the total sum available because the figures had been broken down by department. She promised she would provide them with the figures as soon as possible.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Oak Harbor, Robert Pauley, Bill Eberle, Adam Snyder, Jackie Macko, Debbie Carpenter", "fb": {"app_id": 481362985325425}, "author": "Cynthia L.
