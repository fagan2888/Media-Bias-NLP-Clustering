Though often sparked by an infection, and already suspected to be connected to Zika specifically, the cases of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 associated with Zika are the first to be detected stateside. The link between Zika and Guillain-Barre \"looks strong and would not be at all surprising,\" Dr. Tom Frieden, director of the CDC told Time. \"We\u2019ve seen similar postinfection complications after many different infections, including some that are quite similar to Zika. That is a link that\u2019s getting stronger.\"\n\nGuillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome is an autoimmune disorder that targets the peripheral nervous system, which, among many other functions, helps control our ability to move and feel. The resulting damage leads to muscle weakness, tingling leg sensations, and even temporary paralysis. In the most severe and rare of cases, that paralysis affects a person\u2019s respiratory or circulatory system, leading to life-threatening complications. And while most sufferers do generally recover, 30 percent still feel a degree of weakness after 3 years, according to the National Institute on Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS). Unlike microcephaly, Guillain-Barr\u00e9 can happen at any age.\n\nZika\u2019s connection to Guillain-Barr\u00e9 has been theorized prior to the documented rise in the number of microcephalic infants born in areas where Zika had newly emerged. In 2013, a large Zika outbreak hit the island nation of French Polynesia; five weeks later, there was an increase in Guillain-Barr\u00e9 cases. As reported by NPR, while there was previously an average of two Guillain-Barr\u00e9 cases a year, 2013-2014 saw 42 diagnosed cases. The subsequent rush of scientific attention now being paid to Zika has since uncovered more evidence of increased Guillain-Barr\u00e9 cases in Zika-infected areas, including Brazil.\n\nAs with microcephaly, though, this link still isn\u2019t definitive, and it should be noted that Guillain-Barr\u00e9 remains a very rare occurrence. According to the NINDS, only about one in 100,000 people will come down with the disorder. For the time being, research efforts across the world are underway to better zero in and prove the connection to both conditions. As per Time, the CDC recently sent scientists to Brazil to conduct their own preliminary research on Guillain-Barr\u00e9, though their findings have not been published as of yet.\n\nEarlier this Sunday, South Africa became the latest nation to announce the mosquito-borne disease had compromised its borders, with a Columbian traveler having presented signs of Zika four days after arrival \u2014 the man subsequently recovered. The U.S. mainland has seen 82 confirmed cases of Zika brought over from other countries, while other territories such as Puerto Rico have reported nine locally acquired cases, both as of Feb. 17. According to Frieden, the potential for more Zika is inevitable.\n\n\"We really do expect that there will be hundreds, if not thousands, of travel-associated cases in the U.S.,\" said Frieden. \"There are more than 40 million travelers in the U.S. to Zika affected countries every year \u2014 that\u2019s a lot of people.\"", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "zika, virus, and, guillain, barre, syndrome, link, between, two, us, cases, and, neurological", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "CDC researchers confirm the presence of a rare neurological condition that causes paralysis in at least two U.S. Zika cases.", "title": "Zika May Cause Rare Neurological Disorder", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/zika-virus-guillain-barre-syndrome-link-374402", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2016/02/21/mosquito-netting.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "CDC researchers confirm the presence of a rare neurological condition that causes paralysis in at least two U.S. Zika cases.", "title": "Zika May Cause Rare Neurological Disorder", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/zika-virus-guillain-barre-syndrome-link-374402", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2016/02/21/mosquito-netting.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2016/02/21/mosquito-netting.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2016-02-21T19:02:43-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-21T19:02:42-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "CDC researchers confirm the presence of a rare neurological condition that causes paralysis in at least two U.S. Zika cases."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd4728\"", "article_summary": "As reported by NPR, while there was previously an average of two Guillain-Barr\u00e9 cases a year, 2013-2014 saw 42 diagnosed cases.\nIn 2013, a large Zika outbreak hit the island nation of French Polynesia; five weeks later, there was an increase in Guillain-Barr\u00e9 cases.\nThe subsequent rush of scientific attention now being paid to Zika has since uncovered more evidence of increased Guillain-Barr\u00e9 cases in Zika-infected areas, including Brazil.\nThe link between Zika and Guillain-Barre \"looks strong and would not be at all surprising,\" Dr. Tom Frieden, director of the CDC told Time.\nThough often sparked by an infection, and already suspected to be connected to Zika specifically, the cases of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 associated with Zika are the first to be detected stateside."}
