While on the Honda stage, RJD2, whose real name is Ramble John Krohn, scratched a majority (but not only) hip-hop slot. What set the DJ’s show apart was that he was backed by a live band — including a guitarist, drummer and congo player — that infused flavors off different genres and eras, such as ‘70s soul and rock.







After his “flying by the seat of the pants” performance, RJD2 spoke with Billboard about the growth of electronic music at music festivals.







“Electronic acts headlining festivals is impressive,” he says. “Ten years ago I would’ve never guessed in a million years that something as esoteric as beat-driven music, which can be largely instrumental, would be making a dent in popular culture.”
