Many have been forced to uproot and leave the city in order find proper facilities over the year. But as Eric Szeto reports, there was finally some positive news this week.\n\nEDMONTON \u2014 After years of delays and land disputes, Fort McMurray residents are hopeful construction on a new seniors\u2019 care facility will finally begin.\n\nIn an announcement made late last week, the provincial government said it had completed a deal to purchase the four-acre Willow Square site from the federal government. The government says it will now transfer the land to the Wood Buffalo Housing and Development Corporation to develop self-contained apartments and lodge units for low-income residents and seniors.\n\n\u201cAlberta families and seniors deserve accessible, comfortable and affordable housing options close to home,\u201d said Premier Jim Prentice. \u201cThis agreement will provide the municipality with the tools it needs to meet the community\u2019s varied housing needs.\u201d\n\nA lack of long-term care in the northern Alberta community has been a concern for residents for years. The local hospital is currently the only facility that offers long-term care. The hope is the new development will be an age-in-place facility where seniors can still live on their own, but can get the help they need as they transition from independent to assisted living.\n\n\u201cI think this is a first step to have local autonomy,\u201d said Iris Kirschner.\n\nThe Fort McMurray woman and her family have had a tough few years, after her mother fell ill and ended up in hospital. She died while waiting for long-term care at another facility. In the meantime, Iris\u2019s husband, Dave, was diagnosed with a terminal illness. Feeling they had no other option, the couple moved to Edmonton in 2013, leaving their children and grandchildren behind.\n\n\u201cWe knew what the reality of staying in Fort McMurray was and so we just thought that that was a real sign that we needed to go somewhere where Dave would have the dignity and privacy and the care that his condition requires,\u201d Iris said Sunday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like having our heart ripped out of us. I\u2019m fortunate enough to get to go back, but Dave can\u2019t, so that makes it tough.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE: Family of Fort McMurray dementia patient makes disturbing discovery\n\nThe province also announced Friday it would provide $3.2 million in funding to the Wood Buffalo Housing and Development Corporation to develop the site.\n\n\u201cThis is something that many in the Fort McMurray area have been working toward for a very long time,\u201d Don Scott, MLA Fort McMurray-Conklin, said Friday. Scott was speaking on behalf of Seniors Minister Jeff Johnson, who was unable to make the announcement due to poor road conditions.\n\n\u201cWe know there is a direct connection between having safe and stable housing and a person\u2019s overall wellbeing. Developing the Willow Square land is one tool the community has to meet its varied housing needs.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE: Alberta government announces more cash for rural senior lodges\n\nWhile the announcement is welcome news to Iris and Dave, they still have hesitations.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been eight years since they promised this. I don\u2019t know if the politicians have the will to act,\u201d said Dave, a former councillor for the municipality,\n\n\u201cNow we have to go through community consultation so it\u2019s still not a given that we\u2019re going to have it,\u201d added Iris. \u201cWe really need our community to get behind the seniors and understand that this is a need and a priority in our community.\n\n\u201cWhatever it is, we need to work together as a community and not point fingers at each other, but hold hands together and build this.\u201d\n\nThe facility will be mixed use and offer retail and office space in addition to seniors care. Shovels likely won\u2019t be in the ground before spring 2016.\n\nAnother long-term care facility is on the way for the area, the Parsons Creek development, which is expected to have 100 beds.\n\nFollow @CaleyRamsay", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "In an announcement made late last week, the provincial government said it had completed a deal to purchase the four-acre Willow Square site from the federal government.", "pubdate": "2014-11-23T20:11", "title": "Province completes land deal in Fort McMurray, making way for seniors\u2019 housing - Edmonton | Globalnews.ca", "og": {"site_name": "Global News", "description": "In an announcement made late last week, the provincial government said it had completed a deal to purchase the four-acre Willow Square site from the federal government.", "title": "Province completes land deal in Fort McMurray, making way for seniors\u2019 housing", "url": "http://globalnews.ca/news/1687799/province-completes-land-deal-in-fort-mcmurray-making-way-for-seniors-housing/", "see_also": "http://globalnews.ca/news/2688042/russia-offers-support-to-fight-fort-mcmurray-wildfire/", "image": "http://i0.wp.com/shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/fort-mac-housing.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C605px%2C403px&resize=720%2C480&quality=70&strip=all&ssl=1", "type": "article"}, "section": "Health", "author": "Caley Ramsay", "thumbnail": "http://i0.wp.com/shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/fort-mac-housing.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C605px%2C403px&resize=720%2C480&quality=70&strip=all&ssl=1", "dateCreated": "2014-11-23T20:11", "source": "Global News", "fb": {"app_id": 318812448281278}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "theme-color": "#133F6F", "application-name": "Global News", "keywords": "Willow Square, Alberta health, Fort McMurray, Long-term Care, Seniors Care, Health, News, Politics", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/GlobalNews", "section": "Health", "tag": "Politics", "published_time": "2014-11-23T20:11", "modified_time": "2014-11-23T20:40"}, "generator": "WordPress.com", "twitter": {"description": "In an announcement made late last week, the provincial government said it had completed a deal to purchase the four-acre Willow Square site from the federal government.", "title": "Province completes land deal in Fort McMurray, making way for seniors\u2019 housing", "url": "http://globalnews.ca/news/1687799/province-completes-land-deal-in-fort-mcmurray-making-way-for-seniors-housing/", "image": "http://i0.wp.com/shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/fort-mac-housing.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C605px%2C403px&resize=720%2C480&quality=70&strip=all&ssl=1", "site": "@globalnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://globalnews.ca/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/134ef81f5668dc78080f6bd19ca2310b?s=16", "news_keywords": "Willow Square, Alberta health, Fort McMurray, Long-term Care, Seniors Care, Health, News, Politics"}, "article_summary": "EDMONTON \u2014 After years of delays and land disputes, Fort McMurray residents are hopeful construction on a new seniors\u2019 care facility will finally begin.\nAnother long-term care facility is on the way for the area, the Parsons Creek development, which is expected to have 100 beds.\nWatch above: The need for more seniors\u2019 care in Fort McMurray is getting desperate.\n\u201cThis is something that many in the Fort McMurray area have been working toward for a very long time,\u201d Don Scott, MLA Fort McMurray-Conklin, said Friday.\nThe Fort McMurray woman and her family have had a tough few years, after her mother fell ill and ended up in hospital."}
