It happened outside the Hometown Buffet near Central and Ridge. Sgt. Ed Brower said a 24-year-old employee was leaving work when a man approached his car and demanded his keys.

When the employee refused, the suspect pulled him out of the car and punched him several times. He then got in the car and took off.

The suspect is described as a white male in his 20s, standing 6 feet tall and weighing about 150 pounds. The car was only described as a green Ford Focus.
