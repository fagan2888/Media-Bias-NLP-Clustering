Alex Wong/Getty Images\n\nGov. Chris Christie said Wednesday he supports limiting the number of candidates participating in the first Republican presidential primary debate.\n\nDuring a morning interview on \u201cFox and Friends,\u201d Mr. Christie said he backed Fox News\u2019s decision to limit the first GOP primary debate in August to the top 10 candidates based on standing in national polls.\n\nThe New Jersey governor, who currently would make the cut in the crowded 2016 field, is the first official or likely 2016 presidential contender to come out in favor of the debate restriction.\n\n\u201cI think you have got to have some sense of limit on it, because no one will have a chance to speak if you have too many people up there,\u201d Mr. Christie said.\n\nAsked to comment on several GOP hopefuls, Mr. Christie said he liked Sen. Marco Rubio and former Fla. Gov. Jeb Bush, and he has known Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker \u201cfor a long time.\u201d He said Carly Fiorina was \u201can important voice in this race.\u201d\n\nAnd he reiterated that he will announce a decision on whether he will run for president in June\n\nAlso Wednesday, Mr. Christie criticized the U.S. Senate for blocking reauthorization of the Patriot Act.\n\nA former U.S. attorney for New Jersey, Mr. Christie has sought to insert himself into the debate over the renewal of the Patriot Act and the National Security Agency\u2019s bulk telephone call data collection program. The law expires at the end of the month, and the Senate will resume debate over it on May 31.\n\nOn Saturday, Mr. Christie stated that the Senate\u2019s blocking of the reauthorization was \u201cthe unfortunate result of misguided ideologues who have no real world experience in fighting terrorism.\u201d\n\nHis potential 2016 rivals Sen. Rand Paul and Sen. Ted Cruz have criticized the NSA\u2019s metadata collection program.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Gov.
