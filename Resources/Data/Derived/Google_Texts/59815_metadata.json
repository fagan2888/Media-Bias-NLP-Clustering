Park space would take up 19% of the area, with most residents being within a two-minute walk of green space.\n\nCity administration's report states the development will generate profit for environmentally sustainable infrastructure and other municipal initiatives, providing a \"world-leading example of a sustainable neighbourhood.\"\n\nThe report emphasizes the need for balance between social, ecological and economic sustainability.\n\nThe first 10 years of redevelopment would be spent on removing airport infrastructure, as well as roadway design and construction, open space features, agriculture spots and seven hectares of stormwater management facilities.\n\nRecycling and reducing waste would be a priority during construction. Airport runways would be ground up and used for roads, and earth dug up for stormwater ponds would be used to make a hill.\n\nThe report also stresses the need to expand the LRT from the NAIT station to the two planned Blatchford stations.\n\nCouncil voted in 2009 to redevelop and close the city centre airport after heated debate, and approved a redevelopment plan in 2012 after design firm Perkins and Will was chosen via international competition.\n\nThe plan was scaled down in June to reduce costs, which had some calling the development \"watered down.\" The initial plan called for 25% park space and more high-rise buildings, as well as a pneumatic tube to transport garbage.\n\nThe $632 million would be funded through project revenues and borrowings of $81 million.\n\nThe airport closed for good in November 2013.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Edmonton Sun", "description": "City council will vote Wednesday on a plan to redevelop the former City Centre Airport land.", "title": "Plans for Edmonton City Centre Airport redevelopment put to vote", "url": "http://www.edmontonsun.com/2014/07/12/plans-for-edmonton-city-centre-airport-redevelopment-put-to-vote?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=recommend-button&utm_campaign=Plans for Edmonton City Centre Airport redevelopment put to vote", "image": "http://storage.edmontonsun.com/v1/dynamic_resize/sws_path/suns-prod-images/1297582852703_ORIGINAL.jpg?quality=80&size=100x", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 162622253780945}, "description": "City council will vote Wednesday on a plan to redevelop the former City Centre Airport land.", "robots": "NOODP,NOYDIR"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcd2b\"", "article_summary": "City council will vote Wednesday on a plan to redevelop the former City Centre Airport land.\nCouncil voted in 2009 to redevelop and close the city centre airport after heated debate, and approved a redevelopment plan in 2012 after design firm Perkins and Will was chosen via international competition.\nCity administration's report states the development will generate profit for environmentally sustainable infrastructure and other municipal initiatives, providing a \"world-leading example of a sustainable neighbourhood.\"\nAirport runways would be ground up and used for roads, and earth dug up for stormwater ponds would be used to make a hill.\nPark space would take up 19% of the area, with most residents being within a two-minute walk of green space."}
