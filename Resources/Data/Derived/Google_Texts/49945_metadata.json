If Republicans aren\u2019t careful, that may prove true.\n\nIn March, Obama adviser David Axelrod tweeted, \u201cThe email trap: If the Rs make HRC email an obsessive fixation, to the exclusion of larger concerns of people, they will pay a price. Again.\u201d\n\nThanks, Axelrod. An enemy multiplies kisses. After all, there are concerns about the economy, ObamaCare, immigration and what to do with a Supreme Court bent on making this nation ruled by a five-vote majority of a nine-judge panel. But Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails are the perfect profile of Machiavellian politics that she hopes lead to a Clinton White House 2.0.\n\nOn Tuesday, the State Department released 3,000 pages of Clinton\u2019s email from her time as secretary of state. This release is simultaneously huge and insignificant. Finally, after years of failed requests via the Freedom of Information Act, journalists and the public can start reading the email exchange showing Clinton telling retired four-star general John Podesta to \u201cplease wear socks to bed to keep your feet warm.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a massive document dump \u2014 3,000 pages of Clinton scheduling meetings, replying to intelligence reports or firing off curt replies. Yet, it\u2019s only a fraction of the 55,0000 pages of emails the State Department will release over the next few months. And it only happened because a federal judge ordered it after VICE News sued.\n\nWhen the State Department finishes, it will be January 2016 and well into presidential primary season \u2014 long enough to cause Hillary some heartburn, but also long enough to cause the public to tune out.\n\nUnfortunately, Clinton\u2019s lawyers got to the emails first. Steven Aftergood, director of the Project on Government Secrecy, notes the emails were \u201cheavily curated,\u201d and so there\u2019s a slim-to-none chance there will be \u201canything surprising or unexpected, let alone compromising.\u201d\n\nYet these pages reveal yet again Hillary\u2019s secrecy, dishonesty and incompetence. Here are three examples:\n\nSidney Blumenthal was more involved in her leadership than she previously disclosed. \u201cAre you still awake?\u201d Clinton wrote to Blumenthal in October 2009. \u201cI will call if you are.\u201d This email alone blows away Clinton\u2019s claim that Blumenthal sent her only unsolicited and un-vetted intelligence reports about Libya. While not serving in any official capacity, Blumenthal was an influential figure in Clinton\u2019s State Department. Blumenthal advised Clinton to stay mum on the issue of torture and he was an intermediary between Clinton and the Northern Ireland peace process. His involvement with Clinton\u2019s leadership team is a lot like a private email server \u2014 secret, no accountability and something Clinton alone can control. However convoluted the issue may seem, Hillary writhed away from transparency. Sending her lawyers to curate the emails? Printing out 55,000 pages of electronic communication and dumping it all on the State Department to re-digitize, vet and release? While Clinton may say she wants her emails out in the public, her actions don\u2019t match what she\u2019s saying. During their investigation into the Benghazi attack, the House Select Committee on Benghazi discovered that Blumenthal gave them 15 emails that were not in the pile Clinton handed to State. In other words, Clinton had been trimming emails that had to do with her involvement in Libya. Hillary struggles with attending meetings and operating fax machines. Honest question here for the \u201cmost qualified candidate ever to run for president.\u201d What is the prerequisite skills needed to become leader of the free world, commander in chief of America\u2019s Armed Forces? In the world of management, politics and communication, you\u2019d think sending a fax would be a necessary skill that\u2019s been around, oh, since at least the \u201890s. But there\u2019s Clinton in December 2009 emailing one of her staffers to ask about working the ol\u2019 faxer. And this was the woman who managed to operate a home-brewed email account. Furthermore, Clinton once heard about a cabinet meeting through listening to the radio (just like Barack Obama learns about every scandal on the news). \u201cCan I go?\u201d she wrote. \u201cIf not, who are we sending?\u201d These are mistakes you\u2019d expect an intern to make. But by all means, let\u2019s give her the keys to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue and the nuclear launch codes.\n\nThe issue running through all of this is Clinton\u2019s culture of ignoring rules and oversight, dodging transparency. And the State Department is implicated in this. The public wouldn\u2019t have known about Clinton\u2019s secret email server if it wasn\u2019t for the probing of the Benghazi committee.\n\nThe State Department has been dragging its feet since the committee asked for some of Clinton\u2019s emails last November. By March, the committee had to release a subpoena.\n\nDuring a press briefing June 26, State spokesman John Kirby told reporters, \u201cWe were in receipt of the email traffic that former Secretary Clinton provided, that she had gone through and decided were official in scope.\u201d\n\nHe also explained that the department had an \u201coriginal mandate,\u201d which was to get the email communication regarding the Benghazi attack, then Clinton\u2019s communication regarding Libya. But the record was incomplete, as at least 15 emails are missing from the State Department\u2019s records. Still, State will do nothing, even knowing that its record-keeping rules may have been violated. Kirby said he knows of no investigation and that it\u2019s \u201ca matter between the select committee and former Secretary Clinton.\u201d\n\nThe Left has been trying to make the Clinton emails and the original issue, the Benghazi attacks and cover-up, as big a political trap as they can for the Republican Party. Clinton has already created an attack ad over it. And the ranking Democrat member of the Benghazi Committee has been saying weekly that the investigation is only a partisan attack, and that the Republican House is wasting taxpayer money.\n\nBoth her secret servers and her Benghazi cover-up are critically important and, we think, disqualify Clinton from the Oval Office. Unfortunately, Clinton and the Democrats may succeed in dragging things out so long that these stories really are \u201cold news\u201d and voters will care even less than they do now. People expect the Clintons to be corrupt. So when corruption is exposed, they shrug and move on.", "article_metadata": {"description": "How this big scandal could actually work in Clinton's favor.", "csrf-token": "kbeacWcfr67axSiW8rAkUkL3v+7uen7a4iuP5OdtFpg=", "msapplication-TileColor": "#2b5797", "csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "og": {"site_name": "The Patriot Post", "description": "How this big scandal could actually work in Clinton\u2019s favor.", "title": "Hillary\u2019s Email Troubles Reach Beyond Benghazi", "url": "http://patriotpost.us/articles/36155", "image": "http://assets.patriotpost.us/images/2015-07-02-bcb2c5e8.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100002378661032, "app_id": 217327155053459}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/mstile-144x144.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbea2\"", "article_summary": "Government & Politics Hillary\u2019s Email Troubles Reach Beyond BenghaziThe Left sees the issue of Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails as a liability for the Right.\nOn Tuesday, the State Department released 3,000 pages of Clinton\u2019s email from her time as secretary of state.\nThe State Department has been dragging its feet since the committee asked for some of Clinton\u2019s emails last November.\nBut Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails are the perfect profile of Machiavellian politics that she hopes lead to a Clinton White House 2.0.\nWhile not serving in any official capacity, Blumenthal was an influential figure in Clinton\u2019s State Department."}
