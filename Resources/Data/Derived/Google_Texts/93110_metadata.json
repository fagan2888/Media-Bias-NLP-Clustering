Each purchase was scored on health based on the UK Food Standards Agency (FSA) criteria. Until now, there\u2019d only been anecdotal evidence regarding the impact supermarket price promotions have on people\u2019s diets, Theresa Marteau, director of the behavior and health research unit at the University of Cambridge, said in a press release.\n\nWhat Marteau and her team found were supermarkets no more frequently promote unhealthy foods than healthier foods. However, when price, discounts, and brand characteristics were taken into account, \u201cthe magnitude of the sales increase was larger in unhealthy foods than in healthier food categories.\u201d Specifically, a 10 percent increase in price promotions led to a 35 percent sales increase for unhealthy foods and only a 20 percent increase for healthier foods.\n\nIf there isn\u2019t much of a difference between how often unhealthy and healthy foods are promoted, why the sales boost? Researchers speculated it may have to do with the fact more of the foods in the unhealthy categories consist of non-perishable items, while healthier foods, such as fruits and vegetables, are perishable. In which case, consumers may be encouraged to stock up on non-perishable foods, so that they last long after the promotion.\n\nEconomic status also played a role in the study. Researchers found \"a higher socioeconomic status tended to respond to price promotions more than those from disadvantaged backgrounds, for both healthier and less healthy food.\"\n\n\"It seems to be a widely held idea that supermarkets offer promotions on less healthy foods more often than promotions on healthier foods, but we did not find this to be the case, except within a minority of food categories,\" said study author Dr. Ryota Nakamura, the Centre for Health Economics at the University of York in the UK. \"Yet, because price promotions lead to greater sales boosts when applied to less healthy foods, our results suggest that restricting price promotions on less healthy foods has the potential to make a difference to people's eating habits and encourage healthier, more nutritious diets.\"\n\nSource: Nakamura, R et al.
