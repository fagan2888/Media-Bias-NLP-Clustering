It aired last week.\"I may have lost my ability to travel,\" Snowden said during the interview. \"But I've gained the ability to go to sleep at night and to put my head on the pillow and feel comfortable that I've done the right thing, even when it was the hard thing. And I'm comfortable with that.\"Snowden reiterated his claims that he hoped to return to the United States eventually. \"I don't think there's ever been any question that I'd like to go home,\" he said. \"I mean, I've from day one said that I'm doing this to serve my country.\"Snowden, who claims he is a whistleblower and not a traitor, faces espionage charges when he steps back onto American soil.Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said on NBC News' \"Meet the Press\" on Sunday, \"His disclosures have damaged the security of this country, and I'm not going to get into a point-by-point inventory of the specifics of how he\u2019s done that.\"There is plenty of evidence he did damage to the security of this country.\"", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Edward Snowden, poll, NSA, surveillance", "pubdate": "2014-06-02T08:05:53", "og": {"site_name": "Newsmax", "description": "A majority of Americans oppose former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden's decision to leak thousands of damaging classified documents, according to a new poll.", "title": "NBC Poll: Most Americans Oppose Snowden's Spy Actions", "url": "http://www.newsmax.com/US/Edward-Snowden-poll-NSA-surveillance/2014/06/02/id/574540/", "type": "article", "image": "http://www.newsmax.com/CMSPages/GetFile.aspx?guid=2c879358-5271-46fb-906d-48b035b9d461&SiteName=Newsmax", "page_id": 85452072376}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.newsmax.com/US/Edward-Snowden-poll-NSA-surveillance/2014/06/02/id/574540/", "title": "NBC Poll: Most Americans Oppose Snowden's Spy Actions", "description": "A majority of Americans oppose former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden's decision to leak thousands of damaging classified documents, according to a new poll.", "site": "Newsmax"}, "fb": {"admins": 100002083767056, "app_id": 323020797885219}, "msvalidate.01": "FAF1322EC761685A5DD9344A1C19E82A", "epoch": 1401696353, "google-site-verification": "Jt2HUKgzJJw9VwIQJv31ETytuvNNm5ypTWN6j0nYvHM", "keywords": "Edward Snowden, poll, NSA, surveillance", "article": {"section": "US", "published_time": "2014-06-02T08:05:53"}, "original-source": "http://www.newsmax.com/US/Edward-Snowden-poll-NSA-surveillance/2014/06/02/id/574540/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "description": "A majority of Americans oppose former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden's decision to leak thousands of damaging classified documents, according to a new poll."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbdea\"", "article_summary": "\"I mean, I've from day one said that I'm doing this to serve my country.\n\"There is plenty of evidence he did damage to the security of this country.\"\n\"I may have lost my ability to travel,\" Snowden said during the interview.\n\"I don't think there's ever been any question that I'd like to go home,\" he said.\n\"Snowden reiterated his claims that he hoped to return to the United States eventually."}
