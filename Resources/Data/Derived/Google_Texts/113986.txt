Tours to space will be available for $150,000 to $200,000 in the next few years, says Don Thomas, a former NASA astronaut.

Space tourism will become increasingly affordable in the coming years as an unprecedented amount of capital gets channeled towards the sector, according to a former NASA astronaut.

"In a decade or two, going to space will be like going on an exotic vacation to Antarctica," said Don Thomas, who has traveled on four space shuttle missions during his 20-year career at NASA.

A look at accredited tour agencies such as G Adventures reveals prices to Antarctica start from $5,699 for an 11-day journey, excluding air fare.

"As more companies enter the space tourism business and as we develop new technologies, prices will come down," added Thomas, who is currently a physics professor at Towsen University.

That process is already underway.

A look at recent data indicates private investors are remarkably bullish on space tourism, which could result in the commercialization and development of cheaper technologies.
