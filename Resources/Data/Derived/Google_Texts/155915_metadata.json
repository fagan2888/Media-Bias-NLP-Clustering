He was the only candidate who alerted the public that money obtained to be used for low-income housing had been diverted for high-end condos and apartments.\n\nI also like his take on the Thomas Street fiasco. He also wants to direct more attention and funding toward citizens instead of corporations. I also favor his stand on ending the stranglehold the Chamber of Commerce has on the community.\n\nAs a kicker he wants to bring back Large Item Pickup Day. Many of the articles put out for pickup end up being used by our neighbors and friends.\n\nKronenwetter will be an energetic, intelligent mayor.\n\nLanore J.
