Lechner, Jr., told FoxNews.com. \u201cWithout proper attribution, political messages created by the Obama administration to support its political agenda are covert propaganda.\u201d\n\nThe videos, which the IG ultimately did not opt to investigate, offer testimonies from people who have had positive experiences getting health insurance after the passage of President Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act.\n\n\n\nWhile the videos originate from both the HHS and Center for Medicare and Medicaid Studies (CMS) platforms on YouTube, the watchdog group says there is no identifying mark on the videos themselves when they are embedded into other websites. The videos had been shared on a number of sites before the group complained, though many of those have since taken the video down.\n\n\n\nThe group says the department\u2019s actions violate federal laws that bar agencies from using public funds for \u201cpublicity or propaganda\u201d without specific congressional authorization.\n\n\n\nThe group also claims it is insufficient to just show the HealthCare.gov logo, since non-government groups like Democratic organizations have been known to do the same thing. The group\u2019s March letter to the OIG also complained that statements in the videos that include \u201cThe ACA is Working\u201d and \u201cMore Affordable\u201d are deceptive because they \u201cmisrepresent what the insurance companies in the marketplace actually promise and can deliver in terms of services.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe OIG was largely unmoved, telling Cause of Action in a May 2 letter, \u201cwe do not believe that OIG has sufficient grounds to undertake an investigation at this time.\u201d The OIG said \u201cwe are not aware of any evidence of HHS concealment of its role in the videos\u201d which it says is an important factor in determining if the videos fell under the category of covert propaganda.\n\n\n\n\u201c[W]hen these videos are on the HHS and CMS platforms, they are clearly attributed to HHS and CMS,\u201d the letter said.\n\nHowever, the office said they will recommend HHS \u201cconsider taking appropriate steps to ensure videos produced by HHS are clearly attributed even if transferred to another site.\u201d\n\n\n\nOn the question of the pro-ObamaCare statements included in the videos, the office said that to violate the prohibition on publicity or propaganda, the use of federal funds must be \u201ccompletely devoid of any connection with official functions\u201d -- and pointed to a 2010 ruling by the office that materials can contain some political content as the administration has authority \u201cto inform the public of its policies, to justify its policies and to rebut attacks on its policies.\u201d\n\nHHS told FoxNews.com that the videos were part of an effort to help Americans understand the law and the quality insurance available because of it.\n\n\"Those stories were posted on various platforms hosted by HHS. As our Office of Inspector General noted, HHS outreach efforts are clearly attributed to HHS, and we will continue to ensure this is the case,\u201d a spokesman said.\n\nAdam Shaw is a Politics Reporter for FoxNews.com.
