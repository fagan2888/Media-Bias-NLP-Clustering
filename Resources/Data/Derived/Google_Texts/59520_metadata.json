Jeff Merkley Jeff MerkleyHonor Frank Lautenberg by protecting our kids Dems discuss dropping Wasserman Schultz Sanders pans chemical safety reform deal MORE (D-Ore.) would deliver a blow to payday lenders that critics say charge dangerously high interest rates and fees on short-term loans.\n\nThe SAFE Act would block payday lenders from taking money out of borrowers\u2019 bank accounts without their permission through what is known as a \u201cremote check.\u201d It also targets a number of fees charged by payday lenders.\n\n\u201cThese payday loans pull families into a vortex of debt,\u201d Merkley told reporters.\n\n\u201cOnce they have the checking account number, they can reach in with checks they generate and take money out of a consumer\u2019s checking account at will,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s online, and it\u2019s very difficult to track these folks down and hold them accountable,\u201d he added.\n\nThe legislation also targets the prepaid cards that many payday lenders use to deliver the money to borrowers. Often times, these prepaid cards come with fees to look up the balance or even use the card, Merkley said.\n\nMerkley\u2019s bill would specifically prohibit overdraft fees on these cards and encourage federal regulators to crack down on some of the other fees.\n\nThe legislation has 10 co-sponsors, including Sens.
