If a person were to take foreign policy talking heads seriously, he might be left with the impression that Obama was grappling with yet another neocon mess. After five years of running the war, we were acting like it was 2008 and Obama bore absolutely no responsibility for the loss of life and treasure that accompanied his Afghanistan war strategy. (A strategy, incidentally, that we\u2019re now pretending was a success.)\n\nObama announced that he plans to end the broad U.S. military commitment in Afghanistan by 2016, leaving only\u2014only\u20149,800 American troops on the ground so that, one imagines, they can maintain some order. It\u2019s about time. But whatever your take is, the president\u2019s assertion that we can \u201cachieve the objectives that took us to war in the first place\u201d and can \u201cbegin a new chapter in the story of American leadership around the world\u201d is absurd.\n\nThe mention of a \u201cnew chapter\u201d intimates that the old chapter was thrust upon him. But who, exactly, was president five years ago? Or three years ago? Editorial boards seem to have forgotten that it was Obama who escalated our involvement soon after taking office, sending 30,000 additional military personnel there\u2014a nearly 50 percent jump. And troop levels did not peak in 2010, when the president was already talking about winding down the war, but in 2012, when more than 68,000 troops were in Afghanistan. Casualties spiked accordingly. Over 70 percent of the Afghan war\u2019s fatalities occurred under Obama\u2019s watch. How many Americans do you think are aware of that fact? None of the guests on the Sunday news shows seemed to think it worthy of mention.\n\nIf we use the benchmarks laid out by Obama, the surge was a failure. As The New York Times reported in 2012\u2014although the piece treats Obama like a bystander to unfolding events\u2014the surge was already being viewed as ineffective on the ground:\n\nThe American military says it has now fully withdrawn the last of the 33,000 \u2018surge troops\u2019 sent to pacify Afghanistan two years ago, but they are leaving behind an uncertain landscape of rising violence and political instability that threatens to undo considerable gains in security, particularly in the former Taliban strongholds in the south and southwest.\n\nIn the past two years, circumstances have not gotten better. We\u2019ve not achieved \u201cthe objectives that took us to war in the first place\u201d\u2014not the real ones, and not the administration\u2019s concocted ones.\n\nIn his West Point address, Obama boasted that hundreds of thousands of highly trained Afghan troops and policemen are now on the job. What he fails to mention is that those forces have been accused of widespread misconduct (including rape and child abuse) and are typically unable or unwilling to do anything about the rampant criminality, terrorism, and anarchy that plagues their nation. The president bragged that those Afghan forces have secured an election in \u201cwhich citizens voted for the first democratic transfer of power in their history.\u201d It\u2019s a democracy, Obama failed to note, that functions under a theocratic \u201cconstitution\u201d and recently passed laws that not only further subjugate women but basically undermine all the liberal tenets Obama says are our sacred duty to protect.\n\nUnder Obama (and under Bush before him) we aren\u2019t only enabling illiberalism, we are bankrolling a kleptocracy\u2014or as Obama might call it, \u201cempowering partners.\u201d The U.S. government has funneled tens of millions of dollars in cash to Hamid Karzai, who has, despite running this racket, constantly antagonized Western supporters. A recent reports by the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction found that there were billions more missing from the $63 billion the U.S. allocated for reconstruction. The money is gone, and one imagines it didn\u2019t find its way into the pockets of the local shopkeeper or construction worker.\n\nNot that more money has helped. A few month ago, a report for the Joint Chiefs of Staff concluded that Afghanistan\u2019s government was rooted in such a deep culture of corruption that is not only impervious to kindhearted American intervention but grew substantially worse the more we gave. According to the study, Washington helped ratchet up corruption by flooding Afghanistan with more cash than it could absorb through any legitimate channels or institutions.\n\nAnd through all the failures of Obama-led policies, it doesn\u2019t seem that our presence has helped diminish al-Qaeda\u2019s reach\u2014even in Afghanistan. According to a new State Department report, nearly 7,000 more people were killed in terrorist attacks worldwide in 2013 than in 2012, and most of them were killed by al-Qaeda or some other jihadi terrorist group.\n\nHow any of this meets American objectives\u2014either the idealistic ones or the realist ones\u2014is a mystery. That Obama can claim his Afghan strategy was a success without a tidal wave of criticism only indicates how much this administration gets away with.\n\nDemocrats have long portrayed Afghanistan as the good war that was forsaken to fight the unnecessary bad war in Iraq. So Obama focused on Afghanistan. Why is he getting a free ride after blowing it? Now, it would be partisan hackery to blame any single administration for the complex and multifaceted troubles that we face in that part of the world. Maybe there is no reform or military strategy that can live up to the quixotic objectives we set for ourselves or for them. But that doesn\u2019t mean Obama should be allowed to rewrite history or avoid culpability for his failures.", "article_metadata": {"item-publish-date": "Tue, 03 Jun 2014 07:27:06 EDT", "og": {"site_name": "The Federalist", "description": "Maybe no reform or military policy can reach our stated objectives in Afghanistan.
