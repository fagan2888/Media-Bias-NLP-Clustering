Democrats Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, Joe Donnelly of Indiana and Joe Manchin of West Virginia opposed him; all hail from red states where the gun lobby is particularly powerful.\n\nThe lack of 60 votes means Murthy quite likely would not have been confirmed had Democrats not amended the Senate\u2019s rules last November. That controversial change ultimately reduced the amount of support needed for executive branch nominees from 60 senators to 51 senators.\n\nMurthy\u2019s not the only person to benefit, of course. This year, the rules change helped the Senate push through Mel Watt, the director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, and up to 37 other nominations, according to a Senate Democratic aide. But for several months, Republicans widely used their \u201cno\u201d votes on cloture to register their disapproval of the Democrats\u2019 move. It\u2019s unknown whether they would have voted differently had the rule not been changed.\n\nPresident Barack Obama first nominated Murthy to be the nation\u2019s \u201ctop doctor\u201d in November 2013, several months after the position became vacant with the resignation of Regina Benjamin.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Tennessee tees up Medicaid expansion battle)\n\nMurthy will \u201cbring his lifetime of experience promoting public health to bear on priorities ranging from stopping new diseases to helping our kids grow up healthy and strong,\u201d Obama said in a statement after the confirmation vote. \u201cVivek will also help us build on the progress we\u2019ve made combating Ebola, both in our country and at its source.\u201d\n\nThe NRA had made Murthy a top target of opposition over several of his comments in support of gun control laws. Democrats, nervous about angering the gun lobby ahead of the midterm elections, shelved the nomination for much of this year.\n\n\u201cWe were running up against opposition from the gun groups, which of course has its influence on both sides of the aisle,\u201d said Sen. Dick Durbin, the majority whip.\n\nBut the vacancy became politically significant when West Africa\u2019s Ebola outbreak spread to the United States in September. Republicans criticized the White House for not having a qualified nominee for the job, while Democrats blamed the GOP for blocking Murthy amid an international health crisis.\n\nRepublicans have strongly opposed him not only because of his gun-control views but because of what they say are his lack of qualifications for the job and past political involvement. Murthy was the founder of Doctors for Obama, a group that backed the president\u2019s 2008 campaign.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: NRA stalls surgeon general pick)\n\n\u201cWith America facing the challenge of Ebola and other serious health challenges, it\u2019s unfortunate that the President chose a nominee based on the candidate\u2019s political support instead of a long career delivering patient care and managing difficult health crises,\u201d Republican Leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement.\n\nAnd Sen. Lamar Alexander, the top Republican on the Senate health committee, also noted his disappointment in a statement. \u201cUnfortunately, Dr. Murthy\u2019s experience does not demonstrate the leadership and knowledge of public health that we expect from our surgeons general,\u201d Alexander said.\n\nSen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), a physician, said on the Senate floor Monday that the majority of Murthy\u2019s career has been \u201cas an activist focused on gun control and political campaigns.\u201d America should have had an \u201cexperienced doctor in the job of surgeon general to lead our fight against Ebola,\u201d he said.\n\nAs for the Democrats who voted against him, Manchin said he questioned whether Murthy could separate his politics from the job. Heitkamp questioned whether he had enough health experience.\n\n\u201dThere are severe gaps in his basic qualifications that we as a country expect from our doctor of the nation \u2014 including experience in public health education training and management,\u201d Heitkamp said in a statement. \u201cDr. Murthy is a talented individual who I have no doubt has a promising career ahead of him.\u201d\n\nDonnelly called Murthy a talented physician but said he had \u201cconcerns about his ability to serve as our nation\u2019s leading medical voice on critical public health issues.\u201d\n\nMurthy\u2019s nomination was widely supported by public health groups, such as the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Public Health Association. Democrats praised him as an innovative thinker in health care, citing his creation of a community health partnership in rural India and an HIV/AIDS education program of volunteers in India and the United States.\n\nEducated at Harvard and Yale, Murthy is an internal medicine physician and educator at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital and Harvard Medical School.\n\nDuring his confirmation hearing in February, Murthy said that as surgeon general, he would focus on prevention and would try to reduce the nation\u2019s obesity rate, particularly among children.\n\nHe acknowledged why his role at Doctors for Obama \u2014 which was later renamed Doctors for America \u2014 generated opposition from Republicans.\n\n\u201cI recognize that some of the work that I\u2019ve done in Doctors for America, where we supported the ACA, can be perceived as partisan,\u201d Murthy said in his only mention of the politics of the group. \u201cI think it was unfortunate \u2014 and I think all of us believe this way \u2014 it was unfortunate that the discussion about health care became very partisan and it became polarized. In an ideal world, it wouldn\u2019t have been that way.\u201d\n\nThe reason he supported the health law \u201cwas not because it was perfect and it\u2019s not because we believed it would solve all of our health care problems,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it was because we did believe it would take some steps forward to addressing some difficulties we had seen as health care providers.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "Democrats confirmed him, 51-43.", "title": "Murthy confirmed as surgeon general", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/12/vivek-murthy-confirmed-surgeon-general-113584.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/12/15/141215_vivek_murthy_ap_6291.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Congress,Surgeon General,Senate,Vivek Murthy,NRA", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "Democrats confirmed him, 51-43.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1f83\"", "article_summary": "POLITICO Pro Murthy confirmed as surgeon generalThe Senate on Monday narrowly confirmed Vivek Murthy to be the nation\u2019s surgeon general, making him one of the highest-profile beneficiaries of the Senate\u2019s nuclear option.\nDuring his confirmation hearing in February, Murthy said that as surgeon general, he would focus on prevention and would try to reduce the nation\u2019s obesity rate, particularly among children.\nAnd Sen.
