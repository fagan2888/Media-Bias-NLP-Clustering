"I think most of you remember this. This is my brace from my scoliosis. I had to wear this 22 hours a day for two years. I was really nervous to wear it to school for the first time. But you were all so accepting. I remember Brooke (Harriman) asking in the locker room after gym one day what it was, and then asking to try it on. Everyone was so supportive and I can't tell you how much that meant to me," said Allen, the valedictorian and class president of Morristown's Class of 2015.
