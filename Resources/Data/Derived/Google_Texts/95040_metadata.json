That gives the uninsured a three-month window to comply with the Affordable Care Act\u2019s mandate for individuals to have health insurance by Jan. 1 or face penalties at tax time in April.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s frustrating that we are not going to be able to get a preview,\u201d said Jim Carnes, spokesman for Alabama Arise, a Montgomery-based organization that addresses issues affecting Alabama\u2019s poor. Because of that, Carnes predicts a slow start to people signing up.\n\nRELATED: Feds Warn \u2018Obamacare\u2019 Will Create New Scam Artists, Info Thieves\n\nThe Affordable Care Act calls for each state to have an insurance marketplace, either run by the state government or federal government, to help the uninsured find coverage. The federal government is creating the marketplace in Alabama because Gov. Robert Bentley is an opponent of the federal law and opted for Alabama not to participate. The marketplace is also referred to as an exchange.\n\nThe state Department of Insurance announced in May that the federal government had asked it to review plans submitted by Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Alabama and United Healthcare to cover people statewide and by Humana to cover 50 of Alabama\u2019s 67 counties.\n\nBlue Cross spokeswoman Koko Mackin said the company\u2019s products have received federal approval.\n\nUnited Healthcare spokesman Tyler Mason and Humana\u2019s Mitch Lubitz said the companies are awaiting final word.\n\nThe companies aren\u2019t giving any previews of their plans before the federal government discloses details Oct. 1.\n\nThe Census Bureau says one in eight Alabamians younger than 65, or 13.3 percent, lacked health insurance in 2012. The Department of Health and Human Services recently estimated 642,738 Alabamians were uninsured and would be eligible to buy coverage in the insurance marketplace.\n\nTo help people navigate the new offerings, the Department of Health and Human Services is providing more than $3 million to pay for assistance from Alabama organizations and health centers that serve the poor.\n\nRELATED: Study:\u2018Obamacare\u2019 Will Lead To Health Insurance \u2018Death Spiral\u2019\n\nAlabama\u2019s attorney general, who has fought the Affordable Care Act, is warning consumers to be on guard about the privacy of information they supply. \u201cThe various groups and agencies involved in Obamacare will have significant access to consumers\u2019 personal information. Yet HHS rules do not make clear provisions to protect the privacy of such information,\u201d Attorney General Luther Strange said in a letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Helen Sebelius.\n\nSebelius and others in the Obama administration began a high-level effort Wednesday to reassure Americans about the privacy and security of the information submitted under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nJohn Pickens, executive director of the Alabama Appleseed Center for Law and Justice in Montgomery, said it\u2019s critical for uninsured Alabamians to go to the new website (http://www.healthcare.gov) to look at the options in the Alabama marketplace. He said they can also plug in financial information that will tell them if they qualify for subsidies available for people with incomes less than 400 percent of the federal poverty level. For a family of four that is $94,200.\n\nHe said small businesses with fewer than 25 employees should also check out the website because they can get tax credits by purchasing employee coverage through the marketplace.\n\n\u201cThis is a historic time as it is the first time that no American will be turned down for health insurance because of a pre-existing health condition,\u201d he said.\n\n(\u00a9 Copyright 2013 The Associated Press.
