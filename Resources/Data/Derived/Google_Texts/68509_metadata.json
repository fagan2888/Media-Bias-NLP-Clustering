That\u2019s the conclusion from watching hearings in Annapolis over the exchange\u2019s proposed fiscal 2017 budget testimony last month. (Video of the House and Senate hearings is available online.)\n\nComplex operations\n\nThe exchange has a complex mission, with a large array of dissimilar business processes that management must harmonize for the sake of an arguably controversial public purpose -- expanding health insurance coverage in Maryland under Obamacare, as ACA has become known.\n\nGov. Hogan wants $122 million to run the exchange for fiscal 2017.\n\nThis budget is just for administration to run the exchange, and excludes big-ticket items like medical claims and administration costs borne by other state entities.\n\nThe exchange has 66 employees, but well over half its budget goes to contractors and grantees, who provide vital resources in every area and who manage a distinct \u201cbusy season\u201d when contractor rolls can swell to perhaps eight times the exchange\u2019s core size\u2014and dwindle as quickly as possible after open enrollment.\n\nThe exchange is a public entity with a mostly commercial mission. It\u2019s most important business partners are its customers, but operation of the exchange demands a heavy mix of technocratic business activity with several key departments in the state\u2019s sprawling health and social-service bureaucracy.\n\nAn exasperating partner, passive legislators\n\nThe exchange also partners with another entity that can be unfriendly, even ornery -- the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and its offshoots. Too often, HHS is the exchange\u2019s most exasperating business partner. That federal agency arguably caused many of the dislocations leading to the failure of the first health exchange website.\n\nKey management at the exchange seems to be doing a credible job. Indeed, the annual Department of Legislative Service (DLS) briefing prepared independently of the exchange described remarkable progress by the exchange in several areas.\n\nBut none of the above warrants a free pass in legislative hearings. After all, the exchange\u2019s adjusted fiscal 2017 budget is 23% higher than the cost estimate by Wakely Consulting in December 2012.\n\nLegislators during budget hearings have ample opportunities to ask critical questions if they do their homework. During last month\u2019s hearings, however, legislators missed several such opportunities.\n\nSince exchange operations are paid with federal Medicaid funding and an excise tax levied on health insurance, maybe the best posture is to avoid uncomfortable challenges because the exchange \u201cpays for itself.\u201d\n\nQuestions that need answers\n\nThe following questions are meant to show some of the areas that warranted answers during these hearings.\n\nSeveral other questions are apparent from the exchange\u2019s oral and written testimony, or from the DLS report. The exchange undoubtedly could provide reasonable answers in most cases and, having done so, would have earned their budget:\n\nToo successful at core mission -- enrolling the ineligible?\n\nWhat\u2019s the risk the exchange has been too successful at its core mission to enroll the uninsured? The exchange appears to have attained steady, strong progress to sign up customers, including Maryland\u2019s large population of difficult-to-reach uninsured people. Aggressive enrollments are the legal mandate.\n\nHowever, there\u2019s a big difference between aggressively enrolling the uninsured and controlling enrollments so they are limited to the eligible population of the uninsured. Many state exchanges are experiencing major difficulties with this distinction. What about Maryland?\n\nMinnesota's Obamacare health exchange has never been functionally capable of enrolling people according to the law. Auditors said many enrollees signed up via the state website (MNsure) last year might not have qualified, driving as much as $271 million in overpayments during a five-month period.\n\nSeveral other states have similar problems because their enrollment-related internal controls or computer systems can\u2019t distinguish eligible prospects from among the larger population of uninsured: New York, Vermont, Hawaii, Virginia. Audits in these states and others are reporting hundreds of millions of improper payments for medical claims due to errors originating with enrolling ineligible customers.\n\nStates must demonstrate to the federal government the accuracy of their Medicaid eligibility determinations. HHS has a substantial pilot program requiring state exchanges to self-test the accuracy of their eligibility determination.\n\nLegislators recognize every social-service program will have a certain degree of tolerable error. Is 3% of a $1 billion program -- $30 million -- tolerable?\n\nToo many ineligible beneficiaries?\n\nThe legislature\u2019s budget hearings should have included at least the following two questions:\n\nIs the exchange in jeopardy of enrolling too many ineligible beneficiaries?\n\nWill the exchange share its experience from its compliance with the federal program for self-testing its own enrollments? If the exchange is not participating in this program, why not?\n\nLegislators also should consider a pre-emptive audit similar to Minnesota to examine enrollment controls in the Maryland exchange.\n\nTrustees don\u2019t evaluate budget\n\nThe Board of Trustees doesn\u2019t evaluate or approve the Exchange\u2019s budget. Why not?\n\nThe Maryland Health Benefit Exchange Act of 2011 requires the Board of Trustees to \"Ensure [the exchange's] sound operation and fiscal solvency\u2026.\" and stipulates the board\u2019s members must act in a manner consistent with a \"...prudent person in a like position in similar circumstances.\"\n\nThe board, however, neither evaluates nor approves the exchange\u2019s annual budgets or its budget overruns (deficiency appropriations). Legislators should have asked the exchange why its board isn\u2019t involved with exchange budgets.\n\nTrue state of the website\n\nWhat\u2019s the true state of the Connecticut-built website re-purposed by the Maryland exchange? What are its economic and financial costs compared to alternatives?\n\nThe Connecticut website put in service by the Maryland exchange in an expeditious manner in 2014, is considerably short of the functionality the O\u2019Malley administration promised the legislature and everybody else. The re-purposed application was re-named HBX, an acronym that stands for the exchange eligibility system.\n\nIn a December 2015 report to the legislature, Integrated Eligibility Services: \u201cOne Door\u201d described \u201cfractured\u201d enrollment processes in the wake of HBX\u2019s hasty implementation creating waste, unneeded burdens on state resources and hardship on those needing state assistance.\n\nThis report was not comprehensive because it didn\u2019t reflect any collaboration with three other stakeholder agencies, DHMH, the Maryland Department of Human Resources (DHR) and Department of Information Technology. It was not current because much of the information in the report was known a year or more ago.\n\nNow would be a good time to revisit the \u201cBusiness Requirements\u201d envisioned in the original exchange website\u2019s specs, to identify any opportunities for improving current functions of the HBX application.\n\nThe window for generous federal funding (up to 90%) for enhancing information technology will close after two years. A reliable cost-benefit analysis is overdue, and could help with aligning stakeholders about the scope of a better health exchange website.\n\nLegislators should have asked for a comprehensive and current report during the hearing or the legislature should require the exchange to prepare a responsive report, to include the true cost and funding source for an adequate website having a functional fit with Maryland\u2019s needs.\n\nAsking for a waiver\n\nWhy would the exchange ask HHS for a waiver from the requirement to prepare revenue and expense statements and get them audited annually? What\u2019s the status?\n\nThe exchange is required by federal regulations to prepare a financial statement showing receipts and disbursements for each plan year (ending December 31). A recent outside audit required by HHS found the exchange failed to comply.\n\nWorse, the exchange disagreed with the audit and indicated it shouldn\u2019t need to comply because its financial information is covered in the statewide audit, and its budget submissions capture all the information needed to assure integrity of operations. Statewide financial statements, audits, and budget submissions are prepared on the basis of the state\u2019s fiscal year ending June 30, so this information is incompatible with the HHS requirement for plan year audits. For this reason and others, the exchange\u2019s rationale for being excluded from the HHS requirement is weak, and reflects poorly on its understanding of the federal integrity requirement.\n\nThe DLS was unaware of this audit, although legislators might have discovered it simply by browsing the exchange\u2019s website. The subject wasn\u2019t discussed at either hearing. Legislators should have asked the exchange to justify its departure from federal integrity requirements.\n\nIdentifying cost savings\n\nCumulative spending for the call center and \u201cConnector Entities\u201d is about $200 million in the first enrollment periods. What are the top three opportunities for cost savings?\n\nLegislators should have asked detailed questions, particularly about call-center costs. The call center contract, for example, is a cost reimbursable type--one where the government, not the contractor, bears significant risk of performance.\n\nSketchy enrollment data\n\nEnrollment data seems sketchy. Is that because the data are unavailable, too hard to capture, or simply not reported?\n\nThe exchange reports enrollment data in what might be characterized to be within self-serving boundaries. Since the exchange testifies as advocates for their budget, puffery about their performance is natural and proper. If the exchange doesn\u2019t present a balanced picture, however, legislators can\u2019t objectively evaluate the budget. So the exchange should be reporting many more enrollment statistics if reliable data can be captured even if it takes cooperation from carriers.\n\nCharlie Hayward spent more than 30 years performing Government Accountability Office audits and served as a partner in two accounting firms.
