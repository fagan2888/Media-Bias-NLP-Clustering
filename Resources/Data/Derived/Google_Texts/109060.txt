Stop gouging us, Florida House; expand Medicaid and cover the poor

It's bad enough that you pay for your own health insurance while also covering the unpaid hospital bills for the poor. In Florida, the pain is worse than that.

By rejecting an expansion of Medicaid, the House of Representatives is standing guard over a broken system that forces you to pay twice to care for the working poor:

We urge House leaders including Speaker Steve Crisafulli, R-Merritt Island, and Ritch Workman, R-Melbourne, to stop the gouging. With time running out in the Legislative session, they should at least open negotiations with the Senate on a plan it passed to accept Medicaid dollars and enroll the poor in privatized managed-care plans.

Medicaid expansion a prescription for disaster

In Tallahassee, the issue of Medicaid expansion is quickly becoming one of the most important and contentious of the current legislative session. An interesting dynamic in this debate is that the Florida House and Senate, both controlled by a super-majority of Republicans, are completely opposed to each other.

Health experts: Let Medicaid help Brevard

Expanding Medicaid in Florida would mean $114 million annually for Brevard County and would cover thousands here who currently have no health insurance, said health care experts at a forum Wednesday.

Guest column: Don't compound bad Medicaid policy

Every time I hear someone discuss Medicaid expansion in Florida, I harken back to that promise I made and how disingenuous it ended up being. No matter how much I meant it at the time, reality proved otherwise.

The News-Press

Editorial: Medicaid plan worth a listen for Legislature

It is a plan being pushed by Sen. Bill Nelson and one that is supported by Lee Memorial Health System President and CEO Jim Nathan. It is a plan that could work if state Republican and Democratic leaders are willing to drop their political gloves and at least listen.

Medicaid Expansion: Just Take the Dang Horse!

Florida's large number of uninsured adults is a serious issue because it can lead to dangerous medical conditions, financial strain, and an estimated three to six deaths per day. Good preventive care can catch and treat life-threatening conditions and manage chronic illnesses. There are 800,000 Florida residents who are in the insurance "coverage gap.''

Medicaid expansion wrong for Florida

There's an old saying that a pig with lipstick is still a pig. So it is with the Affordable Care Act's Medicaid expansion in the Sunshine State, which was unveiled in recent weeks as the so-called "A Healthy Florida Works" plan.

Pensacola News Journal

Viewpoint: Fix our health care

Last week, Sen. Greg Evers, R-Baker, and all of the Florida Senate demonstrated true leadership when they passed a budget that included a comprehensive health care package designed to address the state's worsening health care crisis.

Viewpoint: An alternative to Medicaid expansion

Doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results is, in the words of Einstein, the definition of insanity. Unfortunately for Floridians, so too are the calls today to expand our state's Medicaid system under the Affordable Care Act.

Tallahassee Democrat

Senate plan for Medicaid, FHIX sound

Last week, the Florida House and Senate issued proposed budgets that are billions of dollars apart. The difference revolves around their positions on the funding of our Medicaid program. Unless resolved, the Medicaid impasse will undo the entire state budget. Our state is facing a crisis and thankfully our leaders in the Senate are putting forth a solid plan to address it.

Dockery: Call it what you want, it's still Medicaid expansion

Two years ago, as part of the Affordable Care Act, Florida was offered $50 billion over 10 years to expand Medicaid to those low-income families who didn't qualify under the current eligibility requirements. The governor and the Florida Legislature turned it down.

Dancing on graves of poor people

Florida Times-Union -- Jacksonville

Scott, speaker must focus on people - not politics

Florida's leaders are playing politics with health care.
