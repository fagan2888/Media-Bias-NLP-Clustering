Wharton of Memphis, Tenn.\n\nJarrett outlined the \u201cfinal coordinated push\u201d to enroll blacks in ObamaCare, and said the administration would be working with youth organizers and stakeholders to launch enrollment events targeting black youths in the coming weeks.\n\nA similar effort launched this week aimed at Hispanics.\n\nOn Monday, the administration launched a Latino Enrollment Week of Action aimed at educating Hispanics about the merits of getting coverage. The federal government is partnering with local leaders and activist groups for summits in Dallas, Atlanta, Tampa Bay, Chicago and Philadelphia to get the word out.\n\nThe Obama administration has said there are 8 million uninsured Hispanics eligible for ObamaCare in the country However, data coming out of the California healthcare exchange suggests the group has been slow to enroll.\n\nThe administration has been criticized for the long delay in releasing the Spanish-language ObamaCare website, CuidadoDeSalud.gov, and some have said the final product was sloppy.\n\nBut on Monday, HHS director Mayra Alvarez said the administration was \u201credoubling\u201d its efforts to enroll Hispanics, and \u201cengaging in an ambitious outreach program.\u201d\n\nShe touted the improved CuidadoDeSalud.gov, which she said now offers a more robust shopping experience, and noted the administration\u2019s success in reaching Hispanics consumers through partnerships with Spanish-language media.\n\nAdministration officials and local leaders say there are unique challenges to getting blacks and Hispanics on board with the healthcare law.\n\nWharton said one of the barriers to enrollment in his poverty-stricken city of Memphis is that the poor have become so reliant on free emergency room services that any cash outlay for insurance, no matter how cheap, would be a sticker shock for some of his citizens.\n\nAnd the administration said many Hispanics may be wary about enrolling in a federal program because they live in a \u201cmixed family,\u201d and fear it may expose their undocumented relatives. Hispanics also worry about the costs being prohibitive, and the administration is trying to get the word out that 80 percent of those uninsured likely qualify for a federal subsidy.\n\nA White House official told The Hill on Monday that the push for minorities was not new, that the goal had always been to reach out to different ages, genders, races and geographic areas.\n\nStill, those efforts are particularly visible five-weeks out from the March 31 enrollment deadline.\n\nFederal health officials face a tough task in reaching their goal of 7 million sign-ups by March 31.Through January, only 3.3 million had signed up, and the administration needs a strong number of healthy consumers, who skew younger, for the law to perform optimally.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The administration is pushing to increase minority sign-ups ahead of the 2014 deadline.", "description": "The administration is pushing to increase minority sign-ups ahead of the 2014 deadline.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Jonathan Easley", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The administration is pushing to increase minority sign-ups ahead of the 2014 deadline.", "title": "Final ObamaCare push targets blacks, Hispanics", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/199166-final-obamacare-push-targets-blacks-hispanics", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/blogs/obamacare_121113getty_0.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-02T12:18:14-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-02T12:18-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/199166-final-obamacare-push-targets-blacks-hispanics", "dcterms.date": "2014-02-25T11:52-05:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Dustin Weaver", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",Kathleen Sebelius,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-25T11:52:56-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-02T12:18:14-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/199166-final-obamacare-push-targets-blacks-hispanics", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The administration is pushing to increase minority sign-ups ahead of the 2014 deadline.", "card": "summary", "title": "Final ObamaCare push targets blacks, Hispanics"}, "dcterms.title": "Final ObamaCare push targets blacks, Hispanics"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8661\"", "article_summary": "The Obama administration is beginning a coordinated, community-based effort to enroll blacks and Hispanics in ObamaCare before the final deadline for 2014.\nAdministration officials and local leaders say there are unique challenges to getting blacks and Hispanics on board with the healthcare law.\nOn Monday, the administration launched a Latino Enrollment Week of Action aimed at educating Hispanics about the merits of getting coverage.\nThe Obama administration has said there are 8 million uninsured Hispanics eligible for ObamaCare in the country However, data coming out of the California healthcare exchange suggests the group has been slow to enroll.\nThe administration has been criticized for the long delay in releasing the Spanish-language ObamaCare website, CuidadoDeSalud.gov, and some have said the final product was sloppy."}
