The king of political comedy, Maher stops by Cincinnati for a stand-up show Sunday just as his HBO show, Real Time with Bill Maher, returns from summer hiatus Friday. Busy with touring and hosting an Emmy-nominated weekly talk show, he won\u2019t be making another documentary like 2008\u2019s Religulous anytime soon.\n\n\u201cNo, no,\u201d Maher says when asked if he\u2019d have another go at the doc world. \u201cThat was a one-time thing. I had been talking about the issue of religion for the longest time on TV. I thought it deserved a bigger canvas unlike any other issue. I knew no one else would cover it. Michael Moore is the guy who does great documentaries and he can have it. I am not in competition with Michael Moore \u2014 he owns that. He is so great at it. But this was the one issue I knew he would never do \u2014 he\u2019s Catholic. \u2026 That was my Moby Dick, and having harpooned it, I\u2019m done.\u201d\n\nKnown today for his no-holds-barred commentary on current events, politics and religion, Maher has always been a stand-up comic and he got his start honing his chops in comedy clubs in 1979 \u2014 long before the days when performers utilized social media to spread their messages or work. And as with many performers, Facebook and Twitter have proven to be helpful tools for Maher as a contemporary comedian.\n\n\u201cWhen you are travelling, especially as much as I do, and trying to get people aware that you\u2019re in the city, at the theater, it\u2019s fantastic,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cI remember the old days when you had to get up and go to the radio station in the morning,\u201d Maher continues. \u201cI\u2019m not a morning person. And this was when the disc jockeys were mean to you. So at 8 a.m. you\u2019re talking to some guy who\u2019s giving you shit at that hour of the day. So this Twitter is great.\u201d\n\nOf course, the Twittersphere can also quickly turn into a toxic wasteland of hate, especially for an outspoken public figure like Maher.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s literally depressing to think that there are that many people out there whose lives revolve around just saying some shit.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just me \u2014 it\u2019s everybody. The most non-confrontational people get the same kind of shit. I could say, \u2018Good morning,\u2019 on Twitter and in 10 seconds there\u2019d be three people saying, \u2018Fuck you, Bill Maher. Where do you get off saying \u2018morning?\u2019 Morning is owned by Ronald Reagan!\u2019 \u201d\n\nBut Maher does like to get feedback from fans who aren\u2019t complete assholes. So, in times of Twitter turmoil, he takes the advice of his buddy, the aforementioned Michael Moore: \u201cHe said, \u2018After you write something on Twitter, wait 10 minutes. Because all the haters wanna get on it immediately.\u2019 They want to be the first ones to be seen. So if you just wait 10 minutes, it\u2019s like all that shit washes away and then you can actually read comments from sane people.\u201d\n\nInteracting with people and offering commentary is what Maher does best, and it\u2019s the basis of Real Time as well as the show that catapulted him into the spotlight 20 years ago \u2014 Politically Incorrect. Maher hosted the late night talk show on Comedy Central from 1993-1997 and on ABC from 1997-2002. On the popular, award-winning show, Maher entertained an array of guests from celebrities and fellow comedians to political figures and journalists to discuss current events of Maher\u2019s choosing. Real Time maintains the same monologue and guest panel format, but features more political dialogue.\n\nIf Maher could arrange his dream Real Time panel, he says it would consist of author and journalist Christopher Hitchens (who passed away in 2011), a comedian like Martin Short and a guest who has never appeared on the show before \u2014 Bill Clinton.\n\n\u201cOr Hillary Clinton,\u201d Maher says. \u201cOr Chelsea Clinton. Any Clinton! The Clintons are always avoiding me and I don\u2019t know why.\u201d\n\nMaher and his panel take on a range of hot-button subjects every week, from stop-and-frisk to LGBT rights to Obamacare or whatever current headlines are in the news. One issue he\u2019s remained vocal in supporting is the legalization of marijuana.\n\n\u201cThe thing you have to remember about marijuana is that it is the one issue that unites red and blue states,\u201d Maher says. \u201cHillbillies smoke marijuana and hippies smoke marijuana \u2014 everybody likes pot.\u201d\n\nMaher says he\u2019s much more optimistic about the future of marijuana laws than he was just a few years ago, now that pot is legal in Colorado and Washington state and medical marijuana is legal in 17 additional states plus Washington, D.C. What disappoints him is how Democrats in office go about supporting the issue.\n\n\u201cThe problem is with so many of these liberal issues, the Progressive Party, the Democratic Party, lacks balls,\u201d Maher says, with a smack of his signature snark. \u201cLook at the way they didn\u2019t come around on gay marriage until it was actually overwhelmingly popular with the American people. They don\u2019t lead \u2014 they follow. As soon as gay marriage passed 51 percent in approval ratings, suddenly there were all these democratic politicians who were \u2018evolving\u2019 on the issue. They suddenly evolved rather quickly! Well, what I would say to them right now is that marijuana legalization, on a national level, is at 47 percent approval. So you\u2019re only four points from a strongly held conviction! Get on the train early!\u201d\n\nFans can expect Maher to weigh in on these and all the topics one should never discuss in polite company (you know, sex, politics, religion) during Sunday\u2019s show.\n\n\u201cI take the funniest stuff, the stuff that is most telling about the most issues and I try to pack it into 90 minutes to two hours and go out there and just give them a really great, well-produced stand-up show,\u201d Maher says.\n\n\u201cThere are different levels of how real you can get,\u201d Maher says of performing. \u201cThere are things I can say on HBO that I can\u2019t say on Jay Leno, but there are things I can say in my stand-up act that I would never say even on HBO. It\u2019s just a more real, raw performance.\u201d\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "Bill Maher knows his niche.
