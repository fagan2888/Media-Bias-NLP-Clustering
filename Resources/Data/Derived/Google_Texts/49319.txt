SANAA, Yemen (AP) — The International Committee of the Red Cross says a plane loaded with badly needed aid has landed in Yemen’s rebel-held capital.

Photos posted on the organization’s official Twitter account show aid workers unloading the supplies Saturday. The group says the shipment consists of more than 35 tons of medical aid, generators and emergency sanitation equipment.

The first such delivery to the capital since a Saudi-led air coalition began airstrikes against the Houthi rebels more than two weeks ago landed on Friday. Saturday’s shipment is more than double the size of the first.

Aid groups say they are struggling to cope with the rising casualty numbers and shrinking food and fuel supplies.

A smaller aid delivery arrived in the southern port city of Aden by boat earlier this week.
