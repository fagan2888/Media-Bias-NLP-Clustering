LITTLE ROCK — Former U.S. Sen. Tim Hutchinson is endorsing Florida Sen. Marco Rubio for president, taking a different position from that of his brother, Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson.

Asa Hutchinson has endorsed former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee’s campaign. Tim Hutchinson said this week in a statement issued by the Rubio campaign that Rubio is “the leader our nation needs to reverse the failed liberal policies of the past eight years.”

“A man of faith and vision, Marco is a staunch conservative who knows what it takes to unleash the American spirit,” Tim Hutchinson said. “Under Marco’s leadership, working families will be uplifted as he lowers taxes, repeals Obamacare and rolls back onerous regulations that are standing in the way of growth and opportunity. Marco lived the American dream, and he’ll ensure that each and every one of us has a shot at doing the same.”

The former senator said in an email Tuesday, “I would only add that I have followed his career, I have gotten to know him, I have observed his effectiveness in the Senate and am convinced that he is the conservative leader we need to serve as our next president.”

Tim Hutchinson served in the U.S. House from 1993 to 1997 and the U.S. Senate from 1997 to 2003.
