Around it, activists and advocates milled about handing out literature, collecting petition signatures and attempting to build the ranks of people fighting to secure access to abortion for low-income women. Ad Policy\n\nThe bus, which began its national tour in Los Angeles this month, and the coalition behind it are part of the latest effort to repeal the Hyde Amendment, which for nearly four decades has banned the use of federal funds for abortion and limited the options available women who depend on Medicaid for their healthcare coverage.\n\nThe ban\u2019s real intent\u2014reversing Roe v. Wade to the greatest extent possible\u2014has been clear from the beginning. After the budget amendment\u2019s passage in 1976, Republican Representative Henry Hyde said, \u201cI certainly would like to prevent, if I could legally, anybody having an abortion, a rich woman, a middle-class woman, or a poor woman. Unfortunately, the only vehicle available is the\u2026Medicaid bill.\u201d\n\nAdvocates for poor women and women of color have been trying to repeal the Hyde Amendment ever since, arguing that a person\u2019s income level shouldn\u2019t dictate her decision whether to become a parent. Currently, about 9 million women of reproductive age are Medicaid beneficiaries, and advocates use that number to quantify how many are denied access to abortion. Using a bus tour with stops in cities including Chicago, Philadelphia and Washington, DC, and a social media campaign, the fifty-plus organizations that make up the coalition want to push a conversation about Hyde into mainstream conversations about abortion rights and eventually into the halls of Congress.\n\nLegislative pushes for repeal have failed in the past, since even Democrats who are otherwise in favor of abortion rights have been unwilling to challenge anti-choice framing that\u2019s put \u201ctaxpayer-funded abortion\u201d out of bounds. That\u2019s why a central goal this campaign is to mobilize elected officials who lead on issues of choice but who rarely talk about the need to repeal Hyde, Kalpana Krishnamurthy, policy director at a supporting organization called Forward Together, told me.\n\n\u201cThe Hyde Amendment has never been a rigorous part of the pro-choice agenda,\u201d Krishnamurthy said. \u201cWe want to make sure that our friends and allies know that it\u2019s a new day and it\u2019s time to take this on.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a new day in part because of the Affordable Care Act and the opportunity it has created through Medicaid expansion for more women and families to access healthcare. (In addition to advocating for Hyde\u2019s repeal, campaign participants are also calling on states to repeal bans on abortion coverage in the healthcare exchanges set up under the ACA.) But the time also feels right because a new generation is bumping up against the challenge of not having employer-based insurance coverage, and so finding itself susceptible to restrictions on abortion coverage. That\u2019s why the bus, with its neon-green lettering and exhortations to \u201cbe bold\u201d and \u201cbe brave,\u201d strives to have a youthful appeal. At the stop in Oakland, people who gathered were encouraged to take photos of themselves expressing support and share them on social media using one of the campaign\u2019s hashtags. The formal part of the program\u2014during which Representative Barbara Lee told the crowd, \u201cIt\u2019s the street heat that\u2019s going to matter\u201d on repealing Hyde\u2014opened with the reading of stories about individuals\u2019 struggles to raise the money for their abortions.\n\n\u201cThe tactics matter, and the tactics speak to a new generation,\u201d Krishnamurthy said. Another of those tactics involves gathering petition signatures for local initiatives along the way and bringing those supporters into a conversation about Hyde. So in California, advocates also circulated a petition in support of a paid sick leave bill.\n\nCalifornia, one of seventeen states that use their own funds to cover abortion for people on Medicaid, is the right place to draw the connection to the myriad pressures facing poor families. Women there still struggle to pay for childcare, travel or a place to stay when they make the decision to have an abortion.\n\n\u201cThe funds for the actual abortion is a start,\u201d Poonam Dreyfus-Pai told me. She serves on the board of ACCESS, an Oakland-based hotline that provides Californians with reproductive health information.\n\nIt\u2019s time for legislators to start talking about the exclusion that low-income families have faced for decades, Dreyfus-Pai said. \u201cRoe does not mean as much with Hyde in place.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/be_bold_road_trip_otu_img-275x173.jpg", "sailthru.author": "Dani McClain", "description": "Advocates behind a national bus tour want to enlist young people in the fight to repeal the Hyde Amendment.", "generator": "WooCommerce 2.3.13", "og": {"site_name": "The Nation", "description": "Advocates behind a national bus tour want to enlist young people in the fight to repeal the Hyde Amendment.", "title": "Why 2014 Is the Year to Demand Medicaid-Funded Abortions", "url": "http://www.thenation.com/article/why-2014-year-demand-medicaid-funded-abortions/", "image": {"width": 1500, "identifier": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/be_bold_road_trip_otu_img.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 975}, "updated_time": "2015-06-29T08:27:22+00:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Advocates behind a national bus tour want to enlist young people in the fight to repeal the Hyde Amendment.", "title": "Why 2014 Is the Year to Demand Medicaid-Funded Abortions", "url": "http://www.thenation.com/article/why-2014-year-demand-medicaid-funded-abortions/", "image": {"src": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/be_bold_road_trip_otu_img.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/be_bold_road_trip_otu_img-1440x756.jpg", "width": 1500, "height": 975}, "site": "@TheNation", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "August 27th, 2014", "sailthru.title": "Why 2014 Is the Year to Demand Medicaid-Funded Abortions", "sailthru.tags": "Feminism,Gender and Sexuality,Reproductive Rights,Science and Health,Blog", "fb": {"app_id": 192399944158735}, "sailthru.content_id": 112555, "keywords": "blog, feminism, gender and sexuality, reproductive rights, science and health", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheNationMagazine", "tag": "science and health", "published_time": "2014-08-27T21:26:29+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-29T08:27:22+00:00", "author": "http://www.thenation.com/author/dmcclain/"}, "sailthru.description": "Advocates behind a national bus tour want to enlist young people in the fight to repeal the Hyde Amendment.", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/be_bold_road_trip_otu_img-680x430.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "On a sunny Wednesday afternoon in August, the All Above All tour bus parked in a busy plaza in the heart of downtown Oakland, California.\nCurrently, about 9 million women of reproductive age are Medicaid beneficiaries, and advocates use that number to quantify how many are denied access to abortion.\nThat\u2019s why the bus, with its neon-green lettering and exhortations to \u201cbe bold\u201d and \u201cbe brave,\u201d strives to have a youthful appeal.\nIt\u2019s time for legislators to start talking about the exclusion that low-income families have faced for decades, Dreyfus-Pai said.\nThe ban\u2019s real intent\u2014reversing Roe v.
