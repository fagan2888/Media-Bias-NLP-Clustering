People don\u2019t like shooting zombies 10 times only to see them continue walking, paint-covered, toward their trailer. It\u2019s disappointing.\n\nSo staying down until the trailer carries on to its next stop is a rule Aj Herren plans to enforce this year at Millers Thrillers Zombie Paintball Hayride.\n\nThe Spring Hill resident started working at the family-themed haunted woods last year \u2014 the first for zombie paintball \u2014 and could hear the exasperated comments from shooters in the trailers that drove the grounds.\n\n\u201cDying is the funnest part of being a zombie,\u201d Herren said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re running full speed at the trailers and you get shot in the head, people get so excited.\u201d\n\nHerren and Gavin Blackhurst, who has worked at Millers Thrillers for four years, led a group of interested employees and volunteers through the paintball section Saturday afternoon as part of the attraction\u2019s auditions.\n\nMore than 40 people showed up to hear about the haunted woods and zombie hayride and consider applying for a role in the events. The group, consisting mostly of teens, wasn\u2019t aware the auditions began when they stepped foot on the property.\n\nDuring the day, five managers in the crowd watched the group to see how individuals acted, especially with other people, said Michael Oakley, who\u2019s worked at Millers Thrillers for four years, helping plan the entertainment aspects of the events.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking at how they interact with each other,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re more a family than we are a business.\u201d\n\nOakley, Blackhurst and David Miller, the attraction\u2019s creator, led small groups through sections of the haunted woods and hayride Saturday to allow people to see where they could work or volunteer.\n\nAs Miller showed the beginning of the haunted woods, he frequently disappeared through hidden passageways and behind curtains, popping up unexpectedly at the front of the group.\n\nA participant of the tour said the passageways allowed managers to travel the grounds quickly if needed.\n\nAt one stop, Miller showed the group where one person would stand behind a fence, rattling it to scare people.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll put a chain on the fence so they\u2019ll think it\u2019s the chain, but really it\u2019s just jingle bells,\u201d Miller said, pointing to a line of white bells. \u201cAhh, jingle bells.\u201d\n\nMillers Thrillers needs at least 80 people to pull off the attractions held during 15 days between September and November, Miller said.\n\nSome of the jobs sounded intriguing \u2014 you can be a dummy on the bridge, a party room tree stalker or a graveyard statue \u2014 while others seemed questionable.\n\nMaking loud noises and swinging dummies at terrified guests could be a blast, sure. But why would anyone volunteer to be shot at with paintballs?\n\nAshley Netterville of Spring Hill said being a zombie in the hayride allowed her to get out of her own body and become a completely new person \u2014 even if it was a dead one. She worked in the paintball fields last year in \u201cthe pit\u201d and said she had fun.\n\nThe pit is a ditch that zombies crawl out of toward the 20 guests shooting paintballs at them from a paused trailer. Netterville said she tripped numerous times as she attempted to get out of the ditch, but she could pretend she had died, so it was fine.\n\n\u201cI decided, if it works, it works,\u201d she said.\n\nChris Pittenger, 18, of Thompson\u2019s Station, said he wants to participate in the paintball hayride this year. He\u2019s seen every zombie movie \u2014 yes, all of them \u2014 and shot at the zombies from the ride last year. Now, he wants to see the action from the other side.\n\n\u201cTo be a zombie would be a dream come true,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Once you're dead \u2014 stay dead.
