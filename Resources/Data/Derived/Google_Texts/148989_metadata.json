In college, he was editor-in-chief of the Dartmouth Review, and through his time there received an internship, and even\u00adtually a job, at WSJ in 2005. Rago won the 2011 Pulitzer Prize in Edi\u00adtorial Writing for his work on the Affordable Care Act. Winning the Pulitzer Prize at 28 made Rago one of the youngest writers ever to receive the honor.\n\nHow did you win your Pulitzer Prize at such a young age?\n\nIt\u2019s kind of like getting into college: Everyone is qualified. Your editor picks out 10 pieces of writing you\u2019ve done that year and submits that work to a jury of three people, who choose three writers in each of the 16 cat\u00ade\u00adgories. The writing from those three writers then goes before the full Pulitzer Board. I won in 2011 for the edi\u00adtorial writing I did in 2010. It doesn\u2019t sound very intrepid, but it\u2019s sort of random.\n\nAt the time you were writing on Oba\u00admacare, did you see the importance of the topic?\n\nIf you\u2019re a jour\u00adnalist, the Affordable Care Act was a kind of winning powerball ticket. The gravity of the writing came from the subject, not the edi\u00adtorials them\u00adselves. The economy has totally col\u00adlapsed and Wash\u00adington is going off on healthcare. So while healthcare was getting rammed through congress, I think we were just trying to reflect the character of the times. I don\u2019t think you ever write for pos\u00adterity, it just happens like that.\n\nWhat set The Wall Street Journal\u2019s coverage of Oba\u00admacare apart from the rest of the coverage of Obamacare?\n\nI think we were just explaining what was in the bill. Your opinions are valuable when they reflect actual reporting. In opinion writing you can draw analysis, and your bias lets you see things the other guys miss a lot. Most jour\u00adnalists were looking at the politics, not the sub\u00adstance, of what was hap\u00adpening with the Affordable Care Act.\n\nFrom the few articles I\u2019ve read, you seem to have a very well-researched, yet col\u00adloquial and sar\u00adcastic writing style. What most informed that?\n\nIn most forms of jour\u00adnalism, you have to learn to take them on. There\u2019s a certain format you have to master, and some people never do. Learn to innovate within that style. That other thing is doing more work than you need to do on a certain article. In the opinion world, the most powerful things are bringing infor\u00admation to the table. Because it\u2019s opinion jour\u00adnalism, analysis is also important.\n\nIs Oba\u00admacare the worst piece of leg\u00adis\u00adlation ever, and can it be fixed?\n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s the worst thing ever, but The Wall Street Journal did call it the worst bill ever. All problems are ulti\u00admately fixable. We won the Cold War and did other dif\u00adficult things \u2014 I think we can fix our healthcare system.\n\nDescribe your expe\u00adrience working at the Dartmouth Review. Why have you chosen to stay involved?\n\nThe Dartmouth Review is the con\u00adser\u00advative newspaper at Dartmouth. It was founded in 1980 and gained national recog\u00adnition for fights those on staff got in with the campus admin\u00adis\u00adtration. It was a very con\u00adfronta\u00adtional period. The paper stuck around, then it mellowed out and it wasn\u2019t trying to offend people. When I was an editor, I never understood what former Dartmouth Review staff Laura Ingraham and Dinesh D\u2019Souza were upset about. I didn\u2019t find it to be like that when I was there. The Dartmouth Review is a newspaper about Dartmouth College, and it has nothing to do with national politics. Once at the Journal, I was given a dif\u00adferent topic, and those skills gained working at the Dartmouth Review were used with less juvenility.\n\nWhat does opinion jour\u00adnalism add to newspapers?\n\nIt sub\u00adtracts from most news\u00adpapers. I think if it\u2019s going to just be opinion jour\u00adnalism where \u2018this is what I think\u2019 is not going to add value to the newspaper. Your opinion isn\u2019t very valuable, and the best opinion jour\u00adnalism brings an analytic approach. The best of it reveals something about the topic that someone else missed because you\u2019re writing with a bias, so you\u2019re able to understand an issue in another way. The best opinion pieces will have some opinion at the top and some opinion at the bottom with facts in the middle. Opinion pages sell news\u00adpapers when they\u2019re well done.\n\nWhat do you think about using Twitter in journalism?\n\nIt takes up so much time and it\u2019s so personality-based. It encourages you to get in fights with people, and it encourages you to have more opinions than there are things worth having opinions about. Jour\u00adnalists have ruined their life on Twitter. That in mind, I use it con\u00adstantly. I don\u2019t think you can be a jour\u00adnalist now and not be on Twitter.\n\n- Compiled by Evan Carter", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Hillsdale Collegian", "description": "Joe Rago is a member of The Wall Street Journal\u2019s editorial board.
