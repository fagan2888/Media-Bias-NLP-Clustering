Mark Udall, D-Colo., Obama touted his administration\u2019s record of tax fairness, deficit reduction, health care and jobs. It was a record that might be news to millions of Americans who find themselves unemployed, underemployed or sidelined from the job market, not to mention those who lost the health-care coverage they were promised they would be able to keep.\n\nFrom Obama\u2019s speech:\n\n\u201cWe made our tax code fairer. We cut our deficits by more than half.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve given millions more Americans the security of health care that means you won\u2019t go broke just because you get sick.\n\n\u201cSo, thanks to the hard work of you, and some actually pretty smart policies by us, we have come farther and advanced faster than almost any other advanced nation on Earth.\n\n\u201cMore companies are choosing to bring back jobs from overseas, thanks to our leadership, technology and innovation.\n\n\u201cFor the first time in more than a decade, business leaders from around the world have declared, \u2018China\u2019s not the number one place to invest, the United States is.\u2019 And our lead is growing.\n\n\u201cSo, despite what you may hear, there is no doubt we are making progress. By almost every measure, we are better off than when I took office. By almost every measure.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a big \u201calmost,\u201d according to the government\u2019s own statistics.\n\nTake the national debt, for example. At the end of last January, the Treasury Department\u2019s Bureau of the Public Debt reported the figure had reached $17,293,019,654,983.61 \u2013 an increase of $6,666,142,606,070.53 since Obama\u2019s first inauguration.\n\nAnd even that incomprehensible figure may be vastly underestimated, according to University of California, San Diego economics professor James Hamilton, who warned last year that the government is miscalculating what it owes by leaving out certain unfunded liabilities that include government loan guarantees, deposit insurance and actions taken by the Federal Reserve as well as the cost of other government trust funds. Factoring in those figures brings the total amount the government owes to a staggering $70 trillion, Fox News reported.\n\nThat debt is not going to be paid off from taxes on wages \u2013 not with the disappointing employment figures released last week by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The number of Americans 16 and older who did not participate in the labor force climbed to a record high of 92,120,000 in June. These were people who were not only jobless, but not even seeking one in the previous four weeks. The number jumped by 111,000 since April.\n\nObama\u2019s optimism isn\u2019t shared by most Americans when it comes to the fortunes of young black Americans.\n\nA Rasmussen poll released this spring found just 16 percent of Americans thinking life for young black Americans had gotten better since Obama\u2019s election in November 2008. Twenty-two percent believed conditions had worsened. And among African-Americans themselves, only 11 percent shared Obama\u2019s optimism.\n\nObama\u2019s landmark legislation, Obamacare, is now a regret to a majority of voters, according to a Fox News poll released last month.\n\nBy a 55-38 percent margin, voters said they wished the Affordable Care Act had never passed and the 2009 system were still in place. Those expressing buyer\u2019s remorse included 25 percent of Democrats, 58 percent of independents and 85 percent of Republicans.\n\nLast week, a poll from Quinnipiac University indicated Obama\u2019s touted accomplishments had not put him in good favor with American voters: \u201cPresident Barack Obama is the worst president since World War II, 33 percent of American voters say. America would be better off if Republican Mitt Romney had won the 2012 presidential election, 45 percent of voters say, while 38 percent say the country would be worse off.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "Americans worried about the direction of the nation have nothing to fear \u2013 President Obama is assuring them they\u2019re better off than when he took office in 2009.
