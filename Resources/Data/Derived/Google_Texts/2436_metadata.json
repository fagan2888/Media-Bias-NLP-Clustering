The company is now worth nearly $27 billion ; based on Friday\u2019 closing pps of $448.37. Such a market cap is not warranted, according to De Noronha, who basis his argument on the premise that the company\u2019s business model is not sustainable.\n\n\u201cI think when you look at these overhyped stocks, and Netflix is just one of them, if you compare it to the dotcom boom where you had Amazon (AMZN) and so on, everybody knew Amazon was a good service, everybody saw Amazon turn into a gigantic company that pretty much serves every kind of thing you need. But it was the wrong price, just like it is the wrong price now for Netflix,\u201d Noronha said on CNBC.\n\nThe Street is mixed about its views towards Netflix ; and for a good reason.
