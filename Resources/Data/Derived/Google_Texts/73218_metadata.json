Its ignorance of the province\u2019s language, culture and history stymied the mission and led to tribal leaders \u2014 \u201cthe greatest natural politicians I\u2019ve ever come across,\u201d Martin said \u2014 manipulating coalition forces to settle their own scores.\n\n\u201cOur biggest failure was a failure to understand,\u201d he said at a promotional event for the book Wednesday at London\u2019s Royal United Services Institute.\n\nWestern forces tend to view Afghanistan\u2019s recent history as a series of distinct conflicts \u2014 the Soviet war, civil war, Taliban rule \u2014 whereas locals in Helmand see those decades as a single ongoing battle over land, water and other resources.\n\nCoalition forces paid dearly for failing to appreciate that history. More than 400 of Britain\u2019s 448 casualties in Afghanistan died in Helmand.\n\n\u201cWhen they deployed to the north, the communities had no knowledge of why there were British soldiers arriving in their villages and the British had no idea as to who their friends or enemies were,\u201d Martin wrotein an excerpt published in the Independent newspaper.\n\n\u201cBy this point the Helmandis were 28 years into their conflict and there was no patience for a historical enemy.\u201d\n\nBoth American and British forces got better at dealing with insurgents over time, says Theo Farrell, head of the War Studies Department at King\u2019s College London.\n\n\u201cArmies make mistakes in war, and in the early parts of war armies make lots of mistakes because you know what? Wars are bloody difficult,\u201d Farrell said at RUSI.\n\nThe book is Martin\u2019s dissertation for a doctoral degree. The ministry held the manuscript for more than a year before raising objections in February, he said.\n\nOn Tuesday, Martin resigned his commission, freeing the book to be published next month. He now works in Myanmar for a political risk firm.\n\nThe book comes at a crossroads for the armed forces. On April 1, the army handed control of Camp Bastion \u2014 the UK\u2019s main base in Afghanistan \u2014 to US forces and officially ended its eight-year mission in Helmand.\n\nBy the end of this year, Britain will have withdrawn completely from its fourth war in Afghanistan in 175 years.\n\nMeanwhile, the Defense Ministry is facing cuts that will reduce the standing army to 82,000 troops by 2020, half its size during the Cold War.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time the military has fought to keep a book from the public.\n\nIn 2011, it paid $251,000 for the entire print run of \u201cDead Men Risen,\u201d journalist Toby Harnden\u2019s account of the Welsh Guards\u2019 2009 Afghanistan tour, and shredded all 24,000 copies. The book was eventually published with just 50 words trimmed.\n\nThe effort to silence Martin seems to have backfired as well. By Thursday night, the book was number 45 on Amazon\u2019s UK bestseller list.\n\n\u201cThey usually shoot themselves in the foot, some way or another,\u201d Martin said.\n\nThis article was published on Global Post.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The UK authorities are trying to block their own report on Afghanistan.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "Corinne Purtill", "og": {"site_name": "MintPress News", "description": "The UK authorities are trying to block their own report on Afghanistan.", "title": "The British Army Doesn\u2019t Want You To Read This Book", "url": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/british-army-doesnt-want-read-book/188726/", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/AP96774789925.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The UK authorities are trying to block their own report on Afghanistan.", "title": "The British Army Doesn\u2019t Want You To Read This Book", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/AP96774789925.jpg", "creator": "@MintPressNews", "site": "@MintPressNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100003161352196}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MintpressNewsMPN", "section": "Foreign Affairs", "tag": "Wikileaks", "published_time": "2014-04-11T08:36:32-05:00"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf36f\"", "article_summary": "The British Army Doesn\u2019t Want You To Read This BookThe UK authorities are trying to block their own report on Afghanistan.\nLONDON, UK \u2014 Three years ago, the Defense Ministry commissioned a young officer to write a book about British military operations in Helmand Province, the volatile region in Afghanistan that has claimed hundreds of British casualties.\nBy the end of this year, Britain will have withdrawn completely from its fourth war in Afghanistan in 175 years.\nOn Tuesday, Martin resigned his commission, freeing the book to be published next month.\n\u201cI read every word of every draft of each chapter,\u201d said Alexander Alderson, who as head of counterinsurgency in Helmand was Martin\u2019s boss in Afghanistan."}
