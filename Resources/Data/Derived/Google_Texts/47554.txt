GOP frontrunner Donald Trump slammed Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), Fox News and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) during his town hall in Bluffton, South Carolina on Wednesday morning.

“It’s been an amazing experience,” Trump said when asked how it has been on the campaign trail for the past eight months. “There’s a lot of dishonesty in politics,” Trump added. “In particular, Senator Cruz – he’ll say anything!”

Trump said Cruz has stated Trump supports Obamacare and is against the Second Amendment, both allegations Trump says are absolutely false. He vowed to repeal Obamacare and protect the Second Amendment. “Where does he come up with this stuff?” Trump questioned of Cruz.

“Cruz does lie,” he added, referencing Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) also calling Cruz a liar during the GOP primary debate last Saturday.

Trump then turned from criticizing Cruz to going after Fox News when he was asked how the media has treated him during his presidential campaign.

“I was watching Fox this morning,” Trump responded. “They have pundits on that are just one after the other, negative.”

The real estate mogul said Fox News mistreats him.

“I think Fox in particular treats me so badly, it’s incredible,” he charged. “It doesn’t matter I guess,” he added, referencing his big win in the New Hampshire primary last week and his lead in the polls. “All I can do is tell the truth.”

Earlier in the morning, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) – who is backing former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush – appeared on Fox News slamming Trump.

The GOP frontrunner also responded to Graham’s criticism during the town hall.

“You have one of the worst representatives of any representative in the United States,” Trump told his South Carolina supporters at the town hall about Graham.

“I don’t think he could run for dog catcher in this state and win,” he charged. “He’s a terrible representative for this state.”
