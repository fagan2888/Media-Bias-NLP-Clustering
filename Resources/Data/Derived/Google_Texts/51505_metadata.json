A total of 22 such employees recently lost their benefits under the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cI just can\u2019t thank you enough for being a board that thinks about our teachers and our classified teachers as human beings,\u201d said Carmel Creek School teacher Katie Zimmer.\n\nA total of 46 classified employees were eligible for benefits when the ACA went into effect last year. In a letter two days before Thanksgiving, 22 of those employees learned that they no longer qualified for health care under the ACA and that their current benefits would end at the close of 2015.\n\nA third-party company called Worxtime, an ACA compliance web application, calculated their hours and found that they were not eligible to receive benefits mandated by the ACA guidelines. Although some of the classified employees had worked at least six hours per day, school breaks impacted their totals.\n\n\u201cThe 22 employees qualified the year before because when we ran the calculations, we thought that those weeks off shouldn\u2019t be counted. As it turns out, they do count,\u201d Superintendent Terry Decker explained in an interview, noting that the district also calculated the hours. \u201cThe Affordable Care Act is built for the corporate world \u2014 52 weeks a year. We have two weeks of winter break. We have a week at Thanksgiving. That time period keeps clocking.\u201d\n\nSeveral classified employees shared their concerns before the board during the regularly scheduled Dec. 14 meeting.\n\n\u201cLast year, when I received health benefits through the district for the first time, I was thrilled,\u201d said Lori Wolf, who has worked for the district for nearly 24 years She serves as a computer lab instructor at Solana Vista School. \u201cI did not anticipate that my health benefits could be taken away so abruptly. The way this was done was unfair and harsh.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe left that Thanksgiving break confused and disheartened,\u201d said Robin Park, an instructional aide in the special education department at Solana Vista School.\n\n\u201cEducating requires teamwork,\u201d he added. \u201cI think it is time classified and certificated employees be treated equally and fairly.\u201d\n\nCertificated staff also showed their support.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important for us to recognize that our classified staff have made a commitment to their school communities and to the students that they serve to be here for the school year,\u201d said Solana Pacific School teacher Laura Stuber. \u201cTheir ability to do this is based partly on their salary and partly on having benefits.\n\n\u201cThe perception of our tight-knit community in Solana Beach is that we take care of our own,\u201d she added.\n\nBecause the issue was not among the board\u2019s agenda items, board members could not speak on the subject, according to the Brown Act. Within days, however, the district called a special meeting to address the matter on Dec. 18.\n\nIn a 4-0 vote, the board revised its policies so that benefits could be offered through the district and not dependent on the ACA. Board member Richard Leib was absent from both meetings.\n\nThe only ways the district can provide benefits, Decker explained, is by law, such as the ACA, by contract, such as the contract with the Solana Beach Teachers Association, and by board policy. With the board\u2019s revised policies, the district will now offer medical coverage to classified employees that meet the requirements as well as their dependent children.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t bend the law for Affordable Care Act,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to implement it as written.\u201d\n\nDecker said this is the same type of coverage they would have received had they qualified for coverage under the ACA. He also confirmed there will be no break in coverage.\n\n\u201cShould that law (the ACA) ever be altered or repealed in the future, the medical benefits for our employees will not be at risk,\u201d Decker said.\n\nHe pointed out that the revised policies do not affect the employees who already receive health coverage.\n\n\u201cThe revisions do not take anything away from anyone who is now covered, nor do they add anything to anyone who is already covered,\u201d Decker explained. \u201cThe only additions are those that affect our six-hour classified employees.\u201d\n\nBecause the district had already budgeted for the benefits, the policy revisions will not result in added costs, Decker said. And going forward, the district will no longer track the hours of the six-hour employees. The district will, however, continue to calculate the hours of employees who work fewer than six hours in case they end up meeting the threshold.\n\nFollowing the vote, board members thanked district staff for their work in resolving the issue, specifically Decker, Carlos Estrella, assistant superintendent of business services, and Sal Gumina, director of human resources.\n\n\u201cIt really took a lot of extra effort,\u201d said board member Julie Union.\n\n\u201cThey had to do things by board policy,\u201d board member Debra Schade said on behalf of district staff. \u201cWe have moved so incredibly swiftly. I really don\u2019t know how it was all turned around that quickly.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very grateful that we were able to get this tuned around quickly,\u201d agreed board member Holly Lewry. \u201cI know there was a lot of hard work behind the scenes.\u201d\n\nBoard members also thanked the previous meeting\u2019s speakers for bringing the matter to the board.\n\n\u201cI believe that every difficult situation has a silver lining,\u201d board president Vicki King said. \u201cOne of the silver linings in this, among many, is that we, as a board, got to see and believe and feel the passion that you all have for your jobs.\n\n\u201cIt was difficult on Monday for me to hear that but it really showed me the passion and how fortunate we are as a district to have not just the teaching staff, but the classified staff that do some of the hardest work for our students and our children.\u201d\n\nIn an interview, Decker acknowledged the news about the benefits was \u201cheartbreaking\u201d for staff and said that the district had worked ever since to change the situation. With the support of the board, the district was able to provide benefits, he said.\n\nAlthough benefits were reinstated through board policy revisions, the issue sparked concerns among some classified staff.\n\nSpearheaded by Park, some classified staff members have since expressed interest in forming a labor union called the Solana Beach Association of Support Professionals or SBASP.\n\n\u201cI, personally, am very thankful for it (the revised policies) because it directly affects me,\u201d said Park, who has worked for the district for four years. He served as a physical education instructor for the first three years. \u201cI am a six-hour employee and I now am going to be receiving benefits.\u201d\n\nHowever, Park pointed out that because it is a policy change, the policy could be changed again in the future. For this, and other reasons, classified staff has since obtained the number of signatures necessary to petition the state\u2019s Public Employment Relations Board to mandate the district to hold an anonymous mail-out ballot vote for the establishment of a union.\n\n\u201cThis sparked the fire,\u201d Park said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have contracts because we are unrepresented.\u201d\n\nPark said the district\u2019s certificated employees have not only supported the efforts of the classified employees but also initially contacted the California Teachers Association for assistance.\n\n\u201cIf anybody knows how hard we work, it\u2019s them,\u201d Park said.\n\n\u201cThere are no bad guys,\u201d he added. \u201cThe bigger picture is that we want to build an alliance. It\u2019s not like we are asking for more; we\u2019re just asking for what\u2019s mandated by the government. In order for us to do our job, we need this.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Solana Beach, classified employees, employees, benefits, union, solana beach school district", "og": {"site_name": "Del Mar Times", "description": "The school board voted unanimously during a special meeting on Dec. 18 to revise its policies and offer medical insurance for classified employees who regularly work at least six hours per day and 30 hours per week.", "title": "Solana Beach classified employees receive benefits, consider forming union", "url": "http://www.delmartimes.net/news/2015/dec/28/solana-beach-school-district-employees-benefits/", "image": "http://media.delmartimes.net/img/photos/2015/01/26/IMG_0189_tx201.JPG?a7afd4f196cc87f88131a6d97e3ddf50b1644c7d", "type": "article"}, "\u201drobots\u201d": "\u201dnoodp\u201d", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=478488999", "fb": {"admins": 100002822783687, "app_id": 227086564005280}, "msvalidate.01": "2AF9F2CAA01E4774AB920A8D645E9566", "verify-v1": "6ylWgY9aqB0mJpcLJKDC73u2SDU/3xlc3MH+PxXmLRY=", "y_key": "f9413f5ffc5479bd", "viewport": "width=device-width", "description": "The school board voted unanimously during a special meeting on Dec. 18 to revise its policies and offer medical insurance for classified employees who regularly work at least six hours per day and 30 hours per week."}, "article_summary": "Christmas came early for some Solana Beach School District classified employees when their health benefits were reinstated last week.\nSpearheaded by Park, some classified staff members have since expressed interest in forming a labor union called the Solana Beach Association of Support Professionals or SBASP.\nA total of 46 classified employees were eligible for benefits when the ACA went into effect last year.\nThat time period keeps clocking.\u201dSeveral classified employees shared their concerns before the board during the regularly scheduled Dec. 14 meeting.\nAlthough some of the classified employees had worked at least six hours per day, school breaks impacted their totals."}
