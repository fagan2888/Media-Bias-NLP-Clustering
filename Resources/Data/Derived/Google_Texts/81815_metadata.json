Last winter\u2019s fiscal cliff seems like child\u2019s play in comparison to the latest partisan battles.\n\nWhere does our region\u2019s congressman, Chris Gibson of Columbia County, stand with what\u2019s happening? And what about his recently declared challenger for the 2014 battle for New York\u2019s 19th Congressional District, Sean Eldridge of Shokan?\n\n\u201cThis should never have happened,\u201d the second-term GOP representative from Kinderhook said by phone on Columbus Day. \u201cThe CR [Continuing Resolution] that we had before us only hours before the government closed was a very reasonable bill that should have been enacted. Even nine Democrats voted along with us on this, including my New York congressional colleagues Dan Maffei and Sean Patrick Maloney.\u201d\n\nGibson was referring to a September 30 measure that struggled through the House of Representatives with elements that would strip the Affordable Care Act of subsidies and expand a one-year moratorium on tax penalties for businesses to everyone involved. He mainly blamed the president and Senate majority leader Harry Reid for the stalemate, shutdown, and debt-ceiling brinksmanship.\n\nThe former career Army officer and former West Point instructor talked of his role as a member of the No Labels bipartisan group of senators and congressmen headed by Joe Manchin and Jon Huntsman, and including congresspersons Maffei, Maloney and Bill Owens amongst its membership. All have pledged to restore moderation to the nation\u2019s governance.\n\nAmong No Labels\u2019 recent contributions to the discussion in D.C. have been the reach for a Senate proposal by senators Manchin (D-West Virginia) and Susan Collins (R-Maine), to push the CR and debt-ceiling deadlines forward several months with a delay on the medical-device-tax provision of the ACA and several other items.\n\n\u201cThat was an outgrowth of what we were working on at No Labels, and we\u2019re continuing to push it,\u201d Gibson said. The group is now meeting daily. \u201cI don\u2019t see how Harry Reid or the president can allow us to default when they have solutions before them \u2026. I\u2019ve taught history at West Point and you think back to all that happened in 1929 and it\u2019s not the speaker of the house whose name one remembers but that of Herbert Hoover, the president.\u201d\n\nCommon-sense things\n\nSean Eldridge, speaking in his new campaign offices in Kingston, spoke quickly and with self-assurance. He had announced his candidacy as a Democratic challenger to Gibson only weeks earlier.\n\n\u201cThis is all a shining example of how dysfunctional we\u2019ve become. There are so many common-sense things we could be working on, from infrastructure to the training of our workers for a changing economy, and instead we\u2019re having this governmental shutdown,\u201d said the 27-year-old founder of a Hudson Valley venture capital fund and a major contributor to the new Advanced Manufacturing Center pioneering 3D imaging work at SUNY New Paltz. \u201cIt\u2019s unnecessary. It\u2019s irresponsible. It\u2019s harming our economy, and it\u2019s harming families in this area. I think people are very frustrated. We want our government to be getting to work for us and not to be focused on these partisan battles that aren\u2019t helping anyone.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Woodstock Times", "description": "Everyone\u2019s been on the edge of their seats regarding Washington politics of late, with the shutdown entering its third week and the debt ceiling like some image out of Lewis Carroll.\u00a0Last winter\u2019s \u2026", "title": "Gibson, Eldridge are on opposite sides of national debate", "url": "http://www.woodstockx.com/2013/10/20/gibson-eldridge-are-on-opposite-sides-of-national-debate/", "image": {"width": 290, "identifier": "http://www.woodstockx.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/gibson-and-eldridge-SQ.jpg", "height": 290}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_time": "2013-10-20T10:30:02+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-10-17T19:41:57+00:00"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfe55\"", "article_summary": "And what about his recently declared challenger for the 2014 battle for New York\u2019s 19th Congressional District, Sean Eldridge of Shokan?\n\u201cThat was an outgrowth of what we were working on at No Labels, and we\u2019re continuing to push it,\u201d Gibson said.\nWhere does our region\u2019s congressman, Chris Gibson of Columbia County, stand with what\u2019s happening?\nHe mainly blamed the president and Senate majority leader Harry Reid for the stalemate, shutdown, and debt-ceiling brinksmanship.\nHe had announced his candidacy as a Democratic challenger to Gibson only weeks earlier."}
