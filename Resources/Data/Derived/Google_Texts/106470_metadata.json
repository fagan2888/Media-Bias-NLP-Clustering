Three times I stood atop the mountain the Athabaskans call Denali, \u201cthe great one.\u201d During that decade, I mountaineered for more than half a year on that magnificent state\u2019s highest peaks. It was there that I took in my own insignificance while living amid rock and ice, sleeping atop glaciers that creaked and moaned as they slowly ground their way toward lower elevations.\n\nAlaska contains the largest coastal mountain range in the world and the highest peak in North America. It has more coastline than the entire contiguous 48 states combined and is big enough to hold the state of Texas two and a half times over. It has the largest population of bald eagles in the country. It has 430 kinds of birds along with the brown bear, the largest carnivorous land mammal in the world, and other species ranging from the pygmy shrew that weighs less than a penny to gray whales that come in at 45 tons. Species that are classified as \u201cendangered\u201d in other places are often found in abundance in Alaska.\n\nNow, a dozen years after I left my home state and landed in Baghdad to begin life as a journalist and nine years after definitively abandoning Alaska, I find myself back. I wish it was to climb another mountain, but this time, unfortunately, it\u2019s because I seem increasingly incapable of escaping the long and destructive reach of the U.S. military.\n\nThat summer in 2003 when my life in Alaska ended was an unnerving one for me. It followed a winter and spring in which I found myself protesting the coming invasion of Iraq in the streets of Anchorage, then impotently watching the televised spectacle of the Bush administration\u2019s \u201cshock and awe\u201d assault on that country as Baghdad burned and Iraqis were slaughtered. While on Denali that summer I listened to news of the beginnings of what would be an occupation from hell and, in my tent on a glacier at 17,000 feet, wondered what in the world I could do.\n\nIn this way, in a cloud of angst, I traveled to Iraq as an independent news team of one and found myself reporting on atrocities that were evident to anyone not embedded with the U.S. military, which was then laying waste to the country. My early reporting, some of it for TomDispatch, warned of body counts on a trajectory toward one million, rampant torture in the military\u2019s detention facilities, and the toxic legacy it had left in the city of Fallujah thanks to the use of depleted uranium munitions and white phosphorous.\n\nAs I learned, the U.S. military is an industrial-scale killing machine and also the single largest consumer of fossil fuels on the planet, which makes it a major source of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide. As it happens, distant lands like Iraq sitting atop vast reservoirs of oil and natural gas are by no means its only playing fields.\n\nTake the place where I now live, the Olympic Peninsula in Washington state. The U.S. Navy already has plans to conduct electromagnetic warfare training in an area close to where I moved to once again seek solace in the mountains: Olympic National Forest and nearby Olympic National Park. And this June, it\u2019s scheduling massive war games in the Gulf of Alaska, including live bombing runs that will mean the detonation of tens of thousands of pounds of toxic munitions, as well as the use of active sonar in the most pristine, economically valuable, and sustainable salmon fishery in the country (arguably in the world). And all of this is to happen right in the middle of fishing season.\n\nThis time, in other words, the bombs will be falling far closer to home. Whether it\u2019s war-torn Iraq or \u201cpeaceful\u201d Alaska, Sunnis and Shi\u2019ites or salmon and whales, to me the omnipresent \u201cfootprint\u201d of the U.S. military feels inescapable.\n\nThe War Comes Home\n\nIn 2013, U.S. Navy researchers predicted ice-free summer Arctic waters by 2016 and it looks as if that prediction might come true. Recently, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) reported that there was less ice in the Arctic this winter than in any other winter of the satellite era. Given that the Navy has been making plans for \u201cice-free\u201d operations in the Arctic since at least 2001, their June \u201cNorthern Edge\u201d exercises may well prove to be just the opening salvo in the future northern climate wars, with whales, seals, and salmon being the first in the line of fire.\n\nIn April 2001, a Navy symposium entitled \u201cNaval Operations in an Ice-Free Arctic\u201d was mounted to begin to prepare the service for a climate-change-induced future. Fast forward to June 2015. In what the military refers to as Alaska\u2019s \u201cpremier\u201d joint training exercise, Alaskan Command aims to conduct \u201cNorthern Edge\u201d over 8,429 nautical miles, which include critical habitat for all five wild Alaskan salmon species and 377 other species of marine life. The upcoming war games in the Gulf of Alaska will not be the first such exercises in the region \u2014 they have been conducted, on and off, for the last 30 years \u2014 but they will be the largest by far. In fact, a 360% rise in munitions use is expected, according to Emily Stolarcyk, the program manager for the Eyak Preservation Council (EPC).\n\nThe waters in the Gulf of Alaska are some of the most pristine in the world, rivaled only by those in the Antarctic, and among the purest and most nutrient-rich waters anywhere. Northern Edge will take place in an Alaskan \u201cmarine protected area,\u201d as well as in a NOAA-designated \u201cfisheries protected area.\u201d These war games will also coincide with the key breeding and migratory periods of the marine life in the region as they make their way toward Prince William Sound, as well as further north into the Arctic.\n\nSpecies affected will include blue, fin, gray, humpback, minke, sei, sperm, and killer whales, the highly endangered North Pacific right whale (of which there are only approximately 30 left), as well as dolphins and sea lions. No fewer than a dozen native tribes including the Eskimo, Eyak, Athabascan, Tlingit, Sun\u2019aq, and Aleut rely on the area for subsistence living, not to speak of their cultural and spiritual identities.\n\nThe Navy is already permitted to use live ordnance including bombs, missiles, and torpedoes, along with active and passive sonar in \u201crealistic\u201d war gaming that is expected to involve the release of as much as 352,000 pounds of \u201cexpended materials\u201d every year. (The Navy\u2019s EIS lists numerous things as \u201cexpended materials,\u201d including missiles, bombs, torpedoes.) At present, the Navy is well into the process of securing the necessary permits for the next five years and has even mentioned making plans for the next 20. Large numbers of warships and submarines are slated to move into the area and the potential pollution from this has worried Alaskans who live nearby.\n\n\u201cWe are concerned about expended materials in addition to the bombs, jet noise, and sonar,\u201d the Eyak Preservation Council\u2019s Emily Stolarcyk tells me as we sit in her office in Cordova, Alaska. EPC is an environmental and social-justice-oriented nonprofit whose primary mission is to protect wild salmon habitat. \u201cChromium, lead, tungsten, nickel, cadmium, cyanide, ammonium perchlorate, the Navy\u2019s own environmental impact statement says there is a high risk of chemical exposure to fish.\u201d\n\nTiny Cordova, population 2,300, is home to the largest commercial fishing fleet in the state and consistently ranks among the top 10 busiest U.S. fishing ports. Since September, when Stolarcyk first became aware of the Navy\u2019s plans, she has been working tirelessly, calling local, state and federal officials and alerting virtually every fisherman she runs into about what she calls \u201cthe storm\u201d looming on the horizon. \u201cThe propellants from the Navy\u2019s missiles and some of their other weapons will release benzene, toluene, xylene, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and naphthalene into the waters of twenty percent of the training area, according to their own EIS [environmental impact statement],\u201d she explains as we look down on Cordova\u2019s harbor with salmon fishing season rapidly approaching. As it happens, most of the chemicals she mentioned were part of BP\u2019s disastrous 2010 oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, which I covered for years, so as I listened to her I had an eerie sense of futuristic d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.\n\nHere\u2019s just one example of the kinds of damage that will occur: the cyanide discharge from a Navy torpedo is in the range of 140-150 parts per billion. The Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s \u201callowable\u201d limit on cyanide: one part per billion.\n\nThe Navy\u2019s EIS estimates that, in the five-year period in which these war games are to be conducted, there will be more than 182,000 \u201ctakes\u201d \u2014 direct deaths of a marine mammal, or the disruption of essential behaviors like breeding, nursing, or surfacing. On the deaths of fish, it offers no estimates at all. Nevertheless, the Navy will be permitted to use at least 352,000 pounds of expended materials in these games annually. The potential negative effects could be far-reaching, given species migration and the global current system in northern waters.\n\nIn the meantime, the Navy is giving Stolarcyk\u2019s efforts the cold shoulder, showing what she calls \u201ctotal disregard toward the people making their living from these waters.\u201d She adds, \u201cThey say this is for national security. They are theoretically defending us, but if they destroy our food source and how we make our living, while polluting our air and water, what\u2019s left to defend?\u201d\n\nStolarcyk has been labeled an \u201cactivist\u201d and \u201cenvironmentalist,\u201d perhaps because the main organizations she\u2019s managed to sign on to her efforts are indeed environmental groups like the Alaska Marine Conservation Counciland the Alaskans First Coalition.\n\n\u201cWhy does wanting to protect wild salmon habitat make me an activist?\u201d she asks. \u201cHow has that caused me to be branded as an environmentalist?\u201d Given that the Alaska commercial fishing industry could be decimated if its iconic \u201cwild-caught\u201d salmon turn up with traces of cyanide or any of the myriad chemicals the Navy will be using, Stolarcyk could as easily be seen as fighting for the well-being, if not the survival, of the fishing industry in her state.\n\nWar Gaming the Community\n\nThe clock is ticking in Cordova and others in Stolarcyk\u2019s community are beginning to share her concerns. A few like Alexis Cooper, the executive director of Cordova District Fishermen United (CDFU), a non-profit organization that represents the commercial fishermen in the area, have begun to speak out. \u201cWe\u2019re already seeing reduced numbers of halibut without the Navy having expanded their operations in the GOA [Gulf of Alaska],\u201d she says, \u201cand we\u2019re already seeing other decreases in harvestable species.\u201d\n\nCDFU represents more than 800 commercial salmon fishermen, an industry that accounts for an estimated 90% of Cordova\u2019s economy. Without salmon, like many other towns along coastal southeastern Alaska, it would effectively cease to exist.\n\nTeal Webber, a lifelong commercial fisherwoman and member of the Native Village of Eyak, gets visibly upset when the Navy\u2019s plans come up. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t bomb a bunch of farmland,\u201d she says, \u201cand the salmon run comes right through this area, so why are they doing this now?\u201d She adds, \u201cWhen all of the fishing community in Cordova gets the news about how much impact the Navy\u2019s war games could have, you\u2019ll see them oppose it en masse.\u201d\n\nWhile I\u2019m in town, Stolarcyk offers a public presentation of the case against Northern Edge in the elementary school auditorium. As she shows a slide from the Navy\u2019s environmental impact statement indicating that the areas affected will take decades to recover, several fishermen quietly shake their heads.\n\nOne of them, James Weiss, who also works for Alaska\u2019s Fish and Game Department, pulls me aside and quietly says, \u201cMy son is growing up here, eating everything that comes out of the sea. I know fish travel through that area they plan to bomb and pollute, so of course I\u2019m concerned. This is too important of a fishing area to put at risk.\u201d\n\nIn the question-and-answer session that follows, Jim Kasch, the town\u2019s mayor, assures Stolarcyk that he\u2019ll ask the city council to become involved. \u201cWhat\u2019s disturbing is that there is no thought about the fish and marine life,\u201d he tells me later. \u201cIt\u2019s a sensitive area and we live off the ocean. This is just scary.\u201d A Marine veteran, Kasch acknowledges the Navy\u2019s need to train, then pauses and adds, \u201cBut dropping live ordnance in a sensitive fishery just isn\u2019t a good idea. The entire coast of Alaska lives and breathes from our resources from the ocean.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "This fishing season, the government plans to detonate thousands of pounds of toxic munitions in the Gulf of Alaska", "title": "The U.S. Navy\u2019s brutal new war on the Arctic", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "This fishing season, the government plans to detonate thousands of pounds of toxic munitions in the Gulf of Alaska", "title": "The U.S. Navy\u2019s brutal new war on the Arctic", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/05/24/the_u_s_navys_brutal_new_war_on_the_arctic_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/shutterstock_216478606.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "This fishing season, the government plans to detonate thousands of pounds of toxic munitions in the Gulf of Alaska", "title": "The U.S. Navy\u2019s brutal new war on the Arctic", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/shutterstock_216478606.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Dahr Jamail", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Alaska, California, Navy, TomDispatch.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The War Comes HomeIn 2013, U.S. Navy researchers predicted ice-free summer Arctic waters by 2016 and it looks as if that prediction might come true.\nWar Gaming the CommunityThe clock is ticking in Cordova and others in Stolarcyk\u2019s community are beginning to share her concerns.\nTeal Webber, a lifelong commercial fisherwoman and member of the Native Village of Eyak, gets visibly upset when the Navy\u2019s plans come up.\nIn April 2001, a Navy symposium entitled \u201cNaval Operations in an Ice-Free Arctic\u201d was mounted to begin to prepare the service for a climate-change-induced future.\n(The Navy\u2019s EIS lists numerous things as \u201cexpended materials,\u201d including missiles, bombs, torpedoes.)"}
