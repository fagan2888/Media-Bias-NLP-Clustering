Young entrepreneurs are bringing their business ideas to life with the help of both the provincial government and Hamilton's Small Business Enterprise Centre.

Summer Company, an eight- to 12-week program, provides hands-on business training and mentoring to young people who want to turn their talents into profitable businesses.

Queens Park funds the program, but training and administration is handled locally.

Mentors teach these young entrepreneurs sales, marketing, invoicing, bookkeeping, customer relationships, management and more.

To qualify, candidates must be between 15 and 29 and willing to dedicate at least 35 hours a week to their business venture.

They must be full-time students, returning to school in the fall. Most importantly, their visions for small businesses must be achievable in a two- to three-month span.

Candidates must submit a completed business plan and take part in an interview with program administrators before qualifying.

Those accepted are given up to $1,500 to help with start-up costs, and an additional grant of the same value upon successful completion.

This year, 24 students were accepted from Hamilton â€“ 920 across the province.
