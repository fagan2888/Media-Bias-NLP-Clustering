If you got married or had a child in the previous year, Plan A is probably best for you. If you have no dependents, Plan B will work. Plan C handled all the rest. Rinse and repeat. Every year. It was handled.\n\nFast forward to today, and we see a brave new world of healthcare developing where accountability is paramount, the patient as consumer rules, and individuals \u2013 not employers \u2013 are responsible choosing their own insurance plan.

Millions of people in the United States now have health insurance available to them under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. This has led healthcare organizations to react with urgency. The captive audience of employees is no longer a sure thing. Now, meeting their goals depend upon patient perceptions and behavior. An inability to drive meaningful behavior change is a major issue.\n\nMedicine can look to leading consumer products companies, connecting with patients\u2019 emotions, to communicate more effectively and drive desired behaviors. I grew up in marketing at P&G, where our mantra, coined by CEO A.G. Lafley, was \u201cthe Consumer is Boss.\u201d We conducted extensive market research and let consumer insights drive our strategies and advertising.

According to research by Johns Hopkins\u2019 schools of Public Health and Medicine, 53 percent of physicians are overweight or obese.
