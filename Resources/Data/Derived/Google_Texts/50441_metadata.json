First she said it was a heart attack. I learned later he\u2019d blown his head off with a shotgun. Even though I never knew my father (he\u2019d left when I was 12 months old) his suicide affected me in the coming years. He must have been deeply flawed to have done that, which meant I was too, I thought.\n\nWhen I was 24 I killed an associate with an assault rifle. Between my father\u2019s suicide with a gun, and committing murder with a gun, I\u2019m part of America\u2019s ugly phenomenon: Upwards of 20,000 people commit suicide with a gun and 11,000 are murdered with a gun annually \u2014 yet many dismiss guns as the problem. I do take responsibility for the murder; I\u2019m sorry for taking his life, and all the life he could have had but without a gun I would not have killed\u2026 a bold claim that screams rationalization, I know. But God knows I believe this to be true.\n\nIf I didn\u2019t have that perfect killing machine I would have had to earn the kill \u2014 like a seasoned bow hunter I\u2019d have to hit him just right leaving no room for error. Could I have stabbed him? Strangled him? Bludgeoned him? If I had done so and he hadn\u2019t died, why would that have made me less culpable than I am now, a man who swiftly and cowardly shot another man to death? A killer nonetheless, I hash these things out, in my head, in my cell, in Attica serving 28 years to life.\n\nHe sneaked upon me in the prison yard like I sneaked upon his friend in a Brooklyn street. When I turned, I saw his arm swing for my neck. I weaved. Then I felt the piercing blows, as he gripped my shirt and dug into my side. Pressured by the blood-thirsty crowd, he stabbed me six times because I shot his friend to death. The ice pick didn\u2019t do the job, though. He got away with it because we were in a blind spot of the yard, and I never told on him. Prison ethics. While my assailant\u2019s intent was clear, the weapon he had access to was insufficient. Therefore I lived.\n\nThe mantra \u201cguns don\u2019t kill people, people kill people\u201d reverberates throughout our society. How about \u201cpeople kill less people without guns?\u201d It\u2019s clear that the only reason I\u2019m alive is because my assailant didn\u2019t have his weapon of choice. Can you imagine if we had access to guns in prison?\n\nI may have succumbed to suicide if I had a gun in prison. Hanging myself seemed grim, it would entail suffocating which reminded me of bad dreams about drowning. To hang until death you have to be dead set on suicide. Where the pain of life shadows the pain you will experience strangling yourself to death. It\u2019s chilling.\n\nYet men amongst me have hanged themselves. I remember the last lifeless body that wheeled past my cell on a gurney. We shared the same first name, same murder conviction, same life sentence, and both hailed from Brooklyn. I was confounded by his last conversation, which seemed upbeat. By the obscure banging noise I heard only moments before\u2026 only to realize that the noise was his feet flailing against the cell wall, instinctively fighting for a life he no longer wanted.\n\nThough I didn\u2019t care too much about my life \u2013 or else I wouldn\u2019t have taken someone else\u2019s \u2013 I wasn\u2019t determined to kill myself. At least not like that. I was determined, however, to get high and not feel. And if I faded out on a good batch of prison smack \u2013 heroin \u2013 then\u2026 oh well. Yet when withdrawing from the drugs I found myself down in the depths of depression, like my father whipped from alcoholism, and at that point I too could have impulsively blown my head off. To some extent I\u2019m glad I was sent to an environment without guns \u2013 because I was able to survive suicide and murder. In so-called free society, revenge for the man I killed probably would have unfolded with a shot to my head.\n\nPerhaps a gun doesn\u2019t entice ones appetite for murder (it did mine though) or suicide. But it is the perfect tool to carry out the act when the thought arises. Many murders and suicides would be fleeting thoughts if guns weren\u2019t so ubiquitous.\n\nAs our country remains incredibly polarized by this debate, a Machiavellian gun sector sits off to the side enjoying record earnings. I\u2019m all for the market system, but when the products are killing machines, why shouldn\u2019t we tighten measures to keep guns out of the hands of people like me? I suggested a few simple laws that could affect criminal behavior, in my article at the Atlantic online. But Washington does nothing.\n\nTruly I\u2019m blown away. Is the status quo really okay? Until we relinquish our apathy I suppose we\u2019ll keep pretending this is the greatest nation on earth as we parade through life to the relentless drumbeat of death.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20131214140333, "BN": "kristof", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "kristof", "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/kristof/post", "DISPLAYDATE": "December 14, 2013", "keywords": "Uncategorized", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/kristof/A Perspective on Guns, Murder, Suicide from Attica ( 20131214 )", "PT": "Blogs", "author": "John J.
