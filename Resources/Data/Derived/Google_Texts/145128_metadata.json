Jerry Brown used his State of the State address to challenge lawmakers to better balance the cyclical nature of success and setback that has dominated state government for the better part of two decades.\n\n\"The challenge is to solve today's problems without making those of tomorrow even worse,\u201d the governor said in his annual speech delivered from the Assembly chamber Thursday.\n\nBrown, interrupted by occasional applause from legislators, touched on themes that included California\u2019s drought and the challenges of income inequality and terrorism.\n\nJoin the conversation on Facebook >>\n\nBut he purposely stopped short of proposing new state government projects, leaving the impression he was more interested in raising awareness than sparking action.\n\n\"You are not going to hear me talk today about new programs,\u201d the governor said. \u201cRather, I am going to focus on how we pay for the commitments we have already made.\u201d\n\nThat focus included not only long-term items like pensions for public employees, but also the more recent expansion of healthcare for low-income families through the Medi-Cal program and for others through the Covered California healthcare exchange.\n\nBrown boasted that the state had \u201cwholeheartedly embraced\u201d President Obama's Affordable Care Act. \u201cThis is an historic achievement,\u201d he said to applause from Democrats in the Assembly and Senate.\n\nThe speech came two weeks after Brown sent a $170.7-billion budget to the Legislature for the fiscal year that begins in July.\n\nThat spending plan acknowledges another year of better-than-forecast tax revenue \u2014 of $5.9 billion more than lawmakers had assumed last summer. The governor has asked legislators to put an extra payment of $2 billion into reserves or debt repayment rather than commit it to new programs or an expansion of existing ones.\n\n\u201cIf we are to minimize the zigzag of spend-cut-spend that this tax system inevitably produces,\u201d Brown said, \u201cwe must build a very large reserve.\u201d\n\nWhether the governor can convince more liberal Democrats in the Legislature of that path forward remains unclear.\n\nBrown \u201ctakes most of the discretionary revenues off the table, rather than investing them in critical, critical services that will help create a shared prosperity,\u201d state Sen. Holly Mitchell (D-Los Angeles) said.\n\nPerhaps anticipating such criticism, the governor used his speech to tout several efforts that he said would lessen the impact of income inequality \u2014 including the new statewide minimum wage of $10 an hour and a tax credit for the working poor.\n\nGov.

See more videos\n\n\u201cIn the face of this growing inequality, California has not been passive,\u201d he said, arguing that the roots of the problem reach far beyond the state\u2019s borders.\n\nEven so, some Democratic lawmakers criticized Brown for not speaking to the needs of Californians like low-income seniors and those who are developmentally disabled. And others said a glaring omission was what to do about residents who increasingly are priced out of owning a home.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a housing crisis in California, and there wasn\u2019t a word about housing,\u201d state Sen. Mark Leno (D-San Francisco) said.\n\nSIGN UP for the free Essential Politics newsletter >>\n\nBrown veered from his broad rhetoric at two specific points in his speech to urge an end to the legislative logjam over new revenues for healthcare funding and transportation \u2014 a situation created in part because his tax and fee proposals require a super-majority vote in both houses of the Legislature.\n\nDemocrats and Republicans should simply \u201cbite the bullet\u201d and agree to the new revenues, he said.\n\nBut Assembly GOP Leader Chad Mayes of Yucca Valley called it a \u201cfundamentally flawed\u201d premise to assume that new taxes were a prerequisite on either issue.\n\n\u201cWe want a seat at the table,\u201d Mayes said of negotiations over revamping an existing $1-billion tax on health insurance companies. \u201cWe\u2019re going to continue to have those conversations with the administration and with Democrats in the Legislature, but the details matter.\u201d\n\nFinding consensus on issues that extend beyond the immediate politics also remains tough in Sacramento.\n\nThe governor only briefly referred to his controversial plan to build underground tunnels to transport water around the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, and was silent on the funding troubles and political opposition facing the state\u2019s high-speed rail project.\n\nGov.

Jerry Brown delivers his State of the State address before a joint session of the California Legislature in Sacramento on Thursday. (Brian van der Brug / Los Angeles Times) (Brian van der Brug / Los Angeles Times)\n\nThe lack of new proposals in the State of the State address \u2014 in contrast to grand pronouncements offered by Brown\u2019s immediate predecessors \u2014 may align with the general principles of legislative leaders, who for the most part stand with the Brown administration\u2019s governing philosophy.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of work before us,\u201d Senate leader Kevin de Le\u00f3n (D-Los Angeles) said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be driven by big policy pronouncements.\u201d\n\nThe governor seemed to acknowledge that there was plenty to keep lawmakers occupied through the end of his term in 2018 in a joke he made in the early moments of Thursday\u2019s speech.\n\n\u201cThree more years to go,\u201d Brown said. \u201cThat is, unless I take my surplus campaign funds and put a ballot initiative on the November ballot to allow four-term governors to seek a final, fifth term!\u201d\n\njohn.myers@latimes.com\n\nTimes staff writers Melanie Mason and Christine Mai-Duc contributed to this report\n\nFollow @johnmyers on Twitter and sign up for our daily Essential Politics newsletter\n\nMORE\n\nGov.
