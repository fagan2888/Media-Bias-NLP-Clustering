The goal of such an expansion, the report says, is for Stanford \u201cto support an expansion of its health plan.\u201d\n\nreached across San Francisco Bay to acquire ValleyCare, based in Pleasanton.

Sutter Health, meanwhile, is consolidating its own operations. The foundation\u2019s report cites multiple rounds of reorganization over the past few years, and says Sutter now is attempting to merge its three Bay Area foundations with the goal of extending the successful Palo Alto Medical Foundation model to other sites. But the analysts predict that will be a tall order, given the foundations\u2019 different \u201chistories and physician cultures.\u201d\n\nAnd what of patients? Ha Tu, senior health researcher of Mathematica Policy Research and lead author of the study, predicts the increasing consolidation, \u201cat least in the short term, will result in more provider competition and more choices for consumers, but over the longer term, it remains to be seen whether it\u2019s a sustainable thing.\u201d\n\nGlenn Melnick, a health economist at USC, flatly rejects that the consolidation will ever benefit consumers.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happening,\u201d he said, \u201cis they\u2019re getting together to negotiate contracts, and that\u2019s it. I\u2019m very cynical.\u201d\n\nNorthern California as a whole has long had higher health care prices than Southern California. Melnick described \u201cmonstrous health care enterprises who are just building on existing market power to expand and protect it in the future.\u201d\n\nBoth the foundation\u2019s Shannon and lead author Tu stressed that future cost savings are unknown. While more consolidation can lead to higher prices, efficiencies can improve, Shannon said, but she added it\u2019s not clear now if those efficiencies would be robust enough to offset price hikes.\n\nTu pointed to a desire by many health systems to be more competitive against health giant Kaiser.\n\nAt both Sutter and UCSF/John Muir \u201cthey are very well aware they need to lower their cost structures significantly and do population health effectively,\u201d Tu said in reference to the push to move away from fee-for-service medicine, which can lead to unnecessary care and waste. \u201cWhether they can do that is a big challenge and an open question.\u201d\n\nIn the report, analysts also looked at safety net providers and the challenge posed by increased demand as millions more Californians have coverage, in the wake of the full implementation of the Affordable Care Act. Just over one-third of Californians are now covered by Medi-Cal, and primary care providers are in short supply, the report said.\n\n\u201cThe primary care physicians that are needed to serve that population just don\u2019t exist,\u201d Shannon said. \u201cWhat we need are innovative ways of meeting the health care needs of that population.\u201d\n\nProviding behavioral health care to patients in the face of expanded health insurance access and regulations requiring coverage \u201cparity\u201d \u2014 that health insurers must provide equal coverage for mental health conditions \u2014 is an \u201cenormous problem,\u201d Shannon said, and many patients are facing long wait times to access care.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a significant problem,\u201d she said, \u201cand it\u2019s long been simmering, it\u2019s been below the surface for a long time, and now parity has brought it up to the top.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "New report shows increasingly regionalization may lead to short-run cost savings.
