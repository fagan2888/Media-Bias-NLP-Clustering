The new rehabilitation hospital is expected to open in 2015, officials said.\n\nBoth Cedars\u2013Sinai and UCLA Health System provide their own acute inpatient rehabilitation services at their facilities, but both often reach capacity. The new inpatient rehabilitation center will not only serve those residents but also will treat complex rehabilitation cases from around the nation, including those with spinal cord injuries, brain injuries, strokes, amputations, neurological disorders, and musculoskeletal and orthopedic conditions.\n\n\u201cAs one of the most highly respected academic medical centers and health systems in the world, UCLA is delighted to join forces and share expertise with Cedars\u2013Sinai and Select Medical, a pre-eminent provider of post\u2013acute care in the United States,\u201d Dr. David T. Feinberg, president of UCLA Health System, said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThe addition of this rehabilitation facility will be of extraordinary benefit to the people of Los Angeles.\u201d\n\nThomas M. Priselac, president and CEO of Cedars\u2013Sinai Health System, agreed, adding that the project symbolizes Cedars-Sinai\u2019s mission.\n\n\u201cMeeting the health needs of the community, state and nation often requires a new type of partnership, and we look forward to working with UCLA Health System and Select Medical to create a highly advanced, comprehensive rehabilitation center for patients,\u201d Priselac said.\n\nThe new facility will be operated by Select Medical, a provider of long-term acute care services with hospital and outpatient locations in 44 states.\n\n\u201cUCLA Health System and Cedars\u2013Sinai are two pillars in medicine, and we are honored to work with them,\u201d said David S. Chernow, president of Select Medical.\n\nSuch partnerships will likely become common as the Affordable Care Act moves forward, said Jennifer Bayer, spokeswoman for the Hospital Association of Southern California.\n\nEarlier this year, City of Hope and Providence Health & Services, Southern California, announced their intent to pursue a partnership to expand cancer research and treatments to communities served by Providence, for example.\n\nOne provision under the Affordable Care Act, for example, is for hospitals to reduce readmission rates, or face penalties from Medicaid.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI think this (UCLA-Cedars-Sinai partnership) in particular is very unique because they are taking over a former hospital, so this will have an impact on jobs and patient services,\u201d Bayer said. \u201cI think the greatest thing is there are new beds and these beds are in demand.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Cedars\u2013Sinai, the UCLA Health System and Select Medical have formed a partnership to open a 138-bed acute inpatient rehabilitation hospital in Century City, officials announced Tuesday.The new facility will be housed inside what was once", "title": "Cedars-Sinai and UCLA join forces to open rehab hospital", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailynews.com/business/20131203/cedars-sinai-and-ucla-join-forces-to-open-rehab-hospital", "image": {"width": "512px", "identifier": "http://local.dailynews.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/small/dailynews_new.png", "height": "512px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Cedars-Sinai and UCLA join forces to open rehab hospital"}, "twitter": {"domain": "dailynews.com", "description": "Cedars\u2013Sinai, the UCLA Health System and Select Medical have formed a partnership to open a 138-bed acute inpatient rehabilitation hospital in Century City, officials announced Tuesday.The new facility will be housed inside what was once", "title": "Cedars-Sinai and UCLA join forces to open rehab hospital", "url": "http://www.dailynews.com/business/20131203/cedars-sinai-and-ucla-join-forces-to-open-rehab-hospital", "image": {"src": "http://local.dailynews.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/small/dailynews.png?052016"}, "site": "@ladailynews", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id551745144", "iphone": "id502957174", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.ladailynews"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "keywords": "Hospital and clinic services, Hospital and clinic services news, Los Angeles Hospital and clinic services news, CA Hospital and clinic services news, US Hospital and clinic services news, world Hospital and clinic services news.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Hospital and clinic services, Hospital and clinic services news, Los Angeles Hospital and clinic services news, CA Hospital and clinic services news, US Hospital and clinic services news, world Hospital and clinic services news."}, "article_summary": "Cedars\u2013Sinai, the UCLA Health System and Select Medical have formed a partnership to open a 138-bed acute inpatient rehabilitation hospital in Century City, officials announced Tuesday.\nBoth Cedars\u2013Sinai and UCLA Health System provide their own acute inpatient rehabilitation services at their facilities, but both often reach capacity.\nThe new rehabilitation hospital is expected to open in 2015, officials said.\n\u201cUCLA Health System and Cedars\u2013Sinai are two pillars in medicine, and we are honored to work with them,\u201d said David S.
