The nonprofit Partners in Health has started mentorship programs in countries like Rwanda and Haiti that aim to \"raise the standard of care by raising the standard of nursing,\" FierceHealthcare previously reported. Whether stateside or abroad, such initiatives are backed up by research that links nurse performance as well as nurse-physician collaboration to better clinical outcomes.\n\nFor its part, the AACN has invested more than $1.25 million over the past three years in the CSI Academy project, which allows graduates to showcase their work at healthcare conferences and in talks with hospital executives and nursing schools. AACN surveys also indicate that many nurses sustained or expanded their quality improvement initiatives after graduating from the program.\n\nEven with programs like AACN's, however, nurses face significant barriers to climb the ranks of hospital leadership, leaving them underrepresented in many C-suites, FierceHealthcare has reported.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- here's the announcement\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nTo improve healthcare outcomes, empower nurses\n\nHow hospitals can reduce barriers to nurse leadership\n\nNurses: The biggest factor in providing better care?\n\nExpanded scope of practice may boost patient outcomes, transition to value-based care\n\n3 must-have skills for physician, nurse leaders\n\nStudy credits nurse work environment for better outcomes", "article_metadata": {"description": "\u200bCritical care nurses who participated in 16-month leadership and innovation training program developed initiatives that helped their hospitals save an anticipated $28 million a year and significantly improve clinical outcomes,\u00a0according to\u00a0the American Association of Critical Care Nurses.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "\u200bCritical care nurses who participated in 16-month leadership and innovation training program developed initiatives that helped their hospitals save an anticipated $28 million a year and significantly improve clinical outcomes,\u00a0according to\u00a0the American Association of Critical Care Nurses.", "title": "Nurse leadership program helps hospitals cut costs, improve outcomes", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/nurse-leadership-program-helps-hospitals-cut-costs-improve-outcomes/2015-04-16", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "American Association of Critical Care Nurses,Care Delivery,CSI Academy,healthcare-acquired infections,HR & Workforce Management,nurse leadership roles,Patient Care & Outcomes,Preventable Medical Errors", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,HR & Workforce Management,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe46a9\"", "article_summary": "\"These outcomes solidly reaffirm the value of investing in bedside nurses' leadership development,\" AACN CEO Dana Woods said in an announcement.\nExpanded scope of practice may boost patient outcomes, transition to value-based care3 must-have skills for physician, nurse leadersStudy credits nurse work environment for better outcomes\nTo learn more:- here's the announcementRelated Articles:To improve healthcare outcomes, empower nursesHow hospitals can reduce barriers to nurse leadershipNurses: The biggest factor in providing better care?\nWhether stateside or abroad, such initiatives are backed up by research that links nurse performance as well as nurse-physician collaboration to better clinical outcomes.\nCritical care nurses who participated in a 16-month leadership and innovation training program developed initiatives that helped their hospitals save an anticipated $28 million a year and significantly improve clinical outcomes, according to the American Association of Critical Care Nurses (AACN)."}
