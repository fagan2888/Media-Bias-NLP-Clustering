Kaitlyn raised her steer for the past year. It was judged, weighed and auctioned off at the National Western Stock Show. ( Matthew Jonas )\n\nIf you go The National Western Stock Show runs through Jan. 26. For more information, visit nationalwestern.com.\n\nWhen the 644-pound steer arrived on a stock truck in May, Kaitlyn Faye called him El Diablo -- \"the devil\" in Spanish.\n\nBut by last weekend, when she left her family's Longmont ranch to show him at the National Western Stock Show in Denver, the Angus/Hereford cross had a new name.\n\n\"Now, I call him Gonzo,\" said Kaitlyn, 13. \"My horse's name is Kermit, like Kermit the Frog, and I just wanted a Muppets theme.\"\n\nKaitlyn Faye, 13, brushes her steer Gonzo during her daily chores at her home near Firestone. ( Matthew Jonas )\n\nKaitlyn and Gonzo both placed during last Sunday's livestock competition. She took 10th place in the junior Catch-A-Calf showmanship's class 100, and he ranked seventh in his live evaluation for Catch-A-Calf general entries class 100D, according to the Stock Show's online results.\n\nLater this week, the Denver slaughterhouse that bought him as a 1,364-pound market steer will cut her a check.\n\nBut the real payoff came from learning how to make him safe to show, she said.\n\nCowgirl adventures\n\nThe adventure began on a whim, when the 91-pound Sunset Middle School student followed her older brother to enter last January's Catch-A-Calf Contest.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nForty calves weighing between 200 pounds and 400 pounds ran helter-skelter in the arena during the Stock Show event while twice as many 4-H Club members, ages 12 to 18, from Colorado, Wyoming, Nebraska and Kansas chased them.\n\nAgainst all odds, the slight girl caught a token calf and later got a yearling sponsored by The Boettcher Foundation in Denver and delivered to her door to raise for the 2014 Stock Show.\n\nFaye began her cowgirl adventure to gentle and grow the steer by digging 4-foot deep holes for 8-foot poles. She used them to anchor a makeshift squeeze chute, a narrow space that made it safer to feed, groom and doctor the half-wild animal fresh off a sprawling Wyoming ranch.\n\n\"Nobody had touched him before Kaitlyn, and he was unpredictable around people,\" Michelle Faye, Kaitlyn's mother, said.\n\nFor this reason, Kaitlyn began halter-breaking Gonzo this summer by tying him to the family's tractor and driving slowly around their property.\n\nShe knew that she needed to feel comfortable leading him with a halter and show stick and bathing and brushing him by Stock Show time.\n\n\"But getting a better relationship with him was hard because at first he knew nothing about me, I knew nothing about him, and we were both afraid of each other,\" Kaitlyn said. \"It took time, and it took courage.\"\n\nBarn business\n\nWhile her progress in gentling the steer waxed and waned, the bills related to his care kept coming -- something her record book shows.\n\nIt documents vet, farrier and feed receipts to help her drill down to the cost of bringing a steer to market.\n\nEntries recounted Gonzo's escape in August to a nearby alfalfa field and treatment for possible bloating. In September, the book shows that the vet cared for an abscess on his jaw.\n\nKaitlyn Faye, 13, brushes her steer, Gonzo, during her daily chores at her home near Firestone. She took 10th place in the junior Catch-A-Calf showmanship s class 100, and he ranked seventh in his live evaluation for Catch-A-Calf general entries class 100D, according to the Stock Show s online results. ( Matthew Jonas )\n\nKaitlyn also documented the farrier's visit this fall, which began with loading Gonzo into a special cage and then rotating the steer 90 degrees off the ground to safely and conveniently trim his hooves.\n\nHowever, the biggest stack of receipts came from feed stores.\n\nGonzo gobbled 35 pounds of hay and two scoops of grain daily to gain 2 to 3 pounds every day just before the Stock Show, she said.\n\nTracking his weight gain and calculating the cost per pound of feed, depending on both vender and the volume bought, gave her data to share in her monthly letters to her sponsor. She also used it for talking points during her interview with Catch-A-Calf Contest judges this month.\n\nFor all of these reasons, the Denver-based Boettcher Foundation considers the process educational and has underwritten the cost of at least one calf every year since the Catch-A-Calf Contest debuted in 1935, said Tim Schultz, the foundation's president and executive director.\n\nBut when it comes to her yardstick for success, Kaitlyn reflects on the warm fuzzies.\n\n\"By the end, when I was filling the water tank, he would rub my leg until I give him pets,\" she said.\n\nPam Mellskog can be reached at Mellskog@msn.com or 303-746-0942.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.timescall.com/lifestyles-top-stories/ci_24929448/year-later-longmont-girl-places-catch-calf-steer", "modificationDate": "2014-01-18T21:44:40-0700", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2014/0116/20140116__19tcclif1_300.jpg", "sailthru.author": "By Pam Mellskog Longmont Times-Call", "description": "When the 644-pound steer arrived on a stock truck in May, Kaitlyn Faye called him El Diablo -- \"the devil\" in Spanish.", "ag": {"canon": "LongmontTimes-Call:article:24929448:view"}, "startDate": "2014-01-18T21:42:45-0700", "og": {"url": "http://www.timescall.com/lifestyles-top-stories/ci_24929448/year-later-longmont-girl-places-catch-calf-steer", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2014/0116/20140116__19tcclif1.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "When the 644-pound steer arrived on a stock truck in May, Kaitlyn Faye called him El Diablo -- \"the devil\" in Spanish.", "title": "A year later, Longmont girl places with Catch-A-Calf steer at the National Western Stock Show"}, "twitter": {"domain": "timescall.com", "description": "When the 644-pound steer arrived on a stock truck in May, Kaitlyn Faye called him El Diablo -- \"the devil\" in Spanish.", "title": "A year later, Longmont girl places with Catch-A-Calf steer at the National Western Stock Show", "url": "http://www.timescall.com/lifestyles-top-stories/ci_24929448/year-later-longmont-girl-places-catch-calf-steer", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2014/0116/20140116__19tcclif1.jpg", "site": "@TimesCall", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-01-18T21:42:45-0700", "sailthru.site": "timescall.com", "endDate": "2024-01-16T18:05:27-0700", "sailthru.title": "A year later, Longmont girl places with Catch-A-Calf steer at the National Western Stock Show", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Lifestyles: Top Stories", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "google-site-verification": "lLtD9ZooxmJUEEdRSCVzkO06t_hYKtyDqZF7EA3N2U0", "byline": "By Pam Mellskog", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2014/0116/20140116__19tcclif1.jpg", "pubDate": "2014-01-18T21:44:55-0700"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbd94\"", "article_summary": "Kaitlyn Faye, 13, works with her Catch-A-Calf steer Gonzo during her daily chores Jan. 8 at her home near Firestone.\nWhen the 644-pound steer arrived on a stock truck in May, Kaitlyn Faye called him El Diablo -- \"the devil\" in Spanish.\nKaitlyn Faye, 13, brushes her steer Gonzo during her daily chores at her home near Firestone.\nKaitlyn Faye, 13, brushes her steer, Gonzo, during her daily chores at her home near Firestone.\n( Matthew Jonas )If you go The National Western Stock Show runs through Jan. 26."}
