If elected, Quinn, 47, would be the first woman and first openly gay mayor. She has had an astonishing climb up the ladder, from housing advocate to City Council speaker. Her close working relationship with Mayor Bloomberg has helped and haunted her. It\u2019s enabled her to get things done, but some voters won\u2019t forgive her for agreeing to repeal term limits. Supporters adore her but opponents are fierce. An \u201cAnyone but Quinn\u201d group is fighting to defeat her.\n\nBIG IDEA: Building 80,000 units of affordable housing.\n\nWHAT\u2019S SHE LIKE: Her boisterous laugh when she\u2019s in a good mood \u2014 and her famous temper when she\u2019s not.\n\nSTAR POWER: Endorsed by actresses Whoopi Goldberg and Lorraine Bracco, fashion guru Tim Gunn and gay rights advocate Edith Windsor.\n\nRELATED: CELEBRITIES TURN OUT FOR NYC MAYORAL CANDIDATES\n\nAaron Showalter/New York Daily News\n\nANTHONY WEINER\n\nWHO IS HE? Weiner, 49, began his career as an aide to Sen. Chuck Schumer. He served in the City Council and spent a dozen years in Congress, gaining attention for defending Obamacare and his cable TV appearances. Backed out of 2009 mayoral run when Bloomberg sought a third term \u2014 and dropped out of Congress in 2011 because of a sexting scandal. Was riding high in polls before new sexting allegations emerged in July.\n\nBIG IDEA: Universal health care for New Yorkers through a single-payer system; \u201coligarch tax\u201d on sale of expensive apartments.\n\nWHAT\u2019S HE LIKE: He had a shouting match with a heckler, hammed it up at parades.\n\nSTAR POWER: His wife, Huma Abedin, stumped for him before new sexting revelations. Schoolteacher mom Frances stars in TV ad for him.\n\nRELATED: ANTHONY WEINER IN 'DREAM' ROLE AS TV WEATHERMAN\n\nEDUARDO MUNOZ/REUTERS\n\nBILL de BLASIO\n\nWHO IS HE? De Blasio, 51, was an aide to then-Mayor David Dinkins, worked at the Department of Housing and Urban Development and managed Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2000 Senate campaign before becoming a city councilman and public advocate. His anti-Bloomberg message and depiction of New York as a \u201cTale of Two Cities\u201d has resonated with voters, but rivals paint him as a flip-flopper on term limits and other issues. Has showcased his multiracial family, especially his Afro-wearing son Dante, earning points with black voters.\n\nBIG IDEA: Hiking taxes on New Yorkers earning over $500,000 a year to pay for pre-K and after-school programs.\n\nWHAT\u2019S HE LIKE: At 6-foot-5, could be tallest mayor ever.\n\nSTAR POWER: Endorsed by celebs Alec Baldwin, Harry Belafonte, Cynthia Nixon and Susan Sarandon.\n\nRELATED: BILL DE BLASIO ALL ABOUT BEING UNLIKE MIKE\n\nAnthony DelMundo/New York Daily News\n\nBILL THOMPSON\n\nWHO IS HE? The son of a prominent judge, Thompson, 60, has been a fixture in New York politics as president of the old Board of Education and city controller. He ran against Bloomberg in 2009 and came within five percentage points of beating the billionaire mayor, who spent $102 million to win. He then receded from public life, taking a $700,000-a-year job at investment bank Siebert Brandford. He has struggled to define himself to voters this year.\n\nBIG IDEA: Longer school days; expanded pre-K system.\n\nWHAT\u2019S HE LIKE: Sober. Has attempted to show fire in the belly with not one but two 24-hour campaign swings.\n\nSTAR POWER: Endorsed by salsa star Willie Colon, union boss Randi Weingarten, former Mayor David Dinkins and former Gov. David Paterson.\n\nRELATED: BILL THOMPSON 'HAS THE BEST BACKGROUND'\n\nMark Bonifacio/New York Daily News\n\nJOHN LIU\n\nWHO IS HE? Liu, 46, would make history as the city\u2019s first Asian-American mayor. He was a city councilman for eight years before being elected city controller in 2009. He has inspired immigrant communities \u2014 but his campaign has been dogged by a federal investigation of his fund-raising, and two former aides were convicted of conspiring to break campaign finance laws. The Campaign Finance Board denied him millions of dollars in public matching funds, crimping his candidacy. Calls himself the only true progressive running.\n\nBIG IDEA: Raise the minimum wage to $11.50 an hour.\n\nWHAT\u2019S HE LIKE: Tireless campaigner who pulls out all the stops. Once had two dancing Chinese dragons perform before his State of the City address.\n\nSTAR POWER: Endorsed by Sierra Club and District Council 37.\n\nRELATED: THE NEWS CYCLE: A CITI BIKE RIDE WITH MAYORAL CANDIDATE JOHN LIU\n\nAndy Kropa/Getty Images\n\nREPUBLICANS\n\nJOE LHOTA\n\nWHO IS HE? Lhota, 58, has spent his career hopping between the public and private sectors. He was a deputy mayor under Rudy Giuliani and was Giuliani\u2019s point man in a battle with Brooklyn Museum over a dung-covered painting of the Virgin Mary, a role he now says he regrets. Worked as an executive for Cablevision and Madison Square Garden before Gov. Cuomo appointed him to run the MTA, where he won plaudits for getting the transit system up and running after Hurricane Sandy.\n\nBIG IDEA: Frames crime as the biggest quality-of-life issue and says maintaining stop-and-frisk policing is key to city\u2019s future health.\n\nWHAT\u2019S HE LIKE: Gained a following for his frank and funny Twitter feed, where he rooted for Yankees and sometimes admitting to imbibing \u201ctoo much wine.\u201d\n\nSTAR POWER: Backed by old boss Rudy Giuliani.\n\nRELATED: LHOTA AND CATSIMATIDIS BATTLE OVER 9/11, AND CATS\n\nMark Bonifacio/New York Daily News\n\nJOHN CATSIMATIDIS\n\nWHO IS HE? Born in Greece, the son of a busboy, Catsimatidis, 65, is the embodiment of the American dream, becoming a billionaire who owns the Gristedes supermarket chain, real estate and an oil refining company with 375 food marts and gas stations. A longtime donor to the Clintons and Gov. Cuomo, Catsimatidis has run a Bloomberg-style campaign, spending millions of his own money, but not as much as the wealthier mayor.\n\nBIG IDEA: Bringing a world\u2019s fair to New York; putting cops on tricycles to improve their mobility.\n\nWHAT\u2019S HE LIKE: Prone to quirky, off-the-cuff comments, as in, \u201cI have a love factor with the minorities.\u201d\n\nSTARPOWER: Endorsed by former Gov.
