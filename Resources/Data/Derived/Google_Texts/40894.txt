Eight years ago, the American people voted for change.

Instead we got a continuation of socialism for the rich: bailouts to Wall Street and the sell-out to insurance companies and Big Pharma known as Obamacare. We got a continuation of massive deficits and government gridlock. Our water is poisoned, our bridges are crumbling, our factories are closing. Our young people graduate from college with crushing debt. The prison-industrial complex grows.

Establishment politicians have lost their audience. We don't pay attention to Barack Obama, Mitch McConnell, Hillary Clinton, Chris Christie, Jeb Bush. They are yesterday's tired voices: blah-blah this and blah-blah that.

Donald Trump may change his positions as often as he changes his underwear, but voters have no doubt that a Trump presidency will not be the same old, same old. Trump will run the table against Hillary Clinton if the Democratic Party does not come to its senses and nominate Bernie Sanders.
