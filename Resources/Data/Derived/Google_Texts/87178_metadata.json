An NBC/Wall Street Journal poll out Thursday showed that a mere 24% of Americans have a favorable opinion of the Republican Party\u2013a historic low.\n\nKentuckian Deborah Wright struggled for 30 years to take care of herself without insurance. She avoided the doctor because she couldn\u2019t afford the cost.\n\n\u201cUsually if I had to go I\u2019d have to borrow the money,\u201d she told MSNBC. \u201cBut most of the time I didn\u2019t go.\u201d\n\nOnce, a kidney stone landed her in the hospital and she needed surgery. It took her two years to pay back a lender.\n\nOn Wednesday, a week after the government shutdown as Congress battled over Obamacare, the health care law made it possible for Wright to enroll in Medicaid.\n\nThis past week, at least 8,500 in Kentucky signed up for the approximately 60 healthcare plans available on the state exchange; 240 small businesses had enrolled to give their staff healthcare through Obamacare; another 7000 applications have been started, but not yet submitted.\n\n\u201cOur state\u2019s U.S. senators are simply ignoring the facts when they continue to insist that \u2018no one\u2019 in Kentucky wants the Affordable Care Act,\u201d Democratic Gov. Steve Beshear told MSNBC.\n\nKentucky has a poor bill of health overall: \u201cThe state ranks among the worst, if not the worst, in almost every major health category, including smoking, cancer deaths, preventable hospitalizations, premature death, heart disease and diabetes,\u201d Beshear wrote in a recent New York Times editorial in support of Obamacare.\n\n\u201cI was really excited!\u201d Wright said of the new insurance policy she has, free of charge, adding that her three kids\u2014and nine grandchildren\u2014are pleased that she\u2019ll be able to get preventative care. \u201cThey was all tickled when I told them!\u201d\n\nThe state\u2019s healthcare exchange, Kynect, has \u201cenrolled [Kentuckians] in new insurance plans at a rate of about 1,000 Kentuckians a day,\u201d Beshear continued. \u201cThe rush of our families and small businesses to enroll in Kynect demonstrates how enthusiastic Kentuckians are about obtaining affordable health coverage.\u201d\n\nKentucky\u2019s not alone\u201428,000 signed up in California and 40,000 enrolled in New York.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very excited,\u201d Kynect\u2019s head Carrie Banahan said of Kentucky\u2019s success. \u201cWe certainly didn\u2019t expect all of this overwhelming interest the first week.\u201d\n\nNearly 200,000 have browsed the site since Oct 1st.\n\n\u201cWe had thought that maybe we might receive a couple of hundred applications during the month of October. We had no idea it would be thousands of applications,\u201d Banahan said. \u201cWithin the first hour we had a thousand applications and we were down for six hours till we could obtain some additional servers.\u201d\n\nThe team added more servers on Day 1 when the surge of traffic crashed the application system for roughly six hours. They increased their processing power by 50%, and the applicants kept coming.\n\n\u201cWe believe it\u2019s because of all the pent-up demand here in Kentucky,\u201d Kynect spokeswoman Gwenda Bond told MSNBC, explaining that most people who have signed up were previously uninsured. \u201c17% of our population [is uninsured.]\u201d\n\nTeresa Fleming, the chief financial officer of a group of primary care facilities, Mountain Comprehensive Health, said her lobbies had been flooded with people signing up for the plans. Through a federal grant, she\u2019s now able to afford for three full-time Kynectors, or insurance agents trained to help enroll people in the health exchanges, in the lobby of her Whitesburg primary care facility.\n\n\u201cThe response has shocked us,\u201d Fleming said. \u201cWe think it\u2019s due to a lot of word of mouth\u2026I had a single dad who worked all his life in coal mines and just got laid off and didn\u2019t know how he was going to get insurance. We signed him up on Medicaid. He has three kids.\u201d\n\nWright said it took her about an hour to sign up for the plan, though Banahan said it\u2019s designed to take, on average, 20 minutes.\n\nKynect also has a $11 million advertising campaign behind it for 2013 and 2014, funding a bus tour, health fairs, and a series of educational ads. The ad series is animated, so they can regularly add characters. They recently added a young woman figure, targeted at appealing to the \u201cyoung invincible\u201d demographic, Bond said. Once they start seeing the demographics of the sign-ups, they plan to add more characters to appeal to the demographics they see absent from sign-ups.\n\nKynect is noticeably absent of all mentions of Obamacare and some reporters have even found Kentuckians embracing Kynect while dismissing Obamacare. But Banahan and Bond said people just want to know how it affects them and if it can help them.\n\n\u201cMost of the people that I have seen voice an opinion were more open to the idea than buying health insurance,\u201d Banahan said. \u201cPeople are confused, but they really just want to know how it affects them.\u201d\n\nAs for the fight over Obamacare that shut the federal government down? Kentucky\u2019s brand new healthcare system isn\u2019t hurting.\n\n\u201cIt has not,\u201d Banahan said. \u201cWe\u2019re fully funded\u2026That\u2019s what counts here in Kentucky.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "So wrong: Senators Paul and McConnell said citizens of their state \"weren't buying\" Obamacare.
