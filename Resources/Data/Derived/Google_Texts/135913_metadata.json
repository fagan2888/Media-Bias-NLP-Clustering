Morrison was 44.\n\nMorrison\u2019s rise and fall in the boxing world was punctuated by his 1996 suspension from the sport because of a positive diagnosis for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The hard-punching heavyweight, nicknamed The Duke, died Sunday of \u201crespiratory and metabolic acidosis and multiple organ failure,\u201d the Daily News reported. His wife Trisha also confirmed his death.\n\nDespite testing positive for HIV, Morrison denied the test\u2019s results, declaring the findings a work of a rival promoter and even a conspiracy organized by the government. He went on to fight three more times following the diagnosis, all of which he won, before retiring in 2008 and beginning a public health battle for his life.\n\nMorrison\u2019s prowess in the sport put him in the ring with boxing greats George Foreman and Lennox Lewis. He topped Foreman to claim the World Boxing Organization (WBO) title of Heavyweight Champion. In his bout with Lewis, Morrison fell in the sixth round.\n\n\"If Tommy was fighting today, he no doubt would be a world champion,\" Holden said. \"You have to look at who he was fighting in the `90s, the guys in that division were Tyson, Lennox Lewis, Riddick Bowe, Ray Mercer, George Foreman. There's no one with that talent today. Tommy would absolutely dominate if he were in his prime boxing today.\"\n\nThe twilight of Morrison\u2019s life saw the once star athlete bed-ridden, with what his mother, Diana Morrison, called \u201cfull-blown AIDS.\u201d His health problems compounded, according to a story written for ESPN.com last month, when doctors mistakenly left a 12-foot piece of surgical gauze in Morrison\u2019s chest for more than a week.\n\nHe went on to contract Guillain-Barre syndrome and Miller Fisher disease (a variation of that syndrome) \u2014 two disorders that enact serious, often paralyzing, damage to a person\u2019s nervous system. Holden commented on Morrison\u2019s unrelenting determination in the face of his illnesses.\n\n\u201cThat's the way Tommy took off after he was told he was HIV-positive,\" he said. \"When he first was told, I was taking him to seek treatment and to different doctors around the country. And then he started research on the Internet and started saying it was a conspiracy. He went in that direction and never looked back.\"", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "tommy morrison, heavyweight champion, boxing, 44, hiv, aids, dies", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Former heavyweight champion Tommy Morrison, 44, dies of organ failure after a battle with illness spanning nearly two decades.", "title": "Tommy Morrison, Former Heavyweight Boxing Champion, Dies At 44", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/tommy-morrison-former-heavyweight-boxing-champion-rocky-v-star-dies-44-255295", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/25/tommymorrison.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Former heavyweight champion Tommy Morrison, 44, dies of organ failure after a battle with illness spanning nearly two decades.", "title": "Tommy Morrison, Former Heavyweight Boxing Champion, Dies At 44", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/tommy-morrison-former-heavyweight-boxing-champion-rocky-v-star-dies-44-255295", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/25/tommymorrison.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/25/tommymorrison.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2013-09-02T13:57:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-25T11:42:37-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Former heavyweight champion Tommy Morrison, 44, dies of organ failure after a battle with illness spanning nearly two decades."}, "article_summary": "Tommy Morrison, former heavyweight boxing champion and co-star alongside Sylvester Stallone in Rocky V, died Sunday, said longtime promoter and close friend, Tony Holden.\nHe topped Foreman to claim the World Boxing Organization (WBO) title of Heavyweight Champion.\nIn his bout with Lewis, Morrison fell in the sixth round.\nMorrison\u2019s rise and fall in the boxing world was punctuated by his 1996 suspension from the sport because of a positive diagnosis for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).\nMorrison\u2019s prowess in the sport put him in the ring with boxing greats George Foreman and Lennox Lewis."}
