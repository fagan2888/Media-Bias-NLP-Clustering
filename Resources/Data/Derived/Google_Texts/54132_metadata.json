Fredon Mayor Carl Lazzaro is now vice president, after serving two terms as president, and Sussex County Freeholder George Graham, of Stanhope, has been re-elected as secretary/treasurer.\n\n\n\nThere are 26 municipalities within the organization that meet once a month to keep up-to-date on legislation and court decisions, disseminate information across municipalities, and explore shared services with one another, according to Whilesmith.\n\n\n\nDue to the wide range of communities involved in the league, Whilesmith hopes to hold the meetings, which take place on the second Wednesday of the month, at different locations throughout the county.\n\n\n\nShe said she also hopes this will encourage others to become more involved.\n\n\n\nOver the course of the next year, the league plans on holding seminars for guest speakers to discuss today\u2019s most prominent topics.\n\n\n\nWhilesmith wasted no time stepping into her new role.\n\n\n\nAt the end of the meeting, she handed out surveys regarding who they would like to see speak at upcoming seminars. Among the topics are government ethics, benefits and pension, the Affordable Care Act, and foreclosures.\n\n\n\nWhilesmith also hopes to learn from those who have been in the league for a long time.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe more experienced elected officials have been in positions for over a decade. They have a wealth of information that I look forward to learning from,\u201d Whilesmith said.\n\n\n\nUnder Sussex County\u2019s bylaws, the president of the league is elected for one year but may serve a maximum of two years.\n\n\n\nWhilesmith said she is grateful for the opportunity and is looking forward to working with the other municipalities.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s great to network with other communities and help one another,\u201d Whilesmith said.\n\n\n\nSign up to get our newsletter emailed to you every week!
