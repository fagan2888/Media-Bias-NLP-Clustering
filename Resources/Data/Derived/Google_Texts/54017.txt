About 3,000 athletes were taking part in the Ironman competition in Louisville Sunday, a day described with "absolutely fabulous" weather for the rugged sporting event, race coordinators said.

Ironman racers, their supporters and spectators took to social media to document the race's 2.4 mile swim, 112-mile bike ride and 26.2-mile run winding through Waterfront Park, Oldham and Henry Counties and the city of LaGrange.
