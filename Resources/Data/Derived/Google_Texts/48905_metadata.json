Today we are faced with both,\" the resolution stated.\n\nIt went on to reprimand McCain, who has served 27 years in the Senate, for \"a long and terrible record of drafting, co-sponsoring and voting for legislation best associated with liberal Democrats.\"\n\nThe resolution condemned McCain's role in helping to craft a bill that passed the Senate last year that would provide a pathway to citizenship for up to 11 million illegal immigrants, which the state Republicans called \"amnesty.\"\n\nAmong the other complaints against McCain in the resolution were his support for funding the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, and positions he has taken on gun rights.\n\nMcCain, 77, who has said he might run for re-election in 2016, was elected as a Republican to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1982 and to the Senate in 1986.\n\nPresident Barack Obama in 2008 defeated McCain, the Republican's nominee, in the race for the White House.\n\nThe subtitle to a 2002 autobiography McCain co-authored calls him a \"maverick,\" a moniker also used at the time by 2008 vice presidential nominee, Sarah Palin, and he has become known for his willingness to work across party lines.\n\nA representative for McCain could not be reached for comment.\n\nBut former Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona, also a Republican, told the Arizona Republic the vote as not representing the will of most Republicans.\n\n\"I've gone to dozens of these meetings and every now and then some wacky resolution gets passed,\" Kyl told the newspaper.\n\nAt the meeting, the state Republican committee members also voted their support for abolishing a 1913 amendment to the U.S. Constitution that enshrined direct election of senators by the public, said a spokesman.", "article_metadata": {"description": "At a statewide GOP meeting, members called McCain&#039;s behavior a &quot;great crisis or betrayal,&quot; in reference to his positions of immigration reform, Obamacare and gun rights", "og": {"url": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/arizona-republicans-censure-john-mccain-for-being-too-liberal/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/01/07/087a26d1-ae11-4791-b605-fd625683672d/thumbnail/1200x630/9d9cc450f215e6b9a173dac2c2f41ab8/460110353.jpg", "height": 630}, "type": "article", "description": "At a statewide GOP meeting, members called McCain's behavior a \"great crisis or betrayal,\" in reference to his positions of immigration reform, Obamacare and gun rights", "title": "Arizona Republicans censure John McCain for being too \"liberal\""}, "twitter": {"description": "At a statewide GOP meeting, members called McCain's behavior a \"great crisis or betrayal,\" in reference to his positions of immigration reform, Obamacare and gun rights", "title": "Arizona Republicans censure John McCain for being too \"liberal\"", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "cbsnewsapp://news/arizona-republicans-censure-john-mccain-for-being-too-liberal/", "iphone": "cbsnewsapp://news/arizona-republicans-censure-john-mccain-for-being-too-liberal/", "googleplay": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/arizona-republicans-censure-john-mccain-for-being-too-liberal/"}, "country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "CBS News", "iphone": "CBS News", "googleplay": "CBS News"}, "id": {"ipad": 334256223, "iphone": 334256223, "googleplay": "com.treemolabs.apps.cbsnews"}}, "site": "@CBSPolitics", "image": "http://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/01/07/087a26d1-ae11-4791-b605-fd625683672d/thumbnail/1200x630/9d9cc450f215e6b9a173dac2c2f41ab8/460110353.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"web": {"url": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/arizona-republicans-censure-john-mccain-for-being-too-liberal/"}, "android": {"app_name": "CBS News", "package": "com.treemolabs.apps.cbsnews"}, "ios": {"url": "cbsnewsapp://news/arizona-republicans-censure-john-mccain-for-being-too-liberal/", "app_name": "CBS News", "app_store_id": 334256223}}, "robots": "index, follow", "fb": {"app_id": 1536620209892267}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CBSPolitics"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbd16\"", "article_summary": "President Barack Obama in 2008 defeated McCain, the Republican's nominee, in the race for the White House.\nPHOENIX - Arizona Republicans on Saturday censured U.S.\nThe resolution passed by a voice vote at an Arizona Republican Party meeting of 1,600 committee members at a church in Tempe, Arizona, said Tim Sifert, a spokesman for the state organization.\nBut former Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona, also a Republican, told the Arizona Republic the vote as not representing the will of most Republicans.\nSenator John McCain, the party's 2008 presidential nominee, for a record they called too \"liberal,\" in a sign of continued distrust some party members in the state have for the so-called political maverick."}
