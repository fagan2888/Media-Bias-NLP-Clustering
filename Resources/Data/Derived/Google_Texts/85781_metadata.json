Remember the president saying it will not cost us one dime more? Doctor visits have gone up 10 percent, higher in some places. Hospital stays risen by 14 percent. Diagnostic testing has also risen.\n\nThe Medicare tax was first imposed on payroll checks in 1967. The president wants to give it to everyone, citizen or not, worker or not. I was always taught you have to earn something before you can have it. So if you never had Medicare taxes deducted from your paycheck, you shouldn\u2019t qualify.\n\nOn April 1, the Congressional Budget Office stated its original cost estimate will be $560 billion more. This estimate will rise significantly as the CBO first adjustments are always low. Imagine all the workers paying in since 1967 and someone who never worked receiving the same benefit. The White House wants to issue fines for people with no insurance. UnitedHealthcare, the nation\u2019s biggest health insurer, will cut its participation in Obamacare after losses of more than $1 billion in 2015 and 2016. Repeal this piece of garbage.\n\nLarry Oinas\n\nRead or Share this story: http://gbpg.net/2758uIH", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "It is costing more than the president said it would", "og": {"site_name": "Press Gazette Media", "description": "It is costing more than the president said it would", "title": "Repeal Affordable Care Act", "url": "http://www.greenbaypressgazette.com/story/opinion/readers/2016/05/08/repeal-affordable-care-act/84111924/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/greenbaypressgazette.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "It is costing more than the president said it would", "title": "Repeal Affordable Care Act", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/09bff51dc00c899197dd0742bf59eb97c959eb29/c=354-0-1770-1416&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/05/08/GreenBay/B9322081300Z.1_20160508113653_000_GIIEA8810.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@gbpressgazette", "site": "@gbpressgazette", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=883246918", "fb": {"app_id": 179406702077699}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "article_summary": "visit doctor (Photo: Getty Images/iStockphoto)SHAWANO - The Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, should of been called The We Don\u2019t Care Act.\nThe president wants to give it to everyone, citizen or not, worker or not.\nOn April 1, the Congressional Budget Office stated its original cost estimate will be $560 billion more.\nThe law itself is over 2000 pages, plus over 20,000 pages of regulations.\nRemember the president saying it will not cost us one dime more?"}
