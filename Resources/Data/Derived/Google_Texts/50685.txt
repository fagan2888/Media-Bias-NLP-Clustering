A building under construction appears to have been destroyed in a 2-alarm fire at the Sylvan Thirty housing and retail development in West Dallas.

The fire was burning for at least an hour. Bystanders described at first seeing the building on Sylvan Avenue completely engulfed in flames. By 5 p.m. firefighters seemed to have gotten the blaze under control, though smoke was still heavy. Firefighters have been battling a stiff wind.

Cathy Hamm saw the fire while driving with her husband on Fort Worth Avenue. There were so many emergency vehicles on the scene that she couldn’t drive by.

“The heat in the car was so frightening,” she said. “The debris was hitting the car and it scared me to death.”

Captain Linda Henry of Dallas Fire-Rescue said her department got the call at around 3:58 p.m. The building was completely engulfed when firefighters arrived.

The fire appears to have been started by welding, Henry said. One person was inside when at the time, but he got out safely, she said.

Because it was so windy, firefighters focused on stopping the spread of the flames. The fire was contained to one building, none of the surrounding apartments appeared to be damaged. The remains of the office building will need to be torn down, Henry said.

Cooper Smith Koch, a spokesman for Sylvan | Thirty said the fire was in two-story building that was going to house a restaurant and a yoga studio.

He said the fire should not affect the opening of the Cox Farms grocery store, which will open once the Sylvan Avenue construction is completed.

About 30 or 40 firefighters were involved in battling the blaze.
