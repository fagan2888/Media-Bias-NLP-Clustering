"We are excited to expand the individual health insurance quoting options for our brokers as a result of our new partnership with AgentCubed," said Tiffany Stiller, vice president, carrier relations. "We consistently look for partners that add value to our core product and service offerings, and this collaboration enhances BenefitMall Individual Exchange."

Along with utilizing the Agent Dashboard to track clients and cases, users will now be able to manage prospects with Lead Management tools. Brokers will also be able to quote senior products for those over the age of 65, as well as quote for individual ancillary products. Individual Exchange will feature a new calculator to help estimate healthcare subsidies that integrates with the Federal Exchange.

"BenefitMall is happy to add value to the businesses of our individual brokers," said Joe Bahun, regional vice president, central region of BenefitMall. "We are dedicated to providing services and tools that make the selling process effortless, and the enhancements to Individual Exchange will take brokers to the next level of quoting, tracking and training in this growing market."

BenefitMall Individual Exchange includes online quoting, tracking and training. Brokers can run quotes for their individual clients, or let them search for their own ideal coverage from the BenefitMall website. Users can also easily check the status of each proposal and follow up with prospects that have received a quote, but have not yet applied for coverage. Once each case is submitted, Individual Exchange allows brokers to follow its progress.

"We share BenefitMall's vision of simplifying and streamlining the broker experience and are thrilled to provide their brokers with the sales management tools necessary to be successful in the individual health insurance market," said Jeff Morgan, CEO of AgentCubed. "This partnership will give BenefitMall brokers the competitive advantage of utilizing a single platform to manage both clients and prospects as well as provide multi-product quotes and proposals to the consumer quickly and efficiently."
