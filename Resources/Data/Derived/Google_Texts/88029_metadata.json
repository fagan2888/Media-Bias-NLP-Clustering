The New Yorker offered a typically measured and thoughtful response: \u201cWhen the Taliban Meets Hobby Lobby,\u201d which was based on the extremely realistic premise that the Taliban would move to the U.S., set up a closely held corporation, and then file suit to avoid having to pay insurance coverage for polio vaccinations.\n\nThe essay drew a lot of amused response. \u201cWhat if the Taliban wanted to exercise its right to free speech?!?!?!?!\u201d mocked one reader on Twitter. \u201cSure, the 4th Amendment SOUNDS nice,\u201d wrote another. \u201cBut what if a cop pulled over Osama bin Laden driving down I-95?!\u201d\n\nStill, you can\u2019t blame people who lose an argument for getting upset. Unfortunately, they also tend to exaggerate. And to complain not only that the reasoning was wrong but that the decision will produce consequences so horrible we\u2019d all be better off letting an asteroid the size of Texas smack into planet Earth and kill everything but the roaches.\n\nThat was the reaction in many quarters after two Supreme Court rulings in favor of gun rights. After the high court struck down a District of Columbia handgun ban, Mayor Adrian Fenty predicted that \u201cintroducing more handguns into the District will mean more handgun violence.\u201d Atlanta Mayor Shirley Franklin agreed: \u201cThere is no question that this decision from the Supreme Court makes it harder for all mayors to keep their city safe,\u201d she warned. Chicago Mayor Richard Daley called the ruling \u201cvery frightening.\u201d The New York Times insisted that the Court had \u201call but ensured that even more Americans will die senselessly.\u201d\n\nTwo years later, the Supreme Court extended its District of Columbia v. Heller ruling in McDonald v. Chicago. Reaction? Lather, rinse, and repeat.\n\nYet none of those predictions turned out to be accurate. After the rulings, the national homicide rate kept falling, and as did violent crime overall, and large cities especially enjoyed some of the largest declines. But wait\u2014weren\u2019t 14 people killed by gunfire in Chicago last weekend alone? Sadly, yes. (Pertinent point: Two of them were gunned down by police officers.) But that headline overshadowed the fact that, overall, Chicago\u2019s homicide total has been trending down\u2014and last year reached a low it hadn\u2019t seen in half a century.\n\nA similar pattern played out after the Supreme Court\u2019s 2010 decision in Citizens United, which said the government could not prohibit the election-season distribution of a movie about Hillary Clinton just because it was produced by a corporation. Reaction from the left was hotter than thermite plasma.\n\nThe Court had given corporations the power to \u201coverwhelm elections,\u201d fumed the New York Times corporation. A commentator from another corporation (MSNBC) declared the case the worst ruling since Dred Scott, which upheld slavery. President Obama said Citizens United \u201cstrikes at democracy itself.\u201d Others called the ruling a \u201cconstitutional Frankenstein moment,\u201d a \u201ccorporate takeover,\u201d \u201cradical,\u201d \u201cabsurd\u201d and \u201cterrifying.\u201d Some progressives launched a campaign to rewrite the First Amendment. Really.\n\nHow did the predicted hostile takeover of democracy by corporate America turn out? In the aftermath of the 2012 elections, the Times reported: \u201cAmerican Crossroads, the super PAC founded by Karl Rove, spent $104 million in the general election, but none of its candidates won. The United States Chamber of Commerce spent $24 million backing Republicans in 15 Senate races; only two of them won. Sheldon Adelson, the casino mogul, spent $53 million on nine Republican candidates, eight of whom lost.\u201d It was, as the paper noted, \u201cA Landslide Loss for Big Money.\u201d\n\nOh.\n\nNevertheless, after the court ruled this year against aggregate contribution limits in McCutcheon v. FEC, the same parties made the same dire predictions about the same dire consequences that were sure to follow. Lather, rinse, and repeat.\n\nThen came Hobby Lobby, and the million or so predictions that future cases will lead to countless other religious exemptions from other federal mandates. Taliban Inc. is on the way!\n\nAnything is possible, and all the many horribles the Court\u2019s critics have hypothesized could come to pass. There\u2019s always a chance. Why, in a few years, the health care marketplace might look just as it looked in those dark, primitive days of \u2026 July 2011, a month before the Department of Health and Human Services issued its insurance-coverage mandates.\n\nIn that event, employees of large companies could find themselves in the same boat as\u2014well, employees of small companies. Businesses with fewer than 50 employees don\u2019t have to cover contraception. Or blood transfusions. Or immunizations, or emergency room care. In fact, small companies don\u2019t have to offer insurance at all.\n\nYet many do. Heck, for that matter, even Hobby Lobby covers contraception\u201416 kinds of it, excepting only four it considers contrary to the doctrines of faith. As a matter of fact, the AP reports, free birth control coverage is becoming the norm. Despite the Hobby Lobby ruling, \u201cbusiness groups and employee benefits consultants say they see little chance that employers will roll back contraceptive coverage.\u201d Imagine that.\n\nFunny how things work out, isn\u2019t it? Time and again, the Supreme Court expands the boundaries of liberty. Time and again, statists predict that the sky will fall, the seven seals of Revelation will be opened, dogs and cats will start sleeping together\u2014and then things will really start to go downhill. Yet time and again, the gloom and doom fail to materialize.\n\nMaybe freedom isn\u2019t quite so dangerous after all.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://reason.com/archives/2014/07/14/dear-liberals-stop-freaking-out-about-th", "type": "article", "site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Freedom isn\u2019t so dangerous.", "title": "Dear Liberals, Stop Freaking Out About the Supreme Court"}, "twitter": {"title": "Dear Liberals, Stop Freaking Out About the Supreme Court", "description": "Reaction to Supreme Court decisions generally falls into two\ncamps: (a) The court wisely followed the Constitution, legal\nprecedent, first principles, logic, and sensible jurisprudence, or\n(b) WE\u2019RE ALL GOING TO DIE!!!\nReaction B was on full view after the Hobby Lobby\ndecision, in which the Supreme Court held that some companies could\ncite religious objections to avoid complying with a federal\ncontraception mandate.
