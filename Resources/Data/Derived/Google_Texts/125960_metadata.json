You do not have health care. You do not have benefits,\u201d Zuniga was told during her Jan. 27 appointment at the hospital.\n\nShe had been led to believe her health care expired on Jan. 30, six months after her husband\u2019s injuries discharged him from service.\n\nShe organized the appointment in December after learning a mammogram and needle biopsy found a tumor. Doctors at the time said it was not malignant.\n\nZuniga still doesn\u2019t know how bad her medical condition, but she fears cancer is overtaking her body especially after she found another lump over her thyroid gland, she told KING-TV.\n\nUnable to have the either tumor removed on her own dime, she\u2019s waiting for new benefits with the Affordable Care Act to kick in.\n\n\u201cI feel scared. I\u2019ve got two daughters. I\u2019m a young woman and I want to live. That\u2019s all I think, every day when I take a shower, when I see it,\u201d Zuniga added.\n\nON A MOBILE DEVICE?
