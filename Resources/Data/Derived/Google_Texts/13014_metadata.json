The planning process will use a $100,000 grant from the Michigan State Housing Development Authority (MSHDA), with a stipulation that planning for the 13.5-acre property \u2013 south of Washtenaw Avenue \u2013 include consideration of affordable housing.\n\nWhen debate was cut short through a procedural move, Peterson criticized commissioners for not spending more time on the topic \u2013 though it had been discussed at length during the board\u2019s Feb. 5, 2014 meeting. Andy LaBarre (D-District 7), who is helping to lead the project and who serves as chair of the board\u2019s working sessions, indicated support for discussing it further at an upcoming session.\n\nPeterson also voiced concerns about a new Act 88 advisory committee, which resulted in a postponement of the first appointment to that group until March 19. The committee had been created at the board\u2019s Nov. 6, 2013 meeting, as part of a broader policy to help the board allocate revenues levied under Act 88 of 1913. No appointments have been made, however. The county levies the tax to fund economic development and agricultural activities, including Ann Arbor SPARK.\n\nAs he has in previous board discussions, Peterson expressed concern that the board was abdicating its responsibility to allocate funding. Other commissioners assured him that the committee will deliver recommendations, but the board retains authority for making the allocations.\n\nIn other action, the board gave authority to the Washtenaw County clerk/register of deeds office to reduce the fee for expediting marriage licenses under certain circumstances \u2013 from $50 to 1 cent. The vote came over dissent from Kent Martinez-Kratz (D-District 1), who argued that fees should be applied equally to all applicants \u2013 whatever the amount. He also didn\u2019t think the criteria for applying the waiver were clear. County clerk Larry Kestenbaum cited some examples of when this fee reduction might be used. As one example, he noted that the vital records office anticipates moving later this year to the space where the deeds office currently is, so the office will likely be closed for more than three days.\n\nKestenbaum also reported that last year, his office had anticipated that a lot of people would want to get married right away because of a possible change in the state\u2019s same-sex marriage law. He said he announced at that time that he intended to waive the fee, but \u201cmy authority to do that has been questioned.\u201d He subsequently looked at the state statute, which requires a fee to be set by the county board and charged \u2013 whether it\u2019s $5, or $50, or 1 cent. \u201cIt\u2019s your authority to do this,\u201d he told commissioners.\n\nDuring the Feb. 19 meeting, commissioners also gave final approval to create a new dental clinic in Ypsilanti for low-income residents, and heard public commentary regarding the importance of the GED (general education diploma).\n\nUpdates and communications included news that the Sharon Township board of trustees had passed a resolution urging the board to keep the road commission as an independent entity. At the county board\u2019s Oct. 2, 2013 meeting, commissioners had created a seven-member subcommittee to \u201cexplore partnerships and organizational interactions with the Washtenaw County Road Commission.\u201d State legislation enacted in 2012 opened the possibility of absorbing the road commission into county operations, which would give county commissioners direct control over funding and operations now administered by the road commission.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s unlikely that will happen. During a 2.5-hour meeting on March 1, the subcommittee voted to recommend that the duties and responsibilities of the road commission should not be transferred to the county board of commissioners. Alicia Ping (R-District 3), who chairs the subcommittee, told The Chronicle that she\u2019ll be bringing the recommendation to the board at its meeting on March 5.\n\nPlanning for Platt Road Site\n\nAt their Feb. 5, 2014 meeting, commissioners had given initial approval to a broad community planning process for the future of Platt Road property owned by Washtenaw County. The Feb. 19 agenda included a vote giving final approval to a set of recommendations made by a citizens advisory group.\n\nThe 13.5-acre site at 2260 and 2270 Platt Road formerly housed the juvenile center. The advisory committee, which was created by the board on Sept. 18, 2013 and met three times late last year, recommended that the county use a $100,000 grant from the Michigan State Housing Development Authority (MSHDA) to fund a community design process for the property.\n\nThe committee recommended that the county keep the property until a design process is completed, according to a committee report. Specifically:\n\nThe CAC identified through consensus a number of principles that could apply to the site including demonstration for green technologies and sustainable design, mixed use, mixed income including affordable and moderately priced housing, minimized parking spaces, alternative transit, varied types and forms of housing for people of different ages, an urban village, less impervious surface, lower auto footprint, integration with neighborhood, visionary design, draws people to the site, opportunities to grow businesses, and connections to County Farm Park. In order to fit into its surroundings, the final composition of this site should serve to transition from the commercial aspects of Washtenaw Ave., the residential aspects of the local neighborhoods and the natural aspects of the County Park facility. Finally, it should incorporate uses that reflect its value as a county property and bring the opportunity of use or value for all Washtenaw County residents.\n\nThe resolution directed the advisory committee to provide more detailed analysis and recommendations by Sept. 31, 2014.\n\nCommittee members are: Ron Emaus, Jeannine Palms, Vickie Wellman, Rob Burroughs, Amy Freundl, Pete Vincent, Christopher Taylor (Ann Arbor city councilmember), and Jennifer Hall (Ann Arbor housing commission director). Also serving on the committee were Washtenaw County staff members Meghan Bonfiglio of the county parks & recreation commission; Greg Dill, director of infrastructure management; and Mary Jo Callan, director of the office of community & economic development. County commissioners on the committee are Yousef Rabhi and Andy LaBarre, who both represent districts in Ann Arbor.\n\nDebate on the resolution at the board\u2019s Feb. 5 meeting had focused on a resolved clause that would commit the county to using a portion of the property for affordable housing. At that meeting and on Feb. 19, the board was acting on the assumption that including affordable housing was a condition of accepting the $100,000 planning grant from MSHDA. The grant is part of a $3 million federal grant awarded to the county in 2011 and administered by the county\u2019s office of community & economic development (OCED).\n\nA resolved clause stated:\n\nBE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Board of Commissioners directs the CAC to assist in hosting an intensive multi-day community design process to create a plan for the site, inclusive of affordable housing;\n\nHowever, Callan subsequently informed LaBarre via email on Feb. 27 that the $100,000 planning grant would not need to be repaid if the county decides not to use that property for affordable housing. From Callan\u2019s email:\n\nMSHDA, like HUD, typically has a claw back provision for funds that aren\u2019t used for their intended purpose. In this case, the purpose of the MSHDA funding is to match/complement the $3,000,000 competitive HUD Sustainable Communities Planning Grant awarded to the county in 2011, and more specifically for a community design process that will result in affordable housing. To our surprise, MSHDA recently informed us that, because the funds were awarded for professional services to conduct planning, as opposed to acquisition, we would not be required to pay them back if the community design process doesn\u2019t result in affordable housing development. MSHDA did reaffirm that the expectation to advance affordable housing as a part of larger community sustainability principles remains in place (though payback would not be required).\n\nIn her email, Callan included a reminder that the $3 million HUD grant clearly sets affordable housing as a priority, especially along the Washtenaw Avenue corridor. She included a copy of the grant application abstract in her email:\n\nWashtenaw County is the perfect case study to address social equity issues through affordable housing choices, transportation, economic opportunities and healthy food access. Washtenaw County, Michigan is applying for $3,000,000 in HUD Community Challenge Planning Grant (CCPG) funds as the lead applicant in collaboration with several municipalities, the State of Michigan, non-profit agencies, private businesses, and educational institutions. This project focuses on the urbanized areas of Washtenaw County, with the goal of removing barriers to create a coordinated approach to expanding existing affordable and energy efficient housing options and connecting them to job centers and healthy food through an enhanced multi-modal transportation corridor. Washtenaw County is primarily a rural county by land area. However, about 64% of the residents in Washtenaw County live in the urban core which runs from Ann Arbor (the largest City) to Ypsilanti (2nd largest City) connected by Washtenaw Avenue, a state trunk-line and business loop which runs seamlessly through Pittsfield and Ypsilanti Townships. This corridor is the busiest road in the County, with the greatest number and diversity of businesses, yet offers few housing options directly on the corridor and mostly low-density neighborhoods near the corridor. This proposed project would rectify the disparity between isolated segments of our community. It would provide a catalyst to set into motion renewed revitalization efforts with green building practices; increased energy efficiency and reduced housing costs in rental housing, and enhanced connections to job centers for low-income and working class residents by strengthening public transit and non-motorized options along the Washtenaw Corridor.\n\nPlanning for Platt Road Site: Public Commentary\n\nMarian Laughlin, a board member of Religious Action for Affordable Housing (RAAH), hoped that the county would move forward with the study of using a portion of the Platt Road property for affordable housing. She hoped the vote that night would initiate a community planning process \u201cthat will lead to the thoughtful development of this very central property.\u201d She knew the community advisory committee had discussed the issue, and she hoped that the conversation would become even broader to make people more aware of the issue and of how the county can contribute to increasing the affordable housing stock.\n\nLaughlin described RAAH as a group that worked through the religious congregations in the entire county to increase awareness about housing issues, and that raises funds to support agencies that create affordable and supportive housing. Her colleagues on the RAAH board had urged her to come and speak to commissioners in support of using part of the Platt Road property for affordable housing.\n\nYousef Rabhi (D-District 8) thanked Laughlin for her comments, and noted that he also serves on the RAAH board.\n\nPlanning for Platt Road Site: Board Discussion\n\nRonnie Peterson (D-District 6) asked for this item to be pulled out of the agenda for separate consideration. He said he appreciated the advocacy for affordable housing in the Washtenaw Avenue area. His concern was about the cost to the county. He asked for some explanation about what the next steps would be, saying he had several questions about the process.\n\nPeterson then criticized the previous board action to relinquish control of the Washtenaw Head Start program. [That decision was made in late 2011 after considerable debate. The Washtenaw Intermediate School District is now administering the local Head Start program.]\n\nCounty government should support programs that help children, Peterson said, as well as affordable housing. But the county should be involved in affordable housing through partnerships, he added \u2013 it shouldn\u2019t get into the affordable housing business. He said he supported Andy LaBarre\u2019s efforts on the Platt Road property, but he pointed out that the argument for stopping support for Head Start had been that it wasn\u2019t a core service for the county. The same is true for affordable housing, he noted.\n\nThe process being used on the Platt Road property circumvents the county\u2019s own policy regarding the disposition of property, Peterson said, and someone needs to make sense of that. He said he wasn\u2019t going to torpedo the proposal, but he had a lot of questions. Housing is more challenging than Head Start could ever be, he said.\n\nAs he\u2019s done in the past, Peterson suggested selling the Platt Road property and putting the proceeds into affordable housing initiatives. He preferred that approach.\n\nPeterson said he\u2019d like to hear what other commissioners had to say. It\u2019s a policy decision, he noted, so the board should discuss it.\n\nAt this point, Dan Smith (R-District) moved to call the question, a procedural move intended to force a vote. On a voice vote, the board voted to call the question, over dissent by Conan Smith (D-District 9). The board then voted on the item.\n\nOutcome: The board unanimously gave final approval to the Platt Road planning effort.\n\nLater in the meeting, Conan Smith (D-District 9) said he thought the issue of the county\u2019s role in affordable housing warrants a good discussion. The Platt Road advisory committee is doing good work, he added, but it does represent a shift in how the county does business. He suggested having a working session that focused on that issue.\n\nYousef Rabhi (D-District 8) agreed, noting that this is just the first step in a process of engaging the community. \u201cI think the board\u2019s dialogue needs to be parallel to the community\u2019s dialogue,\u201d he said. No one has proposed that the county build and run affordable housing, Rabhi said. If the county does decide to pursue affordable housing, it\u2019s a matter of partnering with other organizations, he said. The county wouldn\u2019t be able to do it alone.\n\nAndy LaBarre (D-District 7), who chairs the board\u2019s working sessions, said he\u2019d be happy to add this as a topic for a future working session. He agreed with Rabhi that the county isn\u2019t planning to run an affordable housing program. He emphasized that anything recommended by the advisory committee \u201cwould of course need board approval.\u201d\n\nLaBarre felt that some of the board\u2019s conversation was \u201ctalking about this as if it\u2019s happened\u201d \u2013 but it hasn\u2019t, he said.\n\nPeterson joked that he was pleased when Dan Smith had made the motion to approve the Platt Road planning project, because as a Republican, Smith had \u201cchanged his spots\u201d regarding the typical Republican stance toward affordable housing. \u201cHe\u2019s just as close to a Democrat as he can be tonight, and I\u2019m grateful for that,\u201d Peterson said.\n\nHe then referred to Smith\u2019s calling of the question, and described it as a \u201crude process to use.\u201d He noted that the board spent less than 10 minutes talking about the disposal of land that\u2019s worth at least $2 million \u2013 \u201cand six of those minutes I took up,\u201d he said. He cautioned against calling the question, when other commissioners still wanted to discuss the issue. He said if other commissioners wanted rude treatment, he was capable of that as well.\n\nThe property is worth millions of dollars, Peterson said, and deserves more discussion. If a developer is interested, he felt the board has basically closed the door on that possibility. \u201cLet\u2019s follow our policies \u2013 not by calling the question.\u201d\n\nPeterson concluded by saying he appreciated that Dan Smith supported this effort, adding that it was \u201cgood to have a Republican on our team.\u201d\n\nAppointments\n\nCommissioners were asked to approve several appointments to various county board and committees. Nominations were brought forward by board chair Yousef Rabhi (D-District 8). Several openings remain and will be reposted on the county\u2019s website.\n\nThe nominations made on Feb. 19 were:\n\nAct 88 Advisory Committee, for a term ending Dec. 31, 2014: Todd Clark.\n\nCommunity Action Board, for terms ending Dec. 31, 2016: Ivory Gaines (consumer); James Horton (consumer); Elizabeth Janovic (private sector); Jason Morgan (public sector).\n\nLocal Emergency Planning Committee, for terms ending Dec. 31, 2016: Daniel Barbossa (broadcast media); Samantha Brandfon (hospital); Linda Dintenfass (first aid).\n\nWashtenaw Community Health Organization (WCHO), for terms ending March 31, 2017: Mark Creekmore and Linda King (county representatives).\n\nWashtenaw County/City of Ann Arbor Community Corrections Advisory Board, for a term ending Dec. 31, 2016: Judy Foy (communications/media).\n\nSeveral openings remain, and have been reposted on the county\u2019s website. Those include:\n\nAct 88 Advisory Committee: One position for a resident with experience in agriculture and/or tourism.\n\nAgricultural Lands Preservation Advisory Council: One position for an environmental/conservation group/natural resource professional.\n\nCommunity Action Board: One position for a consumer slot.\n\nLocal Emergency Planning Committee: Several openings for people representing health and law enforcement (2), owner/operator of a Title III facility (2), firefighter (1), elected state official (1), first aid (1), civil defense for the city of Ann Arbor (1), transportation (1), print media (1), agricultural (1), and agricultural/Farm Bureau (1).\n\nWorkforce Development Board: Two openings for people in the private sector.\n\nAppointments: Board Discussion\n\nRonnie Peterson (D-District 6) asked for Todd Clark\u2019s nomination to the Act 88 advisory committee to be pulled out for a separate vote.\n\nOutcome on all appointments other than Todd Clark: The appointments were approved unanimously.\n\nPeterson recalled that the board had discussed the creation of an Act 88 advisory committee, but he\u2019d been under the impression that more details about it would be forthcoming.\n\nBy way of background, for the past few years the county has been levying a tax to fund economic development and agricultural activities, under Act 88 of 1913. The county\u2019s position is that it is authorized to collect up to 0.5 mills under Act 88 without seeking voter approval. That\u2019s because the state legislation enabling the county to levy this type of tax predates the state\u2019s Headlee Amendment. The amount levied by the county in December 2013 was 0.07 mills, raising about $972,000 to fund Ann Arbor SPARK, heritage tourism, and the Detroit Region Aerotropolis, among other entities.\n\nAs part of developing the 2014-2017 budget, the county board approved a new policy for allocating Act 88 revenues at its Nov. 6, 2013 meeting. The policy was drafted by Conan Smith (D-District 9). [.pdf of Act 88 policy] The policy included creating an Act 88 advisory committee to make recommendations to the board and prepare an annual report that assesses how Act 88 expenditures have contributed toward progress of goals adopted by the board.\n\nThe policy also allows the committee to distribute up to 10% of annual Act 88 revenues without seeking board approval. That was the subject of some discussion on Nov. 6, 2013, with Dan Smith (R-District 2) noting that Act 88 authorizes only the board to direct how revenues are spent. Corporation counsel Curtis Hedger had told the board that by approving this policy, commissioners would be providing that direction \u2013 in essence, delegating it to the advisory committee.\n\nThe policy also allocated up to 30% of revenues to the county office of community & economic development, which administers Act 88 funding. The Nov. 6 vote on the Act 88 policy was unanimous.\n\nDuring discussion on Feb. 19, Peterson said he didn\u2019t recall passing a resolution that gave criteria for the advisory committee in determining how to allocate the Act 88 revenues.\n\nYousef Rabhi (D-District 8) responded, saying that the resolution creating the Act 88 advisory committee stipulated that the membership would include three commissioners and two residents \u2013 one least on of them having a background in agriculture or tourism.\n\nSpecifically, the policy adopted in 2013 outlined these guidelines regarding the advisory committee:\n\nIII. Act 88 Advisory Committee a. An Act 88 Advisory Committee is created as a subcommittee of the Board of Commissioners and shall include three members of the Board as recommended by the Chair and approved a majority of the Board. The Committee shall have two additional residents of Washtenaw County, with at least one of those residents having expertise in agriculture and/or tourism. No recipients of Act 88 funds shall be a member of the Committee. b. The Advisory Committee is charged with annually reviewing applications and recommending funding for Act 88 funds and overseeing and evaluating funding recipients. c. As a committee of the Board of Commissioners, the Advisory Committee shall be governed by the Open Meetings Act. d. The Advisory Committee shall annually prepare and present to the Board of Commissioners a report summarizing expenditures of Act 88 funds and assessing progress towards the goals adopted by the Board of Commissioners. e. The Advisory Committee will annually recommend to the Board of Commissioners a process for evaluating applications that identifies priority outputs and includes a numerical scoring system for comparing applications. f. The Office of Community and Economic Development will staff the Advisory Committee.\n\nAs he has in previous board discussions, Peterson expressed concern that the board was abdicating its responsibility to allocate funding. He said he could see supporting the work of the advisory committee if it were to develop criteria for allocating funds, which the board could then discuss and use in its own decisions. But he didn\u2019t support having a committee that would receive grant applications on behalf of the board. He didn\u2019t care who was appointed to the committee \u2013 the responsibility for allocating funds still rested with the board.\n\nConan Smith responded, saying that it was never the intent for the advisory committee to take on the board\u2019s responsibilities. Rather, the role of the committee would be to recommend the criteria and priorities for allocating Act 88 funds, he said. The board would then need to adopt those criteria, Smith continued. The committee would then develop a scoring matrix, based on the board-approved criteria. After the board approved that scoring matrix, Smith said, the committee would collect applications from entities that seek funding, evaluate those applications, and make recommendations about which entities should receive funding. All of this would happen annually.\n\nThe board would retain complete control over those Act 88 funds, Smith said. To date, he noted, there hasn\u2019t been an application process for funding. \u201cI think that the committee has the potential to be very powerful and abuse its power, but I hope we put in enough oversight opportunities to make sure that doesn\u2019t happen,\u201d he said.\n\nPeterson replied that the process Smith described sounded good, but he wondered where that was codified. There should be a document that clearly explains the committee\u2019s charge, Peterson said, and that makes clear what the role of the committee is. Without that, he said he wasn\u2019t comfortable voting for the appointment to the Act 88 committee.\n\nSmith offered to amend the appointment resolution, incorporating the description of the committee that had been included in the policy passed by the board in November. His amendment included these elements as a charge for the committee: (1) annually reviewing applications and recommending funding for Act 88 funds and overseeing and evaluating funding recipients; (2) annually preparing and presenting to the board a report summarizing expenditures of Act 88 funds and assessing progress towards the goals adopted by the board; (3) annually recommending to the board a process for evaluating applications that identifies priority outputs and includes a numerical scoring system for comparing applications; and (4) recommending annual priorities for the use of Act 88 funds.\n\nPeterson stressed the importance of stating that it was an advisory committee. Smith proposed adding a sentence to the advisory committee\u2019s charge, stating that it\u2019s an advisory committee to the board of commissioners and that the committee won\u2019t be making decisions about the allocation of funds.\n\nOutcome on amendment: It passed unanimously on a voice vote.\n\nDan Smith (R-District 2) made a motion to postpone the item until the March 5 meeting. Rabhi noted that one of the Act 88 committee positions was being reposted, and he didn\u2019t expect a nomination would be made until March 19. So D. Smith withdrew his original motion, and moved to postpone until the March 19 meeting.\n\nOutcome on postponement: The motion to postpone Todd Clark\u2019s appointment to the Act 88 advisory committee until March 19 passed on a 5-1 vote, over dissent from Yousef Rabhi (D-District 8).\n\nMarriage License Fees\n\nA proposal giving authority to the Washtenaw County clerk/register of deeds office to reduce the fee for expediting marriage licenses under certain circumstances \u2013 from $50 to 1 cent \u2013 was on the Feb. 19 agenda.\n\nCurrently, the $50 fee is charged if applicants want to waive the statutory three-day marriage license waiting period. The resolution would authorize the county clerk, consulting with the county administrator, to establish a \u201dfee holiday\u201d on the day preceding a period during which the office\u2019s vital records division would be closed for four or more days, or when an unusual number of marriage license applicants are expected to appear. During a \u201cfee holiday,\u201d the charge for immediately processing a marriage license would be 1 cent.\n\nAccording to a staff memo, waivers of the waiting period are requested between 5-15 times each month. Without a waiver, marriage licenses cost $20 per couple for Michigan residents, and $30 per couple for out-of-state residents \u2013 but the marriage must occur within Washtenaw County. More information is available on the county\u2019s website.\n\nResponding to a follow-up query from The Chronicle, county clerk/register of deeds Larry Kestenbaum reported that marriage license revenue is about $40,000 annually. Last year, 1,938 licenses were issued, compared to 1,830 in 2012.\n\nMarriage License Fees: Board Discussion\n\nKent Martinez-Kratz (D-District 1) was concerned that by passing this resolution, the county board would be abdicating its responsibility for setting fees. He noted that the decision would be made by two individuals \u2013 the county clerk and county administrator. He said some of his constituents have indicated that the criteria for declaring a fee holiday are unclear. His sense is that this resolution was designed to help one particular group.\n\nCounty clerk/register of deeds Larry Kestenbaum came to the podium to respond. He told commissioners that when he came into office, the fee for waiving the three-day waiting period was $5, based on a resolution adopted by the county board. [Kestenbaum was first elected as clerk/register of deeds in 2004.] He subsequently recommended that the board raise that fee to $50, and the board did that, he said.\n\nIt\u2019s been the practice that when his office will be closed for a longer-than-normal period \u2013 like four days or more around the holidays \u2013 then his office would make some allowances for individuals who come in and want to get married before the office will reopen. He noted that the vital records office anticipates moving later this year to the space where the deeds office currently is, so the office will likely be closed for more than three days.\n\nKestenbaum said it\u2019s come to his attention that under state statute, he doesn\u2019t have the authority to waive that fee completely. The statute states that a fee, set by the county board, must be charged.\n\nKestenbaum was referring to this section of Michigan\u2019s Public Act 128 of 1887:\n\n551.103a Marriage license; time of delivery; solemnization of marriage required. Sec. 3a. A marriage license shall not be delivered within a period of 3 days including the date of application. However, the county clerk of each county, for good and sufficient cause shown, may deliver the license immediately following the application. If the county clerk delivers the license immediately following the application, the person applying for the license shall pay a fee to be determined by the county board of commissioners, which the county clerk shall deposit into the general fund of the county. A marriage license issued is void unless a marriage is solemnized under the license within 33 days after the application.\n\nSo in consultation with his staff and some commissioners, including the board chair Yousef Rabhi (D-District 8), Kestenbaum said they came up with the idea to instead impose a 1 cent fee under certain circumstances. The fee would be dropped to a penny when someone needed an expedited process, through no fault of their own, he said.\n\nKestenbaum said that several years ago he\u2019d asked to raise the fee for expedited processing to $50 because previously, people would just pay the $5 fee even if they didn\u2019t need a quick turnaround. \u201cThe $50 was designed so that people would at least think about it before asking for it,\u201d he said. Generally, people request an expedited process because they\u2019ve forgotten to get the license, and the wedding is being held before the three-day waiting period, he noted.\n\nThe other circumstance that might result in dropping the fee, which Kestenbaum said he didn\u2019t expect to happen, is when a larger-than-normal number of people apply for licenses at the same time. For example, last year, his office anticipated that a lot of people would want to get married right away because of a possible change in the state\u2019s same-sex marriage law. He said he announced at that time that he intended to waive the fee, but \u201cmy authority to do that has been questioned.\u201d\n\nHe subsequently looked at the state statute, which requires a fee to be set by the county board and charged \u2013 whether it\u2019s $5, or $50, or 1 cent. \u201cIt\u2019s your authority to do this,\u201d he told commissioners.\n\nAt this point, Kestenbaum expects that various legal challenges to same-sex marriage bans will wind their way through the federal court system, and there will either be a decision that affects every state, or not, he said. \u201cThere would be nothing unique about Michigan, in that circumstance,\u201d he said, \u201cand there won\u2019t be any anxiety that the court would change its mind.\u201d That means his office is unlikely to see a sudden influx of requests for same-sex marriage licenses.\n\nRealizing now that he doesn\u2019t have authority to waive the fee, Kestenbaum said, he\u2019s asking the board for these changes. He noted that the original draft had stated that a waiver would be made in consultation with the county board chair, but it had been suggested to him that the county administrator should be consulted instead, and he agreed to that change.\n\nMartinez-Kratz said Kestenbaum had answered some of his questions, but he didn\u2019t see the urgency to finalize the change that night. [Typically, resolutions are given initial approval at a ways & means committee meeting, on which all commissioners serve, and then the item is brought back for a final vote two weeks later, at a regular board meeting. This resolution was on the Feb. 19 agendas for both the ways & means committee and the regular board meeting that same night.]\n\nMartinez-Kratz said fees should be appropriate to the community as a whole, based on the same rationale for everyone. Setting the fees at $50 but waiving them to 1 cent sometimes is like \u201cping pong,\u201d he said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t sit right with me.\u201d He wasn\u2019t going to support the resolution, because he didn\u2019t think it wasn\u2019t setting fees appropriately for all members of the community.\n\nKestenbaum replied, saying that the overwhelming majority of people coming into the office to apply for a marriage license won\u2019t be affected by the fee waiver change. He said that the state statute would allow the county board to decline to set a fee for an expedited process. In that case, everyone would have to wait three days. \u201cI would be opposed to that,\u201d Kestenbaum said, \u201cbut that\u2019s within your authority.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s optional for the board of commissioners to set a fee, he added. But if there\u2019s a fee, his office must collect it.\n\nMartinez-Kratz reiterated that the problem for him is the non-standard way in which the fee could be applied. He wasn\u2019t concerned about the amount of the fee. \u201cBut you want the power from our board to at times assess it at $50 and at times assess it for a penny,\u201d Martinez-Kratz told Kestenbaum.\n\nKestenbaum noted that the board has the authority to adjust the fees based on \u201cadministrative practicalities.\u201d When someone is putting a burden on the office by needing the license to be typed, proofed and processed \u2013 and there\u2019s a line of people waiting behind them \u2013 then \u201cthe $50 fee is to inhibit them from asking for that casually,\u201d he said.\n\nConan Smith (D-District 9) said he totally agreed with the premise put forward by Martinez-Kratz. The fee should be set appropriately and used appropriately. But he heard from Kestenbaum that the actual cost of processing is more burdensome on the office when it\u2019s done arbitrarily and you can\u2019t plan for it, Smith said. So when the clerk\u2019s office can see in advance that there\u2019s likely to be an influx of license requests, the office can staff up appropriately for that. In that case, they shouldn\u2019t need to charge an \u201cexcessive\u201d fee, Smith said. It might happen after the office has been closed for a long period, he said, or it might be brought about by other circumstances \u2013 like people wanting to get married on Valentine\u2019s Day. Smith said he thought the fee structure was thoughtful and addresses these conditions.\n\nOutcome: The proposal was approved on two 5-1 votes at both the ways & means committee meeting and at the regular board meeting later that evening. In both cases, Kent Martinez-Kratz (D-District 1) cast the only dissenting vote. Three commissioners \u2013 Felicia Brabec (D-District 4) Alicia Ping (R-District 3), and Rolland Sizemore Jr. (D-District 5) \u2013 were absent.\n\nDental Clinic\n\nFinal approval for new dental clinic for low-income residents of Washtenaw County was on the Feb. 19 agenda. The project had received initial approval on Feb. 5, 2014.\n\nThe project is estimated to cost $1.5 million, using funds from the public health Medicaid liability account ($814,786), the public health fund balance ($663,015) and Washtenaw Health Plan ($50,000). According to the county\u2019s public health staff, 58,000 county residents either don\u2019t have dental insurance or on Medicaid dental insurance. However, only a few private dentists accept Medicaid. When up and running, the dental clinic is expected to serve 6,000 patients annually, including residents with income at up to 200% of the poverty level.\n\nIt\u2019s expected that federal matching funds would supplement Medicaid reimbursement rates to provide a sustainable long-term cash flow, according to a staff memo. [.pdf of staff memo]\n\nThe resolution authorizes contract negotiations with the nonprofit Michigan Community Dental Clinics Inc. to run the clinic and with St. Joseph Mercy Health System, which would contribute space at its Haab Building in Ypsilanti at little to no cost.\n\nStaff from the county\u2019s public health department attended the Feb. 19 meeting, but did not formally address the board.\n\nOutcome: Without discussion, the resolution was approved on a 5-1 vote over dissent from Dan Smith (R-District 2). Three commissioners \u2013 Felicia Brabec (D-District 4) Alicia Ping (R-District 3), and Rolland Sizemore Jr. (D-District 5) \u2013 were absent.\n\n\u201cPrescription for Health\u201d Grant\n\nA resolution on the Feb. 19 agenda was for initial approval to apply for accept a two-year $226,357 \u201dPrescription for Health\u201d grant from the Kresge Foundation. It will fund a part-time staff position and requires a $54,250 match from the county\u2019s public health department.\n\nThe county had previously received funding for this program, in the form of a two-year, $361,519 Kresge grant from Jan. 1, 2011 through Dec. 13, 2012. According to the program\u2019s website, the purpose is \u201dto increase fruit and vegetable consumption among patients with low income, and to build capacity of clinics to expand the traditional medical model to include the food system.\u201d The program also aims to strengthen relationships between clinics, farmers markets and the local food system. [.pdf of grant application]\n\nAccording to a staff memo, analysis of feedback from 930 participants in 2011-2012 showed the following results:\n\nBoth years, the average daily consumption of fruits and vegetables increased by nearly one cup per day among patients who visited their local farmers market as measured by a pre- and post-program survey. Participants overwhelmingly agreed that visiting the farmers market helped them and/or their family members eat more fruits and vegetables (96% Year 1; 94% Year 2). Participants increased their awareness of other resources in the community. Both years, the number of participants who said they were aware that food stamps (Bridge/EBT cards) could be used at local farmers markets greatly increased from pre- to post-program (48% difference from pre to post Year 1; 43% difference Year 2). Participants indicated that they were very likely to visit the farmers market again in the future at the conclusion of the program (98% Year 1; 97% Year 2). The program had a positive economic impact on the local farmers markets, generating over $26,000 in new sales ($5,967 Year 1; $20,279 Year 2). Prescription for Health represented 9% of total sales at the Downtown Ypsilanti Market and accounted for 23% of the total sales at the Chelsea Bushel Basket Market.\n\nOutcome: Without discussion, commissioners gave initial approval to this grant application. A final vote is expected on March 5.\n\nCommunications & Commentary\n\nDuring the Feb. 19 meeting there were multiple opportunities for communications from the administration and commissioners, as well as public commentary. In addition to issues reported earlier in this article, here are some other highlights.\n\nCommunications & Commentary: Gravel Mining\n\nYousef Rabhi (D-District 8) highlighted a proposal by McCoig Materials Inc. to do gravel and sand mining in Lyndon Township, near Chelsea.\n\nHe said he\u2019s very concerned about this for the environment in Washtenaw County, and plans to learn more about the proposal. He said he\u2019s likely to oppose it, because it\u2019s near one of the \u201cjewels\u201d of parkland in the county \u2013 the Pinckney State Recreation Area and Waterloo Recreation Area. There are also county parks in that area too, he said. \u201cI think it would be very damaging to the future of our community, Washtenaw County\u2019s recreation opportunities, and the environment as a whole to allow that project to move forward,\u201d Rabhi said. It would also impact the quality of life in Chelsea, with gravel-hauling trucks going through the city, he added.\n\nRabhi said about 200 people had shown up to a public hearing earlier in the month, and he hoped to be involved in the process as it moves forward.\n\nThe site is located on M-52 across from Green Lake. Another public meeting is scheduled for Thursday, March 13 at 7 p.m. at the Washington Street Education Center Auditorium, 500 Washington St., 100 Building in Chelsea.\n\nCommunications & Commentary: Road Commission\n\nYousef Rabhi (D-District 8) reported that he\u2019d received a letter from the Sharon Township supervisor, Peter Psarouthakis, indicating that the township\u2019s board of trustees had voted not to support efforts to dissolve the Washtenaw County road commission.\n\nBy way of background, at their Oct. 2, 2013 meeting, commissioners created a seven-member subcommittee to \u201cexplore partnerships and organizational interactions with the Washtenaw County Road Commission.\u201d Members appointed at that time included four county commissioners: Alicia Ping of Saline (R-District 3), Conan Smith of Ann Arbor (D-District 9), Dan Smith of Northfield Township (R-District 2) and Rolland Sizemore Jr. of Ypsilanti Township (D-District 5). Ping serves as chair. Other members include three township supervisors: John Stanowski of York Township, Ken Schwartz of Superior Township and Pat Kelly of Dexter Township. For more details about this work, see Chronicle coverage: \u201cGroup Explores Road Commission\u2019s Future.\u201d\n\nThe subcommittee\u2019s most recent meeting was on Saturday, March 1 at 9 a.m. in the county administration building, 220 N. Main St. in Ann Arbor. During the 2.5-hour session, the group voted to recommend that the duties and responsibilities of the road commission should not be transferred to the county board of commissioners. Ping told The Chronicle after the March 1 meeting that unless given further direction from the board, the subcommittee\u2019s work is done.\n\nCommunications & Commentary: Tax Increment Financing (TIF)\n\nAndy LaBarre (D-District 7) reported that a committee has been working on policy recommendations regarding tax increment financing (TIF) projects, and will be bringing forward its recommendations soon.\n\nYousef Rabhi (D-District 8) thanked LaBarre for \u201cthrowing yourself on a grenade there for us.\u201d\n\nThe county\u2019s need for a policy to guide decisions related to TIF proposals was discussed last year in the context of Pittsfield Township\u2019s State Street corridor improvement authority (CIA), which the county board agreed to participate in. From Chronicle coverage of the board\u2019s Nov. 20, 2013 meeting:\n\nRonnie Peterson (D-District 6) asked whether a policy would be developed to guide the review of TIF proposals when they come forward. The board had previously discussed that approach. He noted that the board\u2019s vote on the Pittsfield Township CIA still stands, and he\u2019s in support of that. But a lot of questions have been raised by other commissioners, he added, and any community could come forward with the same kind of TIF proposal. Board chair Yousef Rabhi (D-District 8) said he\u2019s spoken to staff members who are working on a policy. The staff from the county\u2019s equalization department, the office of community & economic development, and the brownfield authority board are collaborating to develop a TIF policy. He hoped that staff would have something for the board to review later this year or in early 2014. It\u2019s important to have a good rationale for approving these agreements, Rabhi said.\n\nCommunications & Commentary: Public Commentary \u2013 GEDs\n\nDuring the evening\u2019s first opportunity for public commentary, Allison Tucker of Manchester spoke about the GED (general education diploma), saying she wanted to share some insights about how the GED can improve society. She said she was a GED graduate, and it\u2019s helped her tremendously. She\u2019s able to attend college now and subsequently will have more job opportunities. The GED is essential to the economy, she said, because it allows people who have aged out of school to continue working when new educational requirements are imposed. Children of graduates are less likely to be taken into a foster program due to having parents who aren\u2019t able to provide for them.\n\nThe GED should be more affordable, Tucker said, because it\u2019s essential for people who are in a bad financial situation, if they want to improve their lives. It can provide a second chance for people with substance abuse issues or who are ex-prisoners to discontinue their cycle of self-harm and build a better future, she said. Tucker concluded that the GED is a great way to improve the economy, people\u2019s skills and general lives, because the most effective way to do all these things is through education. It\u2019s time for the stigma around the GED to stop, and for it to be presented as what it is, she said: A stepping stone in life.\n\nIn responding to Tucker\u2019s commentary, Conan Smith (D-District 9) thanked her for raising this issue. He reported that Washtenaw County is in the early stages of a regional effort that also involves Livingston and Jackson counties to look at how adult education is delivered. For a lot of people, the system is difficult to access, he said, because it\u2019s fragmented in terms of where services are delivered. He said he was in a meeting recently about this with Mary Jo Callan, the county\u2019s director of the office of community and economic development, and the issue of certification programs also was addressed. Such programs should step beyond what the GED has to offer. He told Tucker that if she\u2019s interested, the county could find a way for her to be involved in this project.\n\nYousef Rabhi (D-District 8) also thanked Tucker, and noted that he\u2019d met her at a recent YouthSpeak forum that was held in the county administration building earlier this year. Elected officials had come to hear students speak about their experiences and to give suggestions for improving the education system.\n\nDuring the second opportunity for public commentary, Bonnie Truhn, a Milan resident, said she was there to support Tucker, who is in the adult transitions program at Washtenaw Community College. Truhn is manager of that program. She noted that Tucker had spoken at the recent Washtenaw Alliance for Children & Youth (WACY) event, and had been encouraged to share her views with the county board, too. The program at WCC is not just for GED, Truhn said. It\u2019s a career guidance program, and she thought commissioners would agree that this is what they want for the county. People should fully understand the challenges that are faced by students as well as those who are trying to provide instruction in the program. It\u2019s important to provide opportunities for people who will earn their GED, as well as for those who won\u2019t earn it, Truhn said, but who also need jobs.\n\nAndy LaBarre (D-District 7) replied that Truhn\u2019s comments are well-received. He noted that Jason Morgan, WCC\u2019s director of government relations, was attending the meeting for another reason. [Morgan was appointed during the meeting to the county's community action board.] LaBarre said he was sure that Morgan would take back Truhn\u2019s remarks to the WCC administration.\n\nRonnie Peterson (D-District 6) said that sometimes people wonder how their tax dollars are spent. Someone like Tucker shows that the county is able to lend support to \u201cthose who sometimes have those trips and falls along the way,\u201d Peterson said, and to make sure they had a second chance.\n\nCommunications & Commentary: Misc. Public Commentary\n\nThomas Partridge complained about the huge amounts of snow that had piled up at intersections and parking lots. He advocated for a countywide public transit system, and more funding for education, services for homelessness, and affordable housing. Partridge also called for a countywide public art program. He urged commissioners to address these issues.\n\nDuring the evening\u2019s second opportunity for public commentary, Partridge called for a more people-friendly democratic society, and to fully fund affordable housing. He asked how a county as wealthy as Washtenaw County could stand by when there are so many people who can\u2019t afford a place to live. There needs to be a countywide affordable housing commission to address this problem, he said, as well as a countywide affordable public transportation commission, and a countywide justice commission to oversee the courts.\n\nPresent: Andy LaBarre, Kent Martinez-Kratz, Ronnie Peterson, Yousef Rabhi, Conan Smith, Dan Smith.\n\nAbsent: Felicia Brabec, Alicia Ping, Rolland Sizemore Jr.\n\nNext regular board meeting: Wednesday, March 5, 2014 at 6:30 p.m. at the county administration building, 220 N. Main St. in Ann Arbor. The ways & means committee meets first, followed immediately by the regular board meeting. [Check Chronicle event listings to confirm date.] (Though the agenda states that the regular board meeting begins at 6:45 p.m., it usually starts much later \u2013 times vary depending on what\u2019s on the agenda.) Public commentary is held at the beginning of each meeting, and no advance sign-up is required.\n\nThe Chronicle could not survive without regular voluntary subscriptions to support our coverage of public bodies like the Washtenaw County board of commissioners.
