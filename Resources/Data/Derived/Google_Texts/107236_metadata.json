So what\u2019s left to decide? (Not to be confused with \u201cwhy are Court decisions moving left? \u2013 a remarkably premature assessment given the cases remaining, not to mention coding issues regarding liberal/conservative.)\n\nThere are seven cases outstanding and none of them are duds. Cato has filed in five of them and the other two involve the hot topics of redistricting and the death penalty, so strap yourselves in for the next week. Here\u2019s my best guess at what will happen and when, sorted arbitrarily by rough order of (my) curiosity and with links to case background and Cato\u2019s brief:\n\nKing v. Burwell : This is the Obamacare case regarding the illegal IRS rule that provides tax credits (and attendant mandates/penalties) in states that didn\u2019t set up exchanges. There are clearly four votes for the government and three for the plaintiffs, with Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Kennedy as the swing votes \u2013 and based on oral argument, they\u2019re complete toss-ups. This case will come on Friday or Monday and the only outcome I feel confident predicting is that Roberts or Kennedy will write the opinion and it\u2019ll be 5-4.\n\nObergefell v. Hodges : This is the marriage case. The conventional wisdom is that it\u2019ll come on the last day of term and that it\u2019ll be a 5-4 ruling striking down the state laws that don\u2019t extend marriage license to same-sex couples. I agree with the conventional wisdom, though wonder whether the chief justice will at least vote that states have to recognize out-of-state same-sex marriages without necessarily issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples themselves. Also, if King comes down the same day and the government loses there, it\u2019ll be fun watching both the media and politicos scrambling to both praise and condemn the Court at the same time.\n\nTexas Dept. of Housing v. Inclusive Communities Project : You may have forgotten about this case because it was argued much earlier than the others, but it very likely will be the third-most-noted case from this term. At issue is the application of \u201cdisparate impact\u201d claims under the Fair Housing Act. That sounds like a snooze until you realize that what\u2019s at stake is suing mortgage brokers for racial discrimination simply because they deny loans (or offer higher interest rates) more to members of one racial group than another \u2013 regardless of credit scores or other completely race-neutral considerations. Justice Kennedy is likely writing this opinion because he\u2019s the only one who hasn\u2019t authored a January case, which is a good sign for the opponents of disparate-impact theory because it seemed at oral argument that Justice Scalia was actually the swing vote. One other possibility, based on Scalia\u2019s expressed concern, is that the Court will set this case for re-argument on the question of whether disparate-impact claims, regardless of statutory basis, are constitutional.\n\nMichigan v. EPA : This is a hard case to understand but it boils down another example of an executive agency\u2019s ignoring the law it purports to enforce. In technical terms, the issue is whether the EPA \u201c unreasonably refused to consider costs in determining whether it is appropriate to regulate hazardous air pollutants emitted by electric utilities.\u201d This decision will have a huge impact on electricity costs, stock prices, and energy development. It will also, in conjunction with King, speak volumes about the power of administrative agencies. The smart bet is that Justice Scalia is writing the opinion here, against the government, but these complicated administrative-law cases often end up with multiple concurring opinions \u2013 particularly regarding remedy \u2013 and no clear winner. We could see this opinion on Thursday, but it could also be the \u201cundercard\u201d to gay-marriage day.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Predicting the remaining cases, which are all significant \u2013 not just Obamacare and marriage \u2013 and will be decided in the next week.", "og": {"site_name": "Cato Institute", "description": "Predicting the remaining cases, which are all significant -- not just Obamacare and marriage -- and will be decided in the next week.", "title": "What's Left at the Supreme Court?", "url": "http://www.cato.org/blog/whats-left-supreme-court", "image": "http://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/default_images/blog_torch_large.gif", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.cato.org/blog/whats-left-supreme-court", "title": "What's Left at the Supreme Court?", "description": "Predicting the remaining cases, which are all significant -- not just Obamacare and marriage -- and will be decided in the next week.", "card": "summary", "creator": "@CatoInstitute"}, "robots": "noodp", "site": "Cato Institute", "node_creation_date": "2015/6/23", "fb": {"admins": 5311211, "app_id": 158687980817033}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-23T14:35:05-04:00"}, "publication_date": "2015/6/23", "viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf137\"", "article_summary": "After yesterday\u2019s colorful opinion day \u2013 involving raisins, motels, and Spiderman \u2013 the Supreme Court announced that it would be handing down more rulings on Thursday and Friday, with Monday also currently indicated as a decision day.\n(Not to be confused with \u201cwhy are Court decisions moving left?\nObergefell v.
