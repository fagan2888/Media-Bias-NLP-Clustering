He was 16 when he raped Queena Vuong in 2008 and beat her so badly she is still unable to speak or walk.\n\nMorris was convicted of multiple charges in both cases, with each charge carrying a separate sentence. Some of the most serious charges resulted in sentences of 65 years.\n\nThe 2nd District Court of Appeal on Friday ruled those sentences were too severe in light of recent court rulings that make it much more difficult to sentence a minor to life in prison for charges outside of murder.\n\nThe court ruling said the 65-year sentences were in essence life in prison for Morris and ordered he be resentenced on those charges.\n\nAlthough Morris won the appeal and will be resentenced on those charges, he might not see less prison time. Because of clarifications of the law since his case went to trial, he could actually be resentenced to life in prison.\n\nIn the day care case, Morris was convicted of burglary with assault while armed, attempted robbery, sexual battery and attempted battery. He was sentenced to 65 years in prison on the rape and burglary convictions with lesser sentences on the other counts, all to run concurrently.\n\nIn the library case, Morris was convicted of kidnapping with intent to commit a felony, two counts of sexual battery and aggravated battery. He was sentenced to 65 years on each of the sexual battery convictions and 15 years for aggravated battery, all to run concurrently with the day care case sentences.\n\nWhile Friday\u2019s ruling by the appellate court ordered Morris be resentenced on the charges for which he was given 65 years, the ruling affirmed the convictions and all of the other sentences.\n\nProsecutors in Tampa were reading over the ruling from the 2nd District Court of Appeal on Friday, said Mark Cox, spokesman for the Hillsborough County State Attorney\u2019s Office.\n\n\u201cIt is welcome news in that the convictions were affirmed,\u201d he said.\n\nProsecutors knew the sentences might be overturned on appeal, but in light of recent court rulings clarifying conditions under which juveniles can be sentenced to life, they will push for a life sentence, Cox said.\n\n\u201cWe certainly feel at this juncture that (Morris) deserves life,\u201d Cox said, \u201cand we will ask for that.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe appellate court quoted the judge at Morris\u2019 trial as saying \u201cthat if ever a set of facts called for sentencing a juvenile to life imprisonment, these were the cases.\u201d\n\nCox said prosecutors don\u2019t yet know whether the resentencing process could involve a full hearing, including family members of the victims testifying.\n\nThe April 2008 attack of Queena Vuong, then 18, outside the Bloomingdale library left her severely disabled. Morris also broke into a day care center in June 2007 and attacked a female employee arriving at work. The teenager wore a ski mask and held a knife, demanding money and then raping the woman.\n\nThe attacks and Morris\u2019 eventual arrest created widespread outrage in the community and heavy media coverage of the attacks and trials.\n\nVuong\u2019s family learned of the appeals court decision Friday afternoon. Their main concern is more on Queena\u2019s recovery than Morris\u2019 fate, said her sister, Anna.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just so focused on Queena getting better and with her therapy,\u201d Anna Vuong said. \u201cThis never has been on the forefront of our minds.\u201d\n\nDuring the two trials, defense attorneys argued for leniency, saying Morris\u2019 age and abuse he suffered as a child should be taken into consideration during sentencing.\n\nProsecutors argued the premeditated nature of some of the offenses and the severity of the crimes called for a lengthy prison sentence in spite of Morris\u2019 age and background.\n\nCharles Rose, a law professor at Stetson University, said it\u2019s possible Morris could receive a life prison sentence when he is brought back before the trial judge.\n\n\u201cI believe they probably have to determine whether or not under Florida law (Morris) classifies as an adult as it pertains to sentencing,\u2019\u2019 Rose said. \u201cThere probably wasn\u2019t enough on the record to make that clear.\u201d\n\nResentencing will be another emotional experience for Queena\u2019s family, said Anna Vuong.\n\n\u201cBut we\u2019ll stay strong and everything will turn out fine in the hands of prosecutors and the judicial system,\u201d she said. \u201c\u201cWe just don\u2019t want to get our hopes up. In the end, whatever is fair will happen. We trust in that and it makes us feel better.\u201d\n\nkmorelli@tampatrib.com\n\n(813) 259-7760", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sat, 22 Aug 2015 00:01:00 -0400", "Description": "An appeals court has thrown out the harshest parts of the sentences against a man convicted of sexually battering a day care worker and later raping and brutally beating a teenager outside the Bloomingdale Regional Library.", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "An appeals court has thrown out the harshest parts of the sentences against a man convicted of sexually battering a day care worker and later raping and brutally beating a teenager outside the Bloomingdale Regional Library.", "title": "65-year sentences rejected for teen Bloomingdale library rapist", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/news/breaking-news/65-year-sentences-for-teen-rejected-20150821/", "image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20150822/ARTICLE/150829747/AR/0/AR-150829747.jpg", "height": 1463}, "updated_time": "2015-08-22T14:28:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "tbo.com", "description": "An appeals court has thrown out the harshest parts of the sentences against a man convicted of sexually battering a day care worker and later raping and brutally beating a teenager outside the Bloomingdale Regional Library.", "title": "65-year sentences rejected for teen Bloomingdale library rapist", "image": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20150822/ARTICLE/150829747/AR/0/AR-150829747.jpg", "site": "@TBOcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2015-08-22T00:01:00Z-04", "modified_time": "2015-08-22T14:28:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7f0c\"", "article_summary": "In the day care case, Morris was convicted of burglary with assault while armed, attempted robbery, sexual battery and attempted battery.\nThe court ruling said the 65-year sentences were in essence life in prison for Morris and ordered he be resentenced on those charges.\nKendrick Morris, who turns 24 on Monday, was 15 when he sexually battered the day care worker in 2007.\nMorris also broke into a day care center in June 2007 and attacked a female employee arriving at work.\nCharles Rose, a law professor at Stetson University, said it\u2019s possible Morris could receive a life prison sentence when he is brought back before the trial judge."}
