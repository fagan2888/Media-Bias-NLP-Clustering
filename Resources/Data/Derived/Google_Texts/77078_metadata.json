This is a reminder that when it comes to certain crimes, some on the left reserve the right to a law-and-order response.\n\nAt Slate, Jamelle Bouie observered:\n\n\u201cWhy won\u2019t they shoot at armed white fanatics isn\u2019t just the wrong question; it\u2019s a bad one. Not only does it hold lethal violence as a fair response to the Bundy militia, but it opens a path to legitimizing the same violence against more marginalized groups\u2026If we\u2019re outraged, it shouldn\u2019t be because law enforcement isn\u2019t rushing to violently confront Bundy and his group. We should be outraged because that restraint isn\u2019t extended to all Americans.\u201d\n\nThe Black Lives Matter movement has drawn critical scrutiny to mass incarceration and abusive policing, and made the point that both impact black people in a grossly disproportionate manner. How disproportionate? ProPublica found that young black males were 21 times more likely to be shot dead by police than their white counterparts in recent years. In 2014, black men were 7.6 times more likely to be imprisoned than white men, according to the Marshall Project.\n\nSome have also, however, taken that argument a step further and asserted that police and the criminal justice system treat white criminals too kindly.\n\nLast June, there was the internet firestorm in response to the news that \u201cPolice bought Dylann Storm Roof Burger King after arrest.\u201d That same month, Mic displayed a photo of bikers checking their phones and hanging out after a shootout left nine dead in Waco, Texas as one of multiple \u201cStunning Images\u201d that \u201cReveal the Racist Double Standard of Police Responses in America.\u201d In reality, bikers present for that shootout have been subjected to one of the most indiscriminate mass prosecutions (177 people were arrested) in recent history.\n\nBefore that, in late 2014, the #crimingwhilewhite hashtag exploded.\n\nIn closed park after curfew, underage drinking liquor bought with fake IDs. Cop told us, \"Get on home,\" let us drive away #CrimingWhileWhite \u2014 Jenny Grace (@grace134) December 4, 2014\n\nThinkProgress dubbed #CrimingWhileWhite \u201cThe Only Thing You Need To Read To Understand White Privilege.\u201d\n\nWhite people\u2019s confessions of getting away with crimes were intended to highlight the criminal justice system\u2019s racism. Some, like Jessica Valenti, criticized the e-movement for highlighting white people\u2019s experiences at a time when black suffering needed to be in sharp focus. What was most unfortunate about #CrimingWhileWhite, however, is that it came off like a bunch of affluent white people talking about experiences that poor white people might find entirely unrecognizable.\n\nControlling for class, there is still a major racial disparity in incarceration rates\u2014but far less of one, according to a 2010 study published in Daedalus. The authors looked at men born between 1975 and 1979 and found that, over all, the black men were five times more likely than white counterparts to serve time in prison (27 versus 5 percent) by their early thirties. By contrast, black high school dropouts were two-and-a-half times more likely to enter prison than white dropouts (68 versus 28 percent).\n\nPoor blacks are hit much the hardest: the hyperincarceration that governs life in extremely poor and highly segregated black neighborhoods is a unique phenomenon. But poor whites have it bad as well. The black members of the studied cohort with a high school education were less likely to enter prison than a white high school dropout, and far less likely if they had a college degree.\n\nAffluent black people share aspects of racial discrimination and disadvantage with poor black people, and poor whites share some white privilege with rich whites. But poor blacks on the South Side of Chicago and poor whites in Appalachia also share an experience of economic marginalization, incarceration included, that is utterly foreign to most well-to-do people of any color.\n\n* * *\n\nResearch suggests that when white people are confronted with evidence of the criminal justice systems\u2019s racist impact they are actually more likely to support punitive policies. This is because of racism, and because emphasizing racial disparity risks reinforcing racist stereotypes about black criminality. It\u2019s also because the American left lacks much in the way of a multiracial working class movement.\n\nAnyone who has spent time covering the criminal justice system, or spent time inside of it, is aware of countless stories of white (not to mention Latino) people unjustly jammed up. The majority of the victims of police brutality and unjust imprisonment that I\u2019ve interviewed and written about, in Philadelphia and elsewhere, are black. But not all. The abusive cops and prison guards I\u2019ve encountered, contrary to the media\u2019s insistent references to certain abusive officers being white, were both black and white. The system is fundamentally racist. But it is also a machine that destroys poor and working class people of all colors.", "article_metadata": {"description": "When the Bundy siege began in Oregon this month, many were calling for their heads.
