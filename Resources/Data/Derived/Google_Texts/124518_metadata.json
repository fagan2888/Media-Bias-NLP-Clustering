It was dubbed the \u201cCadillac tax\u201d because many believed it would apply only to gold-plated coverage provided to high-paid workers.\n\nHowever, 48 percent of companies are likely to be subject to the tax in 2018 and 82 percent could be liable by 2023, according to benefits consultant Towers Watson.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been calling it the \u2018Chevy tax,\u2019\u201d said Anna Fendley, a legislative representative with the United Steelworkers union. \u201cThis is a tax that\u2019s really falling on the backs of working people.\u201d\n\nThe USW represents workers at Pittsburgh specialty metals producer Allegheny Technologies, where the labor agreement expired June 30. The union also represents workers at Pittsburgh-based U.S. Steel and at Arcelor Mittal, the world\u2019s largest steel producer. Contracts covering USW workers at those companies\u2019 U.S. sheet mills, iron ore mines and coke plants will expire Sept. 1.\n\nThe contracts being negotiated are expected to run through 2018, when the tax takes effect. Starting then, employers will have to pay 40 cents for every dollar that health care premiums exceed $10,200 for individual coverage and $27,500 for family coverage.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think any of the companies will sign on for anything that is a Cadillac plan,\u201d said metals industry analyst John Tumazos of Holmdel, N.J.\n\nCompany and employee contributions to the premium count toward the limit. The ceiling will increase annually, but only based on overall inflation. Since health care costs are increasing faster than the overall cost of living, many experts say more companies will be subject to the tax each year.\n\n\u201cThe tax is going to hit everyone eventually,\u201d said Karen Marlo, vice president of the National Business Group on Health, which represents more than 400 large U.S. employers.\n\nShe said that if employers have to pay the tax, it\u2019s \u201ca very real possibility\u201d that employees will have to foot part of the bill.\n\nAllegheny Technologies\u2019 final contract proposal was a four-year deal that included a provision requiring new negotiations during the life of the agreement if the company projected escalating premiums would trigger the tax. At that point, the contract would be amended to prevent that from happening, according to a copy of the proposal on the USW website.\n\nThe specialty metals producer is taking measures that many other employers have used to avoid the tax, including switching to health plans that require workers to pay higher deductibles. USW-represented workers would see maximum out-of-pocket costs for those with family coverage jump from $3,000 in the first year of the contract to $6,000 in the final year, under the company\u2019s proposal.\n\nPart of the problem that employers have in coming up with a strategy for avoiding the tax is that the federal government is still developing rules for how to implement it.\n\nIn addition, there are efforts in Congress to repeal the tax. Legislation introduced by U.S. Rep. Joe Courtney, D-Conn., has more than 100 co-sponsors. His measure is backed by the USW and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s rare that we\u2019re on the same page as the Chamber of Commerce on something,\u201d Ms. Fendley said. \u201cWe\u2019re very optimistic that Congress will do something about this tax.\u201d\n\nLen Boselovic: lboselovic@post-gazette.com or 412-263-1941.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Thousands of union steelworkers facing changes in health care benefits because of a tax imposed by the president\u2019s Affordable Care Act.", "og": {"site_name": "Pittsburgh Post-Gazette", "description": "A provision of the Affordable Care Act, which is one reason Allegheny Technologies locked out more than 2,000 union workers last week at 12 plants in six states, also could be a stumbling block in negotiations involving two other major steel producers whose contracts covering about 30,000 union workers expire in less than two weeks.
