All I can think is \u2018Screw it! I\u2019ll start fresh tomorrow.\u2019 I don\u2019t know how not to let my eating spiral into overeating.\u201d\n\nLydia, a 45 year-old minister from Akron, jumped in: \u201cInstead of believing that self-critical voice, I\u2019ve been telling myself: \u2018That\u2019s not what I believe.'\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you hear that?\u201d I asked Heidi. \u201cNext time you start thinking \u2018Screw it,\u2019 you might try \u2018That\u2019s not what I believe\u2019 or another of Lydia\u2019s inspired responses.\u201d\n\nHeidi and Lydia (not their real names) are talking face to face, but not in person. Thanks to recent telecommunications advances, the 650 miles between the two are no barrier to participating in my eight-week group on using self-compassion for eating issues. Nor is a six-hour time difference. Last week, one participant Skyped in from her Lisbon hotel room.\n\nYes, I\u2019ve jumped on the telemedicine bandwagon. I\u2019m just discovering what hospitals, home health agencies and other major health organizations have been touting as the most cost-effective alternative to traditional face-to-face medicine since castor oil.\n\nClients with food and body image issues generally feel a lot less self-conscious attending a group remotely than up close and personal.\n\nI knew about the telemedicine or \u201ctelehealth\u201d trend, using technology to remotely deliver health-care services and information. But I\u2019d never seriously considered joining the high-tech trendsetters. For decades, I\u2019ve been happily providing individual and group therapy the old-fashioned way, and there are major legal questions about virtual psychotherapy, particularly across state lines.\n\nAccording to Marlene M. Maheu, Ph.D., Executive Director of the Telemental Health Institute, \u201cIt\u2019s the wild west. Clinicians are making up their own rules and disregarding those they agreed to follow when they got their licenses, and the consumers are at risk. They really don\u2019t know who\u2019s the right person to go to.\u201d\n\nThen, three things converged:\n\n\u2022 Sixty-five members of The Center for Mindful Eating from around the world enthusiastically participated in my teleconference on The Self-Compassion Diet.\n\n\u2022 My clients started complaining about sitting in traffic during the interminable reconstruction of Route 2 in Concord, Mass.\n\n\u2022 One client couldn\u2019t say enough about her Skype sessions with Los Angeles nutritionist and mindful eating author, Evelyn Tribole.\n\nSo I asked myself: \u201cWhy not Skype with clients?\u201d Well, because telemedicine has real downsides. Besides the fuzzy legal regulations, I had at least three other concerns:\n\n\u2022 Cost: Skype is free, and most of my clients already have what it takes \u2014 Internet access and a computer with a webcam \u2014 to telecommunicate, but a good number have insurance plans that don\u2019t reimburse on-line therapy. Containing the rising cost of health care may be telemedicine\u2019s big selling point (it\u2019s been touted as a better way to manage chronic diseases and shorten or eliminate hospital stays) but for my clients who rely on insurance reimbursements, an office visit is still their best, most affordable bet.\n\n\u2022 Privacy: Skype therapy puts client protected health information at greater risk. There may be a growing number of HIPAA-compliant telecommunication services available, but there\u2019s still no surefire way to ensure client confidentiality on-line.\n\n\u2022 Technical difficulties: Static, screen freezes and call disconnects aren\u2019t so bad when Skyping with friends and family, but the possibility of being disconnected from a suicidal client, that\u2019s a serious problem. The very idea of handling a life-or-death crisis 3,000 miles away is one more reason I\u2019m not providing Skype therapy.\n\nThat said, the upsides of this new medium are substantial. I\u2019m most impressed by the following three:\n\n\u2022 Greater access: Telemedicine gives healthcare consumers greater choice about who they consult where, when and how often. Better access, too. Whether you live in a remote village or a medical epicenter like Boston, there\u2019s no need to travel any distance or whittle away the hours in the waiting room. At least, not when the doctor or your chosen health care professional is virtually in.\n\n\u2022 Improved quality: A growing number of studies have shown the quality of on-line care is just as good as in-person. In fact, researchers have found that mental health and ICU patients generally have better outcomes and greater patient satisfaction on-line.\n\n\u2022 Decreased self-consciousness: Clients with food and body image issues generally feel a lot less self-conscious attending a group remotely than up close and personal. One of my obese clients, who had no time for traditional group therapy, jumped at the chance to join my virtual group.\n\nI could go on and on about the benefits of running Skype groups for eating issues, but suffice it to say, I\u2019m in. So are my clients, especially Heidi, who\u2019s reaping the benefits of going easier on herself.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m allowing myself to eat without self-criticism,\u201d she reported at the next session. \u201cWhat a difference! I have more energy, I feel lighter. The whole week wasn\u2019t rosy. I binged once, but it didn\u2019t turn into days and days of binging. That\u2019s a first for me.\u201d\n\nAs for me, I\u2019d say this on-line group has done better than any group I\u2019ve run. Would they have done as well if we\u2019d met in person? I don\u2019t know. Which is why I\u2019m starting an in-person and an on-line group simultaneously. Will the on-line group have better outcomes and greater patient satisfaction? I aim to find out.\n\nJean Fain, LICSW, MSW, is a Harvard Medical School-affiliated psychotherapist and the author of \u201cThe Self-Compassion Diet.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A psychotherapist finds that running a group on eating issues long-distance via Skype works wonderfully, possibly even better than in person.", "og": {"site_name": "commonhealth", "description": "A psychotherapist finds that running a group on eating issues long-distance via Skype works wonderfully, possibly even better than in person.", "title": "Tele-Coach: How An Eating Therapist Learned To Love Skype", "url": "http://commonhealth.wbur.org/2014/05/skype-eating-issues-group", "image": "http://s3.amazonaws.com/media.wbur.org/wordpress/15/files/2014/05/jeanskype.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://commonhealth.wbur.org/2014/05/skype-eating-issues-group", "image": "//s3.amazonaws.com/media.wbur.org/wordpress/15/files/2014/05/jeanskype.jpg", "site": "@commonhealth", "card": "summary", "title": "Tele-Coach: How An Eating Therapist Learned To Love Skype"}, "DC.date.issued": "2014-05-16", "date": "Fri, 16 May 2014 11:15:46 -0400", "fb": {"admins": 1549080028, "app_id": 134067973330252}, "msvalidate.01": "D02D46BAEDB3F81FC1B1DE2A8CB69551"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb4aa\"", "article_summary": "Tele-Coach: How An Eating Therapist Learned To Love SkypeBy Jean FainGuest contributor\u201cHow\u2019d you do with your eating since last we met?\u201d I recently asked members of my group on food issues.\nThe very idea of handling a life-or-death crisis 3,000 miles away is one more reason I\u2019m not providing Skype therapy.\nThat\u2019s a first for me.\u201dAs for me, I\u2019d say this on-line group has done better than any group I\u2019ve run.\nFor decades, I\u2019ve been happily providing individual and group therapy the old-fashioned way, and there are major legal questions about virtual psychotherapy, particularly across state lines.\nOne of my obese clients, who had no time for traditional group therapy, jumped at the chance to join my virtual group."}
