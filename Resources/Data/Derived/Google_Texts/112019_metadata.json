For a dialogue-heavy film with maybe 10 seconds of actual physical aggression, August: Osage County is a remarkably violent experience. That\u2019s not a unique feature of the movie version, of course. As New York Times reviewer Charles Isherwood wrote in his 2007 review of the Broadway play, Violet \u201cflays\u201d the psyches of her family members; her \u201cwill to endure is inextricably tied up with the desire to fight and the need to wound,\u201d and she \u201ccan keep the blood in her own veins flowing only by drawing blood from others.\u201d But while Letts\u2019s play is billed as a \u201cdark comedy,\u201d the film adaptation of his Pulitzer- and Tony-winning work goes skimpy on the comedy end of that phrase. In the hands of veteran TV director John Wells, Letts\u2019s story of a sprawling, unhappy family all gathered thrown into one crowded house to mourn their patriarch retains a few moments of cathartic humor, but could be more adequately called a lengthy, relentless assault of shrill tantrums and deep, shocking despair.\n\nViolet\u2019s three adult daughters return to their hometown of Pawhuska, Oklahoma, when their father, Beverly\u2014a retired poet and an alcoholic, played by Sam Shepard\u2014goes missing and is found dead a few days later in a river, having committed suicide. Along for the ill-fated adventure are Violet\u2019s overbearing sister Mattie Fay (Margo Martindale), her husband Charlie (Chris Cooper), and their perpetually unemployed adult son Little Charles (Benedict Cumberbatch), whom Mattie Fay considers the family idiot (and the rest of the clan follows her lead). All three daughters show up to comfort their newly widowed mother with lies of omission at the ready: Sharp-tongued Barbara (Julia Roberts) has driven in from Colorado with her family, but she\u2019s recently separated from her husband Bill (Ewan McGregor), who\u2019s had an affair with a younger woman, and in her sullenness, she\u2019s rapidly driving both Bill and her moody teenage daughter Jean (Abigail Breslin) toward abandoning her. Dim, erratic Karen (Juliette Lewis) flies in from Miami with her slimy new fianc\u00e9 Steve (Dermot Mulroney), who\u2019s even slimier than he appears\u2014much slimier. And quiet Ivy (Masters of Sex\u2019s Julianne Nicholson) has a boyfriend, maybe for the first time in her life. But her unnamed lover, it turns out, is Little Charles\u2014her cousin. All these nasty truths\u2014and more\u2014bubble up and spew over in all sorts of excruciating ways. Old family secrets burst forth and new family scandals arise; there\u2019s adultery, there\u2019s incest, there\u2019s drug abuse, there\u2019s molestation. And in varying phases of her ever-present drug-induced haze, Violet finds ways to bluntly insult, abuse, accuse, or humiliate each relative individually until they\u2019ve all abandoned her, one by one, in anger or in wounded disillusionment. The performances are masterful: Mulroney is perfectly skin-crawling as Steve, Cumberbatch is heartbreaking as the kicked puppy Little Charles, and Nicholson\u2019s fiercely introverted Ivy may be the film\u2019s most intriguing character. The dependably excellent Cooper and Martindale do indeed deliver some excellent moments, particularly in their scenes of day-to-day husband-and-wife bickering. Misty Upham is a superbly subtle audience stand-in as Johnna, the unobtrusive live-in maid who watches wordlessly as the family implodes. And throughout, Juliette Lewis deftly demonstrates just how truly disgusting hopeful platitudes can seem to a grieving person.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The film adaptation of Tracy Letts&#39;s award-winning dysfunctional-family play largely skips the \"comedy\" part of \"dark comedy.\"", "author": "Ashley Fetters", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "The film adaptation of Tracy Letts&#39;s award-winning dysfunctional-family play largely skips the \"comedy\" part of \"dark comedy.\"", "title": "The Exhausting Emotional Violence of August: Osage County", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2013/12/august/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2013/12/the-exhausting-emotional-violence-of-em-august-osage-county-em/282648/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2be3\"", "article_summary": "Old family secrets burst forth and new family scandals arise; there\u2019s adultery, there\u2019s incest, there\u2019s drug abuse, there\u2019s molestation.\nFor a dialogue-heavy film with maybe 10 seconds of actual physical aggression, August: Osage County is a remarkably violent experience.\nThe performances are masterful: Mulroney is perfectly skin-crawling as Steve, Cumberbatch is heartbreaking as the kicked puppy Little Charles, and Nicholson\u2019s fiercely introverted Ivy may be the film\u2019s most intriguing character.\nMisty Upham is a superbly subtle audience stand-in as Johnna, the unobtrusive live-in maid who watches wordlessly as the family implodes.\nAnd throughout, Juliette Lewis deftly demonstrates just how truly disgusting hopeful platitudes can seem to a grieving person."}
