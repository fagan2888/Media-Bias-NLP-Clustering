Her main requirement while plan-shopping? That the three doctors she sees for routine care were in the provider network. She thought she\u2019d found just the coverage through Nevada Health CO-OP, a new, nonprofit insurer that listed her existing doctors in its network.\n\nBut when Kaplan asked the CO-OP last week for a new list so she could find an internist, the updated version they sent her didn\u2019t have any of her doctors on it. Kaplan called to ask why, and said she was told that doctors can opt out of a network at any time.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m paying $388 (in monthly premiums) for a plan that none of my doctors are in. Now I need to know what to do,\u201d she said.\n\nThe CO-OP released a wide-ranging statement late Monday that blamed the state exchange\u2019s website, Nevada Health Link, for its woes, though the insurer\u2019s comments focused on not getting \u201cfull membership information\u201d from the exchange, rather than explaining why it\u2019s having network problems. The statement did say that provider networks \u201csometimes change as both insurers and doctors make changes to their practice.\u201d It added that it updates its local, 2,000-provider directory weekly to stay current on network changes, and said members should check its website rather than www.nevadahealthlink.com for network details.\n\nBut the CO-OP\u2019s problems seem to affect only it. Neither Anthem nor UnitedHealthcare, the other two carriers selling in Southern Nevada through the state exchange, are having network problems, said Frank Nolimal, an employee benefits adviser with Las Vegas insurance brokerage Assurance Ltd.\n\nAnd CJ Bawden, a spokesman for the Silver State Health Insurance Exchange, said early Monday that insurers such as the CO-OP contract with doctor networks separately from the exchange, which is just a marketplace through which carriers sell coverage. The exchange posts provider directories online as they get them from insurers, he said.\n\nRegardless of how or why they\u2019re happening, the network issues are causing big headaches for consumers. Kaplan said she decided to share her plight because she doesn\u2019t want others to be surprised when they go to the doctor\u2019s office. At 53, she\u2019s a long-time buyer of individual insurance and a savvy, experienced health-care user. Consumers who are experiencing their first go-round with buying and using a plan need a heads-up, she said.\n\n\u201cPeople who finally got through all of the exchange\u2019s website issues think they\u2019re covered by the doctors they go to,\u201d she said. \u201cThey (the CO-OP) have to come out and say to people, \u2018The physicians you signed up for may not accept this insurance.\u2019 Otherwise, it\u2019s just false advertising.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t supposed to be this way for the CO-OP, part of a relatively simple concept added to the Affordable Care Act to create consumer-driven, locally based health plans for state insurance exchanges. The Nevada Health CO-OP has three sponsors: the Culinary Local 226\u2019s Health Fund; its national parent, UNITE HERE Health; and the Health Services Coalition, a local consumer-advocacy group that negotiates health care costs and tracks quality of care for more than 300,000 members employed through cities, unions and major companies.\n\nThe sponsors won the federal contract \u2014 and $65.9 million in federal startup loans \u2014 in May 2012. CO-OP officials planned to double up on the Culinary\u2019s existing, extensive provider networks.\n\nIt\u2019s not always working that way in practice, though CO-OP officials said in their statement that the nonprofit has already covered office visits, prescriptions, procedures and hospitalizations, and even authorized an organ transplant, since its plans went live Jan. 1. Still, Kaplan isn\u2019t the only CO-OP member reporting issues with networks.\n\nNolimal said a client called last week to tell him that a local cancer center turned her away because the center was no longer in the CO-OP\u2019s network as of Jan. 1. Nolimal said the cancer center confirmed this when he called to follow up.\n\nAlso last week, an administrator for a local allergy and asthma doctor called Nolimal to say neither he nor any other allergy specialists in town have signed contracts with the CO-OP. The doctor\u2019s staffer told Nolimal the office has nonetheless cared for a dozen CO-OP members \u201cjust for the good of the order, to take care of people.\u201d\n\nNolimal said doctors on the Culinary\u2019s networks tell him the CO-OP gave them a verbal network commitment in early December, but as of last week those doctors had not been sent a written contract. They don\u2019t want to \u201cget combative\u201d with the CO-OP, because many providers have big patient numbers through the Culinary\u2019s contracts, he said.\n\nThe CO-OP\u2019s Facebook page carries a number of consumer complaints, including one from a woman who said the only plan-based gynecologist near her has three malpractice allegations on his record. Another post was from a woman who described being \u201cescorted\u201d out of her primary-care doctor\u2019s office for having \u201cunbillable\u201d coverage.\n\nNolimal said the problem with the CO-OP mystifies him.\n\n\u201cIt seemingly would have been the easiest part of the transition,\u201d he said. \u201cYou would just amend the existing (Culinary) contracts with providers to say they\u2019re also working under the Nevada Health CO-OP.\u201d\n\nBut asking the CO-OP what the issue is, or when it will be fixed, isn\u2019t getting Kaplan or Nolimal answers.\n\n\u201cThey basically didn\u2019t know what to tell me,\u201d Kaplan said.\n\nHer broker told her she would have to cancel her plan, create a new account through the exchange\u2019s website, choose a new plan, stop paying for her current plan, and deactivate her CO-OP plan when her next policy is in place.\n\nThe CO-OP did call Kaplan back Friday, after she wrote on the insurer\u2019s Facebook page, to tell her she may be able to switch to a different CO-OP plan with her doctors in the network. But Kaplan wasn\u2019t sure by press time what the plan would be, or whether it would cost more; it did appear that her new coverage might come with higher copays.\n\nFor Nolimal, queries to the CO-OP about its problems have gotten him this: \u201cThe verbal response is, \u2018We are working on it.\u2019\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not enough for brokers because of concerns about potential liability, he said.\n\n\u201cI have been misrepresenting this to my clients for the last 105 days, saying that the CO-OP is being represented by the Culinary\u2019s network,\u201d Nolimal said. \u201cIt scares me. My signature is on documents that place business in force with them. For me and my agents trying to sell through the CO-OP, what are you doing to me as far as liability?\u201d\n\nThe issues are also a blow for consumers who were promised coverage under the new law.\n\n\u201cI was way for Obamacare because finally, insurers can\u2019t ignore a pre-existing condition,\u201d said Kaplan, who will eventually need a knee surgery that her pre-Obamacare policy wouldn\u2019t cover.\n\nNow, Kaplan says she\u2019s beyond frustrated.\n\n\u201cI understand that something new always has glitches. But when I pay money for something, I want someone to stand behind what I purchased,\u201d she said. \u201cIf the people I\u2019m talking to don\u2019t have answers to my questions, there are plenty of people out of work these days. Fill those positions with people who know the answers.\u201d\n\nContact reporter Jennifer Robison at jrobison@reviewjournal.com.
