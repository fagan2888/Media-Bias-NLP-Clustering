(Although it\u2019s true. Really!) Now that it\u2019s officially summertime, things get a lot simpler: The world is undergoing global warming. Ergo, it\u2019s going to get warmer.\n\nA lot warmer, even \u2014 to the point that Americans could start seeing from 45 to 96 days over 95 degrees Fahrenheit, two to three times as many as we experience now, by the end of the century. Climate change, the IPCC predicts, \u201cis likely to be accompanied by an increase in the frequency and intensity of heat waves\u201d (prolonged periods of abnormally hot weather) that, coupled with a concurrent rise in humidity, will pose a major health risk.\n\nBut we don\u2019t only have to trust scientific modeling to know that summers are getting hotter: A trend of increasing high-humidity heat waves has already been documented over the past several decades. According to the National Climate Assessment, heat waves in the U.S. are already occurring at triple the historical average. Look back at the data, and it\u2019s clear that summer temperatures have been rising since the 1970s, for a total average gain of 2 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nCan\u2019t stand the heat? Well, too bad, because sweating it out in hotter temperatures is only the beginning of what a warmer planet will mean. Below, six other ways that climate change will \u2014 and has already begun to \u2014 ruin summertime:\n\n1. Drought\n\nAs climate change worsens, wet areas will see more precipitation, while dry areas are just going to get drier.\n\nThat trend is already playing out for large swaths of the country, most notably California. Two days before the start of summer, the entire state was officially in a drought, while a full third had entered the most extreme stage of \u201cexceptional drought.\u201d People are trying to get used to the idea of shorter showers and brown lawns, the price of fresh fruits and vegetables is expected to increase 6 percent over the coming months and breweries are fretting about what water rationing is going to mean for their beer (quoth Lagunitas head brewer Jeremy Marshall: \u201ca beer that might normally taste crisp and refreshing could have an astringent taste \u2014 kind of planky, like Popsicle stick\u201d). The forecast through September, according to the Climate Prediction Center, doesn\u2019t promise much relief:\n\n2. Wildfires\n\nA number of factors, including development and a decades-long policy of fire suppression, combine to intensify wildfire season, but warmer and drier conditions can increase the frequency and intensity of dangerous blazes. As spring snowmelt occurs earlier and summer pushes into the fall, the burn season extends; as a 2012 Climate Central report showed, both temperatures and the number of large fires are increasing in Western states:\n\nThis year, California\u2019s anticipating its \u201cworst-ever\u201d season; in the future, predicts Gov. Jerry Brown, it\u2019s going to need thousands more firefighters on the job. New Mexico, too, is emerging from a record dry winter to a \u201cgrim and potentially extreme situation\u201d over the summer months, as is Arizona. But after two particularly brutal years, the rest of the country is anticipated to get off easy \u2014 this time around.\n\n3. Air pollution\n\nThe dominoes continue to fall: As warming leads to drought leads to wildfires, those big burns in turn release a \u201cmix of gases and fine particles\u201d that can at best be irritating and at worst make you sick. You can live hundreds of miles away from a wildfire\u2019s burn zone and still be at risk; in 2011, the area affected by smoke, a report from the Natural Resources Defense Council found, was 50 times greater than the area burned by fire:\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "Heat waves are only the beginning -- it's about to get really ugly out there, everyone VIDEO", "title": "6 ways climate change is ruining summer for everyone", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Heat waves are only the beginning -- it's about to get really ugly out there, everyone VIDEO", "title": "6 ways climate change is ruining summer for everyone", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/07/13/6_ways_climate_change_is_ruining_summer_for_everyone/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/shutterstock_154979021.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Heat waves are only the beginning -- it's about to get really ugly out there, everyone VIDEO", "title": "6 ways climate change is ruining summer for everyone", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/shutterstock_154979021.jpg", "creator": "@readingirl", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Lindsay Abrams", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, California Drought, Climate Change, drought, Editor's Picks, Extreme weather, Global Warming, public health, Seafood, Summer, Video, Wildfires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Below, six other ways that climate change will \u2014 and has already begun to \u2014 ruin summertime:1.\nDroughtAs climate change worsens, wet areas will see more precipitation, while dry areas are just going to get drier.\nAccording to the National Climate Assessment, heat waves in the U.S. are already occurring at triple the historical average.\nClimate change, the IPCC predicts, \u201cis likely to be accompanied by an increase in the frequency and intensity of heat waves\u201d (prolonged periods of abnormally hot weather) that, coupled with a concurrent rise in humidity, will pose a major health risk.\nBut we don\u2019t only have to trust scientific modeling to know that summers are getting hotter: A trend of increasing high-humidity heat waves has already been documented over the past several decades."}
