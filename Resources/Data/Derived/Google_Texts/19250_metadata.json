He speaks from the vantage point of a first-team all-pro selection and an appearance in the Pro Bowl last season.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a machine,\u201d Vasquez said of Garland, who played as a defensive lineman at the Air Force Academy, and just made the Broncos\u2019 regular-season roster for the first time in three tries. \u201cWe all make fun of him because no matter what, he\u2019s always working, as if he\u2019s a machine.\u201d\n\nGarland knows no other way to play the game. But there\u2019s more to Garland\u2019s climb. He\u2019s had to learn a different part of the game, moving to the offensive line.\n\n\u201cThe difference between playing on the defensive line and the offensive line is like night and day,\u201d Garland said. \u201cDefense is a lot about reacting. To play on the offensive line, there\u2019s a need to understand how the other team\u2019s defense works and how the offense works together.\u201d\n\nGarland spent last season on the practice squad, making the transition to offensive guard.\n\n\u201cIn general there isn\u2019t anything you do on the offensive line that seems natural,\u201d Garland said. \u201cYou have to maintain perfect balance, but at the same time be extremely aggressive and powerful, and hit as hard as you can while under complete control. The body control and footwork are extremely different.\u201d\n\nGarland credits tips from his teammates and coaches with helping him make the transition.\n\n\u201cAnything that Ben does, doesn\u2019t surprise you,\u201d Broncos coach John Fox said. \u201cHe was trained by the best in the business in our military. He\u2019s very smart and very tough. Ben got what he deserved (making the roster) and he worked very hard to get there.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not good enough for Garland.\n\n\u201cMy goal always is to be the best in the league at whatever I do,\u201d he said. \u201cMaking an NFL roster is extremely tough. It could have gone the other way. I\u2019m so happy the Broncos gave me the opportunity to try another position.\u201d\n\nGarland would have gone back into the military if he hadn\u2019t made the Broncos roster. He had served in active duty in 2010-11 after graduation from Air Force.\n\n\u201cI always wanted to be an Air Force officer,\u201d Garland said. \u201cBut I always dreamed of playing in the NFL. It was like weighing one dream against the other. I\u2019m happy with my decision.\u201d\n\nSunday he\u2019ll be at Sports Authority Field at Mile High for his first game as an NFL player.\n\nAn ankle injury has kept Garland off the practice field this week and will cause him to miss Sunday\u2019s game and possibly next week\u2019s game. But the Machine wants to get moving.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m ready,\u201d Garland said after Thursday\u2019s practice. \u201cI\u2019m ready to go.\u201d\n\nIrv Moss: 303-954-1296, imoss@denverpost.com or twitter.com/irvmoss", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "For Broncos\u2019 Ben Garland, a roster spot isn\u2019t good enough", "title": "For Broncos\u2019 Ben Garland, a roster spot isn\u2019t good enough", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/09/05/for-broncos-ben-garland-a-roster-spot-isnt-good-enough/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140905__garlandp1.jpg", "height": 444}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140905__garlandp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-05T10:58:31+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T05:10:31+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca791\"", "article_summary": "When Louis Vasquez is asked to access his teammates on the Broncos\u2019 offensive line, he has a special description for Ben Garland.\nI\u2019m so happy the Broncos gave me the opportunity to try another position.\u201dGarland would have gone back into the military if he hadn\u2019t made the Broncos roster.\n\u201cThe difference between playing on the defensive line and the offensive line is like night and day,\u201d Garland said.\n\u201cIn general there isn\u2019t anything you do on the offensive line that seems natural,\u201d Garland said.\nBen got what he deserved (making the roster) and he worked very hard to get there.\u201dThat\u2019s not good enough for Garland."}
