I just wanted an older, cooler playmate; I never considered the potential downside.\n\nNow, at 22, I\u2019ve heard my share of horror stories; the sibling bullies who called my friends \u201cbutt face\u201d or \u201cstupid\u201d or \u201cbrat;\u201d the burnt Barbie dolls; the bag of caterpillars dumped on my poor friend\u2019s head.\n\nIs sibling bullying just a harmless rite of passage \u2014 or can it actually entail developmental repercussions?\n\nA new study published today by the American Academy of Pediatrics targets that very question. After surveying more than 6,900 young people in the UK, researchers found that victims of frequent sibling bullying were twice as predisposed to depression, anxiety, and self-harm in young adulthood as non-bullied controls. This British-based study comes on the heels of similar findings in an American study last year. From the paper:\n\nOf the 786 children who reported that they had been bullied by a sibling several times a week (55.3% female), depression was reported by 12.3% at age 18 years, self-harm occurred in 14.1%, and anxiety was reported by 16.0%.\n\nAnd from the abstract:\n\nThe population-attributable fractions suggested that 13.0% of depression and 19.3% of self-harm could be explained by being the victim of sibling bullying if these were causal relationships.\n\nThe earlier American study, also published in \u201cPediatrics,\u201d concluded that, \u201c\u2026Parents, pediatricians and the public should treat sibling aggression as potentially harmful, and not dismiss it as normal, minor, or even beneficial, and this message should be included in parenting education.\u201d\n\nThe authors of this new study say: \u201cOur results suggest that interventions designed to target sibling bullying should be devised and evaluated.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s looking more and more like getting pranked and teased by an older sibling isn\u2019t quite as innocuous as it may seem.\n\nFurther reading:\n\nStudy: Bullying Toll May Linger For Years, Leading To \u2018Substantially\u2019 Worse Health\n\nBullying At Home Aggressive Siblings Hurt Mental Health, Study Finds", "article_metadata": {"description": "A new study finds that young people who were frequently bullied by their siblings are at double the risk of depression, anxiety and self-harm.", "og": {"site_name": "commonhealth", "description": "A new study finds that young people who were frequently bullied by their siblings are at double the risk of depression, anxiety and self-harm.", "title": "Study: Bullying By Siblings May Double Risk Of Depression, Self-Harm", "url": "http://commonhealth.wbur.org/2014/09/study-bullying-by-siblings-may-double-risk-of-depression-self-harm", "image": "http://s3.amazonaws.com/media.wbur.org/wordpress/15/files/2013/06/bullyfreezone-620x826.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://commonhealth.wbur.org/2014/09/study-bullying-by-siblings-may-double-risk-of-depression-self-harm", "image": "//s3.amazonaws.com/media.wbur.org/wordpress/15/files/2013/06/bullyfreezone-620x826.jpg", "site": "@commonhealth", "card": "summary", "title": "Study: Bullying By Siblings May Double Risk Of Depression, Self-Harm"}, "DC.date.issued": "2014-09-09", "msvalidate.01": "D02D46BAEDB3F81FC1B1DE2A8CB69551", "fb": {"admins": 1549080028, "app_id": 134067973330252}, "date": "Tue, 09 Sep 2014 10:28:02 -0400"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd4fa\"", "article_summary": "Study: Bullying By Siblings May Double Risk Of Depression, Self-HarmBy Nicole TayCommonHealth internWhen I was growing up, I used to complain about the loneliness of being an only child.\nThis British-based study comes on the heels of similar findings in an American study last year.\nIs sibling bullying just a harmless rite of passage \u2014 or can it actually entail developmental repercussions?\nFurther reading:Study: Bullying Toll May Linger For Years, Leading To \u2018Substantially\u2019 Worse HealthBullying At Home Aggressive Siblings Hurt Mental Health, Study Finds\nAnd from the abstract:The population-attributable fractions suggested that 13.0% of depression and 19.3% of self-harm could be explained by being the victim of sibling bullying if these were causal relationships."}
