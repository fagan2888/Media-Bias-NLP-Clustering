Sarah LaTourette, R-Bainbridge, and David Hall, R-Millersburg.\n\nOhio Right to Life has lobbied for the bill and included it in its legislative agenda for 2015.\n\n\u201cThe right to life is one that belongs to every American,\u201d Katie Franklin, the director of communications for Ohio Right to Life, told The Daily Signal. \u201cWe want to protect the most vulnerable among us.\u201d\n\nFranklin said she hopes the bill will help \u201ceducate and spread awareness\u201d about Down syndrome.\n\n\u201cPeople with Down syndrome face extraordinary discrimination,\u201d said Franklin. \u201cBut I think there\u2019s a move in society to do what we can to embrace these people as normal people who just happen to have an extra chromosome.\u201d\n\nFranklin and LaTourette both lamented how many of these lives are lost to abortion.\n\n\u201cSadly, many women turn to abortion when they discover their unborn child might have Down syndrome,\u201d LaTourrette said in a statement. \u201cHaving worked in the adoption field, I know firsthand that there are plenty of alternatives to abortion that respect the value of life. I am proud to introduce legislation that will end this horrific form of discrimination. This is a small step in ensuring the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness for all individuals\u2014not just the \u2018perfect\u2019 or the born.\u201d\n\nKellie Copeland, the executive director of NARAL Pro-Choice Ohio, told the Cleveland Plain Dealer that the law would impede the relationship between a woman and her doctor.\n\n\u201cMedical decisions have to be made in these cases by women and their physicians,\u201d said Copeland. \u201cThe idea that any piece of legislation could take into account all the factors in a medical diagnosis is absurd.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Charlotte Lozier Institute, a pro-life research organization, several studies show that the abortion rate for pregnancies with a Down syndrome diagnosis can range from 61 percent to 93 percent, depending on factors such as income level and religious beliefs.\n\nAbout 6,000 babies with Down syndrome are born each year in the United States.\n\nNorth Dakota is the only state that bans abortion based on genetic abnormalities such as Down syndrome. North Dakota also prohibits abortions based on the gender of the child.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The bill seeks to outlaw diagnosis-based abortions.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The bill seeks to outlaw diagnosis-based abortions.", "title": "Ohio Bill Would Ban Abortion of Down Syndrome Babies", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/403ultrasound.png", "updated_time": "2015-04-03T17:32:39+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1BWIQ5K"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The bill seeks to outlaw diagnosis-based abortions.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/403ultrasound.png"}, "title": "Ohio Bill Would Ban Abortion of Down Syndrome Babies", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "Protecting Life", "published_time": "2015-04-03T16:46:06+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-03T17:32:39+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Abortion, prolife, prochoice, Down syndrome, ohio abortion bill"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde74a\"", "article_summary": "A bill has been introduced in the Ohio legislature that would prohibit abortion based on a fetal diagnosis of Down syndrome.\nOhio Right to Life has lobbied for the bill and included it in its legislative agenda for 2015.\nNorth Dakota is the only state that bans abortion based on genetic abnormalities such as Down syndrome.\n\u201cThe right to life is one that belongs to every American,\u201d Katie Franklin, the director of communications for Ohio Right to Life, told The Daily Signal.\n\u201cSadly, many women turn to abortion when they discover their unborn child might have Down syndrome,\u201d LaTourrette said in a statement."}
