After years of failed efforts to derail Obamacare in the courts and on Capitol Hill, Republicans say the president is getting his comeuppance for ignoring their past warnings about the program.\n\nRelated: Obamacare Falls Short on Sign-Ups While Co-Op System Crumbles\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just one more example of a deeply flawed federal law,\u201d Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-TN), chair of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, said in an interview on Tuesday. \u201cAnd what we should be doing is thinking of ways of replacing it with a law that offers more choices and lower costs to consumers, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\nSo far, eight of the 23 health insurance cooperatives originally formed as an alternative to private insurers operating on the government\u2019s exchange have announced they will close their doors by the end of the year. Those eight are in Colorado, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, New York, Nevada, Tennessee and Oregon. There are strong indications that other co-ops will close as well as the Obamacare signup period begins shortly.\n\nAll the co-ops received 15-year loans of different amounts to provide subsidized health insurance to poor and low-income Americans and to encourage competition with private, for-profit insurance companies. At least a half million Americans will lose their coverage by the end of the year and will have to find replacement policies \u2013 probably with higher premiums and deductibles.\n\nMoreover, more than $900 million of the original $2 billion in federal loans to the co-ops to help them get off the ground has been lost, according to media reports.\n\nRelated: Democrats Begin the Long, Tortuous Retreat from Obamacare\n\nSen. John Cornyn (R-TX), the Majority Whip, said that the \u201cwasted $900 million\u201d is part of an \u201call-too-common feature\u201d of a health care system that \u201cjust isn\u2019t working the way it was advertised.\u201d And Sen. John Barrasso (R-WY), another member of the GOP leadership, insisted that only one of the remaining co-ops \u2013 in Maine \u2013 looks financially healthy enough to survive another year of operation. \u201cIt shows that the president didn\u2019t understand the economics of his own health care law or how healthcare works in America,\u201d Barrasso said in an interview.\n\nAlarmed by these serious shortcomings, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), which oversees Obamacare, issued warning letters earlier this year to 11 of the co-ops, placing them under special scrutiny and requiring that they produce a plan of \u201ccorrective action.\u201d\n\nSome of the co-ops responded by announcing they were going out of business beginning in February when a program that served residents of Iowa and Nebraska announced it was shuttering its doors. Late last month, the nation\u2019s biggest co-op in New York -- one with more than 150,000 members -- announced it was shutting down, shocking many insurance and health policy analysts.\n\nRelated: Obamacare Gap Traps Millions With Coverage Who Can\u2019t Afford Care\n\nLast Friday, the co-ops in Colorado and Oregon announced they too were closing at the end of the year, providing added worry for the administration. CMS declined to respond to a request for an interview or comment yesterday.\n\nA little history: The non-profit, consumer operated health plans were added to the law in 2009 as an alternative to a government-controlled \u201cpublic plan option\u201d that many liberal Democrats had favored but that didn\u2019t pass muster with Republicans and some Democrats. The co-ops were designed to expand the coverage options beyond high-powered private insurers and provide more affordable alternatives and discounts.\n\nPart of the blame for failure rests squarely with the co-op officials who pursued dubious business models and marketing tactics that attracted few enrollees and sometimes led to even higher premiums than those being offered elsewhere. But it\u2019s also true that the co-ops were set up for failure by a series of operating restrictions that were written into the law at the behest of traditional insurers.\n\nFor example, the law bars co-ops from using any federal loan funds for marketing expenses. And it mandates that a majority of their enrollment come from individuals and small businesses, rather than from more profitable large-employer market, according to a recent analysis by the Commonwealth Fund.\n\nRelated: Obamacare\u2019s Dirty Secret: 31 Million Still Can\u2019t Afford Treatment\n\nObamacare also requires that the first loans be repaid within five years, a timeframe that was inadequate for the co-ops to build up their markets, according to the analysis. And federal policy makers subsequently cut the co-op loan budget by two-thirds, \u201cleaving funding at levels far below what experts told officials would be needed to ensure that the plans were adequately capitalized,\u201d the report stated.\n\nOfficials of the financially strapped co-ops have also complained about receiving low payments from an ACA program called \u201crisk corridors,\u201d which was designed to protect participating insurers against heavy losses in case of excessive claims by older and sicker patients requiring costly medical treatment. Companies that were hard hit with claims theoretically could draw down money from a fund while other insurers who did far better than projected would pay into the fund.\n\nIn June 2014, the Obama administration floated an idea for shifting funds from other areas of the budget to beef up funding for \u201crisk corridors\u201d to meet the growing demands of insurers who were losing money. However, House and Senate Republicans balked at the idea, denouncing it as a \u201cbailout\u201d for insurance companies and a contravention of Congress\u2019s spending authority.\n\nSen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL) and Rep. Fred Upton (R-MI), chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, warned newly confirmed Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell in a letter that implementing the new rule \u201cwould constitute an unlawful transfer of potentially billions of taxpayer dollars to insurers.\u201d\n\nRelated: How Scrapping the Cadillac Tax Will Drive Up Health Care Costs\n\nThe Obama administration announced on October 1 of this year that the ACA had collected only enough revenues to provide 12.6 percent of the $2.87 billion that the insurers were seeking.\n\nKelly Crowe, CEO of the National Alliance of State Health CO-OPs, said in a statement last week, \u201cIt is no coincidence\u201d that the announced closings of co-ops \u201ccome on the heels\u201d of the recent notice that only 12.6 percent of the 2014 risk corridor funding will be paid to insurers.\n\n\u201cMany of the co-ops now closing were well on their way to longer term financial sustainability, but few businesses can sustain hits like the co-ops and other small and new insurance companies have endured from unexpected risk adjustment obligations and much lower-than-promised risk corridor payments,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThough federal regulators have taken some modest steps to ease co-ops short-term financial burdens, a firmer commitment to fulfill the obligations of the ACA\u2019s risk programs is needed to provide stability to the marketplaces,\u201d she added.\n\nBut the Republicans are unmoved by the co-ops\u2019 pleas for more \u201cbailouts.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll we said was that the program should be budget neutral,\u201d Sen. Barrasso said in an interview.\n\n\u201cThere should not be subsidies by the government. If there are certain insurance companies that \u2013 based on who they insured and what they charged for premiums \u2013 did well, then whatever money came in can be paid out -- but no more.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The financial crisis sweeping through a network of 23 non-profit insurance plans creat", "title": "GOP Faults Obama and the ACA for Failure of Healthcare Co-ops", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/10/21/GOP-Faults-Obama-and-ACA-Failure-Healthcare-Co-ops", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/07062012_Obamacare_Protesters_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/10/21/GOP-Faults-Obama-and-ACA-Failure-Healthcare-Co-ops", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/07062012_Obamacare_Protesters_article.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@ericpianin"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "The financial crisis sweeping through a network of 23 non-profit insurance plans creat", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "All the co-ops received 15-year loans of different amounts to provide subsidized health insurance to poor and low-income Americans and to encourage competition with private, for-profit insurance companies.\nHowever, House and Senate Republicans balked at the idea, denouncing it as a \u201cbailout\u201d for insurance companies and a contravention of Congress\u2019s spending authority.\nThere are strong indications that other co-ops will close as well as the Obamacare signup period begins shortly.\nIf there are certain insurance companies that \u2013 based on who they insured and what they charged for premiums \u2013 did well, then whatever money came in can be paid out -- but no more.\u201d\nFor example, the law bars co-ops from using any federal loan funds for marketing expenses."}
