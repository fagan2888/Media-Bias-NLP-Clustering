PUEBLO, Colo. (AP) — The Rocky Mountain Farmers Union has been chosen for a pilot federal program putting farmers in contact with markets close to home.

The program uses $850,000 in federal funds matched by $2 million in private contributions to hire regional coordinators. The program launched by the U.S. Department of Agriculture is called Levering Investment for Network Coordination.

Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack tells the Pueblo Chieftain (http://tinyurl.com/zgu8xz3 ) there is growing demand for local food and the department wants to encourage more people to become farmers.
