The average DAPA eligible individual has a 10th grade education,\" Heritage Foundation Senior Fellow Robert Rector testified. \"Assuming all DAPA eligible individuals receive legal status, cash payments from [the Earned Income Tax Credit] and [the Additional Child Tax Credit] to DAPA recipients would equal $7.8 billion per year.\"\n\nRector did also note that DAPA recipients would pay $7.2 billion a year in Social Security, Medicare and income taxes, but by law, all of those Social Security and Medicare taxes must go to the Social Security and Medicare trust funds to pay for future Social Security and Medicare benefits for DAPA recipients. Rector estimates that DAPA recipients will consume $1.3 trillion in Social Security and Medicare benefits over their lifetimes.\n\nThe costs of Obama's amnesty will only become larger if DAPA recipients are ever made eligible for Obamacare benefits. Under Obama's current amnesty program, DAPA recipients only receive Social Security Numbers, work permits, and drivers licenses. But if they were to ever be given permanent legal residence, then they would also be eligible for Obamacare, which Rector estimates would cost tax payers another $14 billion per year.", "article_metadata": {"description": "And if they were ever to get Obamacare, that tab would rise to $22 billion..05/26/2016 3:35:20AM EST.", "author": "Conn Carroll", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "And if they were ever to get Obamacare, that tab would rise to $22 billion.", "title": "Conn Carroll - Study: Obama's Amnesty To Cost Taxpayers $7.8 Billion A Year", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/conncarroll/2015/03/17/study-obamas-amnesty-to-cost-taxpayers-78-billion-a-year-n1971967", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/295/debb599d-4740-4955-98db-9283f19cc10e.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "And if they were ever to get Obamacare, that tab would rise to $22 billion.", "title": "Conn Carroll - Study: Obama's Amnesty To Cost Taxpayers $7.8 Billion A Year", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/conncarroll/2015/03/17/study-obamas-amnesty-to-cost-taxpayers-78-billion-a-year-n1971967", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/295/debb599d-4740-4955-98db-9283f19cc10e.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Study: Obama's Amnesty To Cost Taxpayers $7.8 Billion A Year, Conn Carroll, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdb5b\"", "article_summary": "Under Obama's current amnesty program, DAPA recipients only receive Social Security Numbers, work permits, and drivers licenses.\nPresident Obama's latest executive amnesty program will cost taxpayers $7.8 billion a year a Heritage Foundation scholar told the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform Tuesday.\nThe costs of Obama's amnesty will only become larger if DAPA recipients are ever made eligible for Obamacare benefits.\nRector estimates that DAPA recipients will consume $1.3 trillion in Social Security and Medicare benefits over their lifetimes.\n\"Assuming all DAPA eligible individuals receive legal status, cash payments from [the Earned Income Tax Credit] and [the Additional Child Tax Credit] to DAPA recipients would equal $7.8 billion per year.\""}
