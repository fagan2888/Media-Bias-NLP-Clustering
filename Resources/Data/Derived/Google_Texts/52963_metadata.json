So Moreno, a 40-year-old brokerage representative in Keller, Texas, lured his girlfriend in April to a Dallas mansion, where Prosecco, champagne flutes and flowers awaited her. This was followed by an elegant restaurant dinner.\n\nRelated: The 5 Worst Money Mistakes of Millionaires\n\nThat wasn\u2019t all. Hiding behind a row of bushes next to the photographer to make sure it all went off without a hitch was Michael Bloomberg (no, not the former mayor of New York City), owner of The Romance CEO. Moreno paid Bloomberg $1,750 for his proposal-planning services and an extra $2,150 for the gifts and services of various vendors. \u201cI was very happy with the way it turned out,\u201d Moreno said.\n\nFor many of today\u2019s soon-to-be-hitched couples, the once-clever, \u201cWill you marry me?\u201d message tucked inside a fortune cookie simply won\u2019t do. Instead, in the spirit of Kanye West\u2019s opulent proposal to Kim Kardashian, many young men are feeling the pressure to do it up in a grand style. West flew Kardashian on her birthday to San Francisco\u2019s AT&T park, which he had rented, brought in her entire family and hired a 50-piece orchestra to play one of his songs. That has spurred a new industry of wedding proposal planners who execute intricate plans intended to win a beloved\u2019s heart.\n\nBloomberg said every person who\u2019s being proposed to deserves \u201ca story to tell.\u201d A full service package, for which he handles all the details \u2013 ideal, he says, for the busy executive or professional athlete \u2013 can run $4,800.\n\nRelated: 13 Mind-Bogglingly Weird Weddings\n\nMichele Velazquez\u2019s husband proposed to her on a sunset cruise, even though she doesn\u2019t like boats. This led her to realize that men need help in this area, so she founded The Heart Bandits in Los Angeles, Calif., four years ago. She now has coordinators in 14 cities in the U.S. and has planned roughly 1,000 proposals.\n\nSocial media \u201cplays a huge role\u201d in the demand for her services, Velazquez said. A proposal, once private, is now broadcast on YouTube, Facebook and Twitter. \u201cWhen someone proposes in a crazy way, a million people see it the next day,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s changed the expectations.\u201d\n\nMost of her clients are affluent and spend anywhere from $3,000 to $43,000 on a proposal.\n\nOne man recently spent $42,000 to rent a private penthouse in Chelsea, N.Y., that overlooks the city. For his proposal experience, he ordered specially-made cherry blossom replica trees, a huge ice sculpture, crystals hanging with photos of the couple, a harpist, and a catered dinner with a full bar.. Velazquez also once transformed a San Francisco room to a winter wonderland for a woman proposing to her girlfriend; the scene resembled Vermont, where the two met on a ski trip.\n\nRelated: Nothing Says \u2018I Love You\u2019 Like Smart Financial Planning\n\nMany people feel that a lavish wedding proposal is a way to demonstrate commitment, says Velazquez. It also sets the bar for the main event: Someone who\u2019s spent $43,000 on a marriage proposal clearly won\u2019t have a simple wedding.\n\nThe presumption, of course, is that the woman will say yes. Most couples have already discussed marriage and sometimes have even set a date before the official proposal happens. The marriage proposal is a way to introduce an element of surprise.\n\n\u201cThere are girls tapping their toe and looking at their watch and saying, \u2018Why haven\u2019t you proposed yet?\u2019\u201d said Sarah Pease, who oversees proposal planning for Brilliant Events in New York, where she executes 7 to 10 proposals a month in the busy season.\n\nHer proposals have ranged from a \u201ctakeover\u201d of the end of the musical \u201cWicked\u201d \u2013 where the man proposed on center stage accompanied by soloists \u2013 to a proposal on the French Alps, where the rose petals alone cost more than $5,000. There was also the $50,000 proposal aboard a rented aircraft carrier.\n\nRelated: Nothing Says \u2018I Love You\u2019 Like Smart Financial Planning\n\nStephanie Coontz, author of Marriage, a History, and director of research at the Council on Contemporary Families, said that, unlike a generation ago when women often felt compelled to marry for economic reasons, they no longer crave it or need it. As a result, there\u2019s a sense for men that \u201cif you want a really desirable woman, you\u2019ve got to talk her into it and knock her off her feet,\u201d she said. But she prefers the old-fashioned approach and feels that lavish proposals, \u201cblasted all over\u201d are a waste of money.\n\nIf you agree but still want an unforgettable proposal, less expensive options are also available. The Yes Girls charge $199 to provide ideas that future grooms can execute themselves. Bloomberg charges $250 for a one-time consultation.\n\nJudging from his fianc\u00e9e\u2019s reaction, Moreno \u2013 who took his girlfriend to Dallas to pop the big question \u2013 felt the money was well spent. Expecting a low-key proposal in front of her family, Yuri Veliz was \u201cblown away\u201d by what he\u2019d planned. She said the \u201cvery classy and impeccably beautiful\u201d setting was beyond her dreams. \u201cIt was the most amazing night of my life so far.\u201d\n\nThe only drawback? It threatens to overshadow their small destination wedding. \u201cI think my big day won\u2019t be as beautiful as that night was,\u201d Veliz said.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "For many of today\u2019s soon-to-be-hitched couples, the once-clever \u201cwill you marry me\u201d message tucked inside a fortune cookie simply won\u2019t do.
