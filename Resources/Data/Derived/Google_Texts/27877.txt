It’s not just the failed Obamacare rollout that’s ‘on him.’

Late Night with Jimmy Fallon entertained an Obama impersonator Thursday night who reiterated the actual president’s public contrition over the health care law’s early troubles. But if former White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel had the mantra of never letting ‘a serious crisis go to waste,’ this fictional president didn’t let a chance to apologize stop at just one apology.

“There are lot of other things I’m pretty sorry about, too,” the character said. “And if you don’t mind, I’d just like to take this time to apologize for all of them.”

Among the items for which President Opology took the blame: those FiveFingers shoes “with the individual toes cut out,” and the fact that the new Hunger Games movie wasn’t filmed in 3-D.

During the comedy bit, Fallon also sneaked in a dig at President Obama about his ‘fix‘ for cancelled insurance policies.

“Now the White House is coming out with a way for Americans to bypass the Obamacare website and buy policies directly from insurance companies. It’s part of this crazy new plan called, ‘the way things used to be.’ It’s very tricky.”
