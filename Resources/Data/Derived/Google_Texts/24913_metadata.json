Every stop is the same, with Senator Mary Landrieu surrounded by parish-level or district-level Louisiana politicians, who tell stories about the money that poured into their towns after the senator redirected the spigots.\n\nIn New Roads, a mostly black city north and west of Baton Rouge, the richest tale comes from Gene Allen. He\u2019s the mayor of Ferriday, a poorer, blacker town up the road, and he remembers a time when \u201cwe got our water carried in by buffalo.\u201d He stands on a podium, in the shadow of a Christmas tree, explaining just how his senator saved the town. He doesn\u2019t mention that its population has declined steadily.\n\nThat\u2019s not the point. It\u2019s Landrieu\u2019s turn, anyway, to talk about a town wrenched out of the 19th century. \u201cFor a decade, they had brown water comin\u2019 out of their taps,\u201d says the senator, pacing across a small section of the podium. \u201cI don\u2019t think Governor Jindal showed up once. Did he ever show up?\u201d\n\n\u201cBill Cassidy has been caught in a very big lie \u2026 he\u2019s very little of his own man.\u201d Mary Landrieu\n\nNo!\n\n\u201cNot one time, not one time, did our governor go to this town that has 5000 people, that had brown water comin\u2019 out of the tap,\" Landrieu continues. \"He didn\u2019t go, and I said, well, let me get my little self over to Ferriday, even though it\u2019s a little out of my job description, because we have a lot of people not doin\u2019 their jobs in this state!\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s polite applause from the crowd\u2014louder in the front, where the black folks are sitting, and muted in the back, where white men in camouflage jackets are standing, arms crossed, applauding more selectively. They applaud when Landrieu describes how she took on a \u201cbig hedge fund from Boston, you can\u2019t even imagine how much money they make,\u201d to save another town\u2019s energy supply. They\u2019re unmoved when Landrieu calls her opponent, local Representative Bill Cassidy, a \u201cshow pony\u201d whose only legislation was handed to him in order to win the election. They don\u2019t even move much when Landrieu attacks Cassidy for \u201cshowing such disrespect to our president.\u201d That\u2019s the line that starts the black voters cheering. But they\u2019re likely cheering from the front row of a farewell tour.\n\nLandrieu is the last white Democratic senator from the deep South, the last remaining Democrat holding statewide office in Louisiana\u2014and she is getting next to zero help from her national party. Since the Nov. 4 election that began the runoff, Landrieu has seen the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee scrap a $2 million ad buy. She\u2019s stood on the Senate floor as 41 fellow Democrats filibustered her bill to force construction of the Keystone pipeline. She\u2019s watched outside spending in the state grow so lopsided in favor of Cassidy that roughly 97 cents of every dollar is paying for an ad against her.\n\nShe is, to put it gracelessly, likely to lose\u2014to become the first incumbent Democratic senator ever to lose in Louisiana. Public polling has her down by an average of 18 points. At a rally in Baton Rouge, Landrieu says that \u201cthe only poll that matters is election day,\u201d words that have rarely been assembled in that order by a candidate who went on to win. The problem is obvious, and awkward to discuss. In 2008, Landrieu won 33 percent of the white vote, more than enough for a November victory. Last month, she won just 18 percent of that vote.\n\n\u201cThe notion, I suppose, on the part of Mary and her campaign, was that they didn\u2019t have to pay particular attention to the white vote as they campaigned for the black vote,\u201d says Elliot Stonesipher, a Shreveport-based pollster and analyst. Like a lot of observers, the decision baffled him; it was if Landrieu did not realize she had to win again, to distance herself from the president. \u201cWhen she gave that interview to Chuck Todd, when she said \u2018the South has not always been the friendliest place for African-Americans,\u2019 people talked about that for a good long while.\u201d\n\nThat has left Landrieu far behind a Republican she talks about the way a homeowner might describe a burglar to the police. She accuses him of running on nothing but Obama. That\u2019s certainly the story in TV ads\u2014the Koch network\u2019s Freedom Partners are constantly on air replaying Landrieu\u2019s praise of the Affordable Care Act, and American Crossroads is playing a version of a spot it\u2019s used in other red states, where a girl at a spelling bee spells the senator\u2019s name O-B-A-M-A. At events, voters tell her how the ads have fooled their neighbors\u2014surely she can cut through that.\n\n\u201cFocus on your record,\u201d a voter named Bernadette Powell tells Landrieu at a stop in Hammond. They\u2019re speaking just a few yards away from an air control tower that all the local Democrats credit her with erecting.\n\n\u201cYou would think people would be focused on that,\u201d says Landrieu grimly.\n\nAt every stop, Landrieu tells voters that \u201cthe national election is over.\u201d They are being suckered if they cast an anti-Obama vote. (Most of the voters I talk to pause for a few seconds before appraising the president.) At New Roads, and at other stops, Landrieu derides Cassidy as a do-nothing with a \u201cskimpy\u201d record. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna let people know about this guy and what a fraud he is,\u201d she tells one voter.\n\nWhen we talk, and Landrieu gets to discuss the November showdown over the Keystone pipeline, she closes her eyes. This was her bill; the one she rescued from the Republicans who spent half the Obama presidency using Keystone as a bargaining chip.\n\n\u201cDid the House have several Keystone bills they passed? Yes,\u201d she says. \u201cBut if you look at their bills, it was Keystone plus get rid of the Endangered Species Act; Keystone plus drill in Times Square; Keystone plus drill on top of [Washington Senator and Energy Committee member] Maria Cantwell\u2019s head. The bills were never going anywhere. So [North Dakota Senator John] Hoeven and I, because we\u2019re smart legislators, we sat down, we waited for all the reports to come in\u2014the last one was filed in January\u2014we called the White House, we waited until the report was published, we waited until y\u2019all wrote about it, and finally we said, haven\u2019t we waited long enough.\u201d\n\nLandrieu gets animated as she describes how the Republican House jammed her. \u201c[Cassidy] started running around\u2014oh my God, I better do something!\u201d she says. \u201cSo they took my bill, dusted it a little bit, changed it a little bit, put his name on it, and trotted him out like he passed it. It\u2019s total hogwash.\u201d\n\nThe implication is that voters, if so informed, would remember that their senator was there for them. That\u2019s far from clear. The exodus of white conservatives from the Democratic Party, which spans generations, achieved hyperspeed during the Obama years. Since Obama was inaugurated in 2009, sixteen Louisiana state legislators have switched from the Democratic Party to the GOP. Most of them switched after the May 2010 offshore drilling moratorium began after the Deepwater Horizon disaster gushed oil into the Gulf of Mexico, spilling onto the Louisiana coastline.\n\n\u201cI just didn't feel that my philosophy as a traditional conservative Blue Dog Democrat has a place anymore in the national party,\u201d Representative Bubba Chaney told reporters after his 2011 switch. \u201cThe Republican Party better fits that philosophy and my personal values.\u201d\n\nIn this state, people are often talking about social issues. Often, but not always. In Plaquemine, a town down the road from Baton Rouge, I take a party-switching state senator\u2019s lunch recommendation and head into a diner called Fat Daddy\u2019s. A couple named Dale and Bitsie Stampley tell me, woefully, how they had to leave the Democratic Party that their families had always voted for. They started seeing people who thought \u201cthe government could take care of them,\u201d says Dale Stampley. \u201cYou see people with five, six phones, paid for by the government.\u201d\n\nVoters like the Stampley came to see the Democrats as the party that redistributed their money to the people who had not earned it. The Affordable Care Act became the most painful example\u2014Cassidy never stopped talking about it, and Landrieu could not shake it. Voters were not listening to Landrieu or any Democrat when they talked about the assets they could bring to the state. But they\u2019d been building to that for years.\n\n\u201cAs you travel around, you meet these people who are very dependent on Medicaid, on Social Security,\u201d says former Senator John Breaux, who retired in 2004 and saw his seat won by Republican David Vitter. \u201cThese people could not make it without that. Those are basically Democratic programs, and those same people say, \u2018I don\u2019t want the government to interfere.\u2019 I remember when I chaired the Medicaid committee, I had a woman come up to me and say, \u2018Whatever y\u2019all do make sure the federal government doesn\u2019t take over my Medicare.\u2019\u201d\n\nI tell Breaux that this anecdote\u2019s become famous, and widespread. \u201cIt happened to me first!\u201d he says. \u201cIt happened to me a thousand times.\u201d\n\nAnd it has happened most dramatically in Acadiana, the southwest parishes of Louisiana where generations of Cajun whites voted for people like Breaux. They used to vote for Landrieu. In 2002, she won St. Martin Parish, on the edge of Cajun country, by 12 points. In 2008, she beat a weaker Republican with a marginally better statewide vote\u2014but she only won St. Martin by 6 points.\n\nThis November, Landrieu lost St. Martin by seven points. In the first round, she took only 36.5 percent of its vote. I ask her why voters like these have abandoned the Democrats. She pivots to say that Rob Manness, a Tea Party candidate who ran third in the primary, ran strong in those parishes.\n\n\u201cRob Manness was the man who he said he was. He was a man, who was truthful about his career, and his background, and his service. Bill Cassidy has been caught in a very big lie \u2026 he\u2019s very little of his own man. He\u2019s very much a creation of the Republican spin machine.\u201d\n\nAfter following Landrieu to a few more campaign stops I decided to see the state\u2019s other Democratic survivor who is also expected to lose. Edwin Edwards, who was elected to Congress when Lyndon Johnson was president and won four terms as governor, taking the last one against David Duke. (The Klansman had to leave his legislative seat to run. It was conquered by a young Republican Rhodes scholar named David Vitter.) Edwards had gone to jail on corruption charges and re-emerged as a rascal icon. At age 87, he\u2019d become the party\u2019s quixotic candidate in Cassidy\u2019s open seat. Edwards\u2019s fans had made it out to a country club, to see him debate Garret Graves, a Jindal administration coastal policy director expected to win easily. Edwards is given to rambling, and repeating lines, but he's perfectly comfortable telling generalities about what Democrats stood for.\n\n\u201cIf there was no government, kids would still be working in coal mines,\u201d he says. \u201cWe got to recognize, being irresponsible may make you poor, but being poor does not necessarily mean being irresponsible.\u201d\n\nWhen the debate ends, Edwards is swarmed by supporters. They are noticeably aged. A younger crowd sticks around to congratulate Graves, who\u2019s happy to pronounce the end of the opposition in Louisiana.\n\n\u201cThe national Democrat [sic] Party has not looked back,\u201d says Graves. \u201cThey\u2019ve continued to move further and further left, which is simply not the ideology of the people of south Louisiana. I think on this current track that it looks like the days of Southern Democrats are truly done with.\u201d He makes an offhand mention of one of several Edwards biographies that some voters, just a few steps away, are asking the candidate to sign. \u201cThe Last Hayride has been written, and it\u2019s not going to be revised.\u201d\n\nLouisiana\u2019s next chapter will be written by reliable Republicans, who, like Vitter, are more circumspect about what they say, and less interested in showing off what they brought up. Landrieu often accuses Cassidy of \u201ctrying to run out the clock.\u201d This is impossible to deny; he did not face reporters after Monday\u2019s debate with Landrieu. He scrapped his Wednesday campaign appearance on such short notice that, as night fell in Shreveport, nearly a hundred conservatives walked into a Baptist Church still expecting to meet him.\n\nThey\u2019re offered consolation prizes. They get to hear from former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum, who won the state\u2019s 2012 presidential primary (\u201ceverything except one little parish,\u201d he says, referring to the one that makes up New Orleans), from black Republican convert C.L. Bryant, and from Cassidy\u2019s wife, Laura. She\u2019s as adept at sticking to a message as her husband. Maybe more so.\n\n\u201cThis past week, President Obama endorsed Mary Landrieu,\u201d says Laura Cassidy. \u201cHer chief of staff said that if she gets back to the Senate, she\u2019ll vote with Barack Obama\u2014how often?\u201d\n\nNinety-seven percent of the time!\n\n\u201cOne more time, a little bit louder!\u201d\n\nNinety-seven percent of the time!\n\n\u201cYou know, my husband was glad to meet a youngster, about nine years old. He said, \u2018Mom, you can\u2019t vote for Mary Landrieu,\u2019\u201d Cassidy says, readying the punch line\u2019s final reprise. \"She said, \u2018Why?\u2019 He said, \u2018Mary Landrieu votes with Barack Obama 97 percent of the time.\u201d\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "David Weigel", "description": "But Mary Landrieu and Edwin Edwards are raging against the dying of the light.", "parsely-section": "politics", "og": {"site_name": "Bloomberg.com/politics", "description": "But Mary Landrieu and Edwin Edwards are raging against the dying of the light.", "title": "The Last Days of Democratic Politics In Louisiana Are Here", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/features/2014-12-05/democratic-politics-is-about-to-go-dark-in-louisiana", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/i4JTv51MwvUo/v8/-1x-1.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"description": "But Mary Landrieu and Edwin Edwards are raging against the dying of the light.", "title": "The Last Days of Democratic Politics In Louisiana Are Here", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/features/2014-12-05/democratic-politics-is-about-to-go-dark-in-louisiana", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/i4JTv51MwvUo/v8/-1x-1.jpg", "site": "@bpolitics", "card": "summary"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"status": "But Mary Landrieu and Edwin Edwards are raging against the dying of the light."}, "parsely-title": "The Last Days of Democratic Politics In Louisiana Are Here", "parsely-tags": "End of an Era,Region: Global,Page: feature", "parsely-post-id": "NG3VFE6JTSE801", "parsely-author": "David Weigel", "date": "2014-12-05T10:50:02.320Z", "keywords": "End of an Era", "parsely-type": "post", "news_keywords": "End of an Era", "parsely-pub-date": "2014-12-05T10:50:02.320Z", "parsely-image-url": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/i4JTv51MwvUo/v8/-1x-1.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "parsely-link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/features/2014-12-05/democratic-politics-is-about-to-go-dark-in-louisiana"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb055\"", "article_summary": "She is, to put it gracelessly, likely to lose\u2014to become the first incumbent Democratic senator ever to lose in Louisiana.\nSince Obama was inaugurated in 2009, sixteen Louisiana state legislators have switched from the Democratic Party to the GOP.\nThe exodus of white conservatives from the Democratic Party, which spans generations, achieved hyperspeed during the Obama years.\nA couple named Dale and Bitsie Stampley tell me, woefully, how they had to leave the Democratic Party that their families had always voted for.\n\u201cThe Republican Party better fits that philosophy and my personal values.\u201dIn this state, people are often talking about social issues."}
