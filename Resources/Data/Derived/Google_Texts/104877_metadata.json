Just over a third of respondents said they \u201cstrongly agreed\u201d that the \u201cdark net should be shut down.\u201d Another 35 percent agreed \u201csomewhat\u201d with the statement.\n\nAccording to law enforcement officials, the dark Web and tools such as encryption have helped criminals and terrorists \u201cgo dark,\u201d or hide from authorities. They have pushed tech companies to offer greater access to secure data.\n\nBut the tech community has resisted, arguing that such tools are essential to protecting global digital security and online privacy.\n\nThe Centre for International Governance Innovation (CIGI), a Canadian think tank focusing on Internet governance, commissioned the Ipsos poll.\n\nIn posing the question, Ipsos noted that the dark Web can help protect human rights activists, dissidents under oppressive regimes and whistleblowers. But it also pointed out that the anonymous network helps hide underground marketplaces that sell illicit items, including weapons, narcotics and child pornography.\n\nThe responses varied by country, but all 24 showed solid support for shuttering the dark Web.\n\nIndonesia was the country most in favor of eradication, with 85 percent support. India, Mexico, China and Egypt were close behind, all at 79 percent or above.\n\nSweden, South Korea and Kenya all tied at 61 percent for the lowest support for axing the dark Web.\n\nThe United States was in the middle of the pack, at 72 percent.\n\nIpsos said the poll had a range of error within each country of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The findings come amid an intense debate over technology that lets users communicate clandestinely.", "description": "The findings come amid an intense debate over technology that lets users communicate clandestinely.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Cory Bennett", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The findings come amid an intense debate over technology that lets users communicate clandestinely.", "title": "Poll: Strong global majority backs dark Web ban", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/274570-poll-strong-global-majority-backs-dark-web-ban", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-03-29T15:46:04-04:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-03-29T15:46-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/274570-poll-strong-global-majority-backs-dark-web-ban", "dcterms.date": "2016-03-29T13:06-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Cory Bennett", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",,", "article": {"published_time": "2016-03-29T13:06:01-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-29T15:46:04-04:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/274570-poll-strong-global-majority-backs-dark-web-ban", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The findings come amid an intense debate over technology that lets users communicate clandestinely.", "card": "summary", "title": "Poll: Strong global majority backs dark Web ban"}, "dcterms.title": "Poll: Strong global majority backs dark Web ban"}, "article_summary": "According to law enforcement officials, the dark Web and tools such as encryption have helped criminals and terrorists \u201cgo dark,\u201d or hide from authorities.\nRoughly 7 in 10 people favor shutting down the so-called dark Web \u2014 an anonymous online network favored by activists and dissidents, as well as criminals \u2014 according to a new poll.\nSweden, South Korea and Kenya all tied at 61 percent for the lowest support for axing the dark Web.\nIn posing the question, Ipsos noted that the dark Web can help protect human rights activists, dissidents under oppressive regimes and whistleblowers.\nThe responses varied by country, but all 24 showed solid support for shuttering the dark Web."}
