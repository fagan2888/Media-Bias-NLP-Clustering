Iowa hosts the first presidential caucus in 2016.\n\nThe committee also has an office in New Hampshire, home to the first primary in 2016.\n\nTodd said on \"Today\" that there \u201cis a big disconnect\u201d between the GOP donor establishment, that favors Jeb Bush, Mitt Romney and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, and the grassroots.\n\n\u201cThe establishment, aka the donors, they want one of those three. The grassroots are not interested any of those three. They are very unpopular with the people that actually vote in primaries, the people who vote in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Sessions: Crime surge crashes into election, 'people not safe in their homes' FBI Director James B. Comey had an odd plea to Washington reporters when he met them earlier this month. Please, he said, write about the surge of murders rocking the nation's cities.\n\nAnd, he added, the establishment is worried that conservatives will take over the primary and caucus process. \u201cThey are afraid of what the grassroots might select, whether it\u2019s a Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, et cetera,\u201d he said.\n\nPaul Bedard, the Washington Examiner's \"Washington Secrets\" columnist, can be contacted at pbedard@washingtonexaminer.com.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The growing grassroots movement behind neurosurgeon and Obamacare critic Dr. Ben Carson\u2019s budding 2016 presidential bid has won the recognition of \u201cMeet the Press\u201d host Chuck Todd, who said Thursday that the race among conservative activists is between Carson and Sen.
