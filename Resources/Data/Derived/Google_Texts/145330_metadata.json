Scott Walker was sworn in for his second term as the 45th Governor of Wisconsin on Monday. In his inaugural address, Walker drew comparisons between Washington, D.C. and Wisconsin, hinted at expanding the state\u2019s school choice program, and boasted about reforming state government.\n\nWalker\u2019s inaugural address was comparable to the speech he gave in November after being elected for the third time in four years. He focused on his successes as governor and vowed to \u201cmove Wisconsin forward.\u201d\n\nThe governor \u2013 who is considering a run for president \u2013 made it clear that Wisconsin is headed in the right direction, while the opposite is the case in the nation\u2019s capital.\n\n\u201cIn contrast to the politicians along the Potomac, we get things done here in the Badger state,\u201d Walker said in his speech. \u201cThere is a clear contrast between Washington and Wisconsin.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been good stewards of the taxpayers\u2019 money and lowered their tax burden as well,\u201d Walker continued. \u201cWe\u2019ve shown why the founders of this great nation looked to the states\u2013and not the federal government\u2013as the source of hope for this exceptional country. We will not let them down.\u201d\n\nMuch of the distinction with Washington was centered on the proper role of government. Walker argued that people, not government, create jobs and that the power should be in the hands of the people, not big government special interests \u2013 a tip-of-the-hat to his signature legislation known as Act 10, which reformed collective bargaining for public employees in Wisconsin.\n\nWalker then looked to the future in his speech, outlining some of his major priorities in the upcoming legislative session.\n\nFirst the governor hinted at expanding school choice.\n\n\u201cWe will ensure every child \u2013 regardless of background or birthright \u2013 has access to a quality education,\u201d Walker said. \u201cFor many, like my sons and me, it is in a traditional public school. For others, it may be in a charter, a private, a virtual or even a home school environment. Regardless, we will empower families to make the choice that is right for their sons and daughters.\u201d\n\nReforms to how state government functions were also central to Walker\u2019s priorities.\n\n\u201cWe will reduce the size and scope of government to match the will of the people. State agencies will be merged to make them more effective, more efficient, and more accountable to the public,\u201d the governor announced. \u201cWe will continue to weed out waste, fraud, and abuse. Budgets will be set based on the taxpayers\u2019 ability to pay and not on the government\u2019s ability to spend.\u201d\n\nWalker ended his speech around the theme of living the American Dream \u2013 once again, similar to his November speech.\n\n\u201cWorking together, I believe we can create a state that is even better than the Wisconsin we grew up in,\u201d he said. \u201cHelp us realize that dream of freedom and prosperity for all.\u201d\n\nNewly and reelected members of the State Assembly and Senate were also sworn in on Monday after the inaugural event for Walker, Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch, Attorney General Brad Shimel and State Treasurer Matt Adamczyck.\n\nAssembly Speaker Robin Vos (R-Rochester) echoed Walker\u2019s sentiment for government reform.\n\n\u201cIn this session, we won\u2019t look to create new government programs,\u201d Vos said in a statement. \u201cInstead, we must think of ways to reduce the size of government by consolidating agencies and eliminating programs to make government more efficient and effective.\n\n\u201cWe must not take the easy route and just propose additional ways to spend more taxpayer dollars,\u201d he continued. \u201cInstead, we must work to find ways to curb government spending and reduce bureaucracy.\u201d\n\nSenate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald (R-Juneau) told reporters after members were sworn in that a school accountability bill would be his chamber\u2019s first priority, saying he hopes to get something done in the month of January. He also told reporters that he is supportive of a Right-to-Work bill, but stopped short of saying that a bill would be introduce right away.\n\nDuring his speech to the new Senate, he said he hopes to build on the successes of last session.\n\n\u201cAs we embark on the process of crafting the next biennial budget, we will ensure that the best interests of Wisconsin\u2019s taxpayers remain a priority,\u201d Fitzgerald said. \u201cMeanwhile, we will strive to reform our education system, defend public safety, invest in infrastructure, and prove that we are responsible stewards of Wisconsin\u2019s finances.\u201d\n\nBoth the Assembly and Senate are scheduled to be on the floor on Wednesday, January 7th, but it is not anticipated that any major bills will be introduced.\n\nOriginally appeared on maciverinstitute.com.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Gov.
