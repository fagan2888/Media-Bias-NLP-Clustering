On Thursday, reports surfaced that Trump\u2019s own campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, had assaulted a female reporter who was trying to ask his boss a question after a press conference Tuesday night, leaving her bruised and shaken.\n\nThis should not surprise anybody who has been paying attention to the Trump campaign. The billionaire GOP presidential frontrunner has not just been exploiting, but fomenting anger among his supporters. And while he\u2019s usually careful to step right up to the line of endorsing violence against the protesters who regularly interrupt his rallies, on more than a few occasions, he has crossed it.\n\nRelated: Thousands of Defense Jobs Could Be Lost if Trump Gets Elected\n\nFor example:\n\n-- At a rally in Iowa early this year, Trump was warned in advance that there might be tomato-throwing protesters in attendance. So early in his remarks, he said, \u201cThere may be somebody with tomatoes in the audience. So if you see somebody getting ready to throw a tomato, knock the crap out of them, would you? Seriously. Okay? Just knock the hell \u2014 I promise you, I will pay for the legal fees. I promise, I promise. It won\u2019t be so much \u2019cause the courts agree with us too.\u201d\n\n-- When members of his audience get physical with protesters, Trump has even brought them up on stage to honor them.\n\n-- At a late February rally, Trump said of one protester, \u201cI\u2019d like to punch him in the face, I tell ya.\u201d He added that in the \u201cold days\u201d protesters would have been \u201ccarried out on stretchers.\u201d It was clear from the context that he felt a certain nostalgia for those times.\n\n-- Last week, when one of his rallies in Michigan was interrupted by a protestor, Trump said, \u201cGet him out. Try not to hurt him. If you do I\u2019ll defend you in court.\u201d He later regaled the crowd with the story of how his supporters \u201ctook out\u201d a protester at a rally in New Hampshire, saying it was \u201creally amazing to watch.\u201d\n\nRelated: Obama to Trump \u2013 Thanks for Making Me Look Good\n\n-- This isn\u2019t new. Way back in November, after a protester was assaulted by members of his audience, Trump said, \u201cMaybe he should have been roughed up, because it was absolutely disgusting what he was doing.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not hard to make the connection between Trump\u2019s rhetoric and 78-year-old John McGraw, the supporter who blindsided a young African-American protester, Rakeem Jones, with a right hook on Wednesday night.\n\n\u201cYes, he deserved it,\u201d McGraw said in an interview with Inside Edition afterward. \u201cThe next time we see him we might have to kill him.\u201d\n\nFor the record, after Jones was punched in the face, he was thrown to the ground by a swarm of sheriff\u2019s deputies and handcuffed. McGraw was allowed to return to his seat and remained there for the rest of the event. No action was taken against McGraw until the next day, when he was charged with assault and battery and disorderly conduct.\n\nRelated: A Trump Presidency Could Give ISIS a Foothold in the US\n\nThe sense that violence against people who disagree with Trump is legitimate appears to have permeated his campaign staff as well. Lewandowski, the campaign manager who appears to have manhandled Breitbart.com reporter Michelle Fields on Tuesday night, went on the attack Thursday, despite the fact that the incident was corroborated by a Washington Post reporter, and further by audio tape obtained by Politico.\n\nLewandowski, on his personal Twitter account, labeled her an \u201cattention seeker\u201d and received backup from the Trump campaign. Campaign spokesperson Hope Hicks said in a statement that the Trump campaign did not believe the assault \u2013 now reported by two major news organizations \u2013 had ever happened.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The billionaire GOP presidential frontrunner has been not just exploiting, but fomenting anger among his supporters.
