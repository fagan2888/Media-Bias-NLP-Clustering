Republicans serving on two key committees have introduced legislation that would allow the House or Senate to authorize a lawsuit against the Obama administration. The ENFORCE the Laws Act is the latest GOP response to complaints that President Obama is willfully ignoring or altering federal law. As examples, Republicans have cited the several delays to ObamaCare provisions, and Obama\u2019s 2011 decision to delay deportation proceedings against illegal immigrants who have not committed a crime.\n\nThis is the second time that Republicans have tried this stunt. The STOP Act went nowhere, so House Republicans want the power to sue President Obama for doing his job. Their claim is that the head of the executive branch of our government does not have the authority to make decisions in implementing the law.\n\nIt\u2019s time for a basic civics lesson for Republicans. The legislative branch passes laws. The executive branch implements laws. What House Republicans are suggesting is that President Obama does not have the constitutional authority to implement any law without their consent. Courts have ruled for decades that the executive branch has discretionary powers when it comes to implementing the law. The legal standard is that the law has to be implemented in a timely fashion. President Obama has not refused to implement any laws.\n\nRepublicans claim that Obama is engaging in constitutional overreach, but this piece of legislation in the House suggests that it is the Republicans who are trying to tilt the balance of constitutional powers. They are trying to take power away from the executive branch, and render President Obama politically paralyzed.\n\nObama has promised a year of action. The idea that the president might use his powers to accomplish anything has sent Republicans fleeing to the courts, where they are literally trying to sue Barack Obama for being president.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In their quest to stop President Obama from doing anything, House Republicans are trying to pass a new bill that would give them the authority to sue Obama for being president.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Jason Easley", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "In their quest to stop President Obama from doing anything, House Republicans are trying to pass a new bill that would give them the authority to sue Obama for being president.", "title": "Republicans Propose New Bill That Would Sue Obama For Being President", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2014/03/05/republican-propose-bill-sue-obama-president.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/obama-oath.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-03-05T09:25:55+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "ENFORCE Act,Republicans sue Obama,obama constitutional overreach,president obama,obama,Featured News,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,barack obama,hillary clinton,bernie sanders,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "Featured News", "published_time": "2014-03-05T09:24:54+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-03-05T09:25:55+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf1e0\"", "article_summary": "In their quest to stop President Obama from doing anything, House Republicans are trying to pass a new bill that would give them the authority to sue Obama for being president.\nThe STOP Act went nowhere, so House Republicans want the power to sue President Obama for doing his job.\nWhat House Republicans are suggesting is that President Obama does not have the constitutional authority to implement any law without their consent.\nThey are trying to take power away from the executive branch, and render President Obama politically paralyzed.\nThe idea that the president might use his powers to accomplish anything has sent Republicans fleeing to the courts, where they are literally trying to sue Barack Obama for being president."}
