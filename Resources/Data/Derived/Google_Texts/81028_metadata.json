He also said 11 people had been killed in the attack, that\u2019s one more than the figure released Tuesday.\n\nThe attack Tuesday struck Istanbul\u2019s historic Sultanahmet district, which is popular with tourists. Thomas de Maiziere, the German interior minister, said it did not appear that Germans were deliberately targeted.\n\n\u201cIn the current stage of the investigation, there is no indication that the attack was targeted against Germans,\u201d he said. \u201cI see no reason to refrain from trips to Turkey.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, Turkish authorities identified the bomber as Nabil Fadli, who they said was an ISIS member. They initially said he was Syrian. Then, they said he was Saudi. On Wednesday, Turkish news reports said Fadli was a 28-year-old Saudi national who had applied for asylum in Turkey. They said he was identified by his fingertips at the site of the explosion.\n\nFive people have been arrested in connection with the attack: Ala said one person has been arrested; later, Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said four others had been detained.\n\nAla said the bomber wasn\u2019t on a list of suspected ISIS members in either Turkey or other countries.
