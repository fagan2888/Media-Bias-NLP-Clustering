ObamaCare). In addition, SB 77 repeals a provision requiring the governor to comply with certain requirements before expanding Medicaid. Also included is the provision that Medicaid expansion will be repealed if federal funding decreases from the Affordable Care Act\u2019s funding rates.\n\nAlso included is the provision that Medicaid expansion will be repealed if federal funding decreases from the Affordable Care Act\u2019s funding rates.\n\nCalling it one of the most important bills this legislative session, Davis said that the state has lost $624 million since January 1, 2014 and full Medicaid expansion is the most fiscally sound way to go. The bill would cost the state $50 million annually, however $575 million would come back to Utah by 2022, according to Davis.\n\nPaul Gibbs, a member of the LDS Dems Caucus\u2019 executive committee, said people have died while the debate about Medicaid expansion has raged on and many more are suffering. \u201cThis is desperately needed. This is the right thing to do,\u201d said Gibbs. \u201cI can tell you the state of Utah has unequivocally, objectively broken its promise to be a family-friendly state.\u201d\n\nEvelyn Everton, director of the Utah chapter of Americans for Prosperity, urged lawmakers to opt out of Medicaid expansion. \u201cThe reality is that Utahns can\u2019t afford to expand Medicaid. There\u2019s just no magic formula for making this troubled federal program balanced. We\u2019ve seen programs like Arches collapse under the weight of not being able to continue these services without the funding they were promised. It\u2019s definitely not going to help Utah\u2019s health care costs for all Utah families as well.\u201d\n\nThe Right Reverend Scott Hayashi, bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Utah, said the time for action is right now, not down the road. \u201cWe have waited for three years for conversations to take place and we have heard things such as \u2018Well, let\u2019s see what the Supreme Court does.\u2019 The Supreme Court ruled, keeping the Affordable Care Act. The latest thing I\u2019ve heard is \u2018Let\u2019s wait for the next president.\u2019 While we\u2019re waiting for all these people, all these things to happen, more and more people of Utah are simply dying. I think that is a disgrace.\u201d\n\nSenator Daniel Thatcher (Republican \u2013 West Valley City) has concerns about the bill, but believes it should go forward in the process. \u201cI don\u2019t think we can have a third year pass where we do nothing. I can\u2019t promise that I can support this on the floor, and even if we do [pass the bill] I don\u2019t know where we\u2019re going to come up with the money in a year where we\u2019ve got a budget shortfall in the General Fund. But I do think that we need to continue the discussion on this. I do believe that we need to continue moving forward.\u201d\n\nSenator Mark Madsen (Republican \u2013 Saratoga Springs) also has concerns, but chose to vote the bill out so the discussion can proceed. \u201cI think this is an important conversation. I will not be able to vote on it on the floor unless there are some other boundaries so that we don\u2019t have an open-ended exposure like this.\u201d Senator Steve Urquhart (Republican \u2013 St. George) made a similar statement.\n\nSenate Budget Chairman Lyle Hillyard (Republican \u2013 Logan), the sole dissenting vote, worries about controlling costs. \u201cI guess my concern is I\u2019ve talked to legislators in other states who have adopted this full program. The general statement I get from those who will seriously talk to me about it is \u2018Be very careful, because it explodes.\u2019 You know, you project what the costs are going to be and the benefits are going to be and then, lo and behold, instead of having 50,000 people sign up it\u2019s 150,000.\u201d\n\nThe proposal, one of many this session, is expected to face an uphill battle going forward. \u201cIf there\u2019s a will, there\u2019s a way to do it. That\u2019s what we lack in the state Legislature right now, I believe, is the will to move forward to try to take care of 110,000 individuals who would be eligible,\u201d said Davis.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.2.8", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "SB 77 \u2013 Medicaid Expansion Proposal, sponsored by Senator Gene Davis (Democrat \u2013 Salt Lake City), was passed out of the Senate Judiciary, Law Enforcement, and Criminal Justice Committee on a 5-1 vote.\nA bill proposing full Medicaid expansion cleared its first hurdle Tuesday in what will most likely be a very difficult gauntlet.\nAlso included is the provision that Medicaid expansion will be repealed if federal funding decreases from the Affordable Care Act\u2019s funding rates.\nPaul Gibbs, a member of the LDS Dems Caucus\u2019 executive committee, said people have died while the debate about Medicaid expansion has raged on and many more are suffering.\nCalling it one of the most important bills this legislative session, Davis said that the state has lost $624 million since January 1, 2014 and full Medicaid expansion is the most fiscally sound way to go."}
