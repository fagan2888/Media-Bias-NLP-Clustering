Walton ruled that two lawsuits by True the Vote and Linchpins of Liberty, along with 41 other conservative organizations, were moot because the IRS took steps to address the scandal and \u201cpublicly suspended its targeting scheme.\u201d\u2019\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a disappointing ruling because it basically leaves targets of bad behavior by the IRS without a remedy,\u201d Hans von Spakovsky, senior legal fellow at The Heritage Foundation, told The Daily Signal.\n\nA federal judge sided with the IRS today and dismissed the case filed by conservative groups targeted by the tax agency.\n\n>>> Commentary: The Wrongdoers at the IRS Get Away With It\n\nWalton, who was appointed by President George W. Bush, decided that because the organizations eventually won tax-exempt status, they had remedied any wrongdoing. (His two rulings are below.)\n\n\u201cWe are stunned by today\u2019s judgment,\u201d True the Vote founder Catherine Engelbrecht said. \u201cThe notion that the IRS can target Americans for years because of their political beliefs is reprehensible.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe notion that the IRS can target Americans for years because of their political beliefs is reprehensible.\u201d\u2013@TrueTheVote founder Catherine Engelbrecht\n\nEngelbrecht also told The Daily Signal:\n\nThe court acknowledges in its opinion that the IRS did in fact target True the Vote for our perceived political beliefs, but then it holds that neither the agency nor the individual IRS agents or officers are responsible for this unconstitutional conduct. Right now, we are considering all legal options and will announce our next steps very soon.\n\n>>> Commentary: Politico Found Lois Lerner. So Why Can\u2019t the U.S. Attorney in Washington?\n\nTrue the Vote and Linchpins of Liberty filed suit on the grounds that IRS officials improperly held up their tax-exempt status for several years.\n\nTexas-based True the Vote, a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization that seeks to stop voter fraud, waited three years before the IRS awarded it tax-exempt status. It first applied in 2010 and received word in 2013.\n\nTennessee-based Linchpins of Liberty was created to mentor high school and college students in the continuing relevance of America\u2019s founding principles. The IRS delayed the group\u2019s application for 501(c)3 tax-exempt status for nearly three years, founder Kevin Kookogey recalled in an on-camera interview early this year.\n\n\u201cThe court appears to believe that tossing a life-preserver to a swimmer who has already drowned can magically revive the dead.\u201d\u2013Linchpins of Liberty founder Kevin Kookogey\n\n\u201cObviously, this ruling is stunning, and we intend to appeal,\u201d Kookogey told The Daily Signal today, adding:\n\nThe court appears to believe that tossing a life-preserver to a swimmer who has already drowned can magically revive the dead, or that the government\u2019s promise not to hurt anyone in the future releases it from liability for past harms.\n\nAlthough True the Vote, Linchpins of Liberty and more than three dozen other groups argued there is no guarantee the IRS would not target conservative groups again, Walton ruled that the \u201cprospect of future harm is speculative.\u201d\n\nVon Spakovsky, the Heritage legal fellow, disagreed.\n\n\u201cGiven the unapologetic behavior of Lois Lerner and other IRS officials, and their total lack of remorse, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s \u2018speculative\u2019 that this could happen again in the future,\u201d he said.\n\n>>> No Apologies: Lois Lerner Breaks 16-Month Silence on IRS Scandal\n\nKookogey said he was baffled by the judge\u2019s logic.\n\n\u201cMy constitutional rights were violated at the moment the IRS first began to unlawfully obstruct and delay my application for tax-exempt status back in 2011,\u201d Kookogey said. \u201cGranting my status three years later \u2014 after we filed the complaint and moments before the government was required to file an answer \u2014 does not undo that harm or render our claims moot.\u201d\n\nWalton also refused to grant a request from True the Vote to require Lerner and other IRS officials to pay a fine for delaying the group\u2019s tax-exempt status and subjecting it to additional scrutiny.\n\nLerner was the head of the IRS division that oversaw tax-exempt organizations. She resigned last year and twice has refused to testify before Congress.\n\nAlthough the groups filed suit before they were granted tax-exempt status, Walton cited a remedy in place from Congress that called for organizations seeking such status to go to court for it. That provision, he said, should have been used.\n\nIn addressing True the Vote\u2019s request, Walton said because the IRS eventually granted it tax-exempt status, the group no longer had grounds for the case.\n\n>>> Commentary: More Evidence of Lois Lerner\u2019s Liberal Bias\n\nKookogey, a Nashville lawyer, told The Daily Signal that Linchpins of Liberty lost a $30,000 grant, a significant part of his own business and opportunities to mentor students because of the IRS\u2019 actions. The agency\u2019s delay in granting tax-exempt status also prevented Kookogey from fundraising and building the organization, he said:\n\nIf this ruling is permitted to stand, it will embolden a government which has already exceeded its limits to believe that it can violate the natural rights of its citizens until caught, at which point it must only apologize, \u2018fix\u2019 the problem, and move on to the next victim.\n\nDuring Lerner\u2019s tenure, conservative and tea party groups such as True the Vote waited years for the IRS to rule on their applications. The IRS targeting scandal prompted more than a dozen hearings by congressional investigators.\n\nCongress learned this summer that emails Lerner sent during the time of the targeting had vanished because a computer drive crashed.\n\nTrue the Vote v.
