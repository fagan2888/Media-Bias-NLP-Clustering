(KTVI)-This week, the U.S. Supreme Court will hear the case of Sebelius v. Hobby Lobby Stores. The Hobby Lobby is a chain of craft supply stores headquartered in Oklahoma City with 18,000 employees in almost 600 stores, including five in the St. Louis area. The chain is owned by the Green family, who are evangelical Christians. They say the Affordable Care Act requirement that employee health insurance plans cover birth control violates their religious beliefs. Specifically, they object to the inclusion of the so-called morning after pill, which the Green’s say amounts to abortion. So, Hobby Lobby has taken their case to the U.S. Supreme Court.

Green isn't alone. Some St. Louis area businesses have raised the same objection. So, can a corporation have religious beliefs? If so, do those beliefs trump the law? Charles Jaco sits down with Elizabeth Sepper , an Associate Professor of Law at Washington University. She specializes in the law, ethics, and medicine and has written about this issue. Her article, “Contraception and the Birth of Corporate Conscience”, appears in the American Journal of Gender, Social Policy, and the Law.
