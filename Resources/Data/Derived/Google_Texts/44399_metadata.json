Buck picked up the style at skating rinks and on playgrounds, before he transferred to a fine arts high school to study hip-hop and ballet, and dancing became his life. Now 26, he performs at benefits and works with children to advocate the arts in education.\n\nBuck, born Charles Riley, was raised and educated in the Memphis public school system. He recalled the experience this morning without nostalgia. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t all that good for me. I got made fun of a lot because I have big ears. Everybody called me Dumbo. This was before I was dancing. I\u2019d be so focused on trying to handle that situation, I didn\u2019t really listen to the teachers.\u201d\n\nFive years after moving to Los Angeles to work the Santa Monica pier, Buck is an artist-in-residence at the Aspen Institute, where he spoke this morning with Gardner at the Aspen Ideas Festival (hosted by the Aspen Institute and The Atlantic)\u2014alongside actress Alfre Woodard and dancer Damian Woetzel\u2014about fostering this sort of intelligence through exposure to the arts.\n\nThe theory was developed in 1983 by Howard Gardner, who is now the Hobbs Professor of Cognition and Education at Harvard. It defines intelligence expansively, as the ability to create an effective product or offer a service that is valued in a culture; a set of skills that make it possible for a person to solve problems in life. It's a broader definition than many curricula address, and some of the multiple intelligences regularly go unstimulated and underdeveloped in traditional schools.\n\nASPEN, Colo. \u2014 It has been three years since the spectacular video of Lil Buck dancing to Yo-Yo Ma brought jookin\u2014which draws from hip-hop, ballet, jazz, and modern dance\u2014into mainstream consciousness. Ma would later call Buck a genius; and, he is. According to the theory of multiple intelligences , which posits nine distinct dimensions, Buck is clearly off the charts in intelligences like spatial, musical/rhythmic, and bodily/kinesthetic.\n\nIn the nineteenth century, Gardner explained, arts education\u2014drawing, music, literature, drama\u2014were seen as instrumental. But today, \u201cThere\u2019s a heightened pressure for proof that it\u2019s worth having something in the curriculum. With so many disciplines struggling for space, the arts can be an endangered species.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about a way of educating that involves artistic sensibilities\u2014artistic habits of mind. The ability to re-assess and to imagine.\"\n\nIf you ask Americans if liberal arts are important, Gardner continued, they say yes. But in terms of budgets, what gets cut first is not \u201ccore subjects\u201d or even athletics.\n\nA decreased emphasis on arts, explained Damian Woetzel, who was a principal dancer for the New York City Ballet before becoming director of the Aspen Institute Arts Program, \u201ccame about in a frame of increased emphasis on test scores and utility\u2014the market economy becoming a marketing society. Everything is about what you\u2019re going to get,\u201d in readily quantifiable terms.\n\nWoetzel describes an erroneous dichotomy, wherein arts aren\u2019t a separate part of education. \u201cIt\u2019s a false proposition that we have to take the arts away to fund something else.\u201d\n\nWoetzel's vision is \u201cto give kids the tools to become adults who are creative, adaptable, and collaborative, expressive\u2014capable of having their eyes and ears and senses alive.\u201d\n\nIt was Woetzel who programmed Lil Buck\u2019s now-viral performance of \u201cThe Swan\u201d with Ma in 2011. In addition to the subsequent project Lil Buck at le Poisson Rouge, the two also collaborate in bringing arts into school, working directly with kids.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not talking about making sure that everybody has private music lessons,\u201d Woetzel said. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about a way of educating that involves artistic sensibilities\u2014artistic habits of mind. The ability to re-assess and to imagine. To be in a science class and not think it\u2019s about memorization entirely,\u201d but to imagine its applications.\n\nDispatches from the Aspen Ideas Festival.

They think it\u2019s touchy feel-y. But it\u2019s undeniable what music, painting, [and] movement do to the brain. It becomes more receptive to scientific ideas.\u201d\n\nWoodard says pushback to investment in the arts is at times puritanical. \u201cIt can\u2019t be that good, because it makes us feel free and happy.\u201d\n\nBut art facilitates the learning of everything else.\n\n\u201cYou cannot be an innovator in any category,\u201d Woodard said, \u201cunless that creative instinct is exercised.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The best education enables artistic voice and creative habits of mind.", "author": "James Hamblin", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "The best education enables artistic voice and creative habits of mind.", "title": "There Is No Education Without the Arts", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2014/06/AP13040207574_1/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2014/06/why-kids-need-arts-in-education/373640/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/jameshamblinmd"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "\u201cIt can\u2019t be that good, because it makes us feel free and happy.\u201dBut art facilitates the learning of everything else.\nNow 26, he performs at benefits and works with children to advocate the arts in education.\nThe theory was developed in 1983 by Howard Gardner, who is now the Hobbs Professor of Cognition and Education at Harvard.\nIn the nineteenth century, Gardner explained, arts education\u2014drawing, music, literature, drama\u2014were seen as instrumental.\nIt becomes more receptive to scientific ideas.\u201dWoodard says pushback to investment in the arts is at times puritanical."}
