That letter lists five allegations with the investigation concluding there were no violations of the law, though it noted the department\u2019s administrative policies were insufficient with regard to one allegation.\n\nThe city hired Renold Irizarr, a retired lieutenant for the Sunnyvale Police Department, to conduct the investigation.\n\nCity officials last week announced an outside investigation into allegations against the Hollister fire chief found the official did not commit any improprieties. Hollister officials received the commissioned investigative report last Wednesday after placing O'Connor on paid administrative leave about six weeks ago due to a then-undisclosed personnel matter in the department. City officials have confirmed the allegations surrounded O\u2019Connor\u2019s shifting of hours in recent months away from overtime pay for full-time employees to more hours for reserve firefighters, the ranks of which include O\u2019Connor\u2019s son, Ryan.\n\nAs written, the allegations included:\n\n\u2022 Violations of the Fair Labor Standard Act relating to overtime to reserve firefighters\n\n\u2022 Violations of the Affordable Care Act regarding part-time employees working full time without medical benefits\n\n\u2022 Falsifying time cards\n\n\u2022 Conflict of interest issues between O\u2019Connor and his son\n\n\u2022 Lack of accountability of the reserve firefighters by the chief\n\nWhile the investigator noted \u201cno violations found\u201d for all five allegations, he called policies relating to the fifth accusation \u201clacking or incomplete.\u201d O\u2019Connor returned to work Thursday, while the city\u2019s response to the allegations pointed out that the department would generate written policies to address insufficiencies surfacing from the accountability accusation.\n\nO'Connor had been named permanent fire chief in January after about eight months in the interim chief role. He has been with the department for more than 25 years. Capt. Leo Alvarez took on the acting chief role Oct. 22 when O\u2019Connor was placed on paid leave.\n\nCouncil members have been quiet on it but acknowledged they wanted O\u2019Connor to reduce overtime costs, which came to $522,000 in 2013-14. City officials this fiscal year budgeted fire department overtime at $100,000 with the temporary staffing estimate at $190,000, according to Brett Miller, director of administrative services. Meanwhile, the city is in the midst of negotiations with the fire union, and those talks went to mediation.\n\nMayor Ignacio Velazquez has pushed for the cuts to overtime costs in the fire department and all other departments in the city, he has said.\n\nO\u2019Connor was in a meeting Monday morning and could not be reached immediately.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Free Lance News", "description": "A letter detailing unfounded allegations against Fire Chief Mike O\u2019Connor\u2014and the city\u2019s responses\u2014includes accusations of nepotism, falsifying time cards and violations of federal laws pertaining to compensation for reserve firefighters.", "title": "City letter notes unfounded claims against fire chief", "url": "http://www.sanbenitocountytoday.com/news/local_politics/city-letter-notes-unfounded-claims-against-fire-chief/article_b0c034ca-7f0c-11e4-9463-efb5975bdaed.html", "image": {"width": 487, "identifier": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/sanbenitocountytoday.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/8/09/809a0368-7f0f-11e4-82ee-87b3530fa8c5/5485fa795570f.preview.jpg?resize=487%2C630", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@tweetmeme", "card": "summary", "creator": "@"}, "description": "A letter detailing unfounded allegations against Fire Chief Mike O\u2019Connor\u2014and the city\u2019s responses\u2014includes accusations of nepotism, falsifying time cards and violations of federal laws pertaining to compensation for reserve firefighters.", "fb": {"app_id": 170440809698642}, "keywords": "local_politics,breaking,featured", "news_keywords": "local_politics,breaking,featured"}, "article_summary": "City officials last week announced an outside investigation into allegations against the Hollister fire chief found the official did not commit any improprieties.\nA letter detailing unfounded allegations against Fire Chief Mike O\u2019Connor\u2014and the city\u2019s responses\u2014includes accusations of nepotism, falsifying time cards and violations of federal laws pertaining to compensation for reserve firefighters.\nCity officials this fiscal year budgeted fire department overtime at $100,000 with the temporary staffing estimate at $190,000, according to Brett Miller, director of administrative services.\nThe city released a letter to the attorney who submitted the complaint on behalf of the department\u2019s firefighters union.\nO'Connor had been named permanent fire chief in January after about eight months in the interim chief role."}
