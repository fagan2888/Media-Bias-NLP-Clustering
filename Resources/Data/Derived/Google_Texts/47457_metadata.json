In many cases, women who are victims of rape or domestic violence often have no choice in whether or not they will use protection during sex, and thus are unable to protect themselves from HIV or other STD transmission.\n\nThough the AIDS stigma has decreased since its peak in the 80s and 90s, in most parts of the world, HIV-infected people \u2014 particularly gays and women \u2014 are still looked down upon and treated with prejudice. This makes it more difficult for them to seek treatment, find support, and cope with the disease. According to WomensHealth.gov, up to one in four women postpone medical treatment because they fear the threat of partner violence, or because they face obstacles like family or depression.\n\n\u201cPeople may be afraid that they will be perceived as being gay, promiscuous, a sex worker, or drug user if it is revealed that they are HIV positive,\u201d Laurel Sprague, research director of advocacy group Sero Project, said last year.\n\nWomen with HIV also carry the extra burden of potentially transmitting the disease to future children, even if it wasn\u2019t their fault they became infected. According to WomensHealth.gov, other obstacles specific to women include not having the same access as men to health care resources, as well as being in abusive relationships \u2014 with partners that have violent reactions \u2014 that make them fearful of telling the truth.\n\nFortunately, the Affordable Care Act provides more coverage to people living with HIV/AIDS \u2014 as well as people who are at the highest risk, particularly low-income people.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "hiv/aids, women with hiv, national women's hiv/aids awareness day", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "March 10 is National Women and Girls\u2019 HIV/AIDS Awareness Day, a time to reflect on the ways we can help our fellow females battle this disease.", "title": "National Women's HIV/AIDS Awareness Day Sheds Light On Challenges Women Face", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/national-womens-hivaids-awareness-day-2015-shedding-light-unique-challenges-women-324858", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/03/07/educating-women-about-hivaids.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "March 10 is National Women and Girls\u2019 HIV/AIDS Awareness Day, a time to reflect on the ways we can help our fellow females battle this disease.", "title": "National Women's HIV/AIDS Awareness Day Sheds Light On Challenges Women Face", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/national-womens-hivaids-awareness-day-2015-shedding-light-unique-challenges-women-324858", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/03/07/educating-women-about-hivaids.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/03/07/educating-women-about-hivaids.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-03-07T17:08:28-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-07T17:08:27-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "March 10 is National Women and Girls\u2019 HIV/AIDS Awareness Day, a time to reflect on the ways we can help our fellow females battle this disease."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbadb\"", "article_summary": "Since 2006, National Women and Girls HIV/AIDS Awareness Day has strived to educate people around the world about the specific plights women with HIV face on a daily basis, from prejudice to violence and lack of care.\nWomen with HIV also carry the extra burden of potentially transmitting the disease to future children, even if it wasn\u2019t their fault they became infected.\nAccording to WomensHealth.gov, up to one in four women postpone medical treatment because they fear the threat of partner violence, or because they face obstacles like family or depression.\nThis makes it more difficult for them to seek treatment, find support, and cope with the disease.\nFortunately, the Affordable Care Act provides more coverage to people living with HIV/AIDS \u2014 as well as people who are at the highest risk, particularly low-income people."}
