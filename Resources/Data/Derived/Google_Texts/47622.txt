Cynthia Hannon is accused of hiring a man to brutally attack her ex-husband so brutally that he winds up in the hospital.

A Wallingford woman is accused of hiring a man to brutally attack her ex-husband, but the man she hired was a police informant, according to police.

Cynthia Hannon, 59, of Wallingford, is accused of plotting a vicious attack on her former husband, then hiring the man for $25,000 to carry it out and put her ex in the hospital, according to police.

She went so far as to give the man her exâ€™s photo, provide details about his daily routine and make part of the payment, according to police.

After the attack, she was going to pay him the rest of the money, police said.

But the man was a police informant and Wallingford police arrested Hannon at 10 p.m. on Tuesday.

She was charged with criminal attempt at assault in the first degree and conspiracy to assault in the first degree.

Hannon was held on a court-ordered $100,000 and arraigned this morning in Meriden Superior Count.

No information was available on the court docket indicating whether she has an attorney.
