After the president\u2019s heavily debated submission of his use-of-force resolution to Congress \u2014 which the White House insists is simply a courtesy rather than an actual requirement \u2014 a bipartisan coalition of doves has rejected the president\u2019s argument that military intervention is the only valid option available after Syria allegedly crossed the \u201cred line\u201d on weapons of mass destruction use the administration had set for the region.\n\nWithout Congress\u2019s approval, the president\u2019s options become increasingly unpalatable. Citing former President Bill Clinton\u2019s intervention in Kosovo \u2014 in which President Clinton engaged in air strikes against the Serbian military without Congress\u2019s explicit approval before deployment and despite the House\u2019s rejection of a use-of-force resolution in four separate votes a month after hostilities began \u2014 President Obama asserts he can commit the military to the intervention as a reflection of his authority as supreme commander of the nation\u2019s defenses.\n\nThere\u2019s one huge difference, though: the Clinton intervention in Kosovo was supported by the United Nations. Prior to the intervention, the U.N. Security Council passed resolutions 1160 (1998), 1199 (1998) and 1203 (1998), all calling on the Serbian government to stop hostilities in Kosovo and to allow U.N. personnel free access for the purposes of investigating violations of international humanitarian laws. Even though the U.N. resolution authorizing force came after Clinton\u2019s, it was issued with the understanding that a Serbian failure to adhere with the previous resolutions was the sole rationale for the Security Council\u2019s \u2014 and by extension the Clinton administration\u2019s \u2014 actions.\n\n\n\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsor\n\nThe United States, standing alone\n\nPresident Obama has no such backing from the U.N.. With the results of the U.N. chemical weapons inspections yet to be released, and with Russia threatening to veto any Security Council resolution condemning Syria, the United States risks being in violation of the United Nations Charter with its plans to attack Syria. The United States, following its intelligence assessment on a reported chemical attack in the suburbs of Damascus on Aug. 21, feels that a punitive act against the Syrian regime\u2019s actions is not only prudent, but in keeping with the expressed purposes of the U.N. toward preserving the peace.\n\nThe Obama administration asserts that the inspectors\u2019 report, due in two weeks, is irrelevant on the basis of its own intelligence. Citing what it says is positive proof, the administration argues it has the needed legal justification to proceed and that U.N. tests will only confirm whether chemical weapons were used and not who used them.\n\n\u201cBy the definition of their own mandate, the U.N. can\u2019t tell us anything that we haven\u2019t shared with you this afternoon or that we don\u2019t already know,\u201d said Secretary of State John Kerry during a recent press hearing.\n\nMany, including some members of Congress, are urging the administration to slow down and wait for the report.\n\n\u201cI would strongly encourage the Obama administration and any other countries considering a military strike to wait for the results of the U.N. secretary general inspection,\u201d said Amy Smithson, an expert on chemical and biological warfare at the Monterey Institute of International Studies. \u201cIf the U.N. analysis of samples turns out to reveal the use of classic warfare agents believed to be in the Syrian government\u2019s arsenal, like sarin and VX, then the neon light already pointed towards [Syrian President Bashar al-Assad] glows even brighter. The point is: Don\u2019t count the inspectors out.\u201d\n\nAssad ridiculed the accusations of his regime possessing chemical weapons, using them on Syrian citizens and then allowing chemical weapons investigators to examine the site of the reported attack. Other members of the Security Council are either waiting for the inspectors\u2019 report or \u2014 recalling America\u2019s previous insistence on action against Iraq \u2014 are wary and cautious of trusting the U.S. again.\n\n\u201cThe actions of the Assad regime are morally reprehensible and they violate clearly established international norms,\u201d said U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Samantha Power on Thursday. \u201cThe use of chemical weapons is not America\u2019s red line. As President Obama said yesterday, this is the world\u2019s red line. 189 countries, representing 98 percent of the world\u2019s population, and all 15 members of the U.N. Security Council, agree that the use of chemical weapons is abhorrent and we have all collectively approved a treaty forbidding their use even when countries are engaged in war.\u201d\n\nPower concluded:\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, for the past two and a half years, the system devised in 1945 precisely to deal with threats of this nature did not work as it was supposed to. It has not protected peace and security for the hundreds of Syrian children who were gassed to death on Aug. 21. It is not protecting the stability of the region. It is not standing behind now an internationally accepted ban on the use of chemical weapons. Instead, the system has protected the prerogatives of Russia, the patron of a regime that would brazenly stage the world\u2019s largest chemical weapons attack in a quarter century \u2014 while chemical weapons inspectors sent by the United Nations were just across town. And even in the wake of the flagrant shattering of the international norm against chemical weapons use, Russia continues to hold the Council hostage and shirk its international responsibilities, including as a party to the Chemical Weapons Convention.\u201d\n\nThe United States and the United Nations\n\nIf the administration attacks Syria without U.N. approval, the nation will be in abeyance of the U.N. Charter, as defined in Article 2.4:\n\nAll Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.\n\nWith the U.N. thus far only authorizing unarmed observers to Syria, U.S. intervention, in terms of international law, would be an unprovoked act of war against Syria, warranting U.N. intervention against the United States.\n\nIn this lies the rub. The U.N., as it is currently structured, cannot punish or act against the United States. As a permanent Security Council member, the United States has the expressed right to veto any proposed Security Council resolution \u2014 including any punitive actions against itself. This was seen in the 1984 International Court of Justice case The Republic of Nicaragua v. The United States of America, where the ICJ ruled that America\u2019s support of the Contras harmed the Nicaraguan government in defiance of international law.\n\nThe ICJ ruled that the U.S. had violated Nicaraguan sovereignty, illegally used force against Nicaragua, intervened in the internal affairs of Nicaragua, infringed on the nation\u2019s freedom of the high seas and killed or wounded Nicaraguan citizens.\n\nThe United States vetoed all Security Council enforcement of the judgement seven times, rendering the judgement ineffectual in actual intent and essentially nothing more than just a reprimand.\n\nThis came despite the Reagan administration\u2019s open admission that it was indeed working to overthrow the Sandinista government and had lied about this to the ICJ for the sake of defending its case.\n\nAs host nation to the United Nations, the U.S. offers not only police and military protection of its permanent missions and personnel but also the majority of the organization\u2019s funding and peacekeeping strength. The U.N. has neither the political will nor the practical strength to force the U.S. to comply with international law. This creates a problem \u2014 if a party of a law is free to disregard the law, then was it a law in the first place?\n\nWhen the United Nations was formed after World War II in the ashes of the failed League of Nations, it was created with the intent that through the cooperation of the world\u2019s nations, global peace could be achieved and a third World War could be avoided. In reality, the United Nations \u2014 the Security Council, specifically \u2014 has become a private negotiation backroom for the five permanent Security Council members \u2014 the U.S., the United Kingdom, France, China and Russia. Ultimately, international politics as defined by the U.N. has devolved from gestures of global harmony to the bargaining and trading of favors and barbs between the Big Five concerning the fate of the rest of the world.\n\nIn the final analysis, the United States\u2019 reaction to the United Nations is really a reaction to the other permanent Security Council members. While there sometimes may be a sense of fair-play and respect in America\u2019s dealings with the U.N., the U.S. government, historically, sees adherence to U.N. policies and rulings as a voluntary act.\n\nA fine mess\n\nThe U.N. stalemate now centers around the U.S. and Russia, an ally of Syria. \u201cThe Russian side is not blocking the deliberations of other countries within the framework of the United Nations Security Council,\u201d said Dmitri Peskov, the Kremlin\u2019s spokesman, at this week\u2019s G-20 summit, despite the fact that Russia explicitly vetoed a Syrian resolution three times. \u201cIt is trying to encourage its partners, including its partners in Washington, to objectively consider the situation and not to make decisions before the verdict of the U.N. experts who are working in Syria.\u201d\n\nThe fine reality is that, with regard to Syria, the Obama administration is in a \u201cdamned if you do, damned if you don\u2019t\u201d situation. If the administration cancels intervention in Syria, it basically makes its \u201cred line\u201d rhetoric irrelevant and significantly softens the weight the United States carries in directing Middle Eastern affairs. It also exposes the administration to allegations that it was blind to the humanitarian disaster unfolding in the region. If the administration intervenes without U.N. support, it risks military engagement with Iran and Russia while exposing Israel to attacks that the Lebanese militia Hezbollah has threatened to carry out. The U.S. would also have to defend itself against charges of \u201cinternational bullying\u201d by unilaterally attacking a sovereign nation outside the wishes of the international community.\n\nThe greatest potential blowout, however, is if the administration attack Syria without congressional approval. If this happens, it\u2019s almost assured that future negotiations between the White House and Congress \u2014 particularly on gun control, the budget, the debt ceiling and immigration \u2014 would become impassable minefields. Not only would the president lose support in his own party, but it\u2019s reasonable to expect congressional Republicans to use the opportunity to turn their back on the president.\n\nThe administration has roughly indicated it will not proceed in Syria without congressional approval. Deputy National Security Adviser Tony Blinken said Friday that \u201cit\u2019s neither [President Obama\u2019s] desire nor intention to use that authority absent Congress backing him.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter the events of Aug. 21 we reached out to Congress and we had conversations with members of Congress across the country,\u201d he said, \u201cand the one thing we heard from nearly all of them was that they wanted their voice heard and their votes counted.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Even as it waffles on what to do sans congressional approval, the Obama administration says it is prepared to defy the United Nations., Assad, Congress, International Law, Kosovo, military intervention, Obama, Syria, United Nations,", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "Frederick Reese", "og": {"site_name": "MintPress News", "description": "Even as it waffles on what to do sans congressional approval, the Obama administration says it is prepared to defy the United Nations., Assad, Congress, International Law, Kosovo, military intervention, Obama, Syria, United Nations,", "title": "A US Attack On Syria Would Violate The UN Charter", "url": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/us-attack-on-syria-would-violate-the-un-charter/168499/", "image": "http://mnpprodpublic.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/090613_obama_16x9-690x388.jpg", "updated_time": "2013-09-12T09:30:30-05:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Even as it waffles on what to do sans congressional approval, the Obama administration says it is prepared to defy the United Nations., Assad, Congress, International Law, Kosovo, military intervention, Obama, Syria, United Nations,", "creator": "@FrederickReese", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/090613_obama_4x3.jpg", "title": "A US Attack On Syria Would Violate The UN Charter", "site": "@MintPressNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100003161352196}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MintpressNewsMPN", "section": "Foreign Affairs", "tag": "United Nations", "published_time": "2013-09-09T05:00:49-05:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-12T09:30:30-05:00"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0300\"", "article_summary": "The point is: Don\u2019t count the inspectors out.\u201dAssad ridiculed the accusations of his regime possessing chemical weapons, using them on Syrian citizens and then allowing chemical weapons investigators to examine the site of the reported attack.\nIn Washington, President Barack Obama\u2019s plans to punitively attack Syria for alleged chemical weapons use are falling apart before an increasingly recalcitrant Congress.\nA US Attack On Syria Would Violate The UN CharterEven as it waffles on what to do sans congressional approval, the Obama administration says it is prepared to defy the United Nations.\nAs a permanent Security Council member, the United States has the expressed right to veto any proposed Security Council resolution \u2014 including any punitive actions against itself.\nThere\u2019s one huge difference, though: the Clinton intervention in Kosovo was supported by the United Nations."}
