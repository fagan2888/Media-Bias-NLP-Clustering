Martin, who said he is going to be affiliated with MDVIP starting in October 2015.\n\nMartin said in the letter, \"It is important now more than ever to have a physician partner who can put you and your health care first. MDVIP will help protect our doctor-patient relationship and allow me to continue providing you with the personal, proactive care and service you deserve.\"\n\nMartin also stated that in order to provide this care, he will be significantly reducing the size of his practice, as well as charging an annual fee for the wellness program.\n\nThe MDVIP website states that memberships average about $1,800 per year.\n\nPBS News Hour profiled MDVIP in 2012, and interviewed Mark Murrison, MDVIP's president of marketing and innovation.\n\n\"Our doctors are primary care doctors and doctors who have really become frustrated with what has become conveyor belt medicine,\" Murrison told PBS. \"They're seeing 30, 35 patients a day. They're spending less and less time with their patients.\"\n\nMDVIP limits practice size to 600 patients.\n\nThe small size is a perk for Dr. Ramon Solis, a doctor based in Katy, Texas, who was also interviewed by PBS in 2012.\n\n\"With the reduced number of patients that I can see, I am able to return those calls and those labs in a shorter period of time than the typical doctor,\" said Solis.\n\nThe concept of concierge care did not go over well with El Pasoans who spoke with ABC-7.\n\n\"I think any good primary care physician should do that stuff no matter what,\" said Brad Kinyon. \"You shouldn't have to pay the extra $1,800.\"\n\nIvan Enriquez said, \"In a capitalistic society, it's discrimination through economic means.\"\n\nMDVIP offers participating patients 24/7 telephone access, expedited specialist referrals and access to other MDVIP physicians when clients travel.\n\nThey are some benefits that hundreds of El Pasoans conclude are worth the price.", "article_metadata": {"ib-analytics": "data", "description": "Some El Pasoans, like thousands of Americans across the country, are opting to pay more for exclusive care from their doctors.", "generator": "ibPublish 2", "author": "KVIA", "og": {"site_name": "KVIA", "description": "Some El Pasoans, like thousands of Americans across the country, are opting to pay more for exclusive care from their doctors.", "title": "ABC-7 Special Report: Exclusive medical care available in El Paso", "url": "http://www.kvia.com/news/abc7-special-report-exclusive-medical-care-available-in-el-paso/34417582", "image": "http://www.kvia.com/image/view/-/34417812/highRes/1/-/maxh/640/maxw/640/-/3uago3z/-/mdvip-logo-jpg--1-.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.kvia.com/news/abc7-special-report-exclusive-medical-care-available-in-el-paso/34417582", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"app_id": 267142726735477}, "keywords": "el paso, kvia, abc-7, stephanie valle, mdvip, health, care, medical, elite, exclusive, concierge", "google-site-verification": "FmXCwr1av4gq24PL3ICX03jm7sG3X3u3ykkUGmH_Gqw", "news_keywords": "el paso, kvia, abc-7, stephanie valle, mdvip, health, care, medical, elite, exclusive, concierge"}, "article_summary": "\"Our doctors are primary care doctors and doctors who have really become frustrated with what has become conveyor belt medicine,\" Murrison told PBS.\nEL PASO, Texas -With office visit fees, co-pays and deductibles, health care is expensive.\nMDVIP, a program that offers personalized care, has recently expanded to El Paso.\n\"I think any good primary care physician should do that stuff no matter what,\" said Brad Kinyon.\nABC-7 asked Nancy Udell with MDVIP's office in Florida to speak with any of the El Paso doctors about why they transitioned to the program and its benefits."}
