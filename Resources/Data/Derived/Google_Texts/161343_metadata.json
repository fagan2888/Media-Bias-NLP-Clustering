I said it to him a few times,\u201d the NL Rookie of the Year recalled. \u201cHe kept saying, \u2018We\u2019ll see. We\u2019ll see.\u2019\u201d\n\nConcerned about a late-season slump in the 27-year-old right-hander\u2019s first full big league season, Mets manager Terry Collins said deGrom won\u2019t start against Atlanta next week and could have his rotation turn skipped.\n\n\u201cSo I guess we\u2019ve seen now,\u201d deGrom said with a smile before Saturday\u2019s 5-0 loss to the Mets.\n\nThe personable pitcher whose shaggy shoulder-length locks prompted a #HairWeGo promotion campaign, is 13-8 with a 2.64 ERA in 28 starts this year, including 1-2 with a 6.41 ERA and a .330 opponents\u2019 batting average in his past five outings.\n\n\u201cThe location of his pitches is not what it needs to be,\u201d Collins said. \u201cThis guy became extremely successful because of the sink with his fastball, where he got ground balls, and right now he\u2019s getting fly balls \u2018cause everything seems to be moving up.\u201d\n\nWhile deGrom\u2019s fastball averages 96 mph, Collins is concerned about the pitcher\u2019s release point.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been more up in the zone than I want to be,\u201d deGrom said. \u201cNormally I pitch down and then go up when I want to.\u201d\n\nNew York has limited the innings of Matt Harvey and Noah Syndergaard, but deGrom doesn\u2019t have any such restrictions.\n\nHe didn\u2019t pitch between Aug. 7 and 23 last year because of tendinitis in his right rotator cuff. When he returned, he went 3-1 with a 2.25 ERA in six starts.\n\n\u201cI felt really good after that. I think I needed that time last year. There was some shoulder fatigue going on there,\u201d deGrom said. \u201cBut this year I feel fine.\u201d\n\nLogan Verrett, a 25-year-old rookie right-hander who has made two spot starts when Harvey was skipped, will take deGrom\u2019s place Tuesday against Atlanta. Collins said results against the Yankees this weekend will help determine whether deGrom is pushed back or skipped.\n\n\u201cIt can\u2019t hurt,\u201d deGrom said. \u201cThat\u2019s what they chose to do, so that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Jacob deGrom approached Mets pitching coach Dan Warthen in the dugout Friday night.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Jacob deGrom approached Mets pitching coach Dan Warthen in the dugout Friday night.", "title": "DeGrom pushed back by Mets, who think he needs rest", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/sep/19/degrom-pushed-back-by-mets-who-think-he-needs-rest/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/09/19/14196be72e857c2a820f6a706700c264.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/09/19/14196be72e857c2a820f6a706700c264.jpg", "description": "Jacob deGrom approached Mets pitching coach Dan Warthen in the dugout Friday night.", "card": "summary", "title": "DeGrom pushed back by Mets, who think he needs rest"}, "Author": "RONALD BLUM", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "NEW YORK (AP) - Jacob deGrom approached Mets pitching coach Dan Warthen in the dugout Friday night.\n\u201cSo I guess we\u2019ve seen now,\u201d deGrom said with a smile before Saturday\u2019s 5-0 loss to the Mets.\nCollins said results against the Yankees this weekend will help determine whether deGrom is pushed back or skipped.\nWe\u2019ll see.\u2019\u201dConcerned about a late-season slump in the 27-year-old right-hander\u2019s first full big league season, Mets manager Terry Collins said deGrom won\u2019t start against Atlanta next week and could have his rotation turn skipped.\n\u201cThe location of his pitches is not what it needs to be,\u201d Collins said."}
