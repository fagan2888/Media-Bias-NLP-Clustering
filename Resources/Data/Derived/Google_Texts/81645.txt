The Justice Department announced Thursday that the government won’t prevent Native Americans from growing marijuana on reservations, even if the reservation is located in a state where marijuana is illegal.

This ruling will be implemented on a case-by-case basis and tribes must still follow federal guidelines, Timothy Purdon, the U.S. attorney for North Dakota and the chairman of the Attorney General’s Subcommittee on Native American Issues, told the L.A. Times.

This is in line with a 2013 Justice Department policy that promised to stop most federal marijuana prosecutions in states that have legalized the possession or sale of pot. Colorado, Washington, Oregon, Alaska and the District of Columbia have all moved to legalize the drug, though the D.C. law may be scaled back by the so-called “CRomnibus” spending bill.

Some tribes believes marijuana sales could prove to be a good source of revenue, much like the cigarette sales and Native American casinos, but many other tribes are strongly opposed.

Purdon told the L.A. Times that the majority of Native American tribes appear to be against allowing marijuana use on their territory.

Tribes that don’t want to legalize marijuana on their reservations can ask federal officials to enforce the law, he said, otherwise they will remain hands off.

“The tribes have the sovereign right to set the code on their reservations,” Purdon said.

Tribes that choose to allow it will have to meet eight federal guidelines,such as not selling to minors and not transporting it to areas that prohibit it.
