Quote: “I was born and raised on a small farm with five brothers and sisters. We were fiscal conservatives from the day we were born. My parents taught us to believe in two things … No. 1, God is great and prayer works. The other is the American Dream is the greatest opportunity on Earth.”

Jokes: “John Hickenlooper will be a bartender in 2015.”
