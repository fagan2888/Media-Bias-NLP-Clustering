Stepping off the boat in Tallinn, Estonia — a ferry ride from Sweden or Finland or an easy flight from anywhere in Europe — you feel that you’ve traveled farther culturally than you have throughout the rest of Scandinavia. Located about an equal distance from Stockholm and St. Petersburg, Tallinn’s culture is both Nordic and Russian.
