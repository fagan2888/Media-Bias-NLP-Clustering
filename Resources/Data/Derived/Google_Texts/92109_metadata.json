It is happening across America, including in Colorado.\n\nNot long ago, you could graduate from high school and get a good-paying job in Colorado, buy a house, and raise a family. But over the years, the loss of good-paying manufacturing jobs has significantly deteriorated the path to the middle class for many.\n\nBut we have an option to regain our manufacturing prowess and strengthen our middle class once again: home-grown energy.\n\nThe American energy renaissance in Colorado \u2014 from the plains of Weld County to the Piceance Basin of the Western Slope \u2014 is transforming our global economy.\n\nThe increase in domestic production of oil and gas is not only making it cheaper to fuel your car and heat your home, but it\u2019s also reducing the costs of manufacturing in the U.S. In fact, thanks to technological advancements in hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling, it\u2019s now 10 to 20 percent cheaper to manufacture in the U.S. than in major European economies, according to the Boston Consultancy Group (BCG).\n\nThat\u2019s a staggering number. Even more amazing, BCG projects that by 2018, it will be up to 3 percent cheaper to make products here than in China.\n\nThat point cannot be underscored enough: We can finally replace \u201cMade in China\u201d with \u201cMade in the USA.\u201d\n\nAs Brian Dumaine recently wrote in Fortune magazine, \u201cFracking has helped dramatically drive down the price of oil and gas that\u2019s being used in energy intensive industries such as steel, aluminum, paper and petrochemicals. BCG calculates that U.S. industrial electricity prices are now 30 percent to 50 percent lower than those of other major exporters.\u201d\n\nAnd even better for Colorado, which has the lowest energy costs per month of any state, according to WalletHub. Only the District of Columbia is lower.\n\nThis new wave of domestic energy production is an opportunity to change our economic trajectory. It\u2019s time for more businesses to invest in America again and for entrepreneurs to feel comfortable in launching new businesses here.\n\nColorado\u2019s proud history of safe and environmentally sound oil and gas production, as well as manufacturing, makes it the perfect place to make that happen in a way that will benefit and grow the middle class and return it to its rightful place as the foundation of our economy.\n\nA PBS iNews Network report released two years ago, \u201cLosing Ground,\u201d detailed how a loss of manufacturing jobs has hurt Colorado, particularly African-Americans and Latinos. In the late 1960s, Pueblo\u2019s CF&I steel plant supported southern Colorado\u2019s economy with more than 13,000 jobs.\n\nManufacturing companies primarily employed blue-collar workers who sometimes lacked a high school diploma, yet paid $60,000 to $70,000 salaries. Employment as a steel worker or welder was more accessible to Colorado\u2019s workers of color than other occupations. As a result, they were able to join the middle class and enjoy the financial security that comes with it.\n\nBy the 1970s, one in four Latino workers in Colorado held manufacturing jobs, with the manufacturing sector accounting for 14 percent of all jobs in Colorado. This path to middle-class prosperity helped Colorado rank as one of the most equitable states by most measures of social progress during the Civil Rights era.\n\nIn the years since, Colorado fell dramatically behind other states by these same measures. According to the PBS report, African-American and Latino children of former manufacturer workers are less able to attain the same standard of living as their parents. In 2013, manufacturing jobs accounted for only 7 percent of the state\u2019s total. In Pueblo, only one in 10 Latinos currently hold a manufacturing job.\n\nThe loss of thousands of Colorado\u2019s good paying manufacturing jobs \u2014 from companies like Pueblo\u2019s CF&I Steel, Denver\u2019s Gates Rubber Co., Montbello\u2019s Samsonite Corp. \u2014 hurt families of color disproportionately, and now we all battle with the consequences.\n\nBut there is a way to turn this around. A 2011 PwC study concluded that U.S. manufacturing companies could employ 1 million more workers by 2025 due to the benefits from affordable energy and demand for the products used in natural gas extraction. Cultivating oil and gas resources in Colorado will expand the manufacturing sector and reopen routes to middle-class prosperity. A manufacturing renaissance could fuel an increase in socioeconomic equality throughout our communities.\n\nIf we want to do more than just talk \u2014 and actually create a true revival of the middle class and achieve economic equality \u2014 we need to stop sacrificing the ability to regain this lost ground by working against oil and gas development. Let\u2019s move away from the simple indifference and myopic view of our neighborhood that led us down this path and embrace the resurgence of manufacturing jobs through oil and gas development.\n\nThis is not about just oil and gas development, but about what that development \u2014 and the products it produces \u2014 brings to every part of this state. If you truly are concerned about the middle class, it\u2019s foolhardy to ban fracking and oil and gas development. Every ban and over-reaching regulation takes away this opportunity and only bans good-paying manufacturing jobs that rely on Colorado oil and gas.\n\nWe should embrace Colorado\u2019s responsible energy development as a commitment to truly begin to make progress toward economic equality and prosperity for all Coloradans.\n\nDiedra Garcia is president and CEO of the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce of Metro Denver.
