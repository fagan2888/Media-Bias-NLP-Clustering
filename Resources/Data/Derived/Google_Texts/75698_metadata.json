That allows lower premiums for the health insurance.\u201d\n\nVliet adds that HSAs would give patients the flexibility and freedom to spend their healthcare dollars in their HSAs.\n\n\u201cWhat many people don\u2019t realize is that the combination of catastrophic medical insurance with HSAs has been used effectively in the United States prior to ObamaCare to give patient-centered approaches at lower cost,\u201d Vliet explains. \u201cUnder ObamaCare, the Democrats reduced the amount of money that the patients could contribute to their own HSAs and reduced what people could use their HSAs to purchase.\u201d\n\nVliet also likes Trump\u2019s proposal to allow consumers to buy insurance plans across state lines, something many center-right individuals and organizations have been pushing for years.\n\n\u201cIf patients could buy a policy in Mississippi, Alabama or Texas, where the mandated coverage is less [than what other states require] and patients have more flexibility, then they would be spending less money per month on their health care policies,\u201d she adds.\n\nStill, some individuals on the center-right side of things want Trump to offer more details. Yevgeniy Feyman, fellow for and deputy director with the Manhattan Institute\u2019s Center for Medical Progress, calls it a non-plan.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s cobbled together a few, conservative ideas like HSAs and selling insurance across state lines with some arguably liberal ideas,\u201d says Feyman. \u201cHSAs already exist, [and] Trump makes no indication as to what he would actually do with HSAs.\u201d\n\nFeyman is also of the opinion that selling insurance across state lines wouldn\u2019t change how much insurance costs. \u201cThe rest of it is just rhetoric,\u201d he adds. \u201cIt\u2019s designed to appeal to his base.\u201d\n\nIf Trump is really serious about making HSAs work effectively for patients, Vliet says he would \u201celiminate the ObamaCare restrictions on HSAs.\u201d Vliet says Trump should also expand the options of how funds can be used for healthcare-related purchases.\n\n\u201cAAPS is not endorsing any particular presidential candidate,\u201d says Vliet. \u201cI\u2019m a past member of the board of directors and we are doing an analysis of the proposals of the different candidates to say what fits with things that we feel would best help patients and improve the delivery of health services as well as lower the cost.\u201d\n\nVN:F [1.9.6_1107]\n\n, 9.5 out of 10 based on 2 ratings", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.gopusa.com/pros-cons-on-trumps-healthcare-proposal/", "site_name": "GOPUSA", "image": "http://www.gopusa.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/trump_nh_win.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Pros, cons on Trump's healthcare proposal"}, "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Donald Trump\u2019s healthcare plan continues to have people talking, while others want more details.\nDr. Elizabeth Lee Vliet, past director for the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons (AAPS), says Trump\u2019s proposed healthcare plan contains several very good points, beginning with a repeal of ObamaCare.\nThat allows lower premiums for the health insurance.\u201dVliet adds that HSAs would give patients the flexibility and freedom to spend their healthcare dollars in their HSAs.\n\u201cIt\u2019s cobbled together a few, conservative ideas like HSAs and selling insurance across state lines with some arguably liberal ideas,\u201d says Feyman.\nYevgeniy Feyman, fellow for and deputy director with the Manhattan Institute\u2019s Center for Medical Progress, calls it a non-plan."}
