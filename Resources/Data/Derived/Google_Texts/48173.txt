According to authorities, a man who used an assault rifle to rob a bank in Nebraska earlier this month is suspected to be a prolific bank robber who has been involved in many heists across the western US.

Dubbed as AK-47 Bandit, the man is the prime suspect behind the August 22 robbery of the First National Bank branch in southeast Nebraska. He is also suspected of shooting a Chino police officer during a heist in February 2012.

The bandit is linked to bank robberies in Northern California, Idaho and Washington. He is dubbed as the AK-47 Bandit because he loves to carry the assault rifle into his targeted banks.

A $100,000 reward has been announced by the FBI for providing rips leading to his arrest. He cheated the victims by telling them that he used to be an officer and can be seen wearing tactical gear, a full-face ski mask and blue ballistic vest or green mesh vest marked Sheriff in the footage captured by surveillance video.

Police was very close to catch him in Chino, but luck favored him and he got away after shooting the officer. Chino police detectives have gathered in Nebraska to help in the investigation.

"We want to make everyone aware of how violent this man is. He is not afraid to pull the trigger, he has already shot a police officer. So anyone that gives him any resistance, he's not afraid to act", said Chino Police Det. Carlos Dominguez.

The man is believed to be behind a robbery at a Vacaville Bank of the West on March 12, 2012, before which he robbed the California Bank & Trust in Chino.

As per the description given by the authorities, he is a white male, 25 to 40 years old, about 5 feet 10 inches tall and weighs between 180 and 200 pounds.
