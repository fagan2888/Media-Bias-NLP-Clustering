It\u2019s $3 billion more than Facebook raised when it was first listed, and more than twice what Microsoft paid for Skype.\n\n(To be precise, $12 billion of the $19 billion will be in the form of shares in Facebook, $4 billion will be in cash, and $3 billion in restricted stock to WhatsApp staff, which will vest in four years.)\n\nGiven that gargantuan amount, you might think Whatsapp is a big company. You\u2019d be wrong. It has 55 employees, including its two young founders, Jan Koum and Brian Acton.\n\nWhatsapp\u2019s value doesn\u2019t come from making anything. It doesn\u2019t need a large organization to distribute its services or implement its strategy.\n\nIt value comes instead from two other things that require only a handful of people. First is its technology \u2014 a simple but powerful app that allows users to send and receive text, image, audio and video messages through the Internet.\n\nThe second is its network effect: The more people use it, the more other people want and need to use it in order to be connected. To that extent, it\u2019s like Facebook \u2014 driven by connectivity.\n\nWhatsApp\u2019s worldwide usage has more than doubled in the past nine months, to 450 million people \u2014 and it\u2019s growing by around a million users every day. On December 31, 2013, it handled 54 billion messages (making its service more popular than Twitter, now valued at about $30 billion.)\n\nHow does it make money? The first year of usage is free. After that, customers pay a small fee. At the scale it\u2019s already achieved, even a small fee generates big bucks. And if it gets into advertising it could reach more eyeballs than any other medium in history. It already has a database that could be mined in ways that reveal huge amounts of information about a significant percentage of the world\u2019s population.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The instant messaging service connects millions, but its record-breaking sale won't generate new jobs", "title": "Robert Reich: WhatsApp is everything wrong with the U.S. economy", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The instant messaging service connects millions, but its record-breaking sale won't generate new jobs", "title": "Robert Reich: WhatsApp is everything wrong with the U.S. economy", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/02/22/the_billion_dollar_whatsapp_acquisition_is_whats_wrong_with_americas_growth_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/robert_reich.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The instant messaging service connects millions, but its record-breaking sale won't generate new jobs", "title": "Robert Reich: WhatsApp is everything wrong with the U.S. economy", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/robert_reich.jpg", "creator": "@rbreich", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Robert Reich", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Facebook, Jobs, RobertReich.org, technology, U.S. Economy, WhatsApp", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8500\"", "article_summary": "Topics: Facebook, Jobs, RobertReich.org, technology, U.S. Economy, WhatsApp, Technology News, Business News, Politics NewsThis originally appeared on Robert Reich's blogIf you ever wonder what\u2019s fueling America\u2019s staggering inequality, ponder Facebook\u2019s acquisition of the mobile messaging company WhatsApp.\nAccording to news reports today, Facebook has agreed to buy WhatsApp for $19 billion.\nIt\u2019s $3 billion more than Facebook raised when it was first listed, and more than twice what Microsoft paid for Skype.\nGiven that gargantuan amount, you might think Whatsapp is a big company.\nOn December 31, 2013, it handled 54 billion messages (making its service more popular than Twitter, now valued at about $30 billion.)"}
