Peyton Manning on Monday finally said what has been obvious since his Super Bowl win a month ago: He is calling it a career. Manning is one of the most famous athletes on the planet. Even if you are not a football fan you have probably seen him in a commercial for brands such as Direct TV, Papa Johns, Gatorade, Sprint and Nationwide insurance (“chicken parm, you taste so good”).

His age — a brittle 39 — showed this past season, but Manning was able to return from injury, win back his starting job and game-manage the Denver Broncos, powered by a fearsome defense, to a Super Bowl win.
