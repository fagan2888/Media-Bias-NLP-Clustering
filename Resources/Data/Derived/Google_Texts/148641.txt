In today’s edition of The Heartland Daily Podcast, Heartland Editor Justin Haskins discusses presidential candidate Jeb Bush’s plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare.

As Haskins explains, there are good and bad aspects to this proposed plan. On the plus side, the plan seeks to put an end to the numerous mandates included in the controversial healthcare system. The individual mandate, and the employer and employee mandates will be brought to an end. Included in Bush’s plan are several other policy ideas that would shift insurance markets to more of a free-market system.

Haskins not only looks at the good parts of the plan, he also examines the drawbacks. Bush’s plan would hold in place the guarantee for people with pre-existing to be able to purchase health insurance. This well-intentioned part of Obamacare leads to many opportunities to abuse the system. Haskins examines several other negatives that he sees in the plan.

Editor’s Note: In the podcast, Bush’s plan to cap tax breaks is talked about at length. Just to clarify and correct, Bush’s plan is to cap the tax break individuals, not businesses, receive for their employer-provided health insurance. Here’s the official quote from Bush’s campaign website: “Give individuals a $12,000 tax break on the health benefits they receive through their employer — a reform that will encourage lower insurance premiums and higher wages.”
