What has kept you here? My family moved from western Kansas to Longmont in 1975, when my father was hired as a math teacher and basketball coach at Niwot High School. My wife, Tara, and I decided to raise our family here because we love it.\n\nWhat's the best part of being the principal at Lyons Middle/Senior? I love being the principal at Lyons Middle/Senior High because of our focus on excellence in academics, athletics and the fine arts. My unofficial motto is \"Lyons Middle/Senior is a small school with big results.\"\n\nBest change at Lyons Middle/Senior since the flood? We realized the need to expand our concurrent enrollment options in the high school. When students missed seven days of school, it caused us to think about offering online courses. We now have a partnership with Colorado State University to offer online college courses for our students.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.timescall.com/community-review/ci_27741774/100-greg-winger", "modificationDate": "2015-03-24T23:02:40-0600", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2015/0318/20150318__29TC100_WINGER~1_300.jpg", "endDate": "2025-03-18T23:26:41-0600", "description": "Age: 50\nOccupation: Principal, Lyons Middle/Senior High School\nYears in the St. Vrain Valley: 39\nWhat brought you here?", "ag": {"canon": "LongmontTimes-Call:article:27741774:view"}, "startDate": "2015-03-29T01:00:00-0600", "og": {"url": "http://www.timescall.com/community-review/ci_27741774/100-greg-winger", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2015/0318/20150318__29TC100_WINGER~1.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Age: 50\nOccupation: Principal, Lyons Middle/Senior High School\nYears in the St. Vrain Valley: 39\nWhat brought you here?", "title": "100: Greg Winger"}, "twitter": {"domain": "timescall.com", "description": "Age: 50\nOccupation: Principal, Lyons Middle/Senior High School\nYears in the St. Vrain Valley: 39\nWhat brought you here?", "title": "100: Greg Winger", "url": "http://www.timescall.com/community-review/ci_27741774/100-greg-winger", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2015/0318/20150318__29TC100_WINGER~1.jpg", "site": "@TimesCall", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-03-29T01:00:00-0600", "sailthru.site": "timescall.com", "sailthru.title": "100: Greg Winger", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Community Review", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "google-site-verification": "lLtD9ZooxmJUEEdRSCVzkO06t_hYKtyDqZF7EA3N2U0", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2015/0318/20150318__29TC100_WINGER~1.jpg", "pubDate": "2015-03-24T23:03:15-0600", "news_keywords": "longmont, colorado, community, review, weld, county, top 100, community review, longmont times call, longmont colorado"}, "article_summary": "Greg WingerAge: 50Occupation: Principal, Lyons Middle/Senior High SchoolYears in the St. Vrain Valley: 39What brought you here?\nMy family moved from western Kansas to Longmont in 1975, when my father was hired as a math teacher and basketball coach at Niwot High School.\nI love being the principal at Lyons Middle/Senior High because of our focus on excellence in academics, athletics and the fine arts.\nWe realized the need to expand our concurrent enrollment options in the high school.\nBest change at Lyons Middle/Senior since the flood?"}
