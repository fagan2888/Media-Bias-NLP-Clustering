Let me repeat that \u2013 it\u2019s a measure to fight slavery, a concept most of us living in this country in this century oppose. You can probably figure out by now what the controversial sticking point is. Yup, this is about abortion. In an upheaval that demonstrates yet again why you should always read the fine print, Senate Democrats Justice for Victims of Human Trafficking Act went into overdrive Tuesday over a recently-added Hyde Amendment-inspired provision that would restrict federal funding for abortion, as well as other health care services.\n\nThe original bill, introduced by Texas Republican Senator John Cornyn, strengthens law enforcement resources for human trafficking cases and establishes a fund for victims, to be paid out from fines and penalties reaped from perpetrators. Speaking just Tuesday morning, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said, \u201cThis legislation is vital. So I hope now that it has been brought to the floor, that this bill continues to enjoy its strong record of constructive bipartisan support. These victims need a voice. They need justice. And the new Congress is determined to give them both. \u2026 I look forward to the Senate\u2019s good work to pass it.\u201d\n\nBut then, as Democrats began to the provision in a bill they just the day before had agreed to begin debate on it, things got intense. Sen. Patty Murray observed, \u201cThe Republicans are trying to pull a fast one here on human trafficking bill, but it is absolutely wrong and honestly it is shameful.\u201d And Sen. Chuck Schumer asserted, \u201cA list was sent to certain members saying, \u2018here are the changes from last year.\u2019 This provision was not listed among them.\u201d But Sen. Cornyn noted that the revised version has been available since January, saying, \u201cThis idea that there has been some sort of ambush is just preposterous. That we surprised them by including this restriction on taxpayer-funded abortion that\u2019s been the law of the land for 39 years is patently ridiculous.\u201d As Steve Benen explained on MSNBC, \u201cAs this year\u2019s process got underway, GOP senators provided Dems with a list of minor alterations to the bill\u2019s language. The anti-abortion measure wasn\u2019t on the list, and Democrats moved forward, taking Republicans at their word.\u201d Lesson learned, right?", "article_metadata": {"description": "The bipartisan bill is now a battleground over restrictions on how federal funds can be allocated", "title": "Republicans pushing anti-abortion language could derail bipartisan human trafficking bill", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The bipartisan bill is now a battleground over restrictions on how federal funds can be allocated", "title": "Republicans pushing anti-abortion language could derail bipartisan human trafficking bill", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/03/11/the_fight_against_human_trafficking_derails_over_abortion/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/mitch_mcconnell10.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The bipartisan bill is now a battleground over restrictions on how federal funds can be allocated", "title": "Republicans pushing anti-abortion language could derail bipartisan human trafficking bill", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/mitch_mcconnell10.jpg", "creator": "@embeedub", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Mary Elizabeth Williams", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Abortion, Human Trafficking, Justice for Victims of Human Trafficking Act, Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: Abortion, Human Trafficking, Justice for Victims of Human Trafficking Act, Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., Life NewsBecause conservatives are so fearful of aligning themselves with anything that might actually be mistaken as merciful \u2014 lest they alienate their constituents \u2014 a bipartisan bill aimed at combating human trafficking found itself suddenly derailed earlier this week.\nThe anti-abortion measure wasn\u2019t on the list, and Democrats moved forward, taking Republicans at their word.\u201d Lesson learned, right?\nThe original bill, introduced by Texas Republican Senator John Cornyn, strengthens law enforcement resources for human trafficking cases and establishes a fund for victims, to be paid out from fines and penalties reaped from perpetrators.\nSo I hope now that it has been brought to the floor, that this bill continues to enjoy its strong record of constructive bipartisan support.\nLet me repeat that \u2013 it\u2019s a measure to fight slavery, a concept most of us living in this country in this century oppose."}
