Denver police have arrested a man sought in the early Saturday abduction of his former girlfriend after he allegedly rammed her car with his van in Jefferson County.

The woman was eventually found safe nearby.

David Sikora, 28, was arrested about 9:45 a.m. Saturday at a house in the 300 block of South Alcott Street in southwest Denver in connection with allegedly kidnapping his ex-girlfriend, Megan Vandellen, 26.

Vandellen was found a few hours later in the same neighborhood in which Sikora was arrested, the Jefferson County Sheriff’s Office reported.

Sikora was booked late Saturday on charges of kidnapping and assault and held without bond.

“(Sikora) was outside a house that the van was registered to,” said Mark Techmeyer, spokesman for the Jefferson County Sheriff’s Office.

The investigation began when a man who was a passenger in Vandellen’s car called 911 at about 5 a.m. Saturday describing the incident.

“We fully believe we have a domestic violence-related abduction,” Techmeyer said.

The witness told authorities that he was riding as a passenger in Vandellen’s car on Colorado 93 when a white, cargo-type van began chasing them.

The car came to a stop after the suspect, described by the witness as the victim’s ex-boyfriend, rammed the car with his van.

After the collision, the passenger jumped out of the car and ran away.

“The man was scared and took off running,” Techmeyer said. The name of the witness has not been released.

When he returned to the car later, Vandellen and the van were gone, Techmeyer said.

The abduction happened on Colorado 93 near Matthew Winters Park.

The witness said he does not know Vandellen well.

“What we’re trying to do is figure out why he was with the woman on Highway 93 at 5 a.m.,” Techmeyer said.

The witness was interviewed at Jefferson County Sheriff’s Department headquarters in Golden.
