Pop singer Lorde has become an unwitting part of the buildup for this year’s World Series, with radio stations in San Francisco and Kansas City jousting over her hit “Royals.”

According to Rolling Stone, two San Francisco stations KOIT-FM and KFOG announced, they will stop playing the song, since the 17-year-old New Zealand native has admitted to being inspired to write the song by Kansas City Royals great George Brett.

“I had this image of this dude just signing baseballs,” she explained. “His shirt said ‘Royals,’ it was just that word.”

Deadspin reported that the picture in question was a 1976 National Geographic photo of Brett signing autographs. The chance connection led to Brett meeting Lorde, and the team adopting her song as a sort of unofficial theme.

In response, KOIT’s sister station in Kansas City said it would play “Royals” at the top of the hour every hour.

“I respect the work of Mr. Brian Figula, 96.5 KOIT program director, and his team of broadcast professionals, but we won’t let their anti-Royals spirit ruin this moment,” KZPT general manager Tony Lorino said in a statement. “A few angry San Franciscans who don’t have a song called ‘Giants’ won’t rain on our parade.”

The series begins on Tuesday. No bet has been announced between San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee and Kansas City Mayor Sylvester “Sly” James, but two Democratic lawmakers, Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and Rep. Emanuel Cleaver (D-MO) did place a wager; McClatchy reported that Pelosi has put “a basket of San Francisco’s finest chocolates” up against a “President’s Tray” barbeque order from Gates Bar B.Q.
