The GPTCA\u2019s letter is available here. The tribes\u2019 actions are in solidarity with San Carlos Apache Chairman Terry Rambler, who has launched a grassroots campaign to defeat the land swap measure.\n\nRELATED: San Carlos Apache Leader Seeks Senate Defeat of Copper Mine on Sacred Land\n\nRELATED: Re: Raiding Native Sacred Places in a Defense Authorization: Everything Wrong with Congress\n\n\u201cIf such a land transfer provision seems out of place in a defense bill, that\u2019s because it is. If the idea of transferring the ownership of federal forest lands to foreign mining companies seems absurd, it\u2019s because that\u2019s true, too,\u201d said Fawn Sharp, President of the Quinault Indian Nation and ATNI and Area Vice President of the National Congress of American Indians.\n\nThe Southeast Arizona Land Exchange and Conservation Act is a House bill sponsored by Rep. Paul Gosar (R-AZ). It was tacked on to the annual must-pass NDAA along with several other land-related bills by Sen, John McCain (R-AZ), according to the Huffington Post. The House approved the land swap bill December 4 and sent it on to the Senate for a vote. If approved by the Senate and signed by President Obama, the land swap provision will allow Resolution Copper Co., a subsidiary of the controversial international mining conglomerate Rio Tinto, to acquire 2,400 acres of the federally protected public land in the Tonto National Forest in southeast Arizona in exchange for 5,000 acres in parcels scattered around the state. The United Kingdom-based privately-owned global mining corporation reported earnings of $10.2 billion in 2013, a 10 percent increase over the previous year.\n\nResolution Copper plans a massive deep underground copper mine on the San Carlos Apache\u2019s sacred landscape and has already begun drilling the shaft in anticipation of the land swap bill\u2019s approval.\n\nRELATED: San Carlos Apache Would Get Biggest Shaft Ever in Copper Mine Land Swap\n\nLetters were sent to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and the chairs and vice chairs of the Senate Armed Forces and Indian Affairs committees December 9, asking that the Southeast Arizona Land Exchange and Conservation Act be stricken from the NDAA, ATNI contact Steve Robinson said in a media release.\n\nSharp noted that the land swap is strongly opposed by tribes, tribal organizations, and other governments and groups from across the country, \u201cand for very good reasons,\u201d she said. \u201cThis action, of transferring land out of federal ownership removes it from the Federal Trust Responsibility, which, along with treaty rights, is a primary way the tribes have left to protect our traditional lands from being destroyed.\u201d\n\nReferring to Indian country\u2019s decade-long effort to keep the Apache\u2019s sacred landscape out of the hands of the mining company, Sharp said, \u201cWe have had to fight this effort before, and we will keep on fighting it.\u201d\n\nThe ATNI passed a resolution opposing the land transfer bill in 2011. There were several efforts to move it last year, but a large bipartisan group of members of the House twice pulled the land swap legislation consideration. \u201cThe Land Exchange cannot pass Congress on its own merits,\u201d Sharp said. \u201cAttaching this provision as a rider to NDAA represents the antithesis of democracy.\u201d\n\nSharp said that the proposed giveaway of tribal sacred areas to foreign corporations \u201cconstitutes a violation of trust and a slap in the face of our veterans, past and present. These are sacred lands. All land is sacred to us, but this exchange includes a place of worship known as Oak Flat, which has particularly significant religious, cultural, historical, and archeological value to tribes in the region. The land is eligible for protection under the National Historic Preservation Act.\u201d\n\nBut once the land is privatized it is no longer protected by federal laws such as the National Historic Preservation Act, the Archaeological Resources Protection Act, the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act, the American Indian Religious Freedom Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, and Executive Order 13007\u2014 Protection of Indian Sacred Sites.\n\nThe land swap act also sets a bad precedent, Sharp points out, because it does not allow for any meaningful consultation with tribes and mandates the land transfer within one year of its passage without any studies or environmental impact assessments.\n\n\u201cAs if that\u2019s not enough, Resolution Copper would develop a copper mine that will forever destroy the tribes\u2019 religious practices by irrevocably harming the region\u2019s water supply and quality,\u201d Sharp said. \u201cAt what point do human rights and justice stop taking a backseat to profiteering in this country?\u201d\n\nThe ATNI was formed in 1953 and is the largest regional Indian organization in the country dedicated to tribal sovereignty and self-determination. ATNI represents tribal governments from Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Northern California, Southeast Alaska, and Western Montana.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Affiliated Tribes of Northwest Indians have joined in asking senators not to enact Section 3003 of the National Defense Authorization Act.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "kpolisse", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/12/12/57-affiliated-tribes-northwest-indians-urge-senate-nix-sacred-land-giveaway-158266", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/affiliated_tribes_of_northwest_indians_seal.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "57 Affiliated Tribes of Northwest Indians Urge Senate to Nix Sacred Land Giveaway"}, "abstract": "The Affiliated Tribes of Northwest Indians have joined in asking senators not to enact Section 3003 of the National Defense Authorization Act.", "dc": {"title": "57 Affiliated Tribes of Northwest Indians Urge Senate to Nix Sacred Land Giveaway"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/12/12/57-affiliated-tribes-northwest-indians-urge-senate-nix-sacred-land-giveaway-158266", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "National Historic Preservation Act, Archaeological Resources Protection Act, Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act, American Indian Religious Freedom Act, National Environmental Policy Act, Fawn Sharp, Sen.
