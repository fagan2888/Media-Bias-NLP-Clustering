Until the end of the year, you have time to take steps to significantly cut your tax bill.\n\nStart by pulling out last year\u2019s return and evaluating what will be different when you file for this year. If you made more money, perhaps you want to contribute more to a 401(k), donate to charity or buy tax-deductible business equipment by the end of the year.\n\nIf you own a small business, had a major life event or face different financial circumstances than you did a year ago, fall is a good time to seek professional advice. You may be able to take steps to improve your tax situation before the end of the year.\n\n\u201cI highly, highly, highly recommend meeting with your tax preparer every quarter if you can afford it,\u201d says Kelly Phillips Erb, a columnist and tax attorney in Pennsylvania. \u201cIt\u2019s better to have that conversation now rather than in April when you can\u2019t do anything about it.\u201d\n\n[See: 14 Legal Secrets for Reducing Your Taxes.]\n\nIf you don\u2019t have an accountant or would like to make a change, this is the best time to find one. After filing the last individual tax returns, which are due Oct. 15, accountants and other tax preparers head into a less busy season. That means they have time to talk to potential clients or offer analysis and advice to existing clients.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re thinking about changing tax professionals, now is the time,\u201d says Meisa Bonelli, managing partner of Millennial Tax, which provides services to home-based business owners and entrepreneurs in New York City. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to be looking for a tax professional in January or February.\u201d\n\nMany small business owners wait too long to find the right accountant. \u201cWe always suggest to our clients when you start earning about $75,000 a year, start looking for a professional that specializes in your industry,\u201d Bonelli says.\n\nHere are 12 tax issues to tackle before the end of the year.\n\nCatch up on quarterly tax payments. People who are self-employed or receive income that is not subject to withholding are supposed to make estimated tax payments. If you pay too little, you could be slapped with a penalty. The sooner you send the money, the smaller the penalty.\n\nDecide who takes the children or other household members as dependents. If you share custody of children with an ex-spouse or partner, or you share responsibility for supporting another relative, only one of you can deduct that person as a dependent. This is also the case for children and the Earned Income Tax Credit. Do some math and figure out what makes sense for your situation.\n\n[Read: How to Survive an IRS Audit.]\n\nIf you don\u2019t have insurance, apply for an exemption. Those who did not purchase health insurance this year face a tax penalty, unless they meet some of several exemptions, says Lisa Greene-Lewis, a certified public accountant and TurboTax tax expert. To complete your tax return, you\u2019ll need an exemption number, which you can get from the Health Insurance Marketplace, she says.\n\nCheck your Affordable Care Act subsidy status. If you underestimated your income and received too much subsidy, you may have to pay it back. If your income was less than you estimated, you may get a subsidy via your tax return. If your circumstances have changed, you can make changes now at the Health Insurance Marketplace.\n\n\n\nUse the extra money in your flexible spending account. In most companies, you can carry up to $500 into 2015, but you don\u2019t want to leave any additional money in your account. Make sure you understand the rules of your company\u2019s plan. \u201cEvaluate your expenses this year and look ahead to what you expect to spend in 2015 and see whether to adjust your withholding,\u201d Greene-Lewis advises.\n\nConsider whether to accelerate or reduce income. For some taxpayers, it may make sense to prepay your mortgage and real estate taxes and incur business expenses in 2014. For others, paying those expenses in 2015 may be more advantageous. The only way to make those decisions is to calculate where you are financially this year and where you expect to be next year. \u201cThere\u2019s no cookie cutter for who should accelerate and who shouldn\u2019t,\u201d Bonelli says.", "article_metadata": {"usn-stitial-fact": "{\"slug\":\"150129_Millennials\",\"text\":\"More than 60 percent of millennials don\u2019t have a credit card.\"}", "usn-comments-mode": "facebook", "description": "Getting your taxes in shape before the year's end will save time and money when you file your return.", "zone": "personal-finance/home/articles", "author": "Teresa Mears", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Getting your taxes in shape before the year's end will save time and money when you file your return.", "title": "12 Smart Tax Moves to Make This Fall", "url": "http://money.usnews.com/money/personal-finance/articles/2014/10/03/12-smart-tax-moves-to-make-this-fall", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/43/d3/314557404d6cb98fc39d76bd56f8/141003-taxprep-stock.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Getting your taxes in shape before the year's end will save time and money when you file your return.", "site": "@USNews", "card": "summary", "title": "12 Smart Tax Moves to Make This Fall - US News"}, "usn-platform-id": "a", "site": "money-news", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "published_at": "2014-10-03", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/ab453ab/2147483647/crop/800x800%2B0%2B0/resize/80x80/quality/85/?url=%2Fcmsmedia%2F43%2Fd3%2F314557404d6cb98fc39d76bd56f8%2F141003-taxprep-stock.jpg", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "keywords": "taxes,tax exemptions,tax deductions,income tax,tax returns,money,personal finance,PerfiBucket-Taxes [Consumer Advice],Teresa Mears", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/usnewsandworldreport", "published_time": "2014-10-03"}, "usn-content-type": "article", "social_id": "http://t.usnews.com/Z3gvwx", "viewport": "width=980", "news_keywords": "taxes, tax return, money, personal finance, tax advisor, 401(k), charity, income tax, IRS, tax deductions"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb92b\"", "article_summary": "This is also the case for children and the Earned Income Tax Credit.\nTo complete your tax return, you\u2019ll need an exemption number, which you can get from the Health Insurance Marketplace, she says.\nIf your income was less than you estimated, you may get a subsidy via your tax return.\nAfter filing the last individual tax returns, which are due Oct. 15, accountants and other tax preparers head into a less busy season.\nYou may be able to take steps to improve your tax situation before the end of the year."}
