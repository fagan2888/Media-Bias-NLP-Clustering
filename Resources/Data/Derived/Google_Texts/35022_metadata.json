At the local level in states like Hawaii, Republican campaign staff and party volunteers have made post-defeat debriefings a regular tradition, where demoralized conservatives dial in to a conference call to hear a litany of excuses why the latest \u201cRepublican wave\u201d failed to materialize or how, goshdarnit, the Democrats just won again in spite of every effort.\n\nThe rise of the \u201ctea party\u201d \u2013 that is, renascent conservatism \u2013 is therefore attributable less to the onslaught of Democrats and more to the arrogance of the GOP leadership. Distressed by the party\u2019s systemic patterns of slighting fiscal or social conservatives in favor of out-of-touch, left-leaning Republicans (you know them as \u201cRINOs\u201d), persons who traditionally identified with the Republican brand took to their state capitols and town halls all across the country and organized a ronin-like counteroffensive to take back America\u2019s honor. In 2010, the tea party shook the foundations of city councils, state legislatures, and the Congress and proved itself to be a force to be reckoned with.\n\nThough tea party candidates since the 2010 election have suffered some key defeats and made a few blunders in office, their movement has nonetheless succeeded in keeping viable traditional American values in spite of the compromises of the GOP and the activism of the Democrats. Americans have seen the disastrous effects of both major parties colluding against them, and all across the country we are witnessing an increased distrust for the political establishment.\n\nBoth the Democratic and Republican parties are fighting internal civil wars for the souls of their organizations. The rising surge of Bernie Sanders against Hillary Clinton and the massive fracturing of the GOP for anyone other than Jeb Bush is proof that America is restless and on the brink of a watershed change. But of all the groups poised to act on this moment of decision, no movement is better prepared to win than the tea party.\n\nAmerica is burned out with President Obama and won\u2019t elect Hillary Clinton no matter how much the mainstream media\u2019s focus groups or polls say she will. Mrs. Clinton offers nothing new to liberal voters other than the allure of being the first woman to win the presidency, a novelty that still does not pay off the $1.2 trillion in student debt or erases the inflationary hardships inflicted by President Obama\u2019s monetary policy.\n\nThe Law of Diminishing Returns also applies to the partnership between the Democrats and LBGTs, who, thanks to President Obama\u2019s zeal, already possess everything they want in the form of gay marriage and a repeal of don\u2019t ask/don\u2019t tell in the military.\n\nShort of electing an openly gay president, LBGTs have nothing else to gain by voting for more Democrats or electing Mrs. Clinton, whose own husband in signing the Defense of Marriage Act remarked, \u201cI have long opposed governmental recognition of same-gender marriages and this legislation is consistent with that position. The Act confirms the right of each state to determine its own policy with respect to same gender marriage and clarifies for the purposes of federal law the operative meaning of the terms \u2018marriage\u2019 and \u2018spouse.'\u201d\n\nAnti-war protesters won\u2019t vote Democratic, either. The country has seen all too well what a Nobel Peace Prize-winner like President Obama actually does in the White House, and anti-war protesters are suffering the worst case of cognitive dissonance since the Vietnam War.\n\nIn short, the Democrats have already played their cards and expended their options. All that remains for the American public now are paying the bills and staying out of the crosshairs of China/Russia/ISIS/Iran, and deep down the voters know those are two areas where the traditional establishment Ds and Rs can\u2019t be trusted to make the right call.\n\nThe upcoming primaries will annihilate the establishment picks of both parties as zealous insurgents on the left and the right will flood the caucuses and distort the election into a contest of extremity. The end result will be that the Democratic primaries will choose the candidate that offers the most (scarce) crumbs from President Obama\u2019s table and Republicans will pick the candidate that promises to flip over Obama\u2019s table.\n\nThe tea party can only stand to win from this engagement, because the Democrats will no longer have the unified coalitions they need to achieve a win set. You can be sure that most of Obama\u2019s 2008 voters will stay home in 2016, either out of disgust for who the Democratic nominee is or from contentment of having already received their \u201chistoric\u201d gains.\n\nThe tea party, whose coalition spans low-income blue collar workers, rural voters, stay-at-home moms, hyperidealistic honor-bound military academy cadets, military veterans, career civil service and small business owners (many of whom suffered immensely as a result of the Bush/Obama bailouts) is more diverse and yet more united than anything the Democrats have and more honorable than any of the so-called \u201cupper crust\u201d Republican leadership.\n\nThese tea party voters may not make large financial contributions to candidates or the GOP, but they are infectious because among their immediate spheres of influence they are seen by family members, friends, neighbors and coworkers to be authority figures and go-tos for information. They may cause an occasional argument at a weekend BBQ or a family reunion when the topic of Obamacare or some major national issue is incidentally discussed, but they are also the people who get the text messages from friends on Election Day that read \u201cTell me who I\u2019m supposed to vote for!\u201d\n\nForget about what you\u2019ve heard on major network news or biased blogs. The tea party is more ready than ever before. They may be pressed on every side, but they are not crushed; they may be persecuted, but they are not abandoned; they may have been struck down again and again, but they have not been destroyed. While the Democrats and Republicans were too busy trying to change the laws, the tea party was changing their families and their communities.\n\nThroughout the late 20th century and early 21st century, the conservative movement has fought to preserve America as a place of freedom and honor. The decline of our country, however, has changed the mission of true patriots from conservation to restoration. In my political novel \u201cAmerican Kiss,\u201d a future presidential candidate calls his movement\u2019s followers \u201crestoratives\u201d rather than conservatives or libertarians because he seeks to restore the unfulfilled promise of the American Dream to Generation X and Millennials. Today\u2019s tea party stands in such a position to restore the greatness of the America, and both parties\u2019 elites know and fear this.\n\nThe tea party has never forgotten Ronald Reagan\u2019s words: \u201cYour generation stands on the verge of greater advances than humankind has ever known. America\u2019s future will be determined by your dreams and your visions.\u201d\n\n2016 will be the year freedom advances farther than ever before. Who will win the upcoming election? America will. Wait and see.\n\nDr. Danny de Gracia is a political scientist, an ordained minister, a former elected official and the author of the new political thriller \u201cAmerican Kiss,\u201d available now from Amazon.com, Barnes and Noble, and other major bookstores.
