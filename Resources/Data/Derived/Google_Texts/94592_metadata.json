Detractors, dubbing the proposals \u201cbathroom bills,\u201d are outraged that businesses may be required to allow transgender people to use the facilities of their affirmed gender.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo me this bill is a litmus test of whether my fellow Bay Staters are ready to accept my son, without fear or prejudice, for who he is.\n\nJacob is transgender. From the age of 2 he persistently fought his assignment as female. His gender dysphoria manifested in poor body image, low self-esteem, and social withdrawal. After a two-year journey \u2014 with a pit stop in each of the five stages of grief \u2014 we finally affirmed Jacob\u2019s decision to live as a boy last year. This year, we have discovered how dangerous it may be to be a boy like Jacob.\n\n\u201cMay,\u201d because Jacob has yet to encounter overt discrimination. Our wonderful community and its leaders have gone out of their way to welcome us. Ergo, to Jacob, discrimination is when he gets a smaller slice of pie then his sister.\n\nThat is because Jacob is five.\n\nHowever, one day he will grow up, and seek new horizons and independent experiences. He will leave our home. I cannot hold his hand. My heart will be in his.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe statistics are grim for transgender individuals in the US.\n\nA 2011 study concluded that 63 percent experienced at least one traumatic incident of discrimination based on their gender presentation. Over half the incidents took place in public spaces. This abuse creates the context for the study\u2019s most somber finding: 41 percent of respondents reported at least one suicide attempt. How many never lived to fill out forms?\n\nThis is the primary reason that none of us \u2014 parents of transgender kids \u2014 wanted to be where we are today: fighting for our children\u2019s lives.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing trendy about your child having a one in two chance of surviving through adulthood.\n\nOne mom relays that her 12-year-old was forced to use a separate bathroom from his campmates \u2014 nearly a mile away. The mother stood vigil all day outside the gates for fear of letting him walk alone. Another tells of her son\u2019s harrowing experience with TSA at Logan, where he was frisked and publicly humiliated during a routine check. Is it any wonder in this environment of persistent bigotry that the emotional health of transgender people is severely compromised?\n\nToday Jacob is a kindergartner. With large brown eyes, a round face, and a lisp, I can\u2019t imagine anyone kicking him out of a restaurant, any more than I can imagine someone kicking a puppy in the street. And yet, I can\u2019t ignore the sobering reality of his brethren and sisters, nor the rising body count of those murdered for an existence offensive to those who cannot comprehend it.\n\nMy child is the center of my universe. I can\u2019t understand what others fear and hate in him.\n\nI am baffled by the moral outrage evinced at the idea of giving him the right to a measure of decency.\n\nAndrew Beckwith, president of the Massachusetts Family Institute, testified against the legislation, evoking the right to privacy and safety of women and girls across the state. Passing the bill, he railed, would enable a predator to \u201cexpose his very male genitalia\u201d to Beckwith\u2019s 5-year-old daughter.\n\nBeckwith\u2019s comments are so deeply hurtful not only because they are completely unfounded (no crimes of this nature have been reported in the 17 states that passed such statutes), but because they harken back to one of the ugliest eras in our past when the sanctity of wives and daughters was used as the mob\u2019s excuse to lynch innocents.\n\nI, too, have daughters: one older and one younger than Jacob. I can empathize with a parent\u2019s fear for their child\u2019s safety but I cannot condone baseless fearmongering.\n\nLives will depend on our ability to separate reality from fantasy. The \u201ctransgender-person-as-frustrated-sexual-predator\u201d myth is an insidious meme that has no place in a society that values human rights. While there is no evidence that a transgender person is more likely to engage in criminality, there is evidence that a transgender person has more to fear in a public bathroom than I do. What is true is that without laws protecting him, my son may find himself kicked off a bus on a highway, or refused treatment in a hospital, with impunity. Attorney General Maura Healey said it best: \u201cDiscomfort is not a reason to perpetuate discrimination.\u201d\n\nLaws frequently follow changes in society, but they can also precede them, signaling what behaviors are and are not acceptable. As a state, we risk losing the moral leadership we gained by being the first to legalize same-sex marriage. We stand to be 18th in recognizing transgender rights. It\u2019s time to catch up. If we don\u2019t, it may be too late for my son.", "article_metadata": {"eomportal-loid": "4.1.829077394", "eomportal-id": 501507, "description": "The bill is a litmus test of whether my fellow Bay Staters are ready to accept my son, without fear or prejudice, for who he is.", "eomportal-instanceid": 29, "og": {"city": "Boston", "site_name": "BostonGlobe.com", "description": "The bill is a litmus test of whether my fellow Bay Staters are ready to accept my son, without fear or prejudice, for who he is.", "title": "The truth about the transgender public accommodations bill - The Boston Globe", "url": "https://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/2015/10/20/the-truth-about-transgender-public-accommodations-bill/tl8OiTH5VlN9lFFyfeA2XI/story.html", "country": "US", "image": "http://c.o0bg.com/rf/image_585w/Boston/2011-2020/2015/09/10/BostonGlobe.com/BCOM/Images/davis_trans3_met.jpg", "longitude": "-71.0597732", "state": "MA", "latitude": "42.3584308", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"account_id": 95431448, "card": "summary", "site": "BostonGlobe"}, "robots": "noarchive", "eomportal-lastUpdate": "Thu May 26 00:07:42 EDT 2016", "fb": {"admins": 507486035, "app_id": 103933749691726, "pages": 5637143257}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/globe"}, "flashsale": "false", "viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "eomportal-uuid": "234682dc-77e2-11e5-9894-3a5e13bcf08f"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0e8c\"", "article_summary": "Lawmakers, lobbyists, transgender individuals, and their parents gathered on Oct. 6 at the State House before the joint Judiciary Committee to testify about a bill guaranteeing equal access in public spaces to transgender people.\nAdvertisementThe statistics are grim for transgender individuals in the US.\nErgo, to Jacob, discrimination is when he gets a smaller slice of pie then his sister.\nI can empathize with a parent\u2019s fear for their child\u2019s safety but I cannot condone baseless fearmongering.\nAn \u201cAct Relative to Transgender Anti-Discrimination\u201d extends to transgender individuals the legal protections already afforded to people of color, members of the LGB community, and the differently abled: They may not be harassed in facilities such as restaurants, stores, hospitals, and airports."}
