LINCOLN, Neb. — Tommy Armstrong drove Nebraska 91 yards in 38 seconds, hitting Brandon Reilly with a 30-yard touchdown pass that survived a video review with 17 seconds left to hand sixth-ranked Michigan State a 39-38 loss that likely will ruin the Spartans’ playoff hopes.

Armstrong rallied the Cornhuskers from 12 points down in the last 4 ½ minutes. He scored on a short touchdown with 1:47 left to make it 38-33. After Michigan State (8-1, 4-1 Big Ten, No. 7 CFP) went three-and-out, he led the drive that defines his career so far.

Starting at his own 9, he hit Jordan Westerkamp for passes of 28 and 33 yards. Two plays later, he found Reilly for the winning score. Reilly went out of bounds and came back in to make the catch, but officials ruled it was legal because cornerback Jermaine Edmondson forced him out.

The Spartans got a final chance, but Connor Cook passed out of bounds from the Nebraska 41 as time ran out.
