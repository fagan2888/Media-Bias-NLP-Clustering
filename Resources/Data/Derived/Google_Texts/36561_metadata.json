Patrick McHenry maintains strong opposition to abortion, Obamacare\n\nADAM LAWSON\n\nStaff Writer\n\nLincoln County\u2019s representative in Congress is unfazed by this week\u2019s failed attempt to defund Planned Parenthood and repeal the Affordable Care Act.\n\nChief Deputy Whip Patrick McHenry, who represents the county in North Carolina\u2019s 10th Congressional District, sent out a statement shortly after a veto override attempt fell short by a 241-186 vote, pledging to try again once President Barack Obama\u2019s term concludes in January.\n\n\u201cWhile today\u2019s veto override vote failed, it is important to remember what can be accomplished once President Obama leaves office,\u201d McHenry said Tuesday. \u201cI remain fully committed to repealing Obamacare and defunding Planned Parenthood and their heinous acts. Congress has now demonstrated each of these can be achieved in a year\u2019s time.\u201d\n\nMcHenry, a Denver resident, has voiced staunch opposition to abortion since he first took office in 2005. While in Washington, the Republican has championed bills banning federal health insurance coverage for the procedure, voted against allowing human embryonic stem cell research, voted to prohibit transferring minors across state lines for abortions and supported barring family planning assistance that supported abortion.\n\nUndercover videos appearing to show Planned Parenthood workers attempting to sell body parts from abortions went viral last summer. Almost immediately after they were released, McHenry and most of his fellow Republicans in Congress attempted to take action against the women\u2019s rights and health organization.\n\n\u201cIn light of their awful videos that exposed their abortion-for-baby-parts business, we called the Department of Justice to investigate,\u201d McHenry told the Lincoln Times-News on Thursday. \u201cWe\u2019re having hearings and we\u2019re investigating this here on Capitol Hill. The fact is we shouldn\u2019t have taxpayer funding of abortions and so we put a bill on the president\u2019s desk that stops Planned Parenthood from using our tax dollars. That\u2019s a huge step forward.\u201d\n\nIn September, The Hill reported that the DOJ is supporting Planned Parenthood in Louisiana\u2019s attempt to defund the organization. In August, an analysis confirmed that the videos were altered, and last month a Texas grand jury indicted two activists who produced the video on felony charges of tampering with a government record.\n\nPlanned Parenthood isn\u2019t allowed to use federal funds to perform abortion services, though McHenry said it uses that money for \u201cwrap-around services\u201d instead.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019ve sponsored for legislation is to stop this since they are the number-one abortion provider in the country,\u201d he said. \u201cThey provide an average of one abortion every two minutes. Abortions make up 94 percent of their pregnancy services. Rather than give money to Planned Parenthood, I think we should give that money to community health clinics.\u201d\n\nPlanned Parenthood claims only 3 percent of its services are abortion-related, and that STD testing and treatment, cancer screening and prevention and other women\u2019s health services make up a bulk of its total services. That number was widely criticized for treating all services, regardless of cost, equally.\n\nThe 94-percent figure was derived from the Susan B. Anthony List, a pro-life advocacy group aiming to end abortion. The SBA List came to its numbers by comparing abortions to two other pregnancy services, according to the Washington Post.\n\nThe Washington Post\u2019s Fact Checker website argues that both numbers are misleading, and that advocates and opponents of abortion rights claim between 15-37 percent of the organization\u2019s non-government revenue comes from services related to the procedure.\n\nStill, the longtime congressman plans on remaining a staunch abortion opponent. In a 2015 press release, McHenry called the 1973 Supreme Court verdict in Roe v. Wade legalizing abortion nationally a \u201ctragic\u201d decision. His campaign website refers to him as a \u201cleader in the pro-life movement\u201d and the National Right to Life Committee continues to give him a 100-percent grade.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been my agenda to foster the protection of human life from natural conception to natural death and I\u2019ll continue to do that,\u201d McHenry said. \u201cI\u2019ll continue to stand up strongly for the right to the life of the unborn and push back to those who commit abortion.\u201d\n\nIn targeting Obamacare, McHenry wants to replace the Affordable Care Act with something he believes is more practical. He said Congress is working on substantial plans to replace it, and that the only thing standing in the way of progress is a new president.\n\nMcHenry said he wants to negotiate with health insurers and allow people to seek health insurance across state lines.\n\n\u201cObamacare is a disaster,\u201d he said. \u201cIt raises the price of premiums for my constituents. It makes healthcare more expensive, and the plan that I support would replace Obamacare with important measures.\u201d\n\nIf McHenry advances past a March primary against Republican challengers Albert Wiley Jr. and Jeff Gregory, he will face Democratic financial planner Andy Millard in November\u2019s general election.\n\nImage courtesy of LTN File", "article_metadata": {"description": "Rep.
