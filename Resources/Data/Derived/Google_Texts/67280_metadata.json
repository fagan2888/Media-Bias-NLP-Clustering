Entitled \u201cThe Legal Olympian,\u201d the article gushes over Sunstein\u2019s extensive scholarly output, notes his many talents (including squash), and touches briefly on his philosophy of \u201clibertarian paternalism,\u201d according to which the state may help individuals make better choices (for themselves and for society) by giving them a \u201cnudge\u201d without infringing their freedom.\n\nMore than halfway through the article, however, readers are told that Sunstein will not comment on the way he applied that philosophy in the White House. In fact, Sunstein \u201chas a policy against answering any questions about his time in government.\u201d It\u2019s an odd policy, to say the least, for someone who has written an entire book on conspiracy theories. Sunstein also purports to champion James Madison\u2019s ideas about government, but a secretive government does not exactly lend itself to accountability.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nThe Harvard article notes that Sunstein\u2019s regulatory office slowed down its review of new government rules in the run-up to the 2012 presidential elections, hoping\u2013its critics allege\u2013to avoid potential political damage to Obama\u2019s re-election hopes. That, and Sunstein\u2019s refusal to explain himself, together raise suspicions that his \u201clibertarian paternalism\u201d is more about the noun than the adjective\u2013just statism in a new guise, exactly what his most vociferous (and occasionally over-the-top) critics have contended.\n\nWhat looks like just a little \u201cnudge\u201d to Sunstein turns out to be exactly what Alexis de Tocqueville warned about in Democracy in America: a despotism whose power is \u201cabsolute, minute, regular, provident, and mild\u201d; that \u201ccovers the surface of society with a network of small complicated rules, minute and uniform,\u201d that enslaves people \u201cin the minor details of life.\u201d Such despotism must remain unseen and opaque to be most effective. That is precisely why Sunstein\u2019s silence is so telling\u2013and so worrying.\n\nSenior Editor-at-Large Joel B.
