But he\u2019s been slowed down at times by a health issue that appeared at an early age.\n\n\u201cI think I first noticed signs of arthritis when I was eighteen,\u201d Helverson says.\n\nToday his rheumatoid arthritis pain is kept at bay with a new-generation injectable drug called Cimzia.\n\n\u201cWithout the medications I\u2019ve had, I probably would\u2019ve already been retired with disability,\u201d he says.\n\nCimzia, however, doesn\u2019t come cheap. It costs thousands of dollars a month. And getting his insurance company to pay for it hasn\u2019t been easy.\n\nHelverson says when his coverage changed, his insurer told him he\u2019d have to try cheaper, older drugs before it would agree to cover Cimzia. And those older drugs just didn\u2019t work anywhere near as well.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had to come off the truck at times for six weeks at a time\u2026 just because I couldn\u2019t move my hands, couldn\u2019t move my ankles,\u201d he says.\n\nIn the last decade, the percentage of employee insurance plans requiring what\u2019s known as \u201cstep therapy\u201d has more than doubled. And that\u2019s drawn the attention of state lawmakers.\n\nThis year, legislators in Missouri, among other states, are considering bills that would make it easier to get exemptions from step therapy or even override it.\n\nIn fact, no fewer than 16 states have considered step therapy legislation this year, according to the American College of Rheumatology, an Atlanta-based organization that wants to alter the practice.\n\n\u201cThe process for one drug probably takes anywhere from 45 minutes to a couple hours depending on long how it takes my staff member on the phone, on hold, waiting to talk to somebody,\u201d says Dr. Bruce Williams, a family practice physician in Blue Springs, Missouri.\n\nWilliams says the money insurers save through step therapy ends up getting shifted to doctors like him in the form of increased office work. That can add up to hours every day for his small practice.\n\nAnd step therapy, he says, forces him to write a lot of prescriptions that he knows aren\u2019t the best treatment.\n\n\u201cYou have to tell the patient, \u2018This medication is less expensive. I don\u2019t expect it to work as well,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019re possibly going to have some side effects that you might not have with the newer medication.\u2019\u201d\n\nSoaring drug costs\n\nThere are lots of newly insured patients seeking prescription medications these days, thanks to the Affordable Care Act. And thanks to an explosion of new \u2013 and expensive \u2013 breakthrough drugs for treating illnesses like cancer, hepatitis C and arthritis, prescription drug spending in the U.S. last year soared to nearly $375 billion.\n\nPrescription drug providers are under pressure to slow that growth.\n\n\u201cWhat you\u2019re seeing is pharmacy costs are out of control,\u201d says Dr. Steve Miller, chief medical officer for Express Scripts. \u201cYou have to look for opportunities to hold down costs, and step therapy is one of those opportunities which allows us to hold costs in check, which keeps the health care benefit affordable for families.\u201d\n\nBased in St. Louis, Express Scripts is the biggest prescription benefit management company in the United States, providing drug coverage on behalf of insurers like Blue Cross Blue Shield and Anthem as well as the military.\n\nAnd Express Scripts isn\u2019t happy about lawmakers\u2019 proposed changes.\n\nMiller says patients going through step therapy often find that a cheaper drug does the trick, and they stick with it rather than go for a more expensive one. And that, he says, saves tens of billions of dollars a year.\n\nAnd it isn\u2019t just designed to control costs, he says: As more new drugs come onto the market, encouraging older treatment methods is also safer.\n\n\u201cWhen you use the same product over and over again, you actually become very familiar with how it works, what side effects it has and how it works in combination with other side effects and diseases,\u201d he says.\n\nCaleb Alexander, co-director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Drug Safety and Effectiveness, points to another important aspect of step therapy.\n\nHe says that patients asking for drugs they see on TV or in other advertising have exerted considerable influence on doctors\u2019 prescribing practices.\n\n\u201cPatients and doctors and health plans all have to deal with the fact that prescription drugs cost a lot of money and that, all too often, prescribing is not evidence-based or rational,\u201d Alexander says.\n\nWhen done correctly, he says step therapy saves money without sacrificing health. But he acknowledges it shouldn\u2019t lead to ordeals of the kind Glen Helverson went through.\n\n\u201cPatients shouldn\u2019t go through rounds of ineffective medicines in order to qualify for an alternative treatment approach,\u201d he says.\n\nHigher costs?\n\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with step therapy, at least in theory, says Tami Mark, vice president and research director of behavioral health and quality research at Truven Health Analytics, a health care data company.\n\n\u201cBut in practice what happens is that patients, when you put them on step therapy, they\u2019re less likely to fill the medication,\u201d Mark says.\n\nMark has led studies exploring how step therapy affects patients who take antidepressants and blood pressure medications. She found that it can discourage them from getting needed treatment. In some cases, their condition can worsen, which may result in higher costs in the long run.\n\n\u201cBecause they were less likely to fill,\u201d Mark says. \u201cWe also saw an increase in emergency department and in-patient utilization and costs on the medical care side.\u201d\n\nThe American College of Rheumatology initially sought to ban the practice altogether. But strong resistance led the organization to scale back its ambitions, according Dr. Will Harvey, chair of its government affairs committee.\n\nHarvey says that of the measures considered in 16 states this year, two have already died. Missouri lawmakers are still trying to decide before the legislative session adjourns later this month.\n\nBack at the fire station, Glenn Helverson is hopeful.\n\nHe says he understands the need for step therapy and doesn\u2019t think it should be scrapped altogether. But he wants to see it used in a way that gives more authority back to doctors.\n\n\u201cTake the physicians that\u2019s been in school for 14 years and now in practice and has a personal relationship with the patient and can take that and tell the insurance company, \u2018This is where the patient needs to be and where we need to keep him.\u2019\u201d\n\nAlex Smith is a reporter for KCUR, a partner in the Heartland Health Monitor team.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health", "description": "Glenn Helverson has a job that\u2019s all about speed.
