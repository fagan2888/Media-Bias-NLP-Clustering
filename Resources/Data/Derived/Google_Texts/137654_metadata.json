Grassley says no to doing the work assigned him by the constitution. He gets paid a hell of a lot of money for that. He has a big staff, a huge office plus offices around the state that we pay for. Since his last election, despite the good pay and incredibly excellent benefits, Chuck Grassley has refused to do his job.\n\nThe past couple of years have been almost landmark in how to dis your boss (us) and stay employed. Grassley signs a letter that interferes in negotiations with Iran. Is it treason? You decide, but it is certainly a kick in the face for our country.\n\nThen as chair of the Judiciary Committee, Grassley has pretty much stopped appointing judges to the federal bench. This is causing a crisis in our judicial system. Why? Just to obstruct the President, that is all. Thwarting the constitution bust to obstruct the president.\n\nGrassley also jumped on the big train to tear down Hillary Clinton. Apparently Ms. Clinton hasn\u2019t given Grassley the proper respect so for a while he held up all appointments to the State Department. Grassley must not have realized Ms. Clinton was no longer Secretary of State. This little snit on Grassley\u2019s part almost caused major problems for the US at the time of the terrorist attacks in Paris. Leaders in other countries tried to deal with our embassies at that time only to find many way understaffed to deal with a crisis.\n\nNow we come to the death of a Supreme Court Justice. The founders anticipated that men would become feeble and die, so they made provisions for replacement of these men. How to do this is in the constitution. Grassley as a senator refuses to do his job.\n\nWhen an elected public official refuses to do their job, we have an obligation to remove that official. It is too bad that there isn\u2019t some provision for withholding pay and benefits (including those free flights home) until said official decides it is in his interest to do his job. Makes one also wonder why he needs a staff.\n\nUltimately we do have the power, if we decide to use it. We should be sick and tired of Grassley\u2019s games by now. At this point he is laughing at us and our inability to remove him from office. We are the ones who must stand up and tell him that he represents us and not his party.\n\nGrassley has represented his party and not represented Iowa for decades. Now that his party is only the party of not just NO but HELL NO (to quote John Boehner) it is time to tell Chuck \u201cyou\u2019re FIRED!\u201d His refusal to represent us while only representing his party is doing us and the country harm. The game is over, Chuck.\n\nGrassley\u2019 contact form is here:\n\nGrassley\u2019s offices are:\n\nCedar Rapids\n\n111 7th Avenue SE, Box 13\n\nSuite 6800\n\nCedar Rapids, IA 52401\n\n(319) 363-6832\n\nFax: (319) 363-7179\n\n\n\nCouncil Bluffs\n\n307 Federal Building\n\n8 South 6th Street\n\nCouncil Bluffs, IA 51501\n\n(712) 322-7103\n\nFax: (712) 322-7196\n\nDavenport\n\n201 West 2nd Street\n\nSuite 720\n\nDavenport, IA 52801\n\n(563) 322-4331\n\nFax: (563) 322-8552\n\nDes Moines\n\n721 Federal Building\n\n210 Walnut Street\n\nDes Moines, IA 50309\n\n(515) 288-1145\n\nFax: (515) 288-5097\n\nSioux City\n\n120 Federal Building\n\n320 6th Street\n\nSioux City, IA 51101\n\n(712) 233-1860\n\nFax: (712) 233-1634\n\n\n\nWaterloo\n\n210 Waterloo Building\n\n531 Commercial Street\n\nWaterloo, IA 50701\n\n(319) 232-6657\n\nFax: (319) 232-9965\n\nWashington, D.C.\n\n135 Hart Senate Office Building\n\nWashington, D.C. 20510\n\n(202) 224-3744\n\nFax: (202) 224-6020", "article_metadata": {}, "article_summary": "Since his last election, despite the good pay and incredibly excellent benefits, Chuck Grassley has refused to do his job.\nGrassley has represented his party and not represented Iowa for decades.\nApparently Ms. Clinton hasn\u2019t given Grassley the proper respect so for a while he held up all appointments to the State Department.\nThen as chair of the Judiciary Committee, Grassley has pretty much stopped appointing judges to the federal bench.\nGrassley must not have realized Ms. Clinton was no longer Secretary of State."}
