The New England Journal of Medicine 2015\n\nWhen you're riding your bike, the most terrifying accident you can have \u2014 traffic injuries aside \u2014 is probably as minimal as falling off and scraping your knee. A 40-year-old man was off-road biking in New Mexico when he flipped off of his bike. As he got up, he realized that he had a branch sticking out the side of his neck. Instead of sitting down, calling an ambulance, and waiting for it to arrive, however, the man drove himself 20 miles to the nearest hospital.\n\nThere, surgeons took a CT scan and found the branch had narrowly missed his windpipe and the carotid artery, which connects the brain to the heart. If either one had been impacted by the branch, it was unlikely that the man would\u2019ve survived.\n\nThe branch was buried more than a half inch into the man\u2019s neck. Speaking to LiveScience, the attending physician, Lev Deriy, said that the man was \u201clucky not to damage anything.\u201d\n\nSo far, after having the branch removed and the hole stitched up, the man has suffered no further complications, his doctors said. He was also very wise not to remove the branch from his neck. Removing an impaled object in a panic could lead to extreme consequences, so doctors state that, if you ever find yourself in a similar situation, you should immediately go to a hospital.\n\n\"If you have something like that happen, it\u2019s a good idea not to touch [the] foreign body,\" Deriy said.\n\nBikes have led to a few different impalements recently, like this woman in London whose leg was impaled by the brake lever when she flipped off her bike. Or this man in New York who hit a pothole, fell, and hit his head, then tried to get up and impaled his neck on a fence.\n\nAnother man was also impaled by a tree branch while cycling two years ago in the UK in nearly the same place as the man from New Mexico. He also survived the impaling and made a full recovery.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "cyclist impale tree branch hospital", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A cyclist in New Mexico was impaled by a tree branch after flipping his bike, so he drove himself to the hospital 20 miles away.", "title": "With A Tree Branch In His Neck, This Cyclist Drove Himself To The Hospital", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/keep-calm-man-gets-impaled-neck-tree-branch-while-mountain-biking-drives-himself-344786", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/07/27/cyclist-impaled.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A cyclist in New Mexico was impaled by a tree branch after flipping his bike, so he drove himself to the hospital 20 miles away.", "title": "With A Tree Branch In His Neck, This Cyclist Drove Himself To The Hospital", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/keep-calm-man-gets-impaled-neck-tree-branch-while-mountain-biking-drives-himself-344786", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/07/27/cyclist-impaled.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/07/27/cyclist-impaled.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Weird Medicine", "published_time": "2015-07-27T14:25:22-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-27T14:25:21-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A cyclist in New Mexico was impaled by a tree branch after flipping his bike, so he drove himself to the hospital 20 miles away."}, "article_summary": "A cyclist in New Mexico was impaled in the neck by a tree branch, then drove himself to the hospital.\nInstead of sitting down, calling an ambulance, and waiting for it to arrive, however, the man drove himself 20 miles to the nearest hospital.\nAnother man was also impaled by a tree branch while cycling two years ago in the UK in nearly the same place as the man from New Mexico.\nA 40-year-old man was off-road biking in New Mexico when he flipped off of his bike.\nAs he got up, he realized that he had a branch sticking out the side of his neck."}
