Obamacare and its exchanges preserve the illusion of a free market for insurance coverage, but we\u2019re inching ever closer to the left\u2019s dream of \u201csingle-payer,\u201d a system of one-size-fits-all medical treatment organized by the government. Price controls are the next step toward that goal.\n\nLawmakers and lobbyists turned green with envy Tuesday as drug maker Gilead Sciences Inc. announced that it had sold $2.8 billion worth of the drug called Sovaldi in the past quarter. This $84,000 drug cures Hepatitis C, a liver ailment responsible for about 15,000 deaths annually. It has one major side effect: It infects politicians with inside-the-Beltway banditry.\n\nTo date, this drug has treated 117,000 patients, with nine out of 10 patients reporting themselves cured for good. It sounds like a true miracle drug. A 12-week treatment at $84,000 is expensive, to be sure, but less so than the previous method of buying drugs to cover the symptoms over the course of a lifetime. Reps. Henry A. Waxman of California and Diana DeGette of Colorado, both Democrats, wrote earlier this year to House Energy and Commerce Chairman Fred Upton of Michigan, a Republican, to demand that Gilead Sciences Inc. be called before the congressional panel to justify the price of the drug.\n\n\u201cIn March 2014, we wrote to Gilead to ask for a briefing on the high cost of Sovaldi,\u201d they wrote. \u201cThe company provided this briefing, but did not provide a compelling justification for the high price they are charging for most patients in the United States.\u201d\n\nSince when do private companies need to explain such decisions to politicians? Since the imposition of Obamacare, obviously.\n\nRather than rejoice at the miracle of modern science conquering a particularly nasty disease, the company that sank billions into researching the cure is attacked with demands for price controls. The lobbying group America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans doesn\u2019t like such upfront cures, because insurance companies get stuck with much of the bill. If patients pay out for co-pays over the course of decades, insurance companies pay a lower percentage of the cost of treatment.\n\n\u201cBenefit design alone, however, cannot solve the challenge posed by the dramatic increase of prescription-drug prices that puts lifesaving cures out-of-reach for millions of Americans,\u201d says the group\u2019s spokesman. \u201cUltimately, that will require drugmakers to price their products at sustainable levels.\u201d\n\nEnacting price controls would create \u201csustainable\u201d prices, but it\u2019s a surefire method of closing the research laboratories hunting for groundbreaking treatments and cures. The spools of government red tape clog the process of the approval needed to bring a drug to market, which can require a decade\u2019s time. Gilead last quarter paid a $337 million \u201cbranded prescription drug\u201d fee under Obamacare, for example. Companies do this because a breakthrough typically produces a billion-dollar payout.\n\nLiberals and others who flunked Economics 101 call this \u201cprice gouging\u201d and demand that the government put a stop to it. Market competition will prevent actual gouging far more efficiently than the government can. Already, a shorter treatment for Hepatitis C has been effective in certain patients at a 30 percent discount.\n\nWhen government decides what prices are just and reasonable, the companies with the best lobbyists and offering the most generous campaign contributions can expect to prosper. Cronies can\u2019t produce cures, but they know how to extract the most cash from the pockets of patients and the government. An Obama administration that can\u2019t set up a functioning Obamacare website for $1 billion isn\u2019t likely to find cures for dandruff or hangnails, but it can get in the way of those who can cure serious disease.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Socialized health care in the United States comes by incrementalism.
