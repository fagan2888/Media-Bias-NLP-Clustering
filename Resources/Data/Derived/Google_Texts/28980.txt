Glenn Beck’s radio co-host Pat Gray on Monday published a blistering commentary piece claiming Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) is “the worst living human being on the planet.”

Gray cited a number of reasons, but focused on Reid’s recent Senate floor declaration that all the “horror stories” of Obamacare adversely impacting Americans are “untrue” and “tales made up out of whole cloth.”

On Glenn Beck’s radio program Thursday, Gray played a montage of Americans and reporters discussing how the new health care law has affected them, interspersed with Reid’s comments.

“You decide which one is the despicable human being,” Gray said with disgust.
