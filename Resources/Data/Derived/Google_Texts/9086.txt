GREELEY — Daughters of a former Weld County sheriff’s deputy accused of killing his wife are set to testify for the prosecution at his upcoming trial.

The Greeley Tribune reports that a judge ruled Thursday that the girls can take the stand during Tom Fallis’ trial, which starts March 14.

Prosecutors say the former deputy shot his wife, 28-year-old Ashley Fallis, after a party at their Evans home Jan. 1, 2012.

The death was ruled a suicide, but the case was reopened in April 2014. Fallis’ lawyers say Ashley Fallis committed suicide and have introduced a suicide note that was written before her death. Fallis moved to Bloomington, Ind., with his three children after his wife’s death.
