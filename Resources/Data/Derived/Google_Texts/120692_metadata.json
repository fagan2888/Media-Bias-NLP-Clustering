( Maya Sugarman/KPCC )\n\nThe state plans to significantly expand the scope of the cleanup of lead-tainted soil from properties around the former Exide plant in Vernon, but its efforts to date have been incomplete, as many homeowners have passed up the opportunity to have professionals also clean the interiors of their homes.\n\nOf the 174 property owners in Boyle Heights and Maywood who have had soil removed from their yards, only 44 have requested the accompanying interior cleanup, according to the Department of Toxic Substances Control, which is overseeing the effort. The operation began after the agency found elevated levels of lead in the soil of homes around Exide\u2019s now shuttered battery recycling facility.\n\nInterviews with residents whose yards were the subjects of remediation, along with a review of the letter offering an interior cleaning, suggest that at least one of the reasons so few have taken that step is miscommunication.\n\n\u201cThe agency is not doing a good enough job in conveying that we are cleaning up poison from homes and not just dust,\u201d says Mark Lopez, executive director of East Yard Communities for Environmental Justice.\n\nBecause dirt contaminated with lead can easily make its way from a yard to a living room, the state\u2019s remediation operation includes a free cleaning of the affected homes with a HEPA vacuum. HEPA stands for High Efficiency Particulate Air; the vaccum is an industrial strength machine outfitted with special filters that can trap tiny particles.\n\nA \u2018Voucher for a Maid Service\u2019\n\nMaldonado Raul of Boyle Heights had his yard cleaned, but he says he did not follow up on the offer for the interior work because he already has a woman who cleans his house.\n\n\u201cNo no, I don\u2019t want [another] lady who comes and cleans inside the house,\u201d says Raul, noting that he also passed on the offer to clean the interiors of the two rental units he owns on his street.\n\nReiser Torres of Maywood says his mom, who owns their house, had a similar reaction.\n\nRead the rest of this story at KPCC.org.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Advocates say that residents aren't opting for interior clean up because the state is not clearly explaining the need.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Critics Charge State Needs Better Outreach in Exide Clean Up\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2015\\/12\\/15\\/critics-charge-state-needs-better-outreach-in-exide-clean-up\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-12-15 00:07:15\",\"mod_date\":\"2015-12-15 10:48:43\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":123630,\"author_id\":\"8344\",\"author_name\":\"State of Health\",\"author_display_name\":\"State of Health\",\"tags\":[\"Exide\",\"News\"],\"categories\":[\"Community Health\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2015\\/12\\/90098-full.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "Advocates say that residents aren't opting for interior clean up because the state is not clearly explaining the need.", "title": "Critics Charge State Needs Better Outreach in Exide Clean Up", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2015/12/15/critics-charge-state-needs-better-outreach-in-exide-clean-up/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2015/12/90098-full.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "exide,news", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1df9\"", "article_summary": "A sign posted in front one of the first houses in Boyle Heights that had its lead-tainted soil removed.\nThe operation began after the agency found elevated levels of lead in the soil of homes around Exide\u2019s now shuttered battery recycling facility.\nHEPA stands for High Efficiency Particulate Air; the vaccum is an industrial strength machine outfitted with special filters that can trap tiny particles.\nReiser Torres of Maywood says his mom, who owns their house, had a similar reaction.\nOf the 174 property owners in Boyle Heights and Maywood who have had soil removed from their yards, only 44 have requested the accompanying interior cleanup, according to the Department of Toxic Substances Control, which is overseeing the effort."}
