When asked about a course to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, the president reiterated that the healthcare law does not make coverage available to people who are in the U.S. illegally, Obama said during a private event at Taylor Stratton Elementary School \u2013 his third visit in 18 months to a Nashville public school.\n\nIt was a point Obama has made before when faced with questions of whether the president\u2019s healthcare law would mean millions of undocumented immigrants would suddenly get free healthcare through Obamacare. Under the law, undocumented immigrants are not eligible for federal coverage, including Medicare and nonemergency Medicaid, however they could access emergency care under federal law. They also cannot purchase private health insurance through state insurance exchanges, according to the National Immigration Law Center.\n\nThe president\u2019s Nashville visit follows a Supreme Court ruling last week that solidified the future of the president\u2019s signature healthcare overhaul. The case of King v. Burwell dealt with insurance subsidies in states that opted not to set up their own health insurance exchanges. Ultimately, the justices ruled 6-3 that federal subsidies were available to people living in states without their own exchanges. \u201cIn other words, State Exchanges and Federal Exchanges are equivalent -- they must meet the same requirements, perform the same functions, and serve the same purposes,\u201d Justice John G. Roberts wrote in the court\u2019s majority opinion.\n\nPhoto: Reuters\n\nOn Wednesday, the president stressed the merits of his healthcare law, including that it benefited between 100 and 150 million Americans, whether they knew it or not. \u201cYou\u2019re able to get free preventive care, including mammograms, as a consequence of this law,\u201d the president said Wednesday. He added that he felt \u201cpretty good\u201d about how his healthcare law had panned out.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://s2.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "obama on immigration, immigration reform, immigration reform 2015, immigration obamacare, obama nashville, obama nashville speech, obama affordable care act, supreme court ruling obamacare, obamacare, obama nashville visit", "og": {"site_name": "International Business Times", "description": "The president\u2019s Nashville visit follows a Supreme Court ruling last week that solidified the future of the president\u2019s signature healthcare overhaul.", "title": "Obama Immigration Reform 2015: Illegal Immigrants In US Won\u2019t Get Free Healthcare Under Obamacare, Says President", "url": "http://www.ibtimes.com/obama-immigration-reform-2015-illegal-immigrants-us-wont-get-free-healthcare-under-1992982", "image": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2015/07/01/obama.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The president\u2019s Nashville visit follows a Supreme Court ruling last week that solidified the future of the president\u2019s signature healthcare overhaul.", "title": "Obama Immigration Reform 2015: Illegal Immigrants In US Won\u2019t Get Free Healthcare Under Obamacare, Says President", "url": "http://www.ibtimes.com/obama-immigration-reform-2015-illegal-immigrants-us-wont-get-free-healthcare-under-1992982", "image": {"src": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2015/07/01/obama.jpg", "identifier": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2015/07/01/obama.jpg"}, "site": "@IBTimes", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#000000", "fb": {"app_id": 263851690471857, "pages": 128026713884051}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/IBTimes", "section": "World", "published_time": "2015-07-01T18:13:40-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-02T00:50:16-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "The president\u2019s Nashville visit follows a Supreme Court ruling last week that solidified the future of the president\u2019s signature healthcare overhaul."}, "article_summary": "It was a point Obama has made before when faced with questions of whether the president\u2019s healthcare law would mean millions of undocumented immigrants would suddenly get free healthcare through Obamacare.\nUnder the law, undocumented immigrants are not eligible for federal coverage, including Medicare and nonemergency Medicaid, however they could access emergency care under federal law.\nHe added that he felt \u201cpretty good\u201d about how his healthcare law had panned out.\nThe president\u2019s Nashville visit follows a Supreme Court ruling last week that solidified the future of the president\u2019s signature healthcare overhaul.\nThe case of King v.
