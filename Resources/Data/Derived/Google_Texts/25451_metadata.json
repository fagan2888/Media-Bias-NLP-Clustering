Now imagine that patient is a 6-year old boy.\n\nThat scenario played out at Arnold Palmer Hospital for Children at Orlando Health, and an incredibly dogged doctor found a way to found a way to save the child and challenge some established ideas in orthopedics.\n\n\u201cHe basically saved my life,\u201d says 14-year-old Daniel Stephens. He\u2019s talking about the man he calls his hero: Pediatric Orthopedic Surgeon Dr. Jonathan Phillips.\n\nDaniel has early onset scoliosis- that\u2019s a progressive curvature of the spine that, if left untreated, would crush his lungs and kill him. The standard treatment is a set of surgically implanted titanium rods that slowly straighten his spine out. Dr. Phillips and Daniel\u2019s parents, Dawn and Bill Stephens, pick up the story from here, beginning with Dr. Phillips.\n\n\u201cThe surgery went fine, we did well, initially, but then he started to get into all kinds of trouble, we couldn\u2019t figure out what was going on initially, we thought this was just an infection, which unfortunately is a fairly common complication of early onset scoliosis, it turned out to be something more unusual and peculiar than that,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cHe had all this itching going on, he was running a fever, he had all these bizarre symptoms, so part of the scary was, what\u2019s wrong with Daniel, you know?\u201d said Bill Stephens.\n\n\u201cAnd he continued to progress and get sick, he would have trouble breathing, he had nerve pain, he was on a different medication, he was taking medication every two hours 24 hours a day,\u201d said Dawn Stephens.\n\n\u201cAnd then one day he came into the clinic and it was like a light bulb went off in my head, I said- he\u2019s allergic to titanium, and this of course is an extremely rare problem, it\u2019s been identified in the dental literature as an allergy to dental implants but I\u2019d never seen it, never even heard of it in orthopedics, so this was something that was very weird,\u201d says Phillips.\n\n\u201cI remember Dr. Phillips consulting with other doctors, you know, asking, what is the possibility that he could be allergic to the equipment in his back? And they were like, oh no, that could never happen,\u201d Bill Stephens said.\n\nA blood test confirmed Daniel was, in fact, allergic to titanium, along with any other metal that could be used in an implant. The rods in his back had to come out.\n\n\u201cIt was a rollercoaster for me because when we had to take the implants out because of this \u201cquote\u201d infection, which wasn\u2019t actually, it was an allergy, his spine collapsed like a deck of cards and I knew that if we didn\u2019t come up with a solution he was not going to make it and so this was an extremely frightening kind of thing to deal with as a surgeon because I just didn\u2019t have a solution,\u201d Phillips said.\n\nDaniel had to have the rods in his back replaced or he would die. The question was what to make them out of. Any material used needed the strength of titanium, and it needed to accommodate a sliding part- which ruled out any kind of rubber coating.\n\n\u201cHis spine would not relent,\u201d said Dawn Stephens, \u201cit continued to progress and we were told, and we know, if we can\u2019t stop the progression and the aggressiveness of his scoliosis, that he will asphyxiate and just not wake up one morning.\u201d\n\nPhillips consulted with doctors all over the world. He consulted with NASA. He consulted with anyone he could think of. Then he thought about carbon coated sailboat masts. Could the titanium rods be coated with carbon? Yes, said engineers, they could plasma coat it.\n\n\u201cSo essentially what we did was camouflage the titanium from Daniel\u2019s immune system, so we bamboozled it so it never knew that it was there,\u201d Phillips said.\n\nDaniel requires surgery every four to six months to adjust his implants. The Stephens say their church has held numerous fundraisers throughout the years to help with Daniel\u2019s medical costs.\n\nThat was seven years ago. Daniel, a kid who wasn\u2019t expected to live, is now studying for his learners permit. Looking back, Daniel\u2019s parents say Dr. Phillips\u2019 independent thinking is what saved him.\n\n\u201cIt gave us hope for the next day of Daniel\u2019s life, cause we\u2019re never promised anything with him, as long as Dr. Phillips was working towards it, we had hope for prolonging his life expectancy, \u201d says Dawn Phillips.\n\nDaniel\u2019s case has just been published in Spine Deformity \u2013 The Official Journal of the Scoliosis Research Society. Phillips says as far as he knows, this is the first documented case of its kind.", "article_metadata": {"category": "HNF Stories", "description": "Imagine being a doctor with a patient at risk of dying, but the one treatment available to help that patient makes him critically ill.
