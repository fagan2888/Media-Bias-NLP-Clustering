Mexico is offering a $3.8 million dollar reward for the drug lord who escaped from prison three days ago. In this image released by Mexico's Attorney General's Office, Saturday, Feb. 22, 2014, Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman is photographed against a wall after his arrest in the Pacific resort city of Mazatlan, Mexico. After 13 years on the run, narrow escapes from the military, law enforcement and rivals, Joaquin \u00e2??El Chapo\u00e2?\u009d Guzman is back in Mexican custody. Now starts what is likely to be a lengthy and complicated legal process to decide which country gets to try him first.

Our neighbors to the south would have us believe that they are surprised, that he was able to escape but I for one am not. The corruption in Mexico is just out of this world. I find it hard to believe that a mile-long tunnel can be constructed without any detection. For a project of this magnitude to go unnoticed would have required a lot of pockets to be filled.\n\nSome theories have it that Joaquin Guzman just walked out the front door of the prison. Mexican officials rejected requests to have El Chapo brought to the United States for a trial and incarceration. I guess we know why. That would be a long way to make a tunnel? Drug money talks, and digs tunnels too.\n\nPatrick Hommerding,\n\nMerrill\n\nRead or Share this story: http://wdhne.ws/1ROWZjB", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Drug kingpin\u2019s escape shows how corrupt Mexico really is.", "og": {"site_name": "Daily Herald Media", "description": "Drug kingpin\u2019s escape shows how corrupt Mexico really is.", "title": "Drug money bought \u2018El Chapo\u2019 freedom from prison", "url": "http://www.wausaudailyherald.com/story/opinion/readers/2015/07/22/drug-money-bought-el-chapo-freedom-prison/30500623/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/wausaudailyherald.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Drug kingpin\u2019s escape shows how corrupt Mexico really is.", "title": "Drug money bought \u2018El Chapo\u2019 freedom from prison", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1f479778c5d61da6ec18af8660c0ffdbc9b9031e/c=0-0-960-960&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/07/22/Wausau/B9318175883Z.1_20150722004025_000_G8SBDQMCT.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@wausauherald", "site": "@wausauherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=884268453", "fb": {"app_id": 187427251271455}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb2c6\"", "article_summary": "(AP Photo/PGR) (Photo: Uncredited / AP)EDITOR: \u201cEl Chapo\u201d the Mexican drug kingpin is gone after his escape from a maximum security prison.\nAPJoaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman in 2014, after his arrest in Mazatlan, Mexico.\n?El Chapo\u00e2?\u009d Guzman is back in Mexican custody.\nMexican officials rejected requests to have El Chapo brought to the United States for a trial and incarceration.\nIn this image released by Mexico's Attorney General's Office, Saturday, Feb. 22, 2014, Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman is photographed against a wall after his arrest in the Pacific resort city of Mazatlan, Mexico."}
