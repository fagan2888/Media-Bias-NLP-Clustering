Story highlights Pelosi said flatly on Wednesday, "We're not running on any platform of raising taxes"

Pelosi sidestepped a question about the growing concerns of fellow Democrats about the impact Sanders could have on 2016 House and Senate races

Baltimore (CNN) House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi maintains she isn't taking sides in the Democratic primary for president, but pushed back against Bernie Sanders' pledge that he would raise taxes to pay for his health care plan, saying flatly on Wednesday, "We're not running on any platform of raising taxes."

Speaking at the House Democratic Caucus' annual retreat here, Pelosi sidestepped a question about the growing concerns of fellow Democrats over the impact Sanders could have on 2016 House and Senate races, saying, "I'm very proud of all three of our candidates."

But the top House Democrat didn't mince words when it came to Vermont Senator Sanders' health care proposal, dismissing the notion of a single-payer health care plan, curtly saying, "That's not going to happen."

Pelosi did acknowledge Sanders' appeal, however.

"The fact is that Bernie Sanders is enlarging the universe of people who are paying attention to the election and we hope that he will bring them to the polls in November to support the Democratic nominee," she said.
