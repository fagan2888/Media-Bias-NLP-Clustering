Batkins notes that the aggregate impact to comply with the various regulations is $1.9 billion and 11.3 million hours. The study likens this to a \u201cregulatory tax of 3 to 5 percent,\u201d effects of which will be felt by consumers and workers.\n\n\u201cLast year, AAF predicted: \u2018If past is prologue, the 2014 report on ACA burdens will catalogue higher costs, more paperwork, and additional layers of red tape on the U.S. healthcare system,\u201d Batkins wrote. \u201cThe results are in: $4.5 billion in higher costs and 48 million more paperwork hours.\n\n\u201cWithout significant reforms, expect similar results in 2015,\u201d he added.\n\nHey, but remember what House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) last week. Obamacare is \u201caffordable.\u201d Pay no attention those premium hikes and heavy compliance burdens. Just keep repeating the lie often enough until people believe it.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Affordable Care Act,American Action Forum,compliance,compliance costs,ObamaCare,paperwork,regulations,regulatory burden,Sam Batkins,Politics,News,Blog,Current,Alternative,Libertarian,Freedom,Election,Nonpartisan,Ron Paul", "description": "The heavy regulatory and paperwork burdens that Obamacare has brought to businesses and states is not worth the costs, according to a new study by the American Action Forum, a conservative think tank.While most have focused on the premium and deductible", "robots": "index,follow", "copyright": "(c) 2005-2013 United Liberty", "DC.Title": "Obamacare regulatory burdens outweigh benefits"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9836\"", "article_summary": "\u201cAt more than 159 million paperwork hours, the ACA is in a class by itself,\u201d he noted.\nBatkins notes that the aggregate impact to comply with the various regulations is $1.9 billion and 11.3 million hours.\n\u201cThe results are in: $4.5 billion in higher costs and 48 million more paperwork hours.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s more troubling, the law has generated just $2.6 billion in annualized benefits, compared to $6.8 billion in annualized costs.\n\u201cTo date, Dodd-Frank, an equally transformational law, has imposed \u2018only\u2019 60 million hours of paperwork.\u201dThe study, for example, notes that Americans will spend 7.5 million hours complying with the individual mandate and business owners will have to spend 40.2 million hours dealing with reporting requirements."}
