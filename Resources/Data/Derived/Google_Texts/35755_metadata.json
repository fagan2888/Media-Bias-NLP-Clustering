Now, he needs running mates.\n\nThe greatest trick anyone ever pulled was convincing the world the Nuggets have no tradition. And because of that, last week was a big week in turning the tide. A huge week, in fact.\n\nDikembe Mutombo \u2014 nicknamed Mount Mutombo by the city that knows peaks \u2014 was named to the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame. Two days later, the Nuggets organization pulled off one of its savviest moves of the season when it brought back Lever to be honored in the way that tradition-rich franchises always honor their great athletes.\n\nThose events opened the door to a larger discussion to be had about just how big a basketball town Denver really has been. Forty-eight years of NBA (39) and ABA (nine) basketball says its roots run deep.\n\nTradition is as nebulous a concept as the never-ending debate on whether title rings equal greatness.\n\nAre multiple title banners the only indicator of true tradition?\n\nOf course not.\n\nTradition is a fabric woven with everything that makes up the whole \u2014 from great teams and great moments to struggles to characters to players to, yes, winning. The Nuggets have been as unusual as the city they play in. They have a style of play directly connected to them, a style that concerns most any team arriving in the Mile High City that has to deal with it. And never more than this season has there been such an outcry to link back to their fast-breaking past.\n\nTraditionally, the Nuggets have been a running team.\n\nAnd yet the belief that permeates is the opposite. Chests should be puffed out, Lever style, knowing there is great worth to the Nuggets, and always has been. Instead, so many view their support in a defensive manner, assuming a heads-down, slumped-shoulders posture about embracing what the franchise really is.\n\nAnd that impacts everything from holding the organization accountable to continuing to push to win big instead of just settling for being entertaining. Why would a free agent want to come play for the little ol\u2019 Nuggets?\n\nHere\u2019s why: David Thompson, Dan Issel, Alex English, Doug Moe, Larry Brown, Fat Lever. There are Hall of Famers, three executives of the year, two NBA coaches of the year, one NBA scoring champion, a streak of 10 straight years in the playoffs.\n\nAnd five retired jerseys. It is inevitable Mutombo\u2019s will be the sixth.\n\nSunday, a 1,000-win coach comes to town. George Karl got 423 of those wins in nine seasons with the Nuggets.\n\nInterim coach Melvin Hunt believes Mutombo\u2019s and Lever\u2019s moments in the sun helped illuminate the team\u2019s tradition as well.\n\n\u201cAnytime you get some positive publicity, there are good things happening within your organization,\u201d he said. \u201cThe great Alex English, David Thompson \u2026 I think it goes a long way. We\u2019ve done some nice things here.\u201d\n\nChristopher Dempsey: cdempsey @denverpost.com or twitter.com/ dempseypost", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Dempsey: Nuggets have plenty of tradition even without championships", "title": "Dempsey: Nuggets have plenty of tradition even without championships", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/04/11/dempsey-nuggets-have-plenty-of-tradition-even-without-championships/", "image": {"width": 512, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg", "height": 512}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-11T23:20:11+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-25T01:36:07+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc07a\"", "article_summary": "Tradition is a fabric woven with everything that makes up the whole \u2014 from great teams and great moments to struggles to characters to players to, yes, winning.\nChests should be puffed out, Lever style, knowing there is great worth to the Nuggets, and always has been.\nThe greatest trick anyone ever pulled was convincing the world the Nuggets have no tradition.\nInterim coach Melvin Hunt believes Mutombo\u2019s and Lever\u2019s moments in the sun helped illuminate the team\u2019s tradition as well.\nThe Nuggets have been as unusual as the city they play in."}
