Police have said that Collins is not a suspect, but said they want to bring him in for questioning regarding the murder of 29-year-old Brittany Mills, with whom he had a previous relationship.\n\nLa\u2019el Collins tried to avoid the NFL Draft, with his agent trying to have La\u2019el pulled so he could re-enter next year, when the investigation would presumably be completed. But the NFL rejected the bid, leading La\u2019el\u2019s agent to try another tactic.\n\nNFL.com reported as follows.\n\n\u201cCollins\u2019 representatives had told clubs that Collins would refuse to sign with a team that drafted him outside the third round and that Collins would simply re-enter the draft in 2016. However, that is not an option according to NFL rules, NFL Media Insider Ian Rapoport reported Saturday. Teams were wary of drafting Collins until they know more information. The opinion across football has been relatively simple: Wait until the investigation process runs its course.\u201d\n\nLa\u2019el Collins ended up going undrafted, but he has already attracted quite a bit of attention in free agency. Both the Miami Dolphins and Buffalo Bills are rumored to be making a run at Collins, with the Bills taking the more aggressive path.\n\nOn Monday, Bills coach Rex Ryan met with La\u2019el Collins for dinner in Baton Rouge. It\u2019s not known whether the Bills have offered a contract, but Collins was reportedly upbeat after the meeting.\n\nJust talked with #laelcollins who told me \u201cGod is good\u201d he left with @buffalobills head coach. Neither saying anything about meeting @WBRZ \u2014 Brett Buffington (@BrettBuffington) May 5, 2015\n\nCollins may actually have helped his own career by going undrafted. As a rookie free agent, he would be able to sign a shorter contract, allowing him to prove himself in the league and erase concerns about his character, then get an earlier shot at a big contract.\n\nSigning La\u2019el Collins would not be entirely out of character for the new Buffalo Bills. Under Rex Ryan, the team has taken a number of chances on players with previous character concerns. Ryan signed guard Richie Incognito after he spent a year away from football, and later signed Percy Harvin, who has reportedly caused strife in the locker room in previous stints.\n\n[Image via Getty Images/Al Messerschmidt]", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Buffalo Bills are rumored to be trying to land one of the most talented, but also controversial, players to come out of the college ranks, with coach Rex", "og": {"site_name": "The Inquisitr News", "description": "The Buffalo Bills are rumored to be trying to land one of the most talented, but also controversial, players to come out of the college ranks, with coach Rex", "title": "Buffalo Bills Rumors: Rex Ryan Flies To Baton Rouge To Meet With La\u2019el Collins, Bills Could Sign Troubled Lineman", "url": "http://www.inquisitr.com/2065710/buffalo-bills-rumors-rex-ryan-flies-to-baton-rouge-to-meet-with-lael-collins-bills-could-sign-troubled-lineman/", "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Lael-Collins1.jpg", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-04T23:38:35+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-04T23:46:01+00:00"}, "type": "article"}, "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Lael-Collins1.jpg", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ed1c24", "datePublished": "2015-05-04T23:38:35+00:00", "fb": {"app_id": 164157850314499, "pages": 71179904752}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/assets/0cec37/dist/images/logos/inq-win.png", "keywords": "buffalo bills,buffalo bills rumors,la\\'el collins,la\\'el collins buffalo bills,football", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "y_key": "f282393706a5fd85", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Lael-Collins1.jpg", "height": 409, "width": 670}, "site": "@theinquisitr", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "The Buffalo Bills are rumored to be trying to land one of the most talented, but also controversial, players to come out of the college ranks, with coach Rex"}, "viewport": "width=980"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce399\"", "article_summary": "On Monday, Bills coach Rex Ryan met with La\u2019el Collins for dinner in Baton Rouge.\nSigning La\u2019el Collins would not be entirely out of character for the new Buffalo Bills.\nUnder Rex Ryan, the team has taken a number of chances on players with previous character concerns.\nThe Buffalo Bills are rumored to be trying to land one of the most talented, but also controversial, players to come out of the college ranks, with coach Rex Ryan reportedly flying to Baton Rouge to meet with former LSU lineman La\u2019el Collins.\nLa\u2019el Collins tried to avoid the NFL Draft, with his agent trying to have La\u2019el pulled so he could re-enter next year, when the investigation would presumably be completed."}
