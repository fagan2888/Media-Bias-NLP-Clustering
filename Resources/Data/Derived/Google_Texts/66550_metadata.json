Clueless, I stuck them in some soil and waited months before a tiny green spear popped out of the little pot.\n\nIn the decades since, that now 5-foot-tall plant has been dragged from the Twin Cities to rural Minnesota, North Dakota, back to the Twin Cities and to Connecticut before it returned to Minneapolis to stay. It\u2019s proof that ignorance is no barrier to growing tropical plants in cold climates year-round.\n\nThat said, having a plant survive and having it thrive are different things. My bird of paradise never flowered until I began setting it outside in a protected sunny spot during the summer. Now, I get four or five exotic blooms on the plant between February and May each year.\n\nWintering over tropical plants indoors means offering just enough care \u2014 or sometimes neglect \u2014 to nurse them through the chilly months so they can burst into full glory again the next summer.\n\nIndoor habitat\n\nBird of paradise\n\nTropical hibiscus, jasmine, bougainvillea and small citrus trees will do quite well indoors if they\u2019re in a bright spot where temperatures are at least 60 degrees. All of these plants need a gradual transition to the reduced light of the indoors. Water sparingly and don\u2019t fertilize \u2014 the plants want to rest during the short days of winter.\n\nMake sure you\u2019ve checked the plants for pests before moving them indoors. It\u2019s a good idea to isolate outdoor plants in a basement or other secluded spot for a few days, washing both sides of the leaves with a weak solution of dish soap in warm water before moving them to their winter home.\n\nDon\u2019t be surprised if leaves yellow and drop. Hibiscus often do this. Prune the plant back, and it will bounce back in the spring when the days get longer. Watch the plant carefully for signs of aphids, white fly and scale, which may pop up suddenly even after the plants have been inside for a while.\n\nOne thing to remember is that if you intend to winter over a tropical plant, make sure it stays in a pot that\u2019s small enough to easily move inside. When it\u2019s growing outside, you can bury the entire pot in the ground or in a larger pot as part of a group planting.\n\nI was reminded of this lesson last year when I bought a beautiful banana plant with purple stippling on its leaves, unpotted it and added it as an accent in a big outdoor pot. The plant tripled in size over the summer and, as I feared, by the fall it was impossible to remove the plant from the pot intact.\n\nHad I kept the banana in its own pot, I could have overwintered it in a cold, dark basement room where it would have gone dormant, and I could have repotted it in the spring for another summer of growth.\n\nThis page at Gardener\u2019s Supply Co. answers many questions about overwintering tropical plants:\n\ngardeners.com/how-to/how-to-overwinter-tender-plants/5019.html\n\nWorth the fuss?\n\nSometimes the fuss of wintering over a tropical plant just isn\u2019t worth it. After many years of spotty results with a sulky blue agapanthus, I gave it to a friend who was willing to invest more time in it than I was.\n\nI also have a lemon tree that flowers in the spring but pouts for much of the summer. I don\u2019t have a good spot in the house that\u2019s both sunny and warm in the winter, and if it doesn\u2019t bear fruit soon, I\u2019ll give that away, too.\n\nAs for the bird of paradise I received so many years ago, the plant means too much to me to be dumped; during winter it is perfectly happy growing under a shop light for a few months in my chilly basement.\n\nTo prevent it from growing too big and heavy for me to lug up and down the basement stairs each spring and fall, I divide its fat root ball with an ax every few years. The divisions go to friends and acquaintances.\n\nA couple of years ago, two of the divisions headed south to Florida, where another Master Gardener gave the plants to her daughter. I smile thinking that those little seeds I planted decades ago in a pot on my bedroom window sill in Bloomington have spawned descendants that are scattered around the country.\n\nI won\u2019t be giving up that plant anytime soon.\n\nMary Jane Smetanka is a Minneapolis freelance writer and Master Gardener.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "Tropical species can survive, even thrive, year-round \u2013 with a little know-how.", "title": "How to keep tropical plants alive, even thriving, during a Minnesota winter", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/how-to-keep-tropical-plants-alive-even-thriving-during-a-minnesota-winter/364649271/", "image": {"url": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_145226988453553.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "width": 1200, "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_145226988453553.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "twitter": {"description": "Tropical species can survive, even thrive, year-round \u2013 with a little know-how.", "title": "How to keep tropical plants alive, even thriving, during a Minnesota winter", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/how-to-keep-tropical-plants-alive-even-thriving-during-a-minnesota-winter/364649271/", "image": {"src": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_145226988453553.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_145226988453553.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "description": "Tropical species can survive, even thrive, year-round \u2013 with a little know-how."}, "article_summary": "It\u2019s proof that ignorance is no barrier to growing tropical plants in cold climates year-round.\nSometimes the fuss of wintering over a tropical plant just isn\u2019t worth it.\nWintering over tropical plants indoors means offering just enough care \u2014 or sometimes neglect \u2014 to nurse them through the chilly months so they can burst into full glory again the next summer.\nOne thing to remember is that if you intend to winter over a tropical plant, make sure it stays in a pot that\u2019s small enough to easily move inside.\nWater sparingly and don\u2019t fertilize \u2014 the plants want to rest during the short days of winter."}
