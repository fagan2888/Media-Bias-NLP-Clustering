Madison - Freshman Alec Ingold has been moved to tailback from inside linebacker, according to Wisconsin officials.

It is unclear whether he will play Saturday against Troy.



Ingold, 6 feet 2 inches and 237 pounds, was a dual-threat quarterback at Bay Port High School and as a senior was named the state player of the year by The Associated Press.



Ingold averaged 178.8 rushing yards per game as a senior. He rushed for a total of 4,208 yards and 61 touchdowns in 34 games at Bay Port.



UW’s defensive coaches are comfortable with junior Leon Jacobs, redshirt freshman T.J. Edwards, freshman Chris Orr and redshirt freshman Ryan Connelly as the top four inside linebackers.



The Badgers are thin at tailback, however.



With Corey Clement (groin) out, UW’s top three tailbacks Saturday were redshirt junior Dare Ogunbowale and redshirt freshmen Taiwan Deal and Caleb Kinlaw.
