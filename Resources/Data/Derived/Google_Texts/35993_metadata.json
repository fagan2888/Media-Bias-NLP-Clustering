They were concerned about the effect of the moratorium and were thinking of consulting an attorney to proceed further on this issue. They were also thinking of still going forward with the requisite paperwork for Lord Hanuman statue to be placed in the Capitol grounds, Zed added.\n\nZed further said that Christian, Buddhist, Jewish and Baha\u2019i leaders; United Church of Christ pastor Richard L. Smith, Buddhist priest Jikai\u2019 Phil Bryan, Jewish Rabbi ElizaBeth Webb Beyer and Baha\u2019i teacher Mary Jo Adams respectively; had already backed the proposed bid of Hindus of erecting a statue of Lord Hanuman in Oklahoma State Capitol grounds.\n\nRajan Zed pointed out that besides honoring the Hindus living in Oklahoma, this Lord Hanuman statue, which they planned to make big and weather-proof, would raise awareness of Oklahomans about Hinduism.\n\nHindus greatly revere and worship Lord Hanuman, who is known for incredible strength and was a perfect grammarian. Moksh (liberation) is the ultimate goal of Hinduism.\n\nOklahoma State Capitol Preservation Commission, based in Oklahoma City, has 15 members, including Thompson, who is Senior Policy Advisor in Oklahoma Senate; and Louis Trost is Vice Chair. Created in 1982 to plan and supervise the preservation and restoration of the interior and exterior of the Oklahoma State Capitol building, it also controls the display of objects in public areas of the State Capitol building.\n\nMary Fallin is the Governor of Oklahoma, also known as Sooner State, which Lonely Planet describes as \u201ca place with deep Native American significance\u201d. Over 25 Native American languages are reportedly spoken in Oklahoma.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hindu community share their disappointment regarding the decision to implement a moratorium on monuments on the capitol grounds", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "North Dallas Gazette", "description": "Hindu community share their disappointment regarding the decision to implement a moratorium on monuments on the capitol grounds", "title": "Hindus disappointed about Oklahoma Capitol monuments moratorium", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 3034, "identifier": "http://northdallasgazette.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Rajan-Zed-5.jpg", "height": 3808}, "updated_time": "2013-12-22T11:41:48-05:00", "url": "http://northdallasgazette.com/2013/12/22/hindus-disappointed-about-oklahoma-capitol-monuments-moratorium/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Hindu community share their disappointment regarding the decision to implement a moratorium on monuments on the capitol grounds", "creator": "@NDGEditor", "image": "http://northdallasgazette.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Rajan-Zed-5.jpg", "title": "Hindus disappointed about Oklahoma Capitol monuments moratorium", "site": "@NDGEditor", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1691728531040177}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/NorthDallasGazette/?fref=ts", "section": "Latest News", "published_time": "2013-12-22T13:36:40-05:00", "modified_time": "2013-12-22T11:41:48-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda9ae\"", "article_summary": "Hindus are heartbroken over the reported declaration of Oklahoma State Capitol Preservation Commission of moratorium on erecting new monuments on Oklahoma Capitol grounds.\nAccording to reports, Oklahoma State Capitol Preservation Commission, in its meeting on December 19, declared a moratorium on erecting new monuments on Capitol grounds.\nOklahoma State Capitol Preservation Commission, based in Oklahoma City, has 15 members, including Thompson, who is Senior Policy Advisor in Oklahoma Senate; and Louis Trost is Vice Chair.\nCreated in 1982 to plan and supervise the preservation and restoration of the interior and exterior of the Oklahoma State Capitol building, it also controls the display of objects in public areas of the State Capitol building.\nUniversal Society of Hinduism President Rajan Zed, in an email to Commission Chair Trait Thompson on December nine, had expressed desire to erect Lord Hanuman statue in Oklahoma State Capitol grounds."}
