As many grants are contingent on performance, Health Center Partners is committed to continuing to assist its members in improving quality, patient-centered care and fiscal efficiency.\"\n\nGrant opportunities for Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) in the 2016 Fiscal Year include:\n\n$265 Million \u2013 Health Infrastructure Investment Program\n\n\u2013 Health Infrastructure Investment Program $100 Million \u2013 Quality Improvement Awards\n\n\u2013 Quality Improvement Awards $150 Million \u2013 Oral Health Service Expansion\n\n\u2013 Oral Health Service Expansion $33 Million \u2013 Health Center Controlled Networks\n\n\"Community health centers that are part of a network typically perform better than their counterparts due to the invaluable resources, collaboration and information exchange offered by such consortia,\" said Bowers. \"As we continue to shift to value-based care, health centers that demonstrate improved patient outcomes, community engagement and operational efficiency will be better positioned to receive federal funding. I applaud the regional consortia in Southern California for hosting this educational event and for continuing to connect member centers with the support structure needed for success.\"\n\nCommunity health centers provide high quality preventive and primary health care, including dental and behavioral health services, to predominantly low income and underserved patients.

In Southern California, Health Center Partners has 17 member health centers, Community Clinic Association of Los Angeles County has 58 members and The Coalition of Orange County Community Health Centers has 26 members. Together the three consortia serve more than 2.4 million patients each year.\n\nFor more information on Health Center Partners, please visit www.hcpsocal.org.\n\nAbout Health Center Partners\n\nHealth Center Partners (formerly Council of Community Clinics) and its subsidiaries serve as the nexus for its members and partners to transform primary care through the power of innovation and collaboration.
