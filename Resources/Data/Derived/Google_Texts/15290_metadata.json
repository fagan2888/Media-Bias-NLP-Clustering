Violence in our schools should not be fodder for political campaigns.\u201d\n\nJen Walmer, the Colorado state director for Democrats for Education Reform, which through an affiliated group has spent more than $200,000 on direct mail, radio and other media in the contested state board races, sees it differently.\n\n\u201cThe imagery in the mailer represents the shade of red that partisan Marcia Neal is painting our classrooms,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI apologize if anyone thought otherwise, but clearly the intent was to show the red hue of partisanship brought on by Marcia Neal.\u201d\n\nWalmer said it is important to communicate to voters the difference between the candidates, something she said can be difficult for the candidates themselves in a loud election season in a sprawling district.\n\nHer group portrays Roman, a retired superintendent and charter school administrator from Pueblo, as \u201ca seasoned educator who focuses on kids and giving all of Colorado students access to a high-quality education.\u201d She said Neal has become more partisan, pointing to language on her web site underscoring her focus on ensuring her party maintains board control.\n\nBefore we received a copy of the red-hued mailer, Walmer provided a kinder, gentler, direct mail piece with pencils, a globe and excerpts of newspaper endorsements of Roman (including one from Neal\u2019s hometown paper, The Grand Junction Dail Sentinel).\n\nNotably, there is no Republican equivalent independent group spending money in the state Board of Education races.\n\nThe conservative group Americans for Prosperity has waded into local school district races before, including in Douglas County. But the group has focused heavily on vouchers, not much of an issue in the state board race.\n\nVan Schoales, CEO of the pro-education reform group A+ Denver, cited the shifting positions of Republicans \u2013 many of whom have been aligned with reform-minded Democrats in the past \u2013 on standards, testing and other issues.\n\n\u201cHistorically, Republicans have had an orientation towards having more choice, and also having greater accountability for school performance \u2013 the No Child Left Behind, Jed and George Bush approach,\u201d said Schoales, who formerly worked for DFER. \u201cRecently, there\u2019s been a move to try to roll back these things arguing it\u2019s a federal overreach. Some folks are really struggling with what is more important, accountability for performance or local control.\u201d\n\nIn an e-mail, Neal said she heard a radio ad that represented the same theme as the red-hued mailer.\n\n\u201cThese are really ugly ads,\u201d she said. \u201cThe reader that compared them to blood was right. Being portrayed as an evil doer that wants to harms kids is unsettling \u2026 In my last race we had a very spirited ongoing discussion. But we both respected one another.\u201d\n\nWhat say you?
