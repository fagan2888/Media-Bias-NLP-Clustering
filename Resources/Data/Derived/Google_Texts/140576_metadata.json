And sometimes it can seem to backfire, increasing the pressure on those it is meant to help.\n\nWith gay pride parades taking place in many cities across the world this weekend, the U.S. role will be more visible than ever. Diplomats will take part in parades and some embassies will fly the rainbow flag along with the Stars and Stripes.\n\nThe United States sent five openly gay ambassadors abroad last year, with a sixth nominee, to Vietnam, now awaiting Senate confirmation. American diplomats are working to support gay rights in countries such as Poland, where prejudice remains deep, and to oppose violence and other abuse in countries like Nigeria and Russia, where gays face life-threatening risks.\n\n\u201cIt is incredible. I am amazed by what the U.S. is doing to help us,\u201d said Mariusz Kurc, the editor of a Polish gay advocacy magazine, Replika, which has received some U.S. funding and other help. \u201cWe are used to struggling and not finding any support.\u201d\n\nFormer President George W. Bush supported AIDS prevention efforts globally, but it was the Obama administration that launched the push to make lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights an international issue. The watershed moment came in December 2011, when then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton went to the United Nations in Geneva and proclaimed LGBT rights \u201cone of the remaining human rights challenges of our time.\u201d\n\nSince then, embassies have been opening their doors to gay rights activists, hosting events and supporting local advocacy work. The State Department has since spent $12 million on the efforts in over 50 countries through the Global Equality Fund, an initiative launched to fund the new work.\n\nJust weeks after the Supreme Court struck down parts of the Defense of Marriage Act last June, consular posts also began issuing immigrant visas to the same-sex spouses of gay Americans.\n\nOne beneficiary was Jake Lees, a 27-year-old Englishman who had been forced to spend long periods apart from his American partner, Austin Armacost, since they met six years ago. In May Lees was issued a fiance visa at the U.S. Embassy in London. The couple married two weeks ago and are now starting a new life together in Franklin, Indiana, as they wait for Lees\u2019 green card.\n\n\u201cI felt like the officers at the embassy treated us the way they would treat a heterosexual couple,\u201d said Armacost, a 26-year-old fitness and nutrition instructor. \u201cIt\u2019s a mind-boggling change after gay couples were treated like legal strangers for the first three centuries of our country\u2019s history.\u201d\n\nSome conservative American groups are outraged by the policy. Brian Brown, president of the National Organization for Marriage, calls it \u201ca slap in the face to the majority of Americans,\u201d given that American voters have rejected same-sex marriage in a number of state referendums.\n\n\u201cThis is taking a flawed view of what it means to be a human being \u2014 male and female \u2014 and trying to impose that on countries throughout the world,\u201d Brown said. \u201cThe administration would like people to believe that this is simply \u2018live and let live.\u2019 No, this is coercion in its worst possible form.\u201d\n\nThe American efforts are tailored to local conditions, said Scott Busby, the deputy assistant secretary for the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor at the State Department. Ambassadors can decide individually whether to hoist the rainbow flag, as embassies in Tel Aviv, London and Prague have done, or show support in other ways.", "article_metadata": {"description": "US takes gay rights global, despite unsure welcome", "title": "US takes gay rights global, despite unsure welcome", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "US takes gay rights global, despite unsure welcome", "title": "US takes gay rights global, despite unsure welcome", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/06/28/us_takes_gay_rights_global_despite_unsure_welcome/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/global-gay-rights.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "US takes gay rights global, despite unsure welcome", "title": "US takes gay rights global, despite unsure welcome", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/global-gay-rights.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Vanessa Gera", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: From the Wires, NewsWARSAW, Poland (AP) \u2014 President Barack Obama\u2019s administration has taken the U.S. gay rights revolution global, using American embassies across the world as outposts in a struggle that still hasn\u2019t been won at home.\nWith gay pride parades taking place in many cities across the world this weekend, the U.S. role will be more visible than ever.\nThe United States sent five openly gay ambassadors abroad last year, with a sixth nominee, to Vietnam, now awaiting Senate confirmation.\nAmerican diplomats are working to support gay rights in countries such as Poland, where prejudice remains deep, and to oppose violence and other abuse in countries like Nigeria and Russia, where gays face life-threatening risks.\nDiplomats will take part in parades and some embassies will fly the rainbow flag along with the Stars and Stripes."}
