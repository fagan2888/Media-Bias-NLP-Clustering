Thad Cochran of Mississippi, one of the longest-serving Republican senators, announced Friday that he will run for re-election next year.\n\nThe senator first shared the news in an interview with Gannet.\n\nThe move sets up a contentious re-election fight between Cochran and conservative groups that have made him a prime target in the Republican primary.
