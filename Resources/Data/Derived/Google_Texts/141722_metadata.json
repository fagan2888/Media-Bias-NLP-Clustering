Many residents say they were too damaged to live in.\n\nAs investigators dig for more answers, Oklahoma insurance department commissioner John Doak toured those homes Wednesday afternoon.\n\nThe commissioner got a firsthand look at all the damage, while many have begun to pick up the pieces and wonder where to go next.\n\nFor those that lost nearly everything in explosion on Whispering Hollow Drive. A visit from state insurance commissioner John Doak was a welcomed sight.\n\nThe house erupted into flames after something sparked an explosion while Oklahoma Natural Gas workers were trying to find a leak early Saturday morning.\n\nWednesday, the commissioner called the damage catastrophic and despite his title his focus is more about people than policies.\n\nThe official word on what happened won't be for some time. ONG said they are still working to understand what went wrong and who, if anyone, is to blame.\n\nA spokesperson explained what they know so far in a statement saying, \"Natural gas escaped from the main and migrated under the residence. The gas was then ignited by an unknown source.\"\n\nBut Doak said it\u2019s those unknowns in life that make having insurance so important.\n\nONG says it will have its investigation finished and ready for release by February.\n\n1/6/16 Related Story: ONG Releases Preliminary Results Of Investigation Into NW OKC House Explosion", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "An Oklahoma insurance commissioner is touring the wreckage of a house that exploded last Saturday in NW Oklahoma City.", "author": "News9.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.news9.com/story/30901501/insurance-commissioner-walks-through-wreckage-of-nw-okc-house-explosion", "image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/9592654_G.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "An Oklahoma insurance commissioner is touring the wreckage of a house that exploded last Saturday in NW Oklahoma City.", "title": "Insurance Commissioner Walks Through Wreckage Of NW OKC House Explosion"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/9592654_G.jpg", "description": "An Oklahoma insurance commissioner is touring the wreckage of a house that exploded last Saturday in NW Oklahoma City.", "card": "summary", "title": "Insurance Commissioner Walks Through Wreckage Of NW OKC House Explosion"}, "wnreadableurl": "insurance-commissioner-walks-through-wreckage-of-nw-okc-house-explosion", "ROBOTS": "index,follow,noarchive", "owner": "KWTV", "fb": {"app_id": 538140636230283}, "date": "2016/01/06", "KEYWORDS": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,newsok,channel 9,channel nine,news 9,television,this morning,live radar,kwtv,sports,video,live streaming,interactive", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS24", "verify-v1": "d5ZN+GNiazjgWlnr3WHikwraMvFljdUSLMgex4CGnc8=", "news_keywords": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,newsok,channel 9,channel nine,news 9,television,this morning,live radar,kwtv,sports,video,live streaming,interactive"}, "article_summary": "As investigators dig for more answers, Oklahoma insurance department commissioner John Doak toured those homes Wednesday afternoon.\nA visit from state insurance commissioner John Doak was a welcomed sight.\nThe house erupted into flames after something sparked an explosion while Oklahoma Natural Gas workers were trying to find a leak early Saturday morning.\nA spokesperson explained what they know so far in a statement saying, \"Natural gas escaped from the main and migrated under the residence.\n1/6/16 Related Story: ONG Releases Preliminary Results Of Investigation Into NW OKC House Explosion"}
