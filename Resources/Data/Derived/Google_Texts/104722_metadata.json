Michael Bowie said Saturday at the MLK Community Center in South Dallas. \u201cWe pray that we can stand in the gap for those who don\u2019t have a voice.\u201d\n\nThe pastor of St. Luke Community United Methodist Church was among about 40 people who gathered near Fair Park to pay their respects to the civil rights leader on the anniversary of his assassination in Memphis.\n\nPeople who attended were given yellow ribbons to signify friendship and solidarity, and members of Madison High School\u2019s JROTC placed a yellow-and-white wreath at the community center\u2019s statue of King.\n\nThe service included prayers for health, employment, education and social justice.\n\nThe Rev. Joyce Campbell of Be Covered Texas, a grassroots campaign that helps educate people about health care, said King believed that access to medical services was one of the biggest issues for minorities. She said it remains a concern for many.\n\nShe praised the Affordable Care Act, calling it \u201cthe most important civil rights milestone since the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, my brothers and sisters,\u201d she told the cheering audience, \u201cchange has come, but there\u2019s still work to do.\u201d\n\nBefore the service honoring King, the MLK center had a ribbon-cutting ceremony to mark the opening of a Little Free Library at Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard and Jeffries Street.\n\nPatrick Jackson, the MLK center\u2019s manager, said that it had taken nearly a year to open the library but that it already has distributed more than 200 books since it was installed earlier in the week.\n\n\u201cThe education level is very, very low in our area,\u201d he said. \u201cThis gives them a chance to have reading [material] without going into the library.\u201d\n\nOra Hankins, manager of the Dallas Public Library\u2019s MLK branch, also praised the Little Free Library.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be an asset to the community,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is meant to bring the community together, and I\u2019m sure it will.\u201d\n\nFollow Charles Scudder on Twitter at @cscudder.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\u201cWe know Dr. King\u2019s dream was a prophetic dream, but we believe his dream is still alive,\u201d the Rev.
