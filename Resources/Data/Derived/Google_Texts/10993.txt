Ellinwood police say a man from Chase, Kansas was killed after overturning his truck late Friday night.

Just after 2 a.m., investigators say 63 year-old Philip Bryant was traveling Eastbound in the 1100 Block of East Barton County Road, when he lost control of the truck.

Bryant was the only occupant of the vehicle and was pronounced dead on the scene.

The Barton County Sheriff's Department is still investigating if alcohol was a contributing factor.
