In the latter case, is that really what he said during his Wednesday appearance on Morning Joe?\n\nIn both cases, Chuck Todd is the ripest of targets for media critics on both political poles. For conservatives, he\u2019s a two-birds representative of the mainstream, objective press that they\u2019re always trying to discredit as actually a stealth liberal cabal, and an avenue to attack the dreaded MSNBC. For liberals, Chuck is typical of the \u201cBeltway Villager\u201d class that reduces weighty policy matters to insular political considerations.\n\nChuck became the focal point of criticism over reporting, by colleague Richard Esposito, that falsely named the Washington Navy Yard shooter. He retweeted Esposito\u2019s scoop, then assisted in retracting it, providing extensive detail. Esposito is wide open to the criticism that he should have applied a high bar to reporting information with so much potential for harm, but Chuck Todd\u2019s role in this was minimal, and arguably more helpful than not. Nobody\u2019s ever heard of Richard Esposito, though, so Chuck got to sit in the barrel.\n\nOn Wednesday morning\u2019s Morning Joe, Todd attracted the attention of liberal critics when, as TPM puts it, he suggested that It\u2019s Not Media\u2019s Job To Correct GOP\u2019s Obamacare Falsehoods. But is that a fair reading of what Chuck said? Not according to him. In response to the criticism, Chuck tweeted \u201cSomebody decided to troll w/mislding headline: point I actually made was folks shouldn\u2019t expect media to do job WH has FAILED to do re: ACA.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s a slightly longer version of the exchange in question, which begins with Todd challenging the Villager-approved talking point that the President is actually the one who\u2019s threatening to blow up the government. He then talks extensively about the \u201cmillion disasters\u201d in the political process of health care reform, including some that liberals would quickly agree with.\n\nThe key exchange is between Todd and former Governor Ed Rendell (D-PA) in which Rendell talks about the misinformation that has proliferated on the Affordable Care Act. \u201cI think the biggest problem with Obamacare, it\u2019s not a perfect bill by any means, was the messaging,\u201d Rendell says. \u201cIf you took ten people from different parts of the country who say they\u2019re against the bill, and sat them down, I\u2019d love to have ten minutes with them and say, \u2018Tell me why you are against the bill.\u2019 If they told you anything, it would be stuff that\u2019s incorrect.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut more importantly, it would be stuff that Republicans have successfully messaged against it,\u201d Todd says. \u201cThey don\u2019t repeat the other stuff because they haven\u2019t even heard the Democratic message. What I always love is people who say, \u2018Well, it\u2019s you folks\u2019 fault in the media.\u2019 No, it\u2019s the President of the United States\u2019 fault for not selling it.\u201d\n\nPlease enable Javascript to watch.\n\nA fair reading of what Chuck said, without endorsing it, is that it\u2019s not the media\u2019s job to promote Democratic messaging. That\u2019s not the same thing as saying they have no duty to correct falsehoods, which is an interpretation by extension. In context, he\u2019s clearly talking about the political process around Obamacare, and not the substance of it.\n\nWhat I find problematic about this exchange is the pivot that Todd uses to get to the politics. When Rendell says people are being misinformed, Chuck says \u201cBut more importantly, it would be stuff that Republicans have successfully messaged against it.\u201d\n\nPerhaps he meant more important in terms of the outcome, but it should matter more, to the news media, if the messaging, Democratic or Republican, is true. In fits and starts, the media has provided context for the policy, but almost always within the horse race frame of who is \u201cwinning\u201d the messaging war. For example, news outlets often (but not always) point out that almost every part of the Affordable Care Act is wildly popular, except for the individual mandate. Everyone loves to eat dinner, but nobody likes to pay the check. Yet even with that knowledge, as demonstrated in the segment above, news personalities routinely refer to the law as \u201cunpopular.\u201d That\u2019s a defensible bit of semantics, but an abdication of the duty to provide context, in the public\u2019s interest.\n\n(h/t TPM)\n\n[photo via screengrab]", "article_metadata": {"description": "NBC News Political Director and Chief White House Correspondent Chuck Todd has taken a beating from both sides of the political spectrum this week, first for", "generator": "WordPress 2016.21", "og": {"image": "http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/chuck.jpg", "title": "Did Chuck Todd Really Say Media Not Responsible to Correct Obamacare \u2018Falsehoods?\u2019"}, "twitter": {"description": "NBC News Political Director and Chief White House Correspondent Chuck Todd has taken a beating from both sides of the political spectrum this week, first for the crime of retweeting, then transparently and professionally retracting, a colleague's reporting, and now, for allegedly disavowing the media's role in fact-checking Republican falsehoods about Obamacare.
