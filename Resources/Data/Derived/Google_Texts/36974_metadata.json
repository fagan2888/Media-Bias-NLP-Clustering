What recent treatise on the inner workings of public policy has garnered that sort of description? Didn\u2019t the term \u201cthriller\u201d belong to writers like Paula Hawkins, Dean Koontz, Gillian Flynn and James Patterson? But Brill\u2019s meticulous narrative of how Obamacare was constructed is a public-policy thriller, and the suspense he writes about is how the law was brought from broth to soup.\n\nWhile Brill is hardly a public-policy advocate (he\u2019s a long time investigative reporter), he does laud the president\u2019s herculean effort to give millions of Americans access to affordable health care. He just doesn\u2019t believe that any of the big \u201cplayers\u201d in health care \u2013 hospitals, device makers, insurance companies or pharmaceuticals \u2013 felt a pinch of economic pain, and he sees America\u2019s health care system still as an old \u201cjalopy\u201d financially out of control and enriching special interests.\n\nThe seed for the book was spawned in a 24,000-word article in TIME magazine in April 2013. A year later, while reporting on the rollout of the ACA, Brill was diagnosed with an aortic aneurysm \u2013 flipping the story and putting investigative reporter onto the operating table as a very real person needing cardiac surgery.\n\nAs he told NPR\u2019s Terry Gross:\n\nAt that moment I wasn\u2019t worried about costs; I wasn\u2019t worried about a cost-benefit analysis of this drug or this medical device; I wasn\u2019t worried about health-care policy. It drove home to me the reality that in addition to being a tough political issue because of all of the money involved, health care is a toxic political issue because of all of the fear and emotion involved.\n\nAt the end of my conversation I asked Brill if there was one question he\u2019d been surprised that he\u2019d not been asked during his media blitz, which began with a rollout by Lesley Stahl on CBS\u2019 6o Minutes. \u201cYes,\u201d he said, \u201cyou just touched on it.\u201d How would his book had been different if he\u2019d not had an aortic aneurism, a cardiac operation and become a patient? So how would Chapter One have begun?\n\nI hope you\u2019ll listen to my latest 1:2:1 podcast to hear what he has to say.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "steven bill,america\\'s bitter pill,health care policy,affordable care act,health care costs,health policy,medicine,news home", "og": {"image": "http://scopeblog.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Bitter-Pill.jpg"}, "description": "A New York Times\u00a0review called Steven Brill's book, America's Bitter Pill,\u00a0\"a thriller.\" Brill's tome on the building of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), aka", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc238\"", "article_summary": "ShareA New York Times review called Steven Brill\u2019s book, America\u2019s Bitter Pill, \u201ca thriller.\u201d Brill\u2019s tome on the building of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), aka Obamacare, \u201ca thriller?\u201d I thought.\nAs he told NPR\u2019s Terry Gross:At that moment I wasn\u2019t worried about costs; I wasn\u2019t worried about a cost-benefit analysis of this drug or this medical device; I wasn\u2019t worried about health-care policy.\nHe just doesn\u2019t believe that any of the big \u201cplayers\u201d in health care \u2013 hospitals, device makers, insurance companies or pharmaceuticals \u2013 felt a pinch of economic pain, and he sees America\u2019s health care system still as an old \u201cjalopy\u201d financially out of control and enriching special interests.\nWhile Brill is hardly a public-policy advocate (he\u2019s a long time investigative reporter), he does laud the president\u2019s herculean effort to give millions of Americans access to affordable health care.\nBut Brill\u2019s meticulous narrative of how Obamacare was constructed is a public-policy thriller, and the suspense he writes about is how the law was brought from broth to soup."}
