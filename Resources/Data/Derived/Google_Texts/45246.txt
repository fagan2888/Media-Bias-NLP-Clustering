Congressman Todd Young, R-Indiana 9th, officially kicked off his U.S. Senate campaign at an event held just outside of Louisville on Saturday, saying his career in the Marines and representing Indiana’s 9th District perfectly positions him to bring responsible, conservative leadership to the Senate.

Young is seeking to replace outgoing Senator Dan Coats, R-Indiana, who announced his retirement earlier this year.

Young spent much of his kickoff event, held at an American Legion in Sellersburg, talking about his background – from growing up the son of a business owner and registered nurse to his military service to his law career in southern Indiana.

He says those experiences instilled in him values that are reflected in his record in Congress.

“I’m a pro-life, pro-gun Marine that wants to repeal and replace Obamacare,” he said to a cheering crowd.

Young referred often to his time as a Marine. He says he’s running for Senate in part because, as he puts it, “the world is a dangerous place.”

“It only gets more dangerous if America turns her back on the world – diplomatically, economically, and yes militarily as well. We have to stay smartly and selectively engaged in the world and we need more Unites States senators who understand this basic principle,” he said.

The 9th district congressman joins a GOP primary race that will pit him against 3rd District Congressman Marlin Stutzman and former State Party Chair Eric Holcomb.

Candidates are already lining up to vie for Young’s Congressional seat, including Indiana Attorney General Greg Zoeller and State Sen. Erin Houchin.
