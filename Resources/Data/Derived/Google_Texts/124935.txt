Remember the penalty for not following the "individual mandate" to purchase health insurance under Obamacare? According to Affordable Care Act critics, it was an example of government overreach or even tyranny; according to the Supreme Court (barely), it was an acceptably constitutional requirement of the law. As the Wall Street Journal reports today based on research from the Congressional Budget Office and Joint Committee on Taxation, the penalty is also not something that many Americans will actually end up paying by the time the rule takes full effect in 2016â€”even though, as of now, 30 million people remain uninsured.
