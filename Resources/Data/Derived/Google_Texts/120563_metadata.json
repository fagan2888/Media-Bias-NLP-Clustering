What is noticeably lacking in the news coverage about this primarily evangelical Christian response to what\u2019s seen as an over-sexualized culture is a more nuanced understanding of how these pledges work. Namely, how do the teens stay true to their vows and what happens after marriage?\n\nStudying a small group of young evangelical Christian men, Sarah Diefendorf, a sociology graduate student at the University of Washington, found that support groups and open discussions about sex with trusted companions were key in helping the men maintain their pledge during their pre-marital years. However, once these men entered the marriage bed, they began to face real trouble.\n\n\u201cPeople think that evangelical support groups are just about suppressing men\u2019s natural urges, but really they are caring, supportive and safe spaces that allow men to have a remarkably open and frank discussion about sexual desire,\u201d Diefendorf stated in a press release. She presented her findings at the 109th annual meeting of the American Sociological Association in San Francisco on Sunday.\n\nDiefendorf began her study in 2008, when she began attending support group meetings for young men in their late teens and early 20s, who had pledged to remain virgins until marriage. Her particular group was affiliated with a nondenominational evangelical megachurch attended by about 14,000 worshippers each Sunday in the southwest United States. Over the course of a year, Diefendorf also conducted one-on-one interviews and focus-group meetings with the men.\n\nDuring the group meetings, the men spoke of sex as a \u201csacred\u201d gift from God intended for wedded couples only, and also as a \u201cbeastly\u201d occurrence if it happened outside of marriage. \u201cTo maintain this gift from God, they believe that they must control sex before marriage,\u201d Diefendorf explained. Many of the men spoke of how they struggled with the many threats to their virginity commitment, including pornography, yet also masturbation, which some considered \u201cas destructive.\u201d\n\nDiefendorf found discussion in a support group was only one way for the young men to explore their sexual urges. Each also worked with an \u201caccountability partner\u201d to help control his behavior. One of the men, for instance, told Diefendorf that his accountability partner sent him text messages every night: \u201cAre you behaving?\u201d Some used other tech tools, such as software that would track the websites they visited, information they later shared with their accountability partners.\n\nA few years later, in 2011 and 2012, Diefendorf returned to the men having learned that 14 were now married. She wanted to know how the men\u2019s views of sex and masculinity had changed since marriage. As taboo as sexual activity was before marriage, Diefendorf soon discovered, talking about sex now that they were married was equally taboo, as it was seen as disrespecting their wives. \u201cAfter marriage, the church culture assumes that couples become each other\u2019s support, regardless of the issue at hand,\u201d Diefendorf said. \u201cThere\u2019s little support in figuring out sexuality in married life, and these men don\u2019t know how to talk to their wives about it.\u201d One of the men told Diefendorf, \u201cFor me to come home from work and say, \u2018hey, did you like it last time?\u2019 I mean that would be \u2014 that would be such a weird question for me to ask.\u201d\n\nThe newlyweds had discovered the so-called beastly elements of sex \u2014 temptations by pornography and extramarital affairs \u2014 do not disappear with marriage. The men wished for more guidance from the church, and one said he\u2019d cheer if his pastor decided to talk more about sex. Deifendorf noted \u201cthese men have gotten so used to thinking about sex as something negative that they bring those concerns with them to the marriage bed,\u201d and once married, they \u201cstruggle to manage those concerns in the absence of the supportive community.\u201d\n\nTwo things are noticeably lacking in this small scale study. One is the attitude of women. While her study wasn\u2019t designed to address women\u2019s take on virginity pledges, Diefendorf told New Republic, \u201cThe church, and the men that I interviewed, don\u2019t believe that women would need a space to talk through these issues. They believe that men are highly sexual beings and they have \u2018natural urges\u2019 that need to be controlled, but they don\u2019t believe that women have that natural desire to be sexually active.\u201d In one case, a man told of breaking up with a woman he\u2019d dated from outside the church because she wanted to have premarital sex. He believed her desire for sex indicated she was in love with him. While this may have been the truth, Diefendorf suggested he simply may not have understood this woman to have a sexual appetite.\n\nWhile the women\u2019s perspective would add to the study, a more important missing element is a \u201ccontrol group\u201d \u2014 a comparison group of age-matched wedded men who had not taken a virginity pledge before marriage. What did they experience before and after marriage? My guess would be the absent control group of men would have faced pretty much the same level of confusion, both before and after marriage, though for different reasons. After all, the men in this study were relatively young, and for many men and women, it takes time to make sex and love and partnership work.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "virginity pledges, abstinence pledges, sexual education", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Support groups and open discussions about sex were key to helping men maintain virginity pledges during the pre-marital years, yet these men faced trouble once married.", "title": "What Married Life Is Like For Men Who Take Virginity Pledges", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/what-true-love-waits-and-other-virginity-pledge-programs-are-really-mans-perspective-299178", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/21/praying-man.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Support groups and open discussions about sex were key to helping men maintain virginity pledges during the pre-marital years, yet these men faced trouble once married.", "title": "What Married Life Is Like For Men Who Take Virginity Pledges", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/what-true-love-waits-and-other-virginity-pledge-programs-are-really-mans-perspective-299178", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/21/praying-man.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/21/praying-man.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2014-08-21T14:48:05-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-21T14:48:04-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Support groups and open discussions about sex were key to helping men maintain virginity pledges during the pre-marital years, yet these men faced trouble once married."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2443\"", "article_summary": "\u201cTo maintain this gift from God, they believe that they must control sex before marriage,\u201d Diefendorf explained.\nVirginity pledges, where teens vow to forego sex until marriage, have frequently appeared in the news since the phenomenon began in the early 1990s.\nAfter all, the men in this study were relatively young, and for many men and women, it takes time to make sex and love and partnership work.\n\u201cAfter marriage, the church culture assumes that couples become each other\u2019s support, regardless of the issue at hand,\u201d Diefendorf said.\nA few years later, in 2011 and 2012, Diefendorf returned to the men having learned that 14 were now married."}
