Sarah Kala-Meir and Tom Canning of Jerusalem Open House for Pride and Tolerance had been scheduled to speak at the gathering.\n\nThe National LGBTQ Task Force cancelled the reception amid criticism from Dean Spade, founder of the Sylvia Rivera Law Project, and others who accused A Wider Bridge of promoting Israel\u2019s LGBT rights record in an attempt to deflect attention away from its treatment of the Palestinians.\n\nThe decision to cancel the reception sparked outrage among LGBT rights advocates in Israel and in the U.S.\n\n\u201cIn reversing the decision today, we want to make it quite clear that the Creating Change Conference will always be a safe space for inclusion and dialogue for people with often widely different views,\u201d said Carey in her statement. \u201cIt was not at all our intention to censor representatives of the Jerusalem Open House or A Wider Bridge at Creating Change and I apologize that our actions left people feeling silenced.\u201d\n\nA Wider Bridge in a statement thanked Carey and the National LGBTQ Task Force for reversing their decision.\n\n\u201cWe look forward to bringing our important work, and the work of Jerusalem Open House, to Creating Change in Chicago,\u201d said A Wider Bridge. \u201cOur goal is to always engage in constructive dialogue that will further our cause, and now we can continue our important work for our worldwide community.\u201d\n\nKala-Meir, who is the executive director of the Jerusalem Open House for Pride and Tolerance, in a statement described the National LGBTQ Task Force\u2019s apology as \u201csincere.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs a home for all LGBTQ Jerusalemites, it is only natural that we find among us people from diverse backgrounds, political affiliations, ethnicity and religions,\u201d she said. \u201cWhile recognizing the sensitivities and complexities of working within a conflict situation, we try to focus on our commonality rather than our differences, and to serve everyone regardless.\u201d\n\nAnti-Defamation League CEO Jonathan A. Greenblatt also welcomed the decision to allow the reception to take place at the conference.\n\n\u201cWe are very pleased that the Task Force has reversed course and taken responsibility for their deeply misguided decision to cancel this reception,\u201d he said.\n\nSpade expressed disappointment.\n\n\u201cThis indicates that there is a lot of work still to do to build understanding and discernment within the Task Force about how Israel advocacy organizations use pinkwashing,\u201d Spade told the Washington Blade.\n\n\u201cThese events are still a victory for those who oppose pinkwashing because they have raised this conversation to national attention and are providing an opportunity for meaningful engagement in queer and trans communities about how purportedly \u2018pro-gay\u2019 propaganda works and why opposing racism, occupation and apartheid is essential to our liberation,\u201d added Spade.\n\nSpade earlier on Tuesday noted he does engage in \u201ccollaborations with Israelis\u201d that are not part of efforts backed by the Israeli government. Spade also expressed opposition to groups that \u201cpromote Israeli government funded propaganda tools, normalize occupation and apartheid by talking about \u2018gay rights in Israel\u2019 without opposing the fact that LGBT people who are Palestinian live under occupation and apartheid.\u201d\n\nThe reception will take place less than five months after Yishai Schlissel, an Orthodox Jewish man, stabbed a 16-year-old girl to death and injured five others during an attack on a Jerusalem Pride march that Jerusalem Open House for Pride and Tolerance organized. The July 30, 2015, incident took place a day before two Jewish settlers allegedly killed a Palestinian toddler and his parents on the West Bank when they set fire to their home.\n\nThe National LGBTQ Task Force earlier this month announced the cancellation of a panel at the Creating Change Conference that was to have included officials from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The advocacy group in a statement said it made the decision in response to \u201cconcerns from our community.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The National LGBTQ Task Force has reversed its decision to cancel a reception with activists from Israel at its annual conference.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Blade: Gay News, Politics, LGBT Rights", "description": "The National LGBTQ Task Force has reversed its decision to cancel a reception with activists from Israel at its annual conference.", "title": "Group reverses decision to cancel reception with Israeli activists", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 460, "identifier": "http://www.washingtonblade.com/content/files/2015/06/Rea_Carey_at_Supreme_Court_460x470_c_Washington_Blade_by_Michael_Key.jpg", "height": 470}, "updated_time": "2016-01-19T14:57:53-04:00", "url": "http://www.washingtonblade.com/2016/01/19/group-reverses-decision-to-cancel-reception-with-israeli-activists/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The National LGBTQ Task Force has reversed its decision to cancel a reception with activists from Israel at its annual conference.", "creator": "@mklavers81", "image": "http://www.washingtonblade.com/content/files/2015/06/Rea_Carey_at_Supreme_Court_460x470_c_Washington_Blade_by_Michael_Key.jpg", "title": "Group reverses decision to cancel reception with Israeli activists", "site": "@WashBlade", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 13357499221}, "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/WashingtonBlade", "section": "homepage news", "tag": "Rea Carey", "published_time": "2016-01-19T11:37:35-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-19T14:57:53-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "news_keywords": "A Wider Bridge, Anti-Defamation League, Creating Change Conference, Dean Spade, Israel, Jerusalem Open House for Pride and Tolerance, Jonathan A.
