In a sign of consumer confidence and improving economic conditions, automakers posted impressive U.S. sales gains last month. The seven percent increase marked a 15-year high for the month of February.

Amid positive news for the auto industry, Consumer Reports just published its annual list of TK top car picks for 2016 in TK categories. The 10 cars at the top of their list in each category had the highest overall score based on four variables: road test score, reliability, safety and owner satisfaction.

In order to qualify for the list, each model had to rank either at the top or near the top of its class in the road test. Both reliability and owner satisfaction are based on problems reported by subscribers through surveys. The cars that make the list also must perform well in crash or rollover tests that Consumer Reports, The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety conduct.

Only two American cars scored spots on the list this year – the Chevrolet Impala among large cars and the Ford F-150 among pickups. The rest were all foreign-made.

The Japanese brand Subaru was the only one to make the list twice, with the Impreza and Forester. The brand also ranked second on Consumer Reports’ annual brand “report card,” right behind Audi.

According to Mark Rechtin, Consumer Reports’ cars content development team leader, a few automakers were successful in making the list by redesigning old models. “This year’s Top Picks include refreshed models, like the Lexus RX, that have vaulted back to the top of their respective categories after lengthy absences,” Rechtin told CBS Detroit.
