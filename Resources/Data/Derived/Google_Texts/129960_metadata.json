A statement from the Energy Department and the National Nuclear Security Administration says the project\u2019s 120 centrifuges provided valuable data on centrifuge technology but a facility in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, shows more promise.\n\n\u201cWe have concluded that continued support from the federal government for additional data from Piketon operations has limited remaining value,\u201d the statement said.\n\nThe move affects about 235 employees at the site, according to Centrus Energy, the operator of the plant.\n\nThe news follows a warning from a company decontaminating and cleaning up the plant that a federal budget gap could mean more than 500 layoffs among its own employees, affiliated personnel and subcontractors.\n\nThose layoffs could occur around Oct. 22, but the project\u2019s director and other leaders remain hopeful they\u2019ll get funding needed to continue their current pace, which costs roughly $387 million annually, according to Fluor-BWXT Portsmouth, the main clean-up contractor.\n\nThe Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant in Piketon produced enriched uranium for defense and commercial uses until 2001. Its shutdown left behind chemicals and radioactive areas to be addressed and huge buildings to be demolished - work that is taking decades and employs about 1,800 people in a pocket of high unemployment.\n\nU.S. Sen. Rob Portman, a Cincinnati Republican, called the news a blow to Piketon and southeastern Ohio and another broken promise by the administration of President Barack Obama to support the site.\n\nU.S. Rep. Tim Ryan, a Youngstown Democrat, said the decision was disappointing.\n\n\u201cI will continue to work with the Ohio business community to do everything in our power to ensure that the Piketon facility can continue to do its important work and transition to operate commercially,\u201d Ryan said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ohio officials are criticizing an announcement by the government to halt a southern Ohio uranium enrichment project in favor of similar work being done in Tennessee.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/sep/12/feds-halt-uranium-enrichment-project-at-southern-o/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "Ohio officials are criticizing an announcement by the government to halt a southern Ohio uranium enrichment project in favor of similar work being done in Tennessee.", "title": "Feds halt uranium enrichment project at southern Ohio plant"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "description": "Ohio officials are criticizing an announcement by the government to halt a southern Ohio uranium enrichment project in favor of similar work being done in Tennessee.", "card": "summary", "title": "Feds halt uranium enrichment project at southern Ohio plant"}, "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "PIKETON, Ohio (AP) - Ohio officials are criticizing an announcement by the government to halt a southern Ohio uranium enrichment project in favor of similar work being done in Tennessee.\nThe Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant in Piketon produced enriched uranium for defense and commercial uses until 2001.\nThe U.S. Department of Energy said Friday it will end its contract for the American Centrifuge Project in Piketon at the end of the month.\nThe move affects about 235 employees at the site, according to Centrus Energy, the operator of the plant.\n\u201cWe have concluded that continued support from the federal government for additional data from Piketon operations has limited remaining value,\u201d the statement said."}
