(Washington Free Beacon) Tom Coburn, the former senator currently leading a movement for a Convention of States, unloaded on Congress during a hearing before the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Wednesday.

‘America doesn’t trust you anymore. That’s the truth,’ Coburn said, appearing alongside the head of the Government Accountability Office during the hearing to discuss duplicative federal programs.

The GAO recently released its annual report, finding the federal government could save hundreds of billions of dollars just by consolidating duplicative programs.
