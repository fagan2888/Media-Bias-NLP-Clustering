The galaxy also provides information regarding candidates\u2019 backgrounds and which special-interest groups have funded their campaigns.\n\nVote Easy: A feature that allows users to search for candidates by their ZIP code, then quizzes them on their positions on various issues. Interactive yard signs move closer or farther away depending on the level of agreement with each candidate, helping you discover your \u201cpolitical soul mate.\u201d\n\nVote Smart promises to be unbiased, non-partisan of facts about candidates.\n\nKimball said this dedication is evidenced by his friendship with Sen. John McCain, whom he once ran against as the Democratic nominee for U.S. Senate from Arizona. Before their final debate, Kimball was advised to \u201cattack\u201d McCain, something he didn\u2019t want to do.\n\n\u201cHe went through five-and-a-half years of hell,\u201d Kimball said of the former POW. \u201cI have incredible respect for him. I admire the guy; I didn\u2019t want to attack him.\u201d\n\nKimball instead used the time to tell voters how campaign money is spent on three things\u2014market analysis of voters, consultants and media time. Whoever can use these most effectively to \u201cbombard voters with emotional nonsense\u201d wins.\n\nKimball lost.\n\n\u201cSomewhere, politicians decided it was more efficient to move us emotionally rather than persuade us intellectually,\u201d said Kimball.\n\nKimball and McCain went on to become friends, and McCain later served on Vote Smart\u2019s board of directors. Politicians who join Vote Smart\u2019s board must be matched with a \u201cpolitical opposite.\u201d For example, two of the earliest board members were Presidents Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford.\n\nMost of Vote Smart\u2019s research is done by unpaid interns and volunteers, who are rewarded with housing at Vote Smart\u2019s Montana ranch.\n\nVolunteers are greeted by signs all over the office that say, \u201cCheck your politics at the door.\u201d\n\nElm said she is inspired by the volunteers and that there has been no need to ask them to disclose their personal politics.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s uplifting to see how much integrity they have,\u201d said Elm.\n\nIn an interview with the The Daily Signal, Kimball emphasized that it is necessary for a free people to have access to factual information about their leaders:\n\n\u201cThomas Jefferson once said that \u2018if a nation expects to be ignorant and free, it expects what never was and never will be.\u2019 Our founding was a huge enterprise. The Founders took a chance. Everybody else in the world thought we were nuts. But somehow it worked, because they knew information was power.\n\n\u201cWe can only put the information out there. We don\u2019t advertise; we don\u2019t have the budget. We just hope people tell people.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "With the midterm elections mere weeks away, Vote Smart is offering voters new services that \u201cwould make the Founders weep with joy.\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "With the midterm elections mere weeks away, Vote Smart is offering voters new services that \u201cwould make the Founders weep with joy.\u201d", "title": "As Elections Near, Group Aims to Help Citizens Vote Smart", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/178759183.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-10-02T23:36:38+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1tlLmPg"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "With the midterm elections mere weeks away, Vote Smart is offering voters new services that \u201cwould make the Founders weep with joy.\u201d", "title": "As Elections Near, Group Aims to Help Citizens Vote Smart", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/178759183.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "politics", "published_time": "2014-10-05T03:01:52+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-02T23:36:38+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "vote smart, elections, midterms, 2014 election"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd266b\"", "article_summary": "Most of Vote Smart\u2019s research is done by unpaid interns and volunteers, who are rewarded with housing at Vote Smart\u2019s Montana ranch.\n\u201cVote Smart was put together to assist voters who are confused or even cynical with unbiased information about candidates,\u201d said Adelaide Elm, a board member and senior adviser to Vote Smart.\nKimball and McCain went on to become friends, and McCain later served on Vote Smart\u2019s board of directors.\n\u201cWe want information to be accessible for average citizens rather than just political junkies.\u201d\u201cCandidates are applying for a job,\u201d Vote Smart President Richard Kimball told The Daily Signal.\nPoliticians who join Vote Smart\u2019s board must be matched with a \u201cpolitical opposite.\u201d For example, two of the earliest board members were Presidents Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford."}
