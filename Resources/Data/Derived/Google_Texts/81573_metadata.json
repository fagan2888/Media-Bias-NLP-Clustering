But so far, just 140 of the nearly 800 who lost coverage this month have signed up \u2013 fewer than 20 percent.\n\nThose who lost Medicaid coverage Sept. 1 have until Oct. 1 to sign up for private health insurance. But unless they found alternative forms of coverage, they\u2019re likely uninsured now, said Jim Wadleigh, CEO of the exchange, Access Health CT. That\u2019s an outcome critics of the cut warned could happen.\n\nWhen asked why more people hadn\u2019t signed up, Wadleigh pointed to cost.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s expensive,\u201d he said. \u201cI think even if it\u2019s $10 a month, that\u2019s still a lot of money.\u201d\n\nThe cut to Medicaid eligibility affects parents of minor children with income above 155 percent of the poverty level, the equivalent of $37,587 for a family of four. Gov. Dannel P. Malloy proposed cutting eligibility earlier this year, and legislators agreed to the cut \u2013 smaller than Malloy's original proposal \u2013 to help balance the budget.\n\nAlthough the number of people who lost Medicaid coverage this month is relatively small, another 18,550 people are expected to lose coverage next summer, and officials have said they\u2019re hoping to learn from the experience of the smaller group to better handle the next, larger cut.\n\nIn all, the cut to the state\u2019s Medicaid program \u2013 known as HUSKY \u2013 is expected to affect approximately 19,750 parents. It\u2019s occurring in two phases because the vast majority of those parents qualify for 12 months of additional coverage, something required under federal law for people with wages from a job or another source of earned income.\n\nThe other 1,200 parents, who don\u2019t have earned income, were slated to lose HUSKY coverage Sept. 1. But about 400 were found to qualify for continued Medicaid coverage; pregnant women are not subject to the cut, for example, and others could have income that is now below the cutoff level. Another 80 were deemed to be potentially eligible for a portion of the Medicaid program for people with disabilities, according to the state Department of Social Services.\n\nThe weeks leading up to the termination date included confusion among some clients. Some termination notices were sent incorrectly to people who were not scheduled to be cut off this month, state Healthcare Advocate Victoria Veltri said.\n\nWorkers in the exchange\u2019s call center attempted to call all of those who were slated to lose HUSKY.\n\nWadleigh, the exchange CEO, said the call center would conduct another round of calls to about 400 people for whom they had previously left voicemails, in hopes of helping them sign up for insurance.\n\nWadleigh said there was an indication that outreach efforts have been kicking in. As of Aug. 20, fewer than 100 people had signed up for coverage through the exchange. As of Wednesday, 140 people had.\n\nWhat will coverage cost them?\n\nWith federal tax credits to discount monthly premium costs, two parents in a family of four earning $39,000 per year would pay $153 per month for a plan with discounted cost-sharing and an $800 deductible. Their cheapest premium option would cost far less: $1.44 per month. But that would come with a $12,400 deductible, requiring them to pay that sum before the plan pays for any non-preventive care. (For $1.69 per month, they could get a plan with a $6,000 deductible.)\n\nThe results so far appear similar to the experience in Rhode Island, Wadleigh said, calling it unfortunate. When that state lowered its Medicaid income limit, 11 percent of those expected to lose coverage had enrolled in the state\u2019s exchange four months later, according to an analysis by researchers from the University of Massachusetts Medical School\u2019s Center for Health Law and Economics, conducted on behalf of the Connecticut Health Foundation.\n\nThe researchers noted that while many were probably uninsured, others had remained eligible for Medicaid or had signed up for employer-sponsored coverage.\n\nConnecticut's HUSKY eligibility level for children is not changing, but the researchers warned that the cut could nonetheless affect children. Maine reduced Medicaid eligibility for parents in 2013, they wrote, and within 7 months, the number of children enrolled dropped by 13 percent, even though eligibility limits for children had not changed.\n\nAsked about the sign-up rate, Malloy spokesman Devon Puglia said, \u201cthe budget was filled with tough choices.\u201d He noted that Connecticut still has one of the highest Medicaid eligibility thresholds in the country and said the state continues to provide \u201ctop-notch\u201d Medicaid services. He also noted that Connecticut\u2019s exchange is considered a model for other states.\n\n\u201cThere are options \u2013 quality options \u2013 out there for families and it's our hope that they utilize them,\u201d Puglia said.", "article_metadata": {"standout": "http://ctmirror.org/2015/09/11/few-who-lost-medicaid-have-purchased-insurance/", "news_keywords": "Budget/Economy, Health Care, Access Health CT, Affordable Care Act, Budget 2016, HUSKY transition, Medicaid", "original-source": "http://ctmirror.org/2015/09/11/few-who-lost-medicaid-have-purchased-insurance/", "og": {"site_name": "The CT Mirror", "description": "When state lawmakers scaled back Medicaid eligibility for thousands of low-income parents to help balance this year\u2019s budget, proponents argued the parents could buy deeply discounted coverage through the state\u2019s health insurance exchange.
