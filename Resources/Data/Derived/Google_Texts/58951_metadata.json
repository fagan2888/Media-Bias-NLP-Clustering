The attacks, he said, \u201cthreaten the viability of the European Union project as a whole.\u201d\n\nThe European Union project is the effort to unite nation-states together using a series of treaties, conventions, and agreements that encourage cooperation and discourage war.\n\nSimcox said it\u2019s too early to tell if the attacks were the result of a resource failure or an intelligence failure, but somewhere, he said, the system broke down.\n\n\u201cDid they have [the terrorists] on the radar and choose not to follow them, or are they not on the radar at all?\u201d Simcox asked.\n\nSimcox, who co-wrote \u201cAl-Qaeda in the United States: A Complete Analysis of Terrorism Offenses,\u201d a book profiling every known court conviction in America linked to al-Qaeda, said much of the blame falls on Europe\u2019s \u201copen border system,\u201d which allows people to travel between countries with little to no security checkpoints.\n\n\u201cThe checks between countries are nothing like you would expect coming from the U.K. to the states or something like that,\u201d Simcox said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s been a great asset for terrorists operating in Europe because after the Paris terror attacks, they were able to flee to Belgium and not be stopped.\u201d\n\nEurope\u2019s \u201copen border system\u201d came as a result of the Schengen Agreement, which was signed in 1985 and went into effect in 1995. The majority of European countries, except the United Kingdom, have signed on to the treaty, which abolishes \u201call internal borders in lieu of a single external border.\u201d\n\nThe treaty, Simcox said, predates the era of transnational terrorism and has now become a dangerous tool for terrorists.\n\n\u201cNot only are people not checked; there\u2019s also the problem of checking them against various terrorist watch lists,\u201d Simcox said. \u201cI think the scale of the problem is too much. And the safeguards are insufficient.\u201d\n\nComplicating things further, Europe has become a \u201cblurry mess\u201d of values, Simcox said, sending mixed messages to refugees and immigrants on whether or not they need to assimilate.\n\n\u201cEurope needs to make clear what it stands for. Moments like this help clarify that, I hope.\u201d\n\nBelgian Counterterrorism Official: \u2018It\u2019s Very Grave\u2019\n\nFrom Buzzfeed:\n\nOne Belgian counterterrorism official told BuzzFeed News last week that due to the small size of the Belgian government and the huge numbers of open investigations\u2014into Belgian citizens suspected of either joining ISIS, being part of radical groups in Belgium, and the ongoing investigations into last November\u2019s attacks in Paris, which appeared to be at least partially planned in Brussels and saw the participation of several Belgian citizens and residents\u2014virtually every police detective and military intelligence officer in the country was focused on international jihadi investigations. \u2018We just don\u2019t have the people to watch anything else and, frankly, we don\u2019t have the infrastructure to properly investigate or monitor hundreds of individuals suspected of terror links, as well as pursue the hundreds of open files and investigations we have,\u2019 the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media, said. \u2018It\u2019s literally an impossible situation and, honestly, it\u2019s very grave.\u2019\n\nNetherlands Counterterrorism Studies Professor: \u2018A Bit Embarrassing\u2019\n\nWhat happened in Belgium is an embarrassment to the intelligence community, Edwin Bakker, director of the Centre for Terrorism and Counterterrorism at Leiden University in The Hague and a research fellow at the International Centre for Counter-Terrorism, said.\n\n\u201cIt took them several months and this guy was not hiding on his own,\u201d Bakker, who is also a professor of counterterrorism studies at Leiden University, told The Sydney Morning Herald. \u201cThat makes it a bit embarrassing for the intelligence community in Belgium.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cguy\u201d Bakker referenced was Abdeslam, the Belgium-born suspect in the Paris attacks whom authorities arrested in Belgium last week.\n\n\u201cApparently the intelligence position is not good enough to find these people or even to find the most wanted terrorist in Europe,\u201d Bakker said. He added:\n\nThe events of today increase both worries about the intelligence position of Belgian authorities as well as how many supporters there are.\n\nProblems and roadblocks to prevent terrorist attacks in Belgium stem from communication issues within the government, he said.\n\n\u201cBelgium is a federal state and that\u2019s always an advantage for terrorists,\u201d Bakker told Reuters in November. \u201cHaving several layers of government hampers the flow of information between investigators.\u201d\n\nThe Sydney Morning Herald reported:\n\nBoth Professor Bakker and Monash University terrorism expert Greg Barton [of Australia] said there was a strong chance that the Brussels attacks were carried out by extremists who were on the run after the Abdeslam arrest and decided they might as well launch the assault before they were caught.\n\nMatthew Levitt, The Washington Institute: \u2018Belgians Have a Really Big Problem\u2019\n\n\u201cBelgians have a really big problem because they have the largest number per capita of western foreign fighters from any country,\u201d Matthew Levitt, director of The Washington Institute\u2019s Stein Program on Counterterrorism and Intelligence, told Business Insider. \u201cThe numbers are simply overwhelming.\u201d\n\nBelgium police have worked with French counterterrorism authorities but have \u201ca problem both in terms of getting on top of the immediate threat that has developed over time\u201d and putting in a plan to prevent Islamic radicalization, Levitt, a former U.S. intelligence and counterterrorism official, says.\n\nLevitt was in Belgium last week meeting with counterterrorism and intelligence officials.\n\nI spent last week in #Belgium meeting ct officials (& taking metro) \u2013 they are only recently aware of the scope of their ct threats \u2014 Matthew Levitt (@Levitt_Matt) March 22, 2016\n\nA week ago today I gave this lecture in #Brussels re Islamic State \u2014 I took the metro to get there @WashInstitute pic.twitter.com/v6yNqp38Ju \u2014 Matthew Levitt (@Levitt_Matt) March 22, 2016\n\n\u201cThe Belgians, over the past year, have been caught by surprise a bit that they are a target,\u201d Levitt told The Washington Post. \u201cThat\u2019s not a surprise anymore. I think the realization now is that the pace of the response has to be picked up significantly, and that has to be both raiding safe houses and getting into these neighborhoods and addressing the things that make people feel so disconnected.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "\u201cDid they have on the radar and choose not to follow them, or are they not on the radar at all?\u201d a terrorism and national security expert asks.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "\u201cDid they have on the radar and choose not to follow them, or are they not on the radar at all?\u201d a terrorism and national security expert asks.", "title": "Brussels Terrorist Attacks \u2018Grave,\u2019 \u2018A Bit Embarrassing\u2019", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/epalivetwo078548_cropped.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-03-24T22:38:29+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1UOFxL6"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "\u201cDid they have on the radar and choose not to follow them, or are they not on the radar at all?\u201d a terrorism and national security expert asks.", "title": "Brussels Terrorist Attacks \u2018Grave,\u2019 \u2018A Bit Embarrassing\u2019", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/epalivetwo078548_cropped.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Security", "tag": "terrorism", "published_time": "2016-03-24T14:33:42+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-24T22:38:29+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Brussels, Belgium, national security, attacks, terrorism, ISIS, European Union, Europe"}, "article_summary": "Problems and roadblocks to prevent terrorist attacks in Belgium stem from communication issues within the government, he said.\n\u201cBelgium is a federal state and that\u2019s always an advantage for terrorists,\u201d Bakker told Reuters in November.\nOn Tuesday, the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, claimed responsibility for both attacks, according to news reports.\n\u201cThat makes it a bit embarrassing for the intelligence community in Belgium.\u201dThe \u201cguy\u201d Bakker referenced was Abdeslam, the Belgium-born suspect in the Paris attacks whom authorities arrested in Belgium last week.\n\u201cNot only are people not checked; there\u2019s also the problem of checking them against various terrorist watch lists,\u201d Simcox said."}
