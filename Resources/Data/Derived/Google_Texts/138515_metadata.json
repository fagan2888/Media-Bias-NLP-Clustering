Glenn Grothman (R-West Bend) announced Thursday he will challenge longtime Republican congressman Tom Petri in the 6th Congressional District.\n\nGrothman made the announcement on Charlie Sykes' morning talk-show on WTMJ-AM (620). Asked if he was running, Grothman replied, \"Absolutely.\"\n\nGrothman conceded he did not currently live within district boundaries, but said he planned to move to Campbellsport in Fond du Lac County. \"I don't think it's going to be an issue,\" he said.\n\nHe also said he expected the state's Republican congressional delegation to back Petri.\n\n\"There is apparently a deal between Wisconsin Republican congressmen that they come to the aid of each other,\" he said. \"They come to bat for each other no matter what.\"\n\nAsked last month about the growing number of Republicans considering a challenge, a Petri spokesman said his boss is up for the race.\n\n\"Congressman Petri is running for re-election,\" said Petri staffer Lee Brooks on March 21. \"He plans on circulating his nomination papers soon.\"\n\nBut one Republican leader, who asked not to be named, said Petri has been rattled by this talk of a possible GOP primary. The source put the odds at only 50-50 that the 73-year-old incumbent will run this fall.\n\nAmong other Republicans considering a possible bid are state Rep. Duey Stroebel (R-Cedarburg) and businessman John Hiller, a longtime adviser to Gov. Scott Walker. Sources said state Sen. Joe Leibham (R-Sheboygan) would consider running only if Petri retires.\n\nOn Thursday, Grothman said he would conduct an issue-oriented campaign. He said he would campaign against the Affordable Care Act, and said Petri, who voted against the legislation, \"implied he didn't mind a bigger government role in health care.\"\n\nGrothman said Petri also backed No Child Left Behind, which Grothman characterized as a massive expansion of federal control of schools.\n\nIn a statement released later Thursday, Grothman said: \u201cLike all Americans, I am frustrated by a federal government that seems to be out of control at a time when by many standards our great country is in a state of decline. When looking at a federal debt that has risen to $17.5 trillion and an overall federal budget that has gone up by 68% since 2000. I, like others, am troubled about our country\u2019s future.\n\n\u201cI am even more concerned about the massive trend towards government dependency. The number of people on FoodShare has gone from 17 million as recently as 2001 to 47 million today. The number of people on disability has risen from five million people to almost nine million people in the last thirteen years, all while job safety has improved greatly.\n\n\u201cThis rush towards government reliance has lead to the well-documented destruction of the American nuclear family, which will have severe, negative consequences for the next generation.\"\n\nGrothman, a former West Bend attorney, is currently the assistant majority leader of the Senate, and has represented the 20th Senate district since 2005. He represented the 58th Assembly district from 1993 through 2004.\n\nPetri has been a congressman since 1979. He is currently a member of both the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and the Committee on Education and the Workforce (formerly Education and Labor).\n\nDaniel Bice of the Journal Sentinel staff contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"title": "State Sen.
