Opinion still is sharply divided by party, with 70 percents of Democrats viewing the law favorably and 75 percent of Republicans viewing it unfavorably. Independents fall in the middle; 42 percent like it and 46 percent don't.\n\nFor the first time, the Kaiser Family Foundation monthly tracking poll shows that more people are in favor of Obamacare than opposed. Barely, and within the margin of error, but a turn-around.The \"fix-it or repeal-it\" numbers remain consistent: 46 percent combined say either improve it (24 percent) or leave it alone (22 percent) versus 41 percent who want it scaled back (12 percent) or repealed (29 percent).This all reflects the recent Bloomberg poll that showed more people believing the law should be left to work rather than repealed, and that the repeal crowd is the same group of dead-enders it's been from the beginning. That crowd\u2014the base the Republicans continue to play to\u2014isn't going to change. But it's also not the population that is most helped by Obamacare since it skews old enough to be on Medicare.\n\nAll of this should be weighing on the minds of at least two Supreme Court justices\u2014Chief John Roberts and Anthony Kennedy\u2014while they consider whether or not to gut subsidies to people buying health insurance on the federal exchanges. A decision to gut the law is not going to be popular, and it's not going to help their Republican friends in Congress one bit.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Daily Kos", "description": "For the first time, the Kaiser Family ...", "title": "New poll shows turn-around on Obamacare popularity", "url": "http://www.dailykos.com/story/2015/4/21/1379179/-Kaiser-tracking-poll-shows-turn-around-on-Obamacare-popularity", "image": "http://images.dailykos.com/images/132356/story_image/RTR4S1YH.jpg?1425500075", "type": "article"}, "csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "fb": {"app_id": 170357783709}, "twitter": {"description": "For the first time, the Kaiser Family Foundation monthly tracking poll shows that more people are in favor of Obamacare than opposed.
