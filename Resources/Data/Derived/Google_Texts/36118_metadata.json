And while the PGP isn\u2019t as fetching as Andie MacDowell\u2019s Rita Hanson, tax geeks will surely want to check things out. For a review of the estates, gifts, and trusts items in the PGP, please see Kathleen Adcock's post \"IRS offers menu with lots of options for estates, gifts, and trusts in its Priority Guidance Plan.\"\n\nRevenue Procedures updating grantor and contributor reliance criteria under \u00a7 170 and \u00a7 509\n\nRevenue Procedure to updateRev. Proc. 2011-33 for EO Select Check.\n\nUpdates to the reliance criteria have been priorities since late 2009. However, we understand about as much about this project and its purpose as Phil understood the reasons he was trapped in a time loop. It remains a riddle, wrapped in a mystery, inside an enigma.\n\nAlso in this area, and returning for a third year, the IRS aims to update Rev. Proc. 2011-33[1] to account for the EO Select Check System. The system was created in 2012 in order to make it easier for taxpayers to determine the status of organizations by combining the data in Publication 78 with the auto-revocation list and the 990-N e-postcard database. Currently, an FAQ on the IRS website states that contributors can rely on information derived from the system. Presumably, the update will incorporate that FAQ into more formal guidance.\n\nRegulations under \u00a7 501(a) , \u00a7 501(c)(3) , and \u00a7508 allowing adoption of streamlined application process for \u00a7 501(c)(3) exemption\n\nRev. Proc. setting forth procedures for issuing determination letters to organizations using the streamlined application process\n\nLike the snow that falls as Phil and Rita share a kiss in front of the ice sculpture in the penultimate scene, this project is new to the PGP. And it will be as ephemeral as a snowflake, as the IRS has already completed its work. The IRS published final and temporary regulations[2] as well as proposed regulations[3] to grant authority to set up the streamlined process (embodied in the new Form 1023-EZ). The comment period on the proposed regulations closed September 30, 2014.\n\nThe IRS also contemporaneously published Rev. Proc. 2014-40[4] to outline the procedures for issuing determination letters on exempt status to organizations using the streamlined process and Form 1023-EZ. For a summary of the regulations and the Rev. Proc., see 33 Tax Mgmt. Wkly. Rep. 898 (July 7, 2014).\n\nProposed regulations under \u00a7501(c) relating to political campaign intervention\n\nApparently the IRS wanted a piece of Phil Connors for itself. After making the topic a priority in last year\u2019s PGP, the IRS published proposed regulations[5] in November 2013 that would have greatly expanded prohibited \u201ccandidate-related political activity\u201d for social welfare organizations. The proposal received nearly 170,000 comments, most of them critical. The proposal also generated significant criticism in the media and from members of Congress. So, the IRS stepped out in front of the oncoming truck in May 2014, announcing it would abandon the proposed rules and start over, so the project returns to the PGP.\n\nFinal regulations under \u00a7 512(a)(3)(E) explaining the UBTI computation for VEBAs described in \u00a7 501(c)(9) .\n\nThe first set of proposed regulations on the limitation on amounts set aside for exempt purposes were published in 1986. Updating the regulations became a priority back in 2010, with the IRS finally issuing new proposed regulations[6] in February 2014 that withdrew the lingering 1986 proposals. The project remains on the PGP with the IRS seeking to finalization the regulations. For a summary of the proposed regulations see 33 Tax Mgmt. Wkly. Rep. 186 (Feb. 10, 2014).\n\nTwo comments were submitted in response, both of which noted the divergence between the IRS\u2019s proposed interpretation and that adopted by the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in Sherwin-Williams Co. Employee Health Plan Trust v. Commissioner.[7] Both comments endorse amending the final regulation to apply only to years beginning after publication (as opposed to the current language applying it to all years ending after publication).\n\nFinal regulations on application for exemption as a \u00a7501(c)(29) nonprofit health insurer\n\nEven when things are new, they\u2019re not so new. Section 501(c)(29) was added by the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and allows certain qualified nonprofit health insurance issuers (QNHIIs) to obtain exempt status. While this guidance is a new priority, the regulatory project overall is not. February 2012 proposed regulations[8] provided the IRS with authority to set up QNHII application procedures, which simultaneously established such procedures in Rev. Proc. 2012-11.[9] (For a summary of the proposed regulation see 31 Tax. Mgmt. Wkly. Rep.228 (Feb. 13, 2012).) The comments appear to be non-substantive, seeking only to have the IRS explicitly include requirements already contained in statutory provisions but that hasn\u2019t sped the process along. Perhaps the IRS is waiting until after they learn piano and French to tackle this problem.\n\nFinal regulations under \u00a7501(r) and \u00a76033 on ACA-added requirements for charitable hospitals\n\nThe ACA added several new requirements for charitable hospitals seeking to maintain exempt status. The IRS issued a partial set of proposed regulations in June 2012.[10] Putting the cart before the horse, they added finalization of the regulations to the 2012-2013 PGP but did not publish the remainder of the proposed regulations until April 2013.[11] Regardless, the finalization remains outstanding as we head into 2014-2015, so one could say \u201cno harm, no foul.\u201d Taken in tandem the NPRMs propose rules relating to all four of the significant new requirements imposed on charitable hospitals: (1) development of a financial assistance policy; (2) establishing emergency medical care policies; (3) performing community health needs assessments; and (4) limitations on charges and collections as to assistance-eligible individuals. The regulations also establish sanctions for failure to satisfy the new requirements.\n\nThe NPRMs generated hundreds of comments \u2013 many expressing concern that the regulations are overly prescriptive (and restrictive) in mandating specific methods of achieving statutory goals and that the emergency care language unnecessarily exceeds the requirements placed on hospitals by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which could lead to conflicting obligations. Given the amount and nature of the feedback, it is unsurprising that the finalization is taking some time. In the interim the IRS has issued guidance that charitable hospitals can rely on the proposed regulations pending finalization.\n\nAdditional guidance on \u00a7509(a)(3) supporting organizations\n\nGuidance for supporting organizations, and specifically \u201cType III supporting organizations seeking to qualify as functionally integrated by supporting a governmental supported organization\u201d has been a regular item on the PGP, having first been added in 2011. With the project running into its fourth year, we can be thankful that earlier this year the IRS released Notice 2014-4,[12] which continues to apply the \u201cbut for\u201d test of former Reg. \u00a71.509(a)-4(i)(3)(ii) to such organizations through the end of 2016. For a summary of Notice 2014-4 see 32 Tax Mgmt. Wkly. Rep. 1789 (Dec. 30, 2013).\n\nGuidance under \u00a7512 regarding allocation of dual use facility expenses\n\nThis is the lone genuinely new addition to the PGP exempt orgs universe, having resulted from recommendations by the IRS\u2019s Advisory Committee on Tax Exempt and Governmental Entities in its June 2014 Report. The committee noted that current guidelines do not adequately distinguish between reasonable and unreasonable allocation methods, causing confusion and leading to considerable underreporting of unrelated business taxable income. The recommendation is that guidance take the form of a revenue ruling that would, at a minimum, list methods that would constitute a safe-harbor and those that would be per se unreasonable.\n\nRegulations concerning the fractions rule under \u00a7514(c)(9)\n\nA regulations project to deal with the fractions rule under \u00a7514(c)(9)(E) has been on the PGP since the 2012-13 plan year. The fractions rule serves to determine when an exempt organization\u2019s income from partnerships holding leveraged real estate will be subject to the debt-financed income rules. Commentators have complained that the current Code provisions and regulations are so complex, and riddled with exceptions and special rules, that it is virtually impossible for organizations to be certain that they are actually satisfying them.\n\nA January 2010 report regarding \u00a7514(c)(9)(E) submitted by the ABA\u2019s Tax Section included numerous comments on the existing regime and requested additional guidance on permissible partnership allocations under that provision. The report noted that \u201cthe fractions rule often thwarts legitimate business arrangements\u201d, but that the comments were aimed at \u201celiminat[ing] certain significant problems under the fractions rule that arise in commercially common transactions.\u201d\n\nGuidance under \u00a74941 regarding foundation investments in partnerships with disqualified persons\n\nGuidance on the treatment of a private foundation\u2019s investment in a partnership in which other partners are disqualified persons makes just its second appearance on the PGP. The IRS\u2019s intent in this area is unclear, but a piece published by the ABA last year when the topic first appeared posits that the issue arises from the proliferation of \u201cfamily offices,\u201d family limited partnerships and other similar structures designed to manage assets of family members in a manner that takes advantage of economies of scale on costs and expenses while also making it possible to meet investment thresholds in desirable assets. There remain questions about whether, and to what extent, such investments by a private foundation might escape being characterized as self-dealing transactions.\n\nFinal regulations under \u00a74942 and \u00a74945 on reliance standards for good faith determinations\n\nLike the QNHII guidance discussed above, this project is both new and old \u2013 proposed regulations[13] were published in September 2012, but the project is new to the PGP. The proposed regs provide that a private foundation may rely on either an affidavit by the receiving foreign organization or on written advice from a qualified practitioner that the recipient is the equivalent of a domestic public charity. The affidavit or advice must include sufficient facts to allow the IRS to determine that the recipient would qualify as a public charity. For a summary of the proposed regulations, see 31 Tax Mgmt. Wkly. Rep.1278 (Sept. 24, 2012).\n\nThe NPRM requested specific comments regarding three issues: (1) whether guidance setting out the information that should be collected in reaching an equivalency determination should be modified in light of changes to the public support test; (2) whether reliance on an affidavit or written advice should be limited to a certain period after receipt of the advice; and (3) whether reliance on affidavits should be retained and, if so, whether it should be limited or restricted.\n\nThe comments are generally in agreement that: (1) guidance regarding information collection should be revised to reflect the changes to the public support test; (2) reliance on advice or on an affidavit can be limited to a certain set time period (though the commenters diverge on the appropriate length of the period); and (3) organizations should continue to be permitted to rely on grantee affidavits in making equivalency determinations.\n\nFinal regulations under \u00a74944 on program-related investments\n\nThe finalization of regulations under \u00a74944 remains a priority for the IRS for the third straight year, with the overall program-related investment project making its sixth appearance on the PGP (the issuance of guidance regarding this issue first appeared in the 2009-10 PGP). The proposed regulation,[14] published in April 2012, adds nine new examples to Reg. \u00a753.4944-3(b) in order to provide guidance on a more current range of additional investments and whether they qualify as program-related investments excepted from the \u00a74944 excise tax. The examples generally make clear that a wider variety of investments will qualify as program related than was evident from the existing regulation.\n\nThough the comments submitted were uniformly positive and urged adoption of the examples, there were some submissions that requested further clarification of a few items. Specifically, that the IRS specify the extent to which each fact in several compound fact patterns is dispositive of the issue under \u00a74944. Presumably the IRS is seeking to modify the examples to provide more clarity.\n\nGuidance regarding excise taxes on donor-advised funds and fund management (\u00a74966 and \u00a74967)\n\nThe longest-running item on the list \u2013 the IRS has prioritized guidance under \u00a74966 and \u00a74967, both added by the Pension Protection Act of 2006, since the 2007-08 PGP. Back then the priority was proposed regulations, but the IRS has demoted it, aiming for only the amorphous \u201cguidance\u201d since the 2013-2014 PGP. To date, the IRS has addressed only two very limited issues under \u00a74966 with \u201cInterim Guidance\u201d via Notice 2006-109.[15]\n\nA December 2011 Treasury report indicated that a number of respondents to an IRS survey on the topic expressed concern that the new statutory provisions are unclear and create uncertainty that could have a chilling effect on grant-making and the charitable sector. Responses diverged as to the propriety of the rules in the first place and an incredibly wide range of suggestions were made on how to shape regulations to achieve the statutory goals and intent. The fact that the priority is no longer \u201cregulations\u201d may indicate that the IRS has found it difficult to accommodate the range of concerns in the context of formal rules and may be looking to more informal guidance to address the issue.\n\nGuidance under \u00a76033 relating to the reporting of contributions\n\nThis item is new to the PGP this year, but it is not immediately clear what the scope or focus of the contemplated guidance will be as the topic was not raised in any of the recommendations submitted by the public for inclusion in the PGP. It is possible that the project relates to the IRS\u2019s recent concerns regarding \u00a7501(c)(4) groups engaged in political activities and the related regulatory project concerning those activities.\n\nFinal regulations under \u00a76104(c)\n\nFor the fourth year in a row, the IRS will prioritize finalizing proposed regulations under \u00a76104(c), which governs when and to what extent the IRS will disclose returns and return information about \u00a7501(c)(3) and certain other exempt organizations to appropriate state officials. Updating the relevant regulations has been a priority since the 2008-09 PGP. The proposed regulations[16] would completely replace Reg. \u00a7301.6104(c)-1 to provide guidance on IRS disclosure procedures as applied to the expanded range of information that may be disclosed under the 2006 amendments to \u00a76104(c). Generally, the IRS proposes to implement the safeguard procedures currently in place for the \u00a76103(d) program, requiring states requesting information to enter into agreements detailing information security requirements and responsibilities. For a summary of the proposed regulation, see 30 Tax Mgmt. Wkly. Rep. 345 (Mar. 21, 2011).\n\nOne comment, by the National Association of State Charity Officials raised several concerns with the regulation, noting that the safeguard requirements appear to have actually reduced the amount of information disclosure and cooperation between the IRS and state officials as the requirements are cumbersome and costly. The safeguard requirements have also led to state officials eschewing electronic information and data due to their inability to insure that state data centers can handle the requirements for such data. The comment also indicates concerns about the clarity of certain provisions and particularly the apparent restriction on the disclosure of information to agents and contractors, such as expert witnesses and litigation support services providers, working with state officials who obtained information for purposes of developing enforcement actions against an entity.\n\nFinal regulations under \u00a77611 relating to church tax inquiries and examinations\n\nThe IRS continues to prioritize (for the fifth year) the finalization of 2009 proposed regulations[17] concerning the limitations on church examinations and inquiries. The proposal was necessitated by the reorganization of the IRS from regional to subject matter groups and the elimination of the regional commissioners and counsel. The amendments substitute the Director, Exempt Organizations and the Division Counsel/Associate Chief Counsel, Tax Exempt and Government Entities for the Regional Commissioners and Regional Counsels, respectively. The amendments also place authority for granting written approval for a second inquiry in the Commissioner or Deputy Commissioner, Tax Exempt and Government Entities, replacing the Assistant Commissioner (Employee Plans and Exempt Organizations).\n\nA number of comments were submitted in response. Those that addressed the actual issue at hand noted concerns that vesting these authorities in the TE/GE function presented possible conflicts of interest, and failed to adhere to the letter and spirit of the statute\u2019s requirement for a \u201chigh-level\u201d official to approve such examinations. Several comments (e.g., ones from Caplin & Drysdale and the Alliance Defense Fund) cited United States v. Living Word Christian Center,[18] in which the district court, adopting a magistrate\u2019s report, held that the Director, Exempt Organization Examinations was not a sufficiently high-level official to approve a church inquiry and that the pre-reorganization requirement of a regional commissioner was meant to place the initial approval in the hands of a person with a high level of political accountability and a broad scope of authority. The comments disputed that simply moving the approval up one level was sufficient as the Director, Exempt Organizations continues to suffer from a lack of independence and political accountability.\n\nThe IRS held a public hearing on the proposed regulation, requested by numerous commenters, on January 20, 2010. Witnesses were uniformly opposed to the proposal and reiterated the points made in their written comments.\n\n[1] 2011-25 I.R.B. 887 (June 20, 2011).\n\n[2] T.D. 9674, 79 Fed.
