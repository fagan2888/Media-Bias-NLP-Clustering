Authorities say a U.S. Marshals Service deputy in South Dakota shot and killed a man wanted in a homicide in South Carolina.

Sioux Falls Police Officer Sam Clemens says authorities received a tip that 37-year-old Lonnie Haskell Powers Jr., of Summerville, South Carolina, was in Sioux Falls. They tracked Powers to a drug store parking lot Saturday afternoon.

When confronted by officers with weapons drawn, Clemens says, Powers pulled out a handgun. A deputy marshal shot him once in the chest while he was still in his car.

The Berkeley County Sheriff's Office in South Carolina says Powers was wanted in the killing of 55-year-old James Anthony Hill, who was found shot to death in his home near Ridgeville, South Carolina, on Dec. 13. The motive is still under investigation.
