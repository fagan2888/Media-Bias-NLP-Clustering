Since climate deniers love it when NASA says something that can be deliberately skewed as suggesting that the planet isn’t warming, here’s hoping everyone pays attention to this announcement, too: according to the U.S. space agency, last September was Earth’s hottest on record.

And as Slate’s Eric Holthaus points out, September’s high global temperatures mean Earth just saw its hottest-ever six month stretch, going back to an unusually warm April. Every month from then to now was the warmest of its kind, except for July, which was fourth-warmest. At this pace, according to NOAA, we’re on track to see the hottest year in recorded history — and that’s without El Nino, which has a good chance of starting soon and which will bring regional warming. (As Joe Romm of Climate Progress explains, “it’s usually the combination of the long-term manmade warming trend and the regional El Niño warming pattern that leads to new global temperature records.”)
