Bush\u2019s expected financial advantages and name identification are enough to keep him in the top slot, but as he prepares to make his official announcement his grasp is getting more tenuous. The big weekend in Iowa reinforced the trend: Bush in his family clique and Walker the leader of the rest of the pack. And despite some dim polling news, Marco Rubio is still pretty clearly ahead of the rest of the pack in terms of his ability to make a broad appeal across party divisions\n\n\n\nBut Rubio ought to keep his eye on Carly Fiorina, who is building up some momentum. Despite starting from flat-line name identification, Fiorina has consistently impressed on the stump and recently returned from what is said to have been a successful West Coast fundraising swing. Fiorina still lags in the horse race, but if she keeps doing what she has done in early states, Rubio will have to start thinking about her as a threat. While she still struggles to be seen as a top-of-the-ticket choice rather than a running mate, she is gaining an influential following.\n\n\n\nRand Paul is the other gainer this week, snapping back after his domestic surveillance brinksmanship. The very best news for Paul after his Senate high-wire act last week was that nothing happened \u2013 no attacks, no lengthy interruptions of surveillance capacity, etc. Having proved to his base that he\u2019s still their man, Paul can get back to an effort to broaden his appeal.\n\n\n\nOn the Radar - Chris Christie, Rick Santorum, Bobby Jindal, Lindsey Graham, George Pataki\n\n\n\nWhat would you say? - Give us your take on the 2016 Power Index we will share the best and brightest with the whole class.

An enthusiastic group met her moments after she stepped off stage and snapped photos in front of a trailer stacked with hay bales.\u201d\n\n\n\n[Fiorina begins a four-day swing through New Hampshire with a fundraiser in Londonderry, N.H.]\n\n\n\nRubio makes JFK comparison explicit - National Journal: \u201cBut it was a new line he began road-testing in Iowa that stood out. Rubio presented the 2016 campaign as a generational pivot point, likening his vision for a \"New American Century\"\u2014the tagline of his campaign\u2014to Kennedy's 1960 challenge to the nation to embrace a \u2018New Frontier.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\nCruz, Santorum take a pass - Rather than compete with Walker and other top-tier candidates for attention, two candidates with big Iowa aspirations stayed away from Ernst\u2019s event. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz was campaigning in North Carolina and 2012 Iowa winner former Sen. Rick Santorum was in Texas.\n\n\n\n[Watch Fox: Chris Stirewalt joins \u201cThe Real Story\u201d in the 2 p.m. ET hour with the latest on who\u2019s up and who\u2019s down in the 2016 Power Index.]\n\n\n\nJEB HEADS WHERE BUSH FOREIGN POLICY IS AN ASSET\n\nLAT: \u201c[On Tuesday, Jeb Bush begins] an overseas tour to showcase his statesmanship and burnish his foreign policy credentials. This week, he will take a whirlwind spin through the capitals of Germany, Poland and Estonia before officially kicking off his White House bid on June 15. Bush faces an additional, unique test \u2014 differentiating his views from the foreign policies of his father, President George H.W. Bush, and his brother, President George W. Bush.\u201d\n\n\n\n[After going over the border to attend mass in New Hampshire Sunday, Bush is in Maine today for his mother, Barbara Bush\u2019s 90th birthday gala.]\n\n\n\n\u201cMoving Soviet Union to its dissolution so fast without a shot being fired was not as easy as it looked. And solving the budget problem the way he did was not as easy as it looked.

He doesn\u2019t think it's necessary to send U.S. troops now, he said, but he \u2018would not rule out boots on the ground.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s interesting for the president, who called ISIS the \u2018JV squad\u2019 and Yemen a \u2018success story,\u2019 should tell someone to bone up on foreign policy.\u201d \u2013 Gov.

Rick Perryheads to South Carolina today for a tour of the South Carolina military museum. Later he has a town meeting at the U.S.S. Yorktown in Mount Pleasant, S.C. Perry is accompanied by Afghan war hero Marcus Luttrell.\n\n\n\nGraham lets it rip - Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., was pole-axing conservative sacred cows at every turn in an appearance on CNN Sunday. His base bucklers included openness to raising taxes and a call to action on what he says is man-made climate change. But Graham had special enthusiasm for Caitlyn Jenner saying that he couldn\u2019t, \u201cwalk in her shoes,\u201d but wishes her well.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf Caitlyn Jenner wants to be safe and have a prosperous economy, vote for me.

Wrong. The New Yorker takes a look at the origin of rabbit hole and how it has developed from its original meaning into something different entirely. Rabbit hole as Lewis Carroll described in \u201cAlice\u2019s Adventures in Wonderland\u201d meant to fall into a new world or reality. Today, most people use the term as a synonym for a lengthy-distraction like a Netflix binge, or internet search that goes on for hours. There are some modern day versions of Alice\u2019s journey into the rabbit hole, think Twitter, or Reddit, places that take us from our reality into another until we no longer remember how we got there.\n\n\n\nGot a TIP from the RIGHT or the LEFT?

Nah. The Journal reports,\u201c[w]ith the Affordable Care Act in place, Mrs. Clinton isn\u2019t expected to focus on health care, once a signature issue. Nor is she planning a big speech on K-12 education, where her teacher union supporters are at odds with other Democrats who want to increase teacher accountability. Advisers say she also won\u2019t focus on foreign policy in the coming months, perhaps devoting one speech to the subject\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cIf you run a campaign trying to appeal to 60 to 70 percent of the electorate, you\u2019re not going to run a very compelling campaign for the voters you need.\u201d- Former Obama campaign strategist David Plouffe to NYT on Hillary\u2019s campaign strategy.\n\n\n\nMore questions from the foundation - The Clinton Family Foundation, a smaller, charitable entity separate from the Clinton Global Initiative, donated $100,000 to a New York Times charitable fund in 2008, the same year the paper endorsed Hillary Clinton, according to documents obtained by the Washington Free Beacon. The endorsement surprised many due to reports the paper was leaning towards backing then-Sen. Barack Obama.\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s that? - Former Secretary of Labor Robert Reich said Sunday that his former boss President Bill Clinton \u201chas to stop the paid speeches\u201d and start disclosing everything. \u201cShe has got to, and her husband as well, got to just put everything out, Reich told ABC News. \u201cI mean more disclosure than any other candidate.\u201d\n\n\n\n[Fewer CEOs at CGI - The Clinton Global Initiative America conference, hosted Bill Clinton and Chelsea Clinton, kicks off today in Denver.

At the Wisconsin Democratic Party convention on Saturday, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders had an impressive second place showing, finishing with 41 percent of the votes. Clinton won with 49 percent, but failed to get the majority. Out of the 511 delegate votes, Clinton received 252, while Sanders had 208.\u201d\n\n\n\nNader says Hillary a hawk to compensate for gender - Repeat presidential candidate and Corvair foe Ralph Nader told PJMedia in an interview that he believed Clinton had become a militarist because of her gender: \u201cInstead of taking the tradition of women of peace, and turning into a muscular waging of peace of conflict and prevention, she [Clinton] did the reverse\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\n[Clinton has a fundraiser in Bethesda, Maryland today at the home of at the home of Susan Ness.

According to WSB-TV, the townspeople used a backhoe to dig a bigger hole so the bull could safely walk out. While the humans were pleased with their rescue efforts, the bull was not impressed. The 1,500 pound animal named Boy turned out to have been asleep the entire time. When the crew had finished the animal took his sweet time coming to and getting out of his predicament.\n\n\n\nChris Stirewalt is digital politics editor for Fox News.
