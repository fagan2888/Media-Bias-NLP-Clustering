A chocolate company that produces its products "from bean to bar" is relatively rare. More confectioners purchase chocolate to make their goods, but Dan Bieser of Tabal starts with cacao beans.

He imports already-fermented beans from a half-dozen countries, but the bars he makes are from a single source.

"A good fermentation can bring out the natural flavor in the bean," Bieser said.

He roasts the beans, then cracks and winnows the skin from them with a machine he created.

What's left are the cacao nibs. Nibs are half-butter, Bieser said; that butter with tiny bits of cacao in it is called chocolate liquor.

It's combined with more cacao butter, sugar and vanilla in a stone grinder — made of granite — and ground for two to three days, nonstop.

"It just gets super-rich and thick and dark," Bieser said.

Next the mixture goes into a tempering machine, and the temperature is raised, lowered and raised again. Tempering forms the uniform fat and sugar crystals that make a smooth, solid chocolate.

From there, Bieser pours the chocolate into 3-ounce bar molds by hand.

Once cool, it's packaged — again all by hand — and is ready for distribution.

Good chocolate, Bieser said, melts easily in the mouth and has a good, strong snap to it.

With bars made from a single source of chocolate, consumers can taste the differences among beans from different countries. A person might ask him after tasting one, "Did you put cherry in this?"

"No, I didn't," he'll say. "It's the natural flavor of the bean."

"I love that," Bieser said.
