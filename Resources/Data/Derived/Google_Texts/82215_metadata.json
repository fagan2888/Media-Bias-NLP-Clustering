At the last election in 2009, a thumping 14.6-percent result for the FDP allowed Merkel to form a government with the conservatives' traditional allies.\n\n...,/.,", "article_metadata": {"classification": "/FOX NEWS/WORLD/WORLD REGIONS/Europe", "dcterms.modified": "2015-01-06 11:49:40 EST", "dcterms.abstract": "German Chancellor Angela Merkel launches a final week of election campaigning Monday with the wind at her back after a resounding victory for her conservatives in a Bavarian state poll.", "twitter": {"description": "German Chancellor Angela Merkel launches a final week of election campaigning Monday with the wind at her back after a resounding victory for her conservatives in a Bavarian state poll.", "creator": "@foxnews", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/world/2013/09/15/merkel-starts-final-vote-drive-wary-allies-woes.html", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-news/world/2013/09/15/merkel-starts-final-vote-drive-wary-allies-woes/_jcr_content/par/featured-media/media-0.img.jpg/0/0/1449193803170.jpg?ve=1", "title": "Merkel starts final vote drive wary of allies' woes", "site": "@foxnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.publisher": "Fox News", "parsely-metadata": "{\"tags\":[\"/FOX NEWS/WORLD/WORLD REGIONS/Europe\"],\"author\":\"\",\"subSection\":\"world\",\"title\":\"Merkel starts final vote drive wary of allies\\\\u0027 woes\",\"image_url\":\"http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-news/world/2013/09/15/merkel-starts-final-vote-drive-wary-allies-woes/_jcr_content/par/featured-media/media-0.img.jpg/0/0/1449193803170.jpg?ve=1\",\"pub_date\":\"2013-09-16T03:14:24Z\",\"link\":\"http://www.foxnews.com/world/2013/09/15/merkel-starts-final-vote-drive-wary-allies-woes.html\",\"type\":\"article\",\"identifier\":\"eb4a17cd-16ed-4439-87fe-8270dcbbf7e2\",\"section\":\"world\"}", "prism.aggregationType": "subsection", "prism.channel": "fnc", "dc.description": "German Chancellor Angela Merkel launches a final week of election campaigning Monday with the wind at her back after a resounding victory for her conservatives in a Bavarian state poll.", "dc.identifier": "eb4a17cd-16ed-4439-87fe-8270dcbbf7e2", "dc.language": "en-US", "pagetype": "article", "classification-isa": "europe", "description": "German Chancellor Angela Merkel launches a final week of election campaigning Monday with the wind at her back after a resounding victory for her conservatives in a Bavarian state poll.", "prism.section": "world", "fb": {"app_id": 113186182048399}, "dc.source": "AFP", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "dc.title": "Merkel Starts Final Vote Drive Wary Of Allies' Woes", "dcterms.created": "2015-01-06 11:49:40 EST", "og": {"site_name": "Fox News", "description": "German Chancellor Angela Merkel launches a final week of election campaigning Monday with the wind at her back after a resounding victory for her conservatives in a Bavarian state poll.", "title": "Merkel starts final vote drive wary of allies' woes | Fox News", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/world/2013/09/15/merkel-starts-final-vote-drive-wary-allies-woes.html", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-news/world/2013/09/15/merkel-starts-final-vote-drive-wary-allies-woes/_jcr_content/par/featured-media/media-2.img.jpg/0/0/1422632262691.jpg?ve=1", "type": "article"}, "dc.type": "Text.Article", "dc.date": "2013-09-15", "parsely-page": "{\"tags\":[\"/FOX NEWS/WORLD/WORLD REGIONS/Europe\"],\"author\":\"\",\"subSection\":\"world\",\"title\":\"Merkel starts final vote drive wary of allies\\\\u0027 woes\",\"image_url\":\"http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-news/world/2013/09/15/merkel-starts-final-vote-drive-wary-allies-woes/_jcr_content/par/featured-media/media-0.img.jpg/0/0/1449193803170.jpg?ve=1\",\"pub_date\":\"2013-09-16T03:14:24Z\",\"link\":\"http://www.foxnews.com/world/2013/09/15/merkel-starts-final-vote-drive-wary-allies-woes.html\",\"post_id\":\"eb4a17cd-16ed-4439-87fe-8270dcbbf7e2\",\"type\":\"article\",\"section\":\"world\"}"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe277b\"", "article_summary": "News weekly Der Spiegel said on its website Merkel's coalition faced \"sizeable risks\", agreeing that a grand coalition now had stronger odds.\n\"This is the 13th state election in a row in which the centre-right love match failed to win,\" he told public television.\n\"It's now more likely that you will see a grand coalition.\"\nMerkel led a left-right grand coalition during her first four-year term.\nAt the last election in 2009, a thumping 14.6-percent result for the FDP allowed Merkel to form a government with the conservatives' traditional allies."}
