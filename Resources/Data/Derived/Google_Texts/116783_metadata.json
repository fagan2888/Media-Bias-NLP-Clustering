I wonder what they\u2019re saying.\n\nA mass of health care consumers annoyed, confused and stymied by the technical Titanic that is HealthCare.gov have taken to the portal\u2019s associated social media pages to ask questions, log complaints \u2014 even just vent about the program in general.\n\nIt\u2019s a highly negative and telling visual of the program\u2019s systemic failure in handling customers out of the gate, no matter the circumstances that the administration has cited to date.\n\n\u201cHow is it that Facebook, which is a non-essential social networking web site, can reliably handle BILLIONS of electronic interactions per second, but the Healthcare.gov site, which is literally the very heart of the Obamacare program, wasn\u2019t ready for the obvious millions of visitors that you had to know it would be receiving?\u201d one Facebook user asked.\n\nThis goes without mentioning the stream of tweets directed at the @HealthCareGov handle, many of which complained about the website\u2019s lacking functionality.\n\n@HealthCareGov Day 7 Login failure attempt #54 \"Downstream error\" #healthcare pic.twitter.com/ADi4wbwa5Z \u2014 Ben Robertson (@BenHRobertson) October 7, 2013\n\n@BarackObama @HealthCareGov THIS IS THE WORST SYSTEM EVER!!!
