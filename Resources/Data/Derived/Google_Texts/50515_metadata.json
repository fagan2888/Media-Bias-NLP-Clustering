From the 1930s on, the League's interest in clean water expanded to include environmental action on all fronts , including fighting attempts to weaken environmental protections and pushing for strong environmental safeguards in the reauthorization of the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act. Today, League supporters across the country actively campaign to urge the President and Congress to lead the world in the fight against climate change , including supporting the President's Climate Action Plan and opposing the construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline .\n\nSince 1920, the League has provided millions of voters with nonpartisan voter education information . In 2014, Leagues held nearly 600 candidate debates and forums and published hundreds of voters' guides covering over 20,000 candidates and 14,000 races. Millions of voters have visited VOTE411.org , the League's go-to online resource, to get the information they need to register to vote, find localized election-related information, and get ready to head to the polls.\n\nWe've accomplished a lot in the last 95 years, but there remains more to be done to ensure a better future for all Americans. As the League approaches its 100th anniversary, we're committed to stepping up our work to register more new voters and help all eligible voters participate in our electoral process. We'll also keep pushing for necessary legislation and regulations at the state and federal levels to protect our planet for future generations, keep secret money out of our elections and ensure that our elections are free, fair and accessible for all voters. Want to help make it happen? Join us in the fight.", "article_metadata": {"description": "This year, the League of Women Voters celebrates our", "sailthru.expire_date": "2015-02-14 16:42:46 -0500", "og": {"url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/elisabeth-macnamara/6-ways-the-league-of-wome_b_6681058.html", "locale": "en_US", "site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "This year, the League of Women Voters celebrates our", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"width": 2000, "height": 1000}, "creator": "lwv", "site": "@HuffPostImpact", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "This year, the League of Women Voters celebrates our"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-02-13 16:42:46 -0500", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=6681058", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "impact", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "league of women voters,voting,Voting Rights,Voting Rights Act,Climate change,voter discrimination,Voter suppression,voter ID laws,voter ID,voter photo ID laws,global warming,Campaign Finance,money in politics,mccain-feingold,elections,register to vote,voter registration,healthcare,healthcare reform,obamacare,prochoice,reproductive rights,Affordable Care Act,women's rights", "article": {"section": "Impact", "tag": "league of women voters,voting,Voting Rights,Voting Rights Act,Climate change,voter discrimination,Voter suppression,voter ID laws,voter ID,voter photo ID laws,global warming,Campaign Finance,money in politics,mccain-feingold,elections,register to vote,voter registration,healthcare,healthcare reform,obamacare,prochoice,reproductive rights,Affordable Care Act,women's rights", "published_time": "2015-02-13 16:42:46 -0500", "modified_time": "2015-04-15 05:59:02 -0400"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd64e\"", "article_summary": "As the League approaches its 100th anniversary, we're committed to stepping up our work to register more new voters and help all eligible voters participate in our electoral process.\nSince 1920, the League has provided millions of voters with nonpartisan voter education information .\nIn 2014, Leagues held nearly 600 candidate debates and forums and published hundreds of voters' guides covering over 20,000 candidates and 14,000 races.\nClimate change is the greatest environmental challenge of our generation.\nFrom the 1930s on, the League's interest in clean water expanded to include environmental action on all fronts , including fighting attempts to weaken environmental protections and pushing for strong environmental safeguards in the reauthorization of the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act."}
