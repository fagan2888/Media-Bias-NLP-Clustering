I\u2019m not, and it\u2019s making me feel a little left out at work. What\u2019s all this talk about yellow cards?\n\nThroughout the year in my office, whoops and groans erupt during assorted big games in a variety of sports \u2014 made worse by the fact that I\u2019m on same floor as the sports department. I end up feeling the way I did when I was little and could hear my parents and siblings laughing in another room: What am I missing?\n\nI wish I could feel that I belonged. Maybe next year, I should place a serious bet in the office March Madness pool. That way, despite my lack of interest in basketball, I might truly come to care whether Connecticut beats Kentucky.\n\nBonding at work over sports can heighten collegiality, and that can leave women at a disadvantage, said Raina A. Brands, an assistant professor at the London Business School who studies workplace interactions.\n\nIt\u2019s true that many women play sports and enjoy watching them, but the sports that people watch and discuss at work \u2014 like the World Cup matches \u2014 tend to be played by all-male teams, she said. (Some Olympic sports are among the heartening exceptions.) As she sees it, the conversations men have with other men when they watch men playing sports lead to \u201cboundary heightening\u201d behavior that can exclude women. As a result, she said, women may be \u201clocked out of the boisterous, informal exchanges that are essential to organizational life.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIt\u2019s not that the average man is thinking \u201cI\u2019ll use this to muscle out the women,\u201d but it can still have that effect, she added.\n\nThe exclusion can extend to sports jargon, she said. Jargon \u201chelps us coordinate our tasks and solve problems that we do regularly, but it also signals insiders and outsiders,\u201d she said. Sports idioms tied to work can be vivid and powerful for men, and less so for women, she said.\n\nOne day at a previous job, I came in sick because I needed to meet an important deadline. \u201cYou\u2019re playin\u2019 hurt,\u201d my jock-type boss said approvingly. He had to explain what he meant: I was like an athlete who plays through the pain of an injury.\n\nNow, the idea that I was even in a small way similar to Jack Youngblood of the Los Angeles Rams, who played in the 1980 Super Bowl with a broken leg, was laughable. And, frankly, I think a lot of former football players would be healthier if they had stayed home more and nursed their injuries. But my point is that these sports metaphors can go over a lot of people\u2019s \u2014 and especially women\u2019s \u2014 heads.\n\nFor a long time, for example, I was mystified by the expression \u201ctake it to the mat,\u201d used more than once by my male colleagues. When I finally learned that it comes from wrestling and means taking an aggressive stance in a disagreement, I thought: My way of handling conflicts doesn\u2019t really resemble that of a wrestler facing off against an opponent.\n\nBut even I appreciate many sports idioms. I\u2019m from Minnesota, and when the Twins were on the way to winning the World Series in 1987 and 1991, I did become desperately interested in baseball, thrilled to see Kent Hrbek and Brian Harper execute a bases-loaded double play, Dan Gladden hit a grand slam, and Kirby Puckett hit a home run in the bottom of the 11th.\n\nBecause of that, I still enjoy the occasional baseball game. And sometimes, when a reporter turns in a great story, I have been known to say that he or she \u201cknocked it out of the park.\u201d The sure crack of the bat, the ball sailing over the stands, the player who needs only to trot, not sprint, around the bases \u2014 these conjure perfectly the feeling I have during certain successful moments at work.\n\nSo I understand that sports metaphors can be inspiring. In school, I was the proverbial last person picked for the team, but playing on a sports team can transform some people\u2019s lives. Business executives talk about the importance of sports all the time. Working with others toward a common goal and stretching yourself to your limits \u2014 these are compelling ideas. That\u2019s why the idea of a sports team can have such resonance at work.\n\nBut when leaders try to motivate their teams with sports analogies, what kind of team are they really talking about? An Olympic relay team that succeeds through cooperation? Or a hockey team that likes to indulge in the occasional brawl? Sometimes sports metaphors in the workplace (when people are urged to play hardball, say, or to pull no punches) bring to mind an aggressiveness that may not sit well with some women \u2014 and men.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nYes, it\u2019s just jargon, and it\u2019s not meant to be taken literally. But let\u2019s not drop the ball here: As we swing for the fences at work, let\u2019s try to level the playing field by at least being sensitive to the hidden meanings of some of the sports metaphors we use. Maybe we can search our playbooks to find a different kind of workplace analogy, for the win.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140621101002, "twitter": {"description": "Sports talk in the workplace, whether about the World Cup or the World Series, can exclude and alienate some employees.", "title": "Again at the Office, I\u2019m a Player Without a Team", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/22/jobs/workstation-again-at-the-office-im-a-player-without-a-team.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002953283"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "creator": "phylliskorkki", "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/06/22/business/22-WORKSTATIONSUB/22-WORKSTATIONSUB-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/22/jobs/workstation-again-at-the-office-im-a-player-without-a-team.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002953283", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/22/jobs/workstation-again-at-the-office-im-a-player-without-a-team.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "jobs", "channels": "NytNow", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/jobs/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "June 21, 2014", "edt": "NewYork", "keywords": "Workplace Environment,World Cup (Soccer),Athletics and Sports,Women and Girls,Soccer", "news_keywords": "Soccer", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Phyllis Korkki", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/06/22/business/22-WORKSTATIONSUB/22-WORKSTATIONSUB-thumbLarge.jpg", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "byl": "By PHYLLIS KORKKI", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "Sports talk in the workplace, whether about the World Cup or the World Series, can exclude and alienate some employees.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "CT": "column", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/06/22/business/22-WORKSTATIONSUB/22-WORKSTATIONSUB-thumbStandard.jpg", "description": "Sports talk in the workplace, whether about the World Cup or the World Series, can exclude and alienate some employees.", "CN": "business-workstation", "CG": "jobs", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "June 21, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/jobs/index.html", "section": "Job Market", "modified": "2015-02-11", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/jobs/index.jsonp", "tag": "Soccer", "published": "2014-06-21", "section-taxonomy-id": "D2CC9565-209C-4B30-8247-030DB7A0228E"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "slug": "22workstation", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20150211175818, "hdl_p": "Again, I\u2019m a Player Without a Team", "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/22/jobs/workstation-again-at-the-office-im-a-player-without-a-team.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/06/22/business/22-WORKSTATIONSUB/22-WORKSTATIONSUB-videoSixteenByNine1050.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Sports talk in the workplace, whether about the World Cup or the World Series, can exclude and alienate some employees.", "title": "Again at the Office, I\u2019m a Player Without a Team"}, "pdate": 20140621, "des": "Soccer", "nyt-collection": {"tone": "feature", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/column/business-workstation", "tagline": "A collection of \u201cWorkstation\u201d columns published in The New York Times.", "uri": "/column/business-workstation", "display-name": "Workstation", "identifier": "business-workstation", "type": "column"}, "articleid": 100000002953283, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Again at the Office, I\u2019m a Player Without a Team", "col": "Workstation", "PST": "News"}, "article_summary": "In school, I was the proverbial last person picked for the team, but playing on a sports team can transform some people\u2019s lives.\nAs she sees it, the conversations men have with other men when they watch men playing sports lead to \u201cboundary heightening\u201d behavior that can exclude women.\nBut when leaders try to motivate their teams with sports analogies, what kind of team are they really talking about?\nMaybe next year, I should place a serious bet in the office March Madness pool.\nThat\u2019s why the idea of a sports team can have such resonance at work."}
