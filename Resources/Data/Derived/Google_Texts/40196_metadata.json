The Vikings likely won\u2019t have Peterson for the rest of the season, which could make Zimmer\u2019s first year as an NFL head coach a rocky one.\n\n\u201cMike Zimmer is as tough a guy as I\u2019ve ever met,\u201d Jon Gruden told the Pioneer Press. \u201cHe\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\n\nGruden, now an ESPN analyst, won a Super Bowl with Tampa Bay after the 2002 season. Brian Billick, who won a Super Bowl with Baltimore two years earlier and is a former Vikings assistant, echoed Gruden\u2019s sentiments.\n\n\u201cMike Zimmer is a good coach,\u201d Billick said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a tough road ahead, but he can overcome this challenge.\u201d\n\nGruden pointed to adversity Zimmer has had in the past, including his wife Vikki dying unexpectedly in 2009 of natural causes. Zimmer brought up his wife\u2019s death on his own during a news conference Friday.\n\n\u201cMy wife died in October, five years ago. \u2026 So I\u2019ve been through a lot,\u201d Zimmer said.\n\nMinnesota (1-1) plays Sunday at New Orleans (0-2) after losing 30-7 last weekend to New England without Peterson. After the Vikings reactivated Peterson on Monday, the team faced tremendous criticism and reversed course Wednesday.\n\nZimmer was an NFL assistant for 20 years, 14 as a defensive coordinator, before joining the Vikings. The offensive-minded Gruden coached against Zimmer defenses for more 15 years as an assistant and head coach.\n\n\u201cMike\u2019s had adversity before and he\u2019s battled obstacles not only in his coaching career but in his life,\u201d said Gruden, Oakland\u2019s coach from 1998-2001 and Tampa Bay\u2019s from 2002-08. \u201cHe has a lot of experience. When adversity strikes, life goes on. Mike Zimmer knows that, and he\u2019ll have his team well prepared.\u201d\n\nBillick, now an NFL Network analyst, was a Vikings offensive assistant from 1992-98, which included going against Zimmer defenses. He also faced Zimmer teams as the Ravens\u2019 head coach from 1999-2007.\n\n\u201cMike\u2019s been through his share of difficult things in the NFL,\u201d Billick said. \u201cIn Cincinnati, he had a lot of things that happened. In Dallas, it was a three-ring circus. So he\u2019s got a background of what to do when there\u2019s adversity.\u201d\n\nWhen Zimmer was with the Cowboys from 1994-2006, there were a number of issues, including the 1996 arrest of star receiver Michael Irvin on a charge of cocaine possession and the 2006 alleged suicide attempt by star receiver Terrell Owens.\n\nWhen Zimmer was with the Bengals from 2008-13, there were a number of arrests and the 2009 death of wide receiver Chris Henry.\n\n\u201cBeing in the NFL for 21 years, you see a lot of different things,\u201d Zimmer said. \u201cI just try and do the best job I can each and every day, each and every week. We try to think about this going forward for the long term of the organization, try and coach them as hard as we can \u2026 It wouldn\u2019t look very good if I wasn\u2019t a tough guy, too.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "sports,pro,Vikings,NFL", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Jamestown Sun", "description": "MINNEAPOLIS \u2014 A pair of Super Bowl-winning coaches said Friday that Mike Zimmer is the right coach to get the Vikings through this Adrian Peterson mess.\r\nThe former MVP running back was put on the NFL\u2019s exempt list Wednesday after being indicted last week in Texas on a charge of child abuse.
