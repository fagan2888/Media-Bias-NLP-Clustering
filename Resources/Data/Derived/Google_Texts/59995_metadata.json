Tim Kaine, D-Va., says it\u2019s way past time for Congress to formally authorize military force to press America\u2019s war against the Islamic State, the terrorist group also known as ISIS.\n\nIt\u2019s been 17 months since the United States officially has engaged in battle, Kaine said, arguing for a new Authorization for Use of Military Force, or AUMF, to replace the existing one from 2001.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we should have America at war without a vote of Congress,\u201d Kaine said in an interview with The Daily Signal conducted the day before a Muslim man and his wife shot 14 to death and wounded 21 others in San Bernardino, Calif.\n\n>>> Related: A Framework for an Authorization for Use of Military Force\n\nThe Virginia Democrat and his Republican counterpart from Arizona, Sen. Jeff Flake, introduced their version of an AUMF in June. Since then, they have pressed colleagues on both sides of the aisle to call for a vote on it.\n\nIn the wake of the ISIS-affiliated attacks Nov. 13 in Paris, Kaine said he was hopeful that fellow senators will take a second look:\n\nI hope we\u2019ll get to the point where Congress will do their job. We shouldn\u2019t just be doing this on a presidential say-so. Congress should put our thumbprint on this mission so that our allies know where Congress stands, ISIL [or ISIS] knows where our Congress stands, but especially our troops know that we\u2019re behind them.\n\nLeaders of both parties don\u2019t appear to be motivated to have their members take a tough vote when the Obama administration already is carrying out military action against ISIS.\n\nSome conservatives make a policy argument for why Congress could decide that a new authorization of military force isn\u2019t necessary, as the administration has in the past, because the Islamic State sprang from al-Qaeda.\n\nCharles \u201cCully\u201d Stimson, manager of The Heritage Foundation\u2019s National Security Law Program, writes:\n\nFirst and foremost, Congress must closely analyze whether ISIS could fall under the 2001 AUMF. In other words, given the historical ties between ISIS and al-Qaeda, do they fit into the narrow class of targets that fall under the 2001 AUMF? If they do, as a legal matter, there may be no need for a stand-alone congressional authorization for use of force against ISIS.\n\nIf Congress does decide on a new authorization, Stimson writes, it should tailor the document to the Islamic State in methods, target, purpose, and timing.\n\n\u201cAn authorization for use of military force is not a substitute for a comprehensive strategy to confront and defeat an enemy, whether the enemy is a state actor (i.e., a country) or a non-state actor, such as a terrorist organization,\u201d Stimson writes.\n\nWidespread disagreement exists about just how far-reaching a new authorization of military force should be. The wording so far has been tricky, but Kaine said politics needs to be pushed aside on such a fundamental issue:\n\nThe reason you don\u2019t want to be at war without a vote of Congress is pretty important. It\u2019s not just because it\u2019s in the Constitution. A war means you\u2019re ordering people to risk their lives[.] \u2026 [B]efore you force them to do that, you ought to at least have a debate and say, \u2018We think this is in the national interest.\u2019 That\u2019s what the vote of Congress does. The debate educates the American public about the stakes, and then, when Congress votes, it\u2019s like you\u2019re putting your thumb on this mission: This is in the national interest, you volunteered for the military, so now you\u2019re going to be deployed.\n\n>>> Watch: The Legal Basis for Military Action Against ISIS\n\nKen McIntyre contributed to this article.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"I hope we\u2019ll get to the point where Congress will do their job.
