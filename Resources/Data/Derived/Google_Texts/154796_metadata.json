The agency has been accused of singling out conservative-leaning groups that applied for tax-exempt status, thereby making it difficult for them to organize opposition to President Obama and other Democratic candidates.\n\nRelated: IRS Had No Process to Stop the Targeting of Conservative Groups\n\nKoskinen was not at the agency when the targeting took place; he took over the agency in December of 2013 in the middle of the investigation that focused on the emails sent and received by Lois Lerner, the former director of the department in charge of tax-exemption rulings.\n\nA former corporate turnaround specialist who came to government service after decades in the private sector, Koskinen was brought in to put a new face on an agency long at odds with the GOP Congress. However, after a brief interlude of kind words and expressions of hope, Koskinen quickly found himself in the committee\u2019s crosshairs when the agency\u2019s multiple missteps in handling the production of Lerner\u2019s emails \u2013 including the destruction of computer backup tapes \u2013 became public.\n\nMembers of the committee believe that Koskinen knowingly misled them when he testified that the agency had made every effort to secure Lerner\u2019s emails, and on Monday the members\u2019 frustrations seem to have boiled over.\n\nRep. Jason Chaffetz (R-UT), the committee head, held a press conference that featured a 10-minute, professionally produced video outlining the committee\u2019s case for calling for Koskinen\u2019s removal. He followed that up by presenting a 30-page letter to the president, signed by himself and 20 other members of the committee, detailing their complaints against the IRS head.\n\nRelated: IRS Admits Targeting Conservatives for Tax Scrutiny in 2012 Election\n\n\u201cMr. Koskinen should no longer be the IRS Commissioner,\u201d Chaffetz said. \u201cWe have asked the President to remove Mr. Koskinen from office.\n\nHe added, \u201cWe will pursue all constitutional remedies at our disposal, including potential contempt proceedings or perhaps impeachment of Commissioner Koskinen.\u201d\n\nWere the House to move forward with a contempt citation it would be a rarity, but by no means a first. In fact, it wouldn\u2019t even be the first contempt citation in the targeting scandal. The House voted to hold Lois Lerner in contempt last year for her refusal to testify on the scandal.\n\n(The House vote to hold then-Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt in 2012 was notable because it was the first and only time a sitting cabinet-level official had been found in contempt.)\n\nRelated: Treasury IG Finds IRS Destroyed More Lerner Emails\n\nA contempt charge is not just a formality, either. If either the full House or full Senate finds someone in contempt, the chamber\u2019s presiding officer then presents the contempt finding to the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia, who is obligated to bring the issue before a grand jury. An individual found guilty of contempt is liable to spend up to a year in jail, and faces a fine of up to $1,000.\n\nContacted Tuesday morning, the IRS did not immediately offer a statement on the letter.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "After more than a year and a half of increasingly bitter battles with the Internal Revenue Service over the alleged targeting of conservative non-profits, the House Oversight Committee has apparently had enough.", "title": "House to Obama: Fire the Head of the IRS or We\u2019ll Impeach Him", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/07/28/House-Obama-Fire-Head-IRS-or-We-ll-Impeach-Him", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/05162013_IRS_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/07/28/House-Obama-Fire-Head-IRS-or-We-ll-Impeach-Him", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/05162013_IRS_article.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "After more than a year and a half of increasingly bitter battles with the Internal Revenue Service over the alleged targeting of conservative non-profits, the House Oversight Committee has apparently had enough.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "The House voted to hold Lois Lerner in contempt last year for her refusal to testify on the scandal.\nRelated: Treasury IG Finds IRS Destroyed More Lerner EmailsA contempt charge is not just a formality, either.\nThe Oversight Committee has since 2013 been investigating the targeting of conservative groups by the IRS in the year prior to the 2012 presidential election.\nHe followed that up by presenting a 30-page letter to the president, signed by himself and 20 other members of the committee, detailing their complaints against the IRS head.\nRelated: IRS Admits Targeting Conservatives for Tax Scrutiny in 2012 Election\u201cMr."}
