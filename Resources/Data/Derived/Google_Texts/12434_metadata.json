Most other New Jersey hospitals treated a higher number of impoverished patients, the report found.\n\n\n\nBergen Regional Medical Center, in Paramus, reported providing nearly $6.2 million less in charity care in 2012 than in 2011. By contrast, St. Joseph\u2019s Regional Medical Center in Paterson had the highest amount of charity care in the state, nearly $83 million.\n\n\n\nExecutives at the for-profit company running the hospital declined to comment on the drop. So did Robert Garrison, the executive director of the Bergen County Improvement Authority, which oversees the hospital.\n\n\n\nOverall, hospitals statewide spent $998 million in charity care last year, up from $995 million in 2011 but a drop from the $1 billion they reported in 2010. Hospitals\u2019 obligation to provide nonemergency care to the poor is a murky area of the law.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat this says is that a significant amount of uninsured patients in the State of New Jersey are being treated,\u201d said Sean Hopkins, vice president for health economics of the New Jersey Hospital Association. \u201cIn the grand scheme of things, it looks like there was a significant increase in charity care during the great recession starting about 2008 and then after that it started to flatten out.\u201d\n\n\n\nAt least one North Jersey hospital has been trying to reduce its charity-care cases. Holy Name Medical Center in Teaneck attributes its nearly $1 million reduction in charity cases in 2012 to an effort, begun in 2010. The Catholic-based hospital hired additional staff and \u201cemployed an improved process to qualify patients for Medicaid \u2014 thus decreasing the charity care number in 2012,\u201d said Jane Ellis, a hospital vice president. \u201cThe result has been a win-win for both Holy Name and those former charity-care patients who are now covered by Medicaid.\u201d\n\n\n\nSeveral other medical centers also had a decline in charity care, but Bergen Regional had the largest drop among North Jersey hospitals. In 2010, the county-owned hospital reported nearly $42.7 million in charity care. By 2011, that number had dropped to $39 million and in 2012 it had slipped to nearly $32.8 million.\n\n\n\nTracy Zur, the freeholder liaison to the hospital, said \u201cBergen Regional is our safety-net hospital and has a duty and responsibility to provide care for the most needy in our community,\u201d referring to the hospital\u2019s long history of caring for the poor. \u201cThis substantiates what we\u2019ve been hearing \u2014 that they aren\u2019t meeting their responsibility, and this is unacceptable.\u201d\n\n\n\nMeadowlands Hospital in Secaucus, which is now a for-profit institution, reduced charity-care work by only about $10,000 between 2011 and 2012. But the previous owners reported spending $2.1 million in 2010, just over $500,000 more than the 2012 amount, , on indigent patients.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t speak to the 2010 numbers, because we can\u2019t talk about numbers that were submitted by other people,\u201d said Ben Martin, a spokesman for the hospital. But he said that the difference between the 2011 and 2012 numbers was \u201creally statistically insignificant.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdministrators at St. Mary\u2019s in Passaic declined to comment on the hospital\u2019s $1 million reduction between 2011 and 2012 and the $5 million drop from 2010.\n\n\n\nSt. Joseph administrators also did not comment on the $8 million increase from 2011 to 2012.\n\n\n\n\u201cKeep in mind that charity care is reimbursed based on Medicaid rates, which is about 30 percent below the cost of care,\u201d said Hopkins, of the hospital association.\n\n\n\nThe state awarded $675 million in charity care to be divided among the New Jersey hospitals in 2012 to help reimburse charity-care costs.\n\n\n\nHospital administrators are hoping that implementation of the Affordable Care Act, which is expected to cover a large portion of New Jersey\u2019s 900,000 uninsured, will reduce the number of charity-care patients.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail: williamsb@northjersey.com\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "description": "Bergen Regional Medical Center, in Paramus, reported providing nearly $6.2 million less in charity care in 2012 than in 2011.", "copyright": "North Jersey Media Group Inc.", "author": "BARBARA WILLIAMS", "og": {"url": "http://www.northjersey.com/cm/2.1593/news/charity-care-decreases-by-6-2m-at-bergen-regional-medical-center-in-paramus-1.626480", "site_name": "NorthJersey.com", "image": "http://www.northjersey.com/designimages/NorthJerseyFacebook_377x196.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Bergen Regional Medical Center, in Paramus, reported providing nearly $6.2 million less in charity care in 2012 than in 2011."}, "title": "Charity care decreases by $6.2M at Bergen Regional Medical Center in Paramus", "robots": "noarchive,noodp,noydir", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=446490632", "fb": {"admins": "100002050123125,739916158,1235266096", "app_id": 130358300392751}, "DC.creator": "BARBARA WILLIAMS", "msvalidate.01": "697A26605161B513EFE2AD6E581F4AA8", "google-site-verification": "swyvR_LXSGMOxOz1638gujs38OoVP3sZwJgdjySjnXM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=2.0, user-scalable=yes", "DC.title": "Charity care decreases by $6.2M at Bergen Regional Medical Center in Paramus"}, "article_summary": "Bergen Regional Medical Center, in Paramus, reported providing nearly $6.2 million less in charity care in 2012 than in 2011.\nBy contrast, St. Joseph\u2019s Regional Medical Center in Paterson had the highest amount of charity care in the state, nearly $83 million.\nThe state awarded $675 million in charity care to be divided among the New Jersey hospitals in 2012 to help reimburse charity-care costs.\n\u201cKeep in mind that charity care is reimbursed based on Medicaid rates, which is about 30 percent below the cost of care,\u201d said Hopkins, of the hospital association.\nIn 2010, the county-owned hospital reported nearly $42.7 million in charity care."}
