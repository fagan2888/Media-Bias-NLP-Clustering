The surcharge would affect salaried professionals, like lawyers and accountants, while excluding those whose income comes from industries that produce goods, like manufacturing and farming.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe current top tax rate for individuals is 39.6 percent. Under the new plan, the seven existing tax brackets would be collapsed into just two \u2014 at 10 percent and 25 percent, according to congressional aides\n\nSenator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, agreed with Mr. McConnell\u2019s assessment that a tax overhaul will be difficult to push through Congress this year, but he blamed Republicans for the impasse.\n\n\u201cThe truth is, we should have tackled tax reform years ago,\u201d Mr. Reid said Tuesday. \u201cIt will be extremely difficult \u2014 with the obstruction that we get here from the Republicans on virtually everything \u2014 to do something that should have been done years ago.\u201d\n\nBut he praised Mr. Camp for \u201ccoming forward with a piece of legislation.\u201d\n\nMr. Camp said nonpartisan economists at the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation had estimated that streamlining the tax code would increase the size of the economy by $3.4 trillion over the next decade. \u201cThis will lead to nearly two million new jobs \u2014 and producing up to $700 billion in additional federal revenues,\u201d he wrote in an op-ed article published online Tuesday night by The Wall Street Journal.\n\nPhoto\n\nHe went on to predict that families at the median income level \u2014 $51,000 for a family of four \u2014 would \u201chave on average an extra $1,300 in their pocket at the end of the year.\u201d\n\nMr. Camp is also set on Wednesday to shepherd a bill through the House that would stop new Internal Revenue Service regulations of political \u201csocial welfare\u201d groups. That underscores a quandary facing House Republican leaders as they head into the midterm elections: Should they limit their agenda to political bills tailored to aid Republican campaigns like the I.R.S. bill, or should they take big risks on ambitious policy proposals, like simplifying the tax code?\n\nIntraparty controversies were precisely what Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio had hoped to avoid this year when he shelved a broad immigration push, then whisked through an increase in the debt ceiling, relying almost entirely on Democratic votes.\n\nEven those who believe that Mr. Camp\u2019s proposal has little chance this year say that his so-called discussion draft will serve as a test of support among fellow Republicans who favor tax changes in theory but often balk at the trade-offs required. Those Republicans are especially hesitant to act on a bill that is unlikely to make it through the Senate, which is controlled by Democrats. If Mr. Camp\u2019s plan fails to attract a Republican majority, it is coming early enough in the year that it is unlikely to have lasting ramifications in the midterm elections.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHouse leadership aides told Mr. Camp in November that he needed to find a Democratic partner other than Senator Max Baucus of Montana, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee at the time, who had been working with Mr. Camp on a tax code overhaul. But Mr. Camp failed to do so \u2014 and now Mr. Baucus is ambassador to China. Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, now leads the Finance Committee.\n\nDemocrats are expressing their frustration with how the tax plan is being rolled out. Democratic aides say that unlike their Republican colleagues on the Ways and Means Committee, Democrats have not been briefed on any of the plan\u2019s details, and they did not receive a letter that went out to all the Republican members last week alerting them of the draft legislation to be released on Wednesday.\n\nIn addition to the I.R.S. legislation \u2014 part of the House Republicans\u2019 \u201cStop Government Abuse\u201d push this week \u2014 Democrats pointed to the Ways and Means Committee\u2019s focus in recent months on the Affordable Care Act as a sign of the panel\u2019s partisan approach. The last full committee hearing on any topic other than the health care law, they added, was in July.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a real contrast here,\u201d said Representative Sander M. Levin of Michigan, the ranking Democrat on the Ways and Means Committee. \u201cOn the one hand, Dave\u2019s acting as chairman of Ways and Means, putting out a tax reform bill. On the other hand, he acts like chairman of the Republican campaign effort.\u201d\n\nMr. Camp has been working to shore up support with business groups like the Alliance for Competitive Taxation.\n\n\u201cWe think Chairman Camp\u2019s discussion draft will provide a real boost to the tax reform discussions,\u201d said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office and an economic adviser to the Alliance for Competitive Taxation.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140225140342, "twitter": {"description": "A proposal by Dave Camp of Michigan, the top Republican on the House Ways and Means Committee, to simplify the tax code is coming under scrutiny from fellow Republicans.", "creator": "AshleyRParker", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/26/us/politics/gop-tax-plan-seeks-cuts-in-rates-and-number-of-brackets.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002734056"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "title": "Tax Overhaul Plan Faces Key Hurdles", "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/02/26/us/TAXES/TAXES-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/26/us/politics/gop-tax-plan-seeks-cuts-in-rates-and-number-of-brackets.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002734056", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/26/us/politics/gop-tax-plan-seeks-cuts-in-rates-and-number-of-brackets.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "us/politics", "hdl_p": "Tax Overhaul Plan Faces Key Hurdles", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/politics/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Feb. 25, 2014", "edt": "NewYork", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/p/ashley_parker/index.html", "section": "Politics", "modified": "2014-02-27", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/politics/index.jsonp", "tag": "United States Politics and Government", "published": "2014-02-25", "section-taxonomy-id": "23FD6C8B-62D5-4CEA-A331-6C2A9A1223BE"}, "keywords": "House Committee on Ways and Means,Camp  David L,Income Tax,Corporate Taxes,Republican Party,Federal Taxes (US),Senate,House of Representatives,Taxation,United States Politics and Government", "description": "A proposal by Dave Camp of Michigan, the top Republican on the House Ways and Means Committee, to simplify the tax code is coming under scrutiny from fellow Republicans.", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Ashley Parker", "SCG": "politics", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "per": "Camp, David L", "slug": "26taxes", "byl": "By ASHLEY PARKER", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "A proposal by Dave Camp of Michigan, the top Republican on the House Ways and Means Committee, to simplify the tax code is coming under scrutiny from fellow Republicans.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/02/26/us/TAXES/TAXES-thumbStandard.jpg", "news_keywords": "Senate,Tax", "CG": "us", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Feb. 25, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "org": "House of Representatives", "thumbnail_height": 75, "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20140227123641, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/26/us/politics/gop-tax-plan-seeks-cuts-in-rates-and-number-of-brackets.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/02/26/us/TAXES/TAXES-videoSixteenByNine1050.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "A proposal by Dave Camp of Michigan, the top Republican on the House Ways and Means Committee, to simplify the tax code is coming under scrutiny from fellow Republicans.", "title": "Tax Overhaul Plan Faces Key Hurdles"}, "pdate": 20140225, "des": "United States Politics and Government", "articleid": 100000002734056, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Tax Overhaul Plan Faces Key Hurdles", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/02/26/us/TAXES/TAXES-thumbLarge.jpg", "PST": "News"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9510\"", "article_summary": "Democrats are expressing their frustration with how the tax plan is being rolled out.\nBut Mr. Camp failed to do so \u2014 and now Mr. Baucus is ambassador to China.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a real contrast here,\u201d said Representative Sander M.
