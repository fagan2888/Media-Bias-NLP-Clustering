Border authorities encountered more than 24,000 in fiscal year 2013, and more than 38,000 last year.\n\nThe DHS ad also specifies that any contractor making a bid for the job should have \u201cpersonnel who are able to communicate with juveniles in their own designated languages,\u201d and specifies that \u201cthere will be approximately 65,000 UAC in total: 25 percent local ground transport, 25 percent via ICE charter and 50 percent via commercial air.\u201d\n\nSince that solicitation, Homeland Security officials have upped their prediction and now estimate more than 90,000 unaccompanied children will be apprehended this year.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Obama administration say they were caught off-guard by the sheer number of illegal children who've crossed into America in recent days, but an employment ad from the Department of Homeland Security may prove otherwise.", "Author": "Cheryl K.
