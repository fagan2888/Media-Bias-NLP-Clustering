Castle Rock voters have taken away the town manager’s power to restrict the open carry of firearms in public buildings and parks, while insisting that any future decisions on gun restrictions in town of 50,000 go to a vote of the people.

The final results of Castle Rock’s Aug. 19 special election were announced Thursday afternoon, after 10 days of counting ballots.

Referendum A, which asked whether the town manager should lose the authority to ban the open carry of firearms in public buildings and parks, squeaked by — 50.8 percent to 49.2 percent (4,737 votes to 4,586).

Referendum B, which asked whether future firearms restrictions in Castle Rock should be decided by voters, passed easily — 78 percent to 28 percent (6,610 to 2,679).

Town attorney Bob Slentz said that if the vote totals are certified, people would be able to visibly carry firearms in public spaces, with the exception of schools and courts.

He said it isn’t certain when the restrictions might be lifted, given the possibility of a recount of the results and a lawsuit that is still pending concerning the way the town processed the all-mail ballots.

The issue first came to a head in January, after the Town Council voted 4-3 to ease the town’s open-carry restrictions, which had been in effect since 2003.

A group of citizens challenged the council decision by collecting signatures to place the measures on the ballot.

The issue has proved controversial in the past few months, with groups on both sides of the gun-control debate facing off against each other in public. The election itself triggered two lawsuits — one challenging the ballot-counting process and the other failing in its attempt this week to get a judge to halt the vote counting.
