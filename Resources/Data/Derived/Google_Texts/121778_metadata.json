The poor, she said, should rely on churches and charitable organizations for help.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking at Obamacare right now,\u201d Ernst said. \u201cOnce we start with those benefits in January, how are we going to get people off of those? It\u2019s exponentially harder to remove people once they\u2019ve already been on those programs.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have lost a reliance on not only our own families, but so much of what our churches and private organizations used to do,\u201d she went on. \u201cThey used to have wonderful food pantries. They used to provide clothing for those that really needed it, but we have gotten away from that. Now we\u2019re at a point where the government will just give away anything. We have to stop that.\u201d\n\nJonathan Chait at New York magazine wrote, \u201cThat\u2019s the fundamental belief that motivates most, if not all, the conservative opposition: Health care should be a privilege rather than a right. If you can\u2019t afford health insurance on your own, that is not the government\u2019s problem.\u201d\n\nErnst is running to fill the seat being vacated by outgoing Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin, who announced earlier this year that he is not seeking re-election.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://www.rawstory.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Joni-Ernst-via-Facebook-800x430.png", "height": 430}, "title": "Iowa\u2019s Joni Ernst: Obamacare is bad because people should rely on churches for help"}, "fb": {"app_id": 212555972273585}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=0.1, maximum-scale=10.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf9dc\"", "article_summary": "The poor, she said, should rely on churches and charitable organizations for help.\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking at Obamacare right now,\u201d Ernst said.\nIt\u2019s exponentially harder to remove people once they\u2019ve already been on those programs.\u201d\u201cWe have lost a reliance on not only our own families, but so much of what our churches and private organizations used to do,\u201d she went on.\nThey used to provide clothing for those that really needed it, but we have gotten away from that.\n\u201cOnce we start with those benefits in January, how are we going to get people off of those?"}
