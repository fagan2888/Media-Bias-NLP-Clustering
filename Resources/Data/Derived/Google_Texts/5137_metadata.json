The bill will be considered by the House, which is also dominated by Republicans.\n\nThe legislation contains a narrow exception for medical emergencies, but not for rape or incest.\n\nIf imposed, the ban would affect a small number of pregnancies. According to Planned Parenthood, almost 99 percent of abortions in the U.S. occur before 21 weeks.\n\nIn an interview with The Daily Signal, bill sponsor Jay Hottinger, R-Newark, said that there is \u201cmounting evidence\u201d that the unborn feel pain by 20 weeks.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re learning more and more from science and medicine, we\u2019re seeing more and more evidence that the unborn feel pain at 20 weeks,\u201d Hottinger said.\n\nHottinger said that many people who identify themselves as pro-choice support restrictions on late-term abortions.\n\nHottinger added that the U.S. is one of only seven countries\u2014which also include North Korea and China\u2014that permit abortion beyond 20 weeks.\n\nState Sen. Charleta Tavares, D-Columbus, told the Cleveland Plain Dealer that the legislation would enact \u201cone of the most extreme abortion bans in the country.\u201d\n\n\u201cI trust women,\u201d Tavares said. \u201cI trust that we have the capabilities to make the decisions about what is best for us and our families.\u201d\n\nOhio Right to Life has identified the bill as their \u201cpremier legislation for 2015.\u201d\n\nStephanie Ranade Krider, the executive director of Ohio Right to Life, praised the \u201cmomentous\u201d vote in a statement.\n\n\u201cWith the Ohio Senate, we are leading Ohio down a historic path that is redefining the abortion debate in America,\u201d Krider said.\n\n\u201cOhio is poised to make a real difference in how we promote and protect the dignity of every human life in our state,\u201d she added.\n\nIf passed by the House, Gov. John Kasich, R-Ohio, is expected to sign the legislation into law.\n\nKasich is reportedly preparing to launch a presidential campaign.\n\nAccording to a recent Quinnipiac University poll, 60 percent of Americans and 59 percent of women support legislation banning abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy.\n\nIn May, the U.S. House of Representatives approved a federal Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act. Earlier this month, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., introduced the legislation in the U.S. Senate.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Ohio Senate has passed legislation that would prohibit late-term abortions in the state.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The Ohio Senate has passed legislation that would prohibit late-term abortions in the state.", "title": "Ohio Moves to Ban Late-Term Abortions", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150629_PainCapableOhio_Scanlon.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-06-29T16:33:09+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1g3kZOK"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The Ohio Senate has passed legislation that would prohibit late-term abortions in the state.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150629_PainCapableOhio_Scanlon.jpg"}, "title": "Ohio Moves to Ban Late-Term Abortions", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "Protecting Life", "published_time": "2015-06-29T15:59:23+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-29T16:33:09+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Abortion, prolife, pro-life, pain capable, pain capable act, Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, John Kasich, Ohio Right to Life"}, "article_summary": "The Ohio Senate has passed legislation that would prohibit late-term abortions in the state.\n\u201cWith the Ohio Senate, we are leading Ohio down a historic path that is redefining the abortion debate in America,\u201d Krider said.\nThe Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act would ban abortion after 20 weeks\u2014roughly halfway through a pregnancy.\nHottinger said that many people who identify themselves as pro-choice support restrictions on late-term abortions.\nAccording to a recent Quinnipiac University poll, 60 percent of Americans and 59 percent of women support legislation banning abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy."}
