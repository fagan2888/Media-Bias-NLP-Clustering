And a recent study by Johns Hopkins University found that providing transgender-related care is cost-effective in the long run because it generally reduces the likelihood of depression, anxiety and other conditions that take a toll on well-being and productivity. Moreover, the cost of this coverage for insurers would be negligible.\n\nPhoto\n\nYet transgender Americans continue to face significant barriers to affordable medical care because of exclusions in health insurance policies and a scarcity of specialized providers.\n\nWhen Our Lady J learned this fall that the Writers Guild of America health plan, which provides an insurance plan for writers in Hollywood, does not cover transition-related care, she was distraught. It reminded her of a darker time in her life, when she was suicidal and struggled with substance abuse, largely as a result of being unable to afford the medical care she needed.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFirst, she wondered if the exclusion was an oversight, but then she learned that someone had challenged it this year and was turned down. \u201cHaving to battle for insurance and having to battle with doctors is overwhelming,\u201d Our Lady J said. \u201cTaking care of your health as a trans person can feel like a full-time job.\u201d\n\nYour Stories Hear from a diverse group of transgender voices, and add your own.

Even as more people gain coverage, many struggle to find doctors, especially surgeons, because medical providers have had little incentive to specialize in a field that the insurance industry has historically shunned.\n\nFor decades, transition-related care was a fringe medical specialty. There was no consensus among doctors about the wisdom and safety of helping people transform their bodies. Over time, as more people transitioned, researchers recognized that people who got treatment were more likely to lead healthy, productive lives.\n\nThe American Medical Association, the largest group of doctors in the country, published a landmark resolution in 2008 that said barriers to transition-related care needed to be eliminated, citing \u201can established body of medical research that demonstrates the effectiveness and medical necessity\u201d of transition-related care. Every other prominent medical association in the country has echoed that assessment. But a corresponding shift in public policy has begun to take root only over the past couple of years.\n\nPast Transgender Today Editorials\n\nIn 2014, an Army veteran successfully appealed Medicare\u2019s policy of refusing to pay for sex reassignment surgery. Federal health officials who reviewed her complaint concluded that such exclusions were \u201cno longer reasonable,\u201d in light of the growing body of medical research. The ruling changed Medicare policy and was a turning point in the fight for transgender equality, because private insurance providers and state officials often adopt Medicare coverage standards.\n\nState officials in at least 12 states \u2014 including New York \u2014 and the District of Columbia have taken steps in recent years to bar insurance companies from excluding transgender care in policies.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services issued a proposed rule on the issue this summer, saying policies that categorically exclude gender transition care are discriminatory under the Affordable Care Act. Michael Silverman, the executive director of the Transgender Legal Defense and Education Fund, which advocates for transgender patients, said this could mark a transformational moment.\n\nSign up for email updates Tell me when the next installments of \u201cTransgender Today\u201d are available.\n\n\u201cBut we will still see a period of time when entrenched attitudes and misconceptions continue to prevail,\u201d he said. \u201cMany people still don\u2019t think of this as medically necessary care, so they reflexively deny claims because that\u2019s what they\u2019ve always done.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nEven in states that have prohibited insurance companies from denying transition care, discriminatory policies and practices are common. (The New York Times Company\u2019s health insurance plans retain an exclusion for gender reassignment surgery; because they are self-funded, they are not required to follow New York State policy.) The Writers Guild health fund in California, which is also self-funded, is not subject to the 2013 state policy that banned transgender care exclusions in insurance policies.\n\nWhile a growing number of employers have phased out exclusions voluntarily, it often takes an individual willing to challenge the policy. Our Lady J has asked executives at the Writers Guild plan, which is expected to vote on proposed changes to its health plan on Wednesday, to do away with the exclusion. The guild should heed her call.\n\nThe collective toll these exclusions take on the transgender community, and American society, is sobering. Researchers have found that transgender people who are unable to transition medically are more likely to suffer from depression, more prone to self-destructive behavior and less likely to be employed.\n\n\u201cWhen you are living in a body you don\u2019t identify with, it\u2019s easy not to take care of that body,\u201d Our Lady J said. \u201cI am healthier because of what I have done with my transition. I am a more productive person. I am a better citizen.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "opinion", "ptime": 20151209032103, "twitter": {"description": "Despite important policy changes, transgender people continue to face barriers to affordable, critical medical care.", "title": "No Reason to Exclude Transgender Medical Care", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/09/opinion/no-reason-to-exclude-transgender-medical-care.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000004080890"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/12/09/opinion/09wed2/09wed2-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/09/opinion/no-reason-to-exclude-transgender-medical-care.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000004080890", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/09/opinion/no-reason-to-exclude-transgender-medical-care.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion", "hdl_p": "Access to Transgender Medical Care", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Dec. 9, 2015", "edt": "NewYork", "ttl": "Transgender Today (Series)", "keywords": "Editorials,Series,Health Insurance and Managed Care,Doctors,Medicine and Health,Transgender and Transsexuals,Transgender Today (Series)", "news_keywords": "Editorial,Doctor", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "The Editorial Board", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/12/09/opinion/09wed2/09wed2-thumbLarge.jpg", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "byl": "By THE EDITORIAL BOARD", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "Despite important policy changes, transgender people continue to face barriers to affordable, critical medical care.", "tom": "Editorial", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/12/09/opinion/09wed2/09wed2-thumbStandard.jpg", "description": "Despite important policy changes, transgender people continue to face barriers to affordable, critical medical care.", "CG": "opinion", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Dec. 9, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "Editorial", "article": {"author": "http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/opinion/editorialboard.html", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/opinion/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "modified": "2015-12-09", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Transgender Today (Series)", "published": "2015-12-09", "section-taxonomy-id": "AD8090D7-4137-4D71-84C8-70DA3BD89778"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "slug": "09wed2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20151209214103, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/09/opinion/no-reason-to-exclude-transgender-medical-care.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/12/09/opinion/09wed2/09wed2-facebookJumbo-v3.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Despite important policy changes, transgender people continue to face barriers to affordable, critical medical care.", "title": "No Reason to Exclude Transgender Medical Care"}, "pdate": 20151209, "des": "Transgender and Transsexuals", "articleid": 100000004080890, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "No Reason to Exclude Transgender Medical Care", "col": "Editorial", "PST": "Editorial"}, "article_summary": "PhotoYet transgender Americans continue to face significant barriers to affordable medical care because of exclusions in health insurance policies and a scarcity of specialized providers.\nThe American Medical Association, the largest group of doctors in the country, published a landmark resolution in 2008 that said barriers to transition-related care needed to be eliminated, citing \u201can established body of medical research that demonstrates the effectiveness and medical necessity\u201d of transition-related care.\nFederal health officials say insurers and medical providers that discriminate against transgender individuals by denying transition-related care are violating the law.\nThe Department of Health and Human Services issued a proposed rule on the issue this summer, saying policies that categorically exclude gender transition care are discriminatory under the Affordable Care Act.\nIt reminded her of a darker time in her life, when she was suicidal and struggled with substance abuse, largely as a result of being unable to afford the medical care she needed."}
