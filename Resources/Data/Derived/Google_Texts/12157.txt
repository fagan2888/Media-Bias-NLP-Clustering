A college football ring that belongs to a former Aggie, somehow ended up at an estate shop in Florida. .

KOB is trying to help the NMSU Athletics Department get the ring back to its original and rightful owner.

A Daytona Beach woman who used to live in Las Cruces saw the New Mexico State University class ring at a shop in Florida.

Paula Somerville says she just had to buy it and get it back to New Mexico.

So Somerville paid $50 and contacted the athletics department for NMSU.

She has since shipped the ring back to Las Cruces and they're working to get it back to the owner Kevin Childress.

So a token from 1978 for Kevin Childress is ready and waiting for him in Las Cruces thanks to Paula Somerville in Florida
