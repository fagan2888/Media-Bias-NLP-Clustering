Mark Rykoff / Al Jazeera America\n\nNEW YORK \u2014 At Kings County Hospital in Brooklyn, it takes, on average, two hours to see an emergency room doctor, 13 more to be admitted to the hospital and nine after that to get a bed. Five percent of patients \u2014 five times the national average \u2014 simply leave without being seen at all. Nurses at public hospitals throughout New York City say they routinely care for 10 to 13 patients at a time. The New York State Nurses Association recommends that workloads for most nurses range from 1 to 4 patients. And when the city and state governments started slashing their budgets in 2009 as the economic crisis deepened, the city\u2019s public hospital system had to shutter clinics in the Bronx, Brooklyn and Queens to try to close a widening budget gap. This is the face of New York City\u2019s looming public health care crisis \u2014 and it\u2019s being mirrored across the country. Since the recession, public health systems have struggled to stay afloat as state governments cut their share of Medicaid spending and the Affordable Care Act scales down federal payments for treating uninsured patients, whose numbers the law presumed would plummet as a result of the Medicaid expansion. With the biggest of the ACA\u2019s cuts still to come, many public hospitals now face grave threats to their bottom line. \u201cPublic hospitals are often very reliant on Medicaid,\u201d says Beth Feldpush, senior vice president of policy and advocacy at America\u2019s Essential Hospitals, a national association of public hospitals. Continued cuts \u201ccould be a huge financial challenge,\u201d she says. According to annual surveys by the American Hospital Association, the country lost 16 public hospitals from 2003 to 2008. From 2009 to 2012, it lost 55 more, and another 27 in 2013 alone.\n\nResearch has shown that high patient loads for hospital nurses can be fatal.\n\nThe experience of the New York City Health and Hospitals Corp., or HHC, the country\u2019s largest public health system, illustrates the challenge of funding public health care. From 2008 to 2010, the state government's contributions to HHC declined by $240 million, or about 15 percent, as the state cut its share of Medicaid spending in a recession-driven austerity measure. Faced with rising costs and falling revenues, the corporation scrambled to reduce its budget deficit, which exceeded $650 million in 2009. In May 2010, HHC outlined a $300 million cost-cutting plan, dubbed \u201cThe Road Ahead,\u201d which drew most of its savings from eliminating a tenth of the corporation\u2019s workforce over five years. Nurses working in the HHC system, which served 1.4 million patients in 2014, say their patient loads have grown significantly during the hiring freeze that began with The Road Ahead. Kristen, a contract nurse who has worked in several HHC hospitals and asked that her last name be withheld out of concern for losing her job, says that even when HHC does hire nurses, it\u2019s only for 13-week contracts. \u201cThey\u2019re not hiring staff; they\u2019re hiring travel positions,\u201d she says. Research has shown that high patient loads for hospital nurses can be fatal. A landmark 2002 study found that every patient added to an average nurse\u2019s workload increased mortality odds by 7 percent, and hospitals with nurse-to-patient ratios of 1-to-8 see five more deaths per 1,000 patients than hospitals with 1-to-4 ratios. The study, which looked at 168 hospitals in California, notes that the researchers were unable to estimate mortality rates for hospitals with 1-to-10 ratios or higher because \u201cthere were so few hospitals in our sample staffed at that level.\u201d In 2004, California adopted a safe-staffing law mandating nurse-to-patient ratios of no more than 1-to-6. Similar bills have been introduced in New York but have never passed.\n\nWoodhull Hospital, in Brooklyn, where understaffing has led to overcrowding. Mark Rykoff / Al Jazeera America Understaffing also leads to overcrowding, and when hospitals get too busy, patients slip through the cracks. On Aug. 23, 2011, a 33-year-old woman gave birth at Woodhull Medical Center in Brooklyn via cesarean section. After her surgery, she developed eclampsia in the labor and delivery unit and started to have seizures. No one noticed when she became unresponsive. It was eventually discovered that she had had a cerebral hemorrhage, and she died after being transferred to Bellevue Hospital in Manhattan for emergency surgery. Woodhull immediately suspended one of the patient\u2019s doctors, Usukumah Usukumah; he later sued to have his license reinstated. In court records, Usukumah\u2019s and Woodhull\u2019s lawyers disagree about almost every detail of the woman\u2019s case, except one: Aug. 23, 2011, the day she arrived at the hospital, was a \u201cvery, very busy day\u201d in the labor and delivery unit, according to court testimony from Woodhull OB/GYN Kwakuvi Manigar. Four doctors testified that the unit was too busy to provide quality care to patients. When asked why the patient didn\u2019t receive treatment for pre-eclampsia before her seizures started, Dr. Paul Kastell, the primary complainant against Usukumah, said, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t for lack of good medicine. It was just that everyone was busy doing other things.\u201d\n\n'There\u2019s extreme discrimination in the way that New York state treats public hospitals.' Judy Wessler former director, Commission on the Public's Health\n\nAs the rollout of the ACA began, many state governments, which typically cover 25 to 50 percent of Medicaid costs, looked to cut more from the program to pay for the law. Feldpush says that the extent of the cuts was often \u201carbitrary.\u201d \u201cStates would say, \u2018Oh no, we need $4 billion to pay for the ACA. Let\u2019s take it out of Medicaid.\u2019 \u201d In some ways, New York state\u2019s government has been especially unfriendly to public hospitals. Under a Department of Health and Human Services formula, the state's 21 major public hospitals are permitted to receive no more than one-sixth of funding allocated to hospitals that treat uninsured patients. Yet they provide more than a third of the state's uncompensated care. A state-run program intended to help fund safety net hospitals, which treat many low-income and uninsured patients, defines \u201csafety net\u201d so broadly that 42 of 47 hospitals in New York City meet the requirements for aid. That grants many well-off nonprofit and academic hospitals access to the program\u2019s limited money. The list of qualified facilities includes Mount Sinai Hospital, which has assets of $2.6 billion and sees on average only half as many Medicaid recipients and uninsured patients as HHC hospitals. \u201cThere\u2019s extreme discrimination in the way that New York state treats public hospitals,\u201d says Judy Wessler, former director of the health care advocacy organization Commission on the Public\u2019s Health System. That may be in part because public hospitals don't have the lobbying capacity of their nonprofit and for-profit peers. The Healthcare Education Project, a partnership between 1199SEIU United Healthcare Workers East and the Greater New York Hospital Association, spent more than $36 million on lobbying from 2005 to 2010, the most of any union lobbyist in that period. GNYHA includes public hospitals among its members, but the overwhelming majority of the hospitals in its network are nonprofit. Similarly, 1199SEIU, the country\u2019s largest health care union, represents few HHC employees. (Most employees of the public system are represented by the municipal workers\u2019 union DC37.) In 2011, the Healthcare Education Project spent more than all but one lobbying entity in the state, contributing $6.8 million. That year, recently elected Gov. Andrew Cuomo established a task force to cut the cost of what his office referred to at the time as \u201cNew York\u2019s bloated Medicaid program.\u201d Former 1199 president Dennis Rivera co-chaired the handpicked team. Under him were GNYHA president Kenneth Raske and current 1199 president George Gresham. No HHC representative was appointed. To bring down Medicaid costs, the task force proposed a 2 percent across-the-board cut in Medicaid reimbursements for the 2011-2012 state budget \u2014 especially damaging to public hospitals because of their heavy reliance on such payments. The bulk of the Healthcare Education Project\u2019s 2011 expenditures went to an advertising campaign supporting the cuts. \u201cIt\u2019s a very political situation,\u201d says Wessler. \u201cWhere the bread is buttered, I think, is the best way of saying it.\u201d With state aid continuing to decline, HHC has had to keep cutting expenditures, even beyond what was planned under The Road Ahead. Every year since 2009, HHC has spent tens or hundreds of millions of dollars less than anticipated as the corporation further reduces payroll. In 2014, the most recent year for which HHC\u2019s public budget projections make comparison possible, the corporation spent $350 million less on salaries than projected before The Road Ahead.\n\n[T]he corporation plans to cut the equivalent of 1,000 additional full-time staff in the next 18 months to save another $100 million a year.\n\nA May 2015 review of HHC\u2019s finances by the City Council executive budget committee says the corporation plans to cut the equivalent of 1,000 additional full-time staff in the next 18 months to save another $100 million a year. In June, HHC needed a last-minute payment of $318 million from the federal government when the corporation\u2019s cash-on-hand dipped to less than eight days worth of funding. The corporation projects a $1.4 billion deficit in 2018, about one-fifth of HHC\u2019s total budget. The HHC press office did not respond to questions about past and upcoming budget cuts. It redirected Al Jazeera America to HHC President Ramanathan Raju\u2019s public testimonies on the corporation\u2019s website, including his testimony at the May 2015 City Council meeting to discuss the executive budget committee\u2019s review. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to really find enough revenue to offset all the cuts which are coming our way,\u201d said Raju at the meeting, \u201cbecause we do not want to do the other things of reducing employees [and] reducing services.\u201d Four days after the release of the Council\u2019s review, New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer issued a report detailing the biggest threat yet to HHC\u2019s bottom line: the loss of $827 million from 2017 to 2019 as the ACA phases out supplemental Medicaid payments to facilities that serve high numbers of uninsured patients, known as Disproportionate Share Hospital payments, or DSH. The ACA was built on the assumption that these DSH payments would become less important as more people took advantage of the law\u2019s Medicaid expansion to get insurance. \u201cIt\u2019s not a bad theory,\u201d says Feldpush of America\u2019s Essential Hospitals, \u201cbut there\u2019s a big difference between theory and practice.\u201d HHC\u2019s uninsured patient population of half a million people decreased only 1.3 percent from 2013 to 2014 because undocumented immigrants aren\u2019t eligible for Medicaid under the ACA. Right now, 11 percent of HHC\u2019s revenue comes from federal DSH payments, and if the phaseout of that funding begins as scheduled in 2017, it will greatly exacerbate the corporation\u2019s budget crisis.\n\n'You have to provide services \u2026 to anyone who walks through the door, whether or not they can pay.
