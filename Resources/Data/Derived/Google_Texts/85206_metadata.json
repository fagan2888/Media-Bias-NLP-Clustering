In a new report, the American Cancer Society predicts that nearly 126,000 new cancers will be diagnosed among Hispanics this year and an estimated 38,000 will die from the disease.\n\nAlthough overall cancer rates are 20 percent lower among Hispanics compared with whites and cancer death rates are 30 percent lower, cancer is still the biggest killer among Hispanics, said cancer society epidemiologist Kim Miller, one of the authors of the report.\n\n\u201cThe good news is that the rates for the four most common cancers \u2014 prostate, breast, lung and colon \u2014 are lower in Hispanics than in whites,\u201d she said.\n\nIn addition, cancer rates among Hispanics are dropping 2.4 percent per year in men and 0.5 percent per year in women, which mirrors trends among whites, Miller said.\n\nThe report was published Sept. 16 in CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians.\n\nAccording to the report, lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among Hispanic men. This year, liver cancer will surpass colon cancer as the second leading cause of cancer deaths among Hispanic men.\n\nLiver cancer deaths among Hispanic men and women are about double those among white men and women, the researchers found.\n\nAmong Hispanic women, breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer death at 16 percent of all cancer deaths, followed by lung and colon cancers, the findings showed.\n\nMiller said that lung cancer is now the leading cause of cancer death among U.S. women overall. However, since Hispanic women have traditionally smoked less, lung cancer deaths are 70 percent lower among Hispanic women than among white women. In 2014, 8 percent of Hispanic women smoked cigarettes, compared with 17 percent of white women, she said.\n\nSince 1995, cancer death rates among Hispanic men have been on the decline and have been declining among women since 1996 \u2014 four years later than among whites, the researchers reported.\n\nMiller said that Hispanics have a higher risk of cancers tied to infections \u2014 such as those of the stomach, liver and cervix \u2014 than whites. Stomach and liver cancer rates and deaths among Hispanics are double those of whites, she said.\n\nMiller suggested that Hispanics are vulnerable to inequalities in cancer diagnosis and care. They are less likely than whites to be diagnosed with cancer at an early stage, especially for melanoma skin cancer and breast cancer, she explained.\n\nSome of the disparity results from less access to care, she said.\n\nLess access to high-quality care because of poverty and lack of insurance also worries Jane Delgado, president and CEO of the National Alliance for Hispanic Health.\n\n\u201cThis cancer pattern is what has concerned us for a while, and it is another reason why we have been very active in encouraging people to enroll in health insurance,\u201d she said.\n\nDelgado said that the problem is particularly acute in Florida and Texas \u2014 two states with large Hispanic populations that have not opted for expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. This has left many poor Hispanics without access to health care, she said.\n\nHighlighting a problem isn\u2019t enough, Delgado added. More needs to be done to bring health care to the Hispanic community, she said.\n\nHowever, Delgado explained, the data need to be looked at as part of the larger picture of the health of Hispanics: Hispanics live longer than whites and have less heart disease, regardless of having the factors that increase risk in other communities, such as obesity and diabetes.\n\nMiller suggested that, like all Americans, Hispanics need to make lifestyle changes \u2014 including a healthy diet and not smoking \u2014 to reduce their risk for cancer.\n\nMore information\n\nFor more on Hispanics and cancer, visit the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center.", "article_metadata": {"Content-Source": "healthcom", "description": "Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States overall, but a new report finds that cancer remains the number one killer of U.S. Hispanics.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "Health News / Tips & Trends / Celebrity Health", "description": "Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States overall, but a new report finds that cancer remains the number one killer of U.S. Hispanics.", "title": "This Is The Number One Cause of Death Among Hispanics", "url": "http://news.health.com/2015/09/16/cancer-still-the-leading-cause-of-death-for-u-s-hispanics-report/", "image": {"width": 620, "identifier": "https://healthnewsandviews.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/hispanic-cancer1.jpg", "height": 340}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://healthnewsandviews.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/hispanic-cancer1.jpg?w=640"}, "site": "@goodhealth", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "search_title": "This Is The Number One Cause of Death Among Hispanics", "msapplication-tooltip": "Health's blog features breaking news, celebrity tips, exercise videos, and more!
