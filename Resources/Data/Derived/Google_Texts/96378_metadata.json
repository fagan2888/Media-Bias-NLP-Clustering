We know it is her plan to pull it away at the last second. But every time, year after year, we know that Charlie Brown will fall for the same old trick. He will resist at first, reminding her that he doesn\u2019t trust her, that he knows she will pull it away. But she eventually gets him to trust her, with the same inevitable results. We shake our heads and say, \u201cCharlie Brown, you\u2019re so gullible.\u201d\n\nIf we allow Congress to approve the impending Trans-Pacific Partnership, we will have proven ourselves just as gullible as Charlie Brown. However, the consequences will be far more serious than Charlie Brown\u2019s downfall. For decades here at The New American, we have been exposing the repeated bait-and-switch tactics and lies and deception used by the promoters of so-called free trade agreements.\n\nIn this regard and others, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP, is following in the footsteps of NAFTA (the North American Free Trade Agreement), CAFTA (the Central America Free Trade Agreement), the WTO (World Trade Organization) agreement, and many others.\n\nLucy\u2019s role has been played by both Republicans and Democrats in the White House and in Congress. Right now, President Obama is playing the top Lucy role, assisted by Secretary of State John Kerry. Not only is Kerry a supporter of the TPP, but he was also a supporter of NAFTA when he was in the Senate in the early 1990s.\n\nSenator Kerry ignored our warnings that NAFTA\u2019s Chapter 11 would establish supranational courts that would be used to undermine our sovereignty and override our Constitution, as well as our local, state, and federal laws. In 2002, almost a decade after NAFTA was passed, a Canadian real estate company appealed a U.S. court decision to a NAFTA tribunal. Senator Kerry feigned amazement. Kerry said at the time: \u201cWhen we debated NAFTA, not a single word was uttered in discussing Chapter 11. Why? Because we didn't know how this provision would play out. No one really knew just how high the stakes would get.\u201d\n\nFormer Congressman Abner Mikva is another NAFTA supporter who claimed to have been surprised by the sovereignty-invading tribunals spawned by the agreement. Mikva stated, \u201cIf Congress had known that there was anything like this in NAFTA, they would never have voted for it.\u201d\n\nIt is just like Kerry and Mikva to claim ignorance to excuse their shortcomings, but let\u2019s not allow any more politicians to \u201cCharlie Brown\u201d us again.\n\nIt is the responsibility of every senator and congressman to know what is in the legislation they pass and the treaties and agreements they approve. They are supposed to read the bills before voting on them.\n\nIt is time to hold our politicians accountable.\n\nContact your representatives now to stop the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and see the additional articles listed below that we\u2019ve published detailing the dangers of the TPP.\n\nRelated articles:\n\nTrans-Pacific Partnership (TPP): Bigger and More Dangerous Than ObamaCare (Video)\n\nDangers of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) Secret \"Trade\" Agreement (Video)\n\nTrans-Pacific Partnership (TPP): Assault on Our Sovereignty, Our Constitution, Our Liberty (Video)\n\nWikiLeaks Publishes Key Chapter of Secret TPP Agreement\n\nRegional Scheme for the Pacific Rim\n\nTrans-Pacific Partnership Ready for Christmas Delivery?\n\nTPP Secret Trade Agreement Puts International Tribunal Above U.S.\n\nThe \u201cFree Trade\u201d Agenda Threatens Our Rights\n\nTrans-Pacific Partnership: Secret Surrender of Sovereignty", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "TPP, Trans-Pacific Partnership, NAFTA, CAFTA, WTO, free trade agreements", "og": {"url": "http://www.thenewamerican.com/usnews/foreign-policy/item/17231-tpp-repeats-lies-deception-denials-of-nafta-cafta-wto-video", "type": "article", "description": "The Trans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP, is following in the footsteps of NAFTA and other so-called free trade agreements.
