MANY Micronesians have moved abroad to be closer with other family members, seek job opportunities, stay away from hometown politics, obtain better healthcare services or higher education. Few may have struggled but many have survived and are doing well.

Jojo Peter, PhD and Josie Howard are from Chuuk who came to Hawaii to study at the University of Hawaii. Howard has a master’s degree in social work and is now with a nonprofit that helps at-risk families. Peter and Howard are leaders of COFA CAN — which stands for the Compact of Free Association Community Advocacy Network — and We Are Oceania.

These groups, along with the Micronesian Community Network, have been working to help address healthcare issues of Micronesians, including helping them navigate the complex enrollment process for Obamacare.

They also helped push the Hawaii Legislature to help COFA citizens with Affordable Care Act co-pays.

On the Big Island, another nonprofit, Micronesians United, has been working on behalf of COFA immigrant.

In Honolulu, Halau Ola One-Stop Center opened in August to act as a “central hub” linking Micronesians with public services and other resources.

The late great Mau Piaulug of Yap taught Hawaiians traditional navigation skills. He also taught us to see ourselves as one humanity while recognizing our differences.

Micronesians abroad continue to share their rich culture with the rest of the world.

In Hawaii, there’s Katsue Ngirchokebai and Klen Kloulubak Towai. In Texas, Palau Rafael.

And in Minnesota, Michael Elias documents Chuukese family stories: their social gatherings — fishing, planting vegetables, singing and dancing, cooking and more.

Their stories encourage all Micronesians to share and help one another wherever they are.
