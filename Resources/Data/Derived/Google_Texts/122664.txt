INDIANAPOLIS (WISH) — Officials confirmed that Indiana University Health will close its University Hospital to consolidate and expand their facilities at their Methodist and Riley campuses.

According to IU Health, a million dollar project will expand the campus at Methodist. The project is expected to take five to seven years.

The campus will have classroom space and faculty officers for the Indiana University School of Medicine.

IU Health officials say the project was recommended by IU Health’s management after a review process. The measure was approved at Thursday nights IU Health board meeting.

Directors said they made a decision on the location of the new adult academic health center. The new location of the consolidated adult services hospital will be located at Capitol Avenue and 16th Street. The location will also provide women’s services at or near Riley. Directors say they will provide specialized car for mothers and their newborns.
