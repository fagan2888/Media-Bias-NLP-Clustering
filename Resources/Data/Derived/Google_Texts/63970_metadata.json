The positive health and economic benefits will be felt across the state. We are excited to begin the next phase of providing Maricopa County residents with world-class facilities for their public county hospital.\"\n\nPlanning for the bond measure began over a year ago, when a 15-member citizens' Bond Advisory Committee conducted a series of 18 meetings, including five public town halls, to assess the condition and needs of MIHS. The Maricopa Medical Center, the most visible part of the system, is more than 40 years old and considered functionally obsolete.\n\nThe MIHS Board of Directors, after conducting an independent review of the Bond Advisory's recommendation to put a bond measure of up to $935 million on the Nov. 4 ballot, agreed in May to seek the election. The measure generated opposition from anti-tax activists, but won endorsements from key elected officials, ranging from U.S. Rep. Ed Pastor, a Democrat, to Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio.\n\nThe Arizona Republic, the state's largest newspaper, also endorsed the proposition, saying that despite the Affordable Care Act, \"We still need a safety net health care provider.\n\n\"The hospital in which those (MIHS) doctors work is an embarrassment, a Nixon-era structure whose obsolescence is a daily obstacle to quality care. If the Maricopa Integrated Health System is to continue playing its role serving an otherwise neglected population, it will need new facilities,\" the newspaper's editorial page said.\n\nThe election victory will kick start a public planning process to help make critical upgrades to the health care system, which is licensed for 515 beds (325 acute and 190 psychiatric). MIHS includes two behavioral health centers, 11 neighborhood Family Health Centers located across Maricopa County, the McDowell Healthcare Center, the county's first HIV/AIDS clinic and the Arizona Children's Center.\n\nAbout Maricopa Integrated Health System\n\nMaricopa Integrated Health System, located in Maricopa County, Arizona, is the state's only public health care system.
