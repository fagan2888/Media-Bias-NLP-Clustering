Consequently, they obtain legitimate cards and PINs,\u201d according to the release.\n\nIn an interview with Personal Finance this week, Pillay said the perpetrators had stolen the identities of customers and provided the required documentation, which the banks had \u201cverified\u201d \u2013 and that there had been compliance with the Know-Your-Customer provisions in the Financial Intelligence Centre Act (better known as Fica).\n\nHow then did the fraud occur?\n\nPillay told me that, during a television interview on Wednesday morning, she was asked if the banks are being reckless. \u201cI had to put it in context,\u201d she said. \u201cIf banks had to physically verify their customers, you would have to wait months for an investigator to check [the information provided].\u201d\n\nWhy would the banks make available to the public an online credit application system that is inherently risky? To make it easy for you, the legitimate customer, to access credit. The banks also want to take the pain out of banking, and to keep you out of their branches.\n\nSo what if card fraud is on the increase? If the banks are taking the knock, why should you care? Because someone, eventually, has got to cover the cost of these losses, and the banks are not known for their benevolence \u2013 or fairness, for that matter.\n\nClive Pillay, the Ombudsman for Banking Services, is collating statistics that he will present to the Financial Services Board early next year. The report will analyse cases finalised by his office to determine where banks have made gratuitous payments to customers (meaning payments without accepting liability), and where payments have been made with an acceptance of liability. The ombudsman says that it is relatively rare for a bank to admit liability.\n\nThis is unfair, and will not fly when the Treating Customers Fairly initiative, which will underpin the new regulatory regime, is in force (apparently by the end of next year).\n\n\u201cIt means that one can never isolate the problem \u2013 whether it is bank-specific or systemic \u2013 or remedy it,\u201d Pillay says.\n\nAccording to the Sabric release, there has also been an increase in lost or stolen card fraud (a 521-percent increase), card-not-present fraud (21 percent) and debit card fraud (five percent). Percentage increases can make a problem look worse than it is when coming off a low base.\n\nThe debit card losses relate mostly to counterfeit card fraud, according to the release. For a fraudster to create a counterfeit card, he first has to skim your card.\n\nCard skimming involves the illegal copying of encoded information from the magnetic strip of a legitimate card by means of a card reader. Fraudsters use a handheld skimming device at the point of sale or fit a device into an ATM card reader. Devices inserted into ATM card readers are not visible, at least to users with an untrained eye.\n\nSabric\u2019s Pillay admits that there\u2019s not a lot we can do to protect ourselves from this type of fraud or from false application fraud. The banks will introduce measures to make it harder for criminals to get credit in your name, she says.\n\nBut Peter Hill, an expert in IT governance and privacy, says Sabric\u2019s statistics show that fraudsters have easy access to our personal information. \u201cPoor control over personal information by financial institutions and cell phone companies makes the loss of personal details inevitable,\u201d Hill says.\n\nThe president signed the Protection of Personal Information (Popi) Act more than a year ago, but it has yet to be fully enacted. Consequently, consumers continue to be exposed to high levels of risk in their daily transactions, as many enterprises don\u2019t have adequate procedures in place to securely process the personal information that they so often collect, Hill says.\n\nThe sections of the Act that are effective empower the Minister of Justice and Constitutional Development to issue regulations and establish the Information Regulator, the first two basic steps towards implementing Popi, Hill says.\n\n\u201cPopi will require banks to implement generally acceptable standards of information security and to be transparent about this. Every fraud will be reportable to the Information Regulator and those affected. Right now we don\u2019t know whether banks are meeting acceptable standards for information security. We don\u2019t know exactly how prevalent the security weaknesses are. We know from the Paygate incident that the banks were not compliant with PCI-DSS (a security standard for the payment card industry), even though they force this standard on all retailers and don\u2019t tell everyone who is affected about breaches when they occur.\u201d\n\nUntil Popi is fully enacted and giving you the protection you need, there is something that you can do. If you regularly check your credit report, you will be able to pick up whether credit has been acquired in your name. Credit bureaus give you one free report a year.\n\nThere are four major consumer bureaus: Compuscan, Experian, TransUnion and XDS. By exercising your right to a free report a year from each of the bureaus, you are able to check your report once a quarter, at no cost.\n\nWHAT IS PERSONAL INFORMATION?\n\nYour identity document (ID), passport, driver\u2019s licence, salary advice, bank account statements, municipal bills and store account statements are all personal and should to kept under lock and key, the South African Banking Risk Information Centre advises. You should also avoid: carrying personal information in your wallet or purse; disclosing personal information, such as passwords and PINs, via fax or email; and the use of obvious passwords, such as birth dates and first names. Furthermore, when destroying personal information, shred or burn it rather than tearing it up and throwing it in the bin or sending it for recycling.\n\nIf your ID or driver\u2019s licence is lost or stolen, report it to the police immediately and alert the South African Fraud Prevention Service (SAFPS) on 0860 101 248 or at www.safps.org.za. The SAFPS will put your details on a database used by banks and retailers to try to prevent fraudsters from acquiring credit in your name.\n\nFollow us on Twitter\n\nHave your say on our Facebook page", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "browserconfig.xml", "description": "undefined", "og": {"url": "http://www.iol.co.za/business/personal-finance/banking/banks-must-up-their-game-or-cough-up-1788287", "image": "http://classic.iol.co.za/polopoly_fs/pf-iol-29nov-cardfraud-iol-1.1788286!/image/270967565.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_600/270967565.jpg", "site_name": "IOL", "description": "undefined", "title": "Banks must up their game, or cough up | IOL"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "IOL", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "google-site-verification": "YmiNpvzQrHdqXOi__ytAIEQM_vjpAQvum7AZW5rs1xE", "viewport": "width=device-width,height=device-height, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7437\"", "article_summary": "\u201cSabric has found that criminals misuse the online application channels provided by banks by using false details to open multiple credit card accounts.\nYou should also avoid: carrying personal information in your wallet or purse; disclosing personal information, such as passwords and PINs, via fax or email; and the use of obvious passwords, such as birth dates and first names.\nAccording to the Sabric release, there has also been an increase in lost or stolen card fraud (a 521-percent increase), card-not-present fraud (21 percent) and debit card fraud (five percent).\n\u201cPoor control over personal information by financial institutions and cell phone companies makes the loss of personal details inevitable,\u201d Hill says.\nIf you regularly check your credit report, you will be able to pick up whether credit has been acquired in your name."}
