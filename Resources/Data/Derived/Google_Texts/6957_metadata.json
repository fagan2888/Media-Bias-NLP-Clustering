Because of similar problems, the federal government and other states that had contracts with CGI Corp. cut ties with the vendor.\n\nHawaii Medical Service Association, the state's largest health insurer, recently announced it won't participate in the Connector's Small Business Health Options Program as of January.\n\nThe Connector, already under fire for being the most costly exchange in the nation, is left with just one insurance company for local small business owners to select - Kaiser Permanente.\n\nThe decision by HMSA came after it spent 8,000 hours dealing with the exchange's technical problems, which drained finances and staffing resources, and information on 133 patient accounts vanished as they were transferred from the connector to HMSA.\n\nHMSA will continue to insure another 5,000 people enrolled through the individual subscriber portion of the Connector.\n\nClick for more from Watchdog.org.", "article_metadata": {"prism.subsection1": "state-local",
