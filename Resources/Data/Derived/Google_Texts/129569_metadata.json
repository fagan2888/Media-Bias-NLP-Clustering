White\u2019s patients trusted him, but his patients say in the end, they were only left with pain. More former patients of Dr. White are coming forward with emotional pleas for help.\n\nWhite is being sued by Debby Schallock, a former patient who accuses White of installing screws and rods in her back that were allegedly made in a tool shop.\n\nDebby Schallock connects with others through a Facebook group containing almost 500 individuals who claim to have undergone surgery performed by White.\n\nMany of the surgeries allegedly occurred at Aurora St. Luke\u2019s Medical Center in Milwaukee. Schallock said she first saw White for neck pain. She believes the materials used in that surgery are counterfeit.\n\nAccording to a lawsuit filed by another former patient against White and the hospital, White is accused of taking kickbacks from a medical supply distributor that mixed FDA-approved parts with counterfeit materials made in a tool shop.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a little scary, thinking that\u2019s inside of you,\u201d said Schallock.\n\nWhite voluntarily surrendered his medical license in 2013.\n\nAccording to White\u2019s records from disciplinary proceedings through the State of Wisconsin Medical Examining Board, White performed surgery on the wrong side of a patient\u2019s spine, and did not tell the patient.\n\nWhite also allegedly told the board, he performed 600 spine surgeries a year, twice as many as other physicians.\n\nWhite\u2019s assessment reads, \u201cDemonstrated good knowledge of surgical technique and approaches, but both chart reviews and discussions raised concerns about his foundational knowledge of the clinical diagnosis of neurosurgical spine conditions.\u201d\n\nWhite was also federally indicted for health care fraud.\n\n\u201cSeeing a dollar sign instead of a person, maybe.
