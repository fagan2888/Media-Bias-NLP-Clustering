Applying the same diagnostic skills used in the management of neurological diseases, Dr. Trobiani recognized that, before structural healthcare reform can be successfully undertaken, the cause of the system\u2019s malfunction must first be identified and isolated.\n\nDr. Trobiani\u2019s research has identified the management of healthcare delivery as the cause of our healthcare system\u2019s failure. \u201cManaged-care\u201d, as this is commonly known, \u201cis simply too labor intensive to ever be cost-effective\u201d, reports Dr. Trobiani. \u201cAfter 35 years of managed-care, we have acquired over 30 administrators for every doctor. This cost is now the principal driver of healthcare inflation and represents 56.5% of our healthcare spending. The cost of managed-care is why our private healthcare system has become unaffordable and why government-run programs relying on the same healthcare delivery management tools will also fail to make healthcare affordable. Instead of managing the delivery of healthcare, we need to manage the finance of healthcare. Rather than forcing the need to fit within the available funds, we need to create and grow the funds to more than exceed the need. This is the only path to affordable healthcare\u201d.\n\n\u201cSustainable Healthcare Reform: Harnessing the Power of Capitalism to Fund Our Social Needs\u201d exposes Obamacare more as a mechanism for taxing the middle class than as a means of healthcare reform. However, it is more than just another book decrying the problems with Obamacare. This book offers a way forward. It is the first and only book to offer a true, viable, private-market solution to our healthcare dilemma. It does so by completely re-inventing our approach to healthcare. It does so by eliminating the management of healthcare delivery and replacing it with the management of healthcare funding.\n\nDr. Trobiani has created and patented a system to manage the finance of healthcare that will:\n\n\n\nStabilize healthcare costs.\n\nPreserve and strengthen employer-sponsored healthcare.\n\nLimit employee healthcare expenses to the annual HSA contribution.\n\nEliminate all future employer healthcare costs after an initial vesting period.\n\nIncrease the net worth of companies using this plan.\n\nImprove the quality and affordability of healthcare.\n\nImprove compensation for healthcare professionals.\n\nProvide funding for retired personnel and thereby diminish the demands on Medicare.\n\nTo learn more about this innovative approach to healthcare reform go to https://www.politicsandhealthcare.com and order a soft-cover copy of the book \u201cSustainable Healthcare Reform\u201d, also available as an e-book through Amazon.com.\n\nSteven Trobiani, M.D. is the author of \u201cSustainable Healthcare Reform: Harnessing the Power of Capitalism to Fund Our Social Needs\u201d and the founder of Politics and Healthcare, Inc., https://www.politicsandhealthcare.com.
