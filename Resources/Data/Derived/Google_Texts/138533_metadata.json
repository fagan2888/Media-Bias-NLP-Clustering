But nearly 60 years ago, state lawmakers passed an exception \u2014 now the only one of its kind in the United States \u2014 for fireworks purchases by farms and fish hatcheries.\n\nThat\u2019s how vendors, including those in the ubiquitous tents that spring up along Florida roadsides, have gotten around the general fireworks prohibition for years.\n\nThey simply ask customers to sign forms saying they\u2019re buying under an agricultural or other exemption. There\u2019s also one for illuminating a stretch of railroad.\n\nThe Division of State Fire Marshal prepares a guide for fireworks inspections, and enforcement is left to spot-checking by local police and fire agencies.\n\nThe state\u2019s courts, however, have said that sellers aren\u2019t required to make sure a fireworks customer really needs to light up a railway or chase off geese.\n\nEven the head of the country\u2019s leading fireworks trade group is bemused by Florida\u2019s approach.\n\n\u201cThere are superstores selling fireworks just to get rid of pests?\u201d said Julie L. Heckman, executive director of the American Pyrotechnics Association. She said no other state has an agriculture exception.\n\n\u201cWith the expansion of consumer fireworks sales in Florida, there should not be a critter left alive there,\u201d Heckman said.\n\nA handful of counties, including Pinellas, have local ordinances more restrictive than state law, such as explicitly banning the sale of projectile fireworks.\n\nMeanwhile, the Legislature hasn\u2019t been moved to change the statewide status quo.\n\nIn fact, the only legislation introduced this year essentially would have legalized consumer fireworks. Both House and Senate bills died in committee.\n\nThat\u2019s because the industry is \u201cvery happy with where things are at,\u201d said state Sen. Jeff Brandes, R-St. Petersburg, who sponsored one of this year\u2019s bills.\n\nBy making people sign the exemption forms, \u201cwe force Floridians to commit fraud to buy anything other than a sparkler,\u201d Brandes said.\n\nThe year before, other bills would have gone the opposite direction, either repealing the agricultural exemption or requiring a buyer to actually show an agricultural license.\n\nThose measures also died in committee.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like the tip of an iceberg,\u201d said state Rep. Mark Danish, D-Tampa, who sponsored the repeal bill in 2013.\n\n\u201cIf you try to change even one thing, you open the whole can of worms of whether fireworks should be legal or illegal in Florida,\u201d Danish said. \u201cAnd no one wants to open that can.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not as though fireworks companies have been throwing around a lot of campaign money to maintain the status quo.\n\nIn the past 10 years, they\u2019ve contributed only about $60,000 in Florida House and Senate races, according to the National Institute on Money in State Politics.\n\nState records show three companies have registered lobbyists in Tallahassee: Southern Comfort Fireworks of Alabama, Shelton Fireworks of Missouri and Galaxy Fireworks, which is headquartered in Tampa.\n\nSharon Hunnewell-Johnson, Galaxy\u2019s president, takes pride in her products\u2019 safety, which she says exceed federal requirements.\n\nShe says consumers also have a responsibility to follow directions and use fireworks correctly.\n\nAs to Florida\u2019s fireworks laws, Hunnewell-Johnson said, \u201cAs an industry, we\u2019d like it to be a lot cleaner, but we don\u2019t want to be put out of business.\n\n\u201cI have a joke that we should take the \u2018fire\u2019 out of our name and call it \u2018funworks\u2019 instead,\u201d she said.\n\nNonetheless, last year there were eight deaths and about 11,400 injuries nationally from fireworks, the Consumer Product Safety Commission reported Thursday.\n\nThat\u2019s up from 8,700 injuries in 2012. And of last year\u2019s injuries, 65 percent happened in the 30 days surrounding the Fourth of July, the commission said.\n\nMost incidents resulted from improper handling or modification of fireworks or both, the report shows.\n\nIn one case, a 54-year-old man died after he set off an altered mortar shell by holding the launching tube near his chest.\n\nIn Florida, fire departments responded to 120 fireworks-related incidents, resulting in $302,000 in property damage and two injuries, according to the Department of Financial Services, which includes the Division of State Fire Marshal.\n\nIf that number seems low, it\u2019s because it doesn\u2019t include those who declined medical attention on the scene, drove themselves to a hospital or decided to seek treatment later, Division of State Fire Marshal spokeswoman Ashley Carr said.\n\nInjuries also may be underreported because people could have been afraid of getting in trouble and wouldn\u2019t say they were hurt by fireworks, she said.\n\nForty-six states allow at least some consumer fireworks, often through exemptions or other loopholes.\n\nFour states \u2014 Delaware, Massachusetts, New Jersey and New York \u2014 ban all consumer fireworks.\n\nHunnewell-Johnson said it\u2019s too early to get a handle on this year\u2019s sales, but she noted that July 4th falls on a Friday.\n\n\u201cI think the industry is planning for a good year,\u201d she said.\n\njrosica@tampatrib.com\n\n(850) 765-0807\n\nTwitter: @jlrosicaTBO", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sun, 29 Jun 2014 01:00:00 -0400", "Description": "The coming of Independence Day means fireworks season \u2014 and the beginning of the institutionalized charade behind their sale in Florida.", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "The coming of Independence Day means fireworks season \u2014 and the beginning of the institutionalized charade behind their sale in Florida.", "title": "Patriotism as pest control: Florida\u2019s weird fireworks law", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/news/politics/patriotism-as-pest-control-floridas-weird-fireworks-law-20140629/", "image": {"width": 3921, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20140629/ARTICLE/140629261/EP/1/3/EP-140629261.jpg", "height": 2538}, "updated_time": "2014-06-29T10:10:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "tbo.com", "description": "The coming of Independence Day means fireworks season \u2014 and the beginning of the institutionalized charade behind their sale in Florida.", "title": "Patriotism as pest control: Florida\u2019s weird fireworks law", "image": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20140629/ARTICLE/140629261/AR/0/AR-140629261.jpg", "site": "@TBOcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2014-06-29T01:00:00Z-04", "modified_time": "2014-06-29T10:10:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "fireworks"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWith the expansion of consumer fireworks sales in Florida, there should not be a critter left alive there,\u201d Heckman said.\nIn fact, the only legislation introduced this year essentially would have legalized consumer fireworks.\nForty-six states allow at least some consumer fireworks, often through exemptions or other loopholes.\nFour states \u2014 Delaware, Massachusetts, New Jersey and New York \u2014 ban all consumer fireworks.\nTechnically speaking, consumer fireworks are illegal in Florida."}
