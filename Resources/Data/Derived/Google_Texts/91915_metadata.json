Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) and John Barrasso (R-Wyo.) asked Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Administrator Marilyn Tavenner for updated figures by September 9. Their letter to Tavenner noted that the last update the administration gave was on May 1, when it claimed 8.1 million enrollees.\n\n\u201cSince the last enrollment report issued by CMS, numerous investigations raise questions about the accuracy of the enrollment figures trumpeted by the administration in May,\u201d they wrote.\n\nEven when the 8.1 million number was announced, many Republicans raised questions about whether enrollment only counted people who bought a plan, or a wider group of people who signed up but had yet to pay.\n\nIn the nearly four months since then, a major looming question is whether all 8.1 million people \u201cenrolled\u201d in May are actually paying insurance premiums. Earlier this month, reports began emerging that many insurance companies were seeing people drop out of their plan after they first signed up.\n\nFor example, Investor\u2019s Business Daily reported that Aetna, the country\u2019s third-largest insurer, had just 600,000 people paying into an Obamacare plan, after originally signing up 720,000 people. The publication said that Aetna believed the number could drop further by the end of 2014.\n\nAnother insurer, Cigna, said it expected to lose about 20,000 enrollees.\n\nIn addition to raising questions about current enrollee totals under Obamacare, these reports have led to related questions about the health status of those still enrolled. One key to making Obamacare work, many experts say, is ensuring enough healthy people are signed up to offset costs associated with treating those who need care.\n\nAlexander and Barrasso\u2019s letter cited several other factors that could be leading to lower enrollment numbers. One is a recent report from the Department of Health and Human Service\u2019s Office of Inspector General, which found that Obamacare was having problems determining whether people are eligible for health care subsidies.\n\nIf people qualify for fewer subsidies, that could make it harder for them to afford health plans, which could lead to another drop in enrollment.\n\nThe senators noted a related issue, which is a July report from the Government Accountability Office saying that GAO created 12 fictitious applicants, and that 11 of them were able to sign up for coverage. That could be a sign that the 8.1 million enrollment number is inflated, if it\u2019s found later that many applicants are not legitimate.\n\n\u201cFinally, your own agency recently acknowledged that over 300,000 people have not responded to problems found with their immigration and citizenship status,\u201d the letter added. \u201cDespite repeated efforts to contact these individuals, they have not provided the documentation to prove that they can legally receive plans through the exchanges.\u201d\n\nThe next open enrollment period starts in mid-November, and the two senators said it is \u201cimperative\u201d that CMS provide updated enrollment numbers before then.\n\nSpecifically, they asked for updated enrollment numbers as of August 15 and how many people have signed up but then later failed to pay the first month\u2019s insurance premium. The letter also asked how many paid their first month\u2019s premium, but then failed to pay premiums in later months.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "gplus-count": 0, "twitter": {"description": "Two Republican senators are demanding that the Obama administration provide an update on the number of Obamacare enrollees, after several indications that the number could be far lower than the number claimed by officials back in May.
