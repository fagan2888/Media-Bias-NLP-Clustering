This Outrageous Story Shows Why Marijuana Must Be Legalized in All 50 States

What do you think of this? Despicable and outrageous, or just the school and police doing their duty?:

On March 24, cannabis oil activist Shona Banda‘s life was flipped upside-down after her son was taken from her by the State of Kansas. The ordeal started when counselors at her 11-year-old son’s school conducted a drug education class. Her son, who had previously lived in Colorado for a period of time, disagreed with some of the anti-pot points that were being made by school officials.

The school called the police. Coppers showed up at Shona's home, searched everything, and ended up finding two ounces of cannabis oil which she uses to treat her Crohn's disease. The result? She could lose her child -- her ex has already been granted temporary custody of her son -- and Shona faces the battle of her life.

If this horrendous story doesn't convince you that marijuana should be legalized, I don't know what will. It's absolutely insane that Shona and many others like her are treated like psychopathic mass murderers, just because they use cannabis to treat an illness and because they believe others should be allowed to do the same.

Here's the video of this ridiculous search:
