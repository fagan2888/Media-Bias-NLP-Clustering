The largest was in Arkansas where it dropped 10.1 percent and in Kentucky where it dropped 8.5 percent.\n\nNew Mexico\u2019s uninsured ranking still is relatively high at 15.2 percent.\n\nOne thing all of the top-ten states had in common was they accepted both a Medicaid expansion and a state exchange. New Mexico is in the process of setting up a state exchange, though it used the federal exchange for individuals in 2013. New Mexico will have to stay using the federal exchange through 2015.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t an anomaly that those who accepted the Medicaid expansion had larger drops.\n\n\n\nAs Gallup previously reported, the states that chose to expand Medicaid and set up their own health exchanges had a lower uninsured rate to begin with: 16.1% compared with 18.7% for the remaining states \u2014 a difference of 2.6 percentage points. The already notable gap between the two groups of states widened through the first quarter to 4.3 points, as states that have implemented these core mechanisms of the Affordable Care Act reduced their uninsured rates three times more than states that did not implement these core mechanisms.\n\nOf the states in the region, the three with the largest drops accepted the Medicaid expansion \u2014 New Mexico and Colorado. Colorado dropped its uninsured rate 6 percentage points and Nevada\u2019s dropped 4 percentage points.\n\nArizona\u2019s uninsured rate dropped 3.2 percentage points, Texas dropped its rate 3 percentage points and Utah\u2019s remained unchanged.\n\nUtah is considering expanding Medicaid.\n\nTexas remains the state with the highest rate of uninsured at 24 percent. New Mexico leapfrogged several states in the bottom of the rankings.\n\nFrom the Gallup methodology:\n\n\n\nResults are based on telephone interviews conducted as part of the Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index survey Jan. 2-Dec. 29, 2013, with a random sample of 178,068 adults, aged 18 and older, living in all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia. A total of 88,678 respondents were interviewed Jan. 2-June 30, 2014. The 2013 margin of sampling error for most states is \u00b11 to \u00b12 percentage points, but it is as high as \u00b13.5 points for states with smaller population sizes, such as Wyoming, North Dakota, South Dakota, Delaware, and Hawaii. For midyear 2014 results, the error range increases to as high as \u00b15.0 points for these smallest states.\n\nPost updated for clarity", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "New Mexico Telegram", "description": "A Gallup poll found that New Mexico had one of the largest drops in the rate of uninsured in the nation.
