Read on to learn not only about the incredibly dark tone, but also the interesting period setting of the film and where the filmmaker started putting together the all-star cast.\n\n\n\nAfter Crazy Heart, I\u0092m sure you had tons of options on the table that you could\u0092ve done. What was it about this one?\n\n\n\nIt was an embarrassment of riches, and it was daunting, and all things I didn\u0092t write, and this particular project originated with another script that I thought was well written, but I didn\u0092t want to direct, and Misters DiCaprio and Scott, Ridley Scott said to me, why don\u0092t you just tell, have carte blanche with the script, and tell a story that just surrounds a man who gets out of prison and the loss of his brother and I thought, I can do that, but I have to personalize it, and then through great pain and hardship, do you bring your personal life to a story that well was represented by what you saw yesterday. So, but you know, it\u0092s certainly a very original piece but one that\u0092s personal and any time you put out a very personal story, it\u0092s very harrowing to see it\u0092s reception. Fortunately, I don\u0092t read film criticism because I\u0092m sure, movies like this are divisive, but it feels very good to express myself in this way.\n\n\n\nAnd what was it about the original script that you didn\u0092t necessarily connect with?\n\n\n\nOh, I just didn\u0092t connect on an emotional level with the characters or the time period or the world, and you know, was struggling with what I wanted to tell, but because I\u0092ve known people in my personal life who have been to prison, that I could start from that seed and then just really tell a story about what we as Americans have been undergoing these past five turbulent years, crumbling economy, fighting wars on two fronts, soldiers returning with PTSD.\n\n\n\nAnd it\u0092s interesting that it\u0092s set in 2008, and you have that scene with Kennedy on the screen.\n\n\n\nI wrote that specifically.\n\n\n\nCan you talk a little about leading to that specific time period?\n\n\n\nWe all came into 2008 with a great deal of hope, and it\u0092s now 2013 and while some of that hope has been met, we have a very divisive congress.\n\n\n\nIt\u0092s a split country.\n\n\n\nFor sure, and the affordable care act that we all want to work and we hope works, but we want our representatives to be more responsible. We\u0092re living in a very violent nation where guns are too easily accessible, high capacity magazines, and we are allowing our nation to almost default and it feels like there needs to be more accountability, so I feel this obligation to write and direct a film about that, for better or worse, and who knows how people respond to that. I\u0092ve been fortunate that people have seemed to embrace the film, whether you, Eric, embrace the film or you distain it, I never want you to be indifferent to the film.\n\n\n\nIt\u0092s about getting a reaction out of the audience.\n\n\n\nThere\u0092s nothing worse than going to see a film and then turning to my wife as soon as it\u0092s over and saying, \"So, what are we eating?\"\n\nContinued On Next Page > Tweet Scott Cooper didn\u0092t mess around when it came to constructing the tone of his new film Out of the Furnace.
