The White House denounced the GOP\u2019s latest effort to undercut the international negotiations as a \u201crush to war.\u201d Vice President Biden, president of the Senate, responded to the open letter with a statement declaring it \u201cbeneath the dignity of an institution I revere.\u201d\n\nMonday\u2019s open letter from 47 GOP senators marked an unusually public and aggressive attempt to undermine Obama and five world powers as negotiators try to strike an initial deal by the end of March to limit Iran\u2019s nuclear programs.\n\nRepublicans say a deal would be insufficient and unenforceable, and they have made a series of proposals to undercut or block it \u2014 from requiring Senate say-so on any agreement to ordering new penalty sanctions against Iran or even making a pre-emptive declaration of war.\n\nObama, noting that some in Iran also want no part of any deal, said: \u201cI think it\u2019s somewhat ironic that some members of Congress want to make common cause with the hardliners in Iran. It\u2019s an unusual coalition.\u201d\n\nThe letter was written by freshman Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, who opposes negotiations with Iran. It\u2019s addressed to the \u201cLeaders of the Islamic Republic of Iran\u201d and presents itself as a constitutional primer to the government of an American adversary. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky\u2019s signature is on it, as are those of several prospective presidential candidates.\n\nIranian Foreign Minister Mohammed Javad Zarif responded via state media, dismissing the letter as a \u201cpropaganda ploy\u201d and noting that many international deals are \u201cmere executive agreements.\u201dExplaining the difference between a Senate-ratified treaty and a mere agreement between Obama and Iran\u2019s Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the senators warned, \u201cThe next president could revoke such an executive agreement with the stroke of a pen, and future Congresses could modify the terms of the agreement at any time.\u201d\n\nIranian Foreign Minister Mohammed Javad Zarif responded via state media, dismissing the letter as a \u201cpropaganda ploy\u201d and noting that many international deals are \u201cmere executive agreements.\u201d He suggested the senators were undermining not only the prospective deal with Iran but other international agreements as well.\n\nWith Cotton presiding over the Senate on Monday, Democratic leader Harry Reid spoke out, saying Republicans were driven by animosity toward Obama and unwilling to recognize that American voters had twice elected him president.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s be very clear: Republicans are undermining our commander-in-chief while empowering the ayatollahs,\u201d Reid said.\n\n\u201cRepublicans don\u2019t know how to do anything other than juvenile political attacks against the president,\u201d the 75-year-old Reid said with the 37-year-old Cotton listening.\n\nThe Republicans\u2019 move to stop a nuclear deal with Iran comes just days after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke to a joint meeting of Congress at Republican House Speaker John Boehner\u2019s invitation. In his address, Netanyahu bluntly warned the United States that a deal would pave Iran\u2019s path to a nuclear bomb.\n\nThe White House denounced Cotton\u2019s letter, saying it was part of an ongoing partisan strategy to undermine the president\u2019s ability to conduct foreign policy.\n\nVice President Joe Biden released a statement saying, \u201cIn thirty-six years in the United States Senate, I cannot recall another instance in which senators wrote directly to advise another country \u2014 much less a longtime foreign adversary \u2014 that the president does not have the constitutional authority to reach a meaningful understanding with them.\n\nBiden added, \u201cThe decision to undercut our president and circumvent our constitutional system offends me as a matter of principle.\u201d\n\nBiden statement on Senate GOP Iran letter pic.twitter.com/hFKsxfCC5Y \u2014 Zeke Miller (@ZekeJMiller) March 10, 2015\n\nPress secretary Josh Earnest said \u201cthe rush to war, or at least the rush to the military option, that many Republicans are advocating is not at all in the best interest of the United States.\u201d\n\nNot all Republican senators are united. One significant signature missing from Monday\u2019s letter was Bob Corker of Tennessee, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman. Action on any new legislation challenging the administration\u2019s strategy would be likely to begin with him.\n\nStill, even if all parties to the international talks reject the letter as a stunt, the mounting opposition to an accord could have repercussions. Negotiating alongside the U.S. are Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia.\n\nThe Obama administration believes it has authority to lift most trade, oil and financial sanctions that would be pertinent to the nuclear deal in exchange for an Iranian promise to limit its nuclear programs. For the rest, it needs Congress\u2019 approval. And lawmakers could approve new Iran sanctions to complicate matters.\n\nNuclear negotiations resume next week in Switzerland. Officials say the parties have been speaking about a multi-step agreement that would freeze Iran\u2019s uranium enrichment program for at least a decade before gradually lifting restrictions. Sanctions relief would similarly be phased in.\n\nIran says its program is solely for peaceful energy and medical research purposes. The deadline for the whole agreement is July.\n\nIn the letter, Cotton and his colleagues stressed that presidents may serve only eight years while senators can remain in office for decades. The implication was that without Congress\u2019 blessing, the deal could fall apart when Obama\u2019s successor is sworn in in January 2017.\n\nThe deal taking shape is not a treaty. Under international law, the provisions of treaties are far more binding than other agreements.\n\nBut by themselves, congressional Republicans won\u2019t be able to block an international agreement.\n\nMcConnell has spoken of action later this month authorizing Congress to take a yes-or-no vote on a deal. But that vote would be symbolic.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Alan Fram, Steve Peoples and Jim Kuhnhenn in Washington and Cara Anna at the United Nations contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Monday's open letter from 47 GOP senators marked an unusually public and aggressive attempt to undermine Obama and five world powers as negotiators try to strike an initial deal by the end of March to limit Iran's nuclear programs.", "pubdate": 20150309, "og": {"site_name": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "Monday's open letter from 47 GOP senators marked an unusually public and aggressive attempt to undermine Obama and five world powers as negotiators try to strike an initial deal by the end of March to limit Iran's nuclear programs.", "title": "GOP senators send letter to Iran in attempt to undermine nuclear deal; Biden calls it 'false' and 'dangerous'", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/164384036.jpg", "url": "http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/gop-senators-send-open-letter-iran-undermining-white-house-nuke-negotiations/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "Monday's open letter from 47 GOP senators marked an unusually public and aggressive attempt to undermine Obama and five world powers as negotiators try to strike an initial deal by the end of March to limit Iran's nuclear programs.", "title": "GOP senators send letter to Iran in attempt to undermine nuclear deal; Biden calls it 'false' and 'dangerous'", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/164384036.jpg", "creator": "@newshour", "site": "@newshour", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "fb": {"app_id": 114150878604116}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/newshour", "tag": "tom cotton"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Barack Obama, Iran, Mohammad Javad Zarif, politics, senate, tom cotton"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce0e5\"", "article_summary": "But by themselves, congressional Republicans won\u2019t be able to block an international agreement.\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Republican lawmakers warned the leaders of Iran on Monday that any nuclear deal they cut with President Barack Obama could expire the day he leaves office.\nThe Obama administration believes it has authority to lift most trade, oil and financial sanctions that would be pertinent to the nuclear deal in exchange for an Iranian promise to limit its nuclear programs.\nIt\u2019s an unusual coalition.\u201dThe letter was written by freshman Sen.
