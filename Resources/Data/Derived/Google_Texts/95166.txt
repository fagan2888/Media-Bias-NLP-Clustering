Just a few weeks removed from Chipotle’s pseudo ban on the practice, retail behemoth Target has bowed to activist pressure and requested customers refrain from bringing visible guns into its stores.

In a message posted to its website, the company’s interim CEO, John Mulligan, claims that while Target has and will remain deferential to local laws, the company “will also respectfully request that guests not bring firearms to Target – even in communities where it is permitted by law.”

Mulligan goes on to write that his company has “listened carefully to the nuances of this debate and respect the protected rights of everyone involved.” In exchange for their attentiveness and sensitivity, Mulligan writes, Target is “asking for help in fulfilling our goal to create an atmosphere that is safe and inviting for our guests and team members.”

In closing, Mulligan acknowledges that the open-carry issue is “complicated,” but still declares that Target’s leadership has decided that “[b]ringing firearms to Target creates an environment that is at odds with the family-friendly shopping and work experience we strive to create.”
