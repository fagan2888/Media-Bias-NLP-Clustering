John Thune (R-SD) told Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace in response to a direct question about raising gas taxes while the price is below $2.50 per gallon.\n\nWHY THIS MATTERS\n\n\n\nThe incoming GOP majority in the Senate has been busy setting expectations high with regard to its members\u2019 willingness to put aside partisan politics in favor of governing. A move to consider funding highway infrastructure spending by raising the federal gas tax \u2013 a move that can be credibly called a \u201cuser fee\u201d \u2013 would demonstrate a real willingness to take political risks in order to achieve a public good.\n\nRelated: McConnell Previews GOP Agenda of Compromise, Confrontation\n\nThe federal gasoline tax is 18.4 cents per gallon, and has been since 1993 without being indexed for inflation. The main reason the tax has held steady is the political cost of an increase in the cost of a commodity that a vast number of Americans buy on a regular basis.\n\nHowever, the failure to index the tax to inflation means that the revenue it brings in covers less and less of the costs associated with maintaining and upgrading the U.S. highway system. Add to that the fact that the legislation providing money for the Highway Trust Fund expires in May, and it\u2019s easy to see why some lawmakers believe it\u2019s time to drag the federal gas tax into the modern day.\n\n\u201cWe obviously have a big delta that we have to meet,\u201d said Thune, who is expected to chair the Senate Commerce Committee in the 114th Congress. \u201cThe highway bill expires at the end of May and there\u2019s about a $100 million shortfall over what it would take to fund the highway trust fund at the current level of operations. So obviously we\u2019ve got stuff to deal with here.\u201d\n\nWallace pointed out that Tennessee Republican Sen. Bob Corker, who was appearing with Thune on the same segment, had been a vocal proponent of phasing in a 12-cent per gallon tax increase.\n\nRelated: Government Leadership Is Now Top Concern: Gallup\n\nCorker, who has taken criticism from the right for willingness to increase the tax, jumped into the conversation.\n\n\u201cWe have proposed raising the gasoline tax user fee by 12 cents, also by offsetting other taxes that Americans would pay,\u201d Corker said. \u201cSo it\u2019s revenue neutral, but at least it would put our infrastructure on strong footing.\u201d He also said the revenue neutrality of his proposal \u201cseems to get left out of the conversation.\u201d\n\nThune said no decisions have yet been made about how the highway trust fund will be financed, but made it clear that he considers getting it done an essential element of his 2015 agenda.\n\n\u201cWe appreciate the fact that we\u2019ve got solutions that are being put forward,\u201d he said, referring to Corker\u2019s proposal. \u201cI don\u2019t think we take anything off the table at this point. I think it\u2019s important to recognize we have a problem and issue that we need a solution for and we need to look at all the possible ways out there that we can address the problem.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "A key Republican senator on Sunday refused to rule out an increase in the federal excise tax on gasoline as a means of funding needed infrastructure spending in 2015.", "title": "As Gas Prices Drop, Gas Taxes Will Likely Rise", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/01/05/Gas-Prices-Drop-Gas-Taxes-Will-Likely-Rise", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/04272010_GasPump_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/01/05/Gas-Prices-Drop-Gas-Taxes-Will-Likely-Rise", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/04272010_GasPump_article.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "A key Republican senator on Sunday refused to rule out an increase in the federal excise tax on gasoline as a means of funding needed infrastructure spending in 2015.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce2ae\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThe highway bill expires at the end of May and there\u2019s about a $100 million shortfall over what it would take to fund the highway trust fund at the current level of operations.\n\u201cWe have proposed raising the gasoline tax user fee by 12 cents, also by offsetting other taxes that Americans would pay,\u201d Corker said.\nRelated: McConnell Previews GOP Agenda of Compromise, ConfrontationThe federal gasoline tax is 18.4 cents per gallon, and has been since 1993 without being indexed for inflation.\nAdd to that the fact that the legislation providing money for the Highway Trust Fund expires in May, and it\u2019s easy to see why some lawmakers believe it\u2019s time to drag the federal gas tax into the modern day.\n\u201cWe appreciate the fact that we\u2019ve got solutions that are being put forward,\u201d he said, referring to Corker\u2019s proposal."}
