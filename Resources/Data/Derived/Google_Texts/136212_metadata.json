Their most recent survey from 2015 shows that 48 percent of the public holds a favorable opinion of the Supreme Court, as compared to 43 percent, who report a negative opinion.\n\nPew reports a recent decline in public approval, which it attributes to a sharp drop in support from conservatives after the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in the same-sex marriage and Obamacare cases.\n\nBut before you conservatives get too hot and bothered, note this: as recently as 2010, the shoe was on the other foot, when declining public support for the Supreme Court was accelerated by liberals, who then viewed the court less favorably than conservatives.\n\nNone of this is especially surprising.\n\nFirst, 70 percent of us, according to Pew, think that politics influences the choices justices make. And social science data corroborate the public\u2019s view, by showing a strong correlation between a justice\u2019s ideological predilections and the decisions he or she makes.\n\nSecond, 56 percent believe that that the justices \u201cshould consider what most Americans think\u201d when they decide cases.\n\nIt\u2019s true that canons of judicial ethics direct judges not to be influenced by \u201cpublic clamor\u201d when deciding cases. And indeed many college-educated folk share this view.\n\nBut when a significant segment of the public thinks that the justices make political choices and that the public\u2019s political preferences should influence those choices, it follows that the public will view the court more or less favorably depending on whether the court implements the public\u2019s political preferences.\n\nAll of which may have little to do with the legal questions the court is deciding.\n\nFor example, whether the public thought favorably of the Supreme Court after its decision to uphold the Affordable Care Act case may have more to do with whether the public liked Obamacare than whether it thought the legislation exceeded Congress\u2019s constitutional authority to regulate commerce or raise taxes.\n\nAnd so, Republicans and Democrats take turns yelling at the court, depending on whose ox the court has gored lately.\n\nSo far, so easy.\n\nBut here is where the sledding gets rougher.\n\nLong-term loss in popular support\n\nOver the past 30 years, the Pew numbers show that favorable views of the Supreme Court have declined from 64 percent in 1985 to 48 percent in 2015, while unfavorable opinions have increased from 28 percent to 43 percent.\n\nWhy?\n\nIt\u2019s not as simple as saying that the Supreme Court has gotten too liberal or too conservative, because liberals and conservatives have both contributed to the long, slow decline in popular support for the Supreme Court.\n\nPart of the answer may be that the public is simply fed up with the federal government generally, which includes the Supreme Court for reasons having nothing to do with the court specifically.\n\nBut something more is at work here, which has politicized the court in new and different ways. Just check out this political cartoon where a tree that has lost its leaves reveals twigs spelling out the faults of each of the government\u2019s three branches. \u201cIncompetence\u201d is the legislative branch\u2019s problem and \u201csecrecy\u201d the executive\u2019s.\n\nAnd the judiciary\u2019s? \u201cPolitics.\u201d But what does that mean?\n\nThe impact of the partisan divide\n\nIt is not just that the court or its justices have acquired an ideological bent\u2014we\u2019ve known that for a long time, and political scientists Greg Caldeira and James Gibson have shown that the public does not second-guess the court\u2019s legitimacy on that basis.\n\nIn a new book, Courting Peril: The Political Transformation of the American Judiciary, I argue that a combination of events generations in the making is turning the American judiciary into a much more political place, in which the public is increasingly skeptical of judges and their motives.\n\nThis began in earnest in 1987 with the Senate\u2019s rejection of Robert Bork\u2019s nomination to the Supreme Court. It was a nomination process so contentious that it inspired a new verb, \u201cto bork,\u201d defined by the Oxford English Dictionary as:\n\nTo obstruct (someone, especially a candidate for public office) through systematic defamation or vilification.\n\nThe new politics of judicial appointments have transformed judicial selection into an ideological battleground that gets amplified in the public debate.\n\nThe traditional media now explain Supreme Court decisions with reference to the court\u2019s ideological voting blocs; cable news stations such as Fox and CNBC report on the Supreme Court from decidedly partisan perspectives; while a new breed of citizen journalists offer a critique of the courts in a host of online venues that are unconstrained by the norms of traditional journalism.\n\nAt the same time, legislative oversight of such seemingly benign subjects as court practice, procedure, structure, jurisdiction and budgets have become more and more politically charged. For example, with the court\u2019s ruling on Obamacare impending, ideologically aligned interest groups clamored for the disqualification of both Justices Kagan and Thomas.\n\nThe public\u2019s confidence in the courts does not turn on pretending that sterile interpretations of \u201claw\u201d are all that matter to justices or that ideology plays no part in the choices justices make.\n\nBut the public does expect judges to be fair and to take law seriously. When people start to think that judges are nothing more than political hacks in robes, trouble follows.\n\nIt\u2019s not surprising, therefore, that Caldeira and Gibson have found that the court\u2019s legitimacy suffers when Supreme Court appointments proceedings devolve into partisan warfare, in which each side accuses the other of appointing ideological extremists. This creates the perception that the judiciary is peopled with zealots who are indifferent to law and justice.\n\nI don\u2019t mean to suggest that the court itself shouldn\u2019t bear some of the responsibility for declining public support. But it is hard for the public to feel good about its Supreme Court in a partisan climate this polarized.\n\nAfter Justice Scalia\u2019s death, for example, the Senate preemptively declared the president\u2019s nominee unfit to serve before he or she was even named, on the assumption that working together to find an honorable, politically acceptable replacement was impossible.\n\nLost in this partisan fecal fest is an important truth: capable, qualified and honorable judges are not unicorns. They exist\u2014and they are no less capable, qualified and honorable, simply because they do not always agree with each other, with us, or with the politicians who appointed them.\n\nThis article was originally published on The Conversation.
