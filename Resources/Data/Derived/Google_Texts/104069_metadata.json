Now a team of researchers who investigated Facebook and Twitter show that active use of social networking sites is inspired by exactly these narcissistic traits. In fact, having examined active use of Facebook and Twitter, the researchers discovered that, among those narcissists who are still in college, tweeting is the preferred mode of expression, while adult narcissists favor Facebook. \u201cPlatform differences explain the differences in active usage on Facebook versus Twitter,\u201d wrote the authors in their study, which is published in Computers in Human Behavior.\n\nPsychological Motivation\n\nA team of North Carolina-based social scientists recruited 515 college undergraduates and 669 adults, whose average age was 32, to participate in an online survey. First, participants completed a Narcissistic Personality Inventory, an online series of 40 paired statements in which the one that best reflects their personality is selected. Then, the participants recorded how often they tweeted and/or updated their Facebook status during a routine day. Analyzing the data, the researchers came to the easy-to-predict conclusion that narcissism appears to be \u201ca primary driver for the desire for followers, which in turn drives tweets.\u201d\n\nYet they also discovered narcissism to be a stronger predictor of active tweeting than active posting on Facebook. \u201cIn fact, we found no significant direct or indirect relationship with active usage on Facebook for the college sample\u2026,\u201d wrote the authors, who added, \u201c\u2026platform differences (i.e., microblogging versus profile-based) may explain the importance of active usage on Twitter relative to Facebook. That is, with Twitter, narcissistic motives for usage all manifest through tweeting while Facebook provides other mechanisms to achieve narcissistic motives.\u201d Because millennials grew up using Facebook, the researchers suppose, it is part of their social norm to use it as a simple tool for communication. Among even slightly older people, though, Facebook is not part of their norm and so they require a more calculating reason for updating their status.\n\nEven if age groups have separate preferences, both sites offer a maximum of attention for a minimum of real interaction and so provide a perfect playground for inherent narcissism. And speaking of status updates, a forthcoming study investigates social status as it relates to public behavior and arrives at a more interesting conclusion.\n\nBehavior as Status Symbol\n\nA team of researchers from Harvard Business School examined how people react to nonconforming behaviors, such as entering a luxury boutique wearing gym clothes rather than an elegant outfit. The researchers noted that signalling theory, which examines communication between individuals, suggests that a signal is only effective when it is both costly and observable by others. \u201cSince nonconformity often has a social cost, observers may infer that a nonconforming individual is in a powerful position that allows her to risk the social costs of nonconformity without fear of losing her place in the social hierarchy,\u201d wrote the authors.\n\nIn a series of studies, then, they demonstrated that under certain conditions people conferred higher status \u2014 and competence \u2014 to nonconforming individuals as opposed to those who behaved as expected. For instance, shop assistants who worked in a luxury boutique in Milan thought a female customer wearing gym clothes and a jean jacket was of higher status than a woman who was more \"properly dressed.\u201d Yet the researchers also found that such positive interpretations of nonconforming behavior disappeared in three contexts: when the nonconforming behavior was depicted as unintentional; when the observer was unfamiliar with the environment; and when there were no shared standards of conduct on which to understand behavior.\n\nSources: Davenport SW, Bergman SM, Bergman JZ, Fearrington ME.
