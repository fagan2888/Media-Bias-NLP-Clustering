I love tax,\u201d says the 20-year Hudson-area resident, mother of North Hudson Elementary School third-grader Blake and wife of local truck-delivery professional Jon.\n\n\u201cThe reward is making sure people are getting every dime they can.\u201d\n\nShe adds in an interview last week in her Hudson office at 1334 Hosford St.:\n\n\u201cSometimes people don\u2019t realize all the things that could impact their tax schedules. I had one customer who\u2019d gone to another tax firm last year, and when I asked her a bunch of questions, she was shocked. She said, \u2018Nobody at the other firm even asked me one question. They just took my forms and plugged the numbers in.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not Wendy Byl, a former longtime insurance-division operations director at CHS, the Twin Cities\u2019 Fortune 100 agricultural business-services cooperative. She\u2019s been specializing in tax and accounting for the past seven years.\n\nSo Byl knows well that when it comes to all things tax, business and accounting, God and the devil are both in the details.\n\nHence her decidedly client-focused, one-on-one style, backed by her constant habit of keeping on top of every new nuance in federal and state tax codes -- and changes in her clients\u2019 financial pictures as well.\n\n\u201cMy approach is to really get to know the people I work with and what their situations are. I believe relationships are really important -- versus talking to somebody really quick and then not seeing them again until next year,\u201d she explains.\n\n\u201cTax issues don\u2019t end between January and April, and one of the biggest things I see is when people make financial decisions before they know the full tax implications. So I encourage them to call me all year round.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd,\u201d she adds pointedly, \u201cI will be getting back to them the same day they call if at all possible. One of my pet peeves is when people don\u2019t call me back, so I know that people want a callback right away.\u201d\n\nThey also want a tax, business services and accounting expert who cares about them as individuals, not as a standardized collection of revenue-stream contributors.\n\n\u201cNo two people\u2019s returns are the same -- and that\u2019s part of the fun,\u201d she notes.\n\nMeanwhile, when it comes to her expertise, the calm, soft-spoken Byl is not one to trumpet her own praises. She lets her professionalism speak for itself instead.\n\n\u201cMy theory is that if a customer comes in, I can keep them as a client,\u201d she says matter-of-factly.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen some of the big tax firms\u2019 prices, and they keep getting higher and higher. \u2026 But I\u2019m not doing this to push through thousands of tax forms every year. My goal is simply to get to know my clients well and give them the most professional tax preparation I can at an affordable price.\u201d\n\nByl continues: \u201cIn fact, if a customer worked with a professional firm last year, we\u2019ll charge 50 percent of what they paid them -- and that price won\u2019t change next year by more than $5 unless there\u2019s been a significant tax change.\u201d\n\nPremier Tax\u2019s website -- www.premiertaxhudson.com, set to launch Jan. 11 -- also includes a portal where self-preparers can complete and file their own federal and state tax forms online.\n\nBuilt by the North Carolina-based Drake Software, the portal\u2019s online-filing fee schedule is highly competitive with other tax sites\u2019: Federal 1040EZ forms are free; 1040A forms cost $19.95; long-form 1040s cost $39.95; and the charge is $19.95 for as many state forms as a client needs.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very user-friendly,\u201d Byl notes of the website\u2019s self-filing option, which is accessible by clicking on the site\u2019s \u201cPrepare Your Tax Online\u201d link.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll help an online client if they have any problems. If a client wants someone to talk to the IRS for them to help them solve their problem -- or if they need someone to represent them with the IRS after they file -- we do all of that too. All they have to do is call us.\u201d\n\nFor returns that Premier Tax prepares and files, the fee schedule is based on complexity and the amount of time required.\n\n\u201cFor my tax clients, I have a price structure that\u2019s based on what we\u2019re doing for a person,\u201d Byl says.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty set pricing, but we also base it to a certain extent on time, so if I can get a client\u2019s return done in, say, an hour, I\u2019m not going to charge them for any more.\u201d\n\nByl works on an hourly basis for her accounting and business-services clients, for whom Premier Tax offers payroll management, bookkeeping, and start-up and small-business consulting for sole proprietorships, partnerships, LLCs and S corporations.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll do whatever a client wants us to do for them -- I\u2019m open to doing as much or as little for them as they want,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cBasically, we take the worry about accounting and other things away, so the business owner can focus on what they\u2019re best at -- namely, running their business.\n\n\u201cA lot of business owners don\u2019t know what they can and can\u2019t write off, especially when they\u2019re just starting a business up. That first year especially, they can miss a lot of things.\u201d\n\nIn both her tax and accounting/business services, Byl is always on the lookout for new tax-law curveballs, along with deductions and write-offs that others might overlook.\n\n\u201cThe IRS usually waits \u2018til the last minute to finalize new things,\u201d she notes.\n\n\u201cSometimes people who always did their taxes the same way in the past get some new form that they don\u2019t know what to do with. \u2026 There are also things like people who are paying rent that are not applying for a rent credit on their returns.\n\n\u201cA lot of people don\u2019t know if they could do better. That\u2019s one of the reasons we ask people to come in with last year\u2019s returns. The IRS allows you to amend for up to three years, and in Wisconsin, you can amend a return for up to four previous years.\u201d\n\nThis year is also the first that the full effect of the Affordable Care Act will be brought to bear on the tax returns of clients who didn\u2019t have insurance coverage during 2015, she notes, adding: \u201cI took a special class on the Affordable Care Act because it\u2019s so complicated.\u201d\n\nDuring this year\u2019s tax season, Byl will be ably backed up by a certified public accountant and her niece and business partner Cheyenne Evans, whom Byl has been training on simple returns for the last six months.\n\nThe bottom line for all Premier Tax clients:\n\n\u201cBillions of dollars go unclaimed every year,\u201d Byl says. \u201cWe help people get as much of that back as possible.\u201d\n\nFor more information, go to the Premier Tax website, stop in -- the office is located just off Heggen Street near the main Hudson post office -- or call (715) 808-0082.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "News,business,news,Business,finances,social,taxes", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Chuck Nowlen", "og": {"site_name": "Hudson Star Observer", "description": "Good news in Hudson as this year\u2019s annual tax panic starts to heat up: Tax pro Wendy Byl is one of us and gets to know her clients like friends; she\u2019s got 25 years of high-level experience; and she\u2019s gifted at squeezing every penny out of individual and business returns.
