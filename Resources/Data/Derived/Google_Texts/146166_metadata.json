In 2009, the Dow Jones industrial average had fallen below 7,000; now it\u2019s above 18,000. And yet, as CNBC pointed out in September, the percent of Americans who hold stock either directly or indirectly is at an 18-year low while \u201cstock ownership for the wealthy is at a new high,\u201d based on 2012 data. As CNBC reported:\n\n\u201cIn 2010, the latest period available, the top 10 percent of Americans by net worth held 81 percent of all directly held or indirectly held stocks, according to Edward N. Wolff, an economics professor at New York University who specializes in inequality and Federal Reserve data.\u201d\n\nThe Obama years will also be remembered for the reshaping of our politics. There was the rise of the Tea Party and the demise of moderate voices. There were the unfathomable and indefensible rulings by the Supreme Court to bless dark money in the Citizens United case and the gutting of the Voting Rights Act in Shelby County v. Holder. There is an ongoing voter effort to shrink and restrict the voting pool as minorities are beginning to feel their power at the polls.\n\nThe Obama years will be remembered as a cultural \u2014 and legal \u2014 tipping point for equality for all people who do not identify as strictly heterosexual, arguably the civil rights movement of our times. The president signed the bill repealing \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell.\u201d The Defense of Marriage Act was struck down by the Supreme Court.\n\nAnd in 2012, Obama became the first sitting president to support same-sex marriage (a book by David Axelrod even claims that the president was in favor of same-sex marriage, long before he publicly proclaimed it, and indeed when he was publicly saying that he wasn\u2019t). When Obama took office, same-sex marriage was rare; now it\u2019s legal in 37 states. And a case now before the Supreme Court could determine whether it will be legal nationally.\n\nThe New Republic even dubbed Obama the \u201cGay-Rights President,\u201d and it is hard to argue with that.\n\nThe Obama years will also be remembered for his signature legislation \u2014 the Affordable Care Act. This week, the president said that 11.4 million people had signed up for insurance or renewed coverage under the plan. Needless to say, the program is reducing the number of people who are uninsured but it also appears to be lowering medical costs.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nYet the future of the act is unclear. There is a case (King v. Burwell) before the Supreme Court \u2014 a laughable case about a language quibble that may be the most significant linguistic imprecision of a generation \u2014 that could spell doom for the law by withholding subsidies from millions of low-income Americans to purchase health insurance.\n\nThere\u2019s the Supreme Court again. One could argue that the Supreme Court \u2014 the judicial Divine Nine \u2014 has shaped the Obama presidency as much as Obama has. That\u2019s not to say that he hasn\u2019t done an amazing job of shaping the judiciary in this country himself. In addition to appointing two new members to the Supreme Court \u2014 both women, a first for any president \u2014 he has completely transformed the lower courts.\n\nAs Jeffrey Toobin pointed out in The New Yorker in October:\n\n\u201cWhen Obama took office, Republican appointees controlled ten of the thirteen circuit courts of appeals; Democratic appointees now constitute a majority in nine circuits. Because federal judges have life tenure, nearly all of Obama\u2019s judges will continue serving well after he leaves office.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, Toobin laid out the diversity of the Obama transformation, writing:\n\n\u201cSheldon Goldman, a professor at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst and a scholar of judicial appointments, said, \u2018The majority of Obama\u2019s appointments are women and nonwhite males.\u2019 Forty-two per cent of his judgeships have gone to women. Twenty-two per cent of George W. Bush\u2019s judges and twenty-nine per cent of Bill Clinton\u2019s were women. Thirty-six per cent of President Obama\u2019s judges have been minorities, compared with eighteen per cent for Bush and twenty-four per cent for Clinton.\u201d\n\nThis is huge.\n\nAnd there isn\u2019t space in this column to address the many other things the Obama years will be remembered for: our engagement in Iraq and Afghanistan, the Arab Spring and the rise of the Islamic State in the Middle East, Russian aggression, moves on climate policy and the rise of American energy, the re-fighting of issues over women\u2019s reproductive rights and immigration policy, to name a few.\n\nWhether you agree that Obama was a transformational figure or how he ranks among other presidents \u2014 a new survey of American Political Science Association members puts him 18th \u2014 there is no doubt that the time of his presidency will be remembered as transformational.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "opinion", "ptime": 20150219032711, "twitter": {"description": "Wherever you think he may rank as a president, there is no doubt that the time of his presidency will be remembered as transformational.", "title": "The Obama Years", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/19/opinion/charles-blow-the-obama-years.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003521309"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "creator": "CharlesMBlow", "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/01/opinion/blow-circular/blow-circular-thumbLarge-v8.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/19/opinion/charles-blow-the-obama-years.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003521309", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/19/opinion/charles-blow-the-obama-years.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Feb. 19, 2015", "edt": "The New York Times on the Web", "org": "Supreme Court (US)", "keywords": "Obama  Barack,Presidents and Presidency (US),United States Politics and Government,United States Economy,Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010),Supreme Court (US),Federal Courts (US)", "CN": "charles-m-blow", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Charles M.
