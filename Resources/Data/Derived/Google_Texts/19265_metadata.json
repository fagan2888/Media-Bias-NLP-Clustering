Those conditions, which can arise from years of poor health habits, include diabetes, lung disease and blood vessel blockage.\n\nThe study, published this month in the journal JAMA Surgery, analyzed data on nearly 14,000 patients who had operations at 52 hospitals in Michigan from July 2012 to June 2013.\n\nDr. Darrell A. Campbell Jr., the chief medical officer of the University of Michigan Health System, who led the study, said: \u201cThe Medicaid patients were sicker, and they did not do as well following surgery. They stayed in the hospital longer, and that increases the cost.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMichigan has just expanded Medicaid, and nearly half a million people may become eligible for coverage. Since the state began taking applications on April 1, more than 237,000 people have enrolled.\n\n\u201cWe supported the expansion of Medicaid because it means that we can get patients into medical care and get them into optimum shape for an operation,\u201d Dr. Campbell said in an interview. \u201cBeing a heavy smoker predisposes you to get pneumonia after an operation. For a diabetic, if blood sugar is out of control, that increases the chances of a wound infection after surgery. If we can address these issues preoperatively, we can cut down the problems we see after an operation.\u201d\n\nDr. Campbell is also the director of the Michigan Surgical Quality Collaborative, which collected and analyzed the data.\n\nAbout half the states have expanded Medicaid, and the White House is urging others to do so, noting that the federal government will pay the full cost until 2016 and at least 90 percent in later years.\n\nThe Michigan researchers reported these findings:\n\n\u25a0 In the month after their operations, the Medicaid patients had two-thirds more complications and were more than twice as likely to die, compared with those on private insurance.\n\n\u25a0 Medicaid patients typically needed extra time in the hospital \u2014 three days, on average, rather than two \u2014 and were more likely to return after going home from surgery.\n\n\u25a0 Medicaid patients \u201chad more emergency operations and used 50 percent more hospital resources than patients with other kinds of insurance.\u201d\n\nThe findings have financial implications for hospitals, which are often paid less than the full cost of caring for Medicaid patients.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nKara Gavin, a spokeswoman for the University of Michigan Health System, said that many people who previously received charity care were now enrolled in Medicaid.\n\nPrevious studies suggest that many people will use the new coverage to obtain medical care for conditions that went untreated while they were uninsured.\n\nThe new health law reduces special payments to hospitals serving large numbers of low-income patients, on the assumption that many of the uninsured will gain coverage through Medicaid.\n\nBut hospital executives are unsure that the savings will materialize. Dr. Campbell said the cuts could create serious financial problems for hospitals treating large numbers of Medicaid patients.\n\nRecent research in other states has raised similar questions.\n\nIn Oregon, researchers examined what happened after the state expanded Medicaid to people selected through a lottery. Contrary to expectations, those who gained coverage made more visits to hospital emergency rooms, even for conditions that could have been treated by primary care doctors in the community.\n\nObama administration officials said they were planning a public education campaign to teach people how to use their new coverage, and one major objective is to discourage the use of emergency rooms as a source of routine care.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140517142723, "twitter": {"description": "A new study has found that, compared with patients who have private insurance, those
