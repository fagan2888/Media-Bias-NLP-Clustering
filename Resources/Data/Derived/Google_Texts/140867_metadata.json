Prior to Detroit, there was Stockton, California, and, according to Stephen Moore, now the chief economist with the Heritage Foundation, there are more than sixty of the largest cities that \u201care plagued with the same kinds of retirement legacy costs that sent Detroit in Ch apter 9 bankruptcy\u201d last year.\n\n\u201cKeep an eye on \u2018too big to fail\u2019 cities like Chicago, Philadelphia, and New York,\u201d he warned. Among the twenty cities he listed in an August 2013 Newsm ax article, he cited Compton and Oakland, CA, Harrisburg, PA, and Providence, RI. What these and other cities have in common is that \u201cthe vast majority are located in states with forced unions, non-right-to-work states.\u201d\n\nAs Steve Stanek, a research fellow with the Heartland Institute, reported, when a federal judge, Stephen Rhodes, cleared the way for Detroit\u2019s bankruptcy filing, in December, the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees (AFCCME) immediately filed a notice of appeal, but Detroit has more than 100,000 creditors. As its emergency financial manager, Kevyn Orr, said, \u201cThe reality is the city has no cash on hand to pay the magnitude of the debt we have, which is $12 billion\u2013$5.7 billion of which has to do with health care obligations, $3.5 billion has to do with pensions, and $2 billion has to do with bondholders.\u201d\n\nAt the time it declared bankruptcy, Detroit had 47 different public employee unions. The Detroit Water & Sewer Department had a farrier (a hors e-shoer) who received $56,000 in pay and benefits every year even though the city had no horses in the department.\n\nAs Moore points out, \u201cFor at least the last 20 years major U.S. cities have been playgrounds for left-wing experiments\u2014high taxes on the rich; sanctuaries for illegal immigrants; super-minimum wage rules; strict gun-control laws; regulations and paperwork that makes it onerous o open a business or develop on your own property; crony capitalism with contracts going to political donors and friends; and failing schools ruled by teacher unions, with little competition or productivity.\u201d\n\nThe legacy costs of pensions and health benefits to retired teachers and municipal retirees force \u201ccity managers and mayors are forced to lay off firefighters, police and teachers. Detroit,\u201d Moore noted, \u201chas three retired city workers collecting a pension for every two currently working.\u201d\n\nRecently published, \u201cThe Great Withdrawal\u201d by Craig R. Smith with Lowell Ponte examines the damage that progressive programs and policies have done to cities and to the nation. A nation with a $17 trillion debt who\u2019s President has only one answer, raise the debt limit, will encounter a financial Armageddon if the spending and borrowing is not sharply curtailed.\n\nCraig and Ponte point to 1913 as the year progressive, collectivist ideas \u201ctook control of the United States government and began a \u2018fundamental transformation\u2019 of our economy, politics, culture and beliefs that continues today.\u201d\n\nCiting Detroit as an example of the result of liberal, progressive policies, Smith said that \u201cby 2013 (it) had become a war zone of urban strife, poverty, decay and government profligacy.\u201d\n\nRecall that President Obama claimed he had \u201csaved\u201d General Motors and Chrysler with bailouts that cost taxpayers \u201cat least $25 billion that will never be paid back. At least a billion of these tax dollars went to improve GM facilities in Brazil, and at least $550 million went to GM facilities in Mexico.\u201d Chrysler is now owned by the Italian automaker, Fiat.\n\nBond holders are major investors in cities and corporations, but the GM bailout denied payment to secured bondholders and redistributed their rightful share to the United Auto Workers. \u201cAs a result, today\u2019s bonds are viewed as an investment with uncertain risk,\u201d says Smith. In 2013, investors withdrew $80 billion from bond funds.\u201d\n\nAs Smith points out, \u201cThe progressive method of operation was, and is, that when the economy is good, they raise taxes and expand government. When the economic cycle turns negative, the politicians blame others, refuse to reduce government\u2014and, increasingly, use the bad economy as a reason for expanding government and spending even more.\u201d\n\nThis describes what President has been doing since first elected in 2008. For the entirety of his first term, he blamed everything on President George W. Bush.\n\n\u201cPut simply,\u201d says Smith, \u201cmost progressive cities are welfare city-states in which a large percentage of the population lives on government money, either as government dependents or government employees.\u201d This description fits the nation as well.\n\nHow bad are the present times? \u201c27 percent of Americans have no savings at all, 46 percent have savings of less than $800, and 76% of Americans now live paycheck to paycheck.\u201d\n\nWith the passage and implementation of the Affordable Care Act\u2014Obamacare\u2014the Congressional Budget Office released a report predicting that, over the next decade, it will cost the nation about 2.3 million jobs and contribute to a $1 trillion increase in projected deficits.\n\nHans Bader, a senior attorney at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, notes that it contains massive marriage penalties that discriminate against married people, huge work disincentives for some older workers, has slashed hiring, cut economic growth, and induced employers to replace full-time workers with part-time employees. In the process, millions have seen their healthcare policies canceled or replaced with policies with higher premiums and deductibles.\n\nThere are already 92 million Americans who are unemployed or ceased looking for work. There are 47 million on food stamps.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://blog.heartland.org/2014/02/u-s-is-going-bankrupt-one-city-at-a-time/", "type": "activity", "image": "http://blog.heartland.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Abandoned_Packard_Automobile_Factory_Detroit_200-620x412.jpg", "site_name": "Somewhat Reasonable", "title": "U.S. is Going Bankrupt One City at a Time"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "In the process, millions have seen their healthcare policies canceled or replaced with policies with higher premiums and deductibles.\nTime to start watching U.S. cities go bankrupt.\nThe Detroit Water & Sewer Department had a farrier (a hors e-shoer) who received $56,000 in pay and benefits every year even though the city had no horses in the department.\n\u201cKeep an eye on \u2018too big to fail\u2019 cities like Chicago, Philadelphia, and New York,\u201d he warned.\nAmong the twenty cities he listed in an August 2013 Newsm ax article, he cited Compton and Oakland, CA, Harrisburg, PA, and Providence, RI."}
