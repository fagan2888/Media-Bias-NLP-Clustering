Popular street festival “The Heard On Hurd” returns to Edmond on Saturday, March 19.

The season opener takes place from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. in downtown Edmond, at the corner of Broadway and Hurd.

The event, presented by Citizens Bank of Edmond, will feature nearly 60 local vendors as well as live music from Graham Colton, Willow Way, and Daniel Walcher.

According to Jill Castilla, President and CEO of Citizens Bank of Edmond, Heard on Hurd is designed to promote and celebrate all things local—local food, local music, and local shops and boutiques. It’s an opportunity for friends, family and neighbors in Edmond and throughout the Oklahoma City metro area to spend an evening together outside enjoying live music, great food and shopping.
