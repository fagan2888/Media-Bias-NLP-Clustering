The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2006 recommended improved pre-conception care, including screening for obesity and education about its risks, they add.\n\nIn 2010 and 2011, to see whether women intending to become pregnant were better informed about the risks of overweight and obesity than women not planning a pregnancy, the researchers administered questionnaires to 1,726 women aged 16 to 40 years old from reproductive health clinics in southeast Texas.\n\nThe women were asked what they knew about the risks of obesity, their perception of their own weight and their attitudes about healthy diets.\n\nAbout half of the group was overweight or obese, and 126 women (about 8 percent) said they were hoping to become pregnant.\n\nAmong those planning a pregnancy, 31 percent mistakenly thought their weight was \u201cabout right\u201d and 47 percent thought their diet was healthy and saw no reason to adjust what they were eating.\n\nMore than half of the women planning pregnancy showed low knowledge of obesity risks in their survey answers. And more than three-quarters said they felt confused about what constitutes a healthy diet.\n\nThe level of knowledge about obesity risks and healthy eating was about the same among women not hoping to become pregnant.\n\nThe overweight women were much more likely to misjudge their own weight than were obese women or women of healthy weight. Some 71 percent of overweight women didn\u2019t think they were too heavy, compared to 10 percent of obese women.\n\nDr. Lisa Neff, an endocrinologist at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine who studies excess weight gain in pregnancy, said this study \u201chighlighted the gaps in knowledge about risks of obesity and pregnancy and particularly . . . about weight misperception among overweight women.\u201d\n\nBut, Neff said, many women simply struggle with slimming down. \u201cI think one important thing is that many women often come in to a weight management center with expectations that they have to lose a lot of weight to have a good health benefit,\u201d said Neff, who was not involved in the new study.\n\n\u201cDoctors often will tell people, \u2018you need to lose 50 or 100 pounds,\u2019 and that leads to this sort of sense of hopelessness because it feels like this insurmountable challenge. But in fact, the research shows that modest weight loss of 5 or 10 percent of starting weight can have a really profound effect on health.\u201d\n\nNeff said more dietary counseling is needed to explore what patients eat daily and to help them set small goals for improving their nutrition.\n\n\u201cThe trouble is a lot of doctors don\u2019t have the time we have in our clinic and also don\u2019t have the expertise in diet and nutrition,\u201d Neff said. \u201cIt goes beyond just handing someone a pamphlet.\u201d\n\nOne easy way to advise patients on a healthy diet, Neff said, is to show them the Harvard Healthy Eating Plate picture, which breaks down how much of each nutritious food and beverage should be included in a meal (http://bit.ly/1fAeOjs).\n\n\u201cUnfortunately many women do not seek pre-conception care where they would be able to receive information regarding healthy weight and a nutritious diet,\u201d said Ali Pohlmeier, a UTMB postdoctoral fellow and another of the new study\u2019s authors.\n\n(Reporting by Janice Neumann)", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "overweight, us, women, need, better, pre, pregnancy, counseling, study", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Better care and counseling is needed to teach overweight women hoping to become pregnant about the health dangers of their excess weight and the importance of maintaining a healthy diet, a new U.S. study concludes.", "title": "Overweight U.S. Women Need Better Pre-Pregnancy Counseling: Study", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/overweight-us-women-need-better-pre-pregnancy-counseling-study-341338", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/07/06/shutterstock229879537.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Better care and counseling is needed to teach overweight women hoping to become pregnant about the health dangers of their excess weight and the importance of maintaining a healthy diet, a new U.S. study concludes.", "title": "Overweight U.S. Women Need Better Pre-Pregnancy Counseling: Study", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/overweight-us-women-need-better-pre-pregnancy-counseling-study-341338", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/07/06/shutterstock229879537.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/07/06/shutterstock229879537.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Vitality", "published_time": "2015-07-06T11:29:12-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-06T11:29:11-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Better care and counseling is needed to teach overweight women hoping to become pregnant about the health dangers of their excess weight and the importance of maintaining a healthy diet, a new U.S. study concludes."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc99e\"", "article_summary": "The overweight women were much more likely to misjudge their own weight than were obese women or women of healthy weight.\nSome 71 percent of overweight women didn\u2019t think they were too heavy, compared to 10 percent of obese women.\nA new U.S. study concluded that counseling for overweight women would enhance knowledge on the possible health dangers of getting pregnant while being overweight.\nThe level of knowledge about obesity risks and healthy eating was about the same among women not hoping to become pregnant.\nMore than half of the women planning pregnancy showed low knowledge of obesity risks in their survey answers."}
