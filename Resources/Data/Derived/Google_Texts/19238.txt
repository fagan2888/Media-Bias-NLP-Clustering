Denver Public Schools has opened an internal investigation after more than $26,000 in direct deposit paychecks for seven employees were apparently stolen late last month.

Officials believe the funds were stolen through an email scam.

The inquiry first began on Feb. 27 when DPS was contacted by an employee who said their monthly paycheck was not deposited into their bank account.

“At this time, we have reason to believe that seven employees’ personal information was compromised via a phishing email that contained a link that asked the employees to provide their DPS username and password,” DPS said in a news release on Thursday morning.

DPS says they are coordinating with police who have opened their own investigation into the thefts.

“The DPS internal investigation also indicates that these seven employees are in a group of approximately 162 email accounts that received the phishing email,” the release said. “The 162 employee accounts that have been identified as at-risk at this time have been disabled, and the department of technology services is working with the individual employees to reestablish the accounts.”

Officials say they believe no other accounts are at risk.

DPS have been the target of a number of spam and virus emails in recent months, the release said.

“Today, DPS notified all employees of this incident, encouraged them to be on high alert for potential harmful emails and to routinely change their account passwords,” the release said.
