A quick review of recent press coverage would lead almost anyone to think that Head Start, Legal Services, community health centers, food stamps, ESEA Title I support for education, the Job Corps, and a host of other programs had no connection to the War on Poverty but materialized sui generis to provide vital services to the poor. To the contrary, these and an array of additional programs were conceived and started as components of the War on Poverty in the 1960s and somehow survived over the years despite attacks that started on Day One of the anti-poverty movement and never let up.\n\nListen to the array of people who inveigh against the War on Poverty and against the people who have been helped from sliding deeper into poverty as a result of the nation\u2019s tepid but nonetheless critical resource infusion to help the poor:\n\nAspiring presidential candidate and famous neurosurgeon Ben Carson recently denounced the Black Lives Matter movement as a distraction from more important issues of crime and jobs, but added that the $20 trillion he says has been spent on the War on Poverty has made dependency on government programs a multi-generational problem. Carson\u2019s op-ed declares, \u201cPoverty won. We lost.\u201d Any recognition that there might be something wrong with an economy that relegates millions of people to working poverty via minimum wage jobs\u2014with a wage most Republicans do not want to boost\u2014seems to be missing from Carson\u2019s equation, much less that the job training and job creation that needs to occur is likely to be, by necessity, government-funded.\n\nAn op-ed writer named Pete Mecca writing for the Covington News declared the War on Poverty an \u201chonorable notion run off the tracks by a sea of bureaucratic red tape fueled by taxpayer money.\u201d He went on to note, with some justification, that \u201cthe answer is and always has been training, education, and the availability of employment,\u201d but then implied that poor people are a bit like cattle: \u201cHonest citizens residing in poverty react to empty promises out of desperation. Such would be the case of any individual without hope or dwelling in monolith housing projects governed by drug dealers and wannabe gangsters.\u201d Mecca might have been usefully reminded that many of us who grew up in the projects found them quite different from the dystopian image he has painted, and despite the Pruitt-Igoe image that most people hold, many thousands of public housing units are well managed by hard-working local public housing authorities. Moreover, rather than promoting the notion that poor people simply react to whatever they\u2019re offered, Mecca might wish to know that some of the best programs created in the War on Poverty emerged from the ideas and advocacy of poor people themselves.\n\nIn the Rochester Democrat & Chronicle, a free market advocate on the editorial board, Jim Ryan, writes, \u201cInstead of promoting policies to develop the skills and the discipline needed to earn income and encourage self-reliance, the U.S. War on Poverty has featured programs with the objective of making the lives of the impoverished more comfortable. Although an admirable goal, when a welfare check equals a pay check, the incentive to work gets decimated and along with it the income necessary to escape poverty\u2026Unfortunately, the War on Poverty also creates incentives that have hastened the demise of the family unit.\u201d In other words, in Ryan\u2019s view, poor people whose lives are made \u201ccomfortable\u201d through antipoverty programs (meaning not starving to death, not having to live in a Hooverville, etc.) are going to stay that way. It is a blame-the-victim approach to poverty: People are poor because of their own choices, their own lack of motivation, exacerbated by the anti-poverty programs Ryan sees as negative incentives. Ryan does ask us to \u201cconsider that there are over 100 million working age Americans not employed today and the workforce participation rates have fallen to a mere 62.2 percent,\u201d though he might have recognized that the lower workforce participation rate is due to the Recession and the structure of the economy that benefits the people at the top and increasingly leaves those at the bottom in dead-end jobs or no jobs at all\u2014not because of anti-poverty programs. To his credit, Ryan calls for eliminating the \u201cbenefits cliff\u201d that affects poor people once they get jobs and begin to advance, a real disincentive for households at the margin, but his blaming of the War on Poverty for the persistence of poverty is totally misguided.\n\nA former speechwriter for President George H.W. Bush, Curt Smith, pursues with a vengeance the notion of personal choices causing and perpetuating poverty, with a specific reference to lawlessness: \u201cIn the 1960s, poverty meant a lack of food, shelter, and other necessities. Today it largely means a lack of respect for law, order, and human life. [\u2026] We have found that money alone can\u2019t stem violent gangs, same-color crime, or babies having babies. [\u2026] Finally, the war on poverty was initially waged, as King said in his 1963 speech at the Lincoln Memorial, not on \u2018color \u2026 but character.\u2019 Black leaders then, more than white, were men of the church, raised on the Good Book, intolerant of violence, and guided by a morality of right and wrong. Where are black and white leaders now akin to a [Whitney] Young or Billy Graham? [\u2026] In the end, respecting the law is the only approach that works. What won\u2019t work in any community are leaders more intent on condoning than penalizing crime, their slogans masquerading as thought. [\u2026] Despite the astronomical money spent, such indices as urban poverty, unemployment, and high school graduation are unchanged or only slightly better. Entitlement waste, temporary make-work, and children without a father have become several generations\u2019 permanent dead-end.\u201d\n\nA religious umbrella group called Circle of Protection asked all the presidential candidates to send in three-minute videos answering what they would do to help the poor and the hungry. Carly Fiorina, Bernie Sanders, Ted Cruz, Mike Huckabee, and even Ben Carson responded with videos made especially for the Circle\u2019s question, Jeb Bush submitted a stock campaign ad. Cruz declared the War on Poverty an \u201cabject failure\u201d and committed himself to, as president, \u201creward\u201d Americans who donate to Christian ministries, Sanders offered specifics on job creation, and Huckabee promised to save Social Security and Medicare. Instead of his campaign ad, Bush could have filmed a version of the op-ed he wrote earlier this year in which he asserted, \u201cWe have spent trillions of dollars in the War on Poverty, and poverty not only persists, it is as intractable as ever. This represents a broken promise. And it feeds the anger of Baltimore.\u201d\n\nThese and other similar statements in the press abound, shaping the public perception that the War on Poverty has been inconsequential at best and disastrous at worst for people in poverty. These people don\u2019t cite\u2014and probably haven\u2019t read\u2014the analyses coming from organizations such as the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities saying that a number of federal social safety net programs lift and keep millions of Americans out of poverty, notably Social Security, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (food stamps), the Earned Income Tax Credit, the Child Tax Credit, Supplemental Security Income (SSI), and housing assistance. We would add the new availability of health insurance through the Affordable Care Act as one more federal program that has cushioned lower income households from disastrous, income-draining, poverty-inducing conditions. Despite the evidence that millions of people would sink into poverty were it not for the safety net and various War on Poverty programs, Republican budget-cutters continue to take aim at gutting the budgets of many of these federal initiatives. Maybe they think that living in poverty is a preferred, sleepwalking choice for the millions of Americans with incomes below the federal poverty level\u2014that by slashing at the safety net, poor people will suddenly awaken to a need to leap out of poverty.\n\nMaybe these conservative politicians and commentators would better be served by some thoughts from Jay Bookman in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution who observed that today\u2019s Republicans like Jeb Bush have turned the War on Poverty into a war on the poor:\n\nPoverty, like national security, is not a problem that can be \u2018solved.\u2019 It is an ongoing obligation of a country that likes to think of itself as the most prosperous on the planet, and the growing divide between rich and poor makes it more pressing, not less. Furthermore, the \u201cWar on Poverty\u201d is not a failure when tens of millions of Americans have a decent place to live when they would otherwise not have one, when they have food on the table when they would otherwise have gone hungry, when they have heat in the winter when they would otherwise have suffered in the cold.\n\nWe know that human services agencies have long been promoting the notion of \u201creframing\u201d human services. The reframing initiative is \u201cin response to the threat of deep and potentially sustained cuts to programs critical to the human development system\u201d and aims to get national networks \u201cto deploy common messages to the Congress, the White House, and the American people.\u201d All well and good, and probably necessary, but sometimes reframing sounds like advertising, a search for the pitch lines that will resonate with listeners and evoke more positive reactions. That\u2019s fine, but something deeper is brewing when it comes to anti-poverty programs: a perception that the nation\u2019s poor and very poor have been made comfortable through government programs, that the poor would rather opt for continued poverty because of the comfort of federal programs, that their poverty is often by choice rather than by circumstances or other factors. The attack on the War on Poverty is frequently no more than how Bookman described it, as a war against the people who are poor. Sadly, that isn\u2019t just \u201cframing.\u201d It is ideological, often with an overlay of race. In addition to \u201creframing,\u201d there\u2019s a need for \u201cre-mobilizing\u201d and \u201cre-empowering\u201d the poor, as the War on Poverty was meant to do\u2014and prevented from doing in many ways\u2014so that the poor can tell Ben Carson, Jeb Bush, Ted Cruz, and others what they really want and need.", "article_metadata": {"description": "It\u2019s amazing how much press commentary there is attacking the War on Poverty as a 50-year failure\u2014in complete ignorance of the facts.
