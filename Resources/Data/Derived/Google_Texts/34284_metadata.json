Breast cancer was exactly that for me. I don't know where I mustered up the courage to reject most of the \u201cstandard-of-care\u201d treatments, like chemo and its harsh aftercare drugs. Instead, I made a deal with myself. I took a hard look at what I\u2019d done up to this point relative to my diet and lifestyle to play host to this horrible disease, and realized what I thought was healthy eating was in essence, not. I also didn\u2019t understand the ramifications of using chemical-laden products, like makeup and household cleaners, on my body.\n\nFrom that moment on, I decided I would eat as though my life depended upon it; that I would eliminate chemicals as best I could from every facet of my life. That was 15 years ago and I've never looked back. Doing so has taken away my fear of recurrence, because I know that I am doing everything humanly possible to avoid the environmental assault that is taking down so many. This is why I created SUZANNE Organics cosmetics.\n\nStudy your skin under a microscope and you\u2019ll find that what we know as little tiny pores actually look like giant holes. Keep that visual in mind and then imagine slathering chemical creams and lotions over them each day. It's not much of a stretch to realize that those chemicals and toxins can end up in your bloodstream, which then gives them a path to attack organs and glands, their favorite being the fattiest organ of all (the brain), which is composed of 60 percent fat.\n\nThis thought alone gives me peace of mind each day when I use my organic products, made with a variety of natural ingredients and enzymes, like African birch, which has been shown to regenerate skin, and CoQ10, an enzyme shown to clear free radicals under the skin and reduce wrinkles. Every day, I feel affirmed that I am steps ahead of all those who may have not yet realized that every choice matters.\n\nWe all have our individual \u201ctipping point.\u201d At what point does the toxic buildup in your body become overloaded, and you perhaps find yourself developing an autoimmune disease, such as fibromyalgia, lupus, multiple sclerosis; one of the brain diseases of today, like ADHD; or worst of all, cancer?\n\nI now realize that we are each individually in control of our health to a much greater degree than I ever before realized. A disease is not some ninja warrior out there who strikes rampantly; rather, we set the stage for it to appear with the choices we make. As simple as it sounds, organic skincare is a great place to start your transformation. How tragic would it be if poor choices resulted in an unwanted disastrous condition?\n\nMy health has never been better. I have energy and I am absolutely enjoying the aging process as a result. Health is all there is, and it needs to be valued above all else.\n\nA trusted health advocate, successful entrepreneur, and star of two hit TV series, Suzanne Somers has written 25 books, including her latest New York Times bestseller, TOX-SICK: From Toxic to Not Sick.
