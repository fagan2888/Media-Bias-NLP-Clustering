The Lokpal rift is wide open and a couple of tweets by Kiran Bedi, questioning the motives behind the continuing agitations against the bill, have just added fuel to the fire.

"Lokpal is certainly not a Jokepal!Those who term it this way perhaps want to keep d issue alive & not want it get started against corruption", she tweeted, leaving very little doubt on as to who she was referring to.

Her comments come in the wake of a series of tweets by AAP leader Arvind Kejriwal who alleged that Anna had been misled into settling for a 'Jokepal'.

"I m really surprised. How can Anna accept sarkari lokpal bill? Sarkari lokpal is a "jokepal". Who is misguiding Anna? None of the 3 conditions which were agreed upon when Anna broke his fast in Aug 2011 are there in this jokepal", he tweeted on Saturday.

The AAP leader has so far refrained from directly criticising any member of team Anna, but came close to it today when he retweeted one Amit Khalla. The tweet read, "@thekiranbedi is now supporting a version of Lokpal she herself fought against. Her website says so #CongressKraned"

Kejriwal also retweeted a tweet from the Aam Aadmi Party that said the party would now carry on the fight for a strong Lokpal bill.

This comes as AAP leader Kumar Vishwas told television channels that although the party bore no ill will towards Anna, that the movement for a strong Lokpal did not belong to him. "The nation does not want to compromise on the Lokpal bill. It doesn't belong to Anna or to Kejriwal", he said.

Anna Hazare for his part, said that AAP was perfectly welcome to start its own agitation for the bill.

"We have separated now and are walking our separate ways. If he and his party are unhappy with the draft, they can start a new agitation. I am not with them", he said.
