Stop apologizing and stop pussyfooting around with this language dance. We get it. Not all Muslims are terrorists. It was Egypt, the country of 90% Muslim[s], that rose up against the jihadists, who were also Muslim\u2026Mr. president, please identify what other violence is being committed against Americans in the name of any other religion, or, is it just coincidence?\u201d\n\nShe concluded, \u201cthe overwhelming majority of Americans think it\u2019s at least somewhat likely Islamic terrorists will launch an attack on US soil soon. But I believe you are so comfortable with extremism, that you\u2019ve lost an understanding of the danger to Americans. You boast a security policy of strategic patience. What are you waiting for? While you wait, they keep winning, and Iran gets closer to nuclear enrichment, all the while you open your borders, reduce our military, and criticize Americans and\n\nAmerica at the UN and in Cairo. If nothing more, you\u2019re consistent, extremism is just the part of life. But the danger, your nonchalant attitude puts our entire nation in jeopardy.\u201d\n\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett", "article_metadata": {"description": "Judge Jeanine Pirro criticized Obama's comments at the National Prayer Breakfast, declaring \"Barack Obama is comfortable with extremism.\"", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Judge Jeanine Pirro criticized Obama's comments at the National Prayer Breakfast, declaring \"Barack Obama is comfortable with extremism.\"", "title": "Pirro: 'Obama Is Comfortable With Extremism' - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 475, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/02/Pirro-27-Thumbnail.jpg", "height": 356}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/video/2015/02/07/pirro-obama-is-comfortable-with-extremism/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Judge Jeanine Pirro criticized Obama's comments at the National Prayer Breakfast, declaring \"Barack Obama is comfortable with extremism.\"", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/02/Pirro-27-Thumbnail.jpg", "title": "Pirro: 'Obama Is Comfortable With Extremism' - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "islamic extremism, Jeanine Pirro, President Obama,Breitbart TV, Jihad, Obama,Pirro", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Breitbart TV", "tag": "President Obama", "published_time": "2015-02-07T20:06:37-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart TV,Obama,Jihad"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTEROn Saturday, Judge Jeanine Pirro, host of the Fox News Channel\u2019s \u201cJustice with Judge Jeanine\u201d criticized President Obama\u2019s comments at the National Prayer Breakfast, declaring \u201cBarack Obama is comfortable with extremism.\u201dSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\u201cBarack Obama is comfortable with extremism\u2026it\u2019s part of what happens\u201d she declared.\nBut I believe you are so comfortable with extremism, that you\u2019ve lost an understanding of the danger to Americans.\nIf nothing more, you\u2019re consistent, extremism is just the part of life.\nStop apologizing and stop pussyfooting around with this language dance.\nIt was Egypt, the country of 90% Muslim[s], that rose up against the jihadists, who were also Muslim\u2026Mr."}
