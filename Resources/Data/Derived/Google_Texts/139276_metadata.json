Darrin Connall, rector of the Cathedral of Our Lady of Lourdes in Spokane.\n\n\"That was a pretty dark time, and, frankly, I think it was touch-and-go,\" Connall said. \"It was a nervous time for all of us.\"\n\nChicago Catholics react to selection for new Archbishop CBS 2's Jeremy Ross talked to some parishioners before Sunday Mass in Bridgeport.

Mike Savelesky, the diocese's vicar general for internal matters, said Cupich's successes have been very much tied to his discipline as a leader and expectation that others within the diocese would rise to the occasion as well.\n\nSavelesky recalled when Cupich was relatively new that he had tasked an adjunct ministry in the diocese with putting on a major fundraiser.\n\nAs the time of the fundraiser got closer, Savelesky said it became obvious that the ministry had not put in enough work to pull off a quality event.\n\nInstead of proceeding on a smaller scale, Cupich called the whole thing off.\n\n\"He doesn't believe in this privileged clerical class that can get by with whatever because they're priests, bishops or deacons or chancery officials,\" Savelesky said. \"He expects high personal integrity.\"\n\nSome parishioners, however, have not appreciated his approach.\n\nShortly after he arrived in Spokane, he caused a stir with abortion rights opponents by declining to endorse their curbside vigils outside clinics. His opposition also prevented local priests from participating, local activists said.\n\nIn a posting on the diocesan website, officials acknowledged that Cupich met with the group and that he believed the political environment around abortion had become \"very toxic and polarizing.\" He instead endorsed an education model that asked priests to \"create new openings for learning and reduce obstacles.\"\n\nHe also shocked many in 2012 when he filed a malpractice lawsuit against the firm that had represented the diocese and his predecessor, Bishop William Skylstad, in the bankruptcy. As part of the settlement, the firm had negotiated the establishment of a $48 million trust for victims, including $1 million for any future claims.\n\nCupich accused the lawyers of botching the bankruptcy by failing to financially prepare the diocese for future claims.\n\nSome parishioners said they were angered by the move, viewing it as a direct attack on Skylstad. They said they didn't see the need to rehash a difficult and painful time for the diocese.\n\n\"He's not my favorite,\" said parishioner Charlie Thomas, 77, of Cupich. \"I don't like the way he took off against the old bishop.\"\n\nParishioner Maura Dixon, who said she knows one of the lawyers in the lawsuit, said she felt Skylstad was \"more available to the people\" and that Cupich's lawsuit was unnecessary.\n\n\"It was a terrible time, and this just brings it all up again,\" Dixon said. \"It has been quite divisive.\"\n\nSkylstad said the lawsuit \"did not break\" his relationship with Cupich.\n\n\"People come in and have different viewpoints, and they have a right to have those viewpoints, especially as the diocese's bishop,\" Skylstad said. \"I thought we did the best job we could do under the circumstances.\"\n\nBut many in the church have supported the lawsuit, describing Cupich's tenure as unifying and Cupich as the kind of able and approachable leader that the church needed during difficult times.\n\n\"He stood up for us,\" said parishioner Colleen Anderson, 53.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "New archbishop praised for how he led in Spokane", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune", "author": "Chicago Tribune", "og": {"site_name": "chicagotribune.com", "description": "In this largely rural church between the Cascades and the Rocky Mountains, Roman Catholics say Chicago's next archbishop steered his own course \u2014 even when it meant risking offense or contradicting other U.S. bishops.", "title": "New archbishop praised for how he led in Spokane", "url": "http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-cupich-leaving-spokane-met-20140921-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-54202e07/turbine/ct-cupich-leaving-spokane-met-20140921", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp08.18", "twitter": {"site": "@chicagotribune", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "Chicago Archdiocese, Blase Cupich, Francis George, archbishop, Spokane Diocese", "robots": "index,follow", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=383137151, app-argument=http://www.chicagotribune.com/deeplinkid/81443929", "fb": {"page_id": 5953023255, "app_id": 306836229411287}, "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2014-09-22", "Description": "Catholics say Chicago's next archbishop, Bishop Blase Cupich, steered his own course \u2014 even when it meant risking offense or contradicting other bishops.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Chicago Archdiocese, Blase Cupich, Francis George, archbishop, Spokane Diocese"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd59a1\"", "article_summary": "\"He's a guy that doesn't shy from a fight, and that's exactly what the Catholic Church needs.\"\n\"This guy is not lukewarm about anything,\" said Rob McCann, executive director of the local Catholic Charities, the diocese's social ministry arm.\n\"And in the cycle of the Catholic Church, where everything moves at prehistoric speeds, that's amazing.\"\nHis opposition also prevented local priests from participating, local activists said.\nChicago Catholics react to selection for new Archbishop CBS 2's Jeremy Ross talked to some parishioners before Sunday Mass in Bridgeport."}
