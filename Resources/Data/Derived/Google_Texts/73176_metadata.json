For over 10 years now, I have been living under 24-hour police protection. I am on the death list of al-Qaida. The Pakistani Taliban also want me dead and terrorists from the Islamic State in Syria made similar threats. In order to be safe, my wife and I live in a safe house and have stayed in army barracks and even in prison cells, actually the same cells and beds where the Lockerbie suspects were held in the Netherlands. I am driven around in armored cars and even during TV debates in election time in my home country I have to wear a bulletproof vest. Leftist and liberal activists call me a xenophobe and a racist, and the extreme right calls me a Zionist and Mossad agent because of my love for Israel.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Daily Inter Lake", "description": "\u201cIt is an honor to be here, among so many colleagues.
