Even assuming full-time hours, that works out to less than the federal poverty level for a family of three.\n\nContrary to myth, two-thirds of fast-food workers are not high schoolers or college students, but adults who have finished their education.\n\nShockingly, more than half depend on some form of public assistance. University of California at Berkeley researchers put the tab for those benefits at $7 billion in 2011, with McDonald\u2019s alone accounting for $1.2 billion of that.\n\nAnd that price tag is undoubtedly increasing with the advent of Obamacare, which provides government-subsidized health coverage for those denied insurance benefits at work.\n\nIn effect, some of the country\u2019s largest employers are leaning on taxpayers to help compensate their workforce \u2014 leading Bloomberg View columnist Barry Ritholtz to dub McDonald\u2019s and Walmart \u201cthe two biggest welfare queens in America today.\u201d\n\nSuch stingy practices go a long way to explain why median family incomes declined 15% from 1990 to 2012, even as per capita economic output grew 60%, according to the Fiscal Policy Institute. They drive the rise of income inequality and the hollowing out of the middle class.\n\nYet these same companies lead the charge against hiking the minimum wage \u2014 even though the salary peg has less buying power today than it did in 1968, and even though an increase would put more spending money in their customers\u2019 pockets, boosting the economy as a whole.\n\nWhen McDonald\u2019s employees organized to fight for better treatment, managers across the country responded with threats, cuts in hours and pink slips.\n\nUnion organizers filed dozens of complaints, 78 of which the NLRB counsel is now pursuing as actionable violations.\n\nNormally, McDonald\u2019s Corp. would disclaim responsibility for the actions of its franchises, which are theoretically independent businesses. But the NLRB\u2019s general counsel says it has evidence of string-pulling from national headquarters \u2014 a hardball allegation that should throw a healthy scare into other fast-food chains.\n\nLet this mark the end of an industry\u2019s race to the bottom of the income ladder.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Editorials", "twitter": {"description": "The feds are cracking down on the bottom-feeding employment practices of McDonald\u2019s \u2014 and we\u2019re lovin\u2019 it.", "title": "Editorial: Up in McDonald\u2019s grill", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/editorial-mcdonald-grill-article-1.2055186", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2055185.1419378321!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/mcdonalds23-1-web.jpg", "site": "@nydailynews", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-author": "Editorials", "parsely-type": "article", "sailthru.credits": "NEW YORK DAILY NEWS", "parsely-pub-date": "2014-12-26T09:00:00", "parsely-link": "http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/editorial-mcdonald-grill-article-1.2055186", "parsely-title": "Editorial: Up in McDonald\u2019s grill", "sailthru.date": "2014-12-26T04:00:00-0500", "sailthru.title": "Editorial: Up in McDonald\u2019s grill", "nydn_section": "Opinion", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2055185.1419378321!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/mcdonalds23-1-web.jpg", "description": "The feds are cracking down on the bottom-feeding employment practices of McDonald\u2019s \u2014 and we\u2019re lovin\u2019 it.", "robots": "NOARCHIVE", "fb": {"admins": 1594068001, "app_id": 107464888913, "pages": 268914272540}, "msvalidate.01": "02916AAC0DA8B068EFE01D721E03ED7E", "parsely-section": "Opinion", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/NYDailyNews/"}, "sailthru.description": "The feds are cracking down on the bottom-feeding employment practices of McDonald\u2019s \u2014 and we\u2019re lovin\u2019 it.", "viewport": "width=device-width, height=device-height, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "og": {"site_name": "NY Daily News", "description": "The feds are cracking down on the bottom-feeding employment practices of McDonald\u2019s \u2014 and we\u2019re lovin\u2019 it.", "title": "Editorial: Up in McDonald\u2019s grill", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/editorial-mcdonald-grill-article-1.2055186", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2055185.1419378321!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/mcdonalds23-1-web.jpg", "type": "article"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "78efe4f5c9935744af497772f68a0ee7"}, "nydn_byline": "Editorials", "parsely-image-url": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2055185.1419378321!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/mcdonalds23-1-web.jpg"}, "article_summary": "While judges will determine the reach of the NLRB\u2019s power, McDonald\u2019s and many other fast-food giants have only themselves to blame for becoming targets of government intervention.\nContrary to myth, two-thirds of fast-food workers are not high schoolers or college students, but adults who have finished their education.\nThe feds are cracking down on the bottom-feeding employment practices of McDonald\u2019s \u2014 and we\u2019re lovin\u2019 it.\nFront-line workers at McDonald\u2019s make an average of just $8.24 an hour, according to PayScale research.\nThat move, if upheld by the courts, could make it easier for labor unions to organize McDonald\u2019s workers \u2014 and win better pay and benefits for millions at the bottom of the economic food chain."}
