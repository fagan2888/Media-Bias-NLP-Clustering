The second lowest Silver plan in the region including Birmingham is the UnitedHealthcare Silver Compass 3600 which had a price of $264. That was a 3 percent increase over last year's lowest Silver plan, which was Blue Cross' Blue Saver. The Blue Saver is now priced at $280.\n\nthe lowest Silver plan for a 40-year-old nonsmoker is Humana Silver 4600 with a base rate of $262 per month, up 3 percent from last year's lowest Silver plan.

That was a 3 percent increase over last year's lowest Silver plan, which was Blue Cross' Blue Saver. The Blue Saver is now priced at $280. In Huntsville , the lowest priced Silver plan is UnitedHealthcare Silver Compass 3600 at $254 per month, a 1 percent increase from the previous year's lowest price. The second lowest Silver is Humana Silver 4600/PPO, a premium which also saw a 1 percent increase from last year's second lowest Silver.\n\n, the lowest priced Silver plan is UnitedHealthcare Silver Compass 3600 at $254 per month, a 1 percent increase from the previous year's lowest price. The second lowest Silver is Humana Silver 4600/PPO, a premium which also saw a 1 percent increase from last year's second lowest Silver. In Mobile, the lowest priced Silver plan is the UnitedHealthcare Silver Compass 3600 at $242, a 2 percent drop from last year's lowest priced Silver. The second lowest Silver is United Healthcare Silver Compass 5000 at $255 per month, a 3 percent drop.\n\nOne thing to remember: In general, the lower the premium, the higher the deductible.\n\nFor example, in Birmingham the lowest Silver plan for a 40-year-old nonsmoker is Humana Silver 4600 with a base rate of $262 per month. It has a $4,600 deductible. By comparison, BCBSAL's Blue Value Silver has premium of $280 with a $2,400 deductible.\n\nThe estimated out of pocket maximums were similar for those two plans, $6,300 for Humana and $6,350 for BCBSAL.\n\nThe Times analysis showed in about a fifth of the counties in the United States using the federal insurance exchange, premiums for the lowest-priced silver plans will increase by 10 percent or more.\n\nMaine, Montana , New Hampshire, and parts of Mississippi and South Dakota will see rate decreases, the Times reported.\n\n\"Consumers should shop around,\" Marilyn B. Tavenner, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, told the Times. \"With new options available this year, they're likely to find a better deal.\"\n\nOpen enrollment at Healthcare.gov continues until Feb. 15.\n\n[SHARE YOUR STORY: What's your experience been?]", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "affordable care act, news", "title": "Switching health plans under Obamacare may be best way to avoid premium hikes in Alabama", "og": {"site_name": "AL.com", "description": "View full sizeHealthcare.gov website&nbsp; An analysis of new data on insurance sold on&nbsp;the Affordable Care Act exchanges shows that many people will be facing sizable rate increases unless they switch plans.
