And unless I can\u2019t figure out what the correspondent is saying because of creative spelling, I usually respond. Sometimes, it\u2019s just a \u201cthank you\u201d or a \u201ctake your meds.\u201d But on other occasions, the writer is so engaged and engaging, I like to initiate an epistolary relationship, which gives me enjoyment, enrichment and every now and then, material for a column.\n\nWhich, in fact, brings me to this one.\n\nThere is a gentleman out there who makes it a point to engage with me almost every week, telling me where he thinks I\u2019m right, where I\u2019m wrong and where to get off (and I\u2019m not talking about the Media-Elwyn.)\n\nHe\u2019s clearly a liberal of the old school FDR mold, but he\u2019s enough of a pragmatist that I\u2019m able to deal with him at a level that is often impossible with the progressive ideologues whose vocabulary is limited to \u201cBush lied, people died.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd it occurred to me that some of our conversations have been so good that they should be shared, allowing me to thrill half of you and send the other 50 percent into fits of apoplexy, solid work for a Sunday.\n\nSo here is the first in what promises to be a series of occasional \u201cPoint-Counterpoints\u201d with my anonymous liberal friend, a lifelong Delco native, who loves his family, his country, his church, and his Wawa, much like your humble columnist. Each exchange will focus on one particular topic, providing at least one more perspective than you usually get in a Flowers column.\n\nAnd I promise that not once will you hear, \u201cChristine You Ignorant Slut,\u201d except perhaps in the comments section.\n\nThis week: Obamacare, or as Antonin Scalia calls it \u201cScotuscare\u201d (I so want to marry that man \u2026 which I\u2019ll be able to when they legalize polygamy next term.)\n\n\u2022\n\nFlowers: So the Supremes, in the person of John Roberts, seem to have put the nail once and for all in conservative attempts to derail the Affordable Care Act. The chief justice held that we need to look at congressional intent when deciding whether a grammatical glitch in the drafting of the legislation justified gutting the law altogether. Refusing to allow it to be undermined by a thesaurus, Roberts wrote that \u201cCongress passed the Affordable Care Act to improve health insurance markets, not to destroy them \u2026I f at all possible, we must interpret the Act in a way that is consistent with the former, and avoids the latter.\u201d\n\nThe law as written provided for subsidies to those health insurance customers who purchased insurance on an exchange, but the words \u201cestablished by the state\u201d were seized upon by critics to try and undercut the law because less than half of the states have actually set up exchanges.\n\nFrankly, I think it was an ingenious strategy by some smart lawyers, but ultimately doomed to failure. As the Chief wrote, consolidating his status as enemy number one in certain conservative quarters, you have to look at what Congress meant and not what they, in their linguistic ineptitude, actually said.\n\nSo I\u2019m down with what he did in this case.\n\nBut hold on, friends. I\u2019m not too crazy about Obamacare. While the intent was noble, the implementation has been flawed and there are an awful lot of people, me included, who have seen their premiums spike. Many were kicked off their old plans because the insurance companies were forced to include such \u201cnecessities\u201d as birth control, which only qualifies as \u201cpreventative care\u201d if you consider pregnancy a disease (and I know some feminists do, but that\u2019s another column \u2026)\n\nThen there\u2019s that whole idea that a 26-year-old is a \u201cchild\u201d who gets to stay on Mommy and Daddy\u2019s policy, which would be great if that \u201cchild\u201d weren\u2019t getting subsidized birth control under the same plan. Frankly, if you\u2019re old enough to have sex, you\u2019re old enough to get your own insurance policy.\n\nWhat say you, my progressive friend?\n\n\u2022\n\nDear Counselor, I am sitting here at the Court Diner, on an undisclosed stool at the counter, left of center, keeping a low profile, while I quietly digest your message over my morning oatmeal - Justice Roberts did indeed get it right.\n\nThink of it. All these young folks who might not have carried insurance now do, because otherwise they\u2019ll be penalized. The low-risk pool pays into the system to raise the stakes for the insurance companies. Good for them. Gee, it sounds almost \u201cSocialist\u201d doesn\u2019t it? If it weren\u2019t for the people paying into the system, the insurance companies wouldn\u2019t exist. As for rates that spike, or the policy one wanted to keep was cancelled, that\u2019s nothing new. Perhaps those moaning about the loss of their old policy had a lousy one to begin with.\n\nAnd what about that outrageous statement, \u201cHealth care is not a right.\u201d Really? Tell that to the rest of the civilized world.\n\nThose states that didn\u2019t participate in the exchanges, basically took their ball and went home. Smells political, if you ask me.\n\nI don\u2019t want to get into the birth control debate with you, not over oatmeal. A rational person could say that birth control pills aren\u2019t a medication. I\u2019m no doctor, yet I do know birth control pills are sometimes used to treat medical conditions, like endometriosis (don\u2019t ask how I know that, but I do \u2026). Therefore it should be covered. Morality never stopped a drug company from coming up with a different pill.\n\nI do agree the deployment of the ACA was flawed on many levels But as they say,\u201dFreedom is messy.\u201d Just trying to be consistent.\n\nOh, and your concern about those young ones able to stay on their parents plan - bravo! That\u2019s the best part of the act. Young people today have a difficult time getting traction in this economy. Just look at how many jobs out there are hour-restricted, so that companies can avoid offering health benefits. These may be go-getters with multiple part-time jobs, but no coverage. They stay at home, save their money (hopefully), and remain on their parents\u2019 plan. Makes sense when you\u2019re one or two paychecks from financial disaster.\n\nAfter all, if you get sick, you can\u2019t work. Many of us 99 percenters are in that same potential position. Having access to affordable health care lends peace of mind. I cannot wrap my head around why this all had to become political theater. Boy oh boy - for all the attempts of the GOP to cut President Obama off at the knees, he managed to preside over some remarkable accomplishments! I know you have a pipeline to Reince Preibus, and get your daily talking points memo. He must be fuming. How can you top this? And what kind of name is \u201cReince\u201d anyway?\n\nI await the rabid commenters, those Cheetos-stained keyboard commandos. You know they are out there!\n\nRegards,\n\nLeft of Lenin.\n\n\u2022\n\nWell, LOL (Left of Lenin.) You make some good points, particularly about an economy that ties health care to employment. It shouldn\u2019t be that way, and liberals aren\u2019t the only one with compassion for the 99 percent. In fact, an awful lot of liberals are rubbing shoulders with Mitt Romney at the One Percenter Country Club, including Nancy \u201cDon\u2019t Read the Damn Thing Just Pass It\u201d Pelosi.\n\nAnd maybe the GOP has taken a particular amount of glee in going after the president. As they say, maybe they\u2019re just not into him.\n\nWe can agree that no American should be without health care. But this law was put together in the darkness with about as much finesse as Victor Frankenstein\u2019s baby. And conservatives shouldn\u2019t be attacked as heartless for wondering why the poor get helped, the rich don\u2019t need it and the middle class gets skewered yet again.\n\nThat would be you and me, toots. \u2018Cause we\u2019re in this together. Enjoy the oatmeal.\n\nWarm regards,\n\nStalin\u2019s Daughter.\n\nChristine Flowers is an attorney and Delaware County resident. Her column appears every Sunday.
