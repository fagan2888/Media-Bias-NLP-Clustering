The World Bank has estimated that remittance outflows will reach $586 billion in 2015 and grow another 4.1 percent in 2016.\n\nWhile developing countries such as Mexico, India, and the Philippines have come to depend on these funds as a steady source of incoming money, and a boon to their economies, some politicians are seeking to limit remittances as a way to discourage illegal immigration and to punish people already living here illegally who seek to send their wages to family overseas.\n\nSen. David Vitter, R-La., and Rep. Tom Price, R-Ga., introduced legislation early last year that would require remittance transfer providers to force migrants who wish to send money overseas to prove they are legal residents of the U.S.\n\n\u201cCracking down on illegal immigration is clearly a major issue in the presidential race, and a lot of Americans are expressing that, so this a commonsense, practical way to deal with it, to really dissuade folks from being here illegally and to capture that revenue and put it towards border enforcement,\u201d Vitter told The Daily Signal in an interview.\n\nUnder the legislation, people who can\u2019t prove they are here legally would be fined an amount equal to seven percent of the value they are transferring, excluding fees that are already applied for users of remitting services.\n\nThe money from those fines would go to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to help it pick up the costs of enforcing the legislation, and any leftover funds would be sent to U.S. Customs and Border Protection to help the agency secure the border.\n\nVitter and Price asked the Government Accountability Office to conduct investigations into the scope of remittances in the U.S. and how the lawmakers\u2019 proposed legislation would impact the amount of money flowing out of the country.\n\nIn seeking these answers, the government watchdog learned something else: that existing data regarding remittances is unreliable and that much remains unknown about the methods migrants are using to transfer money.\n\nFor one, the GAO discovered that the agency responsible for collecting data on remittances, the Bureau of Economic Analysis, isn\u2019t very good at it.\n\nThe GAO faults the Bureau of Economic Analysis for failing to use proper methodology in capturing the data, leading to missing information and measurement problems and lacking transparency in explaining how it collects the numbers.\n\nThis inaccurate data is a problem, the GAO says, because the World Bank and other international and national agencies rely on the numbers in releasing their own data.\n\nAnother challenge with tracking the scope of money sent overseas is that while most remittances are thought to be sent through formal channels such as banks, credit unions, and wire and postal services that are regulated by the federal government, some is transferred using informal services, without oversight.\n\nOne of these unregulated systems, known as hawala, has been the subject of recent attention in the media because of its use by people fleeing war-torn Middle East countries for Europe.\n\nHawala enables users to transfer money from one point to another without either side having a bank account, thus leaving no paper trail and operating outside the law.\n\n\u201cEven though there has been a lot of work done on getting the numbers right, it really is just estimates of estimates of estimates,\u201d said Hugo Cuevas-Mohr, a global money transfer expert with 25 years of experience in the remittance business.\n\nCuevas-Mohr, in an interview with The Daily Signal, said the best data comes from the major banks in the receiving countries and that some countries, such as Mexico, are better at it than others.\n\n\u201cThere are not very good channels of getting that information,\u201d Cuevas-Mohr said. \u201cSo the numbers don\u2019t mean much because they are a small percentage of what is really being remitted.\u201d\n\nIn one of its reports, released this month, the GAO speculated that imposing a fine on remittances against people without legal status could encourage them to send money home using unregulated services such as hawala rather than going through traditional methods.\n\nPeople using the informal services could not be subjected to the fines because there\u2019s no way to enforce them.\n\nSo if more people choose to remit using unenforced systems, the revenue generated from the fines would be minimal, the GAO predicts.\n\nIn addition, the GAO reports that it\u2019s difficult to know how many migrants use regulated methods to transfer money home, and how many go around them, so limited information exists about the immigration status of those who are currently remitting.\n\nCuevas-Mohr believes that the potential revenue from imposing a fine would not be worth the lost information about the industry that would come from people using unregulated means to transfer money.\n\n\u201cWhen you make it more difficult for those transfers to take place, then the market becomes less transparent\u2014there are so many ways you can move money,\u201d Cuevas-Mohr said. \u201cYou can have relatives that live in the U.S. legally and then visit their home country and take the money for you. I always tell regulators that if we open the door for everybody to remit, and make it easy to send money overseas, it will allow law enforcement to be able to see what is really happening.\u201d\n\nIn a separate report prepared for Vitter and Price, the GAO found that the large number of remittance transactions in the U.S., and the various ways in which people can send money home mean that the industry is ripe for fraud.\n\nRemittance providers have to report only suspicious transactions and create records of transfers equal to $3,000 or more.\n\nThe GAO learned that it\u2019s easy for people to avoid this requirement by using structuring, where they divvy payments in smaller amounts to avoid reporting.\n\n\u201cFederal agencies and international organizations have identified instances where remittances have been used to launder proceeds from illicit activities such as drug trafficking, human smuggling and trafficking, and consumer fraud,\u201d GAO wrote.\n\nLaw enforcement officials told the GAO that lowering the $3,000 reporting threshold would help remittance providers detect fraud.\n\nStill, most remitted money is coming from migrants who want to support their families, Cuevas-Mohr said, in increments so small that there\u2019s no reason for them to be tracked for fraud.\n\n\u201cMost of these transfers are very small and repetitive,\u201d Cuevas-Mohr said. \u201cIf you live in the U.S. and are sending money to your mother\u2014I am talking $50 or $100\u2014you send it almost every week or two weeks.\u201d\n\nCuevas-Mohr acknowledges that most people in the country illegally are likely remitting money if they can, but as they are here longer and become embedded in the country, they are less likely to remit.\n\nHe contends that creating hurdles to remit will inspire more illegal immigration.\n\n\u201cIf you decide that Mexicans who come here illegally should not be able to send money home, what about the sons or mothers who stayed in Mexico and can\u2019t receive that money? They are going to try to come to the U.S., too,\u201d Cuevas-Mohr said. \u201cWhy would we try to collect fines from people at the lowest echelon of society, make it harder for them, and push them to migrate because they are not getting the support from a family member to stay in their home country?\u201d\n\nVitter, meanwhile, argues that while it\u2019s tough to understand illegal immigrants\u2019 contribution to remittances, the move to discourage them from doing so is a matter of fairness.\n\n\u201cAnything where you are trying to track activity by illegal immigrants will be somewhat hazy by definition, but with this, they are clearly contributing to a major activity [remittances], and we should discourage them from sending billions out of the U.S. now and in the future,\u201d Vitter said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Two recent reports by the federal government\u2019s watchdog show that it's difficult to track the money migrants send to the country from which they came.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Two recent reports by the federal government\u2019s watchdog show that it's difficult to track the money migrants send to the country from which they came.", "title": "Why It\u2019s Difficult to Track Remittances By Illegal Immigrants", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/Remittances.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-26T13:50:22+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/20XLiGz"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Two recent reports by the federal government\u2019s watchdog show that it's difficult to track the money migrants send to the country from which they came.", "title": "Why It\u2019s Difficult to Track Remittances By Illegal Immigrants", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/Remittances.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "immigration", "published_time": "2016-02-25T17:05:05+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-26T13:50:22+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "remittance, Government Accountability Office, immigration, illegal immigration, David Vitter, Tom Price, World Bank, Mexico, U.S. Customs and Border Protection"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWhen you make it more difficult for those transfers to take place, then the market becomes less transparent\u2014there are so many ways you can move money,\u201d Cuevas-Mohr said.\nHawala enables users to transfer money from one point to another without either side having a bank account, thus leaving no paper trail and operating outside the law.\nTwo recent reports by the federal government\u2019s watchdog shed light on one of the more overlooked elements of immigration to the United States: the money migrants send to the country from which they came.\n\u201cIf you decide that Mexicans who come here illegally should not be able to send money home, what about the sons or mothers who stayed in Mexico and can\u2019t receive that money?\nIn seeking these answers, the government watchdog learned something else: that existing data regarding remittances is unreliable and that much remains unknown about the methods migrants are using to transfer money."}
