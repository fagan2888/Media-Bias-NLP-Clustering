This arrangement, which has been disputed by doctors forever, has finally been studied, thanks to new public data. And it proves what we knew all along\u2014doctors in the pockets of drug suppliers return the favor by prescribing those companies\u2019 drugs.\n\nThe Dollars for Doc study, carried out by the investigative journalism outfit ProPublica, couldn\u2019t have happened before, because it uses data made public thanks to the Physician Payment Sunshine Act, a part of the 2010 Affordable Care Act. This law compels makers of drugs and medical devices to publicly report any payments they make to doctors. The first data became available in 2014, and covered the last five months of 2013. In that short time, $3.5 billion was paid out to doctors. Ever since, Dollar for Doctors has tracked these payments, and matched them up with data from Medicare, which tracks which drugs are prescribed to over 39 million people.\n\nThe results show, with startling clarity, that the two are connected.\n\nDoctors who got money from drug and device makers\u2014even just a meal\u2014prescribed a higher percentage of brand-name drugs overall than doctors who didn\u2019t, our analysis showed. Indeed, doctors who received industry payments were two to three times as likely to prescribe brand-name drugs at exceptionally high rates as others in their specialty.\n\n\"It again confirms the prevailing wisdom\u2014that there is a relationship between payments and brand-name prescribing,\" said Dr. Aaron Kesselheim of Harvard Medical School.\n\nAccording to the figures, \"Nationwide, nearly nine in 10 cardiologists who wrote at least 1,000 prescriptions for Medicare patients received payments from a drug or device company in 2014, while seven in 10 internists and family practitioners did.\"\n\nBut Big Pharma disagrees. Holly Campbell, spokesperson for the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, told ProPublica that most physicians claim that a \"great deal of their prescribing was influenced by their clinical knowledge and experience.\"\n\nThe numbers contradict this. Dr. Amer Syed of Jersey City, N.J. took more than $66,800 from drug companies in 2014. His brand-name prescribing rate \"was more than twice the mean of his peers in internal medicine.\"\n\n\"I do prefer certain drugs over the others based on the quality of the medication and also the benefits that the patients are going to get,\" claims Syed.\n\nHowever these doctors justify their acceptance of these bribes, and their subsequent bias towards their benefactors\u2019 products, the fact is that prescribing brand-name drugs over generic is both pointless and costly. Costly to programs like Medicare, and costly to regular medical insurance companies, who pass that cost onto you, the customer. And generics are just as good as brand names, say studies, in both efficacy and safety\u2014generics must meet the same FDA standards as any other drug.\n\nThe only case where brand-name drugs need to be supplied are in cases where there is no generic alternative, such as some cardiovascular treatments, or in HIV/AIDS treatment.\n\n\n\nWhat will happen, now that we have clear evidence that doctors are influenced by these payoffs? Possibly nothing, at least not for a while. After all, the same pharma companies that are lining the pockets of the doctors\u2019s white coats are also paying millions in lobbying dollars to make lawmakers look the other way.\n\nIn the meantime, you yourself can do something. Dollars for Docs has an online tool where you can look up your own doctor and see if they are getting drug money, and if so, how much. Check it, and next time you visit your doctor, ask them about it. Perhaps pressure for the bottom will be more effective than waiting for the government to regulate such a rich industry.", "article_metadata": {"pubexchange": {"headline": "Doctors Who Take Big Pharma Money Prescribe More Brand-Name Drugs", "image": "http://d.fastcompany.net/multisite_files/fastcompany/imagecache/620x350/poster/2016/04/3058536-poster-p-1-doctors-who-take-big-pharma-money-prescribe-more-brand-name-drugs.jpg", "description": "New data shows the undue influence of money in doctors' decisions."}, "description": "New data shows the undue influence of money in doctors' decisions.", "og": {"site_name": "Co.Exist", "description": "New data shows the undue influence of money in doctors' decisions.", "title": "Doctors Who Take Big Pharma Money Prescribe More Brand-Name Drugs", "url": "http://www.fastcoexist.com/3058536/doctors-who-take-big-pharma-money-prescribe-more-brand-name-drugs", "image": "http://d.fastcompany.net/multisite_files/fastcompany/imagecache/620x350/poster/2016/04/3058536-poster-p-1-doctors-who-take-big-pharma-money-prescribe-more-brand-name-drugs.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "fastcoexist.com", "description": "New data shows the undue influence of money in doctors' decisions.", "title": "Doctors Who Take Big Pharma Money Prescribe More Brand-Name Drugs", "url": "http://www.fastcoexist.com/3058536/doctors-who-take-big-pharma-money-prescribe-more-brand-name-drugs", "image": "http://d.fastcompany.net/multisite_files/fastcompany/imagecache/620x350/poster/2016/04/3058536-poster-p-1-doctors-who-take-big-pharma-money-prescribe-more-brand-name-drugs.jpg", "creator": "@mistercharlie", "site": "@FastCoExist", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000062710915, "pages": 227383110655483, "app_id": 180431352040909}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/FastCoExist", "section": "Co.Exist", "published_time": "2016-04-04T18:40:00.000Z", "modified_time": "2016-04-04T22:07:43.000Z"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "Doctors who got money from drug and device makers\u2014even just a meal\u2014prescribed a higher percentage of brand-name drugs overall than doctors who didn\u2019t, our analysis showed.\nIf your doctor is getting bribes from pharma companies, they\u2019re much more likely to prescribe brand-name meds.\nIndeed, doctors who received industry payments were two to three times as likely to prescribe brand-name drugs at exceptionally high rates as others in their specialty.\nHis brand-name prescribing rate \"was more than twice the mean of his peers in internal medicine.\"\nThe only case where brand-name drugs need to be supplied are in cases where there is no generic alternative, such as some cardiovascular treatments, or in HIV/AIDS treatment."}
