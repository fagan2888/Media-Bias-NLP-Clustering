Students and staff of James Coble Middle School in Mansfield ISD will have Monday off as crews work to restore power to the school.

A transformer near the school’s campus in the 1200 block of Ballweg Road in Arlington caught fire Saturday, damaging the transformer and electrical wiring to the school. The school itself did not have any damage, according to a statement from the school district.

All before and after-school activities are also canceled.

“The safety of our students and staff are our number one priority,” the statement said. “Mansfield ISD maintenance employees, Oncor, and electric contracting crews are currently working together to replace the damaged wiring and the transformer so that power to Coble Middle School can be restored.”

Classes will continue as normal at all other Mansfield ISD schools.
