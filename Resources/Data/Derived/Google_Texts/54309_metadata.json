Scott Walker announced his presidential run to cheering supporters in his home state, promising to introduce himself to America as a fresh-faced fighter who would bring new passion to the Republican Party.\n\nThen came Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cHe can speak for himself,\u201d Walker told Sean Hannity on Fox News after his announcement, declining to discuss his rival.\n\nWalker no longer is ignoring the brash billionaire, whose steady rise in polls has forced all of the Republican candidates to reconfigure their campaigns. Walker joined the race just as Trump began his stranglehold on public attention, and he has struggled to draw notice ever since.\n\nThis week Walker all but embraced Trump by asserting that their hard-line views on immigration are similar.\n\n\u201cOne of the things you can\u2019t ignore is that he\u2019s tapped into something very real,\u201d Walker told conservative radio host Glenn Beck on Monday.\n\nWalker once favored a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. Now he says that like Trump, he would build a wall along the Southwest border and like Trump, he would end the right to citizenship for children born in the United States to parents who are here illegally.\n\nThe comments pushed Walker further to the right on immigration. On Tuesday, he followed up with more traditional GOP fare by attacking both the Affordable Care Act and the Republican senators \u2014 four are in the race \u2014 who he said had failed to get rid of it.\n\nThe speech and policy plan \u2014 the first of many, he said \u2014 are intended to recharge his campaign and convince Republican primary voters that he is the true outsider who can break the political impasse in Washington.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m willing to stand up against anyone, including members of my own party \u2026 to get the job done,\u201d he told a rally Tuesday at a factory in Brooklyn Center, a suburb of Minneapolis.\n\nUntil Trump\u2019s rise, Walker led many Iowa polls and scored well in national Republican surveys.\n\nBut a CNN poll of likely Iowa caucus-goers released last week showed him falling to third place, with 9% of the vote, behind both Trump (22%) and retired doctor Ben Carson (14%). Another CNN poll released Tuesday of national GOP voters had Walker at 8%, tied for fourth with Florida Sen. Marco Rubio.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s certainly some pressure here to recapture some attention,\u201d said Charles Franklin, director of the Marquette Law School Poll, who has tracked Walker\u2019s political career.\n\nFranklin said Walker was positioning himself for the long term, fighting with Texas Sen. Ted Cruz over who stands the best chance to inherit Trump\u2019s anti-establishment support if Trump\u2019s campaign falters.\n\nWalker\u2019s proposal to repeal and replace President Obama\u2019s healthcare law hews to general conservative ideas for expanding health coverage with Medicaid block grants to states and a simplified system of federal aid to Americans to buy insurance.\n\nBut the plan lacks many key details, including specifics on how it would be paid for. Any healthcare law that offers subsidies to tens of millions of Americans for health coverage, as Walker proposes to do, would probably cost hundreds of billions of dollars.\n\nWalker said his plan would be \u201ccost neutral\u201d because it would impose taxes on high-end insurance plans and save money by turning Medicaid into a block grant program for states. That approach probably would require huge Medicaid cuts, jeopardizing coverage for millions of poor Americans.\n\nIn his speech Tuesday, Walker said he had to coax reluctant Republicans in his state who \u201cdidn\u2019t want to challenge the status quo\u201d to join his fight against public labor unions when he stripped them of many collective bargaining rights.\n\n\u201cThat was the headline: 'Walker says it\u2019s put-up or shut-up time,'\" he said.\n\nHe similarly chastised Republicans in Washington for their failure to repeal Obamacare, a campaign promise that has galvanized conservatives but one that many party leaders have long thought unrealistic while Obama is in the White House.\n\n\u201cI want to be clear,\u201d he said. \u201cAmericans want more than just campaign promises; they want results.\u201d\n\nWalker\u2019s health plan promises to limit government interference while still ensuring affordable coverage for those with preexisting medical conditions.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how he would do that. Five years after the Affordable Care Act was enacted, Republicans in Congress have not advanced a single alternative, in large part because maintaining the law\u2019s current protections for consumers while also cutting costs is extremely difficult.\n\nDemocrats were quick to poke holes in the plan.\n\n\u201cIf this vague grab bag of conservative wish-list items is the best health plan the GOP can come up with \u2026 it\u2019s the clearest signal yet that Republicans like Scott Walker are out of ideas and out of touch,\u201d Democratic spokesman Eric Walker said in a statement.\n\nWalker\u2019s resistance to Obamacare is taking a rising toll back home, data show. An analysis this year from the state\u2019s independent Legislative Fiscal Bureau estimated that Wisconsin could save $360 million over the next two years if Walker agreed to accept federal aid available through the law to provide Medicaid coverage to poor adults in the state.\n\nWalker\u2019s proposal would maintain guaranteed coverage to Americans with preexisting medical conditions, a revolutionary part of the current law, though the assurance is more limited than what the law offers because it would protect only consumers who maintain continuous health coverage.\n\nLike Obamacare, his proposal would offer tax subsidies to Americans who don\u2019t get insurance coverage at work to help them buy health plans. But the amount of aid would be tied to the consumer\u2019s age, rather than income, with older Americans receiving more assistance.\n\nThat is a simpler system, but it could expose many lower-income Americans to higher insurance costs than they now face.\n\nTwitter: @noahbierman and @noamlevey\n\nMORE ON 2016 CAMPAIGN:\n\nTrump plan: Make immigrants pay for 'permanent border wall' and deport millions\n\nJeb Bush, seemingly perfect on paper, just hasn't caught on with GOP voters", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Scott Walker sides with Trump on immigration and offers alternative to Obamacare", "Description": "Only five weeks ago, Wisconsin Gov.
