(AP) \u2014 The federal government shelled out billions of dollars to get health insurance marketplaces going in the 14 states that opted to run their own. Now they must act like true marketplaces and start paying for themselves.\n\nUnder President Barack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act, state-run health insurance exchanges need to be financially self-sustaining starting in January. Some appear to be on that path, while others have shaky funding models or even none at all.\n\nSome states, prohibited from using state money, are imposing fees on plans sold on the marketplaces. Others are spreading costs more widely \u2014 which, in one instance, has drawn a federal lawsuit.\n\nRhode Island received high marks for the smooth rollout of HealthSource RI amid last year\u2019s stumbles by the federal government, and the agency director says the state\u2019s health care reform \u201crevolution\u201d has begun. But the state does not have a way to pay for the exchange\u2019s long-term operations, and some lawmakers in the state General Assembly have suggested shifting to the federal exchange.\n\nThe cost to operate Rhode Island\u2019s exchange is estimated at $17 million a year, although an earlier estimate pegged the cost at $24 million. Republican state Rep. Patricia Morgan introduced a bill last session to transfer its operations to the federal government, but the legislation was held for further study.\n\n\u201cThink of what we can do with $24 million,\u201d she said.\n\nSome states have decided to tap existing revenue.\n\nNew York is relying on two agencies\u2019 general revenue, while Maryland is using money from an existing 2 percent tax on insurance plans. Republican Delegate Anthony O\u2019Donnell, a critic of Maryland\u2019s decision to create its own exchange, said he continues to question its sustainability. He said last week that he is concerned \u201cabout the entire structure and that it may collapse of its own weight.\u201d\n\nTo cut costs, Colorado\u2019s state-run exchange has reduced overall spending 18 percent, including on technology and marketing. It\u2019s imposing a 1.4 percent fee on monthly premiums for its plans but also approved charging a $1.25-a-month \u201cgeneral market\u201d fee on all individual and small group policies, including those sold outside the state exchange.\n\nSome lawmakers called the fee unfair, and one board member voted against it. It is expected to raise an estimated $13 million a year before it expires in 2016.\n\nIn the District of Columbia, which also is operating its own marketplace, the exchange\u2019s budget is being funded by a new 1 percent tax on all health insurance policies. The American Council of Life Insurers is suing, arguing it unfairly taxes insurance products that cannot be purchased on the exchange.\n\nTaxing only plans offered on the exchange would have required a 17 percent tax to cover costs, officials said, reducing the benefit to low-income residents.\n\nEarlier this year, California\u2019s exchange said it was setting aside $184 million in federal money to fight off projected budget shortfalls through 2016. About 1.1 million people enrolled in the first year, exceeding projections, and officials hope to grow that to 1.7 million during the second round of open enrollment.\n\nOfficials with Covered California, as the exchange is known, express confidence about its financial health. The agency\u2019s board has projected a $250 million reserve for the coming year, built partly from a $13.95 monthly surcharge on individual policies.\n\n\u201cWe do not have a deficit; our enrollment is sufficient to fund ongoing operations through 2015-16,\u201d Covered California spokesman James Scullary said. \u201cWe remain committed to managing our resources prudently.\u201d\n\nThe Vermont marketplace, which is being funded by the state\u2019s health care provider tax, is on shakier ground. Officials there acknowledged it could face a $20 million shortfall by year\u2019s end. The state hopes pending federal grants will fill the gap.\n\nIn Rhode Island, HealthSource\u2019s individual market enrollment of more than 26,000 heading into the second sign-up period exceeded unofficial federal projections. Officials plan to continue using federal money through 2015. Beyond that, the funding mechanism is unclear.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s time, but there\u2019s not that much time, so these decisions need to be made,\u201d exchange Director Christine Ferguson said during a recent briefing.\n\nShe has called abandoning HealthSource short-sighted and warned that doing so could come with its own costs.\n\nDemocratic Gov.-elect Gina Raimondo wants to keep HealthSource local and has pledged to scrutinize its budget and get \u201ccreative.\u201d But the top House Democrat, Nicholas Mattiello, remains skeptical about its cost and value.\n\n\u201cAt this point, Speaker Mattiello isn\u2019t satisfied that the exchange has made its case,\u201d spokesman Larry Berman said.\n\n__\n\nAssociated Press writers David Gram in Montpelier, Vermont; Judy Lin in Sacramento, California; Ben Nuckols in Washington, D.C.; Michael Virtanen in Albany, New York; Brian Witte in Annapolis, Maryland; and Kristen Wyatt in Denver contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "gplus-count": 4, "twitter": {"description": "PROVIDENCE, R.I.\u00a0(AP) \u2014 The federal government shelled out billions of dollars to get health insurance marketplaces going in the 14 states that opted to run their own.
