Some said the gaffe may have even cost him the election. Although Ford initially doubled down on the misstatement, he eventually tried to correct himself on the campaign trail, and in his memoir chastised himself for not acknowledging earlier what he described as the \u201cworst mistake I ever made politically.\u201d\n\nThe point is that neither Ford nor his party tried to deny he had made a blunder, or insist that he had somehow been misunderstood. That would have been crazy.\n\nWhile gaffes and misstatements may be inevitable with all the televised blabbing presidential candidates do these days, it seems the concept of the gaffe\u2014the flub\u2014has all but disappeared, along with humility, self-reflection and the concept of apologizing. But no matter how rigorously they are denied, the gaffes are flying in this year\u2019s race, and the Republicans, despite their very best efforts, have not fully cornered the market on them.\n\nHere are some of the top campaign trail gaffes this year, most of them performed in front of a national audience of debate watchers.\n\n1. Christie is lying down with a dead Arab king, or propping him up to stand with him, or something.\n\nNew Jersey governor Chris Christie is running on his robustness and toughness. He alone has the energy and fortitude to prosecute terrorists and keep orphan refugees and dangerous Ebola nurses out of his state. So he\u2019s the very opposite of being dead (unlike, say Ben Carson).\n\nSo it was a little bit of a headscratcher when the governator forcefully stated he would stand with King Hussein of Jordan against all the terrible things in the world, like Obama\u2019s nuclear deal with Iran.\n\nUnlikely.\n\nApparently, this tough guy has a time machine at his disposal because King Hussein is very dead. Has been inconveniently so since 1999. King Abdullah II took his place, and in fact, Christie and his family were guests of King Abdullah in 2012.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t the worst thing Christie said in a performance full of hysteria-mongering, and it might not even have been the dumbest. That distinction probably goes to his assertion that he would shoot down a Russian plane. But it was the gaffiest.\n\nOn the other hand, the guy did at least acknowledge that he misspoke.\n\n2. Carly Fiorina salutes her generals. They say you\u2019re wrong, Carly. She says shut up and sit down.\n\nIf Carly Fiorina bore any resemblance to a sentient human being, she would have just acknowledged she made a mistake when she claimed that generals \u201cPetraeus, McChrystal, Mattis, Keane, Flynn \u2026 retired early because they told President Obama things that he didn\u2019t want to hear,\u201d during the last Republican debate.\n\nEven mainstream news organizations tried to point out that she was mistaken, and it\u2019s fairly easy to find out what really happened. Keane retired in 2003, well before Obama took office. Petraeus was promoted by Obama to head the CIA and then forced to resign because of improprieties surrounding an extramarital affair.\n\nBut pointing out her error did not seem to make a dent in Fiorina\u2019s ironclad insistence that facts be damned, she was sticking to her guns. Someone might have been cringing somewhere, but it wasn\u2019t Carly.\n\nWhich raises the question, if a gaffe falls in front of a national television audience and doesn\u2019t cause a cringe, is it still a gaffe?\n\n3. Trump and those cheering Muslims in New Jersey.\n\nTrump, as we all know, has made an uncountable number of outrageous statements on the campaign trail, from blatant dog-whistles about Muslims and Mexicans and crude misogyny about Fiorina\u2019s face, Clinton\u2019s bathroom habits and Megyn Kelly\u2019s menstrual cycles, to mimicking a physically disabled man and criticizing a war veteran for having been taken prisoner.\n\nAnd he\u2019s said remarkably stupid things, like the nonsensical gibberish he spewed at the last debate about the nuclear arsenal that would terrifyingly be under his thumb if he were elected. This incoherent string of disconnected words would, to any normal person, have been extremely embarrassing. \u201cI think, for me, nuclear is just the power, the devastation is very important to me,\u201d he managed to say.\n\nBut since Trump is hardly alone in tossing his word salads (Jeb! we\u2019re looking at you), we\u2019ll nominate his assertion that he watched \u201cthousands of Muslims cheering in New Jersey\u201d after 9/11 another demonstrably untrue statement that even the mainstream media called him out on.\n\nNormal people, upon having it pointed out that they are seeing things that simply are not there, would feel a certain amount of sheepishness. Yepp, that\u2019s what normally happens, in a normal world, which is not apparently the one in which the campaign is being waged.\n\n4. Hillary\u2019s absurd explanation of her coziness with Wall Street.\n\nIn the Democratic debate immediately following the Paris attacks, Hillary got the chance to show off some of her foreign policy cred. But to her consternation, Bernie Sanders asked her to defend her historically cozy relationship with big money and Wall Street and explain how she can be independent when they give her such big donations. Bizarrely, she decided to cast that relationship in terms of 9/11. Her reasoning, because 9/11 occurred in the Wall Street area and she was the senator from New York at the time, she worked hard with the financial sector to help them recover.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Slip-ups on the campaign trail are inevitable, but seldom are they this bizarre.
