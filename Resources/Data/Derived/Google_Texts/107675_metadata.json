About 85% of 2015 enrollees are getting assistance to buy coverage on the marketplaces.\n\nHow long that assistance will remain available is unclear, however. The Supreme Court is expected to rule this month in a challenge that claims the law prohibits these subsidies in states that are not operating their own insurance marketplaces through the health law.\n\nThe health law allows Americans who don't get health benefits at work to shop among plans on state-based marketplaces operated by the federal government or by the states themselves, including California, Connecticut and Maryland.\n\nConsumers making less than 4 times the federal poverty level \u2013 or about $97,000 for a family of four \u2013 qualify for subsidies.\n\nInsurers must provide a basic set of benefits and cannot turn away consumers, even if they are sick.\n\nSustained growth in enrollment is considered key to reducing the number of uninsured and keeping premiums in check by getting healthier Americans into the market, key goals of the law.\n\n\u201cThe health insurance marketplaces are working,\u201d Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia M. Burwell said Tuesday.\n\nMultiple surveys over the last year have recorded historic declines in the number of uninsured since the law\u2019s major coverage expansion began in 2014. Rand Corp., a Santa Monica nonprofit research firm, last month reported that the number of Americans without coverage declined by nearly 17 million.\n\nBut the coverage gains are jeopardized by the legal challenge before the Supreme Court, which may affect as many as 7.5 million consumers in 37 states.\n\nThere is also growing evidence that uncertainty over the case may also be pushing up insurance premiums, as insurers prepare for major disruptions that would be caused by the elimination of subsidies.\n\n@noamlevey", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Latest Obamacare enrollment total slips but still outpaces 2014", "Description": "Nationwide enrollment in health plans provided through the Affordable Care Act slipped to 10.2 million in March as consumers dropped coverage or failed to pay premiums on policies they selected, the Obama administration announced Tuesday.
