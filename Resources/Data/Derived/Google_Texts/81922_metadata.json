Paul Broun (R-Ga.) would be a #1 seed. The right-wing Georgian might even be favored to win the whole competition.\n\nPutting together a list of Broun\u2019s greatest hits is difficult \u2013 my personal favorite was when the congressman, a member of the House Science Committee, said cosmology, biology, and geology are quite literally \u201c lies straight from the pit of Hell \u201d \u2013 and Right Wing Watch\u2019s collection of Broun stories is several pages long.\n\nSo perhaps it\u2019s not too surprising that Broun, now a leading U.S. Senate candidate, hired a rhetoric coach , though it does seem odd that he\u2019s used our money to do so.\n\nGOP Rep. Paul Broun, a Tea Party favorite and the current front-runner to win the GOP nomination for his state\u2019s upcoming Senate election, is scrambling to explain why between 2012 and 2014 his office spent more than $30,000 of taxpayer money on a debate coach\u2026. His main explanation so far? Silence and a firmly slammed door. After Channel 2 Action News reporter Justin Gray, who went through Broun\u2019s office\u2019s financial records and discovered the payments to Brett O\u2019Donnell, whom the Raw Story describes as \u201ca former debate coach from Jerry Falwell\u2019s Liberty University who worked on Michele Bachmann\u2019s 2012 presidential campaign, as well as stints with former President George W. Bush and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney,\u201d Gray attempted to get an on-camera response from Broun. But Broun wasn\u2019t in the mood, choosing instead to escape to his office.\n\nPerhaps the coach never got around to prepping the congressman on how to deal with a journalist asking an awkward question?\n\nAfter Broun fled from the local reporter, his office issued a statement explaining that the congressman did use taxpayer money to pay a former debate coach, but the funds were used so \u201cBroun can best communicate his legislative priorities, issues, and message with his constituents.\u201d\n\nStepping back, there are a couple of angles to keep in mind. First, as Ed Kilgore noted , if Broun paid Brett O\u2019Donnell to help with Broun\u2019s Senate candidacy, that\u2019s a problem \u2013 campaign aides are supposed to be paid with campaign funds, not tax dollars.\n\nSecond, it\u2019s hard not to wonder whether Broun is a good student when it comes to accepting guidance from his rhetoric coach. After all, if O\u2019Donnell joined the congressman\u2019s team in 2012, we might expect to see an improvement in Broun\u2019s public remarks since then, but we haven\u2019t. He seems every bit as unhinged now as he did in 2011.\n\nTo be sure, it\u2019s understandable that the Georgia Republican would get some communications suggestions. It wasn\u2019t too long ago that Broun insisted that President Obama only believes in supporting \u201c the Soviet constitution .\u201d The congressman, an apparent Birther , has also said cap-and-trade might kill people ; the Affordable Care Act will dictate what kind of car Americans can drive ; the health care law reminds him of \u201c Northern Aggression \u201d; and he considers the president a Hitler-like figure intent on establishing a Gestapo-like security force to impose a Marxist dictatorship on Americans.\n\nI n 2010, Broun even argued that the Centers for Disease Control might \u201cgive all the power to the federal government to force you\u201d to eat healthier foods, which would include the CDC \u201ccalling you to make sure you eat fruits and vegetables, every day.
