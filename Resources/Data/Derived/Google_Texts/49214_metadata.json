Rand Paul, R-Ky., speaking in Exeter on Saturday, has called on former secretary of state Hillary Clinton to return donations to the Clinton Foundation from Saudi Arabia and other countries that have poor records of human rights. (DAN TUOHY/New Hampshire Union Leader) U.S. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., speaking in Exeter on Saturday, has called on former secretary of state Hillary Clinton to return donations to the Clinton Foundation from Saudi Arabia and other countries that have poor records of human rights. (DAN TUOHY/New Hampshire Union Leader)\n\nPaul calls out Clinton on women's rights\n\n\n\nEXETER - Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul is demanding Hillary Clinton return Clinton Foundation donations from Saudi Arabia and other foreign countries with poor human rights records.\n\n\n\nThe likely Republican presidential hopeful lit into the likely Democratic candidate in an interview Saturday.\n\n\n\n\"I think she needs to return the money to the country she took it from,\" Paul said. \"I think it sends a very bad statement to the world and to the American public that she's willing to take money from countries that have such really poor human rights and women's rights records.\"\n\n\n\nPaul cited Saudi Arabia and Brunei, a country in Southeast Asia, where he said a woman accused of adultery risks death by stoning.\n\n\n\n\"In Saudi Arabia, a woman was gang-raped by seven men and the woman was then, when she went to the police, arrested and given 90 lashes - the victim of a rape,\" Paul said. \"I think it's unconscionable that Hillary Clinton would accept money from a country that treats women that way.\"\n\n\n\nPaul is on a two-day visit to New Hampshire as he explores a run for President. An announcement is anticipated in early April.\n\n\n\nPhil Nazzaro, a 2014 state Senate GOP nominee from Newmarket, hosted a breakfast gathering for Paul at Epoch Restaurant in Exeter on Saturday. Paul began the day greeting people at the Pink Cadillac Diner in Rochester. His schedule included stops in Hampstead and Hollis, where he was to appear with state Sens. Regina Birdsell, R-Hampstead, and Sen. Kevin Avard, R-Nashua.\n\n\n\nNazzaro was on the veterans committee for Ron Paul in 2012. He is not endorsing anyone at this point, but he spoke highly of the buzz around Rand Paul.\n\n\n\n\"He has a message that appeals to a broad group,\" Nazzaro said.\n\n\n\nIn Exeter, Paul said Congress must take bigger steps to curb federal largess and get real with the debt, which puts America \"closer to the day of reckoning.\"\n\n\n\nPaul received applause when he said the Affordable Care Act should be repealed. He was critical of Medicaid expansion, in his home state and in the Granite State. \"The problem is, money doesn't grow on trees,\" he said.\n\n\n\nPaul called for abolishing the U.S. Department of Education as one step to trim the federal government.\n\n\n\nAn audience member asked him about why he joined 46 U.S. senators, including Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H., in signing a letter to Iran regarding negotiations on nuclear weapons.\n\n\n\nCongress will only negotiate a good deal, Paul replied. Moreover, he said, the letter gives the U.S. leverage to negotiate from a position of strength.\"\n\n\n\n\"I think also it's the constitutional position,\" Paul said in a follow-up interview. \"The Constitution says that legislation is written by Congress and legislation can only be undone by Congress. Most of the sanctions against Iran are laws that are passed by Congress. So (President Obama) doesn't really have the legal ability to undo them. He has to ask permission.\"\n\n\n\nPaul said he is still looking at the Republican budget proposals released this past week, but he said Republicans need to show the American people that they are serious about fixing the debt and deficit.\n\n\n\nThe debt left behind after this administration will be a huge burden on the middle class, and those least able to make ends meet, said Paul.\n\n\n\nObama has trashed the Republicans' budget as a blueprint to benefit the rich over the middle class. \"Sounds like pablum to me,\" Paul said of the President's response.\n\n\n\ndtuohy@unionleader.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo improve the chance of seeing your comment posted here or published in the New Hampshire Union Leader:\n\n\n\nIdentify yourself.
