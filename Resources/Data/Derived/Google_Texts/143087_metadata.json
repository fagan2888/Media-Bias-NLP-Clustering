COSTELLO/STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER)Buy Photo\n\nMarlboro has received an $825,000 Green Acres matching grant that will go mostly toward new purchases.\n\nMayor Jonathan Hornik said the grant is the largest Marlboro has so far gotten.\n\nThe township\u2019s portion of the matching grant will come from its Open Space Trust Fund. Taxpayers are taxed a penny for every $100 of assessed property value to fund open space acquisition.\n\nIn 2014, Marlboro protected 87 new acres of open space with the Smith Farm, Penska Farm and Baydock Holdings parcels, and preserved the 29-acre Baymar property on Harbor Road as a farm, Hormik said.\n\nTownship officials said the new grant will pay off the remainder of the Baydock acquisition but is largely for new, unspecified purchases.\n\nThe township\u2019s matching grant was one of a dozen projects in Monmouth County being approved for either Green Acre grants or loans through the Garden State Preservation Trust Fund in mid June. They included a $1.1 million Green Acres grant that would help Asbury Park preserve a half-acre property on North Beach that is slated for a townhouse project.\n\nAnother eight projects in Ocean County, including the acquisition of a marina in Seaside Heights, were also part of the $102.3 million statewide approval.\n\nKen Serrano: 732-643-4029; kserrano@gannettnj.com\n\nDon't miss a thing Download our apps and get alerts for local news, weather, traffic and more.
