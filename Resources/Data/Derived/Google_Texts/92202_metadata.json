The law has increased insurance coverage overall by providing tax-subsized private health insurance to middle- and low-income Americans, and allows the lowest-income people to receive government-funded care under Medicaid. It also treats mental health care as more equal to other medical care.\n\nWith greater health care coverage, people are expected to more easily and regularly access medical services, but the CDC analysis suggests that may not be happening. In the past, research has shown that adults with mental health conditions have greater health care needs and are at a higher risk for poor health outcomes. They also historically have more difficulty accessing care.\n\nThe latest data come from the National Health Interview Survey \u2013 which is based on information collected by the U.S. Census Bureau through personal household interviews \u2013 and offer health care-related estimates from 2012 through the first nine months of 2015, during which around 15 million people at least gained health insurance. Today, that number is closer to 20 million.\n\nThe analysis focuses on adults between the ages of 18 to 64 with \"serious psychological distress,\" meaning those whose mental health conditions are serious enough to get in the way of their work, schooling or social life.\n\nIts findings show that the percentage of those with mental health issues who lacked insurance coverage decreased by 8.6 percentage points between 2012 and 2015, though each year this group was still more likely to be uninsured than those without such problems.\n\nPercentage of adults aged 18 to 64 with and without serious psychological distress during the past 30 days who were uninsured at the time of interview.

Still, private coverage increased by 8.1 percentage points within this group.\n\nThe percentage of people with public coverage who had mental health conditions remained relatively stable over this time period. (Courtesy CDC/NCHS)\n\nYet despite the increase in insurance coverage, the analysis shows that the percentage of people who had a regular place to go for care remained relatively stable.\n\nThere was no significant change in the percentage of people who had a usual place to go for medical care, authors of the study noted. (Courtesy CDC/NCHS)\n\nThe same trend was observed for those who had seen a doctor or other health care professional during the past 12 months.\n\nThe percentage of people who had seen or talked to any health care professional in the past 12 months remained relatively stable.

The report does not delve into whether they didn't see a professional because they didn't need to, or because they were unable to when they tried.\n\nThe authors do note, however, that the trend may be due to more primary care doctors offering mental health services, or to a shortage of mental health providers.\n\nEven though insurance coverage increased, the data show that a smaller percentage of people with serious psychological distress had seen a mental health specialist in the past year. (Courtesy CDC/NCHS)\n\nThe study also included data about the cost of care. As insurance coverage increased, cost became less of a barrier to getting medical care, though it was still more likely to be one among those who had mental health conditions versus those who did not.\n\nEven with expanded medical coverage, 24.4 percent of adults with serious psychological distress didn't get care because of cost. (Courtesy CDC/NCHS)\n\nThe same trend was observed for prescription medications. Though a lower percentage of people with mental health conditions reported they were unable to afford medications in 2015 than in previous years, they were still five times more likely to face this barrier than people without mental health conditions.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "health care reform", "title": "Here's What Obamacare Did for Mental Health", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "People gained insurance coverage under the health care law, but access barriers remain.", "title": "Here's What Obamacare Did for Mental Health", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2016-05-04/heres-what-obamacare-did-for-mental-health", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/dd/85/a84a8f5b4b668cf151eebad43862/140428-mental-stock.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@USNews", "description": "People gained insurance coverage under the health care law, but access barriers remain.", "card": "summary", "title": "Here's What Obamacare Did for Mental Health"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "news", "date_published": "May 4, 2016", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Kimberly Leonard,mental health,psychology,psychiatry,Data Mine [News],Pulse,picks,Affordable Care Act,health care reform", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "People gained insurance coverage under the health care law, but access barriers remain."}, "article_summary": "In the past, research has shown that adults with mental health conditions have greater health care needs and are at a higher risk for poor health outcomes.\n(Courtesy CDC/NCHS)But the percentage of those who saw a mental health professional decreased among those who had mental health needs.\nThe authors do note, however, that the trend may be due to more primary care doctors offering mental health services, or to a shortage of mental health providers.\nThough a lower percentage of people with mental health conditions reported they were unable to afford medications in 2015 than in previous years, they were still five times more likely to face this barrier than people without mental health conditions.\n(Courtesy CDC/NCHS)People with mental health issues also were more likely to have public insurance coverage like Medicaid, rather than private health insurance."}
