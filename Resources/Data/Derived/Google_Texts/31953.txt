President Obama came into the White House promising to unite the country. He promised to unite Americans past political parties, beyond racial divides, through age gaps, and now-former senior advisor Dan Pfeiffer stood at his side through all of the promises.

But Pfeiffer, who stepped down from his post on Friday, admitted in an “exit interview” with New York Magazine that the White House gave up on that idea long ago.

He told NY Mag that Republicans were unreachable and that the polarizing situation in Washington –which has only gotten worse since Obama took office — will likely continue at least until current millennials start taking over as political leaders.

Until then, Pfeiffer said, it’s basically just a waiting game. Well, he said that and then threw a lot more blame at Republicans, naturally.
