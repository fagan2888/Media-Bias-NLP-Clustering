To minimize that, some companies are saying the W-2 should be used. The compact, one-page W-2 form already reports basic data on employees such as wages, federal income tax, Social Security tax and Medicare wage tax withheld.\n\nEmployees get the W-2 from their employer each year no later than January 31 and file it with the forms they use to pay taxes.\n\n\"There is a view among employers that if they could get it on the W-2 in a simple manner that this would actually aid tax reporting,\" said Seth Perretta, a tax lawyer with Crowell & Moring, representing the American Benefits Council, a corporate lobbying group focused on employee benefits, at the hearing.\n\nBusinesses want to use the W-2 to tell the IRS, for instance, when an employee was offered healthcare coverage during the year, or any changes in healthcare coverage for employees' children, he said.\n\nThe IRS hearing was held to get feedback about the agency's proposed Affordable Care Act reporting rules for businesses.\n\nIn July, the Obama administration delayed until 2015 the ACA healthcare reporting requirements and penalties for businesses. Tackney and other IRS officials declined to say when they will finalize the business reporting rules.\n\nThe IRS already caused confusion for individuals when it changed the W-2 form for healthcare reporting requirements in 2012, said Jeffrey Porter, who heads the tax division of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountant.\n\nHe said on Monday that an even a longer W-2 \"is going to confuse the average taxpayer.\"\n\n(Editing by Kevin Drawbaugh and Leslie Adler)", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Patrick Temple-West", "Author": "Patrick Temple-West", "DCSext.PageNumber": 1, "twitter": {"description": "West", "title": "Adding Obamacare data to W-2 tax form may confuse: IRS", "image": {"src": "http://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}, "creator": "@Reuters", "site": "@Reuters", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "DCSext.rChannel": "Article -
