In addition to a lot of troubling ideas of what it means to be \u201cNegro,\u201d dozens of white students show up in blackface and wigs. The film opens up with the news that this party has occurred, and then dials back the clock five weeks to watch how it all went down the way it did. When the party finally happens (again), in the final act of the film, Simien\u2019s script and his actors have relayed so much emotional complexity around the subject of race on campus that seeing white students in blackface is a literally painful experience (if it wasn\u2019t already). And that\u2019s how Simien makes his point \u2014 by letting the audience feel it fully, themselves. The film is extraordinarily unbiased, except toward compassion for its characters; even the instigators of the party have their moments of trying to be understood.\n\nReality television is a concern of Simien\u2019s in his film, too, personified in Colandrea Conners, who shortens her name to \u201cCoco\u201d to sound less \u201chood.\u201d One of the first scenes of \u201cDear White People\u201d is Coco auditioning for a reality TV show filming on campus and being turned down for not being interesting enough. It\u2019s heavily implied that if she were to be more provocatively \u201cblack\u201d \u2014 whatever that means \u2014 she\u2019d be more likely to get \u201cnoticed\u201d \u2014 whatever that means. It\u2019s Coco\u2019s first step on a journey that becomes about learning to massage your identity to best advantage, even as she is one of the black students uninterested in activism on campus, what she terms \u201cblaming\u201d white people for their problems, and even dating black men. As portrayed by the wonderful Teyonah Parris (who plays the part of Dawn on \u201cMad Men\u201d) Coco\u2019s story is a tragic little sideshow that contains a lot of the pain and uncomfortable truths of \u201cDear White People.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s this particular dynamic that Simien discusses in the Vulture excerpt. Like the tone of \u201cDear White People\u201d itself, Simien is tongue-in-cheek and self-indicting. \u201cStereotypes from the slack-jawed, no-good black male to the sexually promiscuous, foul-mouthed black woman are so ubiquitous, groups of people in the country assume that this is how all black people really behave. Now the confused, shuffling Mammies and flamboyant, vapid Zip Coons of yesteryear are actually real people, competing for Donald Trump\u2019s affection and/or that of each other\u2019s man.\u201d He specifically calls out \u201cReal Housewives of Atlanta\u201d breakout star Nene Leakes (whose shortened name sounds a lot like his character Coco\u2019s) and former \u201cApprentice\u201d contestant Omarosa for having a type of notoriety among audiences that undercuts black racial identity, arguing that they \u201cvalidat[e] the worst stereotypes of black folks for people whose contact with actual black people is limited. And boy, are they fun!\u201d\n\nWhere the bulk of \u201cDear White People\u201d is about processing the reality of white people appropriating blackness, this essay, and the film subplot around Coco, are about something a lot more complicated: the complicity of black people in the perception of blackness. And though that is something I have no personal experience with, I happen to have watched a lot of reality television. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m entirely on board with Simien\u2019s interpretation of reality TV as the new blackface, especially when the old blackface seems to be still alive and kicking. But I do see that blackness has become a commodity that people of all races use to survive, whether that\u2019s by exploiting it or appropriating it or performing it. And the biggest space for that on television is in reality television.\n\nThat fact \u2014 that racial tensions and identities are so on display in the world of unscripted programming \u2014 is in reality television\u2019s favor; it might be a tense space, but it\u2019s the most diverse subgenre of television out there. Simien\u2019s point in critiquing racial representation on reality TV is that these groups aren\u2019t well represented anywhere else \u2014 \u201cThe Olivia Pope character on \u2018Scandal\u2019 simply cannot wash away the impressions of all the shucking and jiving happening between black people on reality TV.\u201d But at the same time, reality television contains multitudes, and Simien himself confesses to watching a great deal of it. A show like \u201cSay Yes to the Dress\u201d has a very different relationship to its black \u201ccharacters\u201d than a show like \u201cReal Housewives of Atlanta\u201d \u2014 largely because those two shows cast very differently. (The former is looking for a memorable personality; the latter is looking for an interesting family situation that could end with some kind of heartwarming flourish.) Add in shows like \u201cBlack Ink\u201d on VH1 or \u201cRuPaul\u2019s Drag Race\u201d on Logo and this idea of what it means for black people to be overrepresented on reality television becomes very difficult to pinpoint; it means many different things.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"Dear White People\" creator Justin Simien called reality TV \"blackface.\" But it's actually much more complicated", "author": "Sonia Saraiya", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "\"Dear White People\" creator Justin Simien called reality TV \"blackface.\" But it's actually much more complicated", "title": "Reality TV is not the \u201cnew blackface\u201d: How reality shows became some of our most useful explorations of race in America", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/11/16/reality_tv_is_not_the_new_blackface_how_reality_shows_became_some_of_our_most_useful_explorations_of_race_in_america/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/11/prison_wives_club.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"Dear White People\" creator Justin Simien called reality TV \"blackface.\" But it's actually much more complicated", "creator": "@soniasaraiya", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/11/prison_wives_club.jpg", "title": "Reality TV is not the \u201cnew blackface\u201d: How reality shows became some of our most useful explorations of race in America", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Reality TV is not the \u201cnew blackface\u201d: How reality shows became some of our most useful explorations of race in America", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, blackface, dear white people, Editor's Picks, Girlfriend Intervention, justin simien, minstrelsy, prison wives club, Reality TV", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf411\"", "article_summary": "And the biggest space for that on television is in reality television.\nAnd though that is something I have no personal experience with, I happen to have watched a lot of reality television.\nI\u2019m not sure I\u2019m entirely on board with Simien\u2019s interpretation of reality TV as the new blackface, especially when the old blackface seems to be still alive and kicking.\nLike the tone of \u201cDear White People\u201d itself, Simien is tongue-in-cheek and self-indicting.\nAdd in shows like \u201cBlack Ink\u201d on VH1 or \u201cRuPaul\u2019s Drag Race\u201d on Logo and this idea of what it means for black people to be overrepresented on reality television becomes very difficult to pinpoint; it means many different things."}
