But in the world of health care, he\u2019s considered a visionary. He\u2019s served as medical director for the state\u2019s Medicaid program under former Governor Michael Dukakis. But he soon may be known nationwide as the man who revolutionized primary care.\n\nIn 2004, Master founded Commonwealth Care Alliance. It\u2019s an unusual group that focuses on Massachusetts residents who are eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid. In other words, the neediest, most medically complicated, and most expensive patients in the state. They usually have multiple chronic conditions that mean frequent visits to hospital emergency rooms or intensive care units.\n\nCommonwealth Care has re-imagined primary care for these patients. They get access to doctors 24/7, home visits and an entire, interdisciplinary team of doctors, social workers, mental health experts, etc. to ensure that every aspect of the patient\u2019s life is improved. The results are remarkable. Master\u2019s patients are healthier. They don\u2019t visit the hospital as often, which means in some cases, the cost to treat them has dropped by more than 50 percent.\n\nThe health care world has taken notice. Tucked inside the Affordable Care Act are dozens of pilot programs that are testing new ideas in medicine. Bob Master\u2019s Commonwealth Care is now part of a Massachusetts pilot program called MassHealth OneCare. For the next three years, OneCare plans enroll 100,000 Massachusetts residents \u2014 to see if Master\u2019s revolutionary integrated care system can work at larger scale. If it does, in 2015, the Affordable Care Act will expand the program to 20 other states\u2026 in effect, transforming primary care for many of the most expensive, most vulnerable patients in America.\n\nAs a boy, it was his job to take his uninsured, immigrant grandfather to a large Boston hospital for cancer treatment.\n\nGuest\n\nDr. Robert Master, Chief Executive Officer of Commonwealth Care Alliance\n\nMore\n\nWBUR\u2019s Commonhealth As CEO of this unorthdox hybrid \u2014 part health care provider, part HMO, part payer \u2014 Dr. Bob Master must take on multiple roles.\n\nWBUR\u2019s Commonhealth One of the most radical elements of Commonwealth Care is that patients can get a huge amount of medical attention when they need it.\n\nHealth Affairs In terms of quality of care, in 2009 Commonwealth Care Alliance scored in the ninetieth percentile or above on Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set measures for comprehensive diabetes care, monitoring for patients on long-term medication, and access to preventive services.\n\nOther stories from this show:", "article_metadata": {"description": "Tucked inside the Affordable Care Act are dozens of pilot programs that are testing new ideas in medicine, including one to treat the neediest, most medically complicated and most expensive patients in Massachusetts.", "og": {"site_name": "radioboston", "description": "Tucked inside the Affordable Care Act are dozens of pilot programs that are testing new ideas in medicine, including one to treat the neediest, most medically complicated and most expensive patients in Massachusetts.", "title": "Pilot To Try To Treat Sickest, Most Expensive Patients", "url": "http://radioboston.wbur.org/2013/11/11/robert-master-one-care", "image": "http://s3.amazonaws.com/media.wbur.org/wordpress/9/files/2013/11/Hospital_room_ubt-624x468.jpeg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://radioboston.wbur.org/2013/11/11/robert-master-one-care", "image": "//s3.amazonaws.com/media.wbur.org/wordpress/9/files/2013/11/Hospital_room_ubt-624x468.jpeg", "site": "@RadioBoston", "card": "summary", "title": "Pilot To Try To Treat Sickest, Most Expensive Patients"}, "DC.date.issued": "2013-11-11", "msvalidate.01": "D02D46BAEDB3F81FC1B1DE2A8CB69551", "fb": {"admins": 1549080028, "app_id": 134067973330252}, "keywords": "radioboston wbur boston metro local news"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcee81\"", "article_summary": "Commonwealth Care has re-imagined primary care for these patients.\nBut he soon may be known nationwide as the man who revolutionized primary care.\nBob Master\u2019s Commonwealth Care is now part of a Massachusetts pilot program called MassHealth OneCare.\nMaster\u2019s patients are healthier.\nWBUR\u2019s Commonhealth One of the most radical elements of Commonwealth Care is that patients can get a huge amount of medical attention when they need it."}
