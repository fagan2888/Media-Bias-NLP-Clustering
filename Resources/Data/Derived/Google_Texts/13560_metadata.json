Anderson\n\nStars: Kit Harington, Emily Browning\n\nRating: PG-13\n\n2 (out of 5) Globes\n\nYou may not think a filmmaker whose filmography is half video game adaptations would have a serious critical fanbase. But such acclaim has fallen upon junk auteur Paul W.S. Anderson. It's not undeserved. At his best (his three \u201cResident Evil\u201d entries), he's a clean, visual stylist worthy of study. At his worst (\u201cAlien vs. Predator,\u201d the noisy, clangy \u201cDeath Race\u201d remake), he\u2019s a hack, deserving of nothing. Either way, he\u2019s a brand of filmmaker that\u2019s been with us since cinema's start: the workhorse whose craft is loved by the masses (sometimes), but ignored, even mocked, by all but a batch of the cognoscenti.\n\nIndeed, if he had been around in the 1950s, Anderson might have cranked out something like \u201cPompeii,\u201d a swords-and-sandals throwback with few aspirations than to throw out a few thrilling fight scenes then destroy its titular town-city with an erupting volcano. Releasing in the era, it would have been a low-rent rip-off of the lumbering Roman epics of the period, one that cuts to the chase to give you the goods.\n\nOf course, \u201cPompeii\u201d is a $100 million behemoth, fitted with 3-D that makes the carnage that much more questionably thrilling. But at heart it's a B-movie. Part \u201cGladiator,\u201d part \u201cTitanic,\u201d it centers on a Celtic badass with the very non-badass name of Milo (Kit Harington, of \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d). Captured and dragged to the doomed locale, he attracts the illicit stares of Cassia (Emily Browning), who finds his manliness much more hotcha than the preening overtures of a corrupt Senator (Kiefer Sutherland, doing a very good Billy Zane).\n\nLittle of this matters, of course, because everyone's going to die. That the filmmakers are as unforgiving and indiscriminate as Mount Vesuvius itself is marginally interesting \u2014 marginally. Truth is, \"Pompeii\" is a passably anonymous gladiator programmer that gets interrupted by a so-so apocalypse. On one level, it's admirable that Anderson takes no joy in the hellish wiping out of decent and hissable alike, in burning up or drowning innocent women and children. He does take glee when various baddies eat it, but that\u2019s to be expected.\n\nOn the other level, \"Pompeii\" needs more vulgarity. The script is too basic, even for Anderson, and the decimation, when it comes, just doesn't give him enough to do visually. The palette gets stained black and gray with smoke and ash, punctuated only by the orange of spat fireballs. But Anderson is someone who excels at screen movement; think the delightful zig-zagging through frames \u2014 in 3-D, no less \u2014 in \"Resident Evil: Afterlife.\" The running and fleeing and occasional fighting \u2014 when they should be trying to reach higher ground \u2014 through the murk of an erupting volcano only proves monotonous. You've seen one felled building or ship, you've seen them all.\n\nPredictably, Anderson can't do anything with the star-crossed romance aspect. He has no feel for characters as people \u2014 to him, they're just bodies to move about and occasionally kick butt. He needs heroes with personality and swagger, like his wife and frequent star Milla Jovovich. He gets Harington, who is granite rock \u2014 good with a sword, okay with a badass bellow, listless at anything else. (There's some decent back-up in fellow fighter Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, who snarls like few have ever snarled.) Even shameless junk needs some meat on it. This is bare-boned.\n\nFollow Matt Prigge on Twitter @mattprigge", "article_metadata": {"description": "Review: 'Pompeii' doesn't give a junk auteur enough to do", "author": "Matt Prigge", "og": {"site_name": "Metro", "description": "Review: 'Pompeii' doesn't give a junk auteur enough to do", "title": "Review: \"Pompeii\" Doesn't Give a Junk Auteur Enough to Do", "url": "http://www.metro.us/entertainment/review-pompeii-doesn-t-give-a-junk-auteur-enough-to-do/tmWnbt---95eHmjLqE5aYE/", "image": "http://www.metro.us/_internal/gxml!0/4dntvuhh2yeo4npyb3igdet73odaolf$mn9zmot7haor68v3q2qornws5iwi624/WEK_Pompeii_02211-614x408.jpeg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "metro.us", "description": "Review: 'Pompeii' doesn't give a junk auteur enough to do", "creator": "Matt Prigge", "image": {"src": "http://www.metro.us/_internal/gxml!0/4dntvuhh2yeo4npyb3igdet73odaolf$mn9zmot7haor68v3q2qornws5iwi624/WEK_Pompeii_02211-614x408.jpeg"}, "title": "Review: \"Pompeii\" Doesn't Give a Junk Auteur Enough to Do", "site": "@Metro_US", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "9F42CC1BA36D4325E006BBA620C3B678", "robots": "index,follow,noodp,noydir", "mediatype": "Article", "keywords": "Movies,Region National,movies,Emily Browning, Kiefer Sutherland, Kit Harrington, Mount Vesuvius, movies, Paul W.S.
