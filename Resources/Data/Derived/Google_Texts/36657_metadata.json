Peter Hvizdak \u2014 New Haven Register\n\nHAMDEN >> For Denise Doheney, it\u2019s a choice between buying her children the supplies they need to begin the new school year or paying the rent.\n\nThe Hamden resident has worked for 18 years as a preschool teacher at Sleeping Giant Day Care, but her $12-an-hour pay isn\u2019t enough to do both, she told a group that included U.S. Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-3, at the Keefe Center Tuesday, where the day-care center is housed.\n\nThe group was there to support a bill in the House of Representatives calling for increased assistance to pay for high-quality child care that is available around the clock, limit the percent of income going toward child care to 10 percent and pay those working in the child-care industry a \u201cliving wage\u201d \u2014 which, they say, is $15 an hour.\n\nIt\u2019s always been hard surviving on the money she makes, Doheney said, but providing care for her two children when she is at work is one of her greatest challenges. She qualifies for them to attend Sleeping Giant Day Care, which is a subsidized program, but even with that help it\u2019s hard making ends meet, she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI love being with children; I love being the one to teach them to write their name and learn their colors,\u201d she said. \u201cI thought I could do this \u2014 I thought I could rub two pennies together and make a $100 bill.\u201d\n\nFor parent Rochelle Palche, it\u2019s a never-ending balancing act to make sure her children are cared for, either by her mother, her mother-in-law, her husband or herself, because the cost of child care is so high. Her mother-in-law\u2019s retirement made that a bit easier, she said, but it\u2019s still difficult for her and her husband. They both work \u2014 he is self-employed, so taking a day off means forgoing a day\u2019s pay. They manage to make it work, but it\u2019s never easy, she said, and she can imagine how difficult it is for those working in the field.\n\n\u201cWe are a family that would be considered making a decent income, but child care would have taken most of our income,\u201d Palche said, which is why they rely on family members to help.\n\n\u201cChild-care workers deserve a living wage,\u201d she said. \u201cThis system is not working for any of us.\u201d\n\nThe lack of affordable child care is at a crisis level, DeLauro said, and those working at day-care centers aren\u2019t making enough money to survive.\n\n\u201cPeople want to work,\u201d DeLauro said, \u201ceven though that basic concept is challenged by the U.S. Congress, who sense that people want a handout. It\u2019s so demeaning to working women in this country.\u201d\n\nNinety-five percent of those working in the child-care field are women, DeLauro said.\n\n\u201cThis is a crisis and we need to face it as a nation,\u201d she said, adding that one answer is to raise the wages of child-care workers to $15 an hour. \u201cI get so fed up when people tell me that raising the wage to $15 an hour will mean the country will go to hell in a handbasket.\u201d\n\nDeLauro said it was the same response to the issue of requiring employers to offer paid sick days, she said. After that was implemented, there was \u201chardly a ripple\u201d of complaints, she said.\n\n\u201cFor many Connecticut families, child care is the single largest expense, larger than a mortgage or rent payment,\u201d DeLauro said. The average cost for child care for one child for a year is $13,000, she said \u2014 $3,000 more than the tuition at a public college.\n\n\u201cAs a nation, we don\u2019t understand that this issue is important to our economic survival,\u201d she said. \u201cI hear from families all the time who say that child care eats up more and more of their paycheck, and they don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d\n\nAside from Papua, New Guinea, the United States is the only nation that views child care as a personal problem rather than a public issue, DeLauro said. \u201cYou have a right to demand more for child care, but child-care workers need to be paid more,\u201d she said. \u201cMost folks in the industry are women, and it\u2019s another example of how we are not dealing with the economic challenges that face women.\u201d\n\nRaising a preschool teacher\u2019s pay from $12 to $15 an hour would mean an income of $30,000 a year, which sounds good but still isn\u2019t enough, said Sleeping Giant Day Care Director Carla Horwitz.\n\n\u201cIn this country, that\u2019s not really a living wage,\u201d Horwitz said.\n\nMany teachers attend school at night to earn associate and bachelor\u2019s degrees, which are becoming mandatory for the job, she said.\n\n\u201cWe say, \u2018That\u2019s great, but we can\u2019t pay you any more,\u2019\u201d Horwitz said. \u201cThere is a tremendous need for subsidies from the government because we just can\u2019t get any more from parents.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "News, New Haven news, CT news, US news, world news.", "title": "Hamden group fights for affordable child care, living wages", "og": {"url": "http://www.nhregister.com/article/NH/20150818/NEWS/150819476", "image": {"width": "1500px", "identifier": "http://www.nhregister.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/NH/20150818/NEWS/150819476/AR/0/AR-150819476.jpg?Maxh=1500&Maxw=1500", "height": "828px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Hamden group fights for affordable child care, living wages"}, "twitter": {"domain": "nhregister.com", "description": "HAMDEN >> For Denise Doheney, it\u2019s a choice between buying her children the supplies they need to begin the new school year or paying the rent.", "title": "Hamden group fights for affordable child care, living wages", "url": "http://www.nhregister.com/article/NH/20150818/NEWS/150819476", "image": {"src": "http://www.nhregister.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/NH/20150818/NEWS/150819476/AR/0/AR-150819476.jpg?Maxh=900&Maxw=900"}, "site": "@nhregister", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id568468308", "iphone": "id520203861", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.newhavenregister"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"admins": 18506000}, "keywords": "News, New Haven news, CT news, US news, world news.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "HAMDEN >> For Denise Doheney, it\u2019s a choice between buying her children the supplies they need to begin the new school year or paying the rent."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc1c0\"", "article_summary": "\u201cYou have a right to demand more for child care, but child-care workers need to be paid more,\u201d she said.\nThe average cost for child care for one child for a year is $13,000, she said \u2014 $3,000 more than the tuition at a public college.\n\u201cFor many Connecticut families, child care is the single largest expense, larger than a mortgage or rent payment,\u201d DeLauro said.\n\u201cPeople want to work,\u201d DeLauro said, \u201ceven though that basic concept is challenged by the U.S. Congress, who sense that people want a handout.\n\u201cWe are a family that would be considered making a decent income, but child care would have taken most of our income,\u201d Palche said, which is why they rely on family members to help."}
