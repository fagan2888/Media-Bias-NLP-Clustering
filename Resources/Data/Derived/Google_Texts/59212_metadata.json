Planned Parenthood has done the same in its new annual report.\n\nObamaCare, Wendy Davis' fashion-conscious filibuster, and the 2012 elections made its list of the top 10 \u201cHistory-Making Moments\u201d of the past year.\n\nThe adoption of ObamaCare topped that list.\n\n\u201cMillions more people begin getting free access to birth control, breast exams, and other preventative care as the Affordable Care Act goes into effect,\u201d the abortion provider's 2012-2013 annual report states.\n\nIt adds that Planned Parenthood \u201cled the fight\u201d to include the HHS mandate, requiring all but a narrowly defined group of \u201creligious institutions\u201d to carry health insurance giving all employees contraception, sterilization, and abortion-inducing drugs without a co-pay.\n\nOpponents of the law say the mandate violates the First Amendment religious liberties of employers, as well as the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.\n\nExperts say the new health care system, the rollout of which was marked by website crashes and soaring cancellation rates, will represent a financial windfall for Planned Parenthood.\n\nThe law going into effect was one of several allegedly epochal events that would have many observers scratching their heads.\n\nNumber six says simply: \u201cWendy stood.\u201d\n\n\u201cState Senator Wendy Davis' filibuster of a draconian abortion law lights a fire in Texas,\u201d the report goes on to say, \u201cas the public rises up against unprecedented attacks on women's health at the state level, from North Dakota to North Carolina.\u201d\n\nDavis famously wore pink sneakers and a catheter during her 11-hour marathon speech opposing a Texas bill to ban abortions after 20 weeks, as well as mandating greater safety regulations at abortion facilities. Her action and a raucous mob temporarily stalled the bill's passage. Governor Rick Perry later signed it into law after calling a special session to ensure its passage.\n\nNumber five on the list are the \u201chistoric elections\u201d in 2012, which culminated in President Barack Obama's re-election. \u201cWomen's health plays a historic and decisive role in the presidential election and in key state elections with the largest gender gap ever recorded,\u201d Planned Parenthood boasts.\n\nIn its annual report the organization also tells donors it is on the \u201coffense in the states,\u201d citing California Governor Jerry Brown's decision to sign a bill allowing non-physicians to perform abortions.\n\nIt also highlights decisions by Illinois and Colorado to mandaet \u201ccomprehensive,\u201d rather than abstinence-based, sex education, another of Planned Parenthood's revenue streams, and touts its \u201cglobal expansion\u201d into western Kenya, lobbying Cosmopolitan magazine to \u201cpromote our brand,\u201d and the establishment of a new program allowing teens to chat or text sexual questions to Planned Parenthood \u201cexperts.\u201d\n\nClick \"like\" if you are PRO-LIFE!\n\n\u201cAlex,\u201d one such purported expert, was heavily criticized recently for telling his young audience on Planned Parenthood's Tumblr, \u201cthere\u2019s nothing bad or unhealthy about having a big number of sexual partners.\u201d The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists having multiple partners as a \u201csexual risk behavior.\u201d\n\nMore recently, Planned Parenthood's Tumblr account answered the question, \u201cCan my trans[gender] girlfriend get me pregnant?\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "LifeSiteNews", "description": "\u201cState Senator Wendy Davis' filibuster of a draconian abortion law lights a fire in Texas,\u201d the report says.", "title": "ObamaCare, Wendy Davis make Planned Parenthood\u2019s top \u201810 history-making moments\u2019 of 2012", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://www.data.lifesitenews.com/images/shutterstock/WendyDavisSmiling-250px_shutterstock_148959365.jpg", "url": "https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/obamacare-wendy-davis-make-planned-parenthoods-top-10-history-making-moment", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "\u201cState Senator Wendy Davis' filibuster of a draconian abortion law lights a fire in Texas,\u201d the report says."}, "description": "\u201cState Senator Wendy Davis' filibuster of a draconian abortion law lights a fire in Texas,\u201d the report says.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "fb": {"admins": 1477213784, "app_id": 132010293551131, "pages": 112623813202}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8402\"", "article_summary": "ObamaCare, Wendy Davis' fashion-conscious filibuster, and the 2012 elections made its list of the top 10 \u201cHistory-Making Moments\u201d of the past year.\nPlanned Parenthood has done the same in its new annual report.\nOpponents of the law say the mandate violates the First Amendment religious liberties of employers, as well as the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.\n\u201cWomen's health plays a historic and decisive role in the presidential election and in key state elections with the largest gender gap ever recorded,\u201d Planned Parenthood boasts.\nExperts say the new health care system, the rollout of which was marked by website crashes and soaring cancellation rates, will represent a financial windfall for Planned Parenthood."}
