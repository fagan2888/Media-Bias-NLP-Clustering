Rep. Mark Takano had a surprising message for one disagreeable constituent during a recent town hall forum in his Southern California district: “This is not a public forum.”

The Democrat’s rebuke, apparently over differences of opinion on immigration reform, came during a Sept. 4 event at the Country Village retirement community, where residents were invited to “come share questions and ideas with your congressman.”

“Citizens were very upset about multiple issues: ObamaCare, VA benefits - or lack there of - and immigration,” said meeting attendee Beth Baumann, who posted video of the event online.

During another portion of the meeting, Rep. Takano assured older voters in his district that Obamacare wouldn’t impact their benefits.

“As far as affecting Medicare, nobody’s benefits were touched,” he said.

But at least one website, Don’t Cut Our Medicare, said residents in the area will see there benefits cut by $1,718.79 per senior.

Rep. Takano didn’t respond to repeated requests for comment from The Washington Times.
