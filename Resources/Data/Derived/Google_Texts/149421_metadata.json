(Photo: Rodney White/The Register)Buy Photo\n\nPatty Judge\u2019s interview with the Des Moines Register on Tuesday helped clarify a few things \u2014 not so much about her positions on issues but on the line of attack Republicans will take against her.\n\nTweets from GOP operatives during the one-hour editorial board session went something like this:\n\nRobert Haus: @pattyforiowa needs to get her hands on a LOT of briefing materials, sorry to say. She is not prepared to be a US Senator #iasen\n\nTim Albrecht: DMR to Judge at the edit board: Yeah, you\u2019ve attacked (Chuck) Grassley but issues? She lists topics but not solutions. No pushback. #iasen\n\nRobert Haus: @DMRegister Ed Bd pressing @pattyforiowa for specifics on issues. Repeatedly, because she's got not much beyond talking points. #iasen\n\nJimmy Centers: \"Hogs still smell\" is about the only thing @pattyforiowa has said confidently in this ed board meeting. #iasen\n\nYou see the theme here: Judge isn\u2019t prepared, she doesn\u2019t understand federal issues, all she has is talking points. The criticism isn\u2019t entirely fair \u2014 political attacks seldom are. But Judge has given her opponents ammunition for complaining that she\u2019s light on details and she gave them more to complain about during Tuesday\u2019s interviews.\n\nFor example, asked why the Register editorial board should endorse her, Judge said: \u201cI think I\u2019ve been on the statewide scene for a long time. This is the fifth time that I\u2019ve been on a state ballot and people are familiar with me. They know what I\u2019ve done throughout my political career.\u201d She mentioned flood recovery, preschool expansion and civil rights issues addressed during her four years as lieutenant governor and concluded by saying she has a \u201cstrong resume\u201d and looks forward to the \u201cnext step.\u201d\n\nSkip Ad Ad Loading... x Embed x Share Patty Judge, Democratic candidate for the U.S. Senate met with The Des Moines Register's editorial board on May 10, 2016 to discuss her primary campaign.\n\nThis was the first question and the most predictable, but Judge gave a limp-noodle answer instead of a galvanizing argument of why she should be Iowa\u2019s next senator.\n\nJudge touted her electability against incumbent Republican Chuck Grassley but was vague about her strategy. She said her campaign plan would include \u201call kinds of media.\u201d Asked about the lack of content on her campaign website, Judge said that\u2019s coming soon, but she\u2019s only been in the race since March. \u201cThis whole social media thing to me is very new,\u201d she said.\n\nOf all of the issues discussed during the meeting, Judge perhaps offered the most detail about making college more affordable. She said she wants to increase Pell grants and allow graduates to refinance their loans. \u201cI would certainly look at a proposal for tuition-free community college for two years if the students kept a certain high grade-point average,\u201d she said. But she confessed she doesn\u2019t understand why student loan rates are so high and why politicians are reluctant to deal with it.\n\nJudge offered one idea for dealing with wage disparity: Raise the minimum wage to $15 per hour nationwide. She said $15 is the right level because it\u2019s \u201ccertainly not sky-high but it is a place that starts to make a wage that people can talk about living on.\u201d\n\nShe would raise the $118,000 payroll tax cap for Social Security. Ideally, she said, the cap would be eliminated, but she suggested she\u2019d be willing to settle for raising it to some unspecified level. She said the Affordable Care Act needs controls on the cost of prescription drugs. She raised the need for stronger, community-based mental health and increasing access to providers but said she didn\u2019t know what the state is doing now.\n\nShe was fuzzy on how the EPA\u2019s Waters of the United States rule would fit into her vision for water quality, yet walked into the Republicans\u2019 line of fire on a hot-button issue for farmers. Asked whether she agrees with EPA\u2019s definition of waters of the U.S., she said, \u201cI think they\u2019re probably on target, and I know a lot of my agricultural people, friends don\u2019t agree with me on that,\u201d she said. \u201cBut again, we are at a point where we have to be serious about improving water quality.\u201d\n\nRepublican operatives leaped on that generally positive assessment of WOTUS. Albrecht tweeted: \u201cAnd there we have it. This gaffe is one you\u2019re going to hear about a lot.\u201d\n\nMy impression is that Judge is trying to convey that she\u2019s capable of working across party lines for solutions and she doesn\u2019t want to be overly prescriptive in her issue positions. That\u2019s a difficult balancing act, however, as she\u2019s also trying to persuade Democratic primary voters that she\u2019s the most experienced both as a candidate and as a policymaker.\n\nIt\u2019s especially tricky in a year when many voters seem to prefer bold pronouncements over picky details. Judge, however, lacks the showy rhetorical finesse that can make voters forget about the nitty-gritty.\n\nRepublicans are deploying the same playbook against Judge that they used successfully against Christie Vilsack\u2019s congressional run in 2012, saying she\u2019s in over her head. Judge is well-grounded in a range of policy experience, but she\u2019s going to have to make it clear she knows exactly what to do in the U.S. Senate and how to do it.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://dmreg.co/1T9DP5y", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Democrat is making it easy for Republicans to attack her for vague policy positions and plans.", "p": {"domain_verify": "372c291dc2b106308d26264f4fba3b10"}, "og": {"site_name": "Des Moines Register", "description": "Democrat is making it easy for Republicans to attack her for vague policy positions and plans.", "title": "Obradovich: GOP hits Patty Judge on fuzzy policy", "url": "http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/opinion/columnists/kathie-obradovich/2016/05/10/obradovich-gop-hits-patty-judge-fuzzy-policy/84199292/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/desmoinesregister.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Democrat is making it easy for Republicans to attack her for vague policy positions and plans.", "title": "Obradovich: GOP hits Patty Judge on fuzzy policy", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c9acf2bc225ef4bca2de6cd58cf4bc0891097a5f/c=371-0-1629-1258&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/05/10/IAGroup/DesMoines/635984774394272065-pattyjudgeeditboard-0047WORKED.JPG", "creator": "@DMRegister", "site": "@DMRegister", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600025120", "fb": {"app_id": 169766623060429}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Persons/Patty Judge", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Persons/Patty Judge", "title": "Obradovich: GOP hits Patty Judge on fuzzy policy", "author": "Kathie Obradovich", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "opinion/columnists/kathie-obradovich", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ce212a9614b585a8ce803751e25fd440126667bf/c=528-0-1472-1258/local/-/media/2016/05/10/IAGroup/DesMoines/635984774394272065-pattyjudgeeditboard-0047WORKED.JPG", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b5d84b8ecfad522261854bb602008ac4a4ae14b6/c=371-0-1629-1258/local/-/media/2016/05/10/IAGroup/DesMoines/635984774394272065-pattyjudgeeditboard-0047WORKED.JPG", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/bec37bd50716b3965a49a6874d38e8f2aac73b46/c=163-0-1836-1258/local/-/media/2016/05/10/IAGroup/DesMoines/635984774394272065-pattyjudgeeditboard-0047WORKED.JPG", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ccdf605a2cca547ebd162a30382cdbe7d5907f93/c=0-64-2000-1194&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2016/05/10/IAGroup/DesMoines/635984774394272065-pattyjudgeeditboard-0047WORKED.JPG", "publishtime": "2016-05-10T17:14:52.507000-05:00", "shorthed": "GOP hits Patty Judge on fuzzy policy", "articleid": 84199292, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/dd86991a8b723f537012b97497473f87bac65a91/c=0-64-2000-1194/local/-/media/2016/05/10/IAGroup/DesMoines/635984774394272065-pattyjudgeeditboard-0047WORKED.JPG", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/221b9fc21a553af3635947751b48ee7d4d8ab25e/c=648-0-1352-1258/local/-/media/2016/05/10/IAGroup/DesMoines/635984774394272065-pattyjudgeeditboard-0047WORKED.JPG"}}}, "article_summary": "Buy Photo Patty Judge, Democratic candidate for US Senate, meets with the Des Moines Register editorial board Tuesday May 10, 2016.\nTweets from GOP operatives during the one-hour editorial board session went something like this:Robert Haus: @pattyforiowa needs to get her hands on a LOT of briefing materials, sorry to say.\nSkip Ad Ad Loading... x Embed x Share Patty Judge tells The Des Moines Register's editorial board that water quality is a crisis point and discusses the EPA's role in regulating bodies of water.\nFor example, asked why the Register editorial board should endorse her, Judge said: \u201cI think I\u2019ve been on the statewide scene for a long time.\n#iasenYou see the theme here: Judge isn\u2019t prepared, she doesn\u2019t understand federal issues, all she has is talking points."}
