They lived modestly. They had health insurance. They saved.\n\n\u201cWe had a normal life,\u201d Stephanie Dufek said.\n\nThen her husband got sick.\n\nIn roughly a year, the family incurred more than $20,000 in medical bills, shattering their finances.\n\nTheir experience shows that even families with health insurance face risks when confronted with a serious illness. And more families have found themselves in this situation as health plans with high deductibles \u2014 and particularly with high caps on out-of-pocket expenses \u2014 have proliferated.\n\nLike many families, the Dufeks had a health plan with a high deductible \u2014 $4,000 in their case. But that\u2019s not what overwhelmed them.\n\nThe first blow came from the health plan\u2019s high cap on out-of-pocket expenses and then from facing the same expense again with the start of a new year.\n\nThat\u2019s a risk that remains even with the new limits on out-of-pocket expenses under the Affordable Care Act. The law caps those expenses for an individual at $6,600 this year. But that means that someone with a health plan that runs on the calendar year and who is diagnosed with a serious illness in October, for example, can easily incur $13,200 in medical bills in just a few months, on top of regular insurance premiums.\n\nThe Dufeks\u2019 health plan wasn\u2019t covered by the Affordable Care Act, and their plan had an unusually high limit on out-of-pocket expenses for hospital stays: The couple paid 10 percent coinsurance for up to $10,000 a year.\n\nThe result was a total of $14,000 in expenses from the deductible and coinsurance \u2014 and the prospect of an additional $14,000 in bills the next year.\n\nTheir situation is unusual. But it happens, and when it does, the results can be devastating.\n\nA report by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau found that medical debts account for 52 percent of the actions by debt collection agencies that appear on consumer credit reports, according to a report by the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nThe report also showed that many of the people who had been contacted by collection agencies about medical bills previously had no history of credit problems.\n\nPremium with a risk\n\nHealth plans with high deductibles and high caps on out-of-pocket expenses have become widespread. They are a way of lowering premiums, and that benefits most people because they have the good fortune to be healthy. Many believe that these plans had a part in slowing the rise in health care spending by encouraging people to be better health care consumers.\n\nBut plans with high out-of-pocket expenses also shift risk, particularly to people who need health insurance the most: those who become seriously ill.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a perfect allocation of risk,\u201d said Martha Gaines, a lawyer and director of the Center for Patient Partnerships at the University of Wisconsin Law School. \u201cIt\u2019s a bad way to take care of people who are chronically sick.\u201d\n\nDan Dufek, 43, who was close to 6-foot-5 and 220 pounds, began to have back pain in early 2013. He first went to a chiropractor, believing he had a herniated disc. The pain got worse. Dufek, who delivered restaurant supplies, continued working, telling himself that he would just \u201cpush through it.\u201d\n\n\u201cBills have to be paid,\u201d he said. \u201cI have a daughter.\u201d\n\nIn October of that year, he finally relented and went to a physician who specialized in back pain. \u201cI look back on it now and realize that I was in denial,\u201d Dufek said.\n\nThe physician ordered an MRI that showed a large tumor in his spine.\n\nIt was diagnosed as a rare, noncancerous tumor. The surgery to remove it took nine hours and required an orthopedic surgeon and a neurosurgeon. The doctors thought Dan might never walk again.\n\nThe family hit the $10,000 limit on coinsurance for hospitalization in the health plan. Within a few months, a new plan year would start, and they again would have a $4,000 deductible and the prospect paying 10 percent of the cost of any hospital stays.\n\nThose sorts of financially punishing bills undercut the reason people have insurance.\n\n\u201cThe most basic reason for insurance is to protect you from those catastrophic costs,\u201d said Thomas Buchmueller, a professor of risk management and insurance at the University of Michigan.\n\nAn estimated 4 million people with middle-class incomes \u2014 those earning about $47,000 to $95,000 for a family of four \u2014 were underinsured in 2012, according to a report by the Commonwealth Fund last year.\n\nThe report defined underinsured people as those who had health insurance but still spent 10 percent or more of their incomes on medical costs.\n\nA torrent of bills followed Dan Dufek\u2019s diagnosis and surgery.\n\n\u201cI can bring you the box,\u201d Stephanie Dufek said. The cardboard box \u2014 a carton that once held boxes of Girl Scout cookies \u2014 is where she throws the medical bills.\n\nIt is half full.\n\nSome of the bills are incomprehensible, leaving the couple baffled by what is covered by insurance and what they owe. A bill dated Oct. 31, 2014, for an MRI, for example, lists charges of $18,499.90, a payment adjustment of $16,959.90 and a patient balance of $1,514.60. This was long after the family had surpassed the deductible on their health plan.\n\nDevastated finances\n\nAlthough the family once had savings, they now are on several payment plans.\n\nAfter recovering from his surgery, Daniel Dufek, who walks with a cane, went back on the job for a few weeks but soon realized that he could no longer work. He had been prudent and had long-term disability insurance, which now pays about half his previous wage.\n\nStephanie Dufek, who had worked part time, went to work full time in April. The job provides health benefits but has a $3,000 deductible. Between their two health plans, the deductibles totaled $7,000 last year. The family went through both of them.\n\nOn a recent night, Stephanie Dufek had just written a $60 check to a hospital \u2014 money that she said could buy shoes for her daughter or groceries or a nice dinner out.\n\nThat\u2019s in the past.\n\nThey no longer put money in their daughter\u2019s college fund. They recently had to buy a furnace. They keep the thermostat low. And their tax refund is already accounted for.\n\n\u201cYou get your taxes done,\u201d Dan Dufek said, \u201cand it\u2019s going to go to medical bills.\u201d\n\nGuy Boulton,\n\nMilwaukee Journal Sentinel", "article_metadata": {"description": "People with health insurance can still get slammed with high bills when hit with a serious illness, shattering their finances.", "og": {"description": "People with health insurance can still get slammed with high bills when hit with a serious illness, shattering their finances.", "title": "With year-end illness, high deductible can strike again on Jan. 1", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20150313-with-year-end-illness-high-deductible-can-strike-again-on-jan.-1.ece", "image": {"width": 1280, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20150313-underinsured.jpg.ece/BINARY/original/UNDERINSURED.jpg", "height": 830}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2015-03-14T02:48:06Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2015-03-14T02:48:06Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"With year-end illness, high deductible can strike again on Jan. 1\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20150313-with-year-end-illness-high-deductible-can-strike-again-on-jan.-1.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20150313-underinsured.jpg.ece/BINARY/original/UNDERINSURED.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"2217317\", \"pub_date\": \"2015-03-14T02:48:06Z\", \"section\": \"Economy & You Headlines\", \"author\": \"\", \"tags\": [\"dallas\", \"dallas fort worth\", \"dallas news\", \"dallas fort worth news\", \"dfw news\", \"dallas local news\", \"dallas fort worth local news\", \"dallas newspaper\", \"dallas morning news\", \"dallas morning news newspaper\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 1043783589, "page_id": 20946638799, "app_id": 258290334265148}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"image": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20150313-underinsured.jpg.ece/ALTERNATES/w660/UNDERINSURED.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-03-14T02:48:06Z"}}, "news_keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb3d3\"", "article_summary": "Like many families, the Dufeks had a health plan with a high deductible \u2014 $4,000 in their case.\nTheir experience shows that even families with health insurance face risks when confronted with a serious illness.\nAnd more families have found themselves in this situation as health plans with high deductibles \u2014 and particularly with high caps on out-of-pocket expenses \u2014 have proliferated.\nThe cardboard box \u2014 a carton that once held boxes of Girl Scout cookies \u2014 is where she throws the medical bills.\nThe first blow came from the health plan\u2019s high cap on out-of-pocket expenses and then from facing the same expense again with the start of a new year."}
