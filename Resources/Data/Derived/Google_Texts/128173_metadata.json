COURTESY OF Zengeler CLEANERS\n\nAnn Marie Peters, from left, Karen Goers and Allison Heverin are co-founders of Interview Savvy, a Downers Grove-based firm that trains Millennials how to prepare for job interviews. COURTESY OF INTERVIEW SAVVY\n\nA banking executive and behavior coach Ann Marie Peters, along with human resources expert Karen Goers and lawyer Allison Heverin, co-founded Interview Savvy, a consulting firm that helps Millennials better prepare for job interviews.\n\nIn the last 3 years, the Downers Grove neighbors and friends have helped about 1,000 jobseekers, including some non-millennials who have been unemployed for more than six months.\n\nBut many likely don't know what brought the three women together in 2010. Singing.\n\nPeters, Goers and Heverin met through their children, who attend the same school. The school started a fundraiser about five years ago similar to Battle of the Bands. The three friends, along with four others, formed \"Rage Against the Washing Machine,\" a singing group that performs each year at the fundraiser. They continue to meet regularly throughout the year to prepare for that main event.\n\nThey each love singing and purposely picked an unusual name that's just fun.\n\n\"It's a great collaborative way to find friendships by singing and presenting a fun community outlet to raise money,\" Peters said. \"At the end of the day, it helped us to start a business that helps other people.\"\n\nPeters was the PTA president and held other positions over the years, so when the school created this fundraiser, she was ready.\n\n\"The parents were all put together randomly to perform,\" she said.\n\nThey also performed elsewhere around the community and sing popular songs. They also are accompanied by an acoustical guitar.\n\n\"Well, it's almost a cappella,\" she joked.\n\nWhen they aren't singing, their company is hired by companies and state governments to help people present themselves in the best way to interview and get jobs.\n\nInterview Savvy recently was selected by the Kentucky Career Center to co-host the state's first long-term unemployed virtual career fair on Oct. 14.\n\nPeters also said they are conducting an international webinar on networking at the University of Chicago on Oct. 20 with another woman in the same band who's an executive coach. The webinar is in preparation for the University of Chicago Alumni November Networking month where grads worldwide will get together for special events and networking.\n\nThe firm also is planning to expand with more services to help the unemployed.\n\n\"This is an untapped pool of potential employees and this could help them,\" Peters said.\n\nWine and jewels in Batavia\n\nRob and Karen Hollis have hosted a number of special events over the years at their K. Hollis Jewelers in Batavia. So it was a natural decision to remodel to add The Wine Bar @ K. Hollis Jewelers, which will be unveiled on Oct. 9. They said it fits in with their shopping vision for customers. Besides the remodeling job, they had to obtain a liquor license. \"The city was open to the idea and extremely accommodating. We are now able to serve wine to our customers throughout the day while shopping or during special events,\" said Rob Hollis. They enlisted Cruver Creations, Windmill Countertops and artist Jim Jenkins for The Wine Bar.\n\nScore with new coffee\n\nConnie, Jarrett and Brittney Payton last week were on hand to help launch a new coffee line called Payton Premium Coffee by Batavia-based Papanicholas. The coffee will be sold exclusively by Jewel-Osco. A portion of the coffee sales will go to the Walter and Connie Payton Foundation, which helps abused and neglected underprivileged children, and the Jarrett Payton Foundation, which works to provide leadership skills in children and adolescents. Jarrett and his wife Trish live in Hoffman Estates. Connie and Brittney with her husband all live in Chicago.\n\nFastTracks\n\nJohn Miller, a CPA from Naperville, has joined Klein Hall CPAs in Aurora.
