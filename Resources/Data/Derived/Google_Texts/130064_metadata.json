When a vehicle reaches a pre-selected speed, the smartphone\u2019s touch-screen is disabled, making texting and other functions impossible. Administrators of the app can set it so people who are passengers in vehicles can still use their phones.\n\nAdministrators also can track in real time where the phones they own are and how much battery life they have. The app also alerts its administrators if it has been disabled by a user.\n\n\u201cThis is a great tool for parents and business owners who want to see where their child or employee is,\u201d Meers said.\n\nBill Bell, executive director of Kentucky\u2019s Transportation Cabinet, said in a news release that the cabinet has extensively tested the application, and he believes it will help reduce \u201cescalating incidents of distracted driving deaths and collisions in Kentucky and the U.S.\u201d\n\nDriver distractions were noted as primary factors in more than 52,500 motor vehicle collisions in Kentucky last year, according to a Transportation Cabinet news release. About 9,000 of those collisions caused serious injuries and 163 resulted in deaths.\n\n\u201cThese numbers account for 43 percent of the total crashes and 25 percent of the total fatal crashes occurring on Kentucky\u2019s roadways last year,\u201d Bell said.\n\nTextLimit.com works with all Android, Apple and Blackberry 3G and 4G LTE devices, Meers said.\n\nMeers, the former chief operating officer for commercial operations at Vision Airlines, and his company also developed an app last year that can be used to deter drunken driving.\n\n\u201cNo DUI Kentucky\u201d has a one-touch dial feature for reporting drunken drivers, a list of local taxi services and sober ride programs, and a blood alcohol content calculator.\n\nMobile Life Solutions teamed up with the Kentucky Office of Highway Safety to provide the new app free of charge to Kentucky motorists.\n\n\u201cIf we can help one person out of an accident, then we\u2019ve done our job,\u201d Meers said.\n\nKentucky and West Virginia motorists can download the \u201cTextLimit\u201c app \u2014 which normally sells for $24.99 \u2014 free of charge throughout April as part of National Distracted Driving Awareness Month.\n\nReporter Patrick T.
