Green doesn\u2019t know whether he will spike the ball, do a dance or nonchalantly hand the ball to an official, but he can\u2019t wait to find out what he will do when he finally puts six points on the scoreboard.\n\nIn his three-plus seasons with the Broncos, Green hasn\u2019t scored on any of his 19 pass receptions.\n\n\u201cIt has been a long time since I\u2019ve scored a touchdown,\u201d Green said Thursday after practice. \u201cI\u2019ll probably be super excited if it happens. I\u2019ll go crazy, but I can\u2019t go overboard. Julius (teammate Julius Thomas) will come out there and calm me down.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s another part of Green\u2019s game that drew raves in a rejuvenated Denver running game that overpowered the Miami Dolphins last Sunday. With Green at tight end, the Broncos rushed for 201 yards \u2014 including 167 yards from undrafted running back C.J. Anderson.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a versatile guy, but I like to block,\u201d Green said. \u201cThat\u2019s what this team has me doing and I don\u2019t mind doing it.\u201d\n\nGreen has only two receptions this season, for 18 yards, but he has missed some games because of an injured ankle. In comparison, Thomas has 40 receptions for 426 yards and 12 touchdowns and Jacob Tamme has 11 catches for 87 yards and two touchdowns.\n\nBroncos coach John Fox said Green\u2019s statistics are deceiving and possibly influenced by the game plan.\n\n\u201cI think historically he has done that,\u201d Fox said when asked whether Green could become a factor in Denver\u2019s offense as a pass catcher. \u201cWe\u2019ve definitely leaned on Julius Thomas no doubt as far as a receiver, but Virgil\u2019s very capable.\u201d\n\nGreen has to look back to his senior year at Nevada to remember his last touchdown. In the Wolf Pack\u2019s 2010 season, he had 35 receptions for 515 yards and five touchdowns.\n\nBut Green doesn\u2019t dispute that blocking is his specialty.\n\n\u201cIn blocking you have to be technically sound, but there\u2019s also a huge mental part to it,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to say to yourself that the player across from me isn\u2019t going to beat me. Absolutely, I\u2019m a tough guy. My dad was in the military. I was taught to never back down from anybody.\u201d\n\nGreen\u2019s teammates know him by his performance on the field. They call him \u201cThe Hulk.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s obvious what he does as a blocker, but it helps,\u201d Anderson said.\n\nAdded offensive tackle Ryan Clady: \u201cIn order to run the ball, you have to have a good blocking tight end at the point of attack. He was a factor for sure last week.\u201d\n\nGreen\u2019s primary focus is lining up against elite defensive linemen and learning what he can to improve his game.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not focused on scoring touchdowns,\u201d Green said. \u201cI just want to help this team win and get to the Super Bowl.\u201d\n\nStill, it will be interesting to see whether it will be a dance, a spike of the ball or a casual handoff to an official after Green scores the first touchdown of his NFL career.\n\nIrv Moss: 303-954-1296, imoss@denverpost.com or twitter.com/irvmoss", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Tight end Virgil Green receptive to blocking for Denver Broncos", "title": "Tight end Virgil Green receptive to blocking for Denver Broncos", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/11/28/tight-end-virgil-green-receptive-to-blocking-for-denver-broncos-2/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141128__20141129_B3_SP29FBNBRONXp1.jpg", "height": 513}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141128__20141129_B3_SP29FBNBRONXp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-11-28T20:53:01+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-21T02:33:47+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Virgil Green"}, "article_summary": "\u201cIt has been a long time since I\u2019ve scored a touchdown,\u201d Green said Thursday after practice.\nWith Green at tight end, the Broncos rushed for 201 yards \u2014 including 167 yards from undrafted running back C.J.\nIf and when it happens, Broncos tight end Virgil Green doesn\u2019t have a predetermined celebration script.\nIn his three-plus seasons with the Broncos, Green hasn\u2019t scored on any of his 19 pass receptions.\nJulius (teammate Julius Thomas) will come out there and calm me down.\u201dIt\u2019s another part of Green\u2019s game that drew raves in a rejuvenated Denver running game that overpowered the Miami Dolphins last Sunday."}
