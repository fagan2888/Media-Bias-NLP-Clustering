She has been selling real estate for more than a year. \u201cSo far, so good. I worked as a CPA in the estate and gifting specialty. I got my undergraduate degree at UW-Milwaukee, earning my CPA license shortly after graduating. I made the switch because I wanted the flexibility of schedule real estate offers as well as more contact with people,\u201d she said in this edited interview.\n\n\n\nWhat do you enjoy about selling real estate?\n\nI enjoy meeting people and helping them, whether it\u2019s selling their home and navigating the process or assisting buyers in finding their home and working through the offer and negotiations. Real estate actually uses some of my skills, including the desire to assist in the process and negotiating with other agents.\n\nHow do you consider yourself to be different than other agents?\n\nI work to be different than when I\u2019ve worked with realtors as a buyer or seller myself, by really listening to my clients rather than just telling them what I think. I work to honor what they like and want.\n\nWhat role should an agent play for a client?\n\nA guide. People are very smart and they don\u2019t need a realtor to tell them what to do. Rather, get advice about the home they\u2019re trying to buy or sell. We provide guidance in terms of what\u2019s happening in the market or guidance regarding how the other side might view a particular challenge which might arise. Also, provide advice when working with lenders to help them find the right one to make the closing process so much easier.\n\nWhat qualities make for a good realtor?\n\nThe ability to maintain communication between buyers and sellers when issues arise, and having the true desire to help buyers find a home, which can require many home showings.\n\nHave you had any mentors?\n\nI\u2019ve met people I enjoy working with and who inspire me, such as my office manager, and I look to her for guidance.\n\nWhat have you learned from your clients?\n\nTo be understanding with buyers and sellers and, at times, this can be an emotional business. Buyers and sellers may not remain calm when an offer doesn\u2019t go through, at times. We must assure them another buyer will come or another house will be found.\n\nWhat\u2019s the best advice you\u2019ve been given?\n\nNot to get disheartened if it takes a while to sell a house or if it takes some time to build my business.\n\nWhat\u2019s the best advice you give to clients?\n\nI tell buyers to make sure they are pre-approved for financing and to let me help them understand the market for the types of homes they\u2019re looking for and the location. Sellers should try to take an honest look at the market when pricing the home so it sells, versus sitting on the market.\n\nHow have you developed as a realtor since the beginning?\n\nFor both my buyers and sellers, I\u2019ve changed the way I look at a house. Now, I look at a house more from the perspective of whether it has a good foundation, roof or mechanicals rather than mostly the aesthetics of the home.\n\nWhat\u2019s your favorite part of the process when working with clients?\n\nI really like selling houses, learning what buyers are looking for and then going out and finding it for them. What I really like is when either my buyer or seller gets an accepted offer, which is a really nice feeling. There is still work to be done afterwards, but everyone is happy.\n\nWhat is the biggest challenge clients face in today\u2019s market?\n\nAs prices go up, updated homes increase in price and generally sell faster. Houses which haven\u2019t been updated tend to sit a bit more on the market and don\u2019t show very large price increases.\n\nWhat\u2019s your business philosophy?\n\nTo be honest and act with integrity\n\nWhat role does technology play in selling homes?\n\nIt\u2019s extremely important. Technology is used for everything \u2013 communication, listings and photos. When you list a home online, it\u2019s like the first showing, and it might be the most important factor after setting the price.\n\nHow do you relax in your down time?\n\nI like to cook, explore museums and read.\n\nWhat professional/charitable organizations are you involved with?\n\nRight now, I\u2019m working to get my schedule set so I can set time aside to volunteer. I\u2019d like to work with the Wisconsin Humane Society or something involving animals.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"title": "Carrie Caan, RE/MAX Lakeside", "og": {"url": "http://www.jsonline.com/homes/realtoroftheweek/311328251.html", "image": {"width": 260, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/Carrie-Caan-photo.jpg", "height": 325}, "type": "article", "description": "After 15 years as a Certified Public Accountant, Carrie Caan decided to get her real estate license in March 2014.
