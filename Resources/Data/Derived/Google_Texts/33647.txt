FRANKLIN, Tenn. (AP) - The daughter of a soldier from Tennessee who died in Afghanistan has organized a 5K race in honor of her father.

WTVF-TV in Nashville reported (http://bit.ly/1h2mLPI ) that Samantha Ponder of Franklin plans to donate the money from raised from Saturday’s run to help send children to Snowball Express, a yearly gathering of kids who share the painful experience of losing a mom or dad in war.

Ponder’s father, Master Sergeant Trey Ponder, died in Afghanistan in 2005. Trey Ponder, 36, of Franklin, was assigned to Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (Airborne) at Fort Campbell, Kentucky. He died June 28 when an MH-47 Chinook helicopter crashed while ferrying personnel to a battle against militants in eastern Afghanistan.

“Today was a celebration of my dad and many other people’s parents and lost loved ones,” Samantha Ponder said.

Samantha Ponder says the funds raised through registration fees should help sent up to 80 children to Snowball Express for a weekend next year.

Samantha Ponder says the 5K run was such a success this year, they’re already planning on holding another one next year.
