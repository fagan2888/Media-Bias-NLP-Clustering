HOPKINSVILLE, Ky. (WKRN) – First it was a heckler, and then Donald Trump that presidential front runner Hillary Clinton took on Monday just north of Nashville.

She was in Hopkinsville, Kentucky, for a rally ahead of the state’s democratic primary on Tuesday.

Clinton challenged the heckler to meet her on the side after the speech, but the shouting woman soon quietly left with police.

She then paid homage to the famous Army post just down the road.

“We need a commander in chief that will also take care of everybody at Fort Campbell, take good care of the men and women in uniform. Take good care of our vets who have served this country,” she told the crowd.

The presidential hopeful also called Trump a loose cannon on defense while saying his tax plan was written by a billionaire for billionaires.

“He has written a tax plan that I say is a tax plan written by a billionaires for billionaires. That is exactly what it is,” Clinton said.

“He has said he is going to repeal the Affordable Care Act, get rid of it, but he won’t tell you what he will replace it with because, you know what, you don’t want to hear what he wants to replace it with,” she contined. “And he has all this loose-cannon kind of talk about foreign policy and national security.”

Then she talked about being bipartisan.

“If someone has a better idea, I don’t care if it’s Republican idea, Independent idea or Democratic idea, I don’t care where it comes from , if it’s a good idea, then by definition it’s an American idea,” she explained.

Mrs. Clinton barely mentioned her Democratic Party challenger Bernie Sanders.
