It too is playing a role in preventing an epidemic. Research has shown that people who lack health insurance delay or skip health care services or substitute home remedies or over the counter drugs for doctor visits that can diagnose and prevent the spread of communicable disease. People who have access to routine needed care are less likely to be susceptible to disease, leading to improvements in individual and community resilience.\n\nThe law also establishes a Prevention and Public Health Fund that provides state and local governments with additional resources that can help \u201cprevent, detect, and respond to disease outbreaks\u201d and includes provisions that can be \u201cleveraged to integrate preparedness into daily health care and to help create stronger routine and emergency health care delivery systems that can surge to respond to disasters.\u201d\n\nUltimately, Americans can feel secure that Ebola will be contained in the United States because we\u2019ve established a robust government funded health care system that, in collaboration with the private sector, protects everyone from a public health catastrophe.
