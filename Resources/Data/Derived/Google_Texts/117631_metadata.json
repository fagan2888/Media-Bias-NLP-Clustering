A compromise between Democratic Gov. Maggie Hassan and Senate Republicans, the program will send Medicaid recipients to the exchange and give them Medicaid dollars to pay for their coverage.\n\n..\n\nMedicaid patients are low-income people who often have spotty health care histories, and the expansion provides mental health and addiction recovery services that some of them have had little access to.\n\n..\n\nMaine Community estimated that claims from the Medicaid patients will be 61 percent higher than its current risk pool, according to a statement filed with healthcare.gov.\n\n\n\nTom Policelli, the chief executive of Minuteman, said his actuaries had similar numbers when they worked out the proposed increase.\n\n..\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a different population. You\u2019re mixing two different groups of people,\u201d said Policelli, who stressed that actuarial numbers covering the Medicaid population continue to be refined.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all scrambling, looking at the data,\u201d he said.\n\n..\n\nIn a statement, Hassan\u2019s spokesman stressed that regulators must approve premium increases. Spokesman William Hinkle also said rates should drop as Medicaid patients enter the exchange.\n\n\n\n\u201cAs the expansion population moves to private coverage on the marketplace, it will help encourage more competition that will help improve affordability and increase choices for all New Hampshire citizens,\u201d Hinkle wrote.\n\n..\n\nBoth Policelli and ACA advocates stressed that the proposed rates are an early filing.\n\n\n\n\u201cThese specific rates will be subject to vigorous rate review and revision and the final rates consumers will see this fall will reflect the breadth of choice and competition in the marketplace,\u201d said Andy Slavitt, acting administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\n\n..\n\nOn July 15, carriers can alter their proposal, Policelli said.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn our own view, it is always easier to go down than go up, so we started up,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nIn a statement, the free-market advocacy group Americans for Prosperity New Hampshire said working families face stagnant wages, and the rate hikes could send them into a tailspin.\n\n..\n\n\u201cThe proposed Obamacare rate hikes for 2016 in New Hampshire clearly tear apart any notion that the Affordable Care Act is affordable,\u201d said Greg Moore, state director for the group.\n\n\n\nNew Hampshire has five carriers who offer health insurance through the exchange. Healthcare.gov lists only those that seek double-digit increases.\n\n..\n\nColin Manning, a spokesman for Anthem Blue Cross, said he couldn\u2019t discuss Anthem\u2019s proposed rates for competitive reasons.\n\n\n\nBut he said Anthem rates were essentially flat for 2015, and the company will continue to provide stability to the market.\n\n..\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to comment on the rate filing of another carrier, but through our responsible approach we\u2019ve been able to offer realistic rates and stability to the market,\u201d Manning said.\n\n\n\nAs of the end of March, 45,600 New Hampshire residents were enrolled in a plan through the exchange, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. About 66 percent received subsidies to help pay their premiums, one of the lowest percentages in the country, the centers said.\n\n..\n\nThe Massachusetts-based Minuteman entered the New Hampshire market in 2015 with significantly low rates. For example, its silver plan premiums for a 50-year-old non-smoker were $304 and $317 a month; Anthem was $368; Harvard Pilgrim, $383.\n\n..\n\nmhayward@unionleader.com\n\n..", "article_metadata": {"description": "Two insurance carriers on the Obamacare exchange are attributing proposed double-digit premium increases to next year's private-market alterations to the New Hampshire Medicaid program.", "title": "Insurers request big rate hikes, citing coming Medicaid changes | New Hampshire", "og": {"site_name": "UnionLeader.com", "description": "Two insurance carriers on the Obamacare exchange are attributing proposed double-digit premium increases to next year's private-market alterations to the New Hampshire Medicaid program.", "title": "Insurers request big rate hikes, citing coming Medicaid changes | New Hampshire", "url": "http://www.unionleader.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20150603/NEWS12/150609727", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.unionleader.com/images/unionleaderlogo.jpg", "height": 314}, "type": "article"}, "section": "Health", "robots": "NOARCHIVE, NOODP, NOYDIR", "keywords": "Health, Politics, Top Section Stories, Obamacare,", "fb": {"app_id": 665237656918292}, "date": "2015-06-03 00:00:00", "twitter": {"description": "Two insurance carriers on the Obamacare exchange are attributing proposed double-digit premium increases to next year's private-market alterations to the New Hampshire Medicaid program.", "title": "Insurers request big rate hikes, citing coming Medicaid changes | New Hampshire", "url": "http://www.unionleader.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20150603/NEWS12/150609727", "image": "http://www.unionleader.com/images/unionleaderlogo.jpg", "site": "@UnionLeader", "card": "summary$t"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1f43\"", "article_summary": "Insurers request big rate hikes, citing coming Medicaid changesTwo insurance carriers on the Obamacare exchange are attributing proposed double-digit premium increases to next year\u2019s private-market alterations to the New Hampshire Medicaid program.\n..Colin Manning, a spokesman for Anthem Blue Cross, said he couldn\u2019t discuss Anthem\u2019s proposed rates for competitive reasons.\nIn a statement, Hassan\u2019s spokesman stressed that regulators must approve premium increases.\nMaggie Hassan and Senate Republicans, the program will send Medicaid recipients to the exchange and give them Medicaid dollars to pay for their coverage.\n..Maine Community Health Options asked for premium increases between 19 and 22 percent."}
