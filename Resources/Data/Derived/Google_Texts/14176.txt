Energy company OGE will house its new headquarters in a 14-to-16 story tower that will be built where the Stage Center currently stands in downtown Oklahoma City.



Developers announced in July they would demolish Stage Center -- which closed in 2010 due to severe flooding â€“ and build a high-rise in its place. Kestrel Investments owns the property. On Tuesday, the developer revealed OGE would be the anchor tenant in the new building.

According to a news release, OGE will consolidate many of its metro-area employees into the new building.

"We are excited about bringing our employees together in a new corporate headquarters," said Peter B. Delaney, chairman, president and CEO of OGE Energy Corp. "We have a large number of employees scattered throughout downtown Oklahoma City at multiple facilities that are outdated and unable to meet our future needs."

Kestrel released a conceptual master plan for development of the three-acre property, which is located between Sheridan and California, and Dewey and Walker. Along with the office tower, the developer's plans include multi-level parking and lease space for retail stores and restaurants.

Kestrel says by 4 p.m. Tuesday, it will file for a demolition permit from the Downtown Design Review Committee.
