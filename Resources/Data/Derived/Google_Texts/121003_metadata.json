Those standards and remedies for delays unfairly affected the freight industry, whose trains run on the same rails, the industry group said.\n\nAll the justices agreed to overturn the lower-court ruling in which the Association of American Railroads had prevailed at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit: that Amtrak was a strictly private entity and as such Congress was wrong in 2008 to set up a system that allowed it to issue regulations.\n\nThe lower court had based the decision on Congress\u2019s command that Amtrak \u201cis not a department, agency or instrumentality of the United States Government.\u201d\n\nBut Justice Anthony M. Kennedy said saying so does not necessarily make it so.\n\nThe government puts all sorts of demands on Amtrak \u2014 maintaining service between Louisiana and Florida, for instance, or offering reduced fares for elderly or disabled passengers \u2014 not to mention giving it subsidies of about $1 billion a year, Kennedy said.\n\n\u201cAmtrak was created by the Government, is controlled by the Government, and operates for the Government\u2019s benefit,\u201d Kennedy wrote. Thus, in working with the Federal Railroad Administration to issue the \u201cmetrics and standards\u201d for performance, \u201cAmtrak acted as a governmental entity for purposes of the Constitution\u2019s separation of powers provisions.\u201d\n\nSo far, so good, Kennedy wrote for seven other members of the court. But they all agreed that was not the end of the matter.\n\nBecause the appeals court based its decision on its finding that Amtrak is a private entity, it did not address other claims by the freight industry that Amtrak\u2019s actions were unconstitutional.\n\nThe lower court must now consider questions about how Amtrak\u2019s board is appointed and whether there are due process concerns with giving Amtrak regulatory authority over its own industry, Kennedy wrote.\n\nJustices Samuel A. Alito Jr. and Clarence Thomas expanded on those concerns in opinions far longer than Kennedy\u2019s.\n\n\u201cThis case, on its face, may seem to involve technical issues, but in discussing trains, tracks, metrics, and standards, a vital constitutional principle must not be forgotten: Liberty requires accountability,\u201d wrote Alito, who also joined Kennedy\u2019s opinion.\n\nThomas did not and said the court should have gone further.\n\n\u201cWe have overseen and sanctioned the growth of an administrative system that concentrates the power to make laws and the power to enforce them in the hands of a vast and unaccountable administrative apparatus that finds no comfortable home in our constitutional structure,\u201d Thomas wrote. \u201cThe end result may be trains that run on time (although I doubt it), but the cost is to our Constitution and the individual liberty it protects.\u201d\n\nThe case is Department of Transportation v. Association of American Railroads.\n\nFla. death penalty case\n\nThe court said it would consider next term whether part of Florida\u2019s process for imposing the death penalty is unconstitutional.\n\nThe court said it would take up the case of Timothy Hurst, who was convicted in the 1998 murder of his manager, Cynthia Harrison, at the Pensacola Popeye\u2019s restaurant where he worked. Hurst stabbed and killed Harrison, left her body in a freezer, and stole more than $1,000. A jury voted 7 to 5 that Hurst should receive the death penalty, and the Florida Supreme Court upheld the decision.\n\nHurst\u2019s petition to the court contains several questions, including the role of the judge vs. the jury regarding the aggravating factors that can justify a penalty of capital punishment and whether jury decisions about the death penalty must be unanimous.\n\nHurst also challenges whether there was adequate consideration of his claim that he is intellectually disabled.\n\nThe case is Hurst v. Florida.\n\nNotre Dame and the ACA\n\nThe justices also told an appeals court Monday that it should reconsider the University of Notre Dame\u2019s objection to providing contraceptive coverage under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe university had contended that because the adverse ruling from the appeals court came before the Supreme Court decided a similar issue in the Hobby Lobby case last summer, the remand was warranted. Without comment, the court agreed and sent the case back to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit.\n\nThe case concerns a part of the ACA that requires employers to provide health insurance coverage that includes no-cost access to contraceptives. Religious organizations such as churches are exempted. And in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby, the court said the Religious Freedom Restoration Act protects some private employers from offering contraceptives that violate the owners\u2019 religious beliefs.\n\nThe Notre Dame case and others like it concern religious-based groups, colleges and nonprofits that also object. The government offers a compromise for such groups, allowing them to opt out of providing the coverage but still letting women receive contraceptives, with the cost covered by the insurer or the government. The groups have said that still makes them complicit in providing the coverage.\n\nWhile the justices told the 7th Circuit to reconsider the issue in light of the Hobby Lobby decision, that may not be much help for Notre Dame. Other courts that have ruled since Hobby Lobby have decided for the government, saying the compromise does not impose a substantial burden on the groups.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The justices overturned a lower-court ruling but raised constitutional concerns about the railroad\u2019s powers.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/robert.barnes.3139", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The justices overturned a lower-court ruling but raised constitutional concerns about the railroad\u2019s powers.", "title": "Supreme Court says Amtrak is more like a public entity than a private firm", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/2015/03/09/dd125130-c691-11e4-aa1a-86135599fb0f_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/03/10/National-Politics/Images/2015-03-09T151208Z_01_WAS704_RTRIDSP_3_USA-COURT-CONTRACEPTION-3569.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@scotusreporter"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/2015/03/09/dd125130-c691-11e4-aa1a-86135599fb0f_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "supreme court news, supreme court amtrak, supreme court notre dame contraceptives, supreme court florida death penalty, supreme court timothy hurst, courts, Supreme Court, Amtrak, railroads, government entities, Association of American railroads, death penalty, Florida, Timothy Hurst, Notre Dame, contraception", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/robert.barnes.3139"}, "eomportal-uuid": "dd125130-c691-11e4-aa1a-86135599fb0f", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "supreme court news, supreme court amtrak, supreme court notre dame contraceptives, supreme court florida death penalty, supreme court timothy hurst, courts, Supreme Court, Amtrak, railroads, government entities, Association of American railroads, death penalty, Florida, Timothy Hurst, Notre Dame, contraception"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe5d9e\"", "article_summary": "\u201cAmtrak was created by the Government, is controlled by the Government, and operates for the Government\u2019s benefit,\u201d Kennedy wrote.\nWithout comment, the court agreed and sent the case back to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit.\nBecause the appeals court based its decision on its finding that Amtrak is a private entity, it did not address other claims by the freight industry that Amtrak\u2019s actions were unconstitutional.\nThe university had contended that because the adverse ruling from the appeals court came before the Supreme Court decided a similar issue in the Hobby Lobby case last summer, the remand was warranted.\nCircuit: that Amtrak was a strictly private entity and as such Congress was wrong in 2008 to set up a system that allowed it to issue regulations."}
