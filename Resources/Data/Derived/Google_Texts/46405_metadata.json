They won\u2019t be content until both patients and doctors are under their command.\n\nDemocrats won\u2019t say out loud in public that it\u2019s their goal to drive physicians under the government boot. But sometimes ambitions are revealed in unguarded moments.\n\nConsider the confession of a Democratic candidate running for the Virginia House of Delegates during the Great Falls Grange Debate on Nov. 1. According to reports, Kathleen Murphy, who lost the 34th District race to Republican incumbent Barbara Comstock, said she supported the idea of forcing doctors to accept Medicaid and Medicare patients against their will.\n\nYes, this is one Democrat running for a state office. But it\u2019s foolish to think her comment isn\u2019t in line with her party.\n\nA few years ago Massachusetts Democrats were behind a bill in the state legislature that would strip doctors who didn\u2019t accept Medicare, Medicaid and the state plan of their licenses to practice.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a political molehill. If doctors can be forced to participate in a government payment system they don\u2019t want to be in, then doctors are owned by government. Their education, labor and intellects will have been seized by the state. They are no longer free agents \u2014 they are serfs, the bondsmen of legislators who will sweat them like galley slaves.\n\nRoughly a fourth of physicians across the country already don\u2019t take Medicaid. About 10% to 12% don\u2019t participate in Medicare. Here\u2019s why: Government plans don\u2019t pay well.\n\nAccording to the Office of the Actuary for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, doctors are reimbursed by Medicare at a rate of about 80% of what private insurance pays, while Medicaid pays them only about 58% of what private coverage will take care of.\n\n\u201cPhysicians say they just can\u2019t afford to be part of a system that generates so many patients for so little compensation,\u201d says, Richard Jackson, chairman and CEO of Jackson Healthcare, a medical staffing and technology solutions company that has surveyed doctors.\n\nFour years ago, our IBD/TIPP Poll found that 45% doctors said they \u201cwould consider leaving their practice or taking an early retirement\u201d if the Democrats\u2019 health care overhaul became law.\n\nHow many more would leave if Washington required them to accept Medicare and Medicaid? How many brilliant students would choose other professions? No one wants, or deserves to be, chattel of the state.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Serfdom: Don't think that ObamaCare is the Democrats' last word on health care.
