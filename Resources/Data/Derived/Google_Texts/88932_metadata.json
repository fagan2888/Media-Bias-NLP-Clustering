The Senate HELP Committee on Wednesday will consider the legislation as part of its package of medical innovation bills, the counterpart to the House\u2019s 21st Century Cures Act.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n... MEDTECH generally keeps FDA out of the business of regulating software such as FitBits, EHRs and analytics, unless the software is intended to interpret or analyze clinical information without the mediation of a doctor or other expert. Health tech companies sought the law to set clear boundaries around FDA\u2019s involvement in the growing world of health technology.\n\n\u2014 But the new version of MEDTECH, sponsored by Sens. Michael Bennet and Orrin Hatch, allows some exceptions to that rule; it\u2019s a kind of emergency backdoor for FDA should ostensibly safe software turn out to pose dangers. The new language makes the FDA jump through a number of hoops if it wants to reassert its authority, however. The agency must publish a notice in the Federal Register stating the rationale for wanting to regulate a device and give 30 days for public comment. FDA must base its judgement on the likelihood and severity of patient harm, the extent to which the software supports clinical judgement, and how likely it is for a provider to review the information or recommendation provided by the software. The latest version of the bill: http://politico.pro/1TFP8FC\n\nHELP RELEASES MENTAL HEALTH DRAFT: A draft of a bipartisan mental health bill released late Monday would create of a model training program of authorized disclourse of patient records under HIPAA. The 114-page bill, which is set to be marked up by the Senate HELP Committee on March 16, would also mandate a study of 42 CFR Part 2, the federal law that requires patients sign off on every provider who can view their drug and alcohol abuse treatment records. Telemedicine would received grants for child psychiatry through the Health Resources and Services Administration. The legislation was crafted by Chairman Lamar Alexander and ranking member Sen. Patty Murray. The bill: http://1.usa.gov/1LNHshz\n\nDEBATE ENDS ON CARA: Senators on Monday voted 86-3 to end debate on the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act (S. 524). The bill seeks to address the nation\u2019s opioid epidemic in a number of ways including by supporting prescription drug monitoring programs. A final vote is expected either today or Wednesday.\n\neHealth tweet of the day: @SusannahFox: Help use data to change our understanding of the healthcare system to drive better decision making for #rheum http://bit.ly/1OXAiSk\n\nWelcome to Monday morning eHealth where we are carefully avoiding House of Cards spoilers as we work our way through season 4.

The state\u2019s largest Medicaid provider, the University of Mississippi Medical Center, can now view the longitudinal record of patients in its EHR without having to check a separate IT system. About a third of the state\u2019s residents are in Medicaid. The work was part of the state\u2019s three-year, $10 million contract with MedeAnalytics. (We profiled their work for providers here in 2014.) The state hopes to have data next year showing outcomes from its data-sharing efforts.\n\n\n\nWELCOME TO THE SHOW: A new ONC advisory committee \u2013 that on interoperability experience \u2013 will meet for the first time this afternoon. The goal is to develop and recommend policies that \u201cimprove the interoperability experience for providers and patients.\u201d Background: http://bit.ly/1ppudtq\n\nMIND THE GAP: An analysis of clinicians\u2019 notes accompanying prescriptions showed that the free-text writing is often used inappropriately. This suggests the need for better pre-release usability testing, training and feedback, and rigorous post-marketing evaluation of EHR software, according to researchers at Surescripts and Baylor College of Medicine. The study sample contained 26,341 new e-prescriptions transmitted to community pharmacies across the United States during one week in November 2013 by community-based prescribers using 492 different EHRs or e-prescribing software applications. More than two thirds contained inappropriate content, the study found. Such notes can create confusion, disrupt workflow and raise the potential of patient harm, according to the study.

Four-fifths of the physicians surveyed \u2014 they were drawn from the Medical Group Management Association \u2014 said their reporting requirements are worse than they were three years ago. Three-fourths said the quality measures weren\u2019t clinically relevant. \u201cThis study proves that the current top-down approach has failed. It serves no purpose to have over three thousand competing measures of quality across government and private initiatives,\u201d MGMA CEO Halee Fischer-Wright said. The study: http://bit.ly/1QFw2yk\n\n\n\nHOW TO BRING LAGGARDS ALONG: Federal health IT officials and researchers need to determine which EHR functions are germane to hospitals ineligible for meaningful use -- rehab, psychiatric and long-term care facilities \u2014 in order to make buying expensive EHRs more worthwhile. \u201cExisting hospital meaningful-use criterial were designed based on the care provided in acute care settings,\u201d researchers wrote in the latest issue of Health Affairs. \u201cVendors have created EHR systems that meet those criteria.\u201d Despite a surge in EHR adoption between 2009 and 2013, the ineligible hospitals lag significantly behind traditional acute care hospitals in health IT use.

OCR plans around 200 \u201cdesk audits\u201d and between 10 and 25 full-scale audits, McGraw said. McGraw added that OCR plans to expand guidance regarding patients\u2019 rights to access their medical information.

This particular project is unique in that it will use private, de-identified administrative claims along with clinical data from patients\u2019 electronic records. Up to $40,000 in prizes will be awarded by Optum, Academy Health and HHS.

Rick Snyder in light of its decision last week in Gobeille v. Liberty Mutual Insurance Co. That decision limits states' abilities to collect claims for their all-payer databases from self-funded insurance plans that are governed by federal ERISA law. A group representing self-funded insurance plans in Michigan had sued Snyder over a law that taxed health care claims and required plans, including the self-insured, to file certain records. District and appeals courts rejected the suit, but SCOTUS is now asking them to revisit - highlighting that its Gobeille decision will have impact beyond the claims databases at the center of that case. The request: http://1.usa.gov/1OXGbPC\n\nTHAT WHOLE ICD-10 DISRUPTION ISSUE: While more than 60 percent of doctors surveyed by the social networking site SERMO said ICD-10 implementation slowed their work down, three-quarters said they are back to the way they were before ICD-10. Only 37 percent said ICD-10 implementation was more difficult than anticipated. \"It did slow me down. I spent a lot of time writing out codes I would need. Some did not work,\u201d one cardiologist told the site. \u201cI think I have it down now. Having an EHR that is good at this helps.\"\n\nNOW AVAILABLE: HARD TO ACCESS CAMPAIGN DETAILS \u2014 POLITICO Pro, POLITICO\u2019s premium solution for policy professionals offers Campaign Pro.
