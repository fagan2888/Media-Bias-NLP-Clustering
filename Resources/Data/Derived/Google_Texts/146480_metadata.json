After two brutal battles with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, Dr. Marjorie Lokich simply decided that a positive outlook was crucial to keep the cancer at bay. Happily, her wry sense of humor remained very much intact, and her chiropractic patients enjoyed uncommonly personal--and personable--care in her practice on Riverside Avenue.\n\nAs a sounding board, counselor, and occasional drill sergeant, Marje helped me immeasurably over the years. When I wanted to produce a \u201cman on the street\u201d radio segment, she accompanied me to the Minnesota State Fair with strict instructions not to let me chicken out. After an hour or two of appeasement, she removed one of her crystal earrings and held it over my head, dancing and chanting on the crowded midway. She explained that on her honeymoon, these earrings prevented her from getting seasick on a fishing excursion, so she was giving me the \u201cfish whammy.\u201d Suddenly desperate, I reached out blindly and scored my first subject: a Canadian Romanian-folk-dance choreographer who took credit for Gretzky's slapshot. Proof that my radio concept was valid, and that I should always check for jewelry before being seen in public with Marje.\n\nShortly after Thanksgiving, Marje required a tracheotomy. I never got good at reading her lips, so we played classic TV themes on YouTube and she mouthed the words. So it is that after a lifetime of conversations lasting untold hours, her last words to me were the lyrics to \"My Mother the Car.\" Random and cheesy, but they end with this gem:\n\n\"'Cause she helps me through everything I do, and I'm so glad she's near.\"\n\nShe did, and I am. Marje always did work with what she got.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "In the early 90s, my friend Marje made a heartfelt decision to approach life mindfully, with an attitude of service.", "title": "Northern Lights 2014: Dr. Marjorie Lokich, humor in the service of life", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/northern-lights-2014-dr-marjorie-lokich-humor-in-the-service-of-life/286763951/", "image": {"url": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/Northern+Lights_marje-lokich_1419423059627.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "width": 1200, "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/Northern+Lights_marje-lokich_1419423059627.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "twitter": {"description": "In the early 90s, my friend Marje made a heartfelt decision to approach life mindfully, with an attitude of service.", "title": "Northern Lights 2014: Dr. Marjorie Lokich, humor in the service of life", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/northern-lights-2014-dr-marjorie-lokich-humor-in-the-service-of-life/286763951/", "image": {"src": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/Northern+Lights_marje-lokich_1419423059627.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/Northern+Lights_marje-lokich_1419423059627.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "description": "In the early 90s, my friend Marje made a heartfelt decision to approach life mindfully, with an attitude of service."}, "article_summary": "In the early 90s, my friend Marje made a heartfelt decision to approach life mindfully, with an attitude of service.\nAfter two brutal battles with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, Dr. Marjorie Lokich simply decided that a positive outlook was crucial to keep the cancer at bay.\nHappily, her wry sense of humor remained very much intact, and her chiropractic patients enjoyed uncommonly personal--and personable--care in her practice on Riverside Avenue.\nProof that my radio concept was valid, and that I should always check for jewelry before being seen in public with Marje.\nI never got good at reading her lips, so we played classic TV themes on YouTube and she mouthed the words."}
