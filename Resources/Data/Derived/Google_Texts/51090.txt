Daniel St. Hubert on June 6. Kevin Hagen for The Wall Street Journal

The man charged with stabbing a 6-year-old boy to death in a Brooklyn public housing development elevator tried to speak at a court appearance Wednesday, but was rebuffed by the judge.

“Your honor, your honor, is it all right if I have a moment with the court please—a short moment?” said Daniel St. Hubert, who has been charged with killing Prince Joshua Avitto Prince Joshua Avitto and stabbing 7-year-old Mikayla Capers.

A woman in the gallery in the courtroom shouted “no!” and Brooklyn Criminal Court Judge Matthew Sciarrino Jr. said, “no sir.”

Mr. St. Hubert was cuffed, with his hands behind his back, and wearing an orange Department of Correction jumpsuit.

“Remand will continue; case will be adjourned and transferred to the supreme court,” Mr. Sciarrino Jr. added as the defendant was led out of the courtroom.

Assistant District Attorney Patrick L. O’Connor said a grand jury indicted Mr. St. Hurbert on Tuesday, charging him with murder in the second degree and other crimes.

Mr. St. Hurbert’s attorney, Edward Friedman, said after court that he didn’t expect the outburst.

“I have no idea what he was trying to say. I told him to be quiet, don’t say anything,” he said. “I wasn’t expecting that but I wasn’t totally surprised.”

He said Mr. St. Hubert is behind held at the Bellevue Hospital ward and that his visited the defendant there.

Also in court was Prince’s father, Nicholas Avitto, accompanied by his brother Scott Avitto.

Mr. Avitto, who said he was on this way to a meeting with the District Attorney’s office, said it felt “terrible” to see the man accused of killing his son.

“I actually saw him personally for the first time today,” he said.
