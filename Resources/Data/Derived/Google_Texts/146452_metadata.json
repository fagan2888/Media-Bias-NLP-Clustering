Anthony \u201cCat\u201d Barber posed with fans taking selfies amid the chaos.\n\nThe Wolfpack had turned No. 2 Duke\u2019s latest visit to Raleigh into yet another party \u2014 complete with ending the Blue Devils\u2019 unbeaten start.\n\nTrevor Lacey scored 21 points and N.C. State shot 55 percent to beat Duke 87-75 on Sunday, knocking off one of the last three undefeated teams in the country.\n\n\u201cToday we just all put it together and we just played as a team,\u201d Lacey said. \u201cWhen we play like this, we\u2019re a good team.\u201d\n\nN.C. State (12-5, 3-1 ACC) knocked down shots all day \u2014 some wide open after defensive breakdowns \u2014 and made 10 of 16 3-pointers. Defensively, the Wolfpack ran constant double teams at preseason All-American Jahlil Okafor to slow Duke\u2019s big man.\n\nThe Wolfpack dominated a second-half stretch with seven consecutive scoring possessions to build a 19-point lead \u2014 Duke\u2019s biggest deficit all season by far \u2014 then turned away the Blue Devils\u2019 late comeback.\n\nIt marked the second time in three seasons that an unbeaten Duke team visited Raleigh and headed to the locker room as the rowdy home crowd stormed the court to celebrate afterward.\n\nThe Blue Devils (14-1, 2-1) were No. 1 and 15-0 when it happened two years ago. Now top-ranked Kentucky and No. 3 Virginia are the nation\u2019s last unbeatens.\n\n\u201cWere we as tough as we needed to be? No,\u201d coach Mike Krzyzewski said. \u201cDoes that mean we\u2019re soft? No. We\u2019re a good team. We need to learn to play at that level. You\u2019ve got to be in these things to learn it.\u201d\n\nOkafor finished with 23 points and 12 rebounds, but the Blue Devils shot 37 percent and just couldn\u2019t keep up when N.C. State\u2019s offense got rolling.\n\nRalston Turner scored 11 of his 16 points after halftime, including two straight 3s to break open a tie game. And BeeJay Anya added a career-high 14 points to lead a strong effort from the Wolfpack\u2019s big men, whose development has been a big focus of Mark Gottfried\u2019s staff.\n\n\u201cWe got the ball inside and our big guys were productive,\u201d Gottfried said. \u201cI think any time with any team \u2026 the more productive guys are around the basket, it opens everything up on the perimeter.\u201d\n\nQuinn Cook scored 18 points for Duke, which missed 20 of 27 3-pointers and couldn\u2019t make it through a pair of instate ACC road games unscathed this week. The Blue Devils had a tougher-than-expected win at Wake Forest on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThese two games just taught us that we can lose,\u201d sophomore Matt Jones said, \u201cif we don\u2019t bring our game every day.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Trevor Lacey scored 21 points and N.C.
