Six people were transported to local hospitals Sunday evening after a two-SUV collision in central Topeka, an official with the Topeka Police Department said.

Lt. Chuck Haggard said the injuries — all coded yellow — weren’t believed to be life-threatening.

First responders received the call at 7:09 p.m. Sunday to the wreck at S.W. 21st and Lincoln, just east of Washburn University.

The accident, a wreck involving a white Ford Explorer and a black Chevrolet Tahoe, disabled both vehicles at the northwest corner of the intersection near the curb.

The original report said at least one individual was seriously injured, but that was downgraded.

At least one individual needed a stretcher after being treated on the ground near the collision.

It was clear how many were taken via American Medical Response ambulance, but several were on scene.

“Everybody got transported, so they needed some level of treatment,” Haggard said.

Sexes and ages of the six people were unknown, but it was believed that two of the injured came from the Tahoe and four from the Explorer.

As of 8:45 p.m. Sunday, Topeka police were still determining how the accident happened. Though they were able to confirm the Explorer was headed west on S.W. 21st at the time of the accident, it was unclear in which direction the Tahoe was traveling.

“We don’t know if the (Tahoe) turned out in front of him, or he could’ve come out from the lot,” Haggard said of the shopping center parking lot at the southwest corner of the intersection. “We’re still trying to get it figured out.”

A few blocks of westbound S.W. 21st were closed to traffic during the investigation, and one lane eastbound was closed.
