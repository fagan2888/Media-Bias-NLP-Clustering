You know, one of the parts of that 50-pound document no one read before passing it. And undoubtedly have still not read.\n\n\n\nIt is discrimination to refuse breast implant surgery, hormone therapy and sex change surgery for gender transition. Individuals must be treated consistent with their gender identity including access to facilities. On and on it goes.\n\n\n\nHHS Secretary Sylvia Burwell is thrilled. Finally, she says, a civil rights law that doesn't discriminate on the basis of sex. They do have a gender of course. It's the one God Himself assigned them at their birth. And to equate such things as gender reassignment surgery to civil rights is just crazy.\n\n\n\nWe are going at break neck speed ... in the wrong direction ... and in nearly every area. Remember when we used to think Sodom and Gomorrah were sinful?\n\n\n\nAnd again, if you take a good look, most of Obama's \"directives\" are illegal but he gets away with it anyway.\n\n\n\nLinda Athens\n\n\n\nKingman\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "News and Information in Mohave County including Kingman, Golden Valley, Chloride, Dolan Springs, Arizona, AZ", "GENERATOR": "1up!
