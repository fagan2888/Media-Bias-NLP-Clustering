Ruiz says that he\u2019s leaning towards Hillary Clinton, but wants to hear more from candidates on healthcare, the minimum wage, and immigration. Latin Times / Cedar Attanasio\n\nLas Vegas, Nevada \u2014 Want to know who won the Democratic debate on Tuesday? Then don\u2019t ask Latino union organizer and pediatric nurse Sam Ruiz. A Colombian immigrant and a leader of his SEIU-affiliated local in Miami, Florida, Ruiz watched the debate but came away with more questions than answers. Take the minimum wage increase, which he and the SEIU are fighting for nationwide.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t hear any specifics from any of them last night,\u201d Ruiz tells the Latin Times on Wednesday in a cafe outside the Flamingo, a few casinos down the Las Vegas strip from the Wynn where the Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, Martin O\u2019Malley, Lincoln Chafee and Jim Webb debated on Tuesday.\n\nBorn and raised in Colombia, Ruiz moved to the U.S. in 1979 and now works at the Miami Jackson Memorial hospital where his current title is \u201cPediatric Transport Coordinator, Vascular Access Specialist.\u201d\n\nIn practice, that means overseeing the evacuation of babies and children around the U.S. and across Latin America and the Caribbean, bringing them by airplane, helicopter, and ground ambulance.\n\n\u201cYou meet parents in the middle of the night, and you rescue their babies. It\u2019s a strong bond -- one couple I have kept in touch with for 14 years,\u201d Ruiz says. \u201cWe go the the Bahamas a lot.\u201d\n\nInternational cases take Ruiz back to Colombia sometimes, where he once picked up a pair of prematurely born twins, whose little hearts needed an operation that couldn\u2019t be done at the local hospital.\n\nRuiz was in Las Vegas by chance. The SEIU Nurse Alliance scheduled their events far before the Democratic debate was announced, and organizers say that they actually had to shuffle their schedule to make time for participants of the 2015 conference to watch it live.\n\nWho Will Nurses Endorse?\n\nRuiz was not the only nurse in town during the Democratic debate and the SEIU Nurse Alliance not the only union. National Nurses United demonstrated on Tuesday night in support of Bernie Sanders, who the group endorsed in August.\n\nThe SEIU hasn\u2019t endorsed a candidate and didn\u2019t endorse a democrat in the 2008 until after the primaries. Ruiz isn\u2019t ready to call for a vote at his local, but he does have a favorite.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m partial to Hillary,\u201d he says, but adds that he and other nurses \u201care watching everyone.\u201d\n\nTake health care. Bernie Sanders has won the hearts of many nurse by promising to pursue a single-payer system that would replace the subsidies and health insurance mandate Obamacare with a nationalized health system resembling that of most other industrialized nations.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re even looking at single-payer. We have a winning situation [with Obamacare]. We have to make it easier to enroll, we need to eliminate the gaps,\u201d says, adding that \u201cHillary has said she's willing to help lower out-of-pocket expenses.\u201d\n\nNational Nurses United communications director Chuck Idelson strongly disagrees, arguing that Hillary\u2019s plan is not enough.\n\n\u201cThe \u2018winning situation\u2019 with Obamacare leaves 33 million people without any health coverage. As Bernie Sanders has emphasized, the failure to guarantee health care as a human right [...] is a moral disgrace. His plan [...] is the only way to end this unconscionable nightmare,\u201d Idelson told the Latin Times in a phone interview.\n\nImmigrants Still Booted Off Obamacare\n\nRuiz\u2019s sister knows what it\u2019s like to be one of those without healthcare. As a legal permanent resident, she is eligible for Obamacare, but Ruiz says that she overestimated her income and when her tax credits were reduced as a result, she chose not to continue her health plan because the premium cost was too much for her to afford.\n\nOther immigrants have faced different but equally devastating bureaucratic nightmares. Remember how much trouble the Obamacare had getting off the ground? The website failings and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services? For immigrants, the website has never been fixed.\n\nAn estimated half-million immigrants have been booted off of Obamacare, according to the National Immigration Law Center \u201cdue to unresolved immigration status or citizenship inconsistencies,\u201d including 212,000 last year and 430,000 so far in 2015.\n\nAgain, that\u2019s not exactly the same problem experienced by Ruiz\u2019s sister. In fact, it\u2019s possible that the majority of the applicants struggling to complete the paperwork are naturalized U.S. citizens like Ruiz himself, according to NILC Health Policy Analyst Angel Padilla.\n\n\u201cHHS really prioritized making the system work for American-born citizens between [the first and second open enrollment periods], they did not do enough to make it work for immigrants,\u201d Padilla says, adding that \u201cthere are still a lot of unanswered questions.\u201d\n\nFor example, HHS has not provided figures about the national origins of these immigrants, or what part of the U.S. they are concentrated in. So the NILC doesn\u2019t know in which states or in what languages it can best help those who are trying to apply.\n\nPower Of The Latino Vote\n\nWhatever candidate addresses the issues affecting Latino voters will find a friend in Ruiz, who says that his communities -- nurses, unions and Latinos -- will take a leading role in deciding who wins in 2016. Of course, they would still have to vote. Around 50 percent of American adults don\u2019t vote. For Latinos, the rate is even lower.\n\n\u201cWe Latinos have the power to make a difference on election day. If we can get every single one of them to vote, we can put down or put up a president.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.latintimes.com/sites/latintimes.com/themes/lt/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "hillary clinton, bernie sanders, latino voters, seiu, national nurses united, democratic debates 2015, hillary clinton 2016, bernie sanders 2016", "og": {"site_name": "Latin Times", "description": "This Latino union leader and nurse has pleanty to say about the Democratic debates, and how it relates to the national conversation about health care, immigration, and the fight for raising the minimum wage -- even if Democrats do not.", "title": "Who Won The Democratic Debate?
