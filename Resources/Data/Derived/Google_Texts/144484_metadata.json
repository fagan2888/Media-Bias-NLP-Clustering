A total of 38 stakes races in the three categories are scheduled to be contested over the 39 days, including the $100,000 Arapahoe Park Classic for thoroughbreds Aug. 16.\n\nSo despite the resounding November defeat of a ballot measure, Amendment 68, that essentially would have turned the facility into a full-scale casino with racing as a sidelight, it is business and racing as usual for 2015 at Arapahoe Park. And the Colorado horse racing community is optimistic enough to take the stand that it\u2019s not naive to add \u201c\u2026 and beyond.\u201d\n\n\u201cFrom a horseman\u2019s perspective and our perspective and management\u2019s perspective, we\u2019re doing great,\u201d Powers said. \u201cWe\u2019re certainly self-sufficient. We more than make enough money to exist.\u201d\n\nThe track\u2019s owner, Twin River Worldwide Holdings Inc., is based in Rhode Island and operates a casino there, as often noted in the anti-Amendment 68 television ads that countered those arguing for passage.\n\nArapahoe Park\u2019s live race meeting is required by the state as a trade-off for allowing the company to conduct satellite wagering on races and other tracks at various outlets, its own or licensed. In recent years, the sometimes tense relationship between the Colorado horsemen and the track has evolved into an \u201cin it together\u201d co-existence. Bolstered by casino-type wagering, New Mexico tracks offer higher purses, but Arapahoe Park has found a niche, especially for Colorado-bred horses with bonus money going to breeders.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been here since 1995, and there have been three or four times we\u2019ve tried to pass something to get alternative gaming of some kind here,\u201d Powers said. \u201cIt\u2019s never passed before, so from a horseman\u2019s perspective, it\u2019s almost like crying wolf. We have tried before and probably thought we were going to get something passed and never did, and we kept right on running.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve always tried to assure the horsemen every time we\u2019ve put forth some legislation or whatever, \u2018Hey, we\u2019re going to keep going. We\u2019re just trying to get better, and we wouldn\u2019t be doing our due diligence if we weren\u2019t.\u2019 There\u2019s no doubt that alternative gaming has been the answer for a lot of places to be successful. \u2026 So, no, I haven\u2019t gotten a lot of, \u2018Aw, you\u2019re not going to run now.\u2019 I get a little of that every year. There are certain people who are doomsday people. But they\u2019re not people in the know. I\u2019m the one that sends out the stall apps, I\u2019m the one going over the horses applying, and it should be as good a year as we\u2019ve had lately.\u201d\n\nShannon Rushton of Holly is the son of one of the state\u2019s top owner-trainers, Temple Rushton, and was at the track last week in his role as executive director of the Colorado Horse Racing Association, along with the Colorado Thoroughbred Breeders Association the major voice of the state\u2019s horse racing community.\n\nRushton said of the defeat of Amendment 68: \u201cWhen they didn\u2019t get that, there was some concern out there that maybe they\u2019re not in it for the long haul. But the folks from Rhode Island had assured us that they\u2019re in to stay and they want to be a viable partner in the community out here. They\u2019ve proven to us that they want to do that. So a lot of those concerns went away.\u201d\n\nThe defeat of the measure was expected for weeks.\n\n\u201cWithin 24 hours after the vote failed, they had us on the phone telling us that same thing \u2014 \u2018We\u2019re not going anywhere, we\u2019re going to be right there, the horsemen can have faith in us,\u2019 \u201d Rushton said.\n\nRushton said reassurance came from Bruce Seymore, the head of the track\u2019s official parent company, Mile High Racing, plus from representatives of Twin Rivers, in a conference call.\n\n\u201cThey also had flown a couple of us back to their casino in Rhode Island and at that point, they told us, \u2018Win, lose or draw in this thing, we\u2019re not going away,\u2019 \u201d Rushton said.\n\nFor how long?\n\n\u201cThey just said that as long as this continues to be a viable property, they were staying,\u201d Rushton said. \u201cAs long as people were going to be interested in the racetrack, they were going to be in the racetrack business.\u201d\n\nLinda Wood owns the 220-acre Menoken Farms in Montrose and is the state\u2019s top dedicated thoroughbred breeder. She doesn\u2019t train or own horses running at the track, but breeds and sells, while still following their racing as the breeder of record.\n\n\u201cI think everybody was looking forward to the amendment passing and when it didn\u2019t, yes, there was a lot of concern,\u201d Wood said. \u201cBut they reassured everyone that they were coming back. The question is for how long and what\u2019s going to happen next. I don\u2019t have those answers, but I believe the management is still trying to reassure people that they want to go forward and progress.\u201d\n\nWood added, \u201cI was pretty worried. I\u2019m still worried. I have pastures full of Colorado-breds. \u2026 So if something happens to the racetrack, it\u2019ll be catastrophic for me. There\u2019s always the hope that if it closed, we could come back bigger and better. I\u2019ve always thought it could be a huge success here in Colorado.\u201d\n\nTerry Frei: tfrei@denverpost.com or twitter.com/TFrei", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Arapahoe Park likely to succeed without funding from casinos", "title": "Arapahoe Park likely to succeed without funding from casinos", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/05/09/arapahoe-park-likely-to-succeed-without-funding-from-casinos/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150509__20150510_C3_SP10HORSEARAPAHOEp1.jpg", "height": 440}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150509__20150510_C3_SP10HORSEARAPAHOEp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-09T21:54:39+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-24T15:27:24+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "And the Colorado horse racing community is optimistic enough to take the stand that it\u2019s not naive to add \u201c\u2026 and beyond.\u201d\u201cFrom a horseman\u2019s perspective and our perspective and management\u2019s perspective, we\u2019re doing great,\u201d Powers said.\nBolstered by casino-type wagering, New Mexico tracks offer higher purses, but Arapahoe Park has found a niche, especially for Colorado-bred horses with bonus money going to breeders.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve always tried to assure the horsemen every time we\u2019ve put forth some legislation or whatever, \u2018Hey, we\u2019re going to keep going.\n\u201cThey just said that as long as this continues to be a viable property, they were staying,\u201d Rushton said.\nA total of 38 stakes races in the three categories are scheduled to be contested over the 39 days, including the $100,000 Arapahoe Park Classic for thoroughbreds Aug. 16."}
