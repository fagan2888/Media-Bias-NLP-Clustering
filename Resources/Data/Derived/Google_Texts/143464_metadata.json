Ted Cruz of Texas has recently become a lightning rod on both sides of the political aisle for his adamant opposition to issues like Obamacare and illegal immigration.\n\nBut his strong policies and political beliefs are not the only thing he\u2019s getting needled about this week. GQ Magazine published a harsh profile of the Cuban-American that take a dig at the senator about everything from his at Harvard to his ego to his choose of footwear (ostrich cowboy boots).\n\n\u201cAs a law student at Harvard, he refused to study with anyone who hadn't been an undergrad at Harvard, Princeton, or Yale,\u201d wrote Jason Zengerle in his article entitled \u2018Ted Cruz: This Distinguished Wacko Bird from Texas.\u2019 \u201cSays Damon Watson, one of Cruz's law-school roommates: \u2018He said he didn't want anybody from 'minor Ivies' like Penn or Brown.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe \u2018wacko bird\u2019 line comes from Arizona Sen. John McCain, who used it to refer Cruz when the Tea Party senator joined Kentucky Rand Paul\u2019s filibuster of John Brennan\u2019s nomination to the head of the CIA as an act of protest against the drone program used by the Obama administration.\n\nThe profile paints a different picture from the one that Cruz is trying to publicly maintain \u2013 that of a down-home Texan. Instead, Zengerle portrays the Texas senator as a calculating \u201cTea Party intellectual\u201d who has divided the Republican Party between those who see him a young politician who has overstepped his bounds and those conservative leaders who see him as a potential presidential candidate in 2016.\n\n\u201cFor a party in the midst of some serious soul-searching, Cruz offers a simple, reassuring solution: Forget the blather about demographic tidal waves and pleas for modernization; all Republicans need to do is return to their small-government, anti-tax fundamentals,\u201d Zengerle wrote.\n\nCruz has been silent on the profile as he deals with the pending legislation surrounding a government shutdown.\n\nCruz said last week he was prepared to filibuster any legislation that restores money for the health care law, even if it meant a shutdown. In remarks on the Senate floor during the day, though, he appeared to soften his tone.\n\n\"We should not have a government shutdown and we should never, ever, ever even discuss a default on the debt,\" he said. The House is expected to approve legislation this week that permits the Treasury to borrow freely for a year \u2014 preventing a first-ever default \u2014 while delaying the health care law for a year.\n\nEarlier in the day, Cruz's battle to deny funding for the nation's three-year-old health care law got off to a shaky start when he first blocked action on unrelated items on the agenda, then quickly backed off.\n\n\"There will be time\" later in the week to debate the health care issue, he told reporters as he left the Senate floor.\n\nTed Cruz\u2019s press office did not immediately have a comment regarding the profile.\n\nFollow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatino\n\nLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino", "article_metadata": {"classification": "POLITICS/US Congress", "dcterms.modified": "2013-09-24 13:52:25 EDT", "dcterms.abstract": "GQ Magazine published a harsh profile of the Cuban-American that take a dig at the senator about everything from his at Harvard to his ego to his choose of footwear (ostrich cowboy boots).", "twitter": {"image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/global.fncstatic.com/static/managed/img/fn-latino/politics/0/0/Ted%20Cruz%20Obama%20Federal%20Power.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "site": "@foxnewslatino", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@foxnewslatino"}, "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.publisher": "Fox News Latino", "parsely-metadata": "{\"title\":\"Ted Cruz Called Snobby Ivy Leaguer, Wacko Bird from Texas In GQ Profile\",\"link\":\"http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/politics/2013/09/24/ted-cruz-called-snobby-ivy-leaguer-in-article-in-gq-magazine/\",\"image_url\":\"http://a57.foxnews.com/global.fncstatic.com/static/managed/img/fn-latino/politics/0/0/Ted%20Cruz%20Obama%20Federal%20Power.jpg?ve=1&tl=1\",\"type\":\"article\",\"identifier\":\"c0cb4750f0151410VgnVCM100000d7c1a8c0RCRD\",\"section\":\"politics\",\"pub_date\":\"2013-09-24T17:52:25Z\",\"tags\":[\"POLITICS/US Congress\"]}", "prism.aggregationType": "front", "keywords": "John McCain,Ted Cruz,GQ,John Brennan,presidential candidate,Rand Paul,CIA,health care law,government shutdown", "prism.channel": "fnl", "dc.description": "GQ Magazine published a harsh profile of the Cuban-American that take a dig at the senator about everything from his at Harvard to his ego to his choose of footwear (ostrich cowboy boots).", "dc.identifier": "urn:uuid:c0cb4750f0151410VgnVCM100000d7c1a8c0RCRD", "pagetype": "article", "dc.subject": "John McCain,Ted Cruz,GQ,John Brennan,presidential candidate,Rand Paul,CIA,health care law,government shutdown", "classification-isa": "congress", "description": "Si a\u00fan no est\u00e1s convencido de que los crossovers han llegado aqu\u00ed para quedarse, te daremos una prueba m\u00e1s: un informe reciente dice que, debido a sus bajas ventas, el Lexus CT lenta ser\u00e1...", "prism.section": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 155493694485141}, "dc.source": "Fox News Latino", "dc.language": "en-US", "dc.title": "Ted Cruz Called Snobby Ivy Leaguer, Wacko Bird from Texas In GQ Profile", "dcterms.created": "2013-09-24 13:52:25 EDT", "og": {"site_name": "Fox News Latino", "description": "GQ magazine released a profile of the Cuban-American senator that\u2019s dig at everything from Cruz\u2019s time at Harvard to his ego and his choose of footwear.", "title": "Ted Cruz Called Snobby Ivy Leaguer, Wacko Bird from Texas In GQ Profile", "url": "http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/politics/2013/09/24/ted-cruz-called-snobby-ivy-leaguer-in-article-in-gq-magazine/", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/global.fncstatic.com/static/managed/img/fn-latino/politics/0/0/Ted%20Cruz%20Obama%20Federal%20Power.jpg", "type": "article"}, "dc.type": "Text.Article", "dc.date": "2013-09-24", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"Ted Cruz Called Snobby Ivy Leaguer, Wacko Bird from Texas In GQ Profile\",\"link\":\"http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/politics/2013/09/24/ted-cruz-called-snobby-ivy-leaguer-in-article-in-gq-magazine/\",\"image_url\":\"http://a57.foxnews.com/global.fncstatic.com/static/managed/img/fn-latino/politics/0/0/Ted%20Cruz%20Obama%20Federal%20Power.jpg?ve=1&tl=1\",\"type\":\"article\",\"post_id\":\"c0cb4750f0151410VgnVCM100000d7c1a8c0RCRD\",\"section\":\"politics\",\"pub_date\":\"2013-09-24T17:52:25Z\",\"tags\":[\"POLITICS/US Congress\"]}"}, "article_summary": "Cruz said last week he was prepared to filibuster any legislation that restores money for the health care law, even if it meant a shutdown.\n\"There will be time\" later in the week to debate the health care issue, he told reporters as he left the Senate floor.\nThe profile paints a different picture from the one that Cruz is trying to publicly maintain \u2013 that of a down-home Texan.\nCruz has been silent on the profile as he deals with the pending legislation surrounding a government shutdown.\nFreshman U.S. Sen.
