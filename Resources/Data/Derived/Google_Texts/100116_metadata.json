(WSAZ) -- You've seen them a lot lately during commercial breaks on TV, and Tuesday night you could see them on the same stage.\n\nElection Day is three weeks away. One of the hotly contested races in our region is the 3rd District Congressional race in West Virginia between Democratic incumbent Nick Rahall, seeking his 20th term, and Republican State Sen. Evan Jenkins.\n\nThe two participated in a debate at the Pullman Plaza Hotel. The discussion covered a variety of issues including coal mining, healthcare and foreign affairs.\n\nBoth accused each other of not being truly supportive of the coal industry.\n\n\"You can not be pro coal and vote for Nancy Pelosi for speaker six times who wants to kill coal,\u201d Jenkins said. \u201cThese policies are devastating to our coal industry.\"\n\n\"Look who the big backers of his campaign are,\u201d Rahall said. \u201cDon Blankenship, the Koch brothers, each one and their wives have personally maxed out to him. Follow the money. That will tell you what side he's on.\u201d\n\nJenkins criticized Rahall for his support of the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\"Our healthcare system is broken,\u201d Jenkins said. \u201cWe need a true healthcare system that actually does promote access. (Obamacare) has raised prices on small businesses. It has caused coverage to decrease.\u201d\n\nRahall defended elements of the Affordable Care Act, but also said he\u2019s voted to change parts of it.\n\n\"I've voted numerous times to tweak it and make the amendments necessary,\u201d Rahall said. \u201cIt's time we put politics aside on this and make it work for the American people.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "The discussion at the Pullman Plaza Hotel in downtown Huntington covered a variety of issues including coal mining, healthcare and foreign affairs.", "language": "english", "author": "Andrew Colegrove", "og": {"url": "http://www.wsaz.com/home/headlines/Jenkins-and-Rahall-Square-Off-in-Debate-279232742.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/560*315/DebateEvansRahallSMALL.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The discussion at the Pullman Plaza Hotel in downtown Huntington covered a variety of issues including coal mining, healthcare and foreign affairs.", "title": "Jenkins and Rahall Square Off in Debate for U.S. House"}, "twitter": {"description": "The discussion at the Pullman Plaza Hotel in downtown Huntington covered a variety of issues including coal mining, healthcare and foreign affairs.", "title": "Jenkins and Rahall Square Off in Debate for U.S. House", "url": "http://www.wsaz.com/home/headlines/Jenkins-and-Rahall-Square-Off-in-Debate-279232742.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/560*315/DebateEvansRahallSMALL.jpg", "creator": "@WSAZnews", "site": "@WSAZnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "Jenkins and Rahall Square Off in Debate for U.S. House", "fb": {"app_id": 589941277838654, "pages": 13220309701}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "google-site-verification": "rnQvGTE5yUwyFE9BUQbKDfpuwACWSv9dy_JXjEFO1WY", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Jenkins and Rahall Square Off, in Debate for US House"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1703\"", "article_summary": "\"You can not be pro coal and vote for Nancy Pelosi for speaker six times who wants to kill coal,\u201d Jenkins said.\nThat will tell you what side he's on.\u201dJenkins criticized Rahall for his support of the Affordable Care Act.\nIt has caused coverage to decrease.\u201dRahall defended elements of the Affordable Care Act, but also said he\u2019s voted to change parts of it.\n\"Our healthcare system is broken,\u201d Jenkins said.\n\u201cWe need a true healthcare system that actually does promote access."}
