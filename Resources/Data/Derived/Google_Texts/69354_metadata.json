The CBO estimated that such a significant increase in the minimum wage would cost the economy 500,000 jobs, perhaps as many as 1 million, over the next two years. \u201cMany of these jobs,\u201d the letter notes, \u201care held by entry-level workers with limited experience or vocational skills, the very employees meant to be helped.\u201d\n\nThe economists explain that the minimum wage is \u201ca poorly targeted anti-poverty measure,\u201d noting that [e]xtra earnings generated by such an increase in the minimum wage would not substantially help the poor,\u201d again pointing to the findings of the CBO report.\n\n\u201cAs CBO noted, \u2018many low-wage workers are not members of low-income families,\u2019\u201d the economists explain. \u201cIn fact, CBO estimates that less than 20 percent of the workers who would see a wage increase to $10.10 actually live in households that earn less than the federal poverty line.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor these reasons, we encourage federal policymakers to examine creative, comprehensive policy solutions that truly help address poverty, boost incomes from work, and increase upward mobility by fostering growth in our nation\u2019s economy,\u201d they added.\n\nThe Nobel Prize winning economists who signed the letter are Vernon Smith, Edward Prescott, and Eugene Fama. Other signers include Donald Boudreaux of George Washington University, Greg Mankiw of Havard University, and Glenn Hubbard of Columbia University.\n\nThe federal minimum wage hike proposal appears to be dead on arrival in Congress. President Obama and congressional Democrats have sought to make it a campaign issue, though media coverage has been drowned out in recent weeks by the ongoing Obamacare debacle and foreign policy issues.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) was recently forced to delay a vote on the minimum wage proposal because of a lack of support from his own caucus.\n\nH/T: Cafe Hayek", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Barack Obama,businesses,CBO,Democrats,Don Boudreaux,economists,Economy,Edward Prescott,entry-level workers,Eugene Fama,Greg Mankiw,Harry Reid,laureates,lawmakers,letter,minimum wage,Nobel Prize,Poverty,Vernon", "DC.Title": "Economists speak out against minimum wage increase", "robots": "index,follow", "copyright": "(c) 2005-2013 United Liberty", "description": "More than 500 economists, including three Nobel laureates, have signed a letter warning lawmakers of the &#8220;serious consequences&#8221; of raising the federal minimum wage to $10.10 an hour, a policy being pushed by President Barack Obama and"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fceeae\"", "article_summary": "Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) was recently forced to delay a vote on the minimum wage proposal because of a lack of support from his own caucus.\nThe federal minimum wage hike proposal appears to be dead on arrival in Congress.\nThe CBO estimated that such a significant increase in the minimum wage would cost the economy 500,000 jobs, perhaps as many as 1 million, over the next two years.\nThe Nobel Prize winning economists who signed the letter are Vernon Smith, Edward Prescott, and Eugene Fama.\nOther signers include Donald Boudreaux of George Washington University, Greg Mankiw of Havard University, and Glenn Hubbard of Columbia University."}
