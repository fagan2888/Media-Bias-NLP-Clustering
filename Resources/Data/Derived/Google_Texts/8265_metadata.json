House Speaker John A. Boehner proved unable to gather enough votes from his own majority, many of whom sought deeper cuts to government spending and wanted to use the budget process to curb Obama's polices on immigration and healthcare.\n\nBoehner hoped Democrats would help him make up the shortfall, but liberals fumed at the provisions on campaign finance and derivatives, demanding they be removed from the bill.\n\nIn an odd alliance with Boehner, Obama personally called House Democrats to rally support.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said the measure included substantial funding for the fight against Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria and aid to help eradicate Ebola. It also includes nothing that would significantly impede the administration\u2019s progress in implementing the Affordable Care Act or changing the immigration system.\n\nThe White House intervention set up an uncomfortable split with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco), who was leading the Democratic opposition along with Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles) and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), a liberal favorite and potential 2016 presidential hopeful.\n\nThey warned that softening the 2010 Dodd-Frank law would leave Americans vulnerable to the same kind of risky banking practices that led to the 2008 Great Recession and financial industry bailout.\n\nEarnest acknowledged the division between the administration and Pelosi, whom the president has previously credited with helping to pass some of the \u201cmost important achievements\u201d of his time in office, including the 2010 Affordable Healthcare Act. \u201cWe have a difference of opinion here,\u201d Earnest said.\n\nWhat Boehner had expected to be quick passage of the bill before the holiday break turned into a game of chicken Thursday afternoon as the chamber recessed for hours and lawmakers huddled in backroom talks.\n\nBy early evening, White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough rushed to the Capitol to meet with House Democrats. He told them the White House had also felt blindsided by the provisions and had asked Senate Democrats to help remove them from the bill.\n\n\u201cWe learned about these provisions when you did, and we pushed the Senate to take them out,\u201d McDonough told House Democrats, according to a person inside the meeting who did not want to be identified discussing the private session.\n\nAt first, lawmakers hunkered down for a long night. But mindful of the unpopular 16-day shutdown last year, neither side appeared willing to allow the standoff to close the government again. A vote was called shortly after 9 p.m. EST.\n\nIt was unclear how much the White House influenced congressional Democrats, who have long complained that Obama has done little to keep up relationships with his natural allies.\n\nFifty-seven Democrats voted in favor the bill and 139 opposed. On the Republican side, 162 voted in favor and 67 against.\n\nSome Democrats calculated that the spending bill, although imperfect, was better than what they could get after Republicans take full control of Congress in January.\n\n\u201cWhat part of \u2018we\u2019re going to have a Republican majority in the Senate\u2019 do you not get?\u201d said Rep. Gerald Connolly (D-Va.). \u201cWe don\u2019t live in a perfect world. This is a balancing act.\u201d\n\nThe 1,600-page spending bill will fund most the government until the end of the fiscal year in September. In a nod to GOP conservatives, Boehner proposed that funding for the Homeland Security Department, which oversees immigration agencies, be renewed only until February. The move was portrayed as a protest against Obama's executive action to defer deportation for up to 5 million immigrants in the country illegally.\n\nAlso Thursday, the Senate advanced a must-pass defense authorization bill, which includes a massive public-lands package that has angered some environmentalists. Democrats and Republicans agreed 85 to 14 to move the bill forward, with final passage expected Friday.\n\nTwitter: @lisamascaro\n\n@cparsons\n\n@mikememoli\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "With push from Obama, House passes spending bill to avert shutdown", "date": "2014-12-11", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times", "author": "Los Angeles Times", "og": {"site_name": "latimes.com", "description": "In a dramatic, down-to-the-wire vote, the GOP-led House narrowly approved a $1.1-trillion spending bill Thursday just hours before the government\u2019s spending authority was due to expire.", "title": "With push from Obama, House passes spending bill to avert shutdown", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-house-spending-bill-20141211-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-548a60ca/turbine/la-na-house-spending-bill-20141211", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp16.13", "twitter": {"site": "@latimes", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index,follow", "keywords": "house, spending bill, vote", "fb": {"admins": 100000786395051, "page_id": 5863113009}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=373238146, app-argument=http://www.latimes.com/deeplinkid/82256787", "googlebot-news": "index", "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "news_keywords": "house, spending bill, vote", "y_key": "cee2fe4077f8d050", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "Description": "In a dramatic, down-to-the-wire vote, the GOP-led House narrowly approved a $1.1-trillion spending bill Thursday just hours before the government\u2019s spending authority was due to expire.
