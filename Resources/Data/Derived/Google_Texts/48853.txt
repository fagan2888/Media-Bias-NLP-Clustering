Denver will be cloudy and mild with the high temperature climbing above 50 degrees Monday.

“It should be a pretty nice day,” said Jim Kalina, meteorologist for the National Weather Service in Boulder.

It should also be a pretty nice evening in the mountains for an altogether different reason: more snow expected for ski resorts.

The high country could get between 2 to 7 inches of new snow beginning Monday night into Tuesday, Kalina said. Northern Colorado will get the higher totals, he said.

Another wave of snow on Wednesday will bring 3 to 6 inches of snow to the high country, he said.

That is on top of generous snowfall amounts over the weekend, when up to 21 inches of new powder fell in Routt County. Winter Park received 8 inches and Crested Butte received 19 inches of new snow over the weekend, Kalina said.

The Denver metro area could get a dusting of new snow Tuesday morning with no measurable amounts of accumulation, he said.

The high temperature will drop to 43 degrees on Tuesday and it will remain in the 40s until Friday, when the high temperature is expected to rise to the 50s again.
