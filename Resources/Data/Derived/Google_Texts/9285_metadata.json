Bush years. He\u2019s slammed the last president as a \u201cprogressive\u201d Republican, and repeated the same point on Monday responding to Jeb Bush\u2018s criticisms of Ted Cruz and the shutdown strategy. Beck suggested that after years of Bush progressivism being pushed on the public, maybe people should stop listening to them.\n\nBeck first tore into Bush\u2019s argument for an alternative health care plan, calling it borderline \u201cfascist\u201d and saying the Republican establishment is no longer contending that the government shouldn\u2019t be involved in health care, merely arguing now that they can do it better.\n\nBut it was Bush\u2019s comment about the need for \u201cself-restraint\u201d in the Obamacare fight that really set Beck off. He said, \u201cIf you guys would not have been shooting at Ted Cruz, you could have been showing the world how bad it was!\u201d\n\nHe mused, \u201cMaybe it\u2019s time to stop listening to the Bushes.\u201d Beck listed a whole array of things brought to life by the Bushes, from the PATRIOT Act to John Roberts to \u201cnever-ending wars\u201d to No Child Left Behind, and asked why on earth any conservative would ever have voted for them in the first place.\n\nWatch the video below, via BlazeTV:\n\nPlease enable Javascript to watch.\n\n[photo via screengrab]\n\n\u2014 \u2014\n\nFollow Josh Feldman on Twitter: @feldmaniac", "article_metadata": {"description": "Despite his anger at President Obama, Glenn Beck has not exactly looked back fondly on the George W.
