Pratt said Toyota has three goals, with the top priority to create \"support robots\" for domestic situations, including help for the elderly.\n\n\"Our initial goals are to: 1) improve safety by continuously decreasing the likelihood that a car will be involved in an accident; 2) make driving accessible to everyone, regardless of ability; and 3) apply Toyota technology used for outdoor mobility to indoor environments, particularly for the support of seniors. We also plan to apply our work more broadly, for example to improve production efficiency and accelerate scientific discovery in materials.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "Toyota, the world's largest car maker, announced it is investing $1 billion in a Silicon Valley research company to develop artificial intelligence.", "og": {"site_name": "UPI", "description": "Toyota, the world's largest car maker, announced it is investing $1 billion in a Silicon Valley research company to develop artificial intelligence.", "title": "Toyota to invest $1B in Silicon Valley artificial intelligence research lab", "url": "http://www.upi.com/Business_News/2015/11/07/Toyota-to-invest-1B-in-Silicon-Valley-artificial-intelligence-research-lab/7331446900711/", "image": "http://cdnph.upi.com/sv/ph/og/upi/7331446900711/2015/1/c6012c65873545dbeef78e6227f062b0/v2.1/Toyota-to-invest-1B-in-Silicon-Valley-artificial-intelligence-research-lab.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@UPI", "image": "http://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/7331446900711/2015/upi/c6012c65873545dbeef78e6227f062b0/v2.1/Toyota-to-invest-1B-in-Silicon-Valley-artificial-intelligence-research-lab.jpg?lg=4", "description": "Toyota, the world's largest car maker, announced it is investing $1 billion in a Silicon Valley research company to develop artificial intelligence.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Toyota to invest $1B in Silicon Valley artificial intelligence research lab"}, "fb": {"app_id": 130795020312660}, "keywords": "Business, Palo Alto", "google-site-verification": "vnkcuJA1Q89cLmy4OZpuQKOf5Jf6ny_RVh7BpxZ11a0", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Business, Palo Alto"}, "article_summary": "WASHINGTON, Nov. 7 (UPI) -- Toyota, the world's largest carmaker, announced it is investing $1 billion to create a Silicon Valley research company that will develop artificial intelligence and robotics.\nThe Toyota Research Institute will focus on \"smart\" cars with self-driving technologies and other technology applications \"to improve production efficiency and accelerate scientific discovery in materials.\"\nWe also plan to apply our work more broadly, for example to improve production efficiency and accelerate scientific discovery in materials.\"\n\"Toyota believes artificial intelligence has significant potential to support future industrial technologies and the creation of an entirely new industry,\" the company said.\nPratt said Toyota has three goals, with the top priority to create \"support robots\" for domestic situations, including help for the elderly."}
