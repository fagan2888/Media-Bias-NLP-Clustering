Greta Van Susteren said on Sunday that President Barack Obama's end-of-the-year press conference Friday provided further evidence of why his approval ratings have dropped so low and how the media are not helping.

Appearing on ABC's "This Week With George Stephanopoulos," the Fox News anchor criticized reporters' treatment of the president and the questions they asked at the press conference.

"The media beat up on him," Van Susteren said. "The media had bad questions. They kept punching him."

At Friday's press conference, Obama was asked several times to reflect on what some are calling the worst year of his presidency. Most notable were the questions from Fox News' Ed Henry on the NSA scandal and the question from NBC's Chuck Todd regarding the failures of the Obamacare website.

Van Susteren said that Obama's presence on Friday was "depressing" and "pathetic," concluding that the president has lost his greatest strength: "his ability to inspire."

"He sucked the oxygen out of the room," she said. "He ends the year where you just want to slit your throat almost because it was so depressing."
