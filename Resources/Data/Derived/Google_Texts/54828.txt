Sedgwick Co. dispatchers said a multi-vehicle crash has left three people injured and a portion of Kellogg blocked in west Wichita.

Dispatchers said the crash happened at about 5:45 p.m. Sunday in the eastbound lanes of Kellogg at the 135th St. W intersection.

KAKE News crews at the scene report both of Kellogg remained blocked between 119th and 135th Street West with traffic diverted until about 7:20 p.m.

Originally thought to involve potentially critical injuries, dispatchers now say three people were taken to a hospital with serious injuries.
