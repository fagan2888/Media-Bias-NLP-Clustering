Even a modest funeral service in Greece costs more than 15 times that, in a country that traditionally carries out funerals shortly after death and pays for them almost entirely in cash.\n\n\u201cEspecially this week, with the capital controls at the banks, no matter who we asked money from, we couldn\u2019t even recover our costs,\u201d said Eustratios Voulamandis, who runs a funeral home in a blue-collar neighborhood west of Athens.\n\nIn a back room of the funeral home, work carries on, as employees remove shrink wrap from coffins and use a staple gun to fasten ornamental fabric around the caskets. But Voulamandis\u2019 business relies on lump sum payments made by survivors that start at 800 euros ($866) and are currently impossible to collect.\n\n\u201cTo get started on a funeral service, we need 800-1,000 euros but people are giving us 50, 70, even 20 euros and telling us it\u2019s all they have,\u201d he said.\n\nFuneral homes demand that much money upfront because of fears they won\u2019t get paid by cash-strapped Greeks after the ceremony. And it\u2019s almost always cash. Credit cards and especially checks are rarely used for such transactions in Greece, which remains a cash-based economy.\n\nThe difficulties in raising cash have produced some macabre consequences, Voulamandis and other funeral home operators said. Some bodies have had to spend more time than usual at the morgue, and some people have had to declare legal insolvency to be eligible for state-funded funerals for their relatives.", "article_metadata": {"description": "IOUs for RIPs: Greece\u2019s cash crisis hurts funeral industry", "title": "IOUs for RIPs: Greece\u2019s cash crisis hurts funeral industry", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "IOUs for RIPs: Greece\u2019s cash crisis hurts funeral industry", "title": "IOUs for RIPs: Greece\u2019s cash crisis hurts funeral industry", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/07/19/ious_for_rips_greeces_cash_crisis_hurts_funeral_industry/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/07/greece-crisis-funerals.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "IOUs for RIPs: Greece\u2019s cash crisis hurts funeral industry", "title": "IOUs for RIPs: Greece\u2019s cash crisis hurts funeral industry", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/07/greece-crisis-funerals.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Anna Psaroudakis", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Funeral homes demand that much money upfront because of fears they won\u2019t get paid by cash-strapped Greeks after the ceremony.\nGreek funeral homes are struggling to cope with banking restrictions that limit customers to taking out only 60 euros ($65) a day in cash.\nTopics: From the Wires, NewsATHENS, Greece (AP) \u2014 Greece\u2019s cash crisis has disrupted all aspects of daily life \u2014 death included.\nThe difficulties in raising cash have produced some macabre consequences, Voulamandis and other funeral home operators said.\n\u201cTo get started on a funeral service, we need 800-1,000 euros but people are giving us 50, 70, even 20 euros and telling us it\u2019s all they have,\u201d he said."}
