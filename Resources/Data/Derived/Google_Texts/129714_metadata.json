There are ingredients found in nail polish remover, hair dye, rat poison, and rubber cement mix. All told, there are about 600 ingredients inside a cigarette, so it\u2019s hard to believe that anyone would believe a cigarette-maker\u2019s claim that their cigarettes are \u201call natural.\u201d But, according to a class-action lawsuit filed against American Spirit cigarette maker Santa Fe Natural Tobacco Company and its parent, Reynolds American Inc, that\u2019s exactly the case.\n\nThe class-action suit was filed by Joules Sproule in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida. It falls back on warnings from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that state using words like \u201cnatural\u201d and \u201cadditive-free\u201d in the promotion of cigarettes is against federal law. The plaintiff claims that the cigarette maker used this marketing strategy to deliberately mislead smokers into thinking that their cigarette products are a healthier option when compared to other tobacco products.\n\nIndeed, the Santa Fe website supports Sproule\u2019s claims, saying, \u201c Natural American Spirit products are made with 100 percent additive-free tobacco and include 13 cigarette styles and four roll-your-own styles,\u201d the site says. These words have allegedly been a part of Santa Fe\u2019s marketing strategy since the company was founded more than 30 years ago.\n\nSproule\u2019s lawsuit, however, notes that while overall sales of cigarettes in the U.S. dropped 17 percent between 2009 and 2014, sales of American Spirit cigarettes grew more than 86 percent. The suit is seeking damages to all those who use American Spirit cigarettes on the basis that they were deceived into thinking the cigarettes were a healthier alternative.\n\nUsing words like \u201cadditive-free,\u201d \u201cnatural,\u201d and \u201corganic\u201d are deceptive in today\u2019s market, especially for those who are trying to be healthier and more environmentally conscious, the lawsuit argues. What\u2019s more, the lawsuit states that Santa Fe takes advantage exploits the idea of healthiness by selling its cigarettes in health food stores.\n\nSanta Fe made no comment on the matter other than to say it is attempting to meet with the FDA to discuss its marketing strategy.\n\nThough it might seem shocking that people believe a cigarette maker's claims of natural or organic cigarettes, research has found that people are still in the dark when it comes to what\u2019s inside their cigarettes, thanks in part to deceptive marketing. The FDA has also been aware of these marketing strategies for some time now and has warned that cigarette labels can be misleading.\n\n\u201cThe FDA\u2019s job is to ensure tobacco products are not marketed in a way that leads consumers to believe cigarettes with descriptors like 'additive-free' and 'natural' pose fewer health risks than other cigarettes, unless the claims have been scientifically supported,\u201d said Mitch Zeller, director of the FDA\u2019s Center for Tobacco Products, in August after the FDA issued warning letters to three companies, including Santa Fe. \u201cThis action is a milestone and a reminder how we use the tools of science-based regulation to protect the U.S. public from the harmful effects of tobacco use.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "american spirit deceptive marketing cigarettes santa fe natural organic additive free", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "American Spirit is being sued over the deceptive marketing of its \"additive-free,\" \"natural,\" and \"organic\" cigarettes.", "title": "American Spirit Sued For Marketing Its Cigarettes As 'Natural'", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/american-spirit-sued-class-action-lawsuit-over-deceptive-marketing-their-natural-355858", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/10/05/american-spirit.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "American Spirit is being sued over the deceptive marketing of its \"additive-free,\" \"natural,\" and \"organic\" cigarettes.", "title": "American Spirit Sued For Marketing Its Cigarettes As 'Natural'", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/american-spirit-sued-class-action-lawsuit-over-deceptive-marketing-their-natural-355858", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/10/05/american-spirit.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/10/05/american-spirit.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-10-05T17:59:17-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-05T17:59:16-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "American Spirit is being sued over the deceptive marketing of its \"additive-free,\" \"natural,\" and \"organic\" cigarettes."}, "article_summary": "Sproule\u2019s lawsuit, however, notes that while overall sales of cigarettes in the U.S. dropped 17 percent between 2009 and 2014, sales of American Spirit cigarettes grew more than 86 percent.\nThe suit is seeking damages to all those who use American Spirit cigarettes on the basis that they were deceived into thinking the cigarettes were a healthier alternative.\nWhat\u2019s more, the lawsuit states that Santa Fe takes advantage exploits the idea of healthiness by selling its cigarettes in health food stores.\nIndeed, the Santa Fe website supports Sproule\u2019s claims, saying, \u201c Natural American Spirit products are made with 100 percent additive-free tobacco and include 13 cigarette styles and four roll-your-own styles,\u201d the site says.\nAll told, there are about 600 ingredients inside a cigarette, so it\u2019s hard to believe that anyone would believe a cigarette-maker\u2019s claim that their cigarettes are \u201call natural.\u201d But, according to a class-action lawsuit filed against American Spirit cigarette maker Santa Fe Natural Tobacco Company and its parent, Reynolds American Inc, that\u2019s exactly the case."}
