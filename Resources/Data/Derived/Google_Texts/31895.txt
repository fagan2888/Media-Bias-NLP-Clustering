Bain Capital and Belden have also recently bulked up security offerings through acquisitions

Cybersecurity business Keyw Holding Corp. (Nasdaq: KEYW) has acquired Ponte Technologies LLC and Milestone Intelligence Group Inc. in an effort to expand security offerings for government and business clients.

The news comes as recent hacking incidents, including a widely-publicized breach at Sony Pictures, causes companies and the government to adapt a heightened focus on cybersecurity.

Ponte, headquartered in Ellicott City, Maryland, provides cybersecurity engineering, cryptography, security automation, vulnerability assessment, penetration testing and malware analysis services to government and commercial customers, mostly in the financial services sector. Hanover, Maryland-based Milestone provides similar services to the intelligence community.

Keyw, also headquartered in Hanover, says acquisitions are a significant part of the company's growth strategy, in its latest annual filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, on March 9.

Companies have been adding cybersecurity businesses lately to add to services as demand grows.

(NYSE: BDC) acquired Thoma Bravo-backed Tripwire, also a cybersecurity business, for $710 million.
