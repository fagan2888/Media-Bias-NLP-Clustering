The move comes a week after the House torpedoed the Senate\u2019s Medicaid Expansion plan.\n\n--\n\nThe deal reached by lawmakers would keep the Low-Income Pool program at $2 billion\u2014roughly where it is now. The move comes after the federal government told the state it would reduce its contribution to the program\u2014resulting in a nearly 55 percent cut. Lawmakers, as noted by House Health Care Committee staff member Eric Pridgeon, have come up with a way to fill in the rest.\n\nPridgeon says the legislature gets the program back up to $2 billion by increasing payment rates in other programs that get a federal match. It will also put $400 million in state money into boosting the program to draw down additional federal dollars.\n\nHouse Speaker Steve Crisafulli says the deal has helped moved state budget talks forward. While there are several issue still pending, like environmental funding and education, Crisafulli says the process is now going smoothly.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see anything out there that\u2019s still an outlier but certainly you never know what can come about. Things are going well,\" he said.\n\nBut as the legislature inches closer to a state budget deal the battle over healthcare is not over. the House approved its version of healthcare reform: focusing on issues its leaders say will reduce costs.\n\nOne proposal gets rid of regulations dictating where hospitals can be built. The program is called, \u201ccertificate of need\u201d and its premise is a hospital or other healthcare facility should be built when there\u2019s a need in a community.\n\nBut Rep. Jason Brodeur, R-Sanford, thinks the process is outdated and hinders competition, \u201cbecause Capital costs are so high in healthcare facilities, it is thought that limiting those expenditures you\u2019ll will put a cap on expenses. However, whether or not CON accomplishes this is in question. Various studies indicate CON programs do not reduce costs.\u201d\n\nBrodeur says 22 other states have dropped their certificate of Need, or CON rules. The program is getting targeted by Governor Rick Scott, who believes more competition, not regulation, is what drives down costs. But Rep. Janet Cruz, D-Tampa, says eliminating the regulation could also hinder access to uninsured and poor patients.\n\n\u201cThe elimination of certificate of need could result in care gaps for the less affluent, the rural areas and the inner city communities. The market forces simply won\u2019t encourage competition for the uninsured. That\u2019s just the way this works,\" she said.\n\nThe House also approved measures to give advanced registered nurses the ability to prescribe schedule I drugs and a plan to revamp state employee health insurance. The proposals are now before the Senate. And the chamber is still simmering over simmering over a house vote that killed its top priority\u2014Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act. Senate President Andy Gardiner says the House bills don\u2019t meet the senate\u2019s desire to see more people insured.\n\n\u201cBut we\u2019ll give them their due and if they\u2019re good policy and they make good sense, we\u2019ll move them.\u201d\n\nStill the votes are getting the legislature closer to a final budget, which has to be in place before the start of the July first fiscal year. Gardiner expects the legislature will vote on a state spending plan on the 19th\u2014a day before the legislature is set to conclude its special budget writing session.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health & Science", "description": "Florida lawmakers have reached a deal on one of the most contentious issue facing the legislature this year\u2014how to fill a billion-dollar hole.
