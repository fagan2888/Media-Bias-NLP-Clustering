Obviously, if you’re female and you haven’t yet declared your ladyparts to be in the service of Hillary Clinton, your true gender is in question. And since it’s been nearly a month since her highness announced her intent to rule over America like a feudal lord, it’s about time they start using hardened Hillary supporters to recruit you into the collective. After all, the longer you hold out, the more painful it will be.

This Mother’s Day, why give your mother flowers or perfume like every year when you can give her the gift of female solidarity? After all, she’s the woman who created you to be the woman that you are, and if there’s any chance our gender, which is now 51% of America, hopes to survive, we must join together to lift up a politican who proves that women can be just as corrupt, entitled, and out of touch as any man.

So if you’re truly serious, why not have Hillary Clinton call your mom on her special day to explain to her exactly that.

There will be five lucky winners, you guys. And by the looks of it, only 282 shares. That means, if everyone who shares it also enters, your chances of winning are pretty solid! Or rather, your chance of giving your mother the Mother’s Day that she’ll never forget because therapy for this kind of problem costs just too much, and no one can afford extraneous medical care under Obamacare, your chances of winning are pretty solid!
