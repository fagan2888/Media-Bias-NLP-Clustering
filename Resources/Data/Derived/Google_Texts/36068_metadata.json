We had a very good and encouraging productive conversation on just how to do that. It was important that we discussed our differences that we have but it was also important that we discussed the core principles that tie us together. Principles like the Constitution, the separation of powers, the fact that we have an executive that is going way beyond the boundaries of the Constitution and how it\u0092s important to us that we restore Article 1 of the Constitution.\u0092\n\nClick Image to Enlarge Elliott Banfield / Courtesy the artist\n\n* * *\n\nThose words from the Speaker of the American House, Paul Ryan, after his meeting with Donald Trump, mark the most encouraging moment of the campaign so far. It\u0092s not just that they offer the hope that peace might be made within the Republican Party. Mr. Ryan\u0092s words offer something more than that. For the most worrisome rift in America today is not that between the various Republican factions. It is the rift between the President and the Congress.\n\nBridging that divide is holy writ here at the Sun. This is why, in advance of their meeting, we issued the editorial \u0093Paul Ryan\u0092s Powers.\u0094 It noted Mr. Trump\u0092s talk about how he wants cut taxes, renegotiate our foreign debts, rebuild the military, and deregulate business. \u0093That\u0092s all great,\u0094 we added, \u0093but the Constitution (which Mr. Trump would, if elected, have to swear to preserve, protect, and defend) grants every one of those powers to the lanky Wisconsinite and his colleagues in the Congress.\u0094\n\nDemocrats like to blame the dysfunction on the Congress. It\u0092s not the president who shut down the government, they\u0092ll insist, but the radicals in the Congress. When Congress disapproves of the Iran pact, the President goes off and inks the pact anyhow \u0097 and then takes it to the United Nations and to maneuver against America\u0092s own legislature. Mr. Obama ignores the Congress on immigration and Obamacare spending. It\u0092s hard to remember an administration so unable \u0097 or unwilling \u0097 to work with Congress.\n\nMessrs. Trump and Ryan met for less than an hour, but in 45 minutes they seem to have discussed their differences in the framework of the Constitution and its bedrock principles. This is the significance of Mr. Ryan\u0092s remarks. To hear him report that they talked about a restoration of Article 1 is music to our ears. It\u0092s not that we oppose a strong president (we were writing editorials during Reagan years). It\u0092s that we also support a strong legislature.\n\nIts powers are the first powers of government. They are enumerated and written down. They include, to name but a few, the power to tax, to borrow, to regulate, to coin, and to declare war (but not to declare peace, which is not granted to any branch of the government (our own view is that it can be done only by a surrendering enemy)). The idea that a president can proceed without reference to the possession of these powers by the Congress is scandalous.\n\nThe president has his own powers, of course. These include his powers as commander-in-chief, to make treaties (provided that two thirds of the Senators in the chamber concur); to require opinions from department heads; to pardon offenses against the United States; to appoint judges, government ministers, and ambassadors; to commission offices, and to fill vacancies during a legislative recess. We wouldn\u0092t say these powers are nothing. But they are basically it.\n\nSo it\u0092s as refreshing as can be to hear that Messrs. Trump and Ryan discussed the importance of a restoration of Article 1. Let them keep going. And also move on to the disabilities that are laid on the government. These prohibitions \u0097 things it can never do \u0097 are basic stuff, like making a law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof, or abridging freedom of speech, or infringing the right of the people to keep and bear arms, etc. All are denials of power to the government.\n\nThe Founders famously feared factions, a point well-marked in Dan Henninger\u0092s column in the Wall Street Journal yesterday. Yet the Constitution does not contain the word faction; the power to unify is one that is, to use the constitutional lingo, \u0093reserved\u0094 to the people. The unifying element to the Constitution is that it is the only law that all officers, legislators, and judges of the federal and state governments must be bound by oath to support. We\u0092ll soon see whether Secretary Clinton and Senator Sanders will be able to rise to the example Messrs. Ryan and Trump have just set.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "The Trump Ryan Example", "og": {"url": "http://www.nysun.com/editorials/the-trump-ryan-example/89583/"}, "description": "\u0091The question is what is it that we need to do to unify the Republican Party and all strains of conservative wings of the party.
