He only called for an ambulance later, reportedly not wanting to miss the end of an exciting playoff game between the Celtics and the Miami Heat.\n\nDershowitz told the Globe that he had to walk with a cane following the incident, and is still suffering after his fall. Dershowitz claims that he could need additional surgery on his knee.\n\nNeither Dershowitz nor the Garden responded to Business Insider's request for comment.\n\nDershowitz's name came up in the news earlier this year, when he was mentioned in a lawsuit filed by two women who were allegedly sex-trafficked as minors by the financier Jeffrey Epstein. A legal filing in the case, which didn't name Dershowitz as a defendant, said the Harvard professor had sex with an underage girl.\n\nDershowitz denied the allegations, and a judge subsequently ordered that the claims about him be stricken from the record.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#185f7c", "sailthru.author": "Maxwell Tani", "application-name": "Business Insider", "twitter": {"description": "Dershowitz claims a lack of paper towels at a Celtics game are to blame for a bad fall.", "creator": "maxwelltani", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/harvard-professor-alan-dershowitz-sues-td-garden-2015-6", "image": "http://static3.businessinsider.com/image/55705dc76bb3f77659c67cd0-506-253/famous-harvard-law-professor-sues-td-garden-over-3-year-old-slip-and-fall.jpg", "title": "Famous Harvard law professor sues TD garden over 3-year-old slip-and-fall", "site": "BI_Lawandorder", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.verticals": "law,sportspage", "linkedin": {"owner": "mid:1d5f7b"}, "sailthru.tags": "Alan Dershowitz, OJ Simpson, Boston Celtics, Maxwell Tani", "description": "Dershowitz claims a lack of paper towels at a Celtics game are to blame for a bad fall.", "author": "Maxwell Tani", "sailthru.date": "2015-06-04", "sailthru.title": "Famous Harvard law professor sues TD garden over 3-year-old slip-and-fall", "theme-color": "#185f7c", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://static5.businessinsider.com/image/55705dbdeab8eaa005c67ccf-50-50/famous-harvard-law-professor-sues-td-garden-over-3-year-old-slip-and-fall.jpg", "news_keywords": "Alan Dershowitz, OJ Simpson, Boston Celtics, Maxwell Tani", "tbi-image": "http://static1.businessinsider.com/image/55705dbdeab8eaa005c67ccf/famous-harvard-law-professor-sues-td-garden-over-3-year-old-slip-and-fall.jpg", "fb": {"app_id": 155043519637}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://static1.businessinsider.com/assets/images/us/favicons/mstile-144x144.png?v=BI-US-2016-03-31", "date": "2015-06-04", "article": {"publisher": "businessinsider", "author": "http://www.businessinsider.com/author/maxwell-tani"}, "sailthru.description": "Dershowitz claims a lack of paper towels at a Celtics game are to blame for a bad fall.", "viewport": "width=1024", "og": {"site_name": "Business Insider", "description": "Dershowitz claims a lack of paper towels at a Celtics game are to blame for a bad fall.", "title": "Famous Harvard law professor sues TD garden over 3-year-old slip-and-fall", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/harvard-professor-alan-dershowitz-sues-td-garden-2015-6", "image": "http://static1.businessinsider.com/image/55705dc76bb3f77659c67cd0-1190-625/famous-harvard-law-professor-sues-td-garden-over-3-year-old-slip-and-fall.jpg", "type": "article"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Business Insider", "title": "Famous Harvard law professor sues TD garden over 3-year-old slip-and-fall", "sailthru.image.full": "http://static1.businessinsider.com/image/55705dbdeab8eaa005c67ccf/famous-harvard-law-professor-sues-td-garden-over-3-year-old-slip-and-fall.jpg", "tbi-vertical": "law"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc2f3\"", "article_summary": "Dershowitz claims that he could need additional surgery on his knee.\nOne of America's most high-profile lawyers is suing Boston's TD Garden over a fall he blames on a wet bathroom floor and lack of paper towels.\nA legal filing in the case, which didn't name Dershowitz as a defendant, said the Harvard professor had sex with an underage girl.\nThe fall, however, did not stop the Harvard law professor \u2014 a longtime Celtics fan \u2014 from staying for the rest of the game.\nDershowitz denied the allegations, and a judge subsequently ordered that the claims about him be stricken from the record."}
