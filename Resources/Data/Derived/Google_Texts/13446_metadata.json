Mike Huckabee in Little Rock, Ark.\n\nFormer Arkansas Governor and Fox News commentator Mike Huckabee (R) is planning to make an announcement Friday evening about his 2016 presidential campaign plans. Huckabee told reporters Friday that he was the best Republican contender to challenge \u201cthe Clinton political machine\u201d \u2014 but he\u2019ll have a hard time winning over female voters, a crucial group for any Republican presidential nominee.\n\nHere are some of Huckabee\u2019s most dated and outlandish ideas about women:\n\nFemale candidates are \u201cspecial treasures.\u201d In 2014, Huckabee argued that if Clinton or any other women ran for president in 2016, she would need to be treated as a \u201cspecial treasure\u201d and with a \u201csense of pedestal.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve twice run against women opponents, and it\u2019s a very different kind of approach. For those of us who have some chivalry left, there\u2019s a level of respect. \u2026 You treat some things as a special treasure; you treat other things as common.\u201d In the interview, he added that he treats his wife differently than he treats his \u201cchums\u201d and \u201cpals.\u201d\n\nDemocrats are like \u201cUncle Sugar,\u201d who think women need birth control because they can\u2019t \u201ccontrol their libido.\u201d Huckabee also said earlier in 2014 at the Republican National Convention that Democrats are sending a message to women that \u201cthey cannot control their libido\u201d by offering no-copay contraception through the Affordable Care Act. During the speech, he also likened Obamacare\u2019s expanded contraception coverage to a sugar daddy.\n\nNew York women are \u201ctrashy\u201d because they swear in the office. Earlier this year, Huckabee said in a radio interview that he experienced culture shock when he heard profanity in the workplace at Fox News in New York City. \u201cThis would be considered totally inappropriate to say these things in front of a woman,\u201d he said. \u201cFor a woman to say them in a professional setting, that\u2019s just trashy.\u201d\n\nWomen can\u2019t multitask when they\u2019re on their period. Huckabee has also speculated that women have trouble multitasking during their periods and specifically endorsed the belief that \u201cwives graciously submit to their husband\u2019s sacrificial leadership.\u201d He passionately supported former Rep. Todd Akin (R-MO) after the failed Senate candidate claimed victims of \u201clegitimate rape\u201d can\u2019t get pregnant.\n\nThe Newtown school massacre was caused by \u201ctax-funded abortion pills.\u201d After Adam Lanza opened fire in Sandy Hook Elementary School, killing 20 children and six staffers, Huckabee blamed the attack on Godless culture, rather than a proliferation of guns. Huckabee told Fox News that the shooting was not surprising given that society had \u201csystematically removed God from our schools\u201d and forced Christian businesses to \u201csurrender their values under the edict of government orders to provide tax-funded abortion pills.\u201d\n\nThe GOP has been trying to broaden its traditionally white, male base since the 2012 election, holding training sessions and advising candidates to simply avoid talking about rape. But so far, the efforts have backfired \u2013 likely due to offensive comments from Republicans like Huckabee \u2014 and the party has actually been losing women\u2019s support.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Huckabee's most dated and outlandish ideas about women may stand in the way of his presidential ambitions.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "Huckabee's most dated and outlandish ideas about women may stand in the way of his presidential ambitions.", "title": "As Huckabee Plans Presidential Run, He\u2019s Already Alienated Half The Country", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/politics/2015/04/17/3648467/huckabee-women-2016/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/AP449499219923.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Huckabee's most dated and outlandish ideas about women may stand in the way of his presidential ambitions.", "creator": "@Kira_Lerner", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/AP449499219923-321x214.jpg", "title": "As Huckabee Plans Presidential Run, He\u2019s Already Alienated Half The Country", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-politics", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/AP449499219923.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/AP449499219923.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-17T13:43:44+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/KiraLerner"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe4c6b\"", "article_summary": "Politics As Huckabee Plans Presidential Run, He\u2019s Already Alienated Half The Country CREDIT: AP Photo/Danny Johnston Leslie Rutledge, Republican candidate for Arkansas attorney general, left, speaks with former Arkansas Gov.\nFormer Arkansas Governor and Fox News commentator Mike Huckabee (R) is planning to make an announcement Friday evening about his 2016 presidential campaign plans.\nHuckabee told reporters Friday that he was the best Republican contender to challenge \u201cthe Clinton political machine\u201d \u2014 but he\u2019ll have a hard time winning over female voters, a crucial group for any Republican presidential nominee.\nBut so far, the efforts have backfired \u2013 likely due to offensive comments from Republicans like Huckabee \u2014 and the party has actually been losing women\u2019s support.\n\u201cFor a woman to say them in a professional setting, that\u2019s just trashy.\u201dWomen can\u2019t multitask when they\u2019re on their period."}
