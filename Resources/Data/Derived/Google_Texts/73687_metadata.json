Read the press release here.\n\n\u2013\n\nFamed neurosurgeon and potential 2016 GOP presidential candidate Dr. Ben Carson has been granted many honors, but his latest designation is anything but flattering.\n\nCarson has been added to a list of \u201cextremists\u201d being populated and compiled by the Southern Poverty Law Center, an Alabama-based group \u201cdedicated to fighting hate and bigotry and to seeking justice for the most vulnerable members of our society.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s Carson\u2019s apparent \u201canti-LBGT\u201d views that have landed him in the Southern Poverty Law Center\u2019s \u201cextremist files,\u201d where he is listed among other individuals in categories such as \u201danti-Muslim,\u201d \u201cKu Klux Klan\u201d and \u201cNeo-Nazi.\u201d\n\n\u201cRetired neurosurgeon Ben Carson rapidly ascended as a far-right political star after publicly scolding President Obama, whom he sat a few feet away from, at a National Prayer Breakfast in February 2013,\u201d reads the group\u2019s profile on the noted neurosurgeon. \u201cCarson\u2019s reproach of Obama for his health care and tax policies went viral, unleashing a flood of adulation from right-wing media and hate groups.\u201d\n\nThe Southern Poverty Law Center claims that Carson began speaking soon after that event to \u201cright wing and hate group gatherings,\u201d claiming that he linked gays to pedophiles and endorsed \u201cbiblical economic practices for 21st century America.\u201d The latter is likely a reference to Carson\u2019s comparison of the traditional church tithe to a flat tax system.\n\nThe profile includes a list of quotes from Carson\u2019s media appearances and writings seen by the Southern Poverty Law Center as being anti-gay \u2014 or for being, at the least, egregious. Here are just a few of those quotes:\n\n\u201cObamacare is really the worst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery. And \u2026 in a way, it is slavery.\u201d \u2014Values Voter Summit, Washington, D.C., Oct. 11, 2013 \u201cI mean [our government and institutions] are very much like Nazi Germany. \u2026 You know, you had a government using its tools to intimidate the population. We now live in a society where people are afraid to say what they really believe.\u201d \u2014Quoted by Breitbart News, March 12, 2014 \u201cWhat we need to do is come up with something simple. And when I pick up by Bible, you know what I see? I see the first individual in the universe, God, and he\u2019s given us a system. It\u2019s called a tithe.\u201d \u2014Endorsing a flat tax for all Americans, White House Prayer Breakfast, Feb. 7, 2013\n\nYou can read Carson\u2019s Southern Poverty Law Center profile in its entirety here.\n\nThis is not the first time the Southern Poverty Law Center has added a well-known conservative to one of its lists, as historian David Barton has been among those targeted by the group.\n\nAnd it\u2019s no secret that the Southern Poverty Law Center has come under fire from conservatives for its liberal inclinations in the past. The group was removed from the FBI\u2019s hate crime web page last year after conservative groups protested its initial inclusion there.\n\nAs TheBlaze previously reported, the Southern Poverty Law Center\u2019s \u201chate map\u201d targets groups with \u201cbeliefs or practices that attack or malign an entire class of people, typically for their immutable characteristics.\u201d The hate map is \u201ccompiled using hate group publications and websites, citizen and law enforcement reports, field sources and news reports,\u201d its website states.\n\nThe Southern Poverty Law Center includes Ku Klux Klan and New Black Panther Party groups on its \u201chate map,\u201d as well as organizations like the Family Research Council, a socially conservative organization. A man who was convicted of opening fire at the Family Research Council\u2019s Washington, D.C. headquarters in 2012 acknowledged that he used the \u201chate map\u201d to target the organization.\n\n(H/T: Daily Caller)", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "gplus-count": 19, "twitter": {"description": "UPDATE:\u00a0Amid controversy, the Southern Poverty Law Center has apologized and removed Dr. Ben Carson's \"extremist files\" profile.
