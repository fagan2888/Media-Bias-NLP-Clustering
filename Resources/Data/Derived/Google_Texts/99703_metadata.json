To play with the No. 1 team in the country means you can play with anyone.\u201d\n\nAnd to think that through three quarters, Alabama (3-0) and its Heisman Trophy candidate quarterback, AJ McCarron, were still without a third-down conversion. The Crimson Tide finished 2-for-10 on third downs.\n\n\u201cOur defense wouldn\u2019t take no for an answer,\u201d said CSU coach Jim McElwain, who served four seasons as Alabama\u2019s offensive coordinator (2008-11). \u201cI think guys on the other sideline learned some respect for Colorado State and how hard our guys play the game.\u201d\n\nAlabama\u2019s defense, no doubt motivated by yielding 42 points a week earlier in a win over Texas A&M, was determined to keep the Rams out of the end zone. The Crimson Tide did just that. Colorado State did not penetrate Alabama territory in the first half. And the Crimson Tide defense dug in and forced the Rams to settle for field goals after two drives in the third quarter.\n\n\u201c(Alabama\u2019s defense) wants to throw a shutout,\u201d CSU\u2019s McElwain said, \u201cand what I mean is no yards. We did a few things (offensively). Some things we\u2019d like to have back. But I\u2019m proud of our guys.\u201d\n\nAlabama\u2019s defense created the biggest play of the game, forcing a fumble by Grayson at the CSU 30 early in the fourth quarter. Crimson Tide linebacker Trey DePriest made the hit and recovered the ball.\n\nOn Alabama\u2019s first play after the turnover, McCarron hit a wide-open DeAndrew White for a 30-yard touchdown to put the game away at 24-6 with 11:55 remaining. A senior, McCarron finished 20-for-26 for 258 yards and one touchdown.\n\nThe Crimson Tide netted just 66 yard rushing on 21 attempts \u2014 topped by 56 yards on seven tries by All-America candidate T.J. Yeldon, who accounted for 49 of those yards on one breakaway run.\n\n\u201cWe obviously made some mistakes,\u201d Alabama coach Nick Saban said. \u201cWe missed some big plays offensively.\u201d\n\nRams cornerback Bernard Blake, also a junior, can etch his name among the select few who have intercepted McCarron, who threw only three interceptions in 2012 and led the nation in pass efficiency. Blake recorded the turnover by jumping a sideline route at the CSU 17-yard-line in the third quarter. That set up the Rams\u2019 first score, a 45-yard field goal by Jared Roberts.\n\nRoberts added a 31-yard field goal five seconds before the end of the third quarter.\n\nFor the Rams offense, true freshman wide receiver Rashard Higgins had seven receptions for 71 yards. Grayson remained poised in the pocket, even with future NFL draft choices flying by him, and finished 24-of-38 passing for 228 yards, without an interception.\n\nWith one nonconference game remaining \u2014 Saturday at home against UTEP \u2014 Colorado State should have gained a ton of confidence knowing that it went toe to toe with the No. 1 team in front of the biggest crowd any Rams team has played in front of and held its own.\n\n\u201cThis is the No. 1 team in the nation,\u201d CSU senior center Weston Richburg said. \u201cBeing able to hang with them is exciting (for the future).\u201d\n\nTom Kensler: tkensler@denverpost.com or twitter.com/tomkensler\n\nKey stat\n\nAs well as Colorado State played against the nation\u2019s best, the Rams moved into Alabama territory only three times (the last on the final possession with the outcome decided) and had to settle for two third-quarter field goals.\n\nKey play\n\nAfter Colorado State had cut the Alabama lead to 17-6 late in the third quarter, Crimson Tide Heisman Trophy candidate AJ McCarron connected with wide receiver DeAndrew White for a 30-yard touchdown with 11:47 remaining.\n\nTom Kensler, The Denver Post", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "CSU Rams hang tough before losing 31-6 to top-ranked Alabama", "title": "CSU Rams hang tough before losing 31-6 to top-ranked Alabama", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/09/21/csu-rams-hang-tough-before-losing-31-6-to-top-ranked-alabama/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130921__20130922_C1_SP22FBCCSUp2.jpg", "height": 389}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130921__20130922_C1_SP22FBCCSUp2.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-09-21T20:21:10+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-29T11:08:50+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0043\"", "article_summary": "1 team in front of the biggest crowd any Rams team has played in front of and held its own.\nTotal yards: Alabama 338, CSU 279.\nCrimson Tide linebacker Trey DePriest made the hit and recovered the ball.\nThe Crimson Tide finished 2-for-10 on third downs.\nAnd the Crimson Tide defense dug in and forced the Rams to settle for field goals after two drives in the third quarter."}
