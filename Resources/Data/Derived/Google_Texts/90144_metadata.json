And it could become costly, the AP reported.\n\nThe average food stamp payment is $125.35 per month. For the 632,000 new food stamp users in the 11 states, that would be another $79 million cost to the taxpayers.\n\nThe AP noted that it can\u2019t be definitively determined whether the entire increase is a result the Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamcare.\n\nIn most states the increase was between 1 percent and 6 percent over the last two years.
