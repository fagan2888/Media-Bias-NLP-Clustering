Most of the nation\u2019s state-run 13 health exchanges now offer separate dental plans serving adults and the federally run exchange also offers adult dental coverage.\n\nCovered California is the second to last among the state-run exchanges to offer dental coverage for adults, said Jeff Album, a Delta Dental executive. Now only Washington state does not offer it.\n\nIn California, adults must purchase a health plan on the state\u2019s exchange to be able to purchase an \u201cadd-on\u201d dental policy, and they\u2019ll pay monthly premiums ranging from $11 to $65, Lee said this week. These premiums are not subsidized like Covered California\u2019s health premiums for lower-income people, but the dental plans can\u2019t turn anyone away for pre-existing conditions.\n\nThe dental plans are optional, and there\u2019s no tax penalty for not enrolling in them.\n\nOpen enrollment in the state exchange\u2019s health and dental plans started Nov. 1 and ends Jan. 31, and people who sign up by Dec. 15 can have their benefits start on Jan. 1. Lee said Wednesday that 34,000 new consumers had selected a health insurance plan through the exchange since open enrollment began.\n\nAbout 1.3 million Californians, including about 66,000 age 18 or younger, already had health insurance through the exchange before open enrollment started.\n\nCovered California\u2019s new dental plans are offered by Access Dental Plan, Anthem Blue Cross of California, Delta Dental of California, Dental Health Services and Premier Access. Delta Dental has signed up 23,000 of the 33,000 people who\u2019ve purchased dental policies so far, Album said.\n\nAll of the plans will offer free preventive and diagnostic dental services for both adults and children. Consumers can choose from dental health maintenance organizations, which typically cost less but have more restricted networks of dentists, or dental preferred provider organizations, which offer more choice but have higher out-of-pocket costs. Parents do not have to enroll their children in a family dental plan, because their dental coverage is included in their health plan. But some may choose to do so to gain extra coverage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDr. Ariane Terlet, a Berkeley dentist who serves as chief dental officer for Oakland-based La Clinica de la Raza and as a trustee for the California Dental Association, said that people without dental insurance are four times more likely to not get preventive care. Many Californians have found it difficult to buy dental coverage on the individual market and the new availability of Covered California\u2019s dental plans expands access to care, she added.\n\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t a week that goes by where people don\u2019t ask me what dental coverage is available for individuals,\u201d Terlet said. \u201cHaving insurance is a critical step to improving dental care. This is really going to help a lot of people improve their health.\u201d\n\nKaiser Health News is an editorially independent program of the Menlo Park-based Kaiser Family Foundation.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Thousands of California adults are signing up for dental insurance offered for the first time by the state\u2019s health insurance exchange, Covered California.About 33,000 adults have signed up for the dental plans, including about 6,000 who", "title": "Obamacare: Thousands of Californians sign up for new dental plans", "og": {"url": "http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/article/NE/20151119/NEWS/151119627", "image": {"width": "470px", "identifier": "http://local.santacruzsentinel.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/small/santacruzsentinel.png?052016", "height": "247px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Obamacare: Thousands of Californians sign up for new dental plans"}, "twitter": {"domain": "santacruzsentinel.com", "description": "Thousands of California adults are signing up for dental insurance offered for the first time by the state\u2019s health insurance exchange, Covered California.About 33,000 adults have signed up for the dental plans, including about 6,000 who", "title": "Obamacare: Thousands of Californians sign up for new dental plans", "url": "http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/article/NE/20151119/NEWS/151119627", "image": {"src": "http://local.santacruzsentinel.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/small/santacruzsentinel.png?052016"}, "site": "@scsentinel", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id563358177?mt=8", "iphone": "id499677382?mt=8", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.californianewspaperpartnership.santacruzsentinel"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "Health, Health news, Santa Cruz Health news, CA Health news, US Health news, world Health news.", "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Health, Health news, Santa Cruz Health news, CA Health news, US Health news, world Health news."}, "article_summary": "Covered California\u2019s new dental plans are offered by Access Dental Plan, Anthem Blue Cross of California, Delta Dental of California, Dental Health Services and Premier Access.\nMany Californians have found it difficult to buy dental coverage on the individual market and the new availability of Covered California\u2019s dental plans expands access to care, she added.\nParents do not have to enroll their children in a family dental plan, because their dental coverage is included in their health plan.\nThousands of California adults are signing up for dental insurance offered for the first time by the state\u2019s health insurance exchange, Covered California.\nMost of the nation\u2019s state-run 13 health exchanges now offer separate dental plans serving adults and the federally run exchange also offers adult dental coverage."}
