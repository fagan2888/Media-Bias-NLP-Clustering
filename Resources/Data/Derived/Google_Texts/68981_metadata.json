Winning is Cheaper Than Losing\u2014and Better for our Health!\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nAs I seek to develop my ideas of a Cure Strategy against disease, it has come to my attention\u2014that is, I have read the readers\u2019 comments\u2014that many Breitbart readers regard my vision or healthcare abundance as liberal, as in, you know, on the left.\n\nAnd I\u2019ll admit it: Those comments kinda stung. Because me, a liberal? Nothing could be further from the truth.\n\nA little background on me: Beginning in 1979, I was a volunteer for the Reagan for President campaign in Los Angeles. That\u2019s Reagan as in Ronald Wilson Reagan. That experience meant the world to me, personally and professionally; I was thrilled when, in the following year, 1980, the Gipper not only won the GOP nomination but also, of course, the national election, defeating Jimmy Carter.\n\nNearly four decades later, whenever I land at LAX airport, I make a point of driving by the building that contained the headquarters, 9841 Airport Boulevard, and I have a little moment of misty-eyed nostalgia.\n\nBeginning in 1981, I served as a policy aide in the Reagan White House. Later on, I worked on President Reagan\u2019s re-election campaign, reporting directly to Ed Rollins and the late Lee Atwater. And of course, I was delighted that our campaign carried 49 states\u2014although, of course, it\u2019s the Gipper himself who deserves all the credit. Since then, I have also worked on the presidential campaigns of Bush 41 in 1988 and 1992 and Mike Huckabee in 2008. I have been a Contributor to Fox News since 1996. I am pro-life and anti-welfare. I think global warming is a crock; I support the death penalty; so I trust you are getting a good idea of where I am coming from, ideologically.\n\nSo while you still may or may not agree with my ideas on healthcare, I hope you will at least see that I am coming from the same ideological quadrant as the bulk of Breitbart readers.\n\nSo now, let\u2019s talk a little bit more about the healthcare issue. As I wrote in my August 8 article for Breitbart, I think we should cure disease; I think providing medical cures to people is more valuable than extending insurance coverage.\n\nIn fact, I\u2019ll go further: I think our national strategy should be to cure disease\u2014the Cure Strategy. Curing disease is a good conservative idea because it\u2019s smart to do so\u2014it\u2019s the best approach for society, and it\u2019s also the most economical. By contrast, what we\u2019re doing now\u2014we are financing illness\u2014is not particularly smart and certainly not inexpensive.\n\nMy ideas on strategy come straight from Carl von Clausewitz, the 19th century Prussian military strategist, who stressed the need for an efficient approach to national strategy.\n\nClausewitz\u2019s point was that nations have to align their goals and their means to achieve their ends. That\u2019s how they can win. And I agree.\n\nClausewitz died in 1831, so it\u2019s a bit risky to apply his wisdom to situations he didn\u2019t live to see, but here goes\u2014after all, strategic scholars do it all the time.\n\nFor Americans, I think that Clausewitzian clarity can be applied, even in situations in which Germany was the enemy. That is, Clausewitz the timeless teacher transcends whatever kneejerk nationalism the actual man might have felt.\n\nSo if we apply Clausewitz to the issues of US grand strategy in World War Two, for example, we can see that America was wise to focus on Hitler\u2019s Germany. That is, the main enemy was not the Nazi German client state of Bulgaria, even though the US was technically in a state of war with the pro-Nazi government of that Balkan country. Instead, the big foe was Nazi Germany, and the quicker we saw that, the quicker we could go about defeating the Berlin regime. And that\u2019s what we did: We defeated Hitler in less than four years.\n\nMeanwhile, at the same time, in the Asian theater, we needed equal clarity about our true foe. We were technically at war with the Japanese puppet state of Manchukuo, but that didn\u2019t really matter: The prime enemy, of course, was Japan. And it\u2019s a good thing that American leaders saw that strategy clearly back in the 40s. That\u2019s how we were able to win in the Pacific, also in less than four years.\n\nSimilarly, in the Cold War, our enemy was not the Warsaw Pact countries such as Poland or Czechoslovakia, which had been forced into an American stance by Stalin. No, our rival in that chilly conflict was the USSR. Opposing Moscow at every turn was the central idea of American foreign policy for four decades, and it worked.\n\nAnd so, now, to the geopolitics of today: I agree with those who say that you can\u2019t defeat what you can\u2019t or won\u2019t name. And so if we are in a war with Islamic radicalism\u2014be it Al Qaeda or ISIS or simply some Jihadi free-lancer\u2014we can see with the clarity of Clausewitz: If we want to win, we need clear thinking about mobilizing our resources, and getting them aimed at the right targets\u2014the radicals and terrorists. As an aside, I might ask: Does this sound like a \u201cliberal\u201d approach? I did\u2019t think so.\n\nOkay, now let\u2019s shift to a different grand strategic issue: healthcare, or, to put it even more simply, health. Surely health\u2014which is to say, the fate of each and every one of us\u2014is an issue that lends itself to grand-strategic analysis.\n\nSpecifically, let\u2019s ask: In the same way that we zeroed in on Germany, and Japan, and the Soviet Union during past wars, do we have a focused strategy for the war against disease? Do we have a plan for curing certain dreaded and costly diseases, starting with, for example, Alzheimer\u2019s Disease (AD), which costs America hundreds of billions a year, headed toward trillions a year? Surely, good sound Clausewitzian healthcare strategizing\u2014that is, zeroing in on the real enemy\u2014would include a vision for victory over AD.\n\nYet once again, we can see that we can\u2019t defeat an enemy if we can\u2019t or won\u2019t name it. That is, if the issue is preserving public health, then let\u2019s confront the causes of ill-health\u2014most obviously, disease. And here\u2019s where we as a nation fall weirdly short: we can\u2019t seem to bring ourselves to talk about the real enemy, which is illness. The finance of healthcare is an interesting and important question: But the actual science of curing disease and fixing the problem is even more important.\n\nIf you want to see what I mean, take virtually any news article on Obamacare, and search\u2014on my computer, one uses the F2 command\u2014 for the words, \u201cresearch,\u201d \u201cmedicine,\u201d and \u201ccures.\u201d Chances are, you won\u2019t find those words in the text of the article, because neither side in the healthcare fight\u2014not the pro-Obamacare Democrats, nor the anti-Obamacare Republicans\u2014have chosen to bring them up. That is, the Obamacare combatants want to wrangle about the individual mandate or some other aspect of the program, but not about whether there\u2019s a cure for, say, Alzheimer\u2019s. And yet surely it\u2019s the diseases themselves that are the big driver of healthcare costs.\n\nOnce again, it\u2019s axiomatic that if you can\u2019t or won\u2019t name the enemy, you\u2019re not going to defeat it. So we can have a fight over the management and ideology of financing healthcare costs, and yet still discover that if that\u2019s all we end up with\u2014 that is, if we continue to ignore the diseases themselves\u2014then the result will be pretty darn expensive to society, no matter which entity, public or private, is paying the ultimate bill. Which is another way of saying that the status quo of today\u2014in which we have lots of finance, not not nearly enough in the way of cures\u2014is both wildly expensive and not very good. We spend more three trillion a year on healthcare, but we don\u2019t have cures, or even treatments, for big-ticket illnesses, starting, as noted, with AD. In other words, we haven\u2019t done a very good job of organizing our resources for victory.\n\nMichael Milken, the inspiring medical philanthropist, nicely illustrates the point about how a cure is cheaper than care:\n\nWhen I was a child in the early 1950s, economists estimated that by the year 2000, treating polio would cost the United States $100 billion annually. Today\u2019s polio immunization programs cost one thousand times less than that and have virtually eliminated the disease.\n\nEureka! That\u2019s how you save money on polio: Make polio go away. You won\u2019t be spending any money on wheelchairs, braces, and iron lungs, and that will, indeed, save a lot of money. (Thank you, Dr. Jonas Salk!)\n\nMilken continues:\n\nThanks to medical research on all diseases\u2026we live longer, more active lives with fewer years of disability. In economic terms, improvements in life expectancy added approximately $3.2 trillion per year to America\u2019s wealth over the three decades beginning in 1970, according to University of Chicago economists Kevin Murphy and Robert Topel.\n\nWow, did those economists really say that better health has added more than $3 trillion a year to the economy? That\u2019s real money!\n\nYes, it\u2019s strange that so many articles get written about \u201chealthcare policy\u201d that don\u2019t mention the actual stuff of health\u2014whether or not we have a cure for the maladies we face. And it\u2019s even stranger that wonky policy-papers and whole books get written on health policy, and yet never mention the dread diseases that afflict us, and cost a lot of money. For example, we have no real treatment for Alzheimer\u2019s, a disease which, as we have seen, costs us as a country well over $200 billion a year. So one might expect that the think tanks would be hard at work with thoughts on policies aimed at developing a cure for AD, or at least a good treatment. But in fact, we get mostly silence, as the DC think-tank class prefers to argue about financial mechanisms. After all, finance is what the nerd-class in DC knows, so of course that\u2019s what they want to to talk about. As the Talmud tells us, You see the world as you are.\n\nSo no wonder we are losing the battle against healthcare costs. To pursue our Clausewitzian grand-strategic analogy, it\u2019s as if we had waged WW2 against Bulgaria and Manchukuo, while ignoring Germany and Japan. Or it\u2019s if we waged the Cold War against Poland\u2014not the Soviet Union.\n\nYes, health insurance is important, but health itself is more important. So as strategists, if we are to be effective, we have to properly define the objective. The objective should be to do to Alzheimer\u2019s, for example, what we did to polio\u2014make it go away.\n\nAnd the funny thing is: Ordinary people understand this; only the healthcare experts seem not to get it.\n\nTo illustrate, when you\u2014or any other real person\u2014goes to the doctor with a complaint, the first words out of your mouth are likely to be about the lump or the pain or about the dread you might have about the disease that killed your relatives. Questions of finance come later.\n\nYes, it\u2019s a war\u2014diseases are, in the most literal sense, trying to kill us. And our survival matters more to us than money.\n\nOnly in the ivory tower imaginings of DC policy wonks is healthcare an abstract intellectual or ideological exercise about the budget, as opposed to what it really is to real people: a fight of flesh and blood.\n\nI would venture that no real person\u2014not even the most loyal liberal\u2014goes to the doctor with a serious complaint and says, \u201cDoc, whatever you do, don\u2019t spend too much; you must help me follow President Obama\u2019s injunction to bend down the curve of healthcare costs.\u201d And similarly, no real person\u2014not even a deep-red conservative\u2014says, \u201cDoc, please use my treatment to help vindicate the free-market theories of Friedrich Hayek and Ayn Rand.\u201d Instead, the more serious the disease, the more likely we are to speak in martial, militaristic, war-like terms.\n\nAnd so if, God forbid, we get cancer, we don\u2019t say, in bland bureaucratese, \u201cI am consuming oncological services.\u201d Instead, we say, with no small amount of vigor, \u201cI will beat this cancer.\u201d Or even, \u201cI will kill this cancer.\u201d Yes, that\u2019s how real people talk. And that\u2019s good! Any doctor will tell you that patients with a fighting spirit live longer.\n\nSo here\u2019s the essence of the Cure Strategy: Let\u2019s make sure that the system\u2014public, private, everything\u2014approaches serious illness the way real people approach it: Again, as a war.\n\nAs for me, I\u2019m glad that President Richard Nixon launched a \u201cwar on cancer\u201d back in 1971, and I\u2019ll bet you are, too. I\u2019m delighted to note that the death rate for cancer has fallen substantially since then. Thanks to the War on Cancer in the 1970s, we have cut the death rate from cancer by 40%\u2014you can look it up. Yes, plenty of people still die of cancer, but that\u2019s because they\u2019re living longer, because they\u2019re not dying of, for example, heart disease the way they used to since we dramatically cut the incidence of heart disease thanks to the combination of aspirin, fish oil, garlic and statin drugs\u2014a process smartened up and speeded up by Big Data.\n\nIn fact, some of the top leaders in medicine today, such as Dr. Robert Gallo, the co-discoverer of the AIDS virus in the 80s\u2014which is to say, the discovery that made effective treatment against AIDS possible\u2014will tell you that Nixon\u2019s \u201cwar on cancer\u201d was the foundation of their scientific success. It was at the Nixon-strengthened National Cancer Institute that young Bob Gallo first became familiar with the category of viruses known as retroviruses, of which HIV/AIDS is one.\n\nAnd now, of course, we are in new and costly struggles, against, for example, the Ebola virus. Our goal, of course, should not be to finance Ebola care, it should be destroy the Ebola contagion. Until we do, we simply aren\u2019t safe.\n\nAnd as we think about the enormous expense we saw mounted to keep Ebola from infecting the general population last years, we are reminded that the only cost-effective goal\u2014that is, the only goal that truly makes sense\u2014is victory against the actual disease. Yes, in Clausewitzian terms, a decisive victory against a disease is much cheaper and better than a protracted defeat, no matter how inexpensively it is waged. In healthcare, winning is always cheaper than losing.\n\nSo the Cure Strategy can also be called the Medical Victory Strategy.\n\nIn the 20th century, back in the 50s, the world set out to eradicate\u2014that is, destroy, annihilate\u2014smallpox. And we did. One of the great plagues of world history was finally done away with in 1980, officially declared planetarily eradicated by the World Health Organization. And so not only has nobody suffered from smallpox since, anywhere in the world, but we haven\u2019t spent a penny. So again, good strategy is not only humanitarian, but also a money-saver.\n\nMore recently, in 2012, then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said that she looked forward to a world without AIDS. That\u2019s a great goal! And so why not, now, also, a generation without cancer? Or without Alzheimer\u2019s? Those are great goals, too.\n\nII. Size Matters: Big Data, the Bigger the Better\n\nAnd as the overall outlines of a better grand strategy for health\u2014namely, cure the disease!\u2014come into focus, there\u2019s a reality that we need to bear in mind: To be blunt and crude about it, as I wrote earlier this month, Size Matters. It\u2019s Big Data\u2014the bigger the better\u2014that enables modern medicine to advance.\n\nAnd this is a point understood by Clausewitz and every other smart strategist in history: At the moment of impact, it always helps to have a greater force than the enemy. Even great generals, such as Robert E. Lee, who were usually outnumbered in the battles they fought, nevertheless arranged their forces to hit the enemy in a weak spot and hit him with a decisive force. Once again, Size Matters.\n\nNow as it happens, these days there\u2019s a line of thinking on the right which holds that big systems are inherently liberal and to be avoided; you know, like the federal government. And yes, today\u2019s federal government is liberal, and that\u2019s to be fixed. Because big things don\u2019t have to be liberal.\n\nThe Roman Empire wasn\u2019t liberal. And speaking of non-liberals who nonetheless wanted to make sure they could win, President George Washington told his fellow citizens that they must always stay together, lest they become divided and lose their freedom, perhaps to one of the European powers. As our First President put it, \u201cThe name of American, which belongs to you, in your national capacity must always exalt the just pride of Patriotism, more than any appellation derived from local discriminations.\u201d\n\nMore recently, another conservative made the same point about the value of bigness. In 2013, Lincoln scholar Lew Lehrman\u2014those with long memories might recall that Lehrman was the Republican nominee for governor of New York in 1982, running on an unabashed tax-cutting supply-side conservative platform; in a terrible year for the GOP, Lehrman came close to defeating Mario Cuomo\u2014argued that our Sixteenth President not only transformed American history but also enabled the United States to prevail against every foe of the twentieth century:\n\nWithout his leadership and resolve, separate slave and free countries might have competed as neighbors on the same continent. Thus, there might have been no integrated, continental American economy, and without a united industrial power, the means would not have existed to contain Imperial Germany as it reached for European hegemony in 1914. Neither would there have been a national power strong enough to destroy Hitler\u2019s Nazi Reich, nor to crush the aggressions of imperial Japan.\n\nSo for these reasons alone, Lincoln deserves our admiration.\n\nIn World War Two, we were blessed with great generals and brave soldiers. But unfortunately, the enemy had great generals and brave soldiers, too, even if they were fighting for an evil cause.\n\nAnd so how did we win? We won because we kept focused on the real enemy, as noted earlier, but we were also strong enough to win.\n\nAs one historian of World War Two noted, the \u201cBig L\u201d\u2014Logistics\u2014was a key to our victory.\n\nA remark by a captured German soldier best summarizes the importance of logistics in the battle for Europe in World War II. As he was marched past one of the many roadside supply dumps that dotted the Normandy landscape in the wake of the invasion, he was heard to remark \u201cI know how you defeated us. You piled up the supplies and then let them fall on us.\u201d He was right. The war in Europe was what the Germans called materialschlact, \u201cmat\u00e9riel battle.\u201d It was a \u201cmat\u00e9riel battle\u201d on a scale greater than any other conflict in history, a contest pitting the industrial capacities of Germany and the United States against each other. In the end, triumph was the result of the ability, of the United States to mobilize its industrial capacity\u201d to provide the instruments of war for its troops and those of its allies and to deliver them where and when they were needed\u2013to pile them up and let them fall.\n\nWe might note that the alternative to unity and bigness is not very attractive. As the tough-minded conservative philosopher Thomas Hobbes declared back in the 17th century, life in isolation is \u201csolitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.\u201d\n\nSo we can see: The challenge to conservatives today is not to secede, or otherwise hide, from the United States; instead, the challenge is reclaim our bigness and tilt it, once again, to the right. And one of the arguments for a right-wing takeover is, yes, the acceleration of cures. We can note the drying up of the medical-cures pipeline under Obama. In particular, we can ask, is it really a good idea that we are in the post-antibiotic era?\n\nIn the game of piling up Big Data for big breakthroughs, it helps a lot, as Donald Trump would say, for the system to be \u201cyuge.\u201d\n\nAs an aside, I would say to those who are absolutely determined to find personal freedom in the crowded world of the Third Millennium, you might take the advice of Robert A. Heinlein, and go to space. And this conservative with a libertarian streak will support your efforts to carve out a libertarian Shangri-la on Luna.\n\nIII. Brains Matter More than Size\n\nHere we might clarify: size matters, in terms of achieving industrial scale, but in the end, what matters more is brains. Just as armies with better weapons and training tend to do better in battle, so, too, with the logic and architecture of our Cure Strategy\u2014the smarter we are, the more likely we are to beat disease.\n\nAnd we can start with a political point: In 2015 and beyond, are we Republicans wiser to attack the Democrats on Obamacare because it has covered 15 million more people? Do we really think more people being covered is the Achilles Heel of Obamacare?\n\nThis old Reaganite remembers Ronald Reagan speaking at the Republican convention in 1980, that year, saying, \u201cOur message will be: we have to move ahead, but we\u2019re not going to leave anyone behind\u201d That\u2019s not only good Judeo-Christian thinking, it\u2019s also good politics. And, as a practical matter, in a world of AIDS and Ebola, it\u2019s good money-saving health strategy.\n\nIn the words of Rep. Fred Upton, the chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, who has successfully pushed a Cure Strategy bill through the House,\u201cWe have all said too many early good-byes to people we love and treasure. Every single person has a common goal: we want more time with those we love.\u201d Amen!\n\nSo yes, brains matter, but so does heart. If we want cures for ourselves, we had better find a way to make sure that those same cures are offered to everyone. And especially with Big Data, as I argued earlier, the goal of universal cures is cheaper than ever. That\u2019s good politics, for sure. It\u2019s also, of course, good theology. And since we are all going to die eventually, we might as well have a good plan for going to heaven.", "article_metadata": {"description": "As I seek to develop my ideas of a Cure Strategy against disease, it has come to my attention that many Breitbart readers regard my vision or healthcare abundance as liberal.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "As I seek to develop my ideas of a Cure Strategy against disease, it has come to my attention that many Breitbart readers regard my vision or healthcare abundance as liberal.", "title": "A New Grand Strategy in the War Against Disease \u2013 VICTORY! - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/03/ebola-hospital-AP.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/08/22/a-new-grand-strategy-in-the-war-against-disease-victory/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "As I seek to develop my ideas of a Cure Strategy against disease, it has come to my attention that many Breitbart readers regard my vision or healthcare abundance as liberal.", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/03/ebola-hospital-AP.jpg", "title": "A New Grand Strategy in the War Against Disease \u2013 VICTORY! - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": ",Big Government, Medicine,disease", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "published_time": "2015-08-22T06:19:32-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,Medicine"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "In fact, I\u2019ll go further: I think our national strategy should be to cure disease\u2014the Cure Strategy.\nSo the Cure Strategy can also be called the Medical Victory Strategy.\nAs one historian of World War Two noted, the \u201cBig L\u201d\u2014Logistics\u2014was a key to our victory.\nSo if we apply Clausewitz to the issues of US grand strategy in World War Two, for example, we can see that America was wise to focus on Hitler\u2019s Germany.\nA remark by a captured German soldier best summarizes the importance of logistics in the battle for Europe in World War II."}
