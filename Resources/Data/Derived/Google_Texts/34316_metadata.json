Asked whether he supports mandates on the American people, Trump jumped in, cutting off Fox New host Sean Hannity to say, \"No, I don\u2019t support them.\"\n\nLess than a week ago, however, Trump felt very differently. Asked by CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper about what would happen to the insurance market without the law\u2019s health insurance requirement, Trump said, \"Well I like the mandate.\"\n\nLast night's response was a follow-up on an early flip-flop, tweeting last week that he would \"repeal all of #Obamacare, including the mandate, period.\"\n\nThe best way to understand this rapid change is not as a meaningful shift from one position to another. It\u2019s better viewed as an admission that he has no coherent position at all, and that the underlying policy details are utterly irrelevant to him.\n\nThis is always the case when Trump talks about health care. Figuring out what his actual policy preferences are is essentially impossible, and if you try to take all of his statements together, in some sort of context, you end up with what Philip Klein of The Washington Examiner recently described as a mix of \"incoherence and socialism.\"\n\nTrump has variously supported replacing Obamacare with a free-market system, covering everyone through a system paid for by the government, providing care to people using \u201cthe concepts of Medicare,\u201d allowing the government to use its buying power to negotiate with drug companies, instituting an ill-defined competitive bidding process even though one already exists in Medicare, and\u2014if you are inclined to be generous\u2014vague support for allowing insurance to be purchased across state lines. (\u201cWe're going to take the lines out of play.\u201d)\n\nEven when he gestures towards a real policy idea, he does so in ways that suggest that not only does he not really understand the idea, he does not care to understand it. The details are irrelevant. If anything, displaying an understanding of the details might suggest that Trump had become too caught up in the compromises of governance that he claims he will be able to overcome as president.\n\nThe most consistent refrain in Trump\u2019s answers to health care is his declaration that \"we\u2019re not going to have people dying in the streets,\" a line he sometimes repeats multiple times in a single response, as if America\u2019s streets were strewn with dead corpses. The line, of course, is not responsive to questions about how, exactly, he would replace Obamacare, or to any meaningful aspect of national health care policy. At best, it is reference to ensuring that people who cannot pay still have access to emergency care. But Trump\u2019s plan for what to do with people in such situations\u2014\"we're going to get them into a hospital and take care of them\"\u2014ignores that since 1986 the United States has required hospitals to take people regardless of whether or not they can pay, via the Emergency Medical Treatment & Labor Act. If he is proposing a policy, it is one that already exists.\n\nBut Trump is not really proposing policy, because for both him and his supporters, policy is utterly beside the point. Nothing that Trump says about health care or any other policy, from taxes to abortion to deportation, even when he seems to venture near to something resembling a policy idea, should be taken seriously as a policy proposal. Instead his words should be understood as expressive statements meant to reflect some broad sentiment that plays well with his supporters rather than descriptions of actual plans he intends to put in place.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "His flip-flop on Obamacare's individual mandate is an admission that policy details don't matter.", "title": "Donald Trump Is Totally Incoherent On Health Care Policy Because Policy Is Irrelevant to His Campaign", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2016/02/23/donald-trump-incoherent-obamacare", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14562456963218.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "His flip-flop on Obamacare's individual mandate is an admission that policy details don't matter.", "title": "Donald Trump Is Totally Incoherent On Health Care Policy Because Policy Is Irrelevant to His Campaign", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14562456963218.jpg", "creator": "@petersuderman", "site": "@reason", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "article": {"tag": "HomePage", "published_time": "2016-02-23T16:36:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/peter-suderman"}, "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "article_summary": "Donald Trump made it very clear last night that he does not support Obamacare\u2019s individual mandate to purchase health insurance.\nAsked by CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper about what would happen to the insurance market without the law\u2019s health insurance requirement, Trump said, \"Well I like the mandate.\"\nThe line, of course, is not responsive to questions about how, exactly, he would replace Obamacare, or to any meaningful aspect of national health care policy.\nThis is always the case when Trump talks about health care.\nNothing that Trump says about health care or any other policy, from taxes to abortion to deportation, even when he seems to venture near to something resembling a policy idea, should be taken seriously as a policy proposal."}
