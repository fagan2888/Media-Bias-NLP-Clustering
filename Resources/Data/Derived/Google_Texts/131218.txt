Jeremy Foster, one of two men charged in the Tulsa Best Buy murders, entered a guilty plea Tuesday to being an accessory in the crime. This takes place a day after convicted murderer Willie Wise was sentenced to two life terms in prison in the shootings.

In the plea deal, Foster was sentenced to 40 years on each count of accessory to murder. The sentences will run concurrently.



Detectives have long said that Foster drove the getaway car that took Wise to the midtown store where Wise shot and killed Scott Norman.

Wesley Brown, who was shopping with his daughter that day, was struck and killed by a stray bullet.

Although they say the sentences are fair, family members say there will always be the pain of losing someone they love.

"We miss my brother very much, and nothing can ever fill the hole that is left by his presence and his love and everything he did for us," said Gracelyn Brown, Wesley Brown's sister.

Charges were dropped against a third person initially charged in the murders, Foster's cousin Shania Craven. Craven testified that the three were at Promenade Mall earlier that Saturday when she heard Wise tell her cousin that Norman was going to the Best Buy.

She also testified that the three of them drove to Skelly Drive where they parked by the side of the Best Buy building.

Wise exited the car then came back a short time later saying that he "got him," that he shot Scott Norman several times, Craven said.
