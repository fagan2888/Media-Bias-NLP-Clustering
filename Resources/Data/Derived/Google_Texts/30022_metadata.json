The report also said expanding the service would undo whatever economic progress Tennessee has made since the national economy almost collapsed six years ago.\n\nBeacon Center spokesman Mark Cunningham said the nonprofit is prepared for the fight.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t believe that this expansion is going to help anybody. We think it doesn\u2019t help the health care problem. It just makes it worse,\u201d Cunningham said. \u201cInstead of fixing the system through privatization or something else we are expanding a system that is broken. We will fight it, as we think it is really, really bad for the taxpayers of Tennessee.\u201d\n\nDespite gearing for a fight, Democrats in both the Tennessee Senate and House are expected to have even less influence than before.\n\nThe Tennessee Senate is currently composed of 26 Republicans and seven Democrats. Senate Republicans picked up two additional seats this year, meaning they now represent all of Tennessee\u2019s 95 counties, said Senate Republican Caucus spokeswoman Darlene Schlicher.\n\n\u201cThe five remaining Democrats are from two counties, Davidson and Shelby, which are also shared with Republican senators,\u201d Schlicher said.\n\nTennessee House Republicans also picked up two additional seats, giving them a majority of 73 Republicans over 26 Democrats, said House Republican Caucus spokesman Cade Cothren.\n\nCothren said he had no specifics on House Republicans\u2019 planned agenda.\n\n\u201cObviously it is tough to get into too many specifics with the session still on the horizon and the bill filing deadline a couple of months away,\u201d Cothren said.\n\nCothren did say, however, that House Republicans are likely to work on more tax cuts and avoid tax increases altogether. Cothren also said the State House will examine Tennessee\u2019s educational standards, although he didn\u2019t offer specifics or if that involves school choice.\n\nThe Beacon Center, which advocated school choice in prior legislative sessions, will also pursue the matter in 2015, Cunningham said, specifically a bill that gives vouchers to 5,000 low-income students in failing school districts.\n\n\u201cWe came one vote short during the last legislative session of getting a bill passed that we thought would help a lot of children across Tennessee,\u201d Cunningham said.\n\nSome Democrats support the legislation, while some Republicans don\u2019t, Cunningham said.\n\n\u201cWith one vote away we are confident that we will get something passed this session, probably something that looks similar to what was brought up last session. Just one more vote is totally doable this session.\u201d\n\nSchlicher told Tennessee Watchdog that Republicans in the State Senate plan to address the issue of the Hall Income Tax, which, as previously reported, is a 6 percent income tax on dividends from stocks and interest on certain bonds.\n\nState officials enacted the Hall Income Tax in 1929, according to the state\u2019s official website.\n\nContact Christopher Butler at chris@tennesseewatchdog.org\n\nFollow Tennessee Watchdog and receive regular updates through Facebook and Twitter\n\nLike Watchdog.org?
