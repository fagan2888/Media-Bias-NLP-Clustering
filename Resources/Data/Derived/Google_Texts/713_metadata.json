If she is to make her tri-centennial in 2076, a feat few great nations in history have achieved, it will need to crush this totalitarian ideology that is currently strangling it.\n\nEvery problem in America today is linked to political correctness. Declining educational standards, increasing secularism, the police not being allowed to do their job, an inability to secure her borders, a diminished America in the world theatre and reluctance to smash the evil of currently rampaging Islamism \u2013 all of it is rooted in politically-correct ideology. Nothing is more antithetical to America\u2019s foundational principles.\n\nPolitical correctness seeks to eliminate individualism, identity and confidence; three characteristics indispensable to American greatness. If you want to see the end result, look no further than Europe. The intellectual tyranny, self-loathing and choking conformity of this ideology has feminized and weakened a once great continent which now aspires to mediocrity. The same is true of America\u2019s English-speaking cousins.\n\nI write this not as an American.\n\nBut as somebody that wants Western civilization to prosper. Everyone has an investment in keeping the United States as culturally robust and powerful as imaginable, because the world\u2019s fortunes travel with it. What is good for America is good for the world.\n\nI am here to tell you I\u2019ve lived your future, if you keep going, you\u2019re not going to like it. It\u2019s why I\u2019ve written \u201cRetaking America: Crushing Political Correctness\u201d.\n\nThe entire world looks on as Americans make their choice for president. The president of the United States is also the president of the free world. All of us have a stake. For example, people in Australia aren\u2019t sleeping well right now because President Obama is not keeping the world safe. Change can\u2019t come quickly enough for many around the world.\n\nThe world needs an American president that is clear-minded and right-thinking. That encourages a climate of straight talking and decisive action. That has the moral clarity to defend Christians and the West. An alpha male prepared to win for his people.\n\nPeople are losing their jobs, missing out on opportunities and being targeted. What was born on college campuses has been armed through social media by electronic cockroaches that should never have been given a voice. The parameters of public debate have shrunk, and civil society\u2019s ability to conduct rational, cool-headed conversations is being usurped by a crude marketplace of outrage and a new victimhood movement. Freedom is an obvious casualty of political correctness, but following close behind is truth and reality.\n\nMany people around the world despair. But every now and again, a public figure emerges who transcends politics and has an undisputed ability to change the culture.\n\nThis is why the world needs to use its Trump card. He is uniquely positioned to change the culture of the world, and restore American greatness and Western confidence through attitude alone.\n\nA President Trump would be the best thing, not only for America, but for the entire world.\n\nProud, confident, bold, patriotic, outspoken, self-reliant, mega-successful, charitable, a force of nature; Donald Trump is American exceptionalism on steroids.\n\nFor too long, America\u2019s educational and media elites have relentlessly and recklessly portrayed America as a hateful place. It\u2019s not. It\u2019s the greatest country in this history of the world. But political correctness is giving it an identity crisis. Some may well call Donald Trump an egomaniac and his election to the highest office, risky \u2013 but right now, America needs an ego-boost. It needs to believe in itself again. Only then can there be an American renaissance.\n\nA Trump presidency won\u2019t only wipe out political correctness in America; it\u2019ll wipe it off the face of the earth.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Political correctness is destroying America, and Western civilization..05/27/2016 9:06:53AM EST.", "author": "Nick Adams", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Political correctness is destroying America, and Western civilization.", "title": "Nick Adams - Political Correctness \u2013 The Reason The World Needs To Use Its Trump Card", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/nickadams/2016/02/23/political-correctness--the-reason-the-world-needs-to-use-its-trump-card-n2123764", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/54/2016-02-23T160247Z_2_LYNXNPEC1M0GC_RTROPTP_3_USA-ELECTION-TRUMP.JPG", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Political correctness is destroying America, and Western civilization.", "title": "Nick Adams - Political Correctness \u2013 The Reason The World Needs To Use Its Trump Card", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/nickadams/2016/02/23/political-correctness--the-reason-the-world-needs-to-use-its-trump-card-n2123764", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/54/2016-02-23T160247Z_2_LYNXNPEC1M0GC_RTROPTP_3_USA-ELECTION-TRUMP.JPG", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Political Correctness \u2013 The Reason The World Needs To Use Its Trump Card, Nick Adams, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "A Trump presidency won\u2019t only wipe out political correctness in America; it\u2019ll wipe it off the face of the earth.\nFreedom is an obvious casualty of political correctness, but following close behind is truth and reality.\nThis is why the world needs to use its Trump card.\nThe world needs an American president that is clear-minded and right-thinking.\nPolitical correctness seeks to eliminate individualism, identity and confidence; three characteristics indispensable to American greatness."}
