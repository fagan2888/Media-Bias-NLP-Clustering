A man suspected of carjacking two vehicles and twice firing at Topeka police is shot by officers after he rammed two cars.

The Topeka Capital-Journal reports the suspect was taken to an area hospital with gunshot wounds, but authorities haven't released his name, age or medical condition.

Police Chief James Brown says officers responded to the first carjacking at 9:24 p.m. Friday near a Hy-Vee parking lot. The suspect was gone but was seen driving erratically half an hour later before he lost control and crashed.

Brown says the man started shooting at officers before carjacking a second vehicle.

He was spotted driving a short time later at Interstate 70 and Wanamaker Road, where he rammed two cars and fired again at police before being shot by officers.
