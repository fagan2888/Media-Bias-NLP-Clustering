Any public fight over legislative compromises could take away from the focus Republicans have kept on the health care law.\n\n\u201cI ran on a government that did less,\u201d said Representative Reid Ribble, Republican of Wisconsin. \u201cI felt the government was overreaching, and the citizens that sent me didn\u2019t want me to be overaggressive in writing new laws. The Affordable Care Act launch is actually demonstrating the ineptitude of the federal government in handling these big programs.\u201d\n\nThe 113th Congress has passed all of 55 laws so far this year, seven fewer at this point than the 112th Congress \u2014 the least productive Congress ever. House and Senate negotiators will meet on Wednesday to try to come to terms on a farm bill, but they remain far apart, especially on food-stamp cuts that the House is demanding. The leaders of the House and Senate budget committees will also meet this week, and they appear to be closing in on a modest deal that would set spending levels for the next two years while relieving some of the pain from the across-the-board spending cuts known as sequestration.\n\nIn the meantime, the House is set to pass legislation on Tuesday to mandate that loose change left at airport security checkpoints be given to airport \u201cplaces of rest and recuperation\u201d for members of the armed forces. The real action will be off the House floor \u2014 four different hearings in four different committees on the Affordable Care Act.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThat contrast \u2014 between tamping down expectations for legislative accomplishments and raising hopes of more health care fireworks \u2014 has dominated Congress for more than a month.\n\n\u201cRepublicans are using their political attacks on the Affordable Care Act as cover to do nothing else,\u201d said Representative Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, the senior Democrat on the House Budget Committee.",
