The economy expands and as a result you\u2019re going to have more employees because businesses have to. But you can ask any employer in America and ask them if Obamacare has made it harder to hire employees because it\u2019s a fact. Um, yeah. Do you know why there\u2019re more people insured? Because a lot more people are on Medicaid, and you know giving people Medicaid insurance is almost like giving them nothing. Because there aren\u2019t, you can\u2019t find a doctor that will see Medicaid patients, and so where do they end up? In the same place, they used to end up, in the emergency room.\u201d\n\nTodd weakly asked, \u201cSo you don\u2019t see Obamacare as good for the country?\u201d\n\nIf Chuck Todd had done even the most basic research, he would have known that Speaker Boehner was lying. Boehner\u2019s claim that the numbers of insured Americans is so high because of the Medicaid expansion alone was false. A Kaiser Family Foundation study found, \u201cThe survey finds that nearly six in ten of those now covered by Exchange plans were uninsured prior to signing up. The previously uninsured are one of the groups most likely to believe they have benefited from the ACA, and seven in ten of them say they would not have gotten coverage without the law.\u201d\n\nBoehner\u2019s other claim that employers all say that Obamacare has made hiring more difficult was also not true. A poll by the National Association of Business Economics (NABE) that surveyed four sectors of the economy found that seventy-five percent of business owners said that the ACA has not impacted their hiring practices. An additional 85% said that they didn\u2019t expect the ACA to impact their hiring practices in the future.\n\nNBC\u2019s Chuck Todd should not have let Speaker Boehner put these lies out there unchallenged. Todd\u2019s lay down and die brand of journalism is the reason so many Americans don\u2019t trust the mainstream press and don\u2019t bother to tune into the Sunday morning shows.\n\nJohn Boehner can\u2019t defend his desire to repeal Obamacare, so he had to lie in order to justify taking away health insurance from tens of millions of Americans. Chuck Todd does not believe that he has a responsibility to call out conservative lies, and his willingness to let Boehner\u2019s lies slide typify his consistent enabling of Republican falsehoods.", "article_metadata": {"description": "NBC's Chuck Todd continued to be the Republican Party's best friend by letting John Boehner tell two gigantic lies about the ACA on Meet The Press.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Jason Easley", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "NBC's Chuck Todd continued to be the Republican Party's best friend by letting John Boehner tell two gigantic lies about the ACA on Meet The Press.", "title": "Chuck Todd Lets John Boehner Tell Blatant Obamacare Lies On Meet The Press", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2015/05/03/chuck-todd-lets-john-boehner-blatant-obamacare-lies-meet-press.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/todd-boehner-mtp.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-05-03T19:40:56+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "Editors' Picks,Featured News,Issues,chuck todd,John Boehner,meet the press,obamacare lies,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,barack obama,hillary clinton,bernie sanders,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "Issues", "published_time": "2015-05-03T19:40:56+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-03T19:40:56+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "chuck todd, John Boehner, meet the press, obamacare lies"}, "article_summary": "NBC\u2019s Chuck Todd continued to be the Republican Party\u2019s best friend by letting John Boehner tell two gigantic lies about the ACA on Meet The Press.\nNBC\u2019s Chuck Todd should not have let Speaker Boehner put these lies out there unchallenged.\nVideo:Chuck Todd confronted Boehner about his wrong Obamacare predictions that fewer people would have health care under the ACA and that Obamacare would kill jobs.\nChuck Todd does not believe that he has a responsibility to call out conservative lies, and his willingness to let Boehner\u2019s lies slide typify his consistent enabling of Republican falsehoods.\nTodd\u2019s lay down and die brand of journalism is the reason so many Americans don\u2019t trust the mainstream press and don\u2019t bother to tune into the Sunday morning shows."}
