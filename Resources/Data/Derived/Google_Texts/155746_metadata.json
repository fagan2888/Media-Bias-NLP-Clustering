In the same state, a Mountain West Medical Center nurse regularly stole liquid opioids and another nurse was caught with drug paraphernalia in her locker after her employer noticed she was pulling narcotics with much more frequency than her co-workers.\n\nNor is the problem restricted to Utah, Christine Nefcy, chief medical officer at McKay-Dee Hospital in Ogden, told the publication. The drug abuse problem is nationwide, she said, and \"hospital personnel, hospital employees aren't any different.\" Last year a federal judge in New Hampshire sentenced hospital technician David Kwiatowski, to 39 years in prison after he infected at least 46 patients with hepatitis after injecting himself with patients' pain medicine and refilling the syringes with saline.\n\nJohn Eddington, an agent with Salt Lake City's Drug Enforcement Administration office, said the problem of drug theft, or diversion, by healthcare workers has worsened in recent years. Part of what makes the problem particularly bad for these workers is the sheer number of ways they can accomplish the thefts, from pharmacists forging prescriptions to nurses covertly pocketing pills to providers tampering with vials or syringes and potentially exposing their patients to blood-borne diseases.\n\nFar too often, according to the article, these problems persist due to providers dealing with them internally and failing to report the theft to law enforcement, due in large part to privacy concerns. In states such as Virginia, employers often fail to report such thefts, and laws imposing fines for failure to report are essentially unenforceable, FierceHealthcare previously reported.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read the article\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nWhen hospital safeguards against drug theft aren't enough\n\nHow Virginia employers enable nurse drug theft\n\nRehab programs let addicted nurses seek help, keep jobs\n\nSafety experts: Hospitals lacking in doc substance abuse policies\n\n3 signs healthcare workers abuse drugs\n\nHospital setting triggers worker drug abuse, theft\n\nShould all docs and nurses receive drug tests after adverse events?\n\nDevelop policies to handle doc impairment--before you need them", "article_metadata": {"description": "Healthcare providers are under increased pressure to take serious action against employee drug theft, according to the Deseret News, especially after the revelation that it may have led to nearly 5,000 patients in a Utah hospital being exposed to hepatitis C.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Healthcare providers are under increased pressure to take serious action against employee drug theft, according to the Deseret News, especially after the revelation that it may have led to nearly 5,000 patients in a Utah hospital being exposed to hepatitis C.", "title": "Worsening drug theft by healthcare workers puts patients at risk", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/worsening-drug-theft-healthcare-workers-puts-patient-risk/2015-11-09", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Care Delivery,drug diversion,drug theft,Legal / Regulatory / Risk Management,Operations & Business Management,opioid abuse,patient safety,substance abuse", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Legal / Regulatory / Risk Management,Operations & Business Management"}, "article_summary": "John Eddington, an agent with Salt Lake City's Drug Enforcement Administration office, said the problem of drug theft, or diversion, by healthcare workers has worsened in recent years.\nThe drug abuse problem is nationwide, she said, and \"hospital personnel, hospital employees aren't any different.\"\nTo learn more:- read the articleRelated Articles:When hospital safeguards against drug theft aren't enoughHow Virginia employers enable nurse drug theftRehab programs let addicted nurses seek help, keep jobsSafety experts: Hospitals lacking in doc substance abuse policies3 signs healthcare workers abuse drugsHospital setting triggers worker drug abuse, theftShould all docs and nurses receive drug tests after adverse events?\nNor is the problem restricted to Utah, Christine Nefcy, chief medical officer at McKay-Dee Hospital in Ogden, told the publication.\nIn states such as Virginia, employers often fail to report such thefts, and laws imposing fines for failure to report are essentially unenforceable, FierceHealthcare previously reported."}
