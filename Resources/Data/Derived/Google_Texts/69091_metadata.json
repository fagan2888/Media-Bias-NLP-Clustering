Because of this\u2014and only because of this, I\u2019d guess\u2014we now have Horrible Bosses 2. The first film, lit up by the comic chemistry of Jason Bateman, Jason Sudeikis and Charlie Day, was very funny. It had a tight, lightweight script and prime support by Kevin Spacey and (especially) Jennifer Aniston as two of the awful bosses. They\u2019re all back for the sequel, and they\u2019re all fine\u2014or as fine as the rickety script will allow them to be. But the premise is already played out, and the scattershot fun is strained.\n\nThe story naturally picks up from the end of the first movie. Nick (Bateman), Kurt (Sudeikis), and Dale (Day), now liberated from their oppressive employers, are striking out on their own. In search of financial backing to manufacture a bathroom gadget they\u2019ve invented\u2014the Shower Buddy\u2014they approach a marketing mogul named Hanson (Christoph Waltz). Hanson agrees to fund the creation of their new company and also places a huge initial order for their dopey product. But then he turns around and screws them, leaving the guys swamped in debt. Seeking counsel from their former \u201cmurder consultant,\u201d Motherfucker Jones (Jamie Foxx, also returning from the first film), the guys decide to kidnap Hanson\u2019s whack-job son, Rex (Chris Pine), and hold him for a substantial ransom that will bail out their fledgling business venture.\n\nIt\u2019s still a pleasure to watch Bateman, Sudeikis and Day playing off each other. They\u2019re so completely in sync, you keep hoping they\u2019ll goose the movie into takeoff. But the killer lines they\u2019ve been given here never quite kill\u2014they\u2019re often slightly askew. Preparing for a TV interview with two airhead morning-show hosts, Nick says, \u201cLet\u2019s not be ourselves. Ourselves is a dumpster fire.\u201d Later, when they\u2019re interviewing job applicants for their new company and Kurt keeps choosing hot chicks with otherwise blank resumes, he says, \u201cWhat\u2019s the point of being the boss if you can\u2019t stock the pond a little?\u201d\n\nThe funniest new addition to the cast is Pine, who has a vivid gift for halfwit comedy. (Rex wants to scam the Shower Buddy guys, but he turns out to be even stupider than they are.) And Foxx is still amusing in his peripheral thug role. (It turns out his Motherfucker Jones never actually murdered anyone\u2014he went down for pirating copies of Snow Falling on Cedars.)\n\nBut Waltz is wasted as the heartless Hanson\u2014he\u2019s too congenial to pass for sinister. And Spacey and Aniston are woefully underserved by the script (cowritten by new director Sean Anders, who also had a hand in Dumb and Dumber To). Spacey, as Nick\u2019s onetime boss Dave Harken, is given only a couple of pointless rants in a prison visiting room (he really did murder someone in the first film). And Aniston, as the nymphomaniac dentist Julia Harris, is marooned here. Last time out, with her slinky moves and dirty-girl wisecracks, she was a hilarious raunch goddess. Here she\u2019s saddled with an arsenal of overcooked trash talk that\u2019s too witless to be much fun. (\u201cI collect cocks,\u201d she says.)\n\nThere\u2019s no non-monetary reason for this picture to exist. It\u2019s padded and meandering, and there aren\u2019t even any horrible bosses in it. It\u2019s hard to imagine fans of the first movie not laughing a lot less at this one.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Jason Bateman and Jennifer Aniston succumb to sequelitis.", "title": "Horrible Bosses 2", "url": "http://reason.com/archives/2014/11/28/horrible-bosses-2", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14171394699532.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The original Horrible Bosses, released\nin 2011, grossed more than $200-million worldwide.
