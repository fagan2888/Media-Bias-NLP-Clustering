During \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d on Sunday, with the morning rain having passed, the cover was lifted and the sun suddenly shone on Kyle Kendrick.\n\nThe Rockies\u2019 veteran starter \u2014 a durable figure over eight seasons in Philadelphia but a beleaguered pitcher in purple \u2014 looked like himself again.\n\nKendrick gave up just three hits and two runs over five innings, leading the Rockies to a 3-2 victory over Seattle.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s always been a very durable guy,\u201d Rockies manager Walt Weiss said. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the reasons we got him. He can eat up innings.\u201d\n\nKendrick has started 20 or more games in seven of his nine big-league seasons. A shoulder injury last month sidelined him for the first time since 2011. Through 23 starts before Sunday, Kendrick struggled to a 5-12 record and a 6.25 ERA. He\u2019s a flyball pitcher throwing for a groundball team.\n\nBut away from Coors Field \u2014 where his numbers are considerably better \u2014 and back near where he played baseball at nearby Mount Vernon High in Washington, Kendrick seemed at ease.\n\n\u201cMy dad used to take me to games here as a kid,\u201d Kendrick said. \u201cComing here brought back those memories.\u201d\n\nHe faced the minimum number of batters through the first three innings. He struck out Nelson Cruz looking to end the first. He struck out Seth Smith with the bat still upright to end the second. And he whiffed James Jones without a swing to finish the third.\n\n\u201cIt looks like there\u2019s more finish to his pitches,\u201d Weiss said. \u201cHis fastball has more life. He\u2019s healthy and strong.\u201d\n\nLogan Morrison was the first Mariners hitter to reach base, in the third, after he bunted. But catcher Dustin Garneau threw him out trying to steal second.\n\nThe Mariners scored twice in the fourth when Smith looped a single to center field just shy of Charlie Blackmon\u2019s toes to score two. Kendrick left after the fifth with four strikeouts and two walks.\n\nKendrick threw 72 pitches \u2014 45 for strikes \u2014 with a mix of two-seam fastballs, changeups and sliders.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s funny. On the road, it should move more,\u201d Kendrick said. \u201cYou know Denver. This year, it hasn\u2019t moved as much as I\u2019m used to. But on the road, when I feel good, it\u2019s where it should be.\u201d\n\nThe Rockies took a 1-0 lead in the third on Nolan Arenado\u2019s sacrifice fly to right that scored Blackmon. Wilin Rosario and Justin Morneau hustled home to score on a throwing error in the fourth.\n\nIn the eighth, Rockies left fielder Brandon Barnes slammed his head into the dirt while making a diving catch down the left-field foul line off Kyle Seager\u2019s line drive. Barnes then slinged a relay throw to double off Ketel Marte from first.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to do everything I can for our pitchers,\u201d Barnes said.\n\nSaid Kendrick: \u201cIt saved the game for us. That got us a W.\u201d\n\nJohn Axford, against the meat of the Mariners\u2019 order, struck out Cruz to open the ninth, gave up a single through the middle to Robinson Cano, struck out Mark Trumbo and got Smith to pop out to center to save the game.\n\nThe Rockies (60-83) won just their fourth series since the all-star break.\n\nAnd Kendrick \u2014 a 31-year-old whom the Rockies signed to a one-year, $5.5 million contract before the season \u2014 is 2-0 with a 3.86 ERA in three starts since returning from injury.\n\n\u201cI feel a lot better. And when you feel good, you can make your pitches more consistently,\u201d Kendrick said. \u201cThat\u2019s a good thing for me going into the winter, to show teams I\u2019m healthy.\u201d\n\nNick Groke: ngroke@denverpost.com or twitter.com/nickgroke\n\nSteamrolled\n\nThe Rockies took two of three from the Mariners over the weekend to finish interleague play this year.
