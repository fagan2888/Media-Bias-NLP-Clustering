He came all the way from New Jersey to open the Georgia Republican Convention last Friday, and no one seems to care.\n\nThe buzz at the Classic Center is all about two other presidential candidates who may or may not make last-minute appearances, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee (neither shows up). Maybe no one\u2019s wide awake yet, but the response as Christie takes the stage is as lukewarm as the coffee.\n\nIt soon becomes clear why: While Christie says he \u201ccan\u2019t stand\u201d Democrats, much of his speech is about how he won them over and works with them. He ticks off a list of accomplishments as governor: Winning majorities among women and Hispanics (traditional Democratic constituencies), helping to elect 31 GOP governors as head of the Republican Governors Association (including Georgia\u2019s Nathan Deal), erasing an $11 billion deficit, eliminating more than 100 taxes and fees, vetoing Planned Parenthood funding and reducing the state payroll by 8,500. And he did it without \u201cthe luxury of a Republican legislature,\u201d he says, before zinging the all-or-nothing tea party.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t stand in the corner and hold your breath and wait for the world to turn,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to make the world turn.\u201d\n\nSix years after the tea party movement exploded and less than two years before a new president will take office, Republicans are still obsessed with taking down President Obama, but with the economy improving, they have less and less ammunition. \u201cThis president has led the most lifeless recovery in the post-World War II era,\u201d Christie says. \u201cPeople are saying, \u2018I know you\u2019ve created jobs, Mr. President. I have three of them.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe surest sign that Christie is auditioning for the job is that he\u2019s tackling foreign policy. It\u2019s all standard Fox News bluster: Obama is weak, which emboldens our enemies, and he\u2019s not a friend to Israel. He let Assad off the hook in Syria and Putin run wild. 9/11!\n\nPhoto Credit: Joshua L. Jones New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie speaks to reporters.\n\nChristie is facing scandal after scandal back home\u2014he spent an insane amount of taxpayer money ($82,000 over two seasons) on food and drinks at NFL games, and members of his staff might be indicted for misappropriating pension funds. From what I can hear stuck behind the TV reporters, though, no one is asking him about it. Instead, they\u2019re pressing him on whether he\u2019ll run for president. He\u2019s noncommittal.\n\nAnd he should be\u2014in Georgia, he\u2019s polling around 1 percent. The next presidential candidate to speak, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, is more viable, although he may have killed his chances when he briefly supported comprehensive immigration reform (read: \u201camnesty\u201d) before reversing himself.\n\nSpeaking in the Classic Center\u2019s half-empty Grand Hall, Rubio skirts the issue of immigration policy as he describes his upbringing as the son of Cuban immigrants. He is living the American Dream, but says the dream is dying. \u201cThere\u2019s no way my parents could live the lifestyle they did as a bartender and a maid in this new economy,\u201d he says.\n\nHis solutions are mainly warmed-over policies from the Reagan years, like lowering corporate taxes. I don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s because he\u2019s in a college town, but he spends a lot of time talking about vocational education and student debt, though he doesn\u2019t really offer many specific ideas. One is a \u201cright to know before you go\u201d law, which would require universities to tell student-loan borrowers how much money they can expect to make. \u201cSo you can decide whether it\u2019s worth it to borrow $50,000 to major in Greek philosophy, because the market for Greek philosophers has gotten very tight,\u201d Rubio says.\n\nThen he turns to foreign policy. Israel good; China, Russia and \u201cradical Islam\u201d bad. Like all the GOP presidential candidates, his philosophy is speak loudly and carry a big stick. Even the usually sedate Sen. Johnny Isakson gets into the act. \u201cThe only way to deal with ISIS is to kill \u2018em, and the quicker we do it, the better off we\u2019ll be,\u201d he says.\n\nFinally\u2014and remember this part, it\u2019ll come up again\u2014Rubio says that, as president, he\u2019ll appoint an attorney general who will \u201cdefend the religious liberties of every American to live our faith\u2026 not just at home or in church, but in our business, too.\u201d\n\nThe real rock star is Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, famed for reading Dr. Seuss on the Senate floor during a faux filibuster against raising the debt ceiling. As Rubio wraps up, Cruz is arriving. Fanboys quickly corner him as other delegates pose for photos in front of a Fox News truck outside.\n\nPhoto Credit: Joshua L. Jones Ted Cruz speaks to a voter before his speech Friday night.\n\nEarlier in the day, state party chairman John Padgett, a longtime Athens activist, had warned delegates that they\u2019re not exactly in friendly territory: \u201cYou are in a bastion of socialism, communism and Democrats. This is the only county in the state that voted for Dukakis, the only one. This is a hard place for Republicans to be.\u201d\n\nAnd Athens is proving Padgett right. About 150 people have gathered in front of the Classic Center to agitate for Medicaid expansion. (Georgia Republicans have turned down Affordable Care Act money to insure an estimated 650,000 Georgias.) \u201cThere are people dying every single day just because we\u2019re not expanding Medicaid,\u201d says Tim Denson of the progressive group Athens for Everyone.\n\nDenson and others march up and down Thomas Street, then go inside the building to deliver a box of letters. They\u2019re chanting \u201cSave Georgia lives!\u201d and the delegates are chanting back \u201cSave Georgia money!\u201d\n\n\u201cA lady got up in my face screaming, \u2018Get a job!\u2019\u201d says Athens-Clarke County Commissioner Melissa Link. \u201cI said \u2018I have one. I\u2019m doing it.\u2019\u201d\n\nAfter about 10 minutes, Classic Center staff and police ask the protesters to leave. The commotion dies down, and delegates start lining up outside the ballroom to hear Cruz\u2019s dinner speech.\n\nPhoto Credit: Joshua L. Jones Athens-Clarke County Commissioner Kelly Girtz speaks at a pro-Medicaid rally outside the Classic Center.\n\nPacing the stage with his sleeves rolled up, Cruz comes off as a cross between Jay Leno and a TV preacher. Everything has a punchline. He mentions that Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, the socialist Vermont senator, are running. \u201cRight now, the Democratic field includes a wild-eyed socialist with dangerous views on foreign policy\u2014and Bernie Sanders,\u201d he says. Cue the cymbal crash.\n\nCruz is by far the most extreme candidate we\u2019ve seen today, and of course, the crowd loves him for it. \u201cWe should adopt a simple flat tax,\u201d he says. \u201cLet every American fill out his or her taxes on a postcard. And when we do that, we should abolish the IRS.\n\n\u201cTake all 90,000 of them and put them on the southern border. I say that tongue in cheek, but imagine if you were swimming the Rio Grande, and the first thing you saw was 90,000 IRS agents. You\u2019d turn around and go home.\u201d Cruz, it should be noted, is of Cuban descent and was born in Canada.\n\nThere are two types of Republicans in this post-Obama world: Those who still believe he\u2019s a Muslim Kenyan usurper who is hell-bent on declaring martial law and locking up conservatives in concentration camps, and those who pander to them. When Cruz says we need to \u201crepeal every word of Obamacare\u201d and \u201crepeal every word of Common Core,\u201d you know that he knows that the Common Core curriculum isn\u2019t even a federal law, and that getting rid of health coverage for pre-existing conditions and tax deductions for mortgages and children would, in reality, be monumentally unpopular. Dude went to Harvard. He knows better, but he says it anyway, because it appeals to the kind of people who wear Benghazi pins, forward chain emails and spend two days at political conventions.\n\nCruz gets his biggest applause when he addresses the controversial \u201creligious liberty\u201d bill that, depending on whom you ask, may or may not protect Christians from having to sell flower arrangements to same-sex couples when Obummer institutes, as Cruz calls it, \u201cmandatory gay marriage.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will always, always, always defend the religious liberty of every American,\u201d he says.\n\nThe rumor is that the convention\u2019s 2,000 delegates will have a big fight on the floor over religious liberty. A committee has drafted a resolution calling on the legislature to pass a religious liberty without any protections against discrimination. It\u2019s a bill that House Speaker David Ralston, questioning the need for it, given the First Amendment, bottled up during the last session.\n\nSaturday, Ralston is booed. I wonder why.\n\nPhoto Credit: Joshua L. Jones Convention sponsor Clyde Armory displays rifles outside the Grand Hall.\n\nThroughout Saturday\u2019s session, speakers plead for party unity. To paraphrase Jeff Mangum, we know who our enemies are. \u201cNo matter what team you\u2019re on, I want you to go out and fight the Democrats and take back the United States of America,\u201d says former congressman Jack Kingston, who introduces Padgett.\n\nAfter a lunch of Chick-fil-A (what else?), it\u2019s time to elect party officials. Padgett and a slate of establishment candidates are running against a group of upstarts, mainly young libertarian-ish newcomers to the party. The paranoia about Obama and Democrats among Republicans also extends to each other. The upstarts accuse the establishment of using \u201cmafia-style\u201d tactics. There are references to Stalin and Star Chamber. One candidate for vice chairman makes a big deal about the incumbent not shaking his hand. Another says she\u2019ll do anything to fight Common Core, \u201ceven bake cupcakes.\u201d Delegates spend an hour arguing over whether to vote by secret ballot because of fears of intimidation; some delegates, though, are afraid their ballots will vanish unless they vote openly.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s 3:45 in the afternoon, and I would like to go home sometime before midnight,\u201d says one gentlemen. The question is called. Padgett and the establishment slate win handily. The promised fight over religious liberty never materializes\u2014all the resolutions are approved by voice vote. One takes aim at \u201cradically revisionist\u201d AP History; another calls for the state school board to be elected, rather than appointed, because members support Common Core. (They really hate Common Core, y\u2019all.)\n\nIt\u2019s a sneak preview of the 2016 session. Next year, look for those bills to come to a legislature near you.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://flagpole.com/news/news-features/2015/05/20/republicans-had-their-convention-in-athens-you-won-t-believe-what-happened-next", "type": "article", "image": "http://flagpole.com/img/2015/05/20/GOPConvention-BenghaziMatters.jpg", "site_name": "Flagpole Magazine | Athens, GA News, Music, Arts, Restaurants", "title": "Inside the Republican Convention in Athens"}, "google-site-verification": "Y4nsw6wzD0RdM2uh0YPtr3HCiLrC0k55SUBxTAG7lJs", "fb": {"app_id": 1387818094779966}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd119b\"", "article_summary": "A committee has drafted a resolution calling on the legislature to pass a religious liberty without any protections against discrimination.\nThe promised fight over religious liberty never materializes\u2014all the resolutions are approved by voice vote.\nHe came all the way from New Jersey to open the Georgia Republican Convention last Friday, and no one seems to care.\nThe rumor is that the convention\u2019s 2,000 delegates will have a big fight on the floor over religious liberty.\nAnd he did it without \u201cthe luxury of a Republican legislature,\u201d he says, before zinging the all-or-nothing tea party."}
