(William DeShazer/The Commercial Appeal)</p>\n\nBy Jane Roberts\n\nIn a county that now has eight school districts \u2014 with open enrollment agreements between most of them \u2014 the first day of school and the critical weeks that follow create a new shopping season of sorts here: Depending on how parents feel, they are either going to be sold on their school choices and settle in for a happy year, or have buyer\u2019s remorse and look around.\n\nAll the school districts know this. From a customer service standpoint (and public relations too), the next six weeks are the most significant touch point school boards have in the whole year to get things right and make allies with their customers.\n\nThe earliest telltale signs will be how efficient the buses run, how smoothly the cafeterias operate and, in a week, how clean the buildings are.\n\nThe merged district stumbled last year in each area, plus a few more, including an errant payroll system that messed up payday for hundreds of employees. Even though Shelby County Schools said only about 1 percent of employees were affected, the recurring images of the first few weeks were teachers waiting to get paid and families driving their children to school when the school bus, in some cases weeks later, was unreliable.\n\n\u201cThe first cardinal rule is just do a good job,\u201d said Tom DeLapp, who advises 420 school districts in California in crisis communication, public engagement and customer service. \u201cThat enables people to have confidence that their system knows what it is doing.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the buses run on time, the presumption is that other things work in the system,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the buses don\u2019t work, then it raises the question, \u2018What other things do not work?\u2019\u201d\n\nLast week, superintendents in the suburbs \u2014 not midlevel managers \u2014 were driving bus routes, looking for unsafe left-hand turns and glitches that make buses late while also monitoring the news on a possible Teamster strike that threatened to undo their planning.\n\nFor months, the districts have been looking at operations, trying to put their money where they have their largest interface with families and where they can get the most efficiency. One of the first decisions the suburban superintendents made was to decentralize lunch operations and put the school \u201clunch ladies\u201d back to work.\n\n\u201cHonestly, that was one of the easiest decisions we made,\u201d said Lakeland Supt. Ted Horrell. \u201cThere was almost no discussion. We wanted the food served to our students to be cooked in our kitchens.\u201d\n\nTo do it, they are giving cafeteria employees more hours, hoping to reduce the high absentee rates that plagued schools across the county last year when hours were cut to save money in the merger. And by making each cafeteria autonomous, leaders say they can also avoid the food-quality problems that cut participation in the school lunch program last year.\n\n\u201cJust like a business, if you aren\u2019t making a profit, you can\u2019t keep the staff in the cafeteria. Last year, we had positions cut in the middle of the year,\u201d said Germantown Supt. Jason Manuel.\n\n\u201cIn the merger, they changed the positions. We used to have a cafeteria manager and a lead cashier. Those jobs were reduced to lower hours, which meant less pay and fewer benefits. It made it challenging to find people willing to do the work,\u201d he said.\n\nAt one point last year, SCS was transporting substitute workers to suburban cafeterias to cover the holes. The other problem was food delivery.\n\n\u201cOh my gosh, it was terrible,\u201d said Manuel, who was principal of Houston Middle until he took the superintendent\u2019s job in December. \u201cMy cafeteria manager would get shipments she didn\u2019t order. That continued through the year. You could not send them back. You had to keep it in the freezers.\u201d\n\nBecause the menus were centralized, cafeteria managers had no authority to serve the items that students liked and that they thought could have increased lunch participation.\n\n\u201cWe were able to take the good and bad of last year and learn from that,\u201d said SCS board chairman Kevin Woods. \u201cAnd hopefully we have made some drastic improvements, and I think the public will notice.\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s not just operations. We also learned how to respond to mistakes and get out in front and address them head on. We learned a lot about being more prepared and how we communicated.\u201d\n\nSCS, which this year is serving free breakfast and lunch to all students, is taking a calculated risk that participation won\u2019t jump through the roof. It hasn\u2019t budgeted extra funds for food service, even though other states offering universal free lunch programs have seen double-digit increases in the number of takers.\n\n\u201cSome districts saw a lesser increase,\u201d said district spokesman Christian Ross. \u201cWe will monitor actual participation during the first six weeks of school and, if warranted, submit a resolution to our (school) board to revise our budget, including staffing adjustments.\u201d\n\nSCS had its own headaches with food last year. The intensity shows in a 10-page memo school board members received last week with contingency plans for most visible operations problems, including transportation and building cleanliness. Food service problems took up half the space.\n\nBy July 18, SCS had identified 125 cafeteria tech vacancies (pay is $11.78 hour) out of total of 953 and was offering them to people on the substitute list. But the more difficult problem to handle is the no-shows, whose absence at work gums up lunch operations.\n\nThis year, SCS will have a pool of substitute workers at the Central Nutrition Center on Jackson Avenue on Monday, \u201cready to take immediate assignments as we learn of previously unidentified vacancies,\u201d according to the memo.\n\nThe district has also rented vans and scheduled drivers to get workers from the CNC to the cafeterias with no-show workers. The names of cafeteria workers who did not show up for training the week of July 21 were flagged. If they do not report to work this week, their jobs will be posted.\n\nIn talks with teachers and principals last week, Woods was clear that all customers, teachers, parents and students, have never had the options that exist in Shelby County today. \u201cQuite honestly, it starts with the day they call in to express an interest in Shelby County Schools. How are they treated on the phone and when they walk through the school doors?\u201d\n\nLast summer, SCS Supt. Dorsey Hopson set up a customer call center at the Teaching and Learning Academy at 2485 Union to field the calls in the central office, capture data on the nature of them and to monitor how long it took to resolve the issues.\n\nInitial data show half the calls came from district employees.\n\n\u201cBy knowing what information needs to be out there, we\u2019ll be able to make improvements and have a better-educated workforce on many issues,\u201d Woods said.\n\n\u201cWe know that eyes are on Shelby County Schools as it relates to how well we treat our customers and how well we run our school system,\u201d Woods said. \u201cI think folks will be proud of the work we have done. We still have a long way to go. We welcome criticisms and suggestions. We are open.\u201d\n\n___________\n\nOn the road\n\nThirty thousand Shelby County Schools children ride school buses on 460 routes each day.\n\n\n\nMeal time\n\nSCS central kitchen will serve free breakfast and lunch to children in 228 schools.\n\n\n\nOn the job\n\nBy late July, SCS had filled 99.3\n\npercent of its teaching jobs.\n\n\n\nSmaller Operations\n\nThe number of schools in the new municipal districts ranges from one in Lakeland to 11 in Bartlett.\n\n\n\nBack in Control\n\nThis year the suburban districts return to cooking meals in their school cafeterias.\n\n\n\nUpdates online\n\nFollow the first day of school with us at commercialappeal.com.", "article_metadata": {"title": "School districts throughout Shelby County ready for start of new year", "og": {"url": "http://www.commercialappeal.com/news/schools/school-districts-throughout-shelby-county-ready-for-start-of-new-year-ep-532764197-324357231.html", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/ns_schools_0017_7186604_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "height": 427}, "type": "article", "description": "Shelby County\u00c2\u00a0Schools already knows where the trouble spots are for first day of school and it has spent weeks hammering out Plan A and Plan B solutions.", "title": "School districts throughout Shelby County ready for start of new year"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.jrn.com/images/ns_schools_0017_7186604_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "title": "School districts throughout Shelby County ready for start of new year", "description": "Shelby County\u00c2\u00a0Schools already knows where the trouble spots are for first day of school and it has spent weeks hammering out Plan A and Plan B solutions.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "https://twitter.com/memphisnews"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/logo-ca-icon-144.png", "__sync_contentCategory": "premium", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0524\"", "article_summary": "We are open.\u201d___________On the roadThirty thousand Shelby County Schools children ride school buses on 460 routes each day.\n\u201cQuite honestly, it starts with the day they call in to express an interest in Shelby County Schools.\n\u201cThe first cardinal rule is just do a good job,\u201d said Tom DeLapp, who advises 420 school districts in California in crisis communication, public engagement and customer service.\nAll the school districts know this.\nOne of the first decisions the suburban superintendents made was to decentralize lunch operations and put the school \u201clunch ladies\u201d back to work."}
