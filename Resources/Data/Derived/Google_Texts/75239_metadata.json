Bob Casey, D-Pa., made some questionable claims in an op-ed defending his vote to continue granting federal funds to Planned Parenthood.\n\n\u201cPlanned Parenthood facilities also provide many other basic health services, like cervical and breast cancer screening, as well as primary care and family planning,\u201d Casey wrote in The Scranton Times-Tribune. \u201cIt is those services that would be curtailed by cutting off federal funding to Planned Parenthood.\u201d\n\nCasey also argues that due to the Hyde Amendment, federal funds granted to Planned Parenthood aren\u2019t used for abortion.\n\nBut pro-lifers take issue with Casey\u2019s claim that such services would be \u201ccurtailed\u201d if Planned Parenthood no longer received taxpayer funding.\n\n\u201cThere are literally thousands of alternatives to Planned Parenthood that provide more comprehensive health services to women but haven\u2019t been tainted by the gruesome acts exposed by these videos,\u201d argued Roger Severino, the director of the DeVos Center at The Heritage Foundation.\n\n\u201cTaxpayer funds should be directed to them instead,\u201d Severino said.\n\nThe Daily Signal\u2019s Kelsey Harkness recently reported that there are \u201c13,540 clinics providing comprehensive health care for women, versus 665 Planned Parenthood locations.\u201d\n\nIn a video released Tuesday, Students for Life of America depicts alternatives to Planned Parenthood in Lancaster, Pa., a community represented by Casey that Planned Parenthood President and Chief Executive Cecile Richards called \u201cmedically underserved.\u201d\n\nStudents for Life found nine community health centers in contrast to one Planned Parenthood clinic in Lancaster.\n\nKristan Hawkins, president of Students for Life, told The Daily Signal that there are numerous alternatives to Planned Parenthood for low-income women seeking health care.\n\n\u201cCommunity Health Centers and other federally funded health clinics do everything that Planned Parenthood does except abortions,\u201d Hawkins said. \u201cThere are under 700 Planned Parenthood facilities nationally while there are over 8,000 federally funded Community Health Centers and 2,000 pregnancy help centers.\u201d\n\nThe ratio of health centers to Planned Parenthood clinics shows that Planned Parenthood\u2019s services are replaceable, Hawkins argued.\n\n\u201cThere will be no apocalypse if Planned Parenthood is defunded and their facilities start to close. In fact, while Planned Parenthood sounds the alarm that women won\u2019t have access to life-saving treatment, their cancer screenings and prevention programs are in a free fall. From 2009-2013, cancer screenings dropped over 50 percent as did prenatal services.\u201d\n\nHawkins said that Planned Parenthood\u2019s business model centers on abortion, not health services such as mammograms.\n\nShe also said that \u201cthere is not one Planned Parenthood that does mammograms,\u201d while some federally funded health centers are equipped to \u201cdo mammograms right on the premises.\u201d\n\n\u201cWomen have other options besides relying on an organization hell bent on doing whatever they have to do in order to make a profit.\u201d\n\nThe Daily Signal reached out to Casey\u2019s office to ask about his claims that health services would be \u201ccurtailed\u201d if Planned Parenthood were defunded and if the senator would support redirecting funds granted to Planned Parenthood to other women\u2019s health providers.
