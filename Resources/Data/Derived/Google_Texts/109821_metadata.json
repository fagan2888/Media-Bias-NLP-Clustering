Fristoe says if you don't, it could affect your tax refund next April.\n\n\n\nFristoe says if you receive a subsidy now and you make more money throughout the year than you originally put on your application, come tax season you could have to pay part of that subsidy back.\n\n\n\nAnd if you make less money then you expected, you could get some extra subsidy money come April.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou've got to project your income accurately, any changes that take place, in fact. They agree on the marketplace application that if any changes take place other then what they put down, you've got to contact the market place and let them know what those changes are so they can adjust those subsidy, says Fristoe.\n\n\n\nFristoe says any income counts toward your subsidy eligibility.
