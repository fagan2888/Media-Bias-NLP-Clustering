(Photo: AP )\n\nBarbra Streisand\u2019s new album of duets only includes male singers, but it wasn\u2019t a conscious effort to exclude females.\n\n\u201cEveryone we asked was ... busy,\u201d Streisand said. The performer almost scored one major diva: Beyonce.\n\n\u201cShe had her people try to do a track of one of the songs from my movie, \u2018A Star is Born,\u2019 and it just, we didn\u2019t have the time to finish it, to get it right,\u201d she said. \u201cWe had to release the album. Maybe someday we\u2019ll do a duet because she\u2019s so great.\u201d\n\n\u201cPartners,\u201d released Tuesday, features Billy Joel, Stevie Wonder, John Mayer, John Legend and Babyface, who produced the album.\n\nStreisand, who appeared at the Clinton Health Matters conference in La Quinta in 2013, discussed music, directing, women\u2019s right and politics.\n\nWould you do an album full of female duets next?\n\nSTREISAND: Possibly. I loved singing with Celine (Dion) and Donna Summer.\n\nWhat was the energy like in the studio for you and your guests?\n\nWe were all nervous. Everybody was saying to me, \u201cI\u2019m nervous singing with you!\u201d And I said, \u201cWhoops, I\u2019m nervous singing with you.\u201d ... love that kind of nervousness. You know something\u2019s being done for posterity. I guess that\u2019s why I like making movies, too, because it lasts.\n\nHow have you maintained your voice over the years?\n\nI don\u2019t drink. I don\u2019t like the taste of liquor. I like beer sometimes. I can do half a shot of vodka with tonic, but it\u2019s always like medicine to me, alcohol. I don\u2019t drink wine even. Maybe that has something to do with it. I smoked when I was 10 years old, you know on the streets, on the rooftops in Brooklyn because my stepfather smoked ... gave it up when I was 12.\n\nWas it weird singing along with Elvis Presley\u2019s vocals on \u201cLove Me Tender\u201d?\n\nNo, it just felt right. It felt natural. I met him. I talked to him. I wanted him for a movie.\n\nWhat movie?\n\nIt was \u201cA Star is Born\u201d many, many years ago. His career was slightly in decline, he was overweight and I thought he was perfect to play that part. \u2026It was fun to talk to him. He was talking about the process of how people don\u2019t understand that you need time and quiet before you perform. And he was talking about a girl in his life who doesn\u2019t understand that, and I said, \u201cOh you really have to explain that and tell her it\u2019s not personal; it\u2019s just that you need to be quiet before you go onstage.\u201d But it was lovely to share these stories with each other.\n\nAre you planning to do more movies?\n\nI like directing. I\u2019m planning to direct a move and also be in a couple of things maybe that I\u2019ve meant to do over the years.\n\nAre you happy to see more female directors on the scene?\n\nWell, the problem is there aren\u2019t more. I swear to God I read a survey a few months ago, like less than 6 percent of women are directing films today, and that was (the same as) in the time I did \u201cYentl.\u201d\n\nWhy do you think that is?\n\nI think women are still treated as second-class citizens. We still don\u2019t get equal pay. Thank God I am in the music industry, so it\u2019s a bit different, but I\u2019m fortunate in that way. The average woman doesn\u2019t get the same pay; she gets 77 cents on the dollar that a man gets. I\u2019m so involved in women\u2019s heart disease and trying to raise awareness and funds; Even in medical research, women are not treated equally. The research on women\u2019s hearts is done in the last 50 years on men. ... So since women are 51 percent of the population I think we should really have that represented in Congress as well.\n\nSpeaking of politics, have you spoken to Hillary Clinton whether she\u2019ll run for president?\n\nI would love her to run. I think we have advanced with Obama, and I think people are giving him a hard time, which is not fair because this Affordable Care Act is working and it\u2019s going to help a lot of people. But it\u2019s like Greek tragedy, you know, they always try to bring down the gods, bring down the kings, bring down the leaders.\n\nDo you feel like he\u2019s doing a good job?\n\nI do. And it\u2019s right to take your time going to war and so forth. He has to be thoughtful.\n\nStar power\n\nBarbra Streisand sings with a stellar list of partners on her 34th studio album, \u201cPartners,\u201d including the awesome and unexpected: Andrea Bocelli, Kenneth \u201cBabyface\u201d Edmonds (who co-produced the album), Blake Shelton and Elvis Presley. The new recordings of beloved standards and some of Streisand\u2019s best known love songs feature her collaborators\u2019 talents perfectly, and every track delivers.\n\nUnseen Barbra\n\nSlated for release in December, \u201cBarbra: Streisand\u2019s Early Years in Hollywood, 1968-1976\u201d will include more than 240 images, many of them never published before. The text will feature a conversation between photojournalists Steve Schapiro and Lawrence Schiller, both of whom were commissioned to work with Streisand after she arrived in Hollywood.\n\nBut the main Collector\u2019s Edition is limited \u2014 1,000 copies. And the price is worthy of seats at a Streisand concert: $750. Two \u201cArt Editions\u201d are even more limited, 100 copies each, and cost $1,800. One set of \u201cArt Edition\u201d books features a print signed by Schapiro, the other a print signed by Schiller.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://desert.sn/1sdnWko", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Barbra Streisand\u2019s new album of duets only includes male singers.", "og": {"site_name": "Desert Sun", "description": "Barbra Streisand\u2019s new album of duets only includes male singers.", "title": "Barbra Streisand talks new album, collaborations", "url": "http://www.desertsun.com/story/life/entertainment/music/2014/09/20/barbra-streisand-new-album/15982735/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/desertsun.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Barbra Streisand\u2019s new album of duets only includes male singers.", "title": "Barbra Streisand talks new album, collaborations", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/85b28d6c5e22bc21cf022e8aa6da2058219455a8/c=344-0-2108-1764&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/PalmSprings/2014/09/20/streisandsing3.jpg", "creator": "@mydesert", "site": "@mydesert", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600074187", "fb": {"app_id": 116853348383382}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": ""}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb6a1\"", "article_summary": "Streisand, who appeared at the Clinton Health Matters conference in La Quinta in 2013, discussed music, directing, women\u2019s right and politics.\n(Photo: AP )Barbra Streisand\u2019s new album of duets only includes male singers, but it wasn\u2019t a conscious effort to exclude females.\nI think women are still treated as second-class citizens.\nEverybody was saying to me, \u201cI\u2019m nervous singing with you!\u201d And I said, \u201cWhoops, I\u2019m nervous singing with you.\u201d ... love that kind of nervousness.\nBarbra Streisand performs at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn in 2012."}
