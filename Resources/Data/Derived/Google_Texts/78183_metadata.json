Jesse Ulibarri, one of the Democratic sponsors, said he had \u201cno clue\u201d what happened. \u201cThis is one of those where I walked away scratching my head,\u201d the Westminster lawmaker said.\n\nUnder the bill, Colorado would have held a presidential primary in March that ran parallel with the state\u2019s complicated caucus system. In doing so, it would have allowed unaffiliated voters to play a larger role in selecting the party\u2019s nominees for president and attracted more national political attention. Colorado is considered one of the seven true swing states for the 2016 election.\n\nIn addition to both major parties, the bill drew support from prominent Democrats and Republicans, including Senate President Bill Cadman, R-Colorado Springs. But when it came before the Senate Appropriations Committee, four Republicans voted to kill the bill with three Democrats supporting it.\n\nCommittee Chairman Kevin Grantham, R-Canon City, sponsored the bill but voted against it, saying \u201ceverybody who claimed to be in support of the bill were not in support of the bill.\u201d\n\nIn particular, he said GOP Chairman Steve House retracted his initial support.\n\n\u201cWe got an indication from the Republican chair this morning that he wasn\u2019t (in support),\u201d Grantham said. \u201cUntil they can all get all their ducks in the row, we are not going to do anything major like this at the 11th hour of session.\u201d\n\nBut a Republican Party spokesman said House did not revoke his support.\n\nJust before the bill\u2019s introduction, the chairman voiced support saying it would \u201cgive this critical swing state more attention during the primaries, and it will make it easier for voters to get involved in the nomination process.\u201d\n\nThe bill\u2019s price tag did create questions. The cost to the state was estimated at $1.7 million \u2014 with the cost at the county level ranging between $4 million and $5 million, according to a legislative analysis.\n\nThe committee amended the bill to cover the $1.7 million cost from the general fund, or the discretionary pot of taxpayer dollars, rather than force the Secretary of State to raise fees on businesses and charities to pay for it.\n\nBut a more powerful undercurrent came in opposition from conservatives in the party, who believed a primary election would lead to more mainstream Republican candidates with the involvement of unaffiliated voters.\n\nAlso, a group called Save the Caucus, led by John Wren, pushed lawmakers to oppose the bill because it hurt the current process.\n\nColorado Democratic Party Chairman Rick Palacio responded to the news with frustration. \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing, but not surprising, that Republicans would choose to limit the role of Colorado voters instead of expanding the electorate and the voice of Colorado in choosing future Presidents,\u201d he said in a statement.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "2016 election,Bill Cadman,Colorado Republican Party,Kevin Grantham,presidential caucus,presidential primary,Senate Appropriations Committee,Steve House", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "The Spot", "description": "An apparent disagreement among Republicans led a Senate panel Monday to reject the party\u00e2\ufffd\ufffds own push to create a presidential primary in 2016.", "title": "Senate GOP kills party's own push for 2016 presidential primary", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/thespot/2015/05/04/senate-republicans-kill-partys-own-push-for-2016-presidential-primary/119831/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/thespot/files/2014/04/Steve-House-001.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "An apparent disagreement among Republicans led a Senate panel Monday to reject the party\u00e2\ufffd\ufffds own push to create a presidential primary in 2016.", "creator": "@ByJohnFrank", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/thespot/2015/05/04/senate-republicans-kill-partys-own-push-for-2016-presidential-primary/119831/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/thespot/files/2014/04/Steve-House-001.jpg", "title": "Senate Republicans kill party\u2019s own push for 2016 presidential primary", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "An apparent disagreement among Republicans led a Senate panel Monday to reject the party\u2019s own push to create a presidential primary in 2016."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf9d0\"", "article_summary": "An apparent disagreement among Republicans led a Senate panel Monday to reject the party\u2019s own push to create a presidential primary in 2016.\nUnder the bill, Colorado would have held a presidential primary in March that ran parallel with the state\u2019s complicated caucus system.\nIn addition to both major parties, the bill drew support from prominent Democrats and Republicans, including Senate President Bill Cadman, R-Colorado Springs.\nBut when it came before the Senate Appropriations Committee, four Republicans voted to kill the bill with three Democrats supporting it.\nColorado is considered one of the seven true swing states for the 2016 election."}
