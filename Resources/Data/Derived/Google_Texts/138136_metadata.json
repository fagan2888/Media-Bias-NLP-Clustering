Amid all the inflammatory rhetoric that has characterized this election, former Sen. and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has consistently offered rational, productive, achievable answers to the serious problems our nation faces. It is time to set out on a path on which we can address difficult challenges rather than vent anger and cast blame.\n\nIn choosing a leader, I look through the lens of Jewish values and teachings as well as the strengthening of the relationship between two great democracies, the U.S. and Israel. Jewish tradition is replete with guidance directing us to aid the poor, to care for the sick, and to provide charity funds that establish people on firmer footing. On all of these accounts, Clinton\u2019s policies and record are, in my opinion, the most consonant with those values and priorities. Jewish tradition and history speak to the obligation to welcome and care for the vulnerable \u2014 the widow, the orphan and the stranger. Deuteronomy 10:19 enjoins us to \u201clove the stranger for you were strangers in the land of Egypt.\u201d\n\nAs Jews, the discussion of immigration resonates deeply. We know what the blessing of our ancestors\u2019 immigration to America has meant to our families; we also know the perils that our relatives faced fleeing persecution and death in the Shoah. Recognizing that immigrants are an engine for vitality that pulls our country forward, we know that we cannot cross a bridge to safety only to pull it up behind us, nor should we build walls around our country to keep people out. Clinton understands that immigration \u201cis at heart a family issue.\u201d\n\nUnderlying the vitriol in the immigration debate this election season is the profound income inequality that our country faces. Americans haven\u2019t seen any increase in their adjusted-for-inflation wages in the past 15 years. The fear that more low-wage immigrant workers in the country will increase the real suffering of America\u2019s working poor must be addressed through sound policy, not through fanning the flames of anger. Here again, Clinton has offered real solutions to address these profound challenges.\n\nPeople need wages that allow them to live with dignity and access to education without crushing debt. At each rung of the income ladder, Clinton proposes policies to bring improvement: a $12 minimum wage, laws to prevent worker misclassification and wage theft, extending a tax credit of up to $2,500 per student to help with college costs and a New College Compact to make higher education available to many for whom it currently is not.\n\nHealth care continues to be a daunting challenge for most Americans. Hillary Clinton has spent decades, probably longer than any politician currently on the political scene, working on this key issue. The Affordable Care Act has allowed more Americans to become insured than ever before, and what we badly need \u2014 and deserve \u2014 is someone in office committed to improving the ACA, not starting from scratch with untenable ideas.\n\nAmerican women across today\u2019s generations have discussed the significance of the prospect of a first woman president. While some of us, including me, were shaped by the models of pioneering women such as Clinton, the success of the women\u2019s movement leads younger women to judge leaders by their commitments and achievements, not by their genders. Whatever the meaning of Hillary Clinton\u2019s gender to a particular Jewish woman, her exceptional commitment to women has been consistent with the values and goals that Jewish women have sought as part of the larger society. She continues to champion women\u2019s reproductive rights and right to equal pay and workplace treatment. As the Passover season approaches, we especially can appreciate that as secretary of state, she worked to protect women subject to sexual and other forms of slavery and abuse.\n\nAs both secretary of state and as senator, Clinton also demonstrated her commitment to Israel. While she was at the State Department, military support to Israel increased by 20 percent and she led the way on developing a tough Iran sanctions regime. During her tenure, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called U.S.-Israel security cooperation \u201cunprecedented.\u201d Secretary Clinton fought the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement and defended Israel\u2019s legitimacy around the world. Her record on Israel is unparalleled.\n\nJudaism sets high expectations and high goals for us. We are to see all people as created \u201cb\u2019tzelem Elohim,\u201d all of us of both equal and infinite value. We are to care for our own community and to work for the betterment of the world. It is time to stop wringing our hands about the current political discourse and start rolling up our sleeves. In Hillary Clinton we have an experienced leader with a record of action and resilience who can solve problems and bring us closer to the ideals that inspire us.\n\nRabbi Julie Schonfeld is executive vice-president of the Rabbinical Assembly, the association of all the Conservative/Masorti movement rabbis in the world.
