WASHINGTON D.C. (January 24, 2016) - Before this weekend's massive snowstorm hit the nation's capital, Sen. Dan Coats (R-IN) appeared on this week's edition of IN Focus to discuss the race for President and his vote to reform the nation's Syrian refugee program, a measure that was blocked last week in the Senate.

"The intelligence that I get in the intelligence committee said we do not have the screening processes in place to ensure that these immigrants are not infiltrated with ISIS," said Coats, who split with fellow Indiana senator Joe Donnelly on last week's vote.

Coats also discussed this year's unusual race for President - and with Donald Trump and Ted Cruz leading the way for the Republican nomination, we asked Coats which candidates he prefers.

"Like everybody else here, I'm watching this as something I've never seen before in my lifetime, in terms of how this nomination process is playing out" said Coats. "In the end, I want to see someone nominated who can in November... I can't count the days fast enough until we get a new leader in place that sees the reality of what's happening in this world... we are not getting the leadership that we need."
