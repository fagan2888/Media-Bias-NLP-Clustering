Those wise men brought gifts to the Christ child. With that in mind on this Christmas Eve local Muslims brought gifts as a peace gesture to the Christian ministry.\n\nMahmood Karim, who helped organize the collection, explained the peace gesture saying, \"We just want to make Wichita feel comfortable that we are the citizens of Wichita, in particular, and of the United States, in general.\"\n\nKarim says Muslims have suffered a negative backlash after the terror attacks in Paris and San Bernardino with some saying, \"Muslims are bad. They profile them as being terrorists. That's totally wrong.\"\n\nHe says it is time Muslims break their silence and speak up about the stereotyping. \"We're all brothers. We're all creations of same God. And we are here to help them celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ.\"\n\nSo several members of the Wichita Muslim community including students from WSU and Wichita schools brought clothes, toys and food to the Union Rescue.\n\nSyeda Nabeela is a WSU junior who helped with the gift collections saying, \"This is a time for everyone to just come together.. eat and just live.. just enjoy life. It's not about Christianity. It's not about Buddism. It's not about Islam. We are all taught peace.\"\n\nUnion Rescue Mission's Executive Director Denny Bender says he welcomes the gifts saying they will help the homeless in Wichita.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "Wichita Muslims bring gifts to Union Rescue Mission saying it's time to stop lumping Muslims in with terrorists.", "language": "english", "author": "Chris Frank", "og": {"description": "Wichita Muslims bring gifts to Union Rescue Mission saying it's time to stop lumping Muslims in with terrorists.", "title": "Wichita Muslims bring Christmas gifts to Union Rescue Mission", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Wichita-Muslims-bring-Christmas-gifts-to-Union-Rescue-Mission-363502111.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/677/1A9/6771A9BE62504A92A32A66939B1EC145", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/057/90F/05790F69FE7449CABAC9C001F93273C9.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kake.com", "description": "Wichita Muslims bring gifts to Union Rescue Mission saying it's time to stop lumping Muslims in with terrorists.", "title": "Wichita Muslims bring Christmas gifts to Union Rescue Mission", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Wichita-Muslims-bring-Christmas-gifts-to-Union-Rescue-Mission-363502111.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/muslim+donation.jpg", "creator": "@KAKEnews", "site": "@KAKEnews", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Wichita Muslims bring Christmas gifts to Union Rescue Mission", "google-site-verification": "H0mev8O__gMqb34WcvOyZgBXFMRQZvDAQ0YTSGJ9hGQ", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Wichita Muslims bring Christmas gifts"}, "article_summary": "The sign at the entrance of the Wichita Union Rescue Mission says 'Wise men came to a shelter 2000 years ago.'\nWith that in mind on this Christmas Eve local Muslims brought gifts as a peace gesture to the Christian ministry.\nUnion Rescue Mission's Executive Director Denny Bender says he welcomes the gifts saying they will help the homeless in Wichita.\nKarim says Muslims have suffered a negative backlash after the terror attacks in Paris and San Bernardino with some saying, \"Muslims are bad.\nSo several members of the Wichita Muslim community including students from WSU and Wichita schools brought clothes, toys and food to the Union Rescue."}
