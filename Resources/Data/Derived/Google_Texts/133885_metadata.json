Could we see some evidence of sobriety this week, please?\n\nI\u2019m not holding my breath. The reaction to the People\u2019s Bank of China announcement last week that it was effectively devaluing the yuan by roughly 2 percent was a mix of misunderstanding and hypocrisy. The former does damage and the latter makes fools of people who should know better -- in combination they\u2019re just short of poisonous.\n\nRelated: Here\u2019s the Big Loser from China\u2019s Currency Devaluation\n\nMa Jun, chief economist at the PBoC issued a statement Sunday intended to steady the markets as they open Monday morning. First, he said China has \u201cno need or intention to participate in a currency war.\u201d I take this to be true, but with qualifications.\n\nThen Ma warned investors to expect more \u201ctwo-way volatility\u201d in the yuan-dollar exchange rate. True without qualification, but you tell me how this assertion will go over.\n\nWhy did the markets react with so much volatility, and why was it unnecessary? The answer to the first has two parts.\n\nOne, the PBoC\u2019s announcement was taken as a signal that China\u2019s economy is slowing more dramatically than previous measures had indicated. The perception in the markets, The New York Times reported, was that China\u2019s leaders are panicking.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to look very hard to conclude that it was investors doing the panicking, not the technocrats in Beijing. That leads to the second point.\n\nRelated: How a Soaring Dollar Forced China to Devalue Its Currency\n\nAs a source in Asia put it in a note Sunday, \u201cThis has nothing to do with reality. Last May, the I.M.F. reported that the RMB [the renminbi, the yuan] was fairly valued. In the interval it has increased by about 5 percent on an REER basis.\u201d REER, real effective exchange rate, uses a trade-weighted average to calculate currency values.\n\nAnother problem arises from ungrounded, not to say stupid expectations. Western advocates of market reforms in China were long ago lulled into a contradictory faith in the Communist Party\u2019s ability to manage growth, currency rates, debt levels, and other macroeconomic factors. The unsayable truth, considered in this space years ago, is that American free-marketers doing business in China have been thoroughly invested in the Communist leadership\u2019s command over the economy since Deng Xiaoping\u2019s day.\n\nSurprise! Beijing no longer has anything liked the control over the economy it did in the pre-Deng and Deng years. The yuan\u2019s fall attests to this, indeed. And the change is by design, of course.\n\nSurprise! China\u2019s transition to a market-oriented model may not always work to the advantage of those who profess to love markets. Here a nasty question arises: Do free-market advocates favor reform in China when it\u2019s good for their bottom lines but not when it isn\u2019t? Hmmm.\n\nAs to why the severe market reaction was unnecessary, again, there are two parts to the answer.\n\nRelated: China\u2019s Currency Shock: The Perfect Excuse for the Fed to Rethink Rate Hikes\n\nOne, last week\u2019s depreciation didn\u2019t tell anyone anything new about the slowdown in China. We already knew growth was decelerating. GDP is now ticking over at 7 percent per annum, and if this is grounds for panic, someone who panicked needs to explain.\n\nTwo, the currency move signaled that China was simply taking another step to mitigate the consequences of slower growth. Last time I looked, intervening to encourage growth\u2014in this case by supporting export industries with a weaker currency\u2014was a good thing, not an occasion for markets to gyrate and politicians to erupt in protest.\n\nAnd so to the hypocrisy heaped atop the misunderstandings.\n\n\u201cFor years China has rigged the rules and played games with its currency,\u201d Chuck Schumer, the senior Democratic senator from New York, said last week. \u201cRather than changing their ways, the Chinese government seems to be doubling down.\u201d\n\nJiminy Cricket. This guy is fighting the last war\u2014and it has been over for years. Not to be rude, but Schumer and other longtime currency agitators on Capitol Hill have no clue what they\u2019re talking about.\n\nEvery single industrialized nation without exception, and many in the developing world, has resorted to currency devaluation as a Band-Aid fix at one time or another. Holier-than-thou is a cardboard position at this point. Freshmen in economics won\u2019t take it seriously.\n\nRelated: Senior U.S. Lawmakers Condemn China Currency Devaluation\n\nChina has gradually exposed the yuan to market pressures for a decade. What it did last week was adjust the median point that fixes a band within which the currency can trade against the dollar in its \u201cmanaged floating exchange rate regime.\u201d The yuan subsequently fell a further 1.4 percent\u2014the market\u2019s doing, not the PBoC\u2019s, and evidence enough that the currency was overvalued.\n\nTwo points here. One, there\u2019s no \u201cdoubling down\u201d in this. In net terms the PBoC took a further step toward liberalization, given it will now refrain from intervening unless it judges market volatility too extreme. The International Monetary Fund, which told Beijing Friday it wants the yuan to float freely within three years, applauded the Chinese central bank on this basis.\n\nTwo, the PBoC\u2019s move was craftily timed, for sure: It knew the market would do the rest of the work after its initial announcement. But then the central bank did intervene\u2014this time to support the yuan against further depreciation.\n\n\u201cThe PBoC has effectively defanged potential critics by offering just what has been asked of it\u2014more currency flexibility,\u201d said Eswar Prasad, a Cornell professor and formerly head of the International Monetary Fund\u2019s China bureau.\n\nI think we can forget about any currency war, Senator. Simply not at issue.\n\nRelated: China Central Bank Says No Basis for Further Yuan Depreciation\n\nSchumer now opposes allowing the yuan into a basket of international reserve currencies \u201cunless and until China stops artificially devaluing.\u201d Wrong again. Requiring China to conform to global currency-management standards is exactly what we want to do now.\n\nLetting the yuan drop to restore exporters\u2019 competitiveness is hardly the answer to China\u2019s economic challenges \u2014numerous and fundamental as they are. It\u2019s a grace note next to the truly big moves China has to make.\n\nWe should understand it as such, drop the sanctimony, and avoid more senseless panic this week.\n\nMaybe we will.
