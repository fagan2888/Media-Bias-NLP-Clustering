Holy sh*t!\u201d\n\nposted at 12:47 pm on September 10, 2013 by Katie Pavlich\n\nHere\u2019s your feel good story of the day. The guy in this video, Jason Mortensen, wakes up from surgery to find his wife, who he doesn\u2019t remember being his wife thanks to anesthesia. His response to her being by his side is precious. From the video description:\n\nIn response to all of the questions: I had a hernia repair to fix residual tears from a previous surgery.\n\nI wish I could remember this but I was definitely out of it.\n\nThis was my fifth surgery within our six years of marriage and she\u2019s been by my side through all of it. In a previous surgery I suffered a severe complication and we didn\u2019t know if I\u2019d ever function the same again. She is the love of my life.\n\n\n\nUPDATE: Ed informs me this could be fake, but you know what? It\u2019s still cute.\n\nRecently in the Green Room:", "article_metadata": {"description": "\u201cYou\u2019re my wife?
