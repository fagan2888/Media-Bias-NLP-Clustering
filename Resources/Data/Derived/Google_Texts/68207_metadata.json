Before then, Aetna had struck a more upbeat tone compared to some rival insurers.\n\n\u201cThe secretary called me that evening at home to say, \u2018What happened?\u2019\u201d Bertolini said in an interview.\n\n\u201cWell, I told her you need to read the whole (earnings transcript), which she did and she calmed down. We like the program and we think it\u2019s an appropriate effort. But we do need to make changes.\u201d\n\nGovernment officials, he said, need to be more flexible on rates and benefit design to attract younger and healthier consumers. Those enrollees are crucial to offset the higher medical costs of insuring older, chronically ill patients.\n\n\u201cYoung people pay some amount of premium, pick a number, and have a $5,000 deductible and go to the doctor once a year and pay all in cash,\u201d Bertolini said. \u201cFor people under 35, their definition of health is looking good in their underwear. How does that program support their view of what\u2019s good health?\u201d\n\nBertolini suggested introducing lower-deductible plans for young consumers, focused on staying healthy.\n\nSome state exchanges, including California, have acknowledged those concerns and included some initial doctor visits that aren\u2019t subject to the annual deductible.\n\nBut California and other states also set standard deductibles, copays and other benefits, forcing insurers to compete more directly on price and making it simpler for consumers to compare plans. That runs counter to the industry\u2019s call for more variety.\n\nA spokesman for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services declined to comment on Burwell\u2019s conversation with Bertolini.\n\nIndustry criticism of public exchanges began to escalate in November when Stephen Hemsley, CEO of UnitedHealth Group Inc., said the company might stop selling Obamacare coverage after suffering substantial financial losses. Other insurers, including big Blue Cross Blue Shield plans, expressed concern about higher-than-expected medical costs among the exchange population.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t really subsidize a marketplace that doesn\u2019t appear at the moment to be sustaining itself,\u201d Hemsley said in November.\n\nEarlier this month, Aetna said it lost up to $140 million, or a negative margin of 3 percent to 4 percent, on individual coverage last year. The company said it expects to break even this year in the 15 states where it\u2019s selling public exchange policies.\n\nIn California, Bertolini said he remains open to joining the California insurance exchange if the two sides can agree on appropriate rates.\n\n\u201cWe talk to (Covered California) every year and when they are willing to accept our rates we are more than happy to participate,\u201d Bertolini said. \u201cWe think people should have a choice.\u201d\n\nAetna had a chance to join Covered California when it launched in the fall of 2013, but the company opted to exit the state\u2019s individual insurance market instead.\n\nInsurers will submit proposed rates for 2017 to Covered California in May and the exchange picks its participating health plans by summer.\n\nSeparately, Aetna has clashed repeatedly with the state Department of Managed Health Care over rate increases for small businesses. The agency has deemed four rate hikes by Aetna unreasonable since 2013, but the company went ahead with each one anyway. California officials review premiums but lack authority to stop health insurance rate increases.\n\nShelley Rouillard, the agency\u2019s director, accused Aetna of \u201cprice gouging\u201d when it raised rates by 21 percent, on average, for some small businesses last year. \u201cI can assure you rates are something that we will be looking at and considering as part of our review,\u201d Rouillard said at a state hearing on the Aetna-Humana deal last month.\n\nAn agency spokeswoman said there was no timetable for a decision on the acquisition.\n\nConsumer groups oppose the Aetna deal and a similar merger between Anthem Inc. and Cigna Corp., saying they will result in fewer choices and higher costs.\n\nBertolini said those fears about consolidation aren\u2019t justified and he said rate increases are necessary at times to cover rising medical costs.\n\n\u201cWhile California would like us to give away everything for free we can\u2019t do that. We have to have a financially sustainable product,\u201d Bertolini said.\n\nAsked if he would be willing to make concessions on premiums to win state approval for the Humana deal, Bertolini said: \u201cWe\u2019ll deal with that as we go through that process. We\u2019re in the early stages.\u201d\n\ncterhune@kff.org", "article_metadata": {"description": "But Mark Bertolini wants the marketplaces to better serve young people, who define healthy as \"looking good in their underwear.\u201d", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "California Healthline", "description": "But Mark Bertolini wants the marketplaces to better serve young people, who define healthy as \u201clooking good in their underwear.\u201d", "title": "Aetna CEO Backs Obamacare Exchanges, Talks Of Joining Covered California", "url": "http://californiahealthline.org/news/aetna-ceo-backs-obamacare-exchanges-talks-of-joining-covered-california/", "image": {"width": 770, "identifier": "https://californiahealthline.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/bertolini-770.jpg", "height": 513}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://californiahealthline.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/bertolini-770.jpg?w=640"}, "site": "@CalHealthline", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@CalHealthline"}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://californiahealthline.org/feed/;icon-uri=https://s2.wp.com/i/favicon.ico", "application-name": "California Healthline", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WordPresscom", "published_time": "2016-02-29T10:00:35+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-29T13:28:50+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "In California, Bertolini said he remains open to joining the California insurance exchange if the two sides can agree on appropriate rates.\nCalifornia officials review premiums but lack authority to stop health insurance rate increases.\nIn a wide-ranging interview, Chief Executive Mark Bertolini also left the door open to joining the California exchange if the two sides can agree on premiums.\nInsurers will submit proposed rates for 2017 to Covered California in May and the exchange picks its participating health plans by summer.\nSome state exchanges, including California, have acknowledged those concerns and included some initial doctor visits that aren\u2019t subject to the annual deductible."}
