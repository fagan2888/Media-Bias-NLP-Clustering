Trouble is, by thumbing his nose at Obama, the good doctor is also thumbing his nose at many of Alabama's neediest men, women and children.

A University of Alabama at Birmingham study last year said that the expansion in Alabama will provide Medicaid coverage to an additional 300,000 people and generate $20 billion in economic activity which will add $1.7 billion in tax revenue.

Bentley, in an interview with al.com's Kim Chandler last week, is unapologetic saying he believes he is acting in the best interest of Alabama and the rest of the country.

Chandler's interview with Bentley sparked this exchange between a couple of readers on the al.com comment board:

"Years from now folks will look back on this just as we are looking back now on George Wallace's stand in the school house door and they will wonder "what kind of people in Alabama could have supported a man like this ?" I have no party affiliation. But this man is an embarrassment to all of us. See elsewhere on Al.com about Alabama's slow job growth. Put 2 and 2 together."

"I thought about that same comparison this morning; that I hope the someday might arrive that Governor Bentley has the same redemption in regards to his intentionally keeping health care out of the needy in his state, the same way that Governor Wallace claimed to have a personal redemption later in his life about his earlier racist behavior."

And here is my colleague Joey Kennedy's column on Bentley's stand: Gov. Bentley's opposition to the Affordable Care Act isn't going to stop it
