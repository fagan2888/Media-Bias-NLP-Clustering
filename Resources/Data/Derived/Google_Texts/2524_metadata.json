Pete Sessions of Dallas, the chairman of the House Rules Committee, recently set a new standard when he declared the cost of Obamacare \u201cunconscionable.\u201d If you do simple multiplication, he insisted, you find that the coverage expansion is costing $5 million per recipient. But his calculation was a bit off \u2014 namely, by a factor of more than a thousand. The actual cost per newly insured American is about $4,000.\n\nNow, everyone makes mistakes, but this wasn\u2019t a forgivable error. Whatever your overall view of the Affordable Care Act, one indisputable fact is that it\u2019s costing taxpayers much less than expected \u2014 about 20 percent less, according to the Congressional Budget Office. A senior member of Congress should know that, and he certainly has no business making speeches about an issue if he won\u2019t bother to read budget office reports.\n\nBut that is, of course, how it\u2019s been all along with Obamacare. Before the law went into effect, opponents predicted disaster on all levels. What has happened instead is that the law is working pretty well. So how have the prophets of disaster responded? By pretending that the bad things they said would happen have, in fact, happened.\n\nCosts aren\u2019t the only area where enemies of reform prefer to talk about imaginary disasters rather than real success stories. Remember, Obamacare was also supposed to be a huge job-killer. In 2011, the House even passed a bill called the Repealing the Job-Killing Health Care Law Act. Health reform, opponents declared, would cripple the economy and, in particular, cause businesses to force their employees into part-time work.\n\nWell, Obamacare went into effect fully at the beginning of 2014, and private-sector job growth actually accelerated, to a pace we haven\u2019t seen since the Clinton years. Meanwhile, involuntary part-time employment \u2014 the number of workers who want full-time work but can\u2019t get it \u2014 has dropped sharply. But the usual suspects talk as if their dire predictions came true. Obamacare, Jeb Bush declared a few weeks ago, is \u201cthe greatest job suppressor in the so-called recovery.\u201d\n\nFinally, there\u2019s the never-ending hunt for snarks and boojums \u2014 for ordinary, hard-working Americans who have suffered hardship thanks to health reform. As we\u2019ve just seen, Obamacare opponents by and large don\u2019t do math (and they\u2019re sorry when they try). But all they really need are a few sob stories, tales of sympathetic individuals who have been impoverished by some aspect of the law.\n\nRemarkably, however, they haven\u2019t been able to find those stories. Early last year, Americans for Prosperity, a Koch brothers-backed group, ran a series of ads featuring alleged Obamacare victims \u2014 but not one of those tales of woe stood up to scrutiny. More recently, Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington state took to Facebook to ask for Obamacare horror stories. What she got instead was a torrent of testimonials from people whose lives have been improved, and in some cases saved, by health reform.\n\nIn reality, the only people hurt by health reform are Americans with very high incomes, who have seen their taxes go up, and a relatively small number of people who have seen their premiums rise because they\u2019re young and healthy (so insurers previously saw them as good risks) and affluent (so they don\u2019t qualify for subsidies). Neither group supplies suitable victims for attack ads.\n\nIn short, when it comes to the facts, the attack on health reform has come up empty-handed. But the public doesn\u2019t know that. The good news about costs hasn\u2019t made it through at all: According to a recent poll by Vox.com, only 5 percent of Americans know that Obamacare is costing less than predicted, while 42 percent think the government is spending more than expected.\n\nAnd the favorable experiences of the roughly 16 million Americans who have gained insurance so far have had little effect on public perceptions. Partly that\u2019s because the Affordable Care Act, by design, has had almost no effect on those who already had good health insurance: Before the act, a large majority of Americans were already covered by their employers, by Medicare or by Medicaid, and they have seen no change in their status.\n\nAt a deeper level, however, what we\u2019re looking at here is the impact of post-truth politics. We live in an era in which politicians and the supposed experts who serve them never feel obliged to acknowledge uncomfortable facts, an era in which no argument is ever dropped, no matter how overwhelming the evidence that it\u2019s wrong.\n\nAnd the result is that imaginary disasters can overshadow real successes. Obamacare isn\u2019t perfect, but it has dramatically improved the lives of millions. Someone should tell the voters.\n\nContact New York Times columnist Paul Krugman through nytimes.com.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The enemies of health care reform continue to declare disaster when the law is working pretty well, the columnist says.", "og": {"description": "The enemies of health care reform continue to declare disaster when the law is working pretty well, the columnist says.", "title": "Paul Krugman: Still waiting on those Obamacare horrors", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/latest-columns/20150402-paul-krugman-still-waiting-on-those-obamacare-horrors.ece", "image": {"width": 1280, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/latest-columns/20150402-court_obamacare_42597643.jpg.ece/BINARY/original/COURT_OBAMACARE_42597643.JPG", "height": 853}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2015-04-02T20:59:36Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2015-04-02T20:59:36Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Paul Krugman: Still waiting on those Obamacare horrors\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/latest-columns/20150402-paul-krugman-still-waiting-on-those-obamacare-horrors.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/latest-columns/20150402-court_obamacare_42597643.jpg.ece/BINARY/original/COURT_OBAMACARE_42597643.JPG\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"2242858\", \"pub_date\": \"2015-04-02T20:59:36Z\", \"section\": \"Latest Columns\", \"author\": \"PAUL KRUGMAN\", \"tags\": [\"dallas\", \"dallas fort worth\", \"dallas news\", \"dallas fort worth news\", \"dfw news\", \"dallas local news\", \"dallas fort worth local news\", \"dallas newspaper\", \"dallas morning news\", \"dallas morning news newspaper\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 1043783589, "page_id": 20946638799, "app_id": 258290334265148}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"image": "http://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/latest-columns/20150402-court_obamacare_42597643.jpg.ece/ALTERNATES/w660/COURT_OBAMACARE_42597643.JPG", "publishtime": "2015-04-02T20:59:36Z"}}, "news_keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7c2e\"", "article_summary": "As we\u2019ve just seen, Obamacare opponents by and large don\u2019t do math (and they\u2019re sorry when they try).\nHealth reform, opponents declared, would cripple the economy and, in particular, cause businesses to force their employees into part-time work.\nIn short, when it comes to the facts, the attack on health reform has come up empty-handed.\nWhat she got instead was a torrent of testimonials from people whose lives have been improved, and in some cases saved, by health reform.\nIn 2011, the House even passed a bill called the Repealing the Job-Killing Health Care Law Act."}
