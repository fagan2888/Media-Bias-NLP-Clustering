Born on May 26, 1951 in Los Angeles, today would have been Ride\u2019s 64th birthday. The woman physicist and astronaut made history by becoming the first American woman in space.\n\nIn 1977, Ride finished Ph.D. in Physics from Stanford University, applied to NASA and was one of the six women picked to be candidates for astronaut. She was 32 when she explored space on board space shuttle Challenger on June 18, 1983. Such was followed by another space mission on Challenger again in 1984.\n\nGoogle salutes Sally Ride with a new doodle to celebrate her 64th birthday, and worked with animator Nate Swinehart, doodle artist Olivia Huynh and Ride\u2019s partner and CEO of Sally Ride Science, Tam O\u2019Shaughnessy. Ride captured everyone\u2019s imagination as a symbol of women\u2019s ability to break barriers. However, her historic flight was not the only aspect of her multifaceted life.\n\nThe science writer Ride grew up with a chemistry set and telescope to play, and played football with neighbors. She thought of playing professional tennis, but put it aside to study science. In 1977, she saw an article that NASA was in search for astronauts, and allowed women to apply for the first time. She then sent her application.\n\nAccording to O\u2019Shaughnessy, Ride realized while in space, the importance of taking care of Mother Earth, and became an environmentalist. From the Challenger window, her planet looked wrapped in the thin air blanket. Years later, Ride wrote with O\u2019Shaughnessy, books for young adults about the changing climate of Earth.\n\nRide then became a California Space Institute director and San Diego\u2019s University of California physics professor. She learned girls were put off from pursuing math and science careers, and inspired them, the minority students and the young people in general, to be interested in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math.\n\nO\u2019Shaughnessy shared that Ride met boys and girls who wanted to be astronauts to explore space, oceanographers for their love of the ocean, zoologists as they love animals or engineers because they love to design things. Ride wanted to see the same stars in the eyes of those young people 10 years after, and knew they were on their way.\n\nWith O\u2019Shaughnessy and three other friends, Ride founded Sally Ride Science in 2001, which built study guides and programs so that science becomes fun and interesting to young people. They have trained teachers on how to spark and retain interest in STEM, reaching millions of students with their programs, books and publications.\n\nRide still worked with NASA through public-outreach programs for the Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory mission, which objectives were to determine the Moon\u2019s lunar interior structure and understand more its thermal evolution, and the knowledge gained can be extended to other planets. Ride likewise joined in the investigations into the Challenger and Columbia disasters in 1986 and 2003.\n\nRide won numerous awards throughout her life, such as, the NASA Space Flight Medal and the Theodore Roosevelt Award and was inducted into the National Women\u2019s Hall of Fame. She died on July 23, 2012 from pancreatic cancer.\n\nIn 2013, Ride was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, as the first American woman in space. According to President Obama, Ride \u201cdid not just break the stratospheric glass ceiling, but blasted through it.\u201d\n\nIt has been three years after her death, and as Google salutes Sally Ride with a new doodle, the first American woman in space would be honored by the GooGle Doodle which depicts her sense of adventure and fun with being whimsy, said O\u2019Shaughnessy. She added that who knows, the Doodle will motivate a kid somewhere to become an adventurer and a scientist, like Sally Ride.\n\nBy Judith Aparri\n\nSources:\n\nTime: New Google Doodle Honors First American Woman in Space, Sally Ride\n\nGoogle Doodles: Sally Ride\u2019s 64th Birthday\n\nNASA Science Mission: GRAIL\n\nPhoto courtesy of NASA HQ PHOTO\u2019s Flickr Page \u2013 Creative Commons License\n\nShare this: Print\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nPocket\n\nReddit\n\nEmail\n\nTwitter\n\nGoogle\n\nFacebook\n\nTumblr\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Guardian Liberty Voice", "description": "Google salutes Sally Ride on Tuesday, with a new animated Google Doodle.
