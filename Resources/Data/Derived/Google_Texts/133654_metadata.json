If homework time seems excessive or if children clearly don't understand their homework and need total supervision to complete it, parents should share these concerns with their child's teacher.\n\n\"Although most parents are not formally trained as educators, the homework time spent together can be used to teach a variety of learning strategies,\" said Resnick. \"For instance, teach prioritization of assignments or how to break a larger assignment into more manageable pieces.\"\n\nWhen homework gets tough, it's important for parents to help children remain confident and understand that learning is a process. \"Acknowledge efforts that your child makes to complete an assignment, and not just the result,\" Resnick said. \"Remind your child that everyone makes mistakes and that nobody is perfect.\"\n\nMore information\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics provides more tips to help children develop good homework habits.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "https://consumer.healthday.com/kids-health-information-23/parenting-health-news-525/expert-tips-to-make-homework-hour-less-stressful-703258.html", "image": "https://media.healthday.com/images/editorial/child_computer.jpg", "site_name": "Consumer HealthDay", "description": "Establish a routine and review assignment directions when kids come home, expert advises", "title": "Parents Can Take Steps to Help Make Homework Less Stressful"}, "description": "Establish a routine and review assignment directions when kids come home, expert advises", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=2.0,user-scalable=1"}, "article_summary": "When homework gets tough, it's important for parents to help children remain confident and understand that learning is a process.\nIf homework time seems excessive or if children clearly don't understand their homework and need total supervision to complete it, parents should share these concerns with their child's teacher.\nMONDAY, Oct. 5, 2015 (HealthDay News) -- Homework may be stressful for kids and parents alike, and it can be especially difficult for children with learning and behavior challenges, experts say.\nMore informationThe American Academy of Pediatrics provides more tips to help children develop good homework habits.\n\"Although most parents are not formally trained as educators, the homework time spent together can be used to teach a variety of learning strategies,\" said Resnick."}
