He would not appear to have the body type to blaze through the 400 meters, but he has been a revelation in that event this year as a freshman. He appears to have a bright future in both events, an unusual combo in track and field.\n\nMcClurkin surprised himself and his coaches last fall when he ran a 400 at practice without being in peak shape in 47.51 seconds.\n\n\u201cThey were like, \u2018All right, he\u2019s going to be pretty fast,\u2019 \u201d said McClurkin, who ran and jumped for Fountain-Fort Carson in high school.\n\n\u201cIncredibly fast,\u201d said Lindsey Malone, who coaches multi-events and jumps at CU. \u201cAt that point, I think his mind was more open to what could be accomplished this year.\u201d\n\nSure enough, McClurkin ran 47.78 at an indoor meet Feb. 13, putting him No. 3 on the all-time CU indoor list. He was 0.03 of a second off the mark needed to qualify for the NCAA Indoor Championships, and Malone has seen enough to believe McClurkin might have the talent to compete at the elite or Olympic level one day \u2014 in one or both events.\n\n\u201cThere are certain athletes, you look at them going, \u2018You have the potential to do this,\u2019 and he is one of those athletes,\u2019 \u201d Malone said. \u201cIt\u2019s an honor to get to say that, to be in the presence of someone you think could accomplish those goals. And it\u2019s incredibly intimidating, because that\u2019s a lot of responsibility on both sides.\u201d\n\nLike most military kids, McClurkin moved around a lot while growing up. His mother is retired military. His father is in artillery, stationed in El Paso, and is deploying soon to South Korea. McClurkin started track in grade school when the family was stationed at Fort Stewart, Ga.\n\n\u201cI was pretty good then,\u201d McClurkin said. \u201cMy nickname was Flash.\u201d\n\nIn high school he discovered his ability in the high jump, which was apparent when he leaped 6-7 his sophomore year.\n\n\u201cI was like, \u2018I could really go somewhere with this,\u2019 \u201d McClurkin said. \u201cI really started taking it more serious \u2014 started lifting more, really trying to have a love for the sport.\u201d\n\nFountain won Colorado 5A titles in 2014 and 2015 as McClurkin posted high school bests of 47.97 and 6-8. He wants to compete in both events through his college career, offering a \u201cguarantee\u201d that he will qualify for both events at the NCAA Outdoor Championships this spring.\n\nThe 400 meters is one of the most painful events in track. Because pacing is critical, McClurkin follows advice he received from his high school coach, breaking down each 100 meters by \u201cthe four P\u2019s,\u201d which are: push, pace, position and pray.\n\n\u201cThat last 100, you\u2019ve got to just pray you keep your form and keep strong,\u201d McClurkin said. \u201cThat last 20 to 25 meters is really starting to hurt.\u201d\n\nThe high jump is far more technical, incorporating four different somersaulting moves to get over a bar higher than the athlete is tall.\n\n\u201cIt takes consistency,\u201d McClurkin said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re coming up to the bar, you have to make sure your run is not too fast but controlled. Your curve, make sure you have an angle. And when you jump, make sure you drive straight up. Most people would think you have to bend your knee. It\u2019s kind of weird: You don\u2019t bend your knee at all. You just have knee drive and make sure you use your arms. Then you have to make sure you have that nice little bend around the bar.\u201d\n\nMalone is working hard with McClurkin on his jumping technique, breaking down the elements piece by piece, willing to sacrifice setbacks now to help him realize his full potential. It\u2019s a little like breaking down a golf swing to rebuild it.\n\n\u201cHigh school, they go out and have a meet every three days and they win and they have fun doing it,\u201d Malone said. \u201cIt\u2019s a three-month season. There\u2019s not much time to practice.\n\n\u201cWe have time. We have four years, five years maybe. That\u2019s the challenge. How can we break this down so we can develop this correctly from the bottom up? My ego has to take a slight shot, his ego has to take a slight shot, because we\u2019re going to be taking steps backward. The heights might not be there. It\u2019s not going to be as consistent. But if we develop this correctly, it\u2019s going to be the right foundation for years.\u201d\n\nDespite that process and the potential for what Malone calls \u201cparalysis by analysis,\u201d McClurkin surpassed his previous best high jump marks three times in the indoor season with a best of 6-9\u00be.\n\nHe also has an \u201cadorable\u201d personality, as Malone put it, funny and popular with teammates.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s very focused, he\u2019s very driven and he\u2019s very competitive \u2014 I love all of those things \u2014 but he does all of those things with a really light-hearted demeanor,\u201d Malone said. \u201cThat\u2019s how I think he\u2019s going to be so successful.\u201d\n\nJohn Meyer: jmeyer@denverpost.com or @johnmeyer", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Colorado freshman Duane McClurkin able to do rare double as high jumper, sprinter", "title": "Colorado freshman Duane McClurkin able to do rare double as high jumper, sprinter", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/04/16/colorado-freshman-duane-mcclurkin-able-to-do-rare-double-as-high-jumper-sprinter/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160416__BN20160417_C14_BNSP17MCCLURKINp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160416__BN20160417_C14_BNSP17MCCLURKINp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-04-16T18:58:18+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T03:39:15+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "University of Colorado"}, "article_summary": "\u201cMy nickname was Flash.\u201dIn high school he discovered his ability in the high jump, which was apparent when he leaped 6-7 his sophomore year.\n\u201cThey were like, \u2018All right, he\u2019s going to be pretty fast,\u2019 \u201d said McClurkin, who ran and jumped for Fountain-Fort Carson in high school.\nMcClurkin started track in grade school when the family was stationed at Fort Stewart, Ga.\u201cI was pretty good then,\u201d McClurkin said.\n\u201cHigh school, they go out and have a meet every three days and they win and they have fun doing it,\u201d Malone said.\nBecause pacing is critical, McClurkin follows advice he received from his high school coach, breaking down each 100 meters by \u201cthe four P\u2019s,\u201d which are: push, pace, position and pray."}
