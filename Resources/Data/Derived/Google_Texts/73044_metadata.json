With the dire risks sepsis poses to patient safety, it's counterproductive not to make use of the latest advances in research, Derek C. Angus, M.D., chair of Pitt's Department of Critical Care Medicine, told the Pittsburgh Business Times.\n\nSepis is now defined as a \"life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection.\"\n\n\"Our intent is that this definition results in greater consistency for epidemiologic studies, clinical trials and--perhaps most important--better recognition and more timely management of patients with, or at risk of developing, sepsis,\" he said.\n\nMeanwhile, providers are seeing positive results on sepsis at a micro level as well; at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, leaders used a $26 million innovation grant from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services to reduce sepsis mortality by more than 75 percent, according to Stat News. \"The solution wasn't fancy; there was no code to break,\" writes Dartmouth-Hitchcock President and CEO James N. Weinstein, M.D. \"We simply made sure that all clinicians were aware of the warning signs of sepsis and set a low threshold for starting treatment.\"\n\nThe facility also standardized treatment through the \"three-hour bundle.\" Under this system, within three hours of identifying a potential sepsis patient, workers take a blood sample to measure lactate, culture the blood to identify an infections, start the patient on a broad-spectrum antibiotic and keep the patient sufficiently hydrated.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read the JAMA article\n\n- here's the Business Journal article\n\n- read the Stat News article\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nThe sepsis threat: Why it's more 'insidious' than other conditions [Interview]\n\nSepsis prevention: Ohio collaborative develops protocols to attack deadly blood infection\n\nSepsis major driver of readmissions, mortality and costs\n\nSepsis rivals pneumonia, heart failure for readmissions\n\nWhat hospitals can do to tackle the deadly threat of sepsis\n\nSepsis contributes to half of hospital deaths\n\nEarly, personalized interventions could prevent sepsis readmissions\n\nHospitals, government take on sepsis and other drug-resistant infections\n\nSepsis mortality rates on the decline\n\nDeadly infections cost Medicare billions", "article_metadata": {"description": "An international task force has come up with a new definition of\u00a0sepsis\u00a0that could cut the infection risk.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "An international task force has come up with a new definition of\u00a0sepsis\u00a0that could cut the infection risk.", "title": "Sepsis: New definition may help cut risks of deadly infection", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/sepsis-new-definition-may-help-cut-risks-deadly-infection/2016-02-23", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Care Delivery,evidence-based protocols,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes,patient mortality,patient safety,Sepsis,University of Pittsburg Medical Center (UPMC)", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "article_summary": "An international task force has come up with a new definition of sepsis that could cut the infection risk.\nThe blood infection causes half of hospital deaths, and unlike other common infections, it requires multiple departments within an organization to combat the illness.\n\"We simply made sure that all clinicians were aware of the warning signs of sepsis and set a low threshold for starting treatment.\"\nSepis is now defined as a \"life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection.\"\n\"The solution wasn't fancy; there was no code to break,\" writes Dartmouth-Hitchcock President and CEO James N.
