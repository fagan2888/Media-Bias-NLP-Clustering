The answer to crony capitalism is less government,\u201d said Fiorina. \u201cAnd that is why we must repeal Obamacare. Because it is a classic example of crony capitalism.\u201d\n\nFiorina didn\u2019t hold back her opinions on some Republicans either.\n\n\u201cThis is what politicians do, they distract. President Obama doesn't have a plan to defeat ISIS, so he talks about gun control and climate change,\u201d said Fiorina. \u201cDonald Trump doesn't have a plan to defeat ISIS so he talks about banning Muslims.\u201d\n\nIn a new WMUR/CNN Granite State Poll released Tuesday, 32 percent of likely voters say they will vote for Trump in the New Hampshire Republican Primary as opposed to just 5 percent of support for Fiorina.\n\nFiorina mapped out her blueprint for America\u2019s success, which she says includes defeating the terror group ISIS, repealing Obamacare and securing the border.\n\nOne town hall attendee asked Fiorina why she didn't support clemency towards undocumented citizens in the country for peaceful purposes.\n\n\u201cOn this, respectfully I must disagree,\u201d Fiorina responded. \u201cAnd I will tell you why: When we become a nation that does not enforce the laws we have, then no one cares about the laws we have.\u201d\n\nFiorina will be in the Granite State until Friday and she will visit six additional New Hampshire towns.\n\nFor a full list of events visit the WMUR Candidate Tracker.\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"category": "Politics", "ib-analytics": "data", "item-publish-date": "Wed, 09 Dec 2015 23:30:13 EST", "generator": "ibPublish 2", "author": "Stephanie Woods", "og": {"site_name": "WMUR", "description": "Republican presidential candidate Carly Fiorina started a three-day swing through the Granite State Wednesday with two town halls in Lebanon.", "title": "Fiorina speaks at town hall events in Lebanon", "url": "http://www.wmur.com/politics/fiorina-speaks-at-town-hall-events-in-lebanon/36888220", "image": "http://www.wmur.com/image/view/-/36887872/medRes/2/-/maxh/630/maxw/1200/-/x6qlvh/-/img-Carly-Fiorina-holds-town-hall-in-West-Lebanon.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.wmur.com/politics/fiorina-speaks-at-town-hall-events-in-lebanon/36888220", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "wmur://content/article/36888220", "iphone": "wmur://content/article/36888220", "googleplay": "wmur://content/article/36888220"}, "name": {"ipad": "wmur", "iphone": "wmur", "googleplay": "wmur"}, "id": {"ipad": 504646663, "iphone": 504646663, "googleplay": "com.hearst.android.wmur"}}, "site": "@wmur9", "card": "app"}, "al": {"android": {"url": "wmur://content/article/36888220", "app_name": "wmur", "package": "com.hearst.android.wmur"}, "ios": {"url": "wmur://content/article/36888220", "app_store_id": 504646663, "app_name": "wmur"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 98665743246}, "vr": {"canonical": "http://www.wmur.com/politics/fiorina-speaks-at-town-hall-events-in-lebanon/36888220"}, "google-site-verification": "xTJFxn8Gm6mXV5ugnbTb198craV_CkoMGMqQyL4EfS4", "keywords": "Carly Fiorina, Republican, FITN, NH Politics, GOP", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/StephanieWoodsWMUR"}, "news_keywords": "Carly Fiorina, Republican, FITN, NH Politics, GOP", "description": "Republican presidential candidate Carly Fiorina started a three-day swing through the Granite State Wednesday with two town halls in Lebanon."}, "article_summary": "Republican presidential candidate Carly Fiorina started a three-day swing through the Granite State Wednesday with two town halls in Lebanon.\nOne town hall attendee asked Fiorina why she didn't support clemency towards undocumented citizens in the country for peaceful purposes.\nMore than 150 people packed a Lebanon auditorium to hear Fiorina speak, but some also came for her unrestrained opinions on prominent Democrats.\nDespite getting just five percent of support in the latest WMUR poll, Fiorina said she will take New Hampshire and take down Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton.\nPresident Obama doesn't have a plan to defeat ISIS, so he talks about gun control and climate change,\u201d said Fiorina."}
