You do the expansion,\u2019\u201d said Matt Salo, executive director of the National Association of Medicaid Directors. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the points of leverage that CMS now has.\u201d\n\nTexas received the 2011 Medicaid waiver in part to reimburse hospitals for care provided to patients who couldn't pay. Two years later, state leaders under Gov. Rick Perry declined to expand Medicaid, criticizing the program as inefficient.\n\nThat left a \u201ccoverage gap\u201d of more than 1 million Texans too poor to receive federal subsidies for private health insurance but too rich to qualify for coverage under Texas\u2019 current, restrictive Medicaid requirements.\n\nNow, policy analysts on the left and right say, the feds are likely to be less sympathetic to Texas\u2019 request for another waiver to help pay for uncompensated care.\n\nA similar tug-of-war is playing out in Florida, said Joan Alker, executive director at the Center for Children and Families at Georgetown University. In May, the federal government renewed Florida\u2019s waiver to reimburse hospitals for just one year, rather than the standard three, \u201cwhich was very unusual,\u201d Alker said.\n\n\u201cTo me, that was a clear signal that they were saying, 'We\u2019re not going to give you this money forever because these Medicaid expansion dollars are on the table, and you\u2019re not taking them,'\u201d she said. \u201cWhy would you take one pot of federal money and not the other one, which is actually a better deal for the state?\u201d\n\nTexas' Legislature has only moved farther to the right since its 2013 battle over Medicaid expansion, and lawmakers are unlikely to budge. State Sen. Charles Schwertner, R-Georgetown, the chairman of the Health and Human Services Committee, has said alternative programs to expand coverage merit \"honest discussion,\" but that \"expanding Medicaid in its current form is a nonstarter for Texas.\"\n\nJohn Davidson of the Texas Public Policy Foundation, a conservative think tank, agreed.\n\n\u201cIf you expand Medicaid without significantly reforming it, you will break the program,\u201d Davidson said. But he expects the federal government to use the waiver renewal to try to force Medicaid expansion, because \u201cit would be a feather in the administration\u2019s cap to see that happen here because Texas is such a large state.\u201d\n\nRepresentatives for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn Texas, Medicaid covers 3.7 million poor, disabled and elderly people, including children, and costs roughly $40 billion per year, of which the federal government pays 60 percent.\n\nMore than 700,000 Texans signed up for health insurance on the federal exchange in 2013, the most of any state. That figure paled in comparison to the more than 6 million Texans who lacked health insurance in 2012, as tallied by the U.S. census. By not expanding Medicaid, Texas is forgoing as much as $8 billion in federal assistance each year, according to the left-leaning Center for Public Policy Priorities.\n\nRepublican lawmakers considered an alternative \u201cTexas solution\u201d to Medicaid expansion during the 2013 legislative session that would have drastically reformed the program. That proposal failed, and ultimately the Legislature approved a requirement that the Health and Human Services Commission receive legislative approval before expanding Medicaid eligibility.\n\nState Rep. John Zerwas, R-Richmond, one of the lawmakers who advocated for the \"Texas solution,\" said the Legislature would revisit coverage expansion during the session.\n\n\"It still behooves us as a Legislature to figure out, what's the policy going to be around these people?\" he said. \"I'll be the first to say that finding a solution for these million and a half people is important.\"\n\nAnd the transformational waiver from 2011 is already a source of some conflict with the federal government. CMS is currently withholding $75 million in waiver money that Texas used to reimburse private hospitals while federal officials review whether any rules were broken.\n\nTiffany Hogue, policy director for the Texas Organizing Project, which has worked to get Texans to sign up for health coverage on the exchange, said Medicaid expansion would be a top priority for her group during the legislative session.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely going to be a battle cry for us,\u201d she said. \u201cThe sheer number of uninsured \u2014 that\u2019s daunting.\u201d\n\nStill, Alker said she was skeptical that Texas would expand Medicaid anytime soon.\n\n\u201cI remind myself when the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program was passed in 1997, Texas was the last state in the country to pick up the program,\u201d she said. \u201cThat may be instructive moving forward.\u201d\n\nDisclosure: The Texas Public Policy Foundation is a corporate sponsor of The Texas Tribune.
