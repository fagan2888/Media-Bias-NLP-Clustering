Ciaramitaro, vice president for health care enrollment services at H&R Block.\n\nStan Dorn, a health policy expert at the Urban Institute, said: \u201cIt makes a huge amount of sense to involve tax preparers in the process of enrolling uninsured individuals into subsidized coverage. They are in the business of filling out forms for consumers. And they already collect 90 percent of the information needed to get help paying for health coverage.\u201d\n\nJackson Hewitt, H&R Block and Intuit offer their clients what amounts to a health insurance checkup. H&R Block calls it a tax and health care review. Jackson Hewitt calls it an \u201cA.C.A. X-ray.\u201d Intuit has a \u201chealth care subsidy calculator.\u201d\n\nIn addition, the tax preparation services teamed up with online insurance brokers to help clients sign up for health coverage. Jackson Hewitt has been working with GetInsured, H&R Block with GoHealth and TurboTax with e-Health.\n\nThe online tax tools make clear that, for some consumers, insurance premiums are substantially higher than the penalty for going without coverage this year.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIf, for example, a husband and wife, each 33 years old, live in Florida with no children and a household income of $60,000 a year, TurboTax\u2019s subsidy calculator tells them: \u201cThe lowest-cost health insurance will cost you $363 out-of-pocket per month. Alternatively, you\u2019ll pay a penalty of $33 per month.\u201d\n\nAt H&R Block, Mr. Ciaramitaro said, premiums of more than $100 a month appeared to create \u201ca psychological barrier for many clients.\u201d\n\nConsumers can receive premium tax credits in advance, in monthly installments, before they file their tax returns, and they can receive the full credit even if they do not owe any federal income taxes.\n\nFour-fifths of people buying insurance on the exchanges qualify for subsidies, expected to average $4,400 a year for each person who receives assistance in 2014.\n\nThe tax credits are paid directly from the Treasury to insurance companies on behalf of consumers. People with lower incomes generally receive larger tax credits. If their incomes go up, they may be entitled to less assistance.\n\nTwo provisions of the health care law will hit taxpayers at this time next year. Some will owe penalties for having been uninsured. And some will find that they owe money to the Internal Revenue Service because they received too much in tax credit payments.\n\n\u201cA substantial number of people will be surprised,\u201d said Catherine E. Livingston, who was the health care counsel at the I.R.S. from 2010 to 2013. \u201cIf you have an increase in income this year, it could mean that you will owe money to the government when you file your tax return next April. Or you may receive a smaller refund.\u201d\n\nConsumers should notify the health insurance marketplace if their income or family size changes, said Ms. Livingston, a lawyer at Jones Day.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn a guide to the health care law, Jackson Hewitt tells consumers: \u201cYou don\u2019t want to have to pay back part of your tax credit at the end of the year. This might happen if you don\u2019t report your changes.\u201d Higher income or a smaller family could mean lower subsidies.\n\nTax professionals say their expertise and experience with tax law prepare them well to help consumers through the labyrinth of the health care law and regulations.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re the Affordable Care Act experts,\u201d Intuit says in promoting TurboTax. \u201cAs with all tax laws, we know the new health care law inside and out.\u201d\n\nJackson Hewitt emphasizes that it can help people apply for Medicaid at any time of year. And it will help consumers obtain subsidized private insurance after the March 31 sign-up deadline by requesting a \u201cspecial enrollment period.\u201d\n\nTax experts are also telling clients that the penalties for going without insurance could turn out to be larger than they realize.\n\n\u201cMost people have $95 in their head,\u201d Mr. Ciaramitaro said. \u201cBut for the vast majority of people, the potential penalty will be higher.\u201d\n\nThe penalty this year is either a fixed dollar amount \u2014 $95 per adult \u2014 or 1 percent of household income above the \u201cfiling threshold,\u201d whichever is greater. The threshold this year is $10,150 for individuals and $20,300 for married couples filing joint returns. The penalties are scheduled to increase in future years.\n\nThe White House is celebrating the fact that 7.5 million people signed up for private coverage through the exchanges. But in tax service offices this spring, the perspective is a bit different.\n\n\u201cThe president met his goal,\u201d Ms. Burnell said, \u201cbut many, many people we see still need health coverage.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140414114859, "twitter": {"description": "As tax professionals help with tax returns, they are also offering advice on costs of premiums and potential fines under the Affordable Care Act.", "title": "Tax Preparers\u2019 New Role: Health-Coverage Advisers", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/15/us/politics/new-role-for-tax-preparers-health-coverage-advisers.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002821567"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/15/us/TAX/TAX-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/15/us/politics/new-role-for-tax-preparers-health-coverage-advisers.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002821567", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/15/us/politics/new-role-for-tax-preparers-health-coverage-advisers.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "us/politics", "channels": "NytNow", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/politics/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "April 14, 2014", "edt": "NewYork", "keywords": "Tax Preparers and Preparation,Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010),Health Insurance and Managed Care,Income Tax,Law and Legislation,Tax Credits  Deductions and Exemptions", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Robert Pear", "SCG": "politics", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "byl": "By ROBERT PEAR", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "As tax professionals help with tax returns, they are also offering advice on costs of premiums and potential fines under the Affordable Care Act.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/15/us/TAX/TAX-thumbStandard.jpg", "description": "As tax professionals help with tax returns, they are also offering advice on costs of premiums and potential fines under the Affordable Care Act.", "CG": "us", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "April 14, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/p/robert_pear/index.html", "section": "Politics", "modified": "2014-04-15", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/politics/index.jsonp", "tag": "Tax Credits, Deductions and Exemptions", "published": "2014-04-14", "section-taxonomy-id": "23FD6C8B-62D5-4CEA-A331-6C2A9A1223BE"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "slug": "15tax", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20140415124150, "hdl_p": "Tax Preparers\u2019 New Role: Health-Coverage Advisers", "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/15/us/politics/new-role-for-tax-preparers-health-coverage-advisers.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/15/us/TAX/TAX-videoSixteenByNine1050.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "As tax professionals help with tax returns, they are also offering advice on costs of premiums and potential fines under the Affordable Care Act.", "title": "Tax Preparers\u2019 New Role: Health-Coverage Advisers"}, "pdate": 20140414, "des": "Tax Credits, Deductions and Exemptions", "articleid": 100000002821567, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Tax Preparers\u2019 New Role: Health-Coverage Advisers", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/15/us/TAX/TAX-thumbLarge.jpg", "PST": "News"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd23fe\"", "article_summary": "Tax professionals say their expertise and experience with tax law prepare them well to help consumers through the labyrinth of the health care law and regulations.\nTwo provisions of the health care law will hit taxpayers at this time next year.\n\u201cA substantial number of people will be surprised,\u201d said Catherine E.
