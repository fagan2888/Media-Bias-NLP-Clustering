There is a \u201chope\u201d-powered hysteria surrounding his campaign, and bursting the \u201chope\u201d bubble can produce a fierce backlash. The Sanders \u201chope\u201d explosion is so fierce because capitalism has become a hopeless place.\n\nHope can be positive by pushing people into political action, but it\u2019s also exploited by the establishment as shiny bait. Obama, for example, fished for votes using \u201chope\u201d and reeled in the presidency.\n\nHe then clubbed \u201chope\u201d senseless by betraying his promises, continuing war and maintaining the domestic policies of the 1%. Hope was so thoroughly thrashed that a new messiah of hope was needed to cure the Obama-fortified hopelessness.\n\nBernie\u2019s version of hope is deeper than Obama\u2019s shallow PR electoral campaign, but under capitalism real \u201chope\u201d isn\u2019t a simple recipe, and Bernie is missing some key ingredients, most notably \u201canti-imperialism,\u201d which is exemplified in Bernie\u2019s reactionary foreign policy positions.\n\nImperialism can be loosely defined as the multitude of actions that maintain the U.S. global empire. Most Americans don\u2019t realize the true political depth of imperialism \u2014 or don\u2019t even know they live in the largest empire in world history, which adds urgency to the educating and organizing around this issue.\n\nSome on the left would dismiss anti-imperialism as a \u201csecondary\u201d issue, accusing those who insist on its inclusion as \u201cdogmatic\u201d or \u201cpurist.\u201d \u201cBernie is doing so many great things,\u201d they insist, \u201cthat focusing on his weak points is counter-productive.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s of course perfectly reasonable that many progressive/liberal and working class people would be attracted to Sanders\u2019 platform. But socialists/revolutionaries must have a broader perspective. Imperialism is, in some ways, the beating heart of U.S. capitalism: a central power of the \u201cbillionaire class\u201d that stops progress abroad while blocking progress at home.\n\nThe rabidly pro-imperialist section of the establishment is the most powerful and class-conscious section of the ruling class, with deep roots in the military industrial-complex. It also has deep, racist roots in the South, where military enlistees remain vastly over-represented, and where many military bases are named after pro-slavery civil war heroes. This is the most hideously reactionary section of the establishment, who\u2019d be the first to support fascism domestically, since they\u2019ve already supported it in various forms abroad.\n\nThe U.S. pro-imperialist establishment has helped to create a network of global military alliances that funnel weapons internationally, while cash flows globally into the hands of the 1% via free trade agreements crafted by the pro-imperialist establishment.\n\nWithout this imperialism the exports or markets of the largest U.S. corporations would suffer: including the big banks, big oil, big healthcare/insurance corporations, defense contractors (the arms industry), agro-corporations, tech firms, etc.\n\nBernie\u2019s failure to confront this specific, crucial power of the \u201cbillionaire class\u201d isn\u2019t a \u201cblind spot\u201d of his politics, since imperialism is like a tank parked in your living room, too big to ignore. By consciously allying with this imperialist-section of the establishment, Sanders has exposed himself as a push over, whenever the imperialists decide its push comes to shove over war.\n\nThis imperialist pressure to \u201cfall in line\u201d extends beyond war. Sanders helped write and gave crucial political support to Obamacare, betraying his longstanding \u201cdedication\u201d to universal health care.\n\nSanders knew that Obamacare was not \u201ca step in the right direction,\u201d but a decision to spend all of Obama\u2019s political capital on a scheme that strengthens the health care/pharmaceutical corporations that act as the biggest barrier to universal health care. If elected, President Sanders would abandon much of his campaign promises and \u201cfall in line\u201d as quickly and ingloriously as Obama did.\n\nSanders surely knows that foreign policy cannot be separated from domestic policy. They are two sides of the same coin that directly affect each other. What happens abroad affects what is possible domestically, and vice versa.\n\nFor example, the U.S. imperialist project \u2014 via \u201cdefense\u201d spending \u2014\u2014 drains the U.S. national budget (57% of discretionary spending), which could otherwise actually fund the things Bernie is proposing; universal health care and fully fund public schools, free college education, job creation, etc.\n\nA Harvard study estimated that the full cost of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars alone will cost over $4 trillion, a number that is already increasing as the wars get indefinitely extended. This is a big reason why public schools are being shuttered and health insurance remains unaffordable or absent for tens of millions of people.\n\nThis kind of imperialist spending has effectively vetoed the job and social programs that people would enthusiastically vote for. This imperialist veto over domestic programs exemplifies how oppression abroad limits your freedoms at home. True freedom and economic security cannot be won in a bubble within an international economic system, especially within a U.S. imperialist system.\n\nImperialism also directly affects race relations in the United States. The U.S. establishment finds it acceptable to commit atrocities against people of color abroad because people of color at home live in dehumanized conditions and are treated as second-class citizens.\n\nThe imperialist actions abroad reinforce the oppression domestically, the most recent example being the Muslim people who are bombed overseas and then discriminated against at home. This racism is purposely exacerbated by politicians and the media, serving to reinforce the position of the establishment by dividing working class people in both affected nations.\n\nThe same dynamic is used in Africa, where the underlying racism against African Americans is projected abroad, aiding and abetting the regimes that committed the Rwandan and Congo genocide. These U.S.-supported atrocities are then blamed on the \u201cinexplicably savage\u201d behavior of African \u201ctribalism\u201d, a racist lie used to legitimize the racism, mass incarceration, job discrimination, and crushing poverty experienced by African Americans.\n\nIt\u2019s no exaggeration to say that U.S. imperialism is the most politically reactionary force in the world, directly and deeply shaping governments and militaries/police across the world that then use these U.S.-made weapons against their own citizens.\n\nFor example, a recent article in Salon was named \u201c35 Countries where the U.S. has supported Fascists, Drug Lords, and Terrorists.\u201d The point is well made; U.S. imperialism artificially shoves governments across the globe far to the right, preventing these governments from becoming examples or allies for social movements within the United States.\n\nThe 700+ U.S. military bases across the globe directly affect the politics of every hosting nation, while U.S. imperialist political pressure is also applied via military alliances (NATO), arms sales, training military/police, supporting dictators, supporting military coups, proxy wars, direct military intervention, etc.\n\nSupporting Bernie Sanders means ignoring \u2014 or minimizing \u2014 his imperialism, since political campaigns are won through cheerleading not criticism. And by ignoring Bernie\u2019s foreign policy \u2014 because it might \u201churt the campaign\u201d \u2014 imperialism is reinforced through valuable political cover. The most powerful section of the U.S. establishment thus benefits.\n\nSome Sanders supporters might respond; \u201cat least his foreign policy is better than Hillary\u2019s.\u201d But Sanders himself has been unable to provide a real argument to support this claim during the ongoing debates.\n\nWhen Sanders attempted to frame Hillary as \u201cpro-regime change\u201d in relation to the catastrophe she created in Libya, Hillary pointed out that Sanders voted \u201cyes\u201d to support that regime change. As the war machine rolled into Libya Sanders wasn\u2019t a speed bump; he was a lubricant. Clinton and Sanders both have Libyan blood on their hands.\n\nSanders has Afghan blood on his hands too, having voted for the invasion of the now-endless Afghan war that triggered the beginning of the flurry of Middle East wars. And while Sanders brags about voting \u201cno\u201d for the 2003 Iraq war, his vote soon morphed into a \u201cyes,\u201d by his several votes for the ongoing funding of the war/occupation.\n\nSanders also voted \u201cyes\u201d for the U.S.-led NATO destruction of Yugoslavia, and supports the brutal Israeli military regime that uses U.S. weapons to slaughter Palestinians.\n\nWhen it was announced that Obama was choosing sides and funneling guns to the Syrian rebels \u2014 thus exacerbating and artificially extending the conflict \u2014 Bernie was completely silent; a silence that helped destroy Syria and lead to the biggest refugee crisis since World War II.\n\nSanders is consistently on the wrong side of history; he\u2019s also been a direct accomplice to a series of massive war crimes.\n\nSanders often uses weak rhetoric to mitigate his imperialism. On his campaign website he says that the U.S. needs a \u201cstrong national defense infrastructure\u201d and a \u201cstrong defense system,\u201d but adds the caveat that he\u2019s \u201cconcerned\u201d about the military budget, and wants \u201caccountability\u201d for the enormous amounts that are spent. Obama the candidate spoke more clearly about war and peace than Sanders does.\n\nHighlighting Sanders imperialism is especially important because the left has been repeatedly duped by imperialist wars in recent years, to the point that imperialism is becoming increasingly ignored, and consequently strengthened.\n\nLarge sections of the left were silent about the destruction of Yugoslavia, Libya, Afghanistan and Syria. They were blissfully ignorant of the ongoing imperialist adventures throughout Africa, most spectacularly in Rwanda, Sudan, Somalia and the Congo. The worst dictators in Africa \u2014 for example in Ethiopia, Uganda and Rwanda \u2014 are \u201cgood friends\u201d of the United States.\n\nBy not giving adequate focus to the U.S. foreign military adventures, valuable political cover is given to allow these wars to continue. The U.S. anti-war movement was mostly silent about Obama\u2019s imperialism while two historically important countries of the Middle East \u2014 Libya and Syria \u2014 were obliterated.\n\nBy not educating and organizing against imperialism, it\u2019s impossible to make alliances with forces fighting imperialism abroad. Creating international alliances has a long tradition among the left among unions, Black liberation, and the socialist/communist movements.\n\nThere have also been powerful connections that helped curb apartheid South Africa, strengthen the Venezuelan revolution and empower Palestinians against the apartheid Israeli government.\n\nHowever, the people on the ground in the Middle East who preferred that the U.S. not destroy their nations, have had little solidarity with people in the United States. In fact, the United States in many of their eyes is the number one enemy, which in turn makes them think that terrorism against U.S. citizens is justified.\n\nUltimately, the nationalist demands of the Sanders\u2019 campaign cannot be achieved while simultaneously allowing international imperialism to thrive. Imperialism is a bogeyman that haunts social progress, re-appearing in countless forms to keep resources flowing endlessly into wars abroad that stunt domestic spending and distract from working class demands. A new military \u201ccrisis\u201d will always strive to take priority over domestic considerations.\n\nIt\u2019s obligatory for the left to challenge imperialism by any means necessary, waging campaigns and raising demands to stop foreign aggression.\n\nBy lowering our voices in response to Bernie\u2019s campaign, an opportunity is missed to amplify our voices in strategic interventions such as the successful Black Lives Matter actions at Sanders\u2019 rallies. Silence on these issues always benefits imperialism at the expense of everybody else.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "www.counterpunch.org", "description": "Critiquing Bernie Sanders from the left can be a lonely project.
