Washington's Warner Theatre is getting ready to host The 2014 BET Honors.

The show will take place Saturday at the theater in downtown Washington. BET Honors highlights African Americans performing at top levels in the areas of music, literature, entertainment, education and more.

BET announced in January that singer Aretha Franklin and Motown founder Berry Gordy will be honored during the show. Rapper-actor Ice Cube, American Express CEO Ken Chenault and photographer and video artist Carrie Mae Weems will also receive tributes at the event.

Actor and comedian Wayne Brady will host the special, which will air Feb. 24.
