“The rest of the community does not have to be concerned because of this incident there or people who live around the community center do not have to be concerned," said Erme. "If people have any questions or concerns we do have a hotline that people could call.”



The number for the hotline is (330) 926-5795. Screenings for students and staff will be offered at the school beginning next week.
