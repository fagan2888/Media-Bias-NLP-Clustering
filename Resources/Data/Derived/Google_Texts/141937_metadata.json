Neither believe in Obamacare. But Ted Cruz is trying to repeal it. And Bernie Sanders is trying to save it.\n\nAnd therein lies one major difference between Cruz and Sanders.\n\nCruz is a market based Texas Tea Partier. He would let the market rule in insurance. And he fights for what he believes in.\n\nSanders is a Vermont based socialist. He would get the insurance companies out of game and replace all those payers with a single payer national health insurance system.\n\nBut while Cruz spent 21 hours on the Senate floor last month fighting for what he believes in, Sanders spent 21 minutes yesterday fighting for what he says he doesn\u2019t believe in \u2014 Obamacare.\n\nCruz spent 21 hours straight last month in a filibuster calling for the repeal of Obamacare.\n\nSanders would also repeal Obamacare and replace it with single payer.\n\nBut Sanders won\u2019t take to the Senate floor and fight for single payer, because even though he calls himself an independent, he\u2019s tied to the Democrats in Congress.\n\nAs such, he is bound to defend a law he doesn\u2019t believe in.\n\nSanders calls Obamacare \u201ca good Republican program,\u201d which it is \u2014 based on Mitt Romney\u2019s health care law in Massachusetts.\n\nSo why didn\u2019t Sanders take to the floor of the Senate when Cruz was holding his filibuster and say to Cruz \u2014 I agree with you, we need to repeal Obamacare \u2014 and replace it with single payer?\n\nAnd then engage Cruz in a debate?\n\nSanders could have put single payer back on the map.\n\nWhy didn\u2019t he do that?\n\nBecause like all the single payer Democrats in the House and Senate \u2014 Sanders, despite calling himself an independent \u2014 is bound and gagged by the dictates of Obama and the Democratic Party.\n\nYesterday, Sanders spent 21 minutes or so on the floor of the Senate defending a law he doesn\u2019t believe in.\n\nOr as Sanders put it yesterday \u2014 \u201cI don\u2019t believe in Obamacare.\u201d\n\nThen why are you defending it, Bernie?", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 3.8.14", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "He would get the insurance companies out of game and replace all those payers with a single payer national health insurance system.\nSanders would also repeal Obamacare and replace it with single payer.\nBecause like all the single payer Democrats in the House and Senate \u2014 Sanders, despite calling himself an independent \u2014 is bound and gagged by the dictates of Obama and the Democratic Party.\nSanders could have put single payer back on the map.\nBut Sanders won\u2019t take to the Senate floor and fight for single payer, because even though he calls himself an independent, he\u2019s tied to the Democrats in Congress."}
