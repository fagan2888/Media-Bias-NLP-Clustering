Perhaps the most troubling is the one that the law itself is creating by wreaking havoc on an already shaky employment landscape.\n\n\n\nMore specifically, stunning job loss.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office reported last week that the combination of taxes and subsidies in the law \u201ccreates a disincentive for people to work.\u201d The report predicted the mix would lead to fewer hours worked, costing the equivalent of 2.3 million jobs.\n\n[pullquote]\n\nIn the report, the non-partisan CBO says workers will scale back their productivity after taking into consideration the subsidies available from the federal government to make insurance more affordable for low- and middle-income people. The more money people make, the lower their subsidies. Thus, why bust your bum in a job you don\u2019t like when you can get more financial assistance for doing less?\n\nBut work isn\u2019t supposed to be fun. That\u2019s why they call it work. Democrats, on the other hand, see this situation as freeing.\n\n\u201cOpportunity created by affordable, quality health insurance allows families in America to make a decision about how they will work, or if they will work,\u201d Jay Carney said.\n\nThere it is, America. The new dirty word in Democratic circles: work. The war against it has officially begun.\n\n\n\nThe new option to the oppressive, unfun reality of work is \u201cdon\u2019t work,\u201d because the government has got your back. Of course, when Democrats talk about this newfound freedom, they won\u2019t tell you that it comes at a cost.\n\nFor whom? For people who choose to work and who will be forced to pay for people who opt out of the labor market altogether. You know, those artists and musicians who are emancipated from what Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid call \u201cjob lock.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWe see it as an entrepreneurial bill,\u201d Pelosi famously said in 2010, \u201ca bill that says to someone, if you want to be creative and be a musician or whatever, you can leave your work, focus on your talent, your skill, your passion, your aspirations because you will have health care.\u201d\n\n\n\nIf you think she\u2019s going after the artist vote, think again. What people need to realize is that President Obama, Nancy Pelosi and most liberals in office who gave us ObamaCare don\u2019t care about the success of the economy.\n\nThey don\u2019t care about the unemployment rate or even higher underemployment rate.\n\nThey don\u2019t care about growth. And they don\u2019t care about this CBO report. People will go into the exchanges where health plans are de facto government plans, and years from now they will be actual government plans.\n\n\n\nPlainly put, their primary goal is to make people dependent on the government. So, by liberal standards, this reduction in work is a blessing, not a curse.\n\n\n\nTell that to women. According to the Wall Street Journal, \"More than one in six men ages 25 to 54, prime working years, don't have jobs\u2014a total of 10.4 million. Some are looking for jobs; many aren't.\"\n\nAnd the problem is not just a lack of jobs. \"Many of the available jobs don't pay enough to get men to take them, particularly if securing a job requires moving, long commutes or surrendering government benefits.\"\n\n\n\nThe direct casualties of able-bodied men dropping out of the workforce are women. If men aren\u2019t working, they won\u2019t be inclined to date or marry.\n\nMen link their happiness to professional success and stability. With more men out of work, they will be less likely to marry, want to start families and be providers. And women will be left footing the bill or without stable mates, which will have a direct effect on women\u2019s happiness. The societal effects of this will be hugely transformative for the sexes.\n\n\n\nThis Washington war on work is actually a war on women\u2014and the men they love.\n\nBut if you listen to a Democrat, we work too hard anyway.\n\n\n\n\"If you look at international comparisons country by country, Americans work way more that the average of industrialized countries around the world,\" said Rep. Keith Ellison, (D-Minn.).\n\n\n\nHe said the report showing fewer work hours gives us the chance \"to look at our work/life balance,\" which he described as \"a great opportunity\u201d to stay home and cook dinner. Great news for Stouffer\u2019s. Bad news for the rest of us.\n\nPerhaps the biggest question remains: if work is so bad, then why not enforce the employer mandate?\n\nJust this week the administration delayed the mandate yet again fearing that employers will let go of staff, not hire or move employees to part time status because of the law. If ObamaCare liberates them from the strangling ball and chain of gainful employment, why continue to delay a mandate that will keep more people in these jobs?\n\nIsn\u2019t delaying the mandate a tacit admission that ObamaCare is a war on work and workers? And isn\u2019t, according to Democrats\u2019 logic of last week, less work a good thing?\n\nSeems like even they don\u2019t believe their own hype.\n\n\n\nAmerica is the greatest nation in the world because it works, literally and figuratively. We shouldn\u2019t strive to be like other countries by launching a full frontal assault on work. In fact, we should be empowered to do everything we can to create more jobs and more workers, not go to war with them.\n\nWho knew, when Joe Biden boasted that ObamaCare was a \u201cbig bleeping deal,\u201d he was right?\n\nAndrea Tantaros currently serves as co-host of Fox News Channel's Outnumbered (Weekdays at Noon/ET).
