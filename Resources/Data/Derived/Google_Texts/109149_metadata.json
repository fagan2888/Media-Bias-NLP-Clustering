It is the finest educational institution in the world, everyone tells us. Indeed, to judge by the praise that is heaped upon it, the American university may be our best institution, period. With its peaceful quadrangles and prosperity-bringing innovation, the university is more spiritually satisfying than the church, more nurturing than the family, more productive than any industry.\n\nThe university deals in dreams. Like other utopias\u2014like Walt Disney World, like the ambrosial lands shown in perfume advertisements, like the competitive Valhalla of the Olympics\u2014the university is a place of wish fulfillment and infinite possibility. It is the four-year luxury cruise that will transport us gently across the gulf of class. It is the wrought-iron gateway to the land of lifelong affluence.\n\nIt is not the university itself that tells us these things; everyone does. It is the president of the United States. It is our most respected political commentators and economists. It is our business heroes and our sports heroes. It is our favorite teacher and our guidance counselor and maybe even our own Tiger Mom. They\u2019ve been to the university, after all. They know.\n\nWhen we reach the end of high school, we approach the next life, the university life, in the manner of children writing letters to Santa. Oh, we promise to be so very good. We open our hearts to the beloved institution. We get good grades. We do our best on standardized tests. We earnestly list our first, second, third choices. We tell them what we want to be when we grow up. We confide our wishes. We stare at the stock photos of smiling students, we visit the campus, and we find, always, that it is so very beautiful.\n\nAnd when that fat acceptance letter comes\u2014oh, it is the greatest moment of personal vindication most of us have experienced. Our hard work has paid off. We have been chosen.\n\nThen several years pass, and one day we wake up to discover there is no Santa Claus. Somehow, we have been had. We are a hundred thousand dollars in debt, and there is no clear way to escape it. We have no prospects to speak of. And if those damned dreams of ours happened to have taken a particularly fantastic turn and urged us to get a PhD, then the learning really begins.\n\nCollege and Mammon Both\n\nGo back to the beginning, back to the days when people first understood a character-building college diploma to be the ticket to middle-class success. We would forge a model republic of citizen-students, who would redeem the merit badges of academic achievement for spots in the upper reaches of corporate capitalism. The totems of the modern American striver were to be the University Credential and the Corner Office, and prosperity would reward the ablest.\n\nAnd so the story remains today, despite everything that has happened in the realms of the corporation and the university. We might worry from time to time about the liberal professors who infest the academy, but school is still where you go to \u201cwrite your destiny,\u201d to use President Obama\u2019s 2010 description of education generally. Go to college, or else your destiny will be written by someone else. The bachelor\u2019s degree that universities issue is a \u201ccredential\u201d that\u2019s \u201ca prerequisite for 21st century jobs,\u201d says the White House website. Obama himself equates education with upward mobility\u2014more schooling equals more success\u2014as well as with national greatness. \u201cThe kinds of opportunities that are open to you will be determined by how far you go in school,\u201d he declared a few years ago.\n\nIn other words, the farther you go in school, the farther you\u2019ll go in life. And at a time when other countries are competing with us like never before, when students around the world are working harder than ever, and doing better than ever, your success in school will also help determine America\u2019s success in the twenty-first century.\n\nThis is commonplace and unremarkable to the point of being utterly hackneyed. Everyone says this. It is obvious. Thomas Friedman, the New York Times foreign affairs columnist who has refashioned himself into the Lord Protector of Learning in recent years, says the same thing, constantly: you\u2019d better have the schooling and the skills that the entrepreneurial class demands if you want to make even a minimal living. The higher education mantra is possibly the greatest clich\u00e9 in American public life.\n\nAnd so the dreams proliferate. Education is the competitive advantage that might save our skins as we compete more and more directly with China and Vietnam and the Philippines, the journalists say. Education is what explains income inequality, chime the economists, and more education is what will roll it back. In fact, education is just about the only way we can justify being paid for our work at all; it is the only quantifiable input that makes us valuable or gives us \u201cskills.\u201d\n\nQuantifiable, yes, but only vaguely. No one really knows the particular contents of the education that is supposed to save us. It is, again, a dream, a secret formula, a black box into which we pour money and out of which comes uplift or enrichment or wish-fulfillment. How a college education manages to do these marvelous things\u2014Is it calculus? Is it classics?\u2014is a subject of hot controversy. All we know for sure is that people who go to college are affluent; it follows naturally that if you send more people to college, you will have yourself a more affluent country.\n\nIndeed, to judge by the popular understanding of the dream-institution, the whole thing might as well be some sort of self-perpetuating cabal, akin to Skull and Bones or Sigma Chi. Maybe college is able to work its magic because college grads hire only college grads, and after decades of \u201cnetworking\u201d\u2014which everyone knows is more important than book-learning\u2014they have managed to colonize the entire economy. No one knows for sure how it works, but everyone can see that it does work, and that\u2019s good enough. Get yourself a bachelor\u2019s degree from a \u201cgood school,\u201d and those dreamy dreams of yours can come true. Get something else, like a cosmetologist license or a membership in the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, and you lose.\n\nWe don\u2019t pause to consider that maybe we\u2019ve got the whole thing backwards\u2014that the big universities expanded in their heyday to keep up with industry demand, not to build the middle class. Instead, what everyone agrees on is this: higher education is the industry that sells tickets to the affluent life. In fact, they are the only ones licensed to do this. Yes, there are many colleges one can choose from\u2014public, private, and for-profit\u2014but collectively they control the one credential that we believe to be of value. Everything about them advertises it. The armorial logos, the Gothic towers, even the names of the great colleges, so redolent of money and privilege and aristocracy: Duke and Princeton and Vanderbilt. If you want to succeed, you must go to them; they are the ones controlling the gate.\n\nWhat they sell, in other words, is something we believe to be so valuable it is almost impossible to measure. Anyone in her right mind would pay an enormous price for it.\n\nAnother fact: This same industry, despite its legal status as a public charity, is today driven by motives indistinguishable from the profit-maximizing entities traded on the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nThe coming of \u201cacademic capitalism\u201d has been anticipated and praised for years; today it is here. Colleges and universities clamor greedily these days for pharmaceutical patents and ownership chunks of high-tech startups; they boast of being \u201centrepreneurial\u201d; they have rationalized and outsourced countless aspects of their operations in the search for cash; they fight their workers nearly as ferociously as a nineteenth-century railroad baron; and the richest among them have turned their endowments into in-house hedge funds.\n\nNow, consider the seventeen-year-old customer against whom this predatory institution squares off. He comes loping to the bargaining table armed with about the same amount of guile that, a few years earlier, he brought to Santa\u2019s lap in the happy holiday shopping center. You can be sure that he knows all about the imperative of achieving his dreams, and the status that will surely flow from the beloved institution. Either he goes to college like the rest of his friends, or he goes to work.\n\nHe knows enough about the world to predict the kind of work he\u2019ll get with only a high school diploma in his pocket, but of the ways of the University he knows precious little. He is the opposite of a savvy consumer. And yet here he comes nevertheless, armed with the ability to pay virtually any price his dream school demands that he pay. All he needs to do is sign a student loan application, binding himself forever and inescapably with a financial instrument that he only dimly understands and that, thanks to the optimism of adolescence, he has not yet learned to fear.\n\nThe disaster that the university has proceeded to inflict on the youth of America, I submit, is the direct and inescapable outcome of this grim equation. Yes, in certain reaches of the system the variables are different and the yield isn\u2019t quite as dreadful as in others. But by and large, once all the factors I have described were in place, it was a matter of simple math. Grant to an industry control over access to the good things in life; insist that it transform itself into a throat-cutting, market-minded mercenary; get thought leaders to declare it to be the answer to every problem; mute any reservations the nation might have about it\u2014and, lastly, send it your unsuspecting kids, armed with a blank check drawn on their own futures.\n\nWas it not inevitable? Put these four pieces together, and of course attendance costs will ascend at a head-swimming clip, reaching $60,000 a year now at some private schools. Of course young people will be saddled with life-crushing amounts of debt; of course the university will use its knowledge of them\u2014their list of college choices, their campus visits, their hopes for the future\u2014to extract every last possible dollar from the teenage mark and her family. It is lambs trotting blithely to the slaughter. It is the utterly predictable fruits of our simultaneous love affairs with College and the Market. It is the same lesson taught us by so many other disastrous privatizations: in our passion for entrepreneurship and meritocracy, we forgot that maybe the market wasn\u2019t the solution to all things.\n\nAn Accounting of Sorts\n\nAn educational publisher wrote to me a few months back; they wanted to reprint an essay of mine that they had seen on the Internet, where it is available for free. The textbook in which they wanted to include it, they said, would be \u201cinexpensively priced,\u201d and authors were therefore being asked to keep their reprint fees to a minimum. The low, low price that students were to pay for this textbook: $75.95. \u201cApproximately.\u201d\n\nI was astounded, but it took just a few minutes of research to realize that $76 was, in fact, altruistic by the standards of this industry. Paying $250 for a textbook is more like it nowadays; according to one economist, textbook prices have increased 812 percent over the past thirty-five years, outstripping not only inflation (by a mile) but every other commodity\u2014home prices, health care\u2014that we usually consider to be spiraling out of control.\n\nThe explanation is simple. The textbook publishers use every trick known to the marketing mind to obsolete their products year after year, thus closing off the possibility of second-hand sales. What\u2019s more, textbook publishing is a highly concentrated industry\u2014an oligopoly\u2014which means they can drive prices pretty much as high as they feel like driving them. Meanwhile, the professors who assign the textbooks and who might do something about the problem don\u2019t have to pay for them.\n\nActually, that explanation isn\u2019t simple enough. The truth is that rip-offs like this abound in academia\u2014that virtually every aspect of the higher-ed dream has been colonized by monopolies, cartels, and other unrestrained predators\u2014that the charmingly naive American student is in fact a cash cow, and everyone has got a scheme for slicing off a porterhouse or two.\n\nConsider the standardized testing industry and its shadow, the test-prep industry. One of them is supposedly charitable, the other ebulliently profit-minded, but both of them have raked it in for years by stoking a pointless arms race among the anxious youngsters of the nation, each one fearful lest her dream be cancelled out by someone else\u2019s. The testing companies, each of which holds a monopoly over some aspect of the business, charge students hefty registration fees, pay their executives fantastic salaries, and scheme endlessly to enlarge the empire of the standardized test\u2014persuading more people to take advanced placement exams, for example, and invading grade schools, where \u201cNo Child Left Behind\u201d and the push for a \u201cCommon Core\u201d have opened up vast frontiers for testing.\n\nThe test-prep people, meanwhile, match them step for step, charging students far, far heftier fees to help them beat the standardized tests and endlessly scheming to persuade new demographics\u2014grade schoolers, notably\u2014that they need cram school too. Occasionally, news stories appear announcing that test-prep of this kind has little effect on SAT scores, but it\u2019s really the news stories themselves that have little effect. What parent is going to be stingy when their child\u2019s future appears to be at stake? And so the test-prep industry has boomed extravagantly for decades now; there are numerous entrants in the field, and the best established of them, Kaplan Inc., has branched out around the globe and into all manner of educational provinces. Although technically owned by the Washington Post Company, its revenues have dwarfed those of the newspaper for many years.\n\nAnd we\u2019re not even going to start with the test-fraud industry, which is apparently booming as well, as cases of mass cheating surface at Harvard, at prestigious Stuyvesant High, at the benchmark-crazy Atlanta Public Schools, and in South Korea, where SATs for the entire country had to be cancelled a few months back.\n\nConsider the \u201cenrollment management\u201d industry, which helps colleges and universities acquire the student body they desire. Since what this means in many cases is students who can pay\u2014the opposite of the \u201cinclusiveness\u201d most universities say they treasure\u2014enrollment management is a job best left to quiet consultancies, who use the various tools of marketing to discover a student\u2019s \u201cprice sensitivity.\u201d In other words, if you give a discount of a certain amount to a student with a certain SAT score, will that be enough to persuade them to pick up the rest of the tab and attend your school? What will it take to lure them to their second choice? Their third? Enrollment management consultants know the answer, just as they know what kind of discounts to offer in order to maximize the institution\u2019s revenue and boost its all-important test scores.\n\nConsider the sweetheart deals that are so commonplace between university administrations and the businessmen who happen to sit on the university\u2019s board of directors. Consider universities\u2019 real estate operations, which are often thuggish and nearly always tax-free. Consider their army of Washington lobbyists, angling for earmarks and fighting accountability measures. Consider their massive investments in sports. Or their sleazy arrangements with tobacco companies and Big Pharma and high-tech start-ups.\n\nAnd lastly, consider the many universities that have raised their tuition to extravagant levels for no reason at all except to take advantage of the quaint American folk belief that price tags indicate quality. From this faith in price correctness the nation apparently cannot be moved\u2014there is simply no amount of exposure or reporting that will do it\u2014and so the university inevitably becomes a luxury good, like a big Armani label you get to wear through life that costs a fortune but that holds no intrinsic worth at all. \u201cIt serves as a trophy, a symbol,\u201d the former president of George Washington University told Washington Monthly magazine in 2010, describing his own (successful) strategy for making GWU into a top-tier school via gigantic tuition hikes. \u201cIt\u2019s a sort of token of who they think they are.\u201d\n\nIt is all so wonderfully circular, is it not? We know college degrees make us affluent because affluent people have college degrees; and we also know that we must spend lots of money on college\u2014signing up for a life of debt, essentially\u2014because we believe status signifiers like college ought to be fantastically expensive. Think about it this way for long enough and you start to suspect that maybe those fancy stickers you put in your rear window are what education is all about, the distilled essence of the whole thing.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Higher ed is sold as the key to an affluent life.
