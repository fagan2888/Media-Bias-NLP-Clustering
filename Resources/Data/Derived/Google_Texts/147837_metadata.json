But is it actually true? Here are some reasons to suggest that President Obama\u2019s selfless \u2018love\u2019 for Britain may not wholly be sincere.\n\n1. He has never forgiven the British for \u2013 allegedly \u2013 torturing his Kenyan grandfather\n\nObama\u2019s grandfather Hussein Onyango Obama was rounded up in 1949 in the very early days of the rebellion and spent two years in a high security prison.\n\nOnce a cook for a British officer, his family claim Mr Obama was horrifically tortured, whipped every morning and evening until he confessed.\n\nHis third wife Sarah Onyango said white jailers would squeeze his testicles with parallel metallic rods and pierce his nails and buttocks with pins.\n\nMr Obama, whose involvement with the rebellion has never been clear, was left permanently scarred and bitterly anti-British.\n\n2. He rejected the White House bust of Winston Churchill (who was Prime Minister at the time of the Mau Mau uprising in Kenya. See 1.)\n\nThe bronze by Sir Jacob Epstein, worth hundreds of thousands of pounds if it were ever sold on the open market, enjoyed pride of place in the Oval Office during President Bush\u2019s tenure.\n\nBut when British officials offered to let Mr Obama to hang onto the bust for a further four years, the White House said: \u201cThanks, but no thanks.\u201d 3. He snubbed British Prime Minister Gordon Brown True, Brown is eminently snubbable. But that surely wasn\u2019t the real reason that in 2009 Obama refused five times to give the British prime minister a private meeting and then, added insult to injury by giving him a really crappy going home present: a box of DVDs which wouldn\u2019t even play on a UK machine. Brown\u2019s people, on the other hand, had taken care to come up with a thoughtful and generous gift: a pen holder made from the timbers of the Royal Navy anti-slave ship HMS Gannet. 4. He dissed the Queen Full charge sheet here, courtesy of John Nolte. It includes: bungling a toast to Her Majesty; allowing his wife to commit the ultimate l\u00e8se majest\u00e9 by giving her a hug; then he gave her an iPod loaded with photos and videos of himself. 5. He let it be known that he prefers Britain\u2019s oldest enemy the French \u201cWe don\u2019t have a stronger friend and stronger ally than Nicolas Sarkozy, and the French people.\u201d 6. His Brokeback-Mountain-style love-in with Prime Minister David Cameron was insincere \u2013 and probably counterproductive So they flipped burgers together; so they ate hot dogs at basketball game; so Obama calls him \u201cbro.\u201d This is coded language for: \u201cAmerica\u2019s the Daddy now, posh boy \u2013 and you\u2019re my bitch.\u201d Also, that hot dog thing: how is that going to help community relations with the Religion of Peace?\n\n7. \u201cBritish Petroleum\u201d.\n\nNo one calls BP that any more. Except when it\u2019s President Obama trying to make a cheap shot political point, in an election year, by resorting to a bit of casual xenophobia. Dictators, mad mullahs, and African despots play this game all the time. But you\u2019d expect better of the President of a nation with which Britain supposedly has a \u201cSpecial Relationship.\u201d\n\n8. The Falklands\n\nIn the great days of Reagan and Thatcher when maybe there was a Special Relationship, it was with America\u2019s tacit assistance that Britain \u2013 at the behest of the islanders \u2013 wrested the Falkland Islands back from the Argentine invaders. Much blood and treasure was expended in this exercise; it is part of Britain\u2019s national myth. So how disappointing that in a more recent round of Argentine sabre-rattling in 2010, the US should more or less have sided with Britain\u2019s old enemy.\n\n9. Syria\n\nObama and Cameron blame one another for their mutual failure to take effective action in 2013. (Even though, judging by the Libyan debacle, the kind of action they wanted would probably only have made things worse). The White House view is that Cameron bungled the parliamentary vote which led to his bombing plans being vetoed: this resulted in Obama having to abandon his plans too. However, the British countered that the Americans had rushed them into it and that that\u2019s why the vote was lost. Whatever, it all ended up with a big mutual sulk.\n\n10. Libya\n\nProbably Obama\u2019s only intelligent foreign policy decision in his entire presidency was to let his \u201cbro\u201d David Cameron lead the Libyan operation \u2013 with the result that, notwithstanding Benghazi, he could blame someone else when it inevitably went tits up. This Obama duly did in the infamous Atlantic interview.\n\nMr Obama said that the intervention \u201caverted large-scale civilian casualties (and) prevented what almost surely would have been a prolonged and bloody civil conflict\u201d. But he added: \u201cAnd despite all that, Libya is a mess.\u201d\n\nHe left no doubt that he felt blame rested with Europe over the continuing chaos in Libya.\n\n\u201cWhen I go back and I ask myself what went wrong, there\u2019s room for criticism, because I had more faith in the Europeans, given Libya\u2019s proximity, being invested in the follow-up,\u201d said Mr Obama.\n\nMr Cameron became \u201cdistracted by a range of other things\u201d, he said.\n\nPerhaps Obama doesn\u2019t know but someone should have briefed him. Libya is the \u201cspecial place\u201d that Cameron goes back to in his head whenever things are tough at home. He loved that bit where he was greeted by the locals in Benghazi as a liberator. (Though he appears to have edited out the stuff that happened next, like half the country being taken over by Al Qaeda and ISIS; all those refugees; etc)\n\n11. \u201cFree riders aggravate me.\u201d\n\nThat was the other cruel jibe from the Atlantic interview. Obama was accusing Britain \u2013 and therefore Cameron \u2013 of failing to pull its weight with regard to defence spending. This is, of course, quite true. Cameron has spent his period as prime minister mercilessly paring down the UK military. That\u2019s because Cameron prefers spending the money giving unnecessary aid to help failed states buy more jets and palaces, rather than defending the free world.\n\n12. It\u2019s in America\u2019s interest that remains in the EU, not Britain\u2019s\n\nDo you really think that Obama gives a smidgen of a damn about whether or not the EU is really good for Britain? If so then I have the most amazing bridge to sell you. No, the US wants Britain in Europe to try to keep the French and Germans in check \u2013 as has been the plan ever since 1947 when it passed the resolution \u201cCongress favours the creation of a United States of Europe.\u201d Also, being a left-wing fan of bigger government and democratic unaccountability (see his various Czars; his contempt for the Constitution), Obama is naturally sympathetic to the EU\u2019s aims and its ways of doing business.\n\nListen to the discussion of this article on Breitbart News Daily on SiriusXM:", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Obama is flying to Britain to persuade her people that their best interests lie in remaining shackled to the rotting corpse of the European Union.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "President Obama is flying to Britain to persuade her people that their best interests lie in remaining shackled to the rotting corpse of the European Union.", "title": "12 Reasons Why Obama is No 'Friend' of Britain", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/04/GettyImages-461637106.png", "height": 480}, "updated_time": "2016-04-21T06:58:17-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/london/2016/04/16/12-reasons-obama-no-friend-britain/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "President Obama is flying to Britain to persuade her people that their best interests lie in remaining shackled to the rotting corpse of the European Union.", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/04/GettyImages-461637106.png", "title": "12 Reasons Why Obama is No 'Friend' of Britain", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Brexit, Britain, Churchill, David Cameron, EU, Europe, French, friend, Gordon Brown, Kenya, Obama, Queen, special relationship,Breitbart London,obama", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2016-04-16T01:00:14-07:00", "section": "Breitbart London", "modified_time": "2016-04-21T06:58:17-07:00", "tag": "special relationship", "categories": "Breitbart London"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "Except when it\u2019s President Obama trying to make a cheap shot political point, in an election year, by resorting to a bit of casual xenophobia.\nObama was accusing Britain \u2013 and therefore Cameron \u2013 of failing to pull its weight with regard to defence spending.\nHere are some reasons to suggest that President Obama\u2019s selfless \u2018love\u2019 for Britain may not wholly be sincere.\nHe snubbed British Prime Minister Gordon Brown True, Brown is eminently snubbable.\nHe rejected the White House bust of Winston Churchill (who was Prime Minister at the time of the Mau Mau uprising in Kenya."}
