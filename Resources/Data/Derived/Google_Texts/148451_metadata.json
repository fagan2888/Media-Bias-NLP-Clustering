It then looked at the five least-expensive plans after the ACA was enacted. The study\u2019s authors say they adjusted to account for people with pre-existing conditions and other health problems, and then made their comparisons.\n\nBut critics say those numbers are not comparable because the inexpensive pre-Obamacare plans didn\u2019t have to meet the more robust standards that even the cheapest health care plans carry according to the ACA.\n\nAn author of the Manhattan Institute study defended the numbers.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s say tomorrow the government were to say you can only buy cars with a hybrid engine,\u201d Yevgeniy Feyman told New Mexico Watchdog in a telephone interview from New York. \u201cHybrids are much more expensive than traditional vehicles and the cost of cars across the board would increase dramatically \u2026 Now if Congress said, \u2018Well, you can\u2019t call that an increase because you\u2019re getting all these better benefits \u2014 the air is cleaner, it\u2019s safer, etc.\u2019 I\u2019d say, \u2018Yeah, but I still have to pay for it\u2019 \u2026 You\u2019re still making the insurance market more expensive.\u201d\n\nThe Rand Corp. study showed premiums in New Mexico dropping, although one of its co-authors emphasized researchers looked at different statistics than the Manhattan Institute study.\n\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t looking at the changes from 2013 to 2014,\u201d Christine Eibner said in a phone interview from Virginia. Instead, the Rand study tried to simulate what premiums would be like in 2016 with and without the Affordable Care Act, which requires more robust coverage than some bare-bones plans.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re spending more but you\u2019re also getting more,\u201d Eibner said. \u201cWe wanted to control for that.\u201d\n\nUsing that methodology, Rand predicted premiums in places such as New Mexico could fall as the ACA limits the revenue that insurance companies can keep and younger, healthier people sign up.\n\nBut Eibner did not criticize the Manhattan Institute study.\n\n\u201cI looked at it,\u201d she said. \u201cIt looks fine. I don\u2019t see any flaws. You could quibble about using the five lowest priced plans \u2026 For some people who want those (bare-bones) plans and are being forced to buy something more generous, that is an increase for them. But I think our study is looking at a different issue.\u201d\n\nIn New Mexico, those seeking individual health care policies are directed to the troubled healthcare.gov website to enroll for coverage.

Feyman said researchers will update the study when they get those numbers.\n\nContact Rob Nikolewski at rnikolewski@watchdog.org and follow him on Twitter @robnikolewski", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "A study from the Manhattan Institute predicts that individual health care policies may spike 142 percent in NM under Obamacare.", "title": "NM premiums will increase 142 percent under Obamacare, study says - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2013/11/arrow-going-up.jpg", "updated_time": "2013-11-05T13:12:40+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/114586/obamacare-142-nm/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "New Mexico", "tag": "Affordable Care Act,Avik Roy,Forbes.com,Manhattan Institute for Policy Research,New Mexico Watchdog,ObamaCare,Rand Corporation,www.bewellnm.com,www.healthcare.gov,Yevgeniy Feyman", "published_time": "2013-11-05T11:13:43+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-11-05T13:12:40+00:00"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "A study from the Manhattan Institute predicts that individual health care policies may spike 142 percent in NM under Obamacare.", "title": "NM premiums will increase 142 percent under Obamacare, study says - Watchdog.org", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2013/11/arrow-going-up.jpg"}, "creator": "@watchdogorg", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "description": "A study from the Manhattan Institute predicts that individual health care policies may spike 142 percent in NM under Obamacare."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd98ee\"", "article_summary": "Click here for the Manhattan Institute study and here for the Rand Corp. study.\nBy Rob Nikolewski \u2502 New Mexico WatchdogSANTA FE, N.M. \u2013 Individual market premiums in New Mexico will increase 142 percent under the Affordable Care Act, a study by the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research says.\nAn author of the Manhattan Institute study defended the numbers.\nBut Eibner did not criticize the Manhattan Institute study.\nAnother study, by the Rand Corp released in late August, looked at different variables and concluded overall premiums for New Mexico would decrease over time."}
