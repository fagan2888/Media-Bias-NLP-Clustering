Welker was suspended by the NFL this week for four games for violating the league\u2019s performance-enhancement policy. He tested positive for an amphetamine.\n\nAccording to sources on both sides, had the league\u2019s proposal for a new drug policy been ratified by the union, Welker would not have been issued a four-game suspension.\n\nIn return for HGH testing, the league is enticing the union by raising the threshold of marijuana that will trigger a positive test and moving offseason amphetamine or stimulant detection from a violation of the league\u2019s performance-enhancement program \u2014 which has a zero-tolerance policy that issues a four-game suspension to first-time offenders such as Welker \u2014 to a violation in the substance-abuse policy, where a first-time offender would be placed in an NFL program, but not suspended until a second violation.\n\nIf an agreement on the new HGH proposal is reached this weekend, it is still improbable Welker would be able to play Sunday night in the Broncos\u2019 season opener against Indianapolis. However, there is a chance his suspension could be reduced from four games to one or two, according to sources.\n\nWelker is among 29 players over the past three years who would not have been suspended under the league\u2019s new proposal. Welker, an 11-year NFL player who ranks 24th all-time with 841 career catches, tested positive for an amphetamines during the offseason. Multiple sources say Welker tested positive for Adderall, which is commonly used for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. During the season, a positive test for Adderall or other stimulants would fall under the PED policy.\n\nIt might be no coincidence that since Welker\u2019s suspension was announced Tuesday evening, negotiations between the league and union over a new drug policy, and HGH testing, became serious.\n\nOne sticking point in negotiations is that the league wants the power to immediately issue a two-game suspension for players arrested on charges of driving under the influence of alcohol and drugs. The union wants players to have due process before such a penalty is issued.\n\nMike Klis: mklis@denverpost.com or twitter.com/mikeklis", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Wes Welker suspension factors into possible update to NFL drug policy", "title": "Wes Welker suspension factors into possible update to NFL drug policy", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/09/05/wes-welker-suspension-factors-into-possible-update-to-nfl-drug-policy/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140903__wes-welker-broncos-090314bp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140903__wes-welker-broncos-090314bp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-05T17:58:32+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T07:13:34+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The suspension of Broncos receiver Wes Welker has suddenly become a focal point in negotiations between the NFL and players union on a revised drug policy, according to sources on both sides.\nWelker was suspended by the NFL this week for four games for violating the league\u2019s performance-enhancement policy.\nAccording to sources on both sides, had the league\u2019s proposal for a new drug policy been ratified by the union, Welker would not have been issued a four-game suspension.\nIt might be no coincidence that since Welker\u2019s suspension was announced Tuesday evening, negotiations between the league and union over a new drug policy, and HGH testing, became serious.\nWelker, an 11-year NFL player who ranks 24th all-time with 841 career catches, tested positive for an amphetamines during the offseason."}
