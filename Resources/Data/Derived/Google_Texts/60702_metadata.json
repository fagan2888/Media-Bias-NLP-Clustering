In one example, a clinic worker said she was paid a bonus to falsify MRI reports, bolstering the case for surgery. Credit: Praisaeng /Shutterstock.com i\n\nIn many ways, scamming the health system meant to heal California\u2019s injured workers is just too easy.\n\nAnyone can hang out a shingle and purport to be a medical vendor or caregiver by sending a letter to the state \u2013 no proof required. Unscrupulous providers can run up tens of thousands of dollars in bills for meaningless drug tests, salves and medical equipment, knowing that injured workers never will lay eyes on the bill.\n\nRather listen to the story? Subscribe to the Reveal podcast to get this and other stories.\n\nThe gaps in oversight are so tempting that one prosecutor says scammers test-drive ways to fleece the system, often pocketing millions before anyone in a vast market of insurers catches on.\n\n\u201cThey study the weaknesses of the system and exploit it,\u201d said Shaddi Kamiabipour, an Orange County deputy district attorney.\n\nKamiabipour is among the legion of state and federal prosecutors throughout California who maintain that more than $1 billion has been siphoned out of the system.\n\nYet their case documents reveal something else: gaping holes in the state\u2019s strategy to prevent fraud. The architects of other major health programs shored up similar weaknesses long ago. Here is a comparison:\n\nConsolidate the power\n\nWhen Medicare makes rules, it has a strong incentive to encourage doctors, pharmacists and others to follow them: money.\n\nThe purse strings are not held nearly as tightly in California\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation system, in which a division of power creates the first major hurdle.\n\nLawmakers make rules. The state\u2019s Department of Industrial Relations administers workers\u2019 compensation. Judges issue orders in workers\u2019 compensation courts. Medical boards and commissions oversee doctors, pharmacists and chiropractors. And a market of more than 300 insurers and self-insured employers do the day-to-day job of deciding which medical bills to pay and which claims to fight.\n\n\u201cWhen everyone is responsible, no one is,\u201d said Kate Zimmermann, a Kern County prosecutor who has combated workers\u2019 compensation fraud for eight years. \u201cHe who has the gold can write the rules. \u2026 If you have one checkbook, you can say, \u2018If you want the check, this is how.\u2019 \u201d\n\nLeveraging the power to zip the wallet, the federal Affordable Care Act handed a particularly powerful fraud-fighting tool to state Medicaid agencies. They must stop paying a health care provider if they determine there is a \u201ccredible allegation of fraud.\u201d Medical providers then can fight the determination in administrative courts.\n\nNo such rule exists in California\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation program. Yet the facts outlined in one case suggest it could have spared numerous questionable surgeries.\n\nDr. Douglas Mills testified in court that in 2007, he formally complained about a clinic at which he saw an improbable number of MRI reports come back supporting the case for surgery.\n\n\u201cIn my opinion, people were getting hurt, so I wanted to stop it,\u201d Mills said of his experience at San Fernando-based Frontline Medical Associates. Court records show that a state insurance department investigation was underway even before Mills\u2019 report.\n\nFurther testimony confirmed Mills\u2019 suspicions, including a clinic staff member who said she was paid a bonus to falsify MRI reports, bolstering the case for surgery. The revelations came to light last year \u2013 eight years after Mills\u2019 initial complaint \u2013 when 15 people related to the clinic were criminally indicted. The charges in the pending case include aggravated mayhem for surgeries that prosecutors deemed inappropriate.\n\nRoot out sham facilities\n\nMedicare officials know scammers can be brazen enough to steal patient identities, fabricate a sham medical office and bill for phantom care. As a result, the federal program has set up a system to check on medical offices.\n\nMedicare uses its own data to determine whether classes of providers with track records of graft are medium or high risk, such as wheelchair merchants and home health agencies.\n\nBoth types of providers are visited when they initially open, three or five years later \u2013 depending on the industry \u2013 and whenever officials get a complaint. A government-contracted auditor interviews operators and takes a look behind the counter, according to Jason Weinstock, a former supervisory investigator for the U.S. Health and Human Services Department\u2019s inspector general.\n\nIn California\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation system, no such data reviews or facility vetting occur on a regular basis. In fact, no central authority performs inspections to make sure medical firms are doing what they claim to do.\n\nInsurers can steer workers to a network of hand-picked medical providers. But a shadow system operates to the side, in which workers can get medical care from thousands of unregulated providers who seek payment later in workers\u2019 compensation courts.\n\nIn that vacuum of oversight, James Allen Wilson saw a golden opportunity.\n\nWilson worked in the billing department at a hospital, where he had access to the personal information of workers\u2019 compensation patients. Using their information, he set up a fake lab, billed for bogus services and started collecting $354,000 in checks at a post office box.\n\nHe got caught, according to news reports, when a savvy claims adjuster noted that he billed to perform tests on a dead man.\n\nWilson pleaded guilty to identity theft, grand theft and insurance fraud in 2009. In the years since, no checks of workers\u2019 compensation medical providers have been instituted.\n\nEmpower workers to identify bogus bills\n\nAlbert MacKenzie, a former Los Angeles County prosecutor familiar with the Wilson case, said the oversight gaps are compounded by the fact that workers don\u2019t have a way to flag bogus care. Unlike in Medicare or employer-paid health care, injured-worker patients aren\u2019t mailed an explanation of benefits, or a summary of the services and charges related to their health care.\n\n\u201cWhen you have a system that doesn\u2019t even send a patient a copy of what\u2019s being billed for, it\u2019s just Dodge City; open season for fraud,\u201d MacKenzie said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a massive cesspool.\u201d\n\nKim Reeder, a worker who requested her medical records and discovered bills for transportation and language-interpreting services she never used, said mailing such information to workers would be beneficial.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to see all workers have their billing,\u201d said Reeder, of Sherman Oaks. \u201cIf that happens, all this can go away. I just think California is made of significantly more honest people than dishonest people.\u201d\n\nState labor officials say they\u2019ve tried to clamp down on the unregulated care through legislation that gives insurers the power to deny payment for unapproved health treatments. Despite the law, though, such bills for unapproved care remain commonplace in the state\u2019s small workers\u2019 compensation courts.\n\nBan providers convicted of fraud\n\nIn Medicare, medical professionals may be banned from seeking money to see patients if they\u2019ve been convicted of defrauding a health care program or fraud-related offenses.\n\nBut those banned providers have no problem starting a second career in California\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation system.\n\nMedicare banned Dr. Thomas Heric in 2006 after he pleaded guilty to charges related to writing reports based on diagnostic tests that turned out to be fraudulent. In his letter to the judge who sentenced him, Heric pledged that going forward, he would use \u201cwhatever talents I may have in service to the community.\u201d\n\nHeric then found a new line of work in the workers\u2019 compensation medical system. His job was to review data on injured workers\u2019 sleep patterns and issue reports needed to bill insurers.\n\nFive years later, prosecutors accused Heric of fraud again. They say he was writing virtually identical reports that gave rise to sham billing. One expert testified in court that Heric\u2019s sleep-study reports were so bad that they failed to address one worker\u2019s serious breathing problems for months, a lapse that he said could harm \u201cthe general public.\u201d\n\nThat case is pending in Orange County Superior Court. Heric\u2019s attorney, Robert Moest, said Heric stands by the reports and is fighting the charges.\n\n\u201cThere are different opinions in the scientific community,\u201d Moest said. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be the matter of a criminal charge.\u201d\n\nA Reveal analysis of public records found that several other chiropractors and doctors banned by Medicare moved their career to workers\u2019 compensation.\n\nAmong them: chiropractor David C. Nguyen. Medicare banned him in 2005 over an insurance fraud conviction. Earlier this year, San Diego prosecutors indicted him for insurance fraud again, this time for passing along bribes from a chiropractor to a therapy center \u2013 both workers\u2019 compensation medical providers.\n\nLook at who\u2019s running the place\n\nMedicare doesn\u2019t bar just doctors, pharmacists and chiropractors with histories of fraud. It also takes a look at who\u2019s in charge.\n\nOfficials with the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 inspector general\u2019s office will investigate clinic operators\u2019 ownership and ban those with a 5 percent or greater stake who have a history of certain fraud convictions, according to Jason Weinstock. The rule covers direct and indirect ownership.\n\nNo such rule exists in workers\u2019 comp. State labor department officials said they do not have the authority to review the practices of medical professionals.\n\nInstead, they said in a statement, the boards that issue licenses to medical providers are the \u201cappropriate authority for regulation and review.\u201d Yet no board or commission checks who\u2019s running workers\u2019 compensation clinics.\n\nThe state\u2019s chiropractic board stripped Fred Khalili of his license and denied his attempt to get it back in 2013. But he still signs physicians\u2019 paychecks at two Los Angeles County workers\u2019 compensation clinics.\n\nKhalili\u2019s legal problems started in 1995, when an FBI agent informed him that he was under investigation for paying $135,000 in kickbacks to auto-injury lawyers. Khalili was seeing a steady flow of patients who\u2019d been hurt in car crashes, court records say.\n\nFacing an indictment, he began to work undercover for the FBI. He recorded phone conversations with lawyers who demanded a cut of his medical treatment income in exchange for a parade of patients. He even went to the office of one lawyer who was believed to be a member of a Russian gang and kept a gun in his desk drawer, according to court records.\n\nKhalili ultimately pleaded guilty to wire fraud and tax evasion and lost his chiropractic license in 2000. Twelve years later, he returned to the chiropractic board, hoping to get his license reinstated. The board refused, citing subsequent arrests for vandalism, a hit-and-run collision, driving without a license and making harassing phone calls. He appealed the decision to a higher court but lost.\n\nKhalili remains heavily involved in workers\u2019 compensation clinics, something that would draw scrutiny under Medicare\u2019s rules as a fraud prevention measure. In the vacuum of such oversight in workers\u2019 compensation, prosecutors now are pursuing charges against Khalili.\n\nHe was accused in February of insurance fraud for accepting kickbacks on behalf of First Choice Healthcare Medical Group clinics in Los Angeles and Panorama City. In exchange for the kickbacks, he directed staff at the clinics to dispense expensive pain creams to injured workers, the case alleges.\n\nThe charges against Khalili say he directed an attorney in 2009 to put the clinic ownership in the name of a physician, but Khalili controls the bank accounts. Attorney Malcolm McNeil, who advises First Choice, said Khalili does not own the clinics.\n\nKhalili has not entered a plea in the case, and his criminal attorney did not return calls for comment.\n\nFree the data\n\nLast summer, Medicare released millions of records detailing the services and charges of doctors across the nation. The federal agency billed it as a move \u201cto promote better care, smarter spending, and healthier people.\u201d\n\nThe Medicare data identifies doctors\u2019 billing practices down to the specific test or treatment.\n\nA flood of news stories based on the data followed, identifying high-billing doctors who also were in the crosshairs of law enforcement.\n\nAmong them was a Florida physician accused in a Justice Department lawsuit of performing invasive procedures to clean out seniors\u2019 arteries \u2013 even if they didn\u2019t need it. Another top biller is accused of reaping millions for diagnosing seniors with an eye malady that leads to blindness, whether or not they had the ailment.\n\nNo such transparency effort sheds light on health care spending in California\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation program. Public records in workers\u2019 comp cases are limited to the names of medical providers seeking money in contested court cases.\n\nBarbara Wynn, a Rand Corp. expert who was commissioned by the state to study health spending in its workers\u2019 comp program, has access to the data as a researcher. She said making it available to the public could deter questionable practices: \u201cIt could start fingering potential fraud situations.\u201d\n\nYet the data she has seen is riddled with gaps, she said. She said rules that allow the state to fine insurers that fail to report data are seldom enforced.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to profile what\u2019s happening, you\u2019re only looking at half a deck,\u201d Wynn said. She added that California labor department officials \u201chave sanction authorities, and they need to exercise it. Texas does, Florida does; they really come down on it.\u201d\n\nCalifornia labor officials estimated that about 20 percent of the billing data is missing but said they are writing letters and following up with insurers to encourage them to report all required data.\n\nSimilar data is used in Medicare to identify aberrations and notify doctors when their treatment practices appear unusual. It\u2019s the kind of notice that two California physicians who ended up testifying in a fraud proceeding could have used.\n\nDr. Javier Torres testified that in his 17 years of performing nerve tests on patients, he never did a \u201csingle fiber\u201d nerve test.\n\nThat testimony came in a 2014 fraud case. Orange County prosecutors claim physician Sim Hoffman\u2019s office billed for more than $9 million worth of \u201csingle fiber EMG\u201d tests that it was not even equipped to perform.\n\nDuring the test, a hair-thin needle is dipped into a muscle to detect the nerve jitters that are the hallmark of a disease called myasthenia gravis, which causes weakness and difficulty breathing. It\u2019s believed to be a disease you\u2019re born with \u2013 not something you pick up at work or from doing heavy labor.\n\nThat didn\u2019t stop Hoffman\u2019s office from billing for 18 such procedures in Torres\u2019 name, for a total of more than $8,000, according to court testimony. Hoffman has pleaded not guilty to insurance fraud, and his attorney said in a court filing that the charges against him are so vague and voluminous that \u201che has no meaningful way to mount an adequate defense.\u201d\n\nOpening up billing data would be politically difficult, said Frank Neuhauser, a UC Berkeley researcher who\u2019s studied the California workers\u2019 compensation system for 25 years. Some doctors and attorneys for injured workers could see their income fall if excessive care is reined in.\n\nBut for workers who get questionable surgeries or treatments, and for employers who foot the bill, he said, it would be the right thing to do.\n\nSign up for our newsletter Stay up to date with the latest investigations and episodes from Reveal delivered to your inbox.", "article_metadata": {"contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Holes in oversight leave California workers\\u2019 comp vulnerable to fraud\",\"url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.revealnews.org\\/article\\/holes-in-oversight-leave-california-workers-comp-vulnerable-to-fraud\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2016-04-04 05:00:18\",\"mod_date\":\"2016-04-04 08:52:52\",\"type\":\"article\",\"post_id\":26906,\"author_id\":\"36\",\"author_name\":null,\"author_display_name\":\"Christina Jewett\",\"tags\":[\"California\",\"fraud\",\"health care\",\"workers' comp\",\"workers' compensation\"],\"categories\":[],\"image\":\"https:\\/\\/www.revealnews.org\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2016\\/03\\/shutterstock_218446960-e1459785422189.jpg\"}", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "Reveal", "description": "In many ways, scamming the health system meant to heal California\u2019s injured workers is just too easy.
