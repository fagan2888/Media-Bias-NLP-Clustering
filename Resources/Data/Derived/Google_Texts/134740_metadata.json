Francis, who worked for NBC News subsidiary CNBC during the initial ObamaCare debate in Congress, revealed yesterday that her reports about the math not adding up in the ACA resulted in a dressing-down by her bosses, who claimed that her criticisms amounted to \u201cdisrespecting the office of the President.\u201d\n\nKurtz responded by saying that scrutinizing the office of the President is supposed to be their job, even though the networks and the New York Times still haven\u2019t bothered to do it by Day 5 of Gruberama (via Jeff Dunetz):\n\nFrancis brings on another former CNBC reporter, Charlie Gasparino, who tells a couple of stories about having seen thumbs on the scales while working at the network, and at Newsweek:\n\nBut I will say this, and here is one of chilling aspects working in the mainstream media. Two points. When I was at \u201cNewsweek\u201d when it looked like the exit polls were in and George W. Bush was going to lose to John Kerry, people were doing high fives in the newsroom. I\u2019ll tell you that, that\u2019s one.\n\nThe second thing is, there was a thing, at CNBC, right after the elections when President Obama first took office, the markets were getting crushed. The markets were scared about Obamanomics and his ability to lead. Tim Geithner didn\u2019t lend a lot of courage and confidence in the markets. And we as a network started talking about that. No sooner did we talk about that, than Jeff Immelt the head of GE, which owned CNBC at time called a meeting of senior people, including mostly anchors. Didn\u2019t call me, thank God. And they basically had a talk, a discussion about whether CNBC was being fair to the president.\n\nWe should point out that GE got a lot of largess, received a lot of largess from the Obama administration over the years. Now did they tell you during this, did they tell the people during this meeting, go easy on Obama? No. But you know there is a chilling effect when your boss calls you in, says, not just your boss, the head of GE, everybody is sitting around and you\u2019re saying, oh, are we being fair to the president by pointing out that his economic theories make no sense or whatever we were doing? And you know that is the mainstream media. You know people attack Fox all the time and we give the other side all the time?\n\nNews orgs love to talk about the \u201cfirewall\u201d between ownership and editorial content, and between editorial content and news reporting. That\u2019s not so much the issue in the Newsweek anecdote, but it\u2019s certainly the case in Gasparino\u2019s recollection of CNBC. This wasn\u2019t the head of CNBC or of NBC News making an intervention, but of General Electric pressuring the news staff on editorial direction. That\u2019s not just an example of media bias, but of crony corporatism at work.\n\nAlso, it\u2019s rather amusing that the reporters at Newsweek didn\u2019t understand what exit polls actually mean or how they work, but that\u2019s a topic for a different day.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "\u201cDisrespecting the office of the President\u201d?", "title": "Former CNBC reporter: Network silenced me when I criticized ObamaCare", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2014/11/15/former-cnbc-reporter-network-silenced-me-when-i-criticized-obamacare/", "image": {"secure_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/Wzvi3hK51Lo/0.jpg", "identifier": "http://img.youtube.com/vi/Wzvi3hK51Lo/0.jpg"}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@EdMorrissey"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-11-15T18:01:34+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-15T17:45:02+00:00"}, "keywords": "CNBC, crony capitalism, General Electric, media bias, NBC, ObamaCare,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "article_summary": "The second thing is, there was a thing, at CNBC, right after the elections when President Obama first took office, the markets were getting crushed.\nThat\u2019s not so much the issue in the Newsweek anecdote, but it\u2019s certainly the case in Gasparino\u2019s recollection of CNBC.\nNow did they tell you during this, did they tell the people during this meeting, go easy on Obama?\nAnd they basically had a talk, a discussion about whether CNBC was being fair to the president.\nNews orgs love to talk about the \u201cfirewall\u201d between ownership and editorial content, and between editorial content and news reporting."}
