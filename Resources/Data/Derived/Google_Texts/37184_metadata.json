That\u2019s better than a high-five, which still passes along less than half the amount as a handshake.\n\nSo fist bumps \u2014 popularized by Barack Obama and others \u2014 seem to be the wisest greeting, especially during cold and flu season, said researcher David Whitworth of Aberystwyth University in Wales.\n\nThe importance of hand hygiene is nothing new in medicine. But the researchers realized that while a lot of research focused on hands getting germy from touching doorknobs and other surfaces, only a few studies had looked at handshakes.\n\n\u201cAnd there are alternatives to handshakes. You see them on telly all the time \u2014 the fist bump and high-five and all that,\u201d Whitworth said.\n\nHe and a student, Sara Mela, shook hands, fist-bumped and high-fived each other dozens of times for the research. One wore a glove covered in bacteria, while the other had a clean sterilized glove. After each greeting, they measured how much bacteria had been transferred.\n\nTheir results were published online Monday in the American Journal of Infection Control.\n\nWhat makes the fist bump more sanitary? Mostly, it\u2019s the smaller amount of surface area in contact between the two hands, an analysis suggests. The researchers did practice runs with paint to measure how much surface area each form of greeting involved.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a novel study,\u201d though the results are not surprising, said Mary Lou Manning, president-elect of the Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology. Her organization publishes the journal.\n\nShe said she hasn\u2019t seen much fist-bumping or high-fiving in hospitals. Handshakes are more common\u2014 but they must be followed by good hand-washing, she added.\n\nWhitworth said he hopes the norm changes. \u201cIn a hospital, you really don\u2019t want people to shake hands. It\u2019s an unnecessary risk,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"parsely-link": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/life/health/fist-bumps-less-germy-handshakes-study-says", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "MIKE STOBBE ASSOCIATED PRESS", "parsely-title": "Fist bumps less germy than handshakes, study says", "parsely-image-url": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_456254933.jpg", "twitter": {"description": "When it comes to preventing the spread of germs, maybe the president is on to something with his fondness for fist bumps.", "creator": {"identifier": "@reviewjournal", "id": 15358759}, "url": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/life/health/fist-bumps-less-germy-handshakes-study-says", "image": {"src": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_456254933.jpg"}, "title": "Fist bumps less germy than handshakes, study says", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-pub-date": "2014-07-27T18:53:50Z", "vf": {"unique_id": "reviewjournal-nid-1902756"}, "al": {"web": {"should_fallback": "true"}, "android": {"url": "review-journal://?eid=1695323", "app_name": "review-journal", "package": "com.LVRJ"}, "ios": {"url": "review-journal://?eid=1695323", "app_store_id": 540820524, "app_name": "review-journal"}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=540820524", "fb": {"admins": 630759385, "app_id": 195491203833571}, "google-play-app": "app-id=com.LVRJ", "parsely-author": "MIKE STOBBE ASSOCIATED PRESS", "parsely-section": "Health", "keywords": "Health,Life,", "parsely-type": "post", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-27T11:53:50-07:00"}, "parsely-tags": "Health,Life", "og": {"site_name": "Las Vegas Review-Journal", "description": "When it comes to preventing the spread of germs, maybe the president is on to something with his fondness for fist bumps.", "title": "Fist bumps less germy than handshakes, study says", "url": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/life/health/fist-bumps-less-germy-handshakes-study-says", "image": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_456254933.jpg", "type": "article"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=0.9", "description": "When it comes to preventing the spread of germs, maybe the president is on to something with his fondness for fist bumps."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdef3d\"", "article_summary": "NEW YORK \u2014 When it comes to preventing the spread of germs, maybe the president is on to something with his fondness for fist bumps.\nBut the researchers realized that while a lot of research focused on hands getting germy from touching doorknobs and other surfaces, only a few studies had looked at handshakes.\nSo fist bumps \u2014 popularized by Barack Obama and others \u2014 seem to be the wisest greeting, especially during cold and flu season, said researcher David Whitworth of Aberystwyth University in Wales.\nYou see them on telly all the time \u2014 the fist bump and high-five and all that,\u201d Whitworth said.\nThe familiar knocking of knuckles spreads only one-twentieth the amount of bacteria that a handshake does, researchers report."}
