Cleveland Clinic this week said it plans to invest $320 million into its Florida healthcare business as the well-respected hospital operator digs deeper into the market.

According to Cleveland Clinic, the money will be spent on capital improvements for its hospital in Weston, Florida, and to launch a new ambulatory center and clinic in Coral Springs.

The Weston hospital will get three new operating rooms and add several inpatient beds. The emergency department will also be expanded, as will the hospital's imaging department and laboratory.

In Coral Springs, Cleveland Clinic will build a 65,000-square-foot facility to house a clinic with 40 exam rooms and an ambulatory surgical wing that will feature several operating rooms.

"These capital improvements support our ability to serve the growing number of patients who seek highly specialized services," said Wael Barsoum, president of Cleveland Clinic Florida, in a statement.

Once the Coral Springs center opens, Cleveland Clinic will run eight facilities in Florida, including its main Weston hospital.

Cleveland Clinic Hospital in Weston earned four stars in the latest Hospital Compare ratings from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.
