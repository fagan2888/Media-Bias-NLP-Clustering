California lost an estimated 42,788 jobs due to Obamacare, the report estimated.\n\nAnd those wage and job-level effects have come before the implementation of Obamacare's employer mandate, which beginning in 2016 will compel firms with 50 to 99 full-time workers to offer them health coverage or pay a fine.\n\n\"We find evidence that the labor force is absorbing these detrimental costs even before the government has started enforcing the most stringent ACA regulations,\" the report said. \"These costs are likely a result of businesses preparing for the employer mandate, providing health insurance to workers and losing access to low-cost coverage.\"\n\nRead MoreSlowdown for Gilead? Analysts say no\n\n\n\n\"Obviously, these are huge numbers,\" lead author Sam Batkins said about the findings.\n\nAnd because of the employer mandate coming down the road, \"we expect the trends to worsen,\" Batkins added.\n\nBatkins said the research detected a marked response at small businesses to insurance premium prices after the implementation of the ACA in 2010, in contrast to how those employers responded to price hikes before the law was adopted. Specifically, there was a correlation between small businesses' cutting jobs and workers' take-home pay being reduced when premiums went up after the ACA took effect, as opposed to before.\n\nRead MoreObamacare 'silver' lining: Prices of plans to drop\n\n\n\n\"While there was no significant relationship between health-care premiums and employment before the ACA, since 2010 small businesses have slowly started shedding jobs and reducing wages,\" the report said.\n\nBatkins said, \"The data sort of points to the law itself. ... Post-ACA, the trends are pretty stark in terms of reduced employment and reduced take-home pay.\"\n\nFor instance, for every 1 percent increase in total premiums paid for insurance for workers at firms employing 50 to 99 people, there was a 0.109 decrease in average weekly pay since the ACA, the report said. Before the ACA was passed, \"we do not identify any statistically significant relationships\" between wages and health premiums, the report said.\n\n\"Although the estimates might appear small, when one considers how premiums have changed since the ACA, the costs are profound,\" the report said. \"Pre-ACA, total premiums in the average state cost $4,653 in 2009 and grew by 19.8 percent to $5,576 by 2013.\"\n\nRead MoreAppeals court voids Obamacare aid case\n\n\n\n\"So a 19.8 percent increase in total premiums is associated with a 2.2 percent decrease in average weekly pay,\" the report said.", "article_metadata": {"AssetType": "cnbcnewsstory", "description": "Obamacare's cost for small businesses are anything but small, with $22.6 billion in reduced pay and 350,000 fewer jobs, a new analysis finds.", "author": "Dan Mangan", "og": {"site_name": "CNBC", "description": "Obamacare's cost for small businesses are anything but small, with $22.6 billion in reduced pay and 350,000 fewer jobs, a new analysis finds.", "title": "Obamacare small-biz toll: $23 billion, 350K jobs", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2014/09/09/bill-for-small-business-big-bucks-fewer-jobs.html", "image": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2014/09/08/101981411-183711185.1910x1000.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Obamacare's cost for small businesses are anything but small, with $22.6 billion in reduced pay and 350,000 fewer jobs, a new analysis finds.", "title": "Obamacare's bill for small businesses?
