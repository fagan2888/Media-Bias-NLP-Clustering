Specifically, the college paid ARCADIS\u2019 water division, Malcolm Pirnie, which was a separate company until ARCADIS acquired it in 2009, according to Borgerding.\n\nThe school paid ARCADIS hourly rates ranging from $133 to $290 an hour at one point, \u201csignificantly higher than benchmark firms performing similar work at NVCC,\u201d the audit said.\n\nNVCC didn\u2019t assign an administrator to review contracts, and invoices were approved for payment without any review as to whether the firm had performed the work.\n\nOn top of that, Arcadis was supposed to submit weekly reports summarizing activity for the week, but didn\u2019t \u2014 for at least two years.\n\nThe full report is online here.\n\nRead more at Watchdog.org\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "At least one of Virginia\u2019s 23 community colleges has some serious shaping up to do, a recent state audit revealed.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "At least one of Virginia\u2019s 23 community colleges has some serious shaping up to do, a recent state audit revealed.", "title": "Northern Va.
