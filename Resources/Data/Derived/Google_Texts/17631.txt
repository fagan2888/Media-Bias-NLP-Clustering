Republicans and Democrats on the House Ways and Means health subcommittee today made the most of a chance to pin the recent wave of CO-OP carrier failures on each other.

Rep. Kevin Brady, R-Texas, chairman of the subcommittee, organized the hearing to take a look at the poor performance of the Consumer Operated and Oriented Plan (CO-OP) health insurers, a group of companies started with a loan pool created by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (PPACA).
