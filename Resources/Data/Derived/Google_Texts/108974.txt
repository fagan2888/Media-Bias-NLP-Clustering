In New York, an 18 month old baby died after an ear infection and now the parents have been charged with involuntary manslaughter and endangering the welfare of children.The parents should be charged with something more serious because the death was entirely preventable; all it took was some medicine and not being an alternative medicine disciple.Rather than using medicine, the parents embraced homeopathy, which everyone since the 1700s has known is nothing but a placebo. The parents cited financial costs as to why they didn't get real treatment and their child died from streptococcus pneumonia meningitis and a resulting cerebral abscess and edema, but we are in a post-Obamacare world, health care was free for them. Someone with no money does not pay for homeopathy and herbs, since special water is obviously more expensive than regular water.The American Council on Science and Health has the details on this tragedy
