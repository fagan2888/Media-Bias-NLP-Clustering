Maybe not even legal. But then again, maybe not. In fact, after what\u2019s happened so far, anything could happen. The two-party system which the American people have come to love and loathe, all at the same time, is suffering a major migraine. Don McLean should do a reboot of \u201cAmerican Pie,\u201d and make it a song about politics. Most of the lyrics would still fit.\n\nConsider to begin with what\u2019s happened to the Republicans, that Grand Old Party which sprung out of the Whig party, spearheaded by the Pathfinder John Fremont and led to victory by Abraham Lincoln. They began the campaign with a roster that was big enough to be an amateur football team\u201417 all told, which caused something you\u2019ve never seen in the history of American politics. The GOP held a debate on GOP-friendly Fox and fielded a varsity and a junior varsity, although it was difficult to tell which was which. One had Trump, and the other didn\u2019t. One \"debate\" included a woman, and the other didn\u2019t. One had a black candidate; the other didn\u2019t. Both of them wanted to repeal Obamacare.\n\nIf any other candidate had dissed John McCain for being captured, questioned his heroic qualities, talked about Mexican rapists on the border, boasted constantly about how rich he was (\u201creally rich,\u201d it turns out), and insulted one woman reporter and women in general he or she would long ago have dropped out of the race in sheer embarrassment and shame. But Donald Trump is incapable of showing embarrassment, and for sure he has less than zero shame.\n\nThe unwieldy formats and large number of would-be-presidents have made it impossible for anyone else to be heard above the din. Carly Fiorina stood out among the B team, not a difficult thing to do since it included a lineup made up almost entirely of former something-or-others.\n\nOn the other side, Hillary Clinton is now officially in hot water over her emails, because Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) wants to hold a hearing. Tell Issa that it\u2019s raining in Japan, and he\u2019ll want to hold a hearing on it. Clinton, once the dead-certain front-runner\u2014an experience which she\u2019s had experience with\u2014is now seen negatively by a majority of voters, as is Trump. Bernie Sanders is getting big crowds, and people are buzzing about a possible Joe Biden run.\n\nIs this crazy or what?\n\nA few things are certain. People are so unhappy about the status quo: nothing get done, and politicians\u2014many of whom are lawyers\u2014are more distrusted than lawyers. Many people\u2014the economically distressed members of the white, struggling class\u2014are so angry that they\u2019ll swallow Trump\u2019s attempt to present himself as a populist, a man of the people who earned his wealth the \"hard\" way\u2014he inherited it.\n\nAs has been suggested by media and politicians alike, people are really ticked off. They\u2019re not listening to anybody. They want change. They want a wall, walling off Mexico. They wanted ISIS conquered. They want good jobs which they see going overseas. They want . . .\n\n. . . Change, even if it means changing the whole electoral system and letting chaos reign in the 2016 elections. It wouldn\u2019t be the first time that the outsider spirit from a dispirited electorate has had a huge impact on elections. Look at Ross Perot\u2019s two independent runs back in the 1990s which guaranteed two Clinton (Bill) victories. Look at Theodore Roosevelt and his Bull Moose party, derailing Taft\u2019s re-election campaign. Look at the 1860 campaign, derailed by two Democratic candidates, one of whom was from an about-to-secede South, that guaranteed Lincoln\u2019s election.\n\nSo, it\u2019s bye-bye, Miss American party, good old boys drinking whiskey and wry. Don\u2019t bother driving your Chevy to the levee, because American parties have run dry of ideas and political appeal.", "article_metadata": {"google-site-verification": "ugP87rLrMjrBYBz9rCcVsjWtHPbxwO_sPTuJFJaAP8M"}, "article_summary": "So, it\u2019s bye-bye, Miss American party, good old boys drinking whiskey and wry.\nDon\u2019t bother driving your Chevy to the levee, because American parties have run dry of ideas and political appeal.\nThey began the campaign with a roster that was big enough to be an amateur football team\u201417 all told, which caused something you\u2019ve never seen in the history of American politics.\nLook at the 1860 campaign, derailed by two Democratic candidates, one of whom was from an about-to-secede South, that guaranteed Lincoln\u2019s election.\nLook at Theodore Roosevelt and his Bull Moose party, derailing Taft\u2019s re-election campaign."}
