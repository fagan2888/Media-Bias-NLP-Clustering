Today, 65 percent of hospitals contract out that function. And some emergency medicine staffing groups \u2014 many serve a large number of hospitals, either nationally or locally \u2014 opt out of all insurance plans.\n\nAs more insurance plans contract with narrower networks of doctors to form offerings tailored to the Affordable Care Act, insurers have acquired greater leverage in cutting payments to physicians. While an insurer would have little power to drive a hard bargain with a major hospital that the company needs in its network, it can often pick and choose among physicians, excluding some or offering rates so low that many doctors say their practices are unsustainable.\n\nDr. Jeffrey Bettinger, chairman of the reimbursement committee of the American College of Emergency Physicians, said that out-of-network emergency room doctors were an unusual phenomenon and expressed doubt that the practice was widespread. When it occurred, he added, it was typically because of insurers\u2019 unwillingness to pay doctors a reasonable rate compared to what they pay hospitals for their services.\n\nThe average salary of an emergency room physician was $311,000 in 2014, rising from $247,000 since 2010 \u2014 a period when many other types of doctors experienced declines in salaries, according to Merritt Hawkins, a physician staffing firm.\n\nHospital charges for emergency care vary widely. A recent study found that hospital charges for a visit involving a serious medical issue in California varied between $275 and $6,662, just for the facility fee. \u201cMuch of the variation we observe may in fact be entirely random,\u201d wrote the authors, emergency physicians at the University of California San Francisco Medical Center. But that variation often does not directly affect patients, since most hospitals participate in the big insurance plans in their area, and patients tend to know which are in their network, so the insurer covers most of the bill.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut it is a different matter with emergency room doctors who bill out-of-network fees, experts say.\n\nWhen Dr. Michael Schwartz\u2019s daughter went to an emergency room in the Philadelphia suburbs for a reaction to a medication in 2010, she went to an in-network hospital, Bryn Mawr. She was there for a few hours on a cardiac monitor. While most of her care was covered by his family\u2019s insurer, Capital Blue Cross, a bill of more than $2,000 from the out-of-network E.R. physicians for cardiac monitoring was not.\n\n\u201cI tried to negotiate with the physician group, but they wouldn\u2019t budge,\u201d said Dr. Schwartz, a pediatrician, who ended up paying $1,200, the amount his plan required for his share of out-of-network care. \u201cIt was ridiculous. I\u2019m a physician and I understand how this works. There was no sign saying, \u2018Our physicians are out-of-network.\u2019 \u201d\n\nLikewise, when Luke Adami, 6, sustained a gash to his chin on a playground, his parents rushed him to an emergency room at an in-network facility, Valley Hospital in New Jersey. The parents, Greg and Madeleine Adami, asked about a plastic surgeon to sew him up. Mr. Adami recalled: \u201cYou go to a hospital that\u2019s in network, your kid\u2019s bleeding. What are you going to say?\u201d\n\nThe nurse did not mention that the surgeon she called was out of network and would charge a separate fee. Neither did the plastic surgeon say anything about costs when he came in.\n\nHe billed the Adamis $4,878 for eight stitches that were coded as \u201copen wound, jaw, complicated.\u201d \u201cWhen I looked at the bill, I laughed and I told the surgeon\u2019s office, \u2018Process this claim with my insurer. I\u2019m not paying out of pocket,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Adami said. \u201cThe hospital has control over who they bring in. But I do not.\u201d\n\nEmergency physicians say they are not to blame. \u201cIn general, E.R. physicians try to align themselves with whatever networks their hospitals are in, but sometimes the rates pale compared to what is offered to the hospitals,\u201d said Dr. Bettinger of the emergency physicians\u2019 group. That often leads to protracted negotiations, he said, but eventually the insurers and the doctors come to agreement and sign a contract.\n\nIn the meantime, patients are stuck with out-of-pocket charges. Regulations created by the Affordable Care Act specify that insurers must use the best-paying among three methods for reimbursing out-of-network physicians dispensing emergency care: pay the Medicare rate; pay the median in-network amount for the service; or apply the usual formula they use to determine out-of-network reimbursement, which often depends on \u201cusual and customary rates\u201d in the area.\n\nBut in most states, doctors can then bill patients for the difference between their charge and what the insurer paid.\n\nIn months of dickering over her husband\u2019s bill, Ms. Hopper has learned much about health insurance in Texas. Watching her travails, her husband, a lawyer, told her: \u201cIf you were my client, I\u2019d advise you just to pay the $800 and move on with your life.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nShe was too angry to take his advice.\n\nBut if she or her husband ends up in an emergency room again, she knows they will be vulnerable because only a handful of doctors in any of Austin\u2019s emergency rooms participate in insurance plans. She sighed: \u201cEven knowing everything I know now, it\u2019s completely out of your control.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140928203926, "twitter": {"description": "Emergency room physicians are leaving patients with hefty bills: More and more, doctors who work in emergency rooms are private contractors who are out of network or do not accept any insurance plans.", "title": "Costs Can Go Up Fast When E.R.
