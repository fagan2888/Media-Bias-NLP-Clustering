Let\u2019s be perfectly clear: for anyone to support this diabolical intrusion, which by design seizes control of our lives and strips us of the little bit of conscience America has left, is unconscionable.\n\nThe websites for Massachusetts\u2019 Health Connector and Access Health Connecticut, Connecticut\u2019s official health insurance exchange, specifically asks those attempting to sign up for health insurance coverage, if they have any \u201cunborn children.\u201d Is anyone in the household pregnant? Why? \u201cUnborn Children\u201d are counted as members of her household, so with this information, it helps determine whether she is eligible for assistance with health care costs!\n\n\u201cUnborn Children\u201d are members! Wait\u2026! What\u2026? Who\u2026? How\u2026? So, let me get this straight\u2026 this segment of society which you have determined via Roe Vs. Wade to have no rights because they are not a person \u2013 and are not to be considered as a viable human being \u2013 but at the whim of the mother, can be torn and ripped out of the womb and mercilessly killed, and yet you now choose to recognize their \u201cpersonhood and viability\u201d by including them as members of your socialistic, genocidal, health care plan! Oh the unmitigated hypocrisy! This is demonstratively evil. The plan including them in coverage for their health, will also pay for them to be murdered, for their death, if another so chooses. Surely the facade of benevolence has been removed and we see the face of man\u2019s inhumanity to man and another depth of depravity for America. As Dr. Ben Carson, the brilliant renowned neurosurgeon from John Hopkins stated,\n\n\u201c\u2026the Affordable Health Care Plan is not about health care but control. It is the worse thing to happen to America since slavery.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnborn Children are members\u2026\u201d I was so appalled I thought of God\u2019s response to Adam and Eve when He said, \u201cWhat Is This That Thou Hast Done!\u201d As it was for Adam and Eve, so shall it be for this nation: they never got back to the place of their prosperity and neither will America ever get back once this law is fully instituted. Their expulsion from the place of their prosperity set the stage for the murder and the shedding of innocent blood for millennia; so it is for America. The Affordable Health Care Act, by design, will increase the slaughter of the innocent and they will predominately be African-American\u2026 also by design.\n\nThis mockery of justice is an \u201cobamanation.\u201d The themes of this madness mock justice and deceive its hearers, lulling them to sleep, thus ensuring their ignorance. Abortion. We hear terms safe, legal, and rare. Deception. The data proves it\u2019s not safe for women; by omission they censor information on the possible link between abortion and breast cancer, the high probability of miscarriages, and psychological damage similar to PTSD. Legal? It was Augustine who said, \u201c\u2026an unjust law is no law at all\u2026\u201d Slavery was legal. Jim Crow was legal. But because it was legal didn\u2019t make it right. Rare? Deception. Abortion is the most performed operation on a woman. One out of four women will have an abortion. In the African-American community, it can truly be described as Black Genocide, for as I have written before, 52% of all African-American pregnancies end in Abortion \u2013 1,786 a day\u2026 Spelled out, that\u2019s One-Thousand-Seven-Hundred-Eighty-Six African-American children a day! In the City of New York, 60% of African-American pregnancies end with the death of the child by Abortion.\n\nIt\u2019s the same for Obamacare\u2026 Deception. That name implies \u2018Barack-Obama-Cares\u2019 about the Americans who will be receiving its care. It would appear that 2,000 companies and Unions who are a part of the Democrat machine, along with the Congress and their employees, are the only ones he cares about, for they are all exempted \u2013 along with himself \u2013 from having to have \u201cObamacare.\u201d Affordable? Deception. Remember when Candidate Obama was running for president\u2026 you were promised a savings of $2,500 only to find out it will cost nearly three times the amount promised each family would save. How in heaven can you call this affordable? When companies are making full-time employees, part-time employees, and you ask them why, and they say: they can\u2019t \u201cafford\u201d to keep them full time because of the \u201cAffordable\u201d Health Care Act\u2026 What\u2019s wrong with this picture? The irony is unbearable and the sanity of Americans who remain silent, especially those in the church, is absolutely incomprehensible. We are beginning to mirror the conditions Pastor Martin-Niem\u00f6ller poetically described in Germany in the late 30\u2019s. I have re-arranged his historic quote to reflect America today.\n\nFirst they came for a Conservative talk show host,\n\nAnd I didn\u2019t speak out because I wasn\u2019t a Conservative talk show host.\n\nThen they came for the Tea Party,\n\nAnd I didn\u2019t speak out because I wasn\u2019t a member of the Tea Party,\n\nThen they came for the Catholic Bishops,\n\nAnd I didn\u2019t speak out because I wasn\u2019t a Catholic Bishop,\n\nThen they came for me, a Baptist Preacher;\n\nI told them I voted for \u201cchange\u201d and was with Jessie Jackson and Al Sharpton,\n\nAnd a United Methodist.\n\nThey Left Me Alone!\n\nsource:\n\nRev.
