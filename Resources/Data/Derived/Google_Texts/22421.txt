PARIS (AP) — Eight people have been convicted in connection with a spectacular 2008 holdup at a Harry Winston jewelry shop in Paris, in which three cross-dressing gunmen stole about $92 million in loot, a defense lawyer said Saturday.

Lawyer Philippe Stepniewski said sentences ranged from nine months to 15 years in prison — with the heaviest penalty handed to Douadi Yahiaoui, a 50-year-old repeat offender and alleged ringleader of the heist.

In the robbery, the gunmen wore silky wigs, skirts, stockings and high heels, and took less than 20 minutes to steal hundreds of jewelry pieces and watches.

The eight were convicted late Friday on charges including armed robbery in an organized gang, criminal association, and receiving stolen goods in the 2008 heist, and another a year earlier at the same store. In that one, thieves dressed as building painters slipped in through the store’s service entrance. All told, authorities estimated the two heists netted over 100 million euros ($113 million) in luxury watches, necklaces, earrings and other valuables.
