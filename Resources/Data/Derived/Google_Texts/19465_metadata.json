Perhaps a child has a broken bone, or is underfed, or has been left home alone for too long.\n\nBut when caseworkers drive to the child\u2019s home to investigate, they often discover the same root cause. \u201cWhat we\u2019re finding more and more is that the parents are addicted to opiates. And more often than not, it\u2019s heroin,\u201d said Dick, assistant director of child protective services in Clermont County, Ohio.\n\nIn Ohio and other states ravaged by the latest drug epidemic, officials say substance abuse by parents is a major reason for the growing number of children in foster care. In Clermont County, east of Cincinnati, more than half the children placed in foster care this year have parents who are addicted to opiates, Dick said.\n\nThe number of children living in foster care started rising in 2013 after years of decline. Last year, about 415,000 children were living in foster care, according to federal statistics released last week. Fifteen percent of them hadn\u2019t yet passed their second birthday.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear how many child-welfare cases nationwide involve parents abusing drugs or alcohol, said Nancy Young, director of the federally funded National Center on Substance Abuse and Child Welfare.\n\nBut she suspects that most cases do: \u201cThat\u2019s what all the caseworkers and judges are saying.\u201d\n\nAdded Pressure on State Systems\n\nNumbers emerging from the states show how rising heroin use is putting pressure on child-welfare systems.\n\nIn Ohio, 23 percent of child-welfare cases investigated in 2013 involved heroin or cocaine, up from 19 percent in 2010, state records show. Seventy percent of children less than a year old who were placed in foster care that year had parents who were using those drugs, according to the Public Children Services Association of Ohio (PCSAO), a coalition of county child-welfare agencies.\n\nIn neighboring Indiana, Republican Gov. Mike Pence linked the spike in children moving through the child-welfare system\u201418,925 as of July\u2014to drug abuse, especially of heroin, and hired 113 new caseworkers this year to help handle the load.\n\nAnd in Vermont, substance abuse was cited in more than a third of phone calls to the state\u2019s child-protection hotline. Last year, 1,326 Vermont children were in state custody, up 33 percent in one year.\n\n\u201cYoung children are coming into state custody in unprecedented numbers. This is primarily being driven by parental heroin use,\u201d writes Cindy Walcott, Vermont\u2019s deputy commissioner for family services.\n\nSocial workers point out that drug abuse does not always result in child neglect. But parents might be so consumed by addiction that all they think about is getting high.\n\nOfficials in the three states say child-welfare cases that involve drug addiction are particularly challenging because parents have limited time to prove that they\u2019re able to safely care for their children and get them back.\n\nBut kicking a drug habit\u2014particularly when the drug is heroin\u2014can be a lifelong battle.\n\nFederal law requires that a child be reunited with his family or put up for adoption after spending 15 consecutive months in foster care (or any 15 over a 22-month period). \u201cAs soon as the child-protection agency files the case with the court, the clock starts ticking,\u201d said Angela Sausser, executive director of PCSAO.\n\nMany parents can\u2019t recover in time. Relapse is common with opioids and heroin, Sausser said. And that\u2019s assuming parents can start drug treatment. Waiting lists are often long in Ohio and Vermont, particularly for intensive services like clinics where parents can detox with the help of medication.\n\nWhen a parent has to wait three to six months simply to enter a treatment program, that\u2019s critical lost time, Sausser said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Kicking a drug habit\u2014particularly when the drug is heroin\u2014can be a lifelong battle.", "sailthru.expire_date": "2015-10-10 10:14:08 -0400", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "Kicking a drug habit\u2014particularly when the drug is heroin\u2014can be a lifelong battle.", "title": "How Heroin Is Hitting The Foster Care System", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/heroin-foster-care_us_5617c8f7e4b0e66ad4c75faa", "image": "http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/2000_1000/5617ca8214000024003c7db9.jpeg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/2000_1000/5617ca8214000024003c7db9.jpeg", "height": 1000}, "description": "Kicking a drug habit\u2014particularly when the drug is heroin\u2014can be a lifelong battle.", "site": "@HuffPostPol", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "How Heroin Is Hitting The Foster Care System"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-10-09 10:14:08 -0400", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=us_5617c8f7e4b0e66ad4c75faa", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "heroin,opiates,heroin foster care,foster care system,foster care", "article": {"section": "Politics", "tag": "heroin,opiates,heroin foster care,foster care system,foster care", "published_time": "2015-10-09 10:14:08 -0400", "modified_time": "2015-10-09 10:14:08 -0400"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca7dd\"", "article_summary": "Last year, about 415,000 children were living in foster care, according to federal statistics released last week.\nThe number of children living in foster care started rising in 2013 after years of decline.\nIn Clermont County, east of Cincinnati, more than half the children placed in foster care this year have parents who are addicted to opiates, Dick said.\nTimothy Dick\u2019s office receives all kinds of reports of child abuse and neglect.\nIn Ohio and other states ravaged by the latest drug epidemic, officials say substance abuse by parents is a major reason for the growing number of children in foster care."}
