However, recent global crises have allowed for cooperation between the two countries.\n\nA meeting between an American president and the pope is always big news\u2014and always an event that stirs up interest in the political world about how the event might affect \u201cthe Catholic vote.\u201d\n\nThe Catholic vote is in quotation marks there because the phenomenon actually is pretty hard to pin down. Indeed, one can argue that there isn\u2019t really an identifiable Catholic vote, because the millions of Catholics who vote have reliably tracked the national vote at large for decades now.\n\nPope Francis addresses the crowd from his private apartments on March 23 at the Vatican. Agence France-Presse/Getty Images\n\nFirst, a couple of notes about Thursday\u2019s scheduled meeting in the Vatican between Pope Francis and President Barack Obama. As today\u2019s Capital Journal column notes, there will be a tendency to view this meeting as a confab between a more liberal pope who has de-emphasized the church\u2019s conservative stands on social issues, and stressed more Democratic-friendly themes such as income inequality and compassion toward gays.\n\nBut that analysis is a bit simplistic. The pope has changed the tone and emphasis of the Vatican\u2019s approach to its flock, but he has hardly changed church teachings on issues such as abortion and gay marriage, which inevitably still will create tensions.\n\nThe one political fact that is indisputable is that Pope Francis has won widespread popularity on President Obama\u2019s turf, among Americans generally\u2014self-described liberals as well as conservatives\u2013and American Catholics in particular. A Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll released last week showed that 55% of Americans surveyed said they had a positive view of the pope, compared to just 7% with a negative view. Six in 10 Catholics agreed with the statement that \u201cPope Francis has renewed and strengthened my religious faith and commitment to the Catholic Church.\u201d\n\nThe impact of such things on the American political scene is much harder to determine. Every presidential election cycle brings a bout of speculation about how Catholics are reading the election, and whether any tensions or agreements between America\u2019s bishops and policy makers will steer Catholic votes.\n\nBut as the accompanying chart shows, the Catholic vote tends to mirror the national vote, uncannily so. In every election since 1972, when exit polls began giving us a clearer fix on how various demographic groups voted, the winner of the Catholic vote also has won the national vote. (That was even true in 2000, when Democrat Al Gore won the Catholic vote and the popular vote, even as he lost the Electoral College vote to George W. Bush.)\n\nAnd more often than not, the share of the Catholic vote going Democratic or Republican has been within a point or two of the national vote. In fact, in recent elections, the tracking has become especially close. In each of the last two presidential elections, for example, President Obama\u2019s share of the Catholic vote was just one point off of his share of the overall vote.\n\nThe lesson: There are more than 75 million Catholics in the U.S., and they are an important electoral bloc, but they are far from a monolithic one.\n\nMore:\n\nSeib: Don\u2019t Expect a Mind Meld When Obama, Pope Meet", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "There are more than 75 million Catholics in the U.S., and they are an important electoral bloc, but they are far from a monolithic one, writes Gerald F.
