Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina reported that it was experiencing higher volumes of calls and online queries regarding coverage than usual, as well as more visits to its retail stores.\n\nFlorida Blue, another insurer, estimated volume across the board on Tuesday was about 20 percent higher than usual. While its chairman and chief executive, Patrick J. Geraghty, acknowledged that enrolling through the federal Web site was still slow going by midday, he emphasized that people would have six months to enroll. The deadline is mid-December to have coverage begin on Jan. 1, but people can continue to enroll through March. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to judge it through half a day,\u201d he said.\n\nIn Philadelphia, Independence Blue Cross said it signed up its first customer under the federal health care law earlier in the day. \u201cWe don\u2019t feel as if this has started today,\u201d said Daniel J. Hilferty, the insurer\u2019s president and chief executive, which said his company had been educating people at church events, football games and the like for weeks.\n\nMany people are calling to find out more about the new law, said Mr. Hilferty. The most common question in the last 24 hours, he said, was whether it was possible to get a policy even if a person had a pre-existing medical condition, which is one of the fundamental requirements of the law\u2019s sweeping overhaul of health insurance.\n\nOther insurers were less sanguine. \u201cIt\u2019s got off to a kind of rocky start,\u201d Greg Gieseman, the president and chief executive of a small nonprofit plan, Community First Health Plans in San Antonio, said Tuesday morning. People had been trying for more than three hours to use the federal Web site to enroll and to look at information about plans in his state.\n\nWhile some people might know to go directly to the better-known insurers, Mr. Gieseman was not certain they would know to go to the Web sites of some of the smaller plans. \u201cIt may very well be that a lot of folks don\u2019t know who the carriers are,\u201d he said.\n\nIn Maryland, the chief executive of one of the state\u2019s new offerings, Evergreen Health, said he thought people would wait to sign up and would probably need the help of navigators to steer them through the wide array of offerings. Dr. Peter Beilenson, Evergreen\u2019s president and chief executive, likened the start of the state marketplaces to a political campaign but without a single election day.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re really not going to be able to tell the success of the program for six months,\u201d Dr. Beilenson said. \u201cFolks will come to it when they\u2019re ready.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20131001144521, "BN": "affordable-care-act", "DISPLAYDATE": "October 1, 2013", "article": {"section": "U.S.", "tag": "Uncategorized", "published_time": 1380653121, "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/us/index.jsonp", "modified_time": "2013-10-01T20:07:15-04:00"}, "keywords": "Health Insurance and Managed Care,Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010),Blue Cross and Blue Shield Assn,Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Florida,Maryland,North Carolina,Philadelphia (Pa),Texas,Uncategorized", "PT": "Blogs", "author": "Reed Abelson", "SCG": "affordable-care-act", "sourceApp": "blogs", "CLMST": "Reed Abelson", "byl": "Reed Abelson", "twitter": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/news/affordable-care-act/2013/10/01/health-insurers-report-high-volume-of-queries-on-health-care-coverage/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "description": "Major insurers were reporting heavier-than-usual telephone and online queries about health coverage, even as state marketplace Web sites appeared to be clogged with traffic.", "card": "summary", "title": "Health Insurers Report High Volume of Queries on Health Care Coverage"}, "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/affordable-care-act/post", "description": "Major insurers were reporting heavier-than-usual telephone and online queries about health coverage, even as state marketplace Web sites appeared to be clogged with traffic.", "CG": "U.S.", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "October 1, 2013", "org": "Blue Cross and Blue Shield Assn;Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Florida", "geo": "Maryland;North Carolina;Philadelphia (Pa);Texas", "utime": 20131001200715, "PUD": 20131001, "pdate": 20131001, "des": "Health Insurance and Managed Care;Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010)", "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "og": {"site_name": "In Practice", "description": "Major insurers were reporting heavier-than-usual telephone and online queries about health coverage, even as state marketplace Web sites appeared to be clogged with traffic.", "title": "Health Insurers Report High Volume of Queries on Health Care Coverage", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/news/affordable-care-act/2013/10/01/health-insurers-report-high-volume-of-queries-on-health-care-coverage/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs_v3/../../packages/images/nytdesign/2013/national/inPractice/inPractice-75.png", "type": "article"}, "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "Health Insurers Report High Volume of Queries on Health Care Coverage", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "PST": "Blog Post"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0460\"", "article_summary": "In Philadelphia, Independence Blue Cross said it signed up its first customer under the federal health care law earlier in the day.\nDr. Peter Beilenson, Evergreen\u2019s president and chief executive, likened the start of the state marketplaces to a political campaign but without a single election day.\nBlue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina reported that it was experiencing higher volumes of calls and online queries regarding coverage than usual, as well as more visits to its retail stores.\n\u201cIt\u2019s got off to a kind of rocky start,\u201d Greg Gieseman, the president and chief executive of a small nonprofit plan, Community First Health Plans in San Antonio, said Tuesday morning.\nFlorida Blue, another insurer, estimated volume across the board on Tuesday was about 20 percent higher than usual."}
