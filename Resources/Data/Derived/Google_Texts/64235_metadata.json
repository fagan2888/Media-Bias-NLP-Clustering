Al Diaz/Miami Herald\n\nSebastian de la Cruz needed CPR twice before he was safely transported to Miami\u2019s Jackson Memorial Hospital. The baby nephew of Pamela Rauseo, Sebastian, was born prematurely and suffered respiratory problems, officers later said, which provoked Rauseo to leap from her SUV off the Dolphin Expressway and call for help. Sebastian couldn\u2019t breathe and was turning blue.\n\nRauseo\u2019s pleas didn\u2019t go unanswered for long. Among the motorists that heard her cries was veteran Miami Herald photographer, Al Diaz. \u201cI heard screaming,\u201d he told the newspaper, adding that he saw a woman pop out of the car in front of him \u201cscreaming that the baby can\u2019t breathe.\u201d Diaz quickly rushed down the highway, looking for a patrol car he could alert. He found Sweetwater police officer Amauris Bastidas.\n\n\u201cI lifted him up in the air and moved him up and down,\u201d Bastidas said. \u201cHe started breathing and crying.\u201d\n\nBut there was a problem. Sebastian had stopped breathing again. Together with Rauseo and a passing motorist who pulled over to help, 34-year-old Lucila Godoy, Bastidas, and the two women helped restart the baby\u2019s breathing. By then, Miami Fire Rescue had arrived and were able to check Sebastian\u2019s vital signs before rushing him to the hospital, where he is now in stable condition. Diaz, for his part, remarked on the conflict he felt during the intense ordeal. \u201cAs a photojournalist you want to capture these images,\u201d he told the NY Daily News, \u201cbut as a human being you want to get help.\u201d\n\nFive-month-old Sebastian de la Cruz needed to be resuscitated twice, as Good Samaritans and rescue workers fought to keep him alive.
