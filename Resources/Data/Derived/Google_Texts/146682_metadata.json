Here\u2019s a look at some of the main reasons that 2015 has been a giant headache for the biotech giant. But that headache could find some reilef if the U.S. Senate hands them a legislative victory that would keep American consumers in the dark about what\u2019s in their food.\n\nRoundup Probably Causes Cancer\n\nIn March, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), the World Health Organization\u2019s cancer arm, said that the controversial herbicide glyphosate \u2014 the main ingredient in Monsanto\u2019s popular weedkiller Roundup \u2014 is \u201cprobably carcinogenic to humans.\u201d IARC noted, \u201cCase-control studies of occupational exposure in the USA, Canada, and Sweden reported increased risks for non-Hodgkin lymphoma that persisted after adjustment for other pesticides.\u201d Used by home gardeners, public park gardeners and farmers, and applied to more than 150 food and non-food crops, Roundup is the Monsantot\u2019s leading product and the world\u2019s most-produced weedkiller.\n\nIn June, France banned Roundup. French Ecology Minister Segolene Royal said, \u201cFrance must be on the offensive with regards to the banning of pesticides.\u201d She added, \u201cI have asked garden centers to stop putting Monsanto\u2019s Roundup on sale\u201d in self-service aisles. And earlier this month, California issued a notice of intent to list glyphosate as a carcinogen. \u201cAs far as I\u2019m aware, this is the first regulatory agency in the U.S. to determine that glyphosate is a carcinogen,\u201d said Dr. Nathan Donley, a scientist at the Center for Biological Diversity. \u201cSo this is a very big deal.\u201d\n\nBig news! California EPA Moves to Label Monsanto\u2019s Roundup \u2018Carcinogenic\u2019 http://t.co/gbIK0XVkhd #BanRoundup pic.twitter.com/6QZqUw9oxm \u2014 Center 4 Food Safety (@TrueFoodNow) September 6, 2015\n\nIn April, U.S. citizens filed a class action lawsuit against Monsanto, claiming that the company is guilty of false advertising by claiming that glyphosate targets an enzyme only found in plants and not in humans or animals. The plaintiffs argue that the targeted enzyme, EPSP synthase, is found in the microbiota that reside in human and non-human animal intestines. In addition to its potential cancer-causing properties, Roundup has been linked to a host of other health issues, environmental problems and the record decline of monarch butterflies. And in September, another of the company\u2019s herbicides got slammed when a French appeals court confirmed that Monsanto was guilty of chemical poisoning, upholding a 2012 ruling in favor of Paul Francois, whose lawyers claimed the company\u2019s Lasso weedkiller gave the cereal farmer neurological problems, including memory loss and headaches. Tweet Backfires Monsanto would probably love to forget one of their recent tweets that tried to put out the glyphosate-fueled public image fire. A day before the cancer-listing announcement by California\u2019s EPA, Monsanto posted a tweet, asking if people has questions about glyphosate with a link to a FAQ page:\n\nDo you have questions about glyphosate? We\u2019re answering the most common questions here: http://t.co/liwzBzdwCm pic.twitter.com/qLof0WxVfs \u2014 Monsanto Company (@MonsantoCo) September 3, 2015\n\nThe tweet wasn\u2019t the PR success that the company had hoped for. Instead of helping to alleviate consumer fears about the chemical, the tweet became a target for the Monsanto-hating Twitterati:\n\n@MonsantoCo can u drink a glass of some on TV so we can see what happens? U like conducting experiments on us. Try it on your self first. \u2014 Raul Duke (@GoForBronze) September 3, 2015\n\n@MonsantoCo how much exposure do I need to guarantee I get cancer? \u2014 Tom Pratt (@TomDLPratt) September 3, 2015\n\n@MonsantoCo if I drink more than a few glasses, my tummy hurts. Can you help? \u2014 Tom Payne (@areasonablefee) September 3, 2015\n\n@MonsantoCo yes I do have questions about Roundup, like when will you stop killing your fellow man along with soil and water?#MakeItRight \u2014 Lisa Canning (@LisCanning) September 9, 2015\n\n@MonsantoCo new pub: honeybee navigation affected by traces of #glyphosate,negative consequences 4 colony foraging http://t.co/VY8701EHaw \u2026 \u2014 Klaus Riede (@KlausRiede) September 5, 2015\n\nAnyone want 2 ask @MonsantoCo why shoving known carcinogens down ppl throats world-over?

A new European Union law signed in March allows individual member countries to be excluded from any GM cultivation approval request. European opposition to GMOs has been strong: Unlike in the Americas and Asia, where GMO crops are widely grown, only Monsanto\u2019s pest-resistant MON810, a GMO maize, is grown in Europe. Several nations have taken advantage of the new exclusion law: Scotland, Germany, Latvia, Greece, France and recently, Northern Ireland, have all invoked it. In August, Scotland became the first EU nation to ban the growing of genetically modified crops by requesting to be excluded by Monsanto\u2019s application to grow GMO crops across the EU. \u201cScotland is known around the world for our beautiful natural environment \u2014 and banning growing genetically modified crops will protect and further enhance our clean, green status,\u201d said Rural Affairs Secretary Richard Lochhead. Germany cited strong resistance from farmers and the public when it made its opt-out request. \u201cGermany has committed a true act of food democracy by listening to the majority of its citizens that oppose GMO cultivation and support more sustainable, resilient organic food production that doesn\u2019t perpetuate the overuse of toxic herbicides,\u201d said Lisa Archer, food and technology director at environmental nonprofit Friends of the Earth. \u201cWe are hopeful that more members of the EU will follow suit and that the U.S. Congress will protect our basic right to know what we are feeding our families by requiring mandatory GMO labeling.\u201d\n\nSoon after Germany\u2019s decision, Latvia and Greece announced that they too are taking advantage of the EU law. France, too, is using the opt-out law to ensure the country\u2019s GMO ban remains in place.\n\nBreaking: Europe is rejecting Monsanto's GMOs, 2 more countries Greece & Latvia Just Say No! http://t.co/hGzuIQjsDS pic.twitter.com/xqPh9MAY8K \u2014 food_democracy (@food_democracy) September 2, 2015\n\nWhile anti-GMO activists warn of the dangers that genetically modified foods pose to health and the environment, the Big Food industry and many scientists argue that GMOs are safe and can help feed a skyrocketing human population. Monsanto told Reuters: \u201cWe regret that some countries are deviating from a science-based approach to innovation in agriculture and have elected to prohibit the cultivation of a successful GM product on arbitrary political grounds.\u201d There is a significant political dimension as well: Newswire reported that the GMO opt-out law \u201cdirectly confronts U.S. free trade deal supported by EU, under which the Union should open its doors widely for the U.S. GM industry.\u201d It remains to be seen how the opt-out law will play out in the long run.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Carcinogenic herbicides.
