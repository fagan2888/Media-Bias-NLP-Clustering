Mine would\u2019ve been the only good loan they made,\u201d Green said, teasing about the bank\u2019s subsequent oil bust collapse.\n\nOpening their first store in 1972, the couple \u2014 later with the help of their three children \u2014 grew that initial $600 investment into a multimillion-dollar nationwide company.\n\nWith some 650 Hobby Lobby and affiliated stores across 46 states and 28,000 employees, the company last year had more than $3.65 billion in sales.\n\nThe retailer, in keeping with the strong Christian values of the founding family, is well known for closing Sundays, offering a minimum wage of now $15.24 per hour and winning at the U.S. Supreme Court a campaign against the Affordable Care Act\u2019s mandate for employers to provide access to the so-called morning-after pill.\n\n\u201cGod turned us into a successful company with no debt,\u201d Green said. \u201cAnd we want to use it to his glory.\u201d\n\nGreen\u2019s comments came Thursday at Southern Nazarene University\u2019s Peer Networking Learning luncheon at the Jim Thorpe Events Center. For the first time, he spoke alongside sons Mart and Steve Green, who also are executives in the family business.\n\nThe senior Green said he was a preacher\u2019s kid and, for a long time, felt like a second-class Christian compared to his siblings who all went into the ministry.\n\n\u201cThen, I finally realized, I\u2019m called to do what I\u2019m doing,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not so much what your job is, but how you pursue it.\u201d\n\nGreen said his family believes God owns their business and that they\u2019re only stewards. Consequently, they\u2019ve all signed succession documents, he said, that leave all but a small portion of their company to a foundation, he said. Half of their profits already are earmarked for ministry, he said.\n\nMart Green, who at 19 established the Mardel chain of Christian and education supply stores that today number 35 across seven states, urged guests to follow Jesus\u2019 example and become healers.\n\n\u201cJesus taught, preached and healed,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve followed in his example by establishing schools, churches and hospitals.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be the best at what you do to earn the right to be heard,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t buy from someone simply because they\u2019re Christians, but because of their excellence.\u201d\n\nCurriculum challenge\n\nHobby Lobby President Steve Green shared the company\u2019s ongoing efforts to open the Museum of the Bible in Washington, D.C., with three stories respectively dedicated to the history, narrative and impact of the Bible.\n\nHe said the company in the spring of 2012 sponsored a Bible artifacts exhibit at the Vatican.\n\nSteve Green said their efforts also include developing Christian curriculum for public schools. \u201cWe were excited that Mustang Public Schools were going to offer the curriculum as an elective course until we were stopped by a lawsuit,\u201d he said.\n\nBut that effort, he said, drew the attention of a mayor in Israel, who translated the curriculum into Hebrew for 1,400 kids at three schools, he said.\n\nSteve Green believes the family\u2019s greatest challenge will be introducing the curriculum into U.S. schools.\n\n\u201cBut the Bible is our history and our foundation to our government,\u201d he said. \u201cAll men are created equal. Created and equal are biblical concepts, and that ought to be taught and known.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "With some 650 Hobby Lobby and affiliated stores across 46 states and 28,000 employees, the Oklahoma-based company last year had more than $3.65 billion in sales.The retailer, in keeping with the strong Christian values of the founding family, is well known for closing on Sundays, offering a minimum wage of now $15.24 per hour and winning at the U.S. Supreme Court a campaign against the Affordable Care Act\u2019s mandate for employers to provide access to the so-called morning-after pill.", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 NewsOK.com.
