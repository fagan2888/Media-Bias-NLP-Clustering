So that sometime later, if there\u2019s a Hispanic, or a woman or another African American, that won\u2019t seem as exceptional. These things change over time.\u201d\n\nAs he enters his last year in office, Obama said he hopes he has created \u201ca tone for the next president\u201d that is less strident than the political rhetoric on the campaign trail.\n\nHe said he believes history will treat him, and his legacy, more kindly than it might appear while he\u2019s battling with Congress and a host of foreign crises.\n\nObama laughed and talked for almost an hour with his old friends, reminiscing about the days when he was hazed as a freshman senator who would joke that his name was Irish if it would help get votes.\n\nLarry Walsh, hair shock-white against his Ash Wednesday ashes, greeted Obama with a big bear hug and a loud \u201cBarack!\u201d\n\nKirk Dillard, the Republican who might have been governor if not for the flattering things he said about Obama in 2008, shook his hand heartily.\n\nDenny Jacobs, the rural Democrat who proudly mourns the days of \u201cthe backroom deal,\u201d pulled up a wooden chair closest to the president and got right down to business.\n\n\u201cListen,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to figure out a way to get back what we had, people trying to get things done together.\u201d\n\nThe three were well ensconced when Obama showed up in Springfield in 1997 and they welcomed him into their group \u2013 losing money to him in a weekly card game and then earning it back at Panther Creek golf course.\n\nJoin the conversation on Facebook >>\n\nDillard was more of a supper buddy, not part of the card group, but the moderate suburban Republican quickly gravitated to the Harvard-educated lawyer who could draft legislative language with just a pen and yellow legal pad.\n\nHe killed Obama\u2019s healthcare bills with a two-word death knell, \u201csocialized medicine.\u201d\n\nStill, they worked together to pass state campaign finance and death penalty reform, significant measures that earned Obama a reputation for being able to work across party lines.\n\nThese days, Republicans here rarely break lockstep with the GOP governor, Bruce Rauner, and Democrats keep tight ranks with the leadership in the House and Senate.\n\nThe polarization was on full display Wednesday in the State Capitol building, where Obama returned for the first time since 2009 to see the new Lincoln Library.\n\nDuring Obama\u2019s address, Democrats loudly cheered and stood for his policy suggestions. Republicans mostly sat quietly and smiled, State of the Union style, though a few grayer heads nodded at his stories of the old days.\n\nAt the Hoogland Center for the Arts an hour later, Obama hurried through a crowd and got to the small gallery room early.\n\nYou should\u2019ve had the legislature over for beers, Walsh told him. Obamacare was a mistake, a thuggish move that turned everyone against him, said Dillard.\n\nBut Jacobs said he thinks the wall was built before Obama even hung his clothes in the closet at the White House.\n\n\u201cThey were afraid of you for a couple of reasons. Number one, you were black,\u201d said Jacobs, a white man in his 70s.\n\nObama smiled big, and moderated his blunt-talking friend\u2019s suggestion.\n\n\u201cI have no doubt there are people who voted against me because of race \u2026 or didn\u2019t approve of my agenda because of race,\u201d he said. \u201cI also suspect there are a bunch of people who are excited or voted for me because of the notion of the first African American president \u2026 Those things cut both ways.\u201d\n\nJacobs knows what he knows. \u201cThat\u2019s what they were afraid of, Mr. President,\u201d he said.\n\nDillard blames the way Democrats jammed Obamacare through without a single Republican vote.\n\nObama agreed. \u201cMuscle move,\u201d he said, but protested that Republicans made clear they were determined to block his initiatives.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Obama interview: 'Maybe I could have done ... a little better'", "Description": "He had just given an hourlong speech calling for comity in politics, and President Obama craved a few moments with a few friends who remember when he was not a polarizing figure but an effectively bipartisan one \u2013 his poker buddies from his eight years here in the Illinois Senate.
