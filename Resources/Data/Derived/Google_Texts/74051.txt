Many know Vincent van Gogh as a brilliant impressionist painter, whose many works are displayed in museums across the world. Van Gogh has also come to embody the quintessential tortured creative genius — and for infamously cutting off his left ear in a fit of madness in 1888.

A different museum exhibition showcases the anguished creativity of van Gogh in a far more unusual way: Currently a recreation of van Gogh’s left ear is on display at The Center for Art and Media in Karlsruhe, Germany.

Artist Diemut Strebe used cells from the great-great grandson of van Gogh’s brother, Theo, and other DNA to construct a living replica of the ear. The ear was created using a 3D-printer and was grown in Boston’s Brigham and Women’s Hospital. The ear is currently being kept alive inside of a case full of nourishing fluids, according to the Associated Press, and could “theoretically last for years.”

Vincent van Gogh’s descendant, Lieuwe van Gogh, was apparently readily interested in the project, Strebe told the Associated Press. Lieuwe has 1/16 of the same DNA as Vincent, including the Y chromosome passed down through the male line.
