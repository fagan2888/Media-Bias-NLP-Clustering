Approximately one hundred guests, as well as senior Administration officials including Secretaries Kerry, Lew and Moniz, gathered inside the residence where they listened to Biden defend the Iran deal. According to a pool report, the Vice President said he respected people who vote against it as a matter of conscience, but \"we are going to pass this. I know that disappoints some of you, but it's a done deal.\"\u201cWe are absolutely, unequivocally, completely omitted to the security of Israel.\u201d He made mention of upcoming meetings with Israelis that he asked staff if had been announced yet. They seemed to tell him that the announcement hadn\u2019t been made, but went on to refer to conversations he expected to have with Israeli intelligence and security about what they feel like they need.\u201cYou\u2019re the most incredible community I\u2019ve ever dealt with \u2026 You\u2019re the only outfit that looks out not only for every Jew in the nation and the world, but everyone else.\u201d He choked up and paused for a moment as he started talking about Beau Biden\u2019s death. \u201cThe degree of compassion and understanding that so many of you expressed\u2026you guys get it. It\u2019s sort of baked into your DNA. You understand. You understand.\"\u2014both the parents of his on Beau\u2019s wife and the parents of his daughter Ashley\u2019s husband (who are Jewish) as all his \u201cmispacha.\u201d... \"Everybody always talks about this being a nice Catholic family\u2014but I don\u2019t think so,\u201d he said.Mavs' owner Mark Cuban -- who came together with Rep.

Republican Rep. Peter Roskam of Illinois and other House Republicans are now claiming that the 60-day clock never started ticking because Obama never sent Congress the texts of two separate agreements the International Atomic Energy Agency negotiated with Tehran.\"\"All the maneuvering by opponents of the deal apparently did so without an assist from the powerful pro-Israel lobby, AIPAC, which had hundreds of its members arm-twisting lawmakers on Wednesday. An official with the group said its preference was for a straight vote on the disapproval resolution \u2014 something Senate Democrats are trying to block with a filibuster. Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, urged his colleagues in the House to express their concerns about the side agreements by voting to disapprove of the deal.\"\"After a day of disarray in which Speaker John Boehner was again forced into a corner, Republicans settled on a three-pronged strategy. One vote would rebuke Obama for not disclosing the totality of the agreement to Congress; a second would try to prevent him from lifting sanctions on Iran. Then, in a reversal, a third vote would be on a resolution of approval on the pact, designed to highlight majority opposition to the nuclear agreement. The problem with that element is that House Republicans will now be at odds with Senate Republicans, who plan to vote instead on a disapproval resolution.\"\"No Filibustering the Vote on the Iran Deal\"\"Chuck Schumer's Humiliation\"\"At the Brookings Institution in Washington on Wednesday, Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton spoke slowly and oh so deliberately, to invited guests of the think tank, about the various merits and weaknesses of the Iran deal in the context of a broader strategy in the region... A couple of miles away, outside the Capitol, meanwhile, opponents of the deal waved American and Israeli flags and signs that said \u201cJewish lives matter\u201d and \u201cPOTUS in bed with those who behead.\u201d What Clinton sees as a hard-won accomplishment that will keep Iran from getting nuclear weapons, her Republican rivals call a capitulation guaranteed to get Americans and Israelis killed.\"\u2022 Hillary's speech\u2022 \"In a break with Obama, Clinton lays out tougher worldview\"\"The Trump-Cruz-Palin-and-more rally on Capitol Hill on Wednesday looked more like an Obamacare or immigration rally than the usual crowd for a foreign policy issue.\" by Rosie Gray\u2022 \"Trump Fans to Iran Deal Peaceniks: \u2018Shut the F--- Up!\u2019\" by Olivia Nuzzi\u2022 \"At rally against Iran deal, Tea Party finds itself trumped by Trump\" by Ben Jacobs\u2022 Cruz: \"You Cannot Wash Your Hands of That Blood\"\"The problem with Trump for these Republican Jewish activists isn\u2019t necessarily Trump\u2019s positions, to the extent that they exist, on top-line issues for Jewish voters. Republican Jewish elites see Trump as a hawkish supporter of Israel, like nearly all other members of the Republican primary field. Instead, Trump is seen as a threat to the vision of a bigger, more inclusive GOP, which many leading Republican Jews have advocated.\"-- D.C.'s kosher hub -- last night: (at various tables) Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner, Cory Booker's Rabbis -- Rabbi Shmuley Boteach & Rabbi Shmully Hecht, and Noah Pollak.\"Blowing a shofar and reciting chapters from Psalms, some 200 Orthodox Jewish Rabbis gathered on Wednesday in Washington, DC, to rally Congress to vote against the Iran nuclear deal.\"\"We are here because we are standing on the shoulders of giants. 500 of them who came to the steps of the Capitol on October 6, 1943, two days before Yom Kippur eve to plead with President Roosevelt to save Jewish refugees from Hitler's brutal forces. We are here because they were turned away, partly due to the statement of a prominent Jew who told the President that these people are not representative of the Jewish community... They were the leading Orthodox Rabbis of the 1943... We stand on their shoulders today. We are all here to raise our moral objection to the nuclear with Iran. We all pray that Congress will reject this deal.\"NYTimes ad today from \"Senior Jewish leaders on the Iran agreement\" -- including Charles Bronfman, Michael Adler, Stanley Gold.\"The American Jewish Divide Is About Much More Than Iran\"2.
