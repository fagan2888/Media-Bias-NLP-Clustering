This applies the most, perhaps, to children with severe conditions, who may benefit just as much as adults from medical marijuana treatment \u2014 even as concerns about its effects on their developing minds and bodies arise. But a new study shows how marijuana might still be used to treat children (and adults) with untreatable epilepsy, safely and without the drug\u2019s typical effects.\n\nThe study will be presented at the American Academy of Neurology\u2019s annual meeting. It found that a compound in marijuana, called cannabidiol, could reduce the number of seizures people with various severe forms of epilepsy experienced. Cannabidiol differs from other cannabinoids because it doesn\u2019t induce the characteristic high tied to marijuana\u2019s use. At the same time, previous research has suggested it could shrink tumors, relieve chronic pain, and treat people with psychiatric disorders.\n\nFor the study, 213 people varying in age from toddlers to adults (median age 11) took an orally administered liquid form of cannabidiol each day. Many of the patients had Dravet syndrome or Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, both of which can cause intellectual disability and lifelong seizures \u2014 the rest of the patients had one of 10 other types of severe epilepsy.\n\nThe researchers found that after 12 weeks of taking the drug, the 137 people who completed the study experienced a 54 percent drop in the number of seizures. Breaking that down a bit, people with Dravet syndrome experienced a 53 percent drop in the number of convulsive seizures, while those with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome saw a 55 percent reduction in atonic seizures \u2014 these tend to cause a sudden loss in muscle tone.\n\n\u201cSo far, there have been few formal studies on this marijuana extract,\u201d said study author Dr. Orrin Devinsky, from New York University\u2019s Langone Comprehensive Epilepsy Center, in a press release. \u201cThese results are of great interest, especially for the children and their parents who have been searching for an answer to these debilitating seizures.\u201d\n\nIt turns out some parents have already resorted to cannabidiol-rich marijuana to treat their children\u2019s epilepsy. Last November, for example, an 8-year-old Oregonian boy named Forrest began taking cannabis oil-filled capsules after the anti-epileptic drugs he was taking caused serious side effects like aggression and suicidal thoughts \u2014 the oil helped. Other parents have taken the same route, sometimes putting themselves at risk of lawful consequences.\n\nIn January, the American Academy of Pediatrics released a policy statement recommending the Drug Enforcement Administration reclassify marijuana as a schedule II substance due to the possibility it could treat \u201cchildren with life-limiting or severely debilitating conditions and for whom current therapies are inadequate.\u201d\n\nSource: Devinsky O, et al.
