John McCain, Joni Ernst, Cory Gardner, and Dan Sullivan shared their thoughts on what Donald Trump would need to do in order to unite the party around him.\n\nThe four senators appeared on KFYI\u2019s Mike Broomhead Show as part of McCain\u2019s re-election efforts.\n\n\u201cI think there needs to be a great effort on the part of Donald Trump as well as the Republican Party to come together and start talking about what goals they would have in his administration and it has to be a cohesive message,\u201d said Ernst. \u201cWhat do we want to accomplish? How can we counter the past eight years of a horrible, horrible Obama administration where we have overregulation and burdensome rules?\u201d\n\n\u201cOur nation is hungering for leadership and so Donald Trump will have to provide that type of leadership,\u201d added Ernst. \u201cSo there have to be some great discussions out there and we hope all of us can be a part of finding solutions, not being divisive.\u201d\n\nSen. Sullivan added Trump would need to unite the party around conservative principles.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s obligations all around. We certainly want to win, but I think Mr. Trump has the opportunity, but also the obligation to unite the party around our goals,\u201d said Sullivan. \u201cLet me give you three that I think are critical: less government, more freedom, strong national defense. And the critical one, critical one which has been a failure of the Obama administration is to grow this economy.\u201d\n\nSen. Cory Gardner chimed in that Trump needs to show a distinction between himself and Hillary Clinton.\n\n\u201cIf you want to achieve the dream that you\u2019ve been long fighting for, that\u2019s the distinction that he\u2019ll need to show,\u201d said the Colorado senator of Trump.\n\nMcCain chimed in to say Clinton will continue Obamacare, which he called \u201cone of the greatest disasters of modern times.\u201d\n\nEarlier, McCain responded to audio leaked to Politico of him saying he\u2019d be in for the race of his life with Trump on the top of the ticket in a state with a large Hispanic population.\n\n\u201cWhat was I saying was this is the most turbulent time, obviously,\u201d said McCain saying he needed take his re-election fight as serious as past races. \u201cI said look, anybody now with all this turbulence out there is crazy if they take anything for granted.\u201d\n\n\u201cI really think we have to, all of us, who are seeking re-election as Republicans have to really understand that this a tough time, but it\u2019s not so much Trump as the turbulence out there. Look, Bernie Sanders still continues to hang in,\u201d said McCain added he would work as hard as he could to win.", "article_metadata": {"bf": {"buzzid": 4241181, "userid": 227410}, "google-signin-clientid": "895639880237-tcoheof19odpd88p676rjc70v0iqit0o.apps.googleusercontent.com", "description": "\"We certainly want to win, but I think Mr. Trump has the opportunity, but also the obligation to unite the party around our goals,\" Sen....", "copyright": "Copyright 2016 BuzzFeed, Inc.
