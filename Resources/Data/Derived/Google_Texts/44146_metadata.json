The fourth seed has a record of 95-25 against 13th-seeded opponents in the NCAA tournament.\n\nBut, it could happen.\n\nLast year, 14th-seeded Mercer pulled off the extraordinary and toppled third-seeded Duke in the second round of the tournament. In the same round, three 12 seeds beat out fives to advance.\n\n\"We're not just happy to be here,\" Hayford said. \"We want to go do something special. My team in November won at Indiana and snapped the nation's longest nonconference home winning streak at Assembly Hall. We're capable.\n\nEastern Washington (26-8, 14-4 Big Sky Conference) won its conference championship and second trip to the NCAA tournament. The Eagles' only other appearance came in 2004.\n\nGeorgetown (21-10, 12-6 Big East) is a 7.5-point favorite even though the Hoyas average 10 fewer points per game. Georgetown's record in the NCAA tournament is 1-4 since 2009.\n\nThe energy from Hayford's bold declaration, uncommon in today's world of coach-speak, wasn't met with the same enthusiam from the Hoyas.\n\n\"We all know what's at stake,\" Georgetown guard Jabril Trawick said. \"We're all Division I basketball players. We're all playing for something. We don't feed into it that much. We're just happy that we're here. We're just ready to play.\"\n\nThey'll do just that today at 4 p.m., Pacific time.\n\nFollow Matt Wilhalme on Twitter @mattwilhalme", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "No. 13 seed Eastern Washington coach predicts upset of No. 4 Georgetown", "date": "2015-03-19", "Description": "Eastern Washington Coach Jim Hayford has officially put Georgetown on upset alert.
