This means that the disgraceful tax on dementia will continue.\u201d\n\nUnder proposals revealed today, the government has also announced that changes to the means-testing threshold, which would have meant far more families receiving some help with care costs, will be postponed.\n\nCharities said the move highlighted the strain the social care system is under and called for \u201csignificant\u201d investment to bring it back from the brink of collapse.\n\nThe cap on elderly and disabled care was set at more than double the \u00a335,000 recommended by the independent Dilnot Commission in 2011 and does not cover accommodation and living expenses.\n\nMinisters insisted, however, it would \u201cgive everyone peace of mind by protecting them from catastrophic costs\u201d.\n\nUnder the reforms, the limit on assets that stops people being eligible for help towards their costs was due to rise from \u00a323,250 to \u00a3118,000.\n\nPlans to oblige councils to help people who pay their own costs - known as self funders - find residential care are also being delayed.\n\nOfficials said the Government was still fully committed to introducing the cap within this Parliament but wanted to make sure it was workable from day one.\n\nIn a letter to the LGA, social care minister Alistair Burt said: \u201cWe have taken the difficult decision to delay the introduction of the cap on care costs system and that this will now be introduced from April 2020.\n\n\u201cI want to assure you that this is not a decision that has been taken lightly, but one that has followed from consideration of the genuine concerns you have outlined.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Former health minister Norman Lamb has said Tory -u-turn to bring in a cap on care costs is an \u201coutrageous betrayal\u201d of the electorate.", "author": "Annabelle Dickson", "og": {"site_name": "Eastern Daily Press", "image": "http://www.edp24.co.uk:80/polopoly_fs/1.4158147.1437155082!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_630/image.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Former health minister Norman Lamb has said Tory -u-turn to bring in a cap on care costs is an \u201coutrageous betrayal\u201d of the electorate.", "title": "Former health minister says care cap u-turn is an \u201coutrageous betrayal\u201d of the electorate"}, "twitter": {"card": "photo"}, "title": "Former health minister says care cap u-turn is an \u201coutrageous betrayal\u201d of the electorate", "DC.creator": "Annabelle Dickson", "keywords": "Westminster, Jeremy Hunt, Izzi Seccombe, Norman Lamb, Alistair Burt, Local Government Association, Dilnot Commission", "google-site-verification": "J_WUO-ZxHF6TpEnVuiRBwAswCGs0K6uOoqvRX3rqgrI", "DC.subject": "Westminster, Jeremy Hunt, Izzi Seccombe, Norman Lamb, Alistair Burt, Local Government Association, Dilnot Commission", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "DC.title": "Former health minister says care cap u-turn is an \u201coutrageous betrayal\u201d of the electorate"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdee7\"", "article_summary": "Former health minister says care cap u-turn is an \u201coutrageous betrayal\u201d of the electorateNorman Lamb at the Forum.\nPicture: DENISE BRADLEY ArchantFormer health minister Norman Lamb has said Tory -u-turn to bring in a cap on care costs is an \u201coutrageous betrayal\u201d of the electorate.\nCharities said the move highlighted the strain the social care system is under and called for \u201csignificant\u201d investment to bring it back from the brink of collapse.\n\u201cWith an ageing population care costs are only going to go up year on year.\nIn a letter to the LGA, social care minister Alistair Burt said: \u201cWe have taken the difficult decision to delay the introduction of the cap on care costs system and that this will now be introduced from April 2020."}
