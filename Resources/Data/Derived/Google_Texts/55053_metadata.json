The Chicago resident lacks health insurance and has not visited a doctor in three years.\n\n\u201cWhen I get sick, I take home remedies and pray that it\u2019s nothing serious,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cI don\u2019t want to have to make a choice between paying my school bills and paying an enormous hospital bill.\u201d\n\nHealthy Communities Cook County found in a survey of 400 residents that a majority of the uninsured continue to get health care at hospital emergency rooms, which is more expensive than a standard medical office visit. Supporters of the vote hope the proposal will eventually save money as well as help residents gain access to affordable health care.\n\n\u201cWe have made great progress in connecting Cook County residents to coverage and health care access since the Affordable Care Act was passed, but there is still work to be done to increase access to health care for the uninsured,\u201d Commissioner Jesus \u201cChuy\u201d Garcia said in a statement.\n\nThe task force will include commissioners, as well as representatives from grassroots, health care and professional organizations. Members of Healthy Communities Cook County include Communities United, ENLACE Chicago, the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights, Southwest Organizing Project and the National Alliance on Mental Illness Chicago.\n\nCommunities United, formerly known as Albany Park Neighborhood Council, is a Chicago-based grassroots organization that works on social, economic and racial justice issues.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Equal Voice News covers news about America's working families, poverty and policy.
