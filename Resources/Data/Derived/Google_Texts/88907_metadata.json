While such \"professional courtesy\" arrangements are commonplace in private practice, employers that pay a physician's salary don't allow employees to give away company money via free care.\n\nDiscretion gives way to policy and schedules. Hospital employed physicians can't decide on a case-by-case basis when to send a patient's account to collections, for example, but must allow the hospital to do so on its predetermined schedule. Staff raises, too, are only possible at set times and amounts, and vacation times must be approved in advance.\n\nBase salary will diminish over time. LifePoint will guarantee a salary close to what a physician was previously making for three months to a year, but over the next few years that base salary will decrease by about half and the doctor will be expected to earn the rest based on productivity measured by relative value units.\n\nAnother industry concern about hospital employment is that it can lead to conflicts of interest. The nonprofit hospital system Broward Health in Florida, for example, recently agreed to pay $70 million after whistleblowing physician Michael Reilly, M.D., and the U.S. Department of Justice sued the hospital for allegedly paying employed physicians kickbacks of millions of dollars to generate medical revenue through patient referrals.\n\nFifty-four percent of readers \"strongly agree\" and 26 percent \"somewhat agree\" with the whistleblower's position that hospitals should not hire physicians, according to a Medscape poll. Eight percent of respondents said they \"somewhat agree\" with the statement while 12 percent \"strongly disagree.\"\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read the article\n\n- see the poll\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nTo improve hospital-physician relationships, involve docs in decision-making\n\nHospital employment: Are policies needed to protect physicians?\n\n6 principles to integrate leadership between physicians and hospitals\n\nIs physician employment the right move for hospitals?\n\nHospital-owned physician groups far more likely to refer patients to that facility\n\nAre kickbacks inherent to doc hospital employment?", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hospital employment\u00a0isn't for everyone, a reality that leaders from the LifePoint Health hospital chain strive to make clear to physicians before they join the organization.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Hospital employment\u00a0isn't for everyone, a reality that leaders from the LifePoint Health hospital chain strive to make clear to physicians before they join the organization.", "title": "Hospitals: Ensure physicians know what employment really means", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/hospitals-ensure-physicians-know-what-employment-really-means/2015-10-16", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "cost to recruit,hospital employment,hospital-physician relations,HR & Workforce Management,kickback,Legal / Regulatory / Risk Management,LifePoint Health,MGMA15,physician autonomy,Physician Employment", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "HR & Workforce Management,Legal / Regulatory / Risk Management"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8ad0\"", "article_summary": "6 principles to integrate leadership between physicians and hospitalsIs physician employment the right move for hospitals?\nAnother industry concern about hospital employment is that it can lead to conflicts of interest.\nHospital-owned physician groups far more likely to refer patients to that facilityAre kickbacks inherent to doc hospital employment?\nHospital employment isn't for everyone, a reality that leaders from the LifePoint Health hospital chain strive to make clear to physicians before they join the organization.\nWhile such \"professional courtesy\" arrangements are commonplace in private practice, employers that pay a physician's salary don't allow employees to give away company money via free care."}
