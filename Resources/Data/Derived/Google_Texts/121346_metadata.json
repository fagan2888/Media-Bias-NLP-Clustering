Among whites, it dropped from 14.3 percent to 9 percent. Among Hispanics, the rate dropped 12.3 percent \u2014 though 29.5 percent of Hispanics are still uninsured. A large part of that is likely because of illegal immigrants, who aren\u2019t eligible for Obamacare\u2019s taxpayer-funded coverage.\n\nCongressional Democrats cheered the analysis as proof that their signature law is working and that its critics should put down their knives.\n\n\u201cIt is time for Republicans to end their obsession with destroying the Affordable Care Act and dismantling the health security of so many millions of Americans,\u201d said House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, California Democrat.\n\nRepublicans balked at the news and instead focused on rising premiums and \u201cbroken promises.\u201d\n\nSen. Ted Cruz, Texas Republican and likely presidential contender, predicted that a Republican president would reverse the entirety of President Obama\u2019s signature domestic achievement upon taking office.\n\n\u201cI believe in January of 2017 a new Republican is going to enter the White House and in 2017 is going to sign legislation repealing every word of Obamacare,\u201d Mr. Cruz said, speaking at the Politics and Eggs event in Manchester, New Hampshire.\n\nHHS derived its data from the Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index, which surveys 500 Americans every day on metrics that determine their quality of life and emotions.\n\nEdmund Haislmaier, a senior research fellow at The Heritage Foundation, said that seemed strange because the administration has its own data and should be using that instead of the private companies\u2019 survey.\n\nHe predicted that the administration will revise the numbers downward.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office, which is the government\u2019s nonpartisan official scorekeeper, released an analysis last week that found Obamacare is cheaper and less comprehensive than predicted.\n\nCharles P. Blahous III, a public trustee for the Social Security and Medicare programs, said Monday that the overhaul is cheaper because it has fallen short of promised gains in expanding coverage.\n\n\u201cIt is understandable given the persistent controversies surrounding the ACA that its advocates would want to seize on any report that could appear to shed a favorable light on the law,\u201d he wrote in an op-ed for e21, a website run by the nonprofit Manhattan Institute for Policy Research. \u201cThe latest CBO report, however, does not support the extravagant claims being made on behalf of the ACA.\u201d\n\n\u2981 David Sherfinski contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "More than 16 million Americans have gained insurance coverage in the five years since Obamacare was signed, the administration said Monday in a report designed to cheer the law's \"historic\" strides while Republican lawmakers redouble efforts to scrap it completely.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "More than 16 million Americans have gained insurance coverage in the five years since Obamacare was signed, the administration said Monday in a report designed to cheer the law\u2019s \u201chistoric\u201d strides while Republican lawmakers redouble efforts to scrap it completely.", "title": "HHS touts drop in uninsured rate under Obamacare; 16 million gained coverage", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/mar/16/hhs-touts-drop-uninsured-rate-under-obamacare/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/03/04/ae765a6826b4ce0a6f0f6a7067008cf6.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/03/04/ae765a6826b4ce0a6f0f6a7067008cf6.jpg", "description": "More than 16 million Americans have gained insurance coverage in the five years since Obamacare was signed, the administration said Monday in a report designed to cheer the law's \"historic\" strides wh", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "HHS touts drop in uninsured rate under Obamacare; 16 million gained co"}, "Author": "Tom Howell Jr.", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Social Issues"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2597\"", "article_summary": "Since then, 14.1 million adults have gained coverage, cutting the uninsured rate from 20.3 percent to 13.2 percent.\n\u201cThat\u2019s quite simply a historic reduction in the uninsured rate,\u201d said Meena Seshamani, director of the HHS office of health care reform.\n\u201cHowever, it is most likely that most of these gains are coming from the Medicaid and exchange markets.\u201dThe uninsured rate among blacks dropped 9.2 percent, to 13.2 percent.\nAmong Hispanics, the rate dropped 12.3 percent \u2014 though 29.5 percent of Hispanics are still uninsured.\nA large part of that is likely because of illegal immigrants, who aren\u2019t eligible for Obamacare\u2019s taxpayer-funded coverage."}
