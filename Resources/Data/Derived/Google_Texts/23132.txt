Lindsay Molina had a lot to do before the holidays last December when she found herself coming down with an infection.

"I just needed to see a doctor and get what I needed to get taken care of so I could move on with my life," said the busy mom who works at Marvell Technology in Santa Clara, California.



Instead of taking the morning off, she took her computer into a conference room and logged on to talk to a doctor online.



"She was able to treat me, and then on my way home, I picked up a prescription that she sent to my pharmacy," Molina said.



Her company, Marvell Technology began offering WellPoint's LiveHealth Online service to its staff last fall. Yet, even in the heart of Silicon Valley, it has been a tough sell at the semiconductor firm.



"We've had a slow uptake in convincing people to use the service, I think, because it's such a new idea," explained Margaret Shaw, Marvell's director of global benefits.

The chipmaker hopes the $49 online visits catch on because it could help cut down on the cost of routine care, while also saving employees time.



"It could potentially be a huge cost savings," Shaw explained. "If you go see a regular doctor, your cost is anywhere from $150 to $200 for an office visit. It's a big, big difference."
