A major reason is because dental care is not covered by Medicare and many employers no longer offer post-retirement health benefits. What\u2019s more, the Affordable Care Act allows enrollees to get dental coverage only if they purchase general health coverage first, which many seniors don\u2019t need. At the same time, seniors often require the most costly dental work, like crowns, implants and false teeth.\n\nAccording to a report via AP, Bolzern, a pensioner first attempted to get necessary work done in the US, but after being quoted a fee of $65K by a private dentist to place a crown on every molar the man sought out dental schools in the hope of less expensive work. Nevertheless even work performed by dental students was going to set him back as much as $35 000, leading to the desperate man deciding to head out on a long road trip.\n\nThe trek to Mexico parallels other Americans who choose to cross the border where they are able to pick up much needed medical supplies, including prescription pills for a fraction of the cost here in the US.\n\nGoing abroad for cheaper health care is nothing new. Americans have been doing it for years, for everything from elective, cosmetic procedures to major, life-saving surgery.\n\nThat said, traveling abroad for necessary medical work comes with some risk, with Matthew Messina, a practicing dentist and consumer adviser on behalf of the American Dental Association, advising would be travelers to do a lot of research before they go.\n\nWith lower costs because of cheaper labor and fewer regulatory requirements, Messina also warns that many different countries use different types of equipment, and some items, such as implants, may not have warranties. Malpractice lawsuits the consumer advocate advises may not be an option.\n\nDentists in Los Algodones, Mexico ( a favorite destination of US dental patients) say they attend less school than their counterparts in U.S. but spend more time practicing clinical work. They say they practice the same safety standards as American dentists and have offices that are just as clean.\n\nJos\u00e9 Obed Zu\u00f1iga has been a dentist in Los Algodones for a decade and found business was so good he opened his own shop about two years ago.\n\n\u2018Everything, the quality, is very similar to the United States,\u2018 Zu\u00f1iga said. \u2018We see the work from the United States, and it\u2019s very competitive.\u2019", "article_metadata": {"description": "Mark Bolzern dental care: 'I drove to Mexico to save $65K'.
