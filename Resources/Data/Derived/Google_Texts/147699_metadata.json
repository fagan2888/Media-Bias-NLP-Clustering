But this is only an important first step in closing the gender wage gap. Yet, Senator McConnell voted against it. Time and again, McConnell has made clear where he stands on issues important to women and their families: in the wrong. \u201c\n\nMcConnell twice voted against the Ledbetter law along with opposition to the Paycheck Fairness Act and Violence Against Women Act.\n\nThe Ledbetter endorsement comes a week after Grimes\u2019s campaign pounded a national Republican group for a \u201csexualized\u201d Tweet comparing the Democratic challenger to the Obama girl model.\n\nThose mistakes have put further attention on McConnell\u2019s votes on women\u2019s issues and relationship with female voters. National and state observers have noted Team Mitch\u2019s problems with attacking a vibrant female opponent.\n\n\u201cAlison Lundergan Grimes continues to prove that she is far more concerned with raking in the fundraising cash and gallivanting around Hollywood bragging about how she would be another \u2018yes\u2019 vote for implementing their liberal agenda than she is with actually helping women,\u201d McConnell campaign spokeswoman Allison Moore told WFPL News.\n\nIn September, it was reported Grimes led McConnell by 12 points among women voters in a Public Policy Polling survey. The same poll shows McConnell leading Grimes 51 to 40 percent among men.\n\nOn the campaign trail, however, Grimes is quick to remind Kentuckians she would be the first female senator in the state\u2019s history and her camp pounces on any hint of sexism from GOP operatives.\n\nMcConnell has said this shows Grimes wants to divide voters along gender lines, but for now, the best pivot his team offers appears to be reminding voters that Grimes ignored a sexual harassment controversy involving Democratic lawmakers in the Kentucky legislature.\n\n\u201cIf Alison Lundergan Grimes truly cared about women, then she would have at the very least spoke out against her colleague in Frankfort who was sexually assaulting women in her own workplace and she would speak out against Obamacare, which is causing thousands of Kentucky women and their families to lose their healthcare,\u201d says Moore. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame that Alison will exploit women as the centerpiece of her campaign, but will not give the time of day to the real women who are reaching out for her help.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "89.3 WFPL", "description": "Putting more focus on the gender gap in Kentucky's Senate race, Democratic Senate candidate Alison Lundergan Grimes received the endorsement of pay...", "title": "Lilly Ledbetter Endorses Alison Lundergan Grimes for Senate - 89.3 WFPL", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 284, "identifier": "http://wfpl.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/200909-omag-power-ledbetter-284x426.jpg", "height": 426}, "updated_time": "2014-10-14T16:43:41-04:00", "url": "http://wfpl.org/lilly-ledbetter-endorses-alison-lundergan-grimes-senate/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Putting more focus on the gender gap in Kentucky's Senate race, Democratic Senate candidate Alison Lundergan Grimes received the endorsement of pay...", "creator": "@WFPLNews", "image": "http://wfpl.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/200909-omag-power-ledbetter-284x426.jpg", "title": "Lilly Ledbetter Endorses Alison Lundergan Grimes for Senate - 89.3 WFPL", "site": "@WFPLNews", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 100006229511236, "pages": 33077174555, "app_id": 1539400482939529}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wfpllouisville", "section": "Politics", "tag": "affordable care act", "published_time": "2013-11-26T12:36:04-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-14T16:43:41-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "Putting more focus on the gender gap in Kentucky\u2019s Senate race, Democratic Senate candidate Alison Lundergan Grimes received the endorsement of pay equity advocate Lilly Ledbetter in next year\u2019s election.\nIn September, it was reported Grimes led McConnell by 12 points among women voters in a Public Policy Polling survey.\nThose mistakes have put further attention on McConnell\u2019s votes on women\u2019s issues and relationship with female voters.\n\u201cMcConnell twice voted against the Ledbetter law along with opposition to the Paycheck Fairness Act and Violence Against Women Act.\nThe same poll shows McConnell leading Grimes 51 to 40 percent among men."}
