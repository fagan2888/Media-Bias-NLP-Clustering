Despite the debt, the traffic, the one-party rule, the taxes and the eagerness of politicians to overwhelm small businesses and large corporate job producers with red tape and unnecessary regulations, the Golden State is still the most beautiful place to live and work in the United States. But the political class is making life in California more difficult with every passing day.\n\nThe union mentality and the assault on the successful has overtaken Sacramento, where Democrats control the governor\u2019s office, every state-wide office and have a legislative supermajority.\n\nMost Republicans in California are tired of fighting the one-party rule from the left and have given up on state politics.\n\n[pullquote]\n\nThey think it\u2019s wise to let the Democrats\u2019 ideas fail without getting in the way. They believe the Democrats are like the PRI in Mexico, overplaying their hand and unable to blame anyone else for the state\u2019s problems.\n\nOther Republicans, like gubernatorial candidate Neel Kashkari, are making the case to voters that there is still time to turn away from the spendthrift, debt-ridden entitlement policies bankrupting the state. Kashkari is an unapologetic, small government Republican who seems undeterred by Republican apathy.\n\nStill other Republicans, like gubernatorial candidate Tim Donnelly, are strangely trying to embrace the left\u2019s economic policies and draw a distinction with the left on social policies.\n\nFailed economic policies combined with conservative social values are a double whammy for politicians in the most liberal state in America.\n\nDonnelly\u2019s record is a litany of failure, at best displaying incompetence and at worst bordering on corruption. He supports redevelopment agencies, an out of control, secret property redevelopment system that gives political appointees a firm grip on handing out favors and picking winners and losers to get campaign contributions in return.\n\nHe supports tax credits for Hollywood, too.\n\nHis criminal record, including larceny and campaign finance violations, is well-known. His was the lone \u2018no\u2019 vote on state assembly bills to help veterans find jobs and to stop prescription drug abuse. He further distinguished himself in the state assembly by using taxpayer funds to pay for gifts, cars, and holidays.\n\nDonnelly is one of the most bizarre candidates in the history of California\u2019s gubernatorial races, a state which has seen everything from action-film movie stars to pornographers.\n\nCombined with his tough anti-immigrant stance and penchant for making offensive comments (he has compared President Obama to Adolf Hitler and accused Kashkari of supporting Shariah law), it\u2019s unclear which California constituency Donnelly hopes to appeal to. And yet he leads Kashkari in the primary where mainly party activists pick the nominee.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s beleaguered Republicans need to unite around someone who has a shot at taking on the rarely seen but well-funded Jerry Brown.\n\nA Donnelly nomination this week would further denigrate the Golden State\u2019s long-suffering GOP. It\u2019s been difficult enough for California Republicans to offer a compelling alternative to the Democrats\u2019 hyper-liberal government agenda. Tarring their image by nominating an offensive, corrupt and amoral candidate like Donnelly will only make the party\u2019s job harder than it already is.\n\nAccording to Stanford\u2019s Hoover Institution, Kashkari now trails Donnelly by five points.\n\nThe California GOP leadership must find a way to turn that around before Tuesday\u2019s June 3 primary. If it can\u2019t, Tim Donnelly may prove that the California GOP hasn\u2019t quite hit bottom yet.\n\nRichard Grenell is a Fox News Contributor.
