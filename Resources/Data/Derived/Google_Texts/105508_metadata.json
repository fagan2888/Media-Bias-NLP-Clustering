But Biden unwittingly stole the spotlight by introducing Obama, embracing him and saying \u2013 loudly enough for the podium microphone to capture it \u2013 'This is a big f***ing deal.'\n\n'[A] piece of advice about that \"BFD\" stuff: Assume every microphone is on,' Biden told a crowd gathered on Monday at the starting line of the annual Ride 2 Recovery Memorial Challenge, a cycling event that raises money for wounded-veterans charities.\n\nScroll down for video of the infamous moment\n\nI didn't mean it: Biden insisted he never intentionally called the Obamacare signing 'a big f***ing deal,' but his words looking intentional on network video feeds\n\nGaffer-in-chief: Biden's famous moments have included asking a wheelchair-bound local politician to stand up and acknowledge applause,and saying of the 2009 federal stimulus that there was 'a 30% chance we're going to get it wrong'\n\nRiders travel 325 miles from Washington, D.C. to Virginia Beach every year on Memorial Day for the event.\n\n'I just want you to know, I didn't intentionally say that,' he added, according to CNN.\n\n\n\n'I actually turned and I said, \"Mr. President,\" and I whispered in his ear. Unfortunately, I was looking in the direction of one guy who could actually read lips \u2014 not a joke. Because no one picked it up at the time and one of the reporters read lips.'\n\n\n\n'Thank God my mother was gone or I'd have been one dead vice president.'\n\nHis words, however, were clearly audible and went out on every broadcast network covering the event.\n\nThe Associated Press reported at the time that 'Biden appeared to be offering that perspective to Obama privately.'\n\nMoments later, then-White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs tweeted, 'And yes, Mr. Vice President, you're right.'\n\n\n\nA Ride 2 Recovery coordinator who introduced Biden playfully warned the crowd that 'for those of you who don't know, Joe is famous for some of his one liners.'\n\n'There was a bill signing at the White House ... and he said it was a \"big f-ing deal.\" And that was a quote ... If I may say, sir, Ride to Recovery is a big f-ing deal.'\n\nThe introduction also included the prediction that 'at some point in the future Joe is going to run for president again.'\n\nIn response, Biden was seen making a dramatic sign of the cross on his body.\n\nBiden's mouth often out-runs his brain, as he proved in 2010 with an open microphone and an F-bomb\n\nGoofball: Biden mugged for a camera with Obama to launch his Instagram account, but was better-known for saying that in his home state of Delaware, 'you cannot go to a 7-11 or a Dunkin' Donuts unless you have a slight Indian accent. I'm not joking.'\n\nThe vice president, who is mulling a White House run in 2016, also mentioned the controversy swirling around the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, which is accused of using phony off-the-books waiting lists to mask its failure to provide timely health care to battle-tested servicemen and women.\n\n'That is a sacred obligation, and we\u2019re behind right now,' the he conceded. 'The VA is having problems, and we\u2019ve got to get to the bottom of it.'", "article_metadata": {"Rating": "General", "news_keywords": "Assume,microphone,Gaffe,prone,Biden,recalls,big,f,ing,deal,moment,Obamacare,signing", "original-source": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2639964/Assume-microphone-Gaffe-prone-Biden-recalls-big-f-ing-deal-moment-Obamacare-signing.html", "doc-class": "Living Document", "twitter": {"description": "'I just want you to know, I didn't intentionally say that,' the VP said at a bike-ride charity event for wounded veterans.
