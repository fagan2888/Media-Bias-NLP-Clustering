Lowe was joined by his partner, Connie Self, who told the crowd the movie about his life will have its world premiere Nov. 2 at the Banff Mountain Film Festival.\n\n\u201d Jeff Lowe\u2019s Metanoia\u201d chronicles his climbing achievements and his battle with a motor-neuron disease similar to ALS that is slowly killing him. A highlight video mesmerized the crowd, and when Mayo took the stage he addressed Lowe directly.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so hard, in a way, to see you this way,\u201d Mayo said. \u201cAnd yet the manner in which you are dealing with it is so inspiring. It\u2019s inspiring to see you deal with a situation with such grace. We\u2019re all terminally ill, we\u2019re all not long for this world. It\u2019s just a matter of what we do with what we\u2019ve got in the meantime.\u201d\n\nSome would say it\u2019s a miracle Lowe is still alive.\n\nLowe\u2019s prognosis was grim last May. Lowe and Self were hoping he would live long enough to attend a June 24 tribute in his honor in Boulder, but prospects weren\u2019t good.\n\n\u201cHe was dire,\u201d said Self, who speaks for Lowe because the disease has impaired Lowe\u2019s ability to speak. \u201cMay was very challenging. He signed a \u2018do not resuscitate\u2019 order. \u2026 He looked awful. The doctor said, \u2018He won\u2019t make it until June 24. Three weeks, max.\u2019 \u201c\n\nRemarkable turnaroundBut Lowe has made a remarkable turnaround since coming to realize the high levels of pure oxygen he was inhaling on a respirator \u2014 as much as 18 liters per minute \u2014 were causing some of his problems. The percentage of oxygen in the air our bodies were designed to breathe is about 21 percent. Pure oxygen can be toxic, especially at such high levels. Sensing that was part of his problem, Lowe weaned himself from pure oxygen to the point where he doesn\u2019t use any during the day and uses only 1 to 2 liters per minute at night.\n\n\u201cPeople ask him, \u2018How did you do that?\u2019 He said, \u2018It\u2019s a spiritual solution to a physical problem,\u2019 \u201d Self said.\n\nThe distended belly and puffy face that Lowe exhibited in May are gone. He has been able to cut back on his medications. Having had five frightening bouts of pneumonia between January and May, he hasn\u2019t had one since he cut back the oxygen.\n\nLowe\u2019s home hospice care- givers were asked to provide a medical explanation for this story but they declined, citing policy.\n\n\u201cThe doctor did say, \u2018Oh, yes, supplemental oxygen is toxic,\u2019 because we don\u2019t breathe pure oxygen,\u201d Self said. \u201cWhen you start to get really high levels of oxygen, all your blood gases get really screwed up. But no one tells you that, because they had never had anybody on those high levels.\u201d\n\nIn May, Lowe and Self were planning for his death, but now they are planning a future. He looks forward to attending the premiere of his film next month in Canada. A few days later they will travel to England for a film festival there.\n\nThe disease still is killing him slowly, but they believe addressing the oxygen issue has extended his life expectancy.\n\n\u201cI will still probably die of aspiration-caused pneumonia,\u201d Lowe said. \u201cI can go along breathing well, then I might aspirate on something, develop pneumonia and be gone in a week. I\u2019m very happy to see the film being finished, to be able to influence the film right up until the end, and to be able to go to the premiere. It\u2019s kind of like that old Mark Twain quote: Rumors of my death are highly exaggerated.\u201d\n\n\u201cWonderful, inspiring\u201d\n\nThrough his iPad, Lowe spoke to the crowd at the mountaineering center.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t tell you how happy I am to be here to be able to see what one of my young heroes, Will Mayo, has to share with us,\u201d Lowe said, \u201cbut also to be able to announce that our film, \u2018Jeff Lowe\u2019s Metanoia,\u2019 is finally done. Better yet, I think there\u2019s a very good chance that I will actually be able to attend one more time my favorite climbing festival, the 2015 Ouray Ice Festival. Please join me in support of this incredible climbing resource. I hope to see you in just a few months.\u201d\n\nAfter showing highlights, Self summarized what the film was about for the crowd.\n\n\u201cClimbing was Jeff\u2019s medium, but really the story is about life and what you make of it and how you deal with it,\u201d Self said. \u201cIt\u2019s a really wonderful, inspiring human-interest story. We\u2019re super psyched that Jeff is still here. It\u2019s just Jeff continuing to do what people say is not possible. That\u2019s who Jeff is, that\u2019s what he does.\u201d\n\nJohn Meyer: 303-954-1616, jmeyer@denverpost.com or twitter.com/johnmeyer", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Legendary climber Jeff Lowe making remarkable turnaround in battle with disease", "title": "Legendary climber Jeff Lowe making remarkable turnaround in battle with disease", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/10/18/legendary-climber-jeff-lowe-making-remarkable-turnaround-in-battle-with-disease/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141018__20141019_CC12_SP19OUTLOWEp1.jpg", "height": 466}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141018__20141019_CC12_SP19OUTLOWEp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-10-18T19:44:20+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T23:35:52+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Fishing, hunting"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf9df\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThe doctor did say, \u2018Oh, yes, supplemental oxygen is toxic,\u2019 because we don\u2019t breathe pure oxygen,\u201d Self said.\nA few days later they will travel to England for a film festival there.\nPure oxygen can be toxic, especially at such high levels.\n\u201d Jeff Lowe\u2019s Metanoia\u201d chronicles his climbing achievements and his battle with a motor-neuron disease similar to ALS that is slowly killing him.\n\u201cHe was dire,\u201d said Self, who speaks for Lowe because the disease has impaired Lowe\u2019s ability to speak."}
