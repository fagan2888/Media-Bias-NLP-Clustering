Or could King actually ski triumphantly to gold?\n\nMy money, alas, is on the former scenario.\n\nAdmittedly, Zynga has been on a tear of late, having soared 35 percent since the beginning of the year, even as the stock market itself has largely languished in the doldrums, partly thanks to some impressive earnings. But its biggest gain came Tuesday, on the heels of King's IPO filing.\n\nIn spite of Zynga\u2019s recent gains, the stock still languishes well below its IPO price, and hovers at about a third of its all-time high of nearly $15 a share. Moreover, its recent advance is a great example of investors putting the cart before the horse. The buzz surrounding a hot new game (remember Zynga\u2019s \u201cFarmVille\u201d?) and a hot new gaming company isn\u2019t proof that it\u2019s possible to build a sustainable and successful company capable of generating impressive returns over the long haul.\n\nRelated: How Zynga Lost Its Zing to a New Gaming King\n\nClearly, \u201cCandy Crush\u201d is addictive. Some two dozen otherwise rational Facebook friends of mine keep informing me of their progress in the game. And King is highly profitable, recording net income of $567.6 million last year, up from $7.8 million in 2012; revenues have soared from $164.4 million in 2012 to an astonishing $1.88 billion last year. That\u2019s more than double Zynga\u2019s revenue of $873 million in 2013 \u2013 and Zynga has yet to post a profit.\n\nSo far, so good. King has done a fabulous job delivering \u201cCandy Crush\u201d to addicts via mobile devices.\n\nHere\u2019s the rub: To be bullish about King\u2019s future, you have to believe the company\u2019s creative team can do it again. And again. And again. Ad infinitum. You need to be confident that winning streak will continue, and that the team can not only fend off rivals but stay ahead of the curve of whatever gamers want next, even when it means figuring out what those gamers want before they know it themselves.\n\nAbove all, King will have to ensure its next hit game is structured in such a way that those players are willing to pay out for options (\u201cin-app\u201d transactions) that help them score more points.\n\nRelated: Candy Crush \u2014 The Sweet and Profitable Gaming Allure\n\nEventually, gamers start looking around for something new. We have seen that happen with \u201cFarmVille\u201d \u2014 some of those former addicts are numbered among those now begging for my help with their \u201cCandy Crush\u201d obsessions. And we\u2019ll see it again. The barriers to entry are relatively low.\n\nIn contrast to social media platforms like Facebook, LinkedIn or Twitter, it\u2019s hard to wrap my mind around the idea of a gaming company becoming \u201cthe\u201d go-to publisher. One game does not necessarily build a franchise, and it certainly doesn\u2019t help to build a wide competitive moat.\n\nRegardless of your personal views about Facebook and its single-minded determination to sweep up and sell to advertisers as much personal data as possible, it remains the baseline social networking site. True, challengers may eventually supplant it, but the company just celebrated its 10th birthday and it likely still has many years ahead of it at the top of the heap.\n\nThe shelf life of a successful game is significantly shorter. Really \u2013 who still plays \u201cRollercoaster Tycoon\u201d? That\u2019s why video game franchises like \u201cCall of Duty\u201d have dozens of sequels, designed to reinforce user loyalty. Even Slate culture critic June Thomas, a self-confessed Candy junkie, commented last summer that her interest in the game was \"already waning.\u201d (No word yet on whether she\u2019s located a \u201cCandy Crush\u201d 12-step program to help wean her off her addiction.)\n\nThere\u2019s another risk: protecting intellectual property. Already, King is embroiled in a dispute with a rival claiming that \u201cCandy Crush\u201d is a ripoff of their existing game. And let\u2019s face it: \u201cCandy Crush\u201d is really just a variant of the venerable \u201cBejeweled,\u201d which also required players to match three or more items in rows, columns or other groupings. The difference? Rather than buying the game up front, gamers have to pay to repurchase lost \u201clives,\u201d or to access new levels and features. The key difference is one of economics to the developer, not in the game itself.\n\nThere\u2019s even a risk, as England\u2019s Daily Mail suggested, that regulators may want to scrutinize its appeal to younger users and that \u2013 gasp \u2013 \u201cCandy Crush Saga\u201d could even be a kind of gateway drug to more hardcore gambling.\n\nYou don\u2019t need to take that kind of dire view to consider that King just might not be the ideal stock to add to your portfolio. \u201cCandy Crush\u201d still accounts for 73 percent of King\u2019s active users and 78 percent of its bookings. Yes, the company is about a decade old, but its success is tied to that single game and there\u2019s no evidence \u2013 in the industry itself or within King specifically \u2013 that it will keep churning out hits for years to come.\n\nWhen you buy a stock, you\u2019re buying into the future, not what has already happened. True, underwriters JPMorgan Chase and Credit Suisse hope to sell a bright future to you, but unless you\u2019ve got a pronounced appetite for volatility and risk, I\u2019d suggest politely declining the invitation.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "To be bullish about King\u2019s future, you have to believe the company\u2019s creative team can do it again.
