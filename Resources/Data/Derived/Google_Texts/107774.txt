A local high school's career preparation program celebrated their birthday and honored some students.

Mosley High School's pre-medical program prepares students for the demanding college classes.

Saturday, at Captain Anderson's Restaurant students, staff and family celebrated the program's one year anniversary.

More than 180 students in the program received special pins for their lab coats.

Dr. John Wade, a director of the pre-med program talked about the future he thinks the students have.

"The kids are on their way to a bright future," explained Wade. "Not only a bright future, but a brilliant future. These kids are preparing themselves for college for their careers, they know exactly what they want to do in life. As a result, they are taking their tests more seriously, they are more focused."
