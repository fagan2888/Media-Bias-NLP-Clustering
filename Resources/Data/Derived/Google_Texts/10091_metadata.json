He changed the way quarterbacks operate at the line of scrimmage,\u201d said ESPN analyst Mark Schlereth, who won two Super Bowls as a guard with the Broncos in the 1990s. \u201cSo to see him get replaced, it\u2019s a difficult thing to watch. But there are very few John Elways in this world who go out winning a championships and say, \u2018See ya.\u2019 \u201c\n\nSunday the 39-year-old, Hall of Fame-bound Manning will be a healthy backup for the first time in his NFL career. Osweiler, 25, who never made an NFL start before this season, will be under center again.\n\nThe playoffs are rushing toward the Broncos. A victory at home Sunday over the San Diego Chargers would net Denver no worse than a No. 2 seed and a first-round bye.\n\nBut the Broncos\u2019 quarterback questions aren\u2019t going away. And their fans are nervous.\n\n\u201cManning was great for the Broncos. I loved him. But you can only play football for so long. And he\u2019s been fighting a losing battle,\u201d said Denver\u2019s Nancy Levine, a second-generation season-ticket holder. Her father first grabbed season tickets in 1964, more than 30 years before the Broncos won their first championship.\n\nIn the past 15 years, the Broncos have thrown out quarterback questions like red challenge flags. Jay Cutler replaced Jake Plummer midseason in 2006. Tebow bumped aside Kyle Orton in 2011.\n\n\u201cOsweiler has earned the starting spot. And I\u2019m excited,\u201d Levine said. \u201cBut if feeling good means, \u2018Do I think we\u2019re going to the Super Bowl?\u2019 Then, I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nBroncos fans are wearing their indecision. Holiday sales of Osweiler jerseys at the store at Dove Valley team headquarters kicked up. But Manning sales still dominate \u2014 the first jersey you see inside the door is a signed Manning jersey in a glass case, above an Elway jersey.\n\nAt SportsFan, an independent apparel retailer with an outpost next to the Broncos\u2019 stadium, fan demand for jerseys is a week-to-week proposition.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re always trying to balance what the customers are saying what they want right now and what they could want tomorrow,\u201d said Derek Friedman, SportsFan\u2019s owner. \u201cWith Osweiler, he\u2019s not under contract for next year. So it\u2019s definitely a delicate dance.\u201d\n\nOsweiler\u2019s rookie deal with the Broncos ends after this season. He\u2019s playing for a contract as well as the playoffs.\n\nBut zoom out of the Broncos bubble for a minute. What if, two months from now, the Broncos look back after losing in the playoffs and say they left Manning \u2014 Peyton Manning! 71,871 career passing yards! \u2014 on the bench? That\u2019s a difficult idea to grasp.\n\n\u201cI get it. It sounds crazy,\u201d Schlereth said. \u201cBut the bottom line is, as a franchise, if you\u2019re realistic and you take the fan hat off, what are your chances really with their deficiencies to make it to the Super Bowl? Peyton Manning isn\u2019t playing with the Broncos next year, so wouldn\u2019t you like to see Brock play in pressure situations?\u201d\n\nThe mania around Tebow\u2019s takeover from Orton and his wobbly run to the playoffs in 2011 cannot be overstated. It was nuts \u2014 one of the strangest, wildest periods in Denver sports history.\n\nManning\u2019s arrival with the Broncos in 2012 \u2014 Elway, as general manager, signed him to a five-year, $96 million contract \u2014 finally quieted the Tebow storm. Manning was meant to finally settle the Broncos into a solid quarterback situation, for the first time since Elway won back-to-back Super Bowls as quarterback in 1998 and 1999.\n\nThey\u2019re now full circle back to another quarterback quandary, this time with Manning on the outs.\n\n\u201cI could tell something was wrong with Peyton. He just wasn\u2019t himself,\u201d said Highlands Ranch\u2019s Gary Penfield, a season-ticket holder since 1993. \u201cGiven the integrity he displays for the game, it was admirable he finally stepped down to give Brock a chance.\u201d\n\nPenfield sat through a bitterly cold Monday night with his daughter, Christine, to watch another Osweiler nail-biter. The Broncos rallied in the second half for a 20-17 overtime victory over the Cincinnati Bengals to clinch a playoff berth.\n\nThat win bought Osweiler another week as a starter. Manning returned Wednesday from a foot injury to practice as a full participant with the team for the first time since November.\n\nBut Denver coach Gary Kubiak, a former backup quarterback for Elway, said Manning will be No. 2 at the position Sunday. It wasn\u2019t enough for some fans to close the door on Manning.\n\n\u201cIt was never in me to write Peyton off,\u201d Penfield said. \u201cHe\u2019s more than proved he\u2019s a Hall of Fame quarterback. And I still don\u2019t write him off. If we can win this last game, I think Peyton, if he needs to come in and play, he\u2019ll do just fine.\u201d\n\nThe Manning-to-Osweiler handoff left the Broncos with a conundrum. But they\u2019re 11-4. And the other top teams in the AFC, including the Bengals and New England Patriots, have their own questions and problems to deal with. The amount of hope around Denver is bigger than the difference beween Manning and Osweiler.\n\n\u201cWhen I listen and talk to fans at the store, they\u2019re enjoying the ride of the team more than focusing on No. 17 or 18,\u201d Friedman said. \u201cThey really just want a W. And as long as they\u2019re delivering W\u2019s, fans just want to root for orange.\u201d\n\nNick Groke: ngroke@denverpost.com or @nickgroke\n\nPassing judgment\n\nWith the Broncos trailing 14-3 at halftime Monday against the Bengals, a Denver Post online poll overwhelmingly favored Peyton Manning as the Broncos\u2019 starting quarterback. He had 65 percent support compared with Trevor Siemian\u2019s 23 percent and Brock Osweiler\u2019s 12 percent. By the end of the game, Manning still had strong support (64 percent) but Osweiler\u2019s stock rose to 18 percent, tied with Siemian. But by Thursday, the polling totals swung wildly back to Osweiler, a first-year starter:\n\nWHO SHOULD BE DENVER\u2019S STARTING QUARTERBACK AGAINST SAN DIEGO?\n\n59.2%\n\nBrock Osweiler\n\n34.7%\n\nPeyton Manning\n\n6.1%\n\nTrevor Siemian\n\nTotal votes: 6,984 through Saturday", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Brock Osweiler or Peyton Manning: Broncos stuck in awkward place at QB", "title": "Brock Osweiler or Peyton Manning: Broncos stuck in awkward place at QB", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/01/02/brock-osweiler-or-peyton-manning-broncos-stuck-in-awkward-place-at-qb/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160102__BN20160103_CC1_BNSP03FBNQBDEBATEp2.jpg", "height": 408}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160102__BN20160103_CC1_BNSP03FBNQBDEBATEp2.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-02T22:24:18+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-18T23:00:30+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Brock Osweiler, Peyton Manning"}, "article_summary": "What if, two months from now, the Broncos look back after losing in the playoffs and say they left Manning \u2014 Peyton Manning!\nBut the Broncos\u2019 quarterback questions aren\u2019t going away.\nBy the end of the game, Manning still had strong support (64 percent) but Osweiler\u2019s stock rose to 18 percent, tied with Siemian.\n\u201cWith Osweiler, he\u2019s not under contract for next year.\n\u201cPeyton Manning has changed the way this game is viewed."}
