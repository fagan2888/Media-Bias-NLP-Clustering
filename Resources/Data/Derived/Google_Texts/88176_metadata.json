But before you pass judgment on our men and women in blue, I must ask, have you taken the time to live in their shoes? Have you had a ride-along? Have you experienced an advanced shooting simulation course? Have you ever attended the funeral of a slain officer whose hesitation to use force may have gotten him or her killed?\n\nHaving known officers who had to fire their weapons, I\u2019ve seen the emotional trauma they experience, including the fear their families live with each day. We as a city require they bear a heavy responsibility, make split-second, life-altering decisions, and accept being spat upon, kicked and shot at in the line of duty. The least we can do is not second guess them from the comfort of our keyboards, enjoying the safety they provide.\n\n\u2014 Jim Lewis, Long Beach\n\nRepublicans must stop Obamacare bailout\n\nRe \u201cStop the bailout of insurance companies before it begins\u201d (Charles Krauthammer, Jan. 2):\n\nThe Obama administration will stop at nothing to save Obamacare. The administration is promising new subsidies to cover the losses private insurance companies are facing \u2014 the same companies that lobbied for Obamacare.\n\nObamacare is falling apart at the seams, and taxpayers shouldn\u2019t be on the hook for a costly bailout. Stopping the bailout could stop Obamacare permanently. Republicans should do everything they can to stop Obamacare.\n\n\u2014 Douglas Kasai, Lakewood\n\nLink between climate change and drought?\n\nRe \u201c\u2018Megadrought\u2019 could have catastrophic effects on California\u201d (Jan. 25):\n\nGreat article putting our drought into historical perspective, but a lot more needs to be said about how climate change will play out. The bottom line is we don\u2019t know, but all the climate predictions point in the same direction \u2014 more frequent and severe droughts.\n\nGraham Kent, a University of Nevada geophysicist who has studied submerged ancient trees in Fallen Leaf Lake near Lake Tahoe, calls our current situation \u201can experiment,\u201d and that is exactly what it is. Humankind is the guinea pig in this experiment. We don\u2019t know how bad things will get if we continue to rely on fossil fuel, but former Energy Secretary Steven Chu said he can\u2019t imagine California agriculture in 2100. It\u2019s hard even to imagine California, if we don\u2019t get serious about climate change.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe good news is there is a growing consensus among politicians and big business that a revenue-neutral carbon tax is the foundational first step needed if we want to put an end to the experiment.\n\n\u2014 Mark Tabbert, Newport Beach\n\nFireworks shows wreak havoc on neighborhoods\n\nRe \u201cLift the ban, fireworks part of July Fourth\u201d (Letters, Jan. 27):\n\nLetter writer Mike Gallo must not live in Lakewood or he would know there is no such thing as a five- or 10-minute fireworks show. The streets are blocked, the ladders are set up and it is like a war zone. Try driving down the street to get home and needing to protect your car because people won\u2019t get out of the way. And then there is the morning after when you get to enjoy all the trash left behind.\n\n\u2014 Mary Pearson, Lakewood", "article_metadata": {"description": "Try putting yourself in a police officer\u2019s shoesRe \u201cLong Beach pays for bad police decisions\u201d (Editorial, Jan. 23):I won\u2019t downplay the seriousness of the charges against our", "title": "Try putting yourself in a police officer\u2019s shoes: Letters", "og": {"url": "http://www.presstelegram.com/opinion/20140128/try-putting-yourself-in-a-police-officers-shoes-letters", "image": {"width": "512px", "identifier": "http://local.presstelegram.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/small/presstelegram_new.png", "height": "512px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Try putting yourself in a police officer\u2019s shoes: Letters"}, "twitter": {"domain": "presstelegram.com", "description": "Try putting yourself in a police officer\u2019s shoesRe \u201cLong Beach pays for bad police decisions\u201d (Editorial, Jan. 23):I won\u2019t downplay the seriousness of the charges against our", "title": "Try putting yourself in a police officer\u2019s shoes: Letters", "url": "http://www.presstelegram.com/opinion/20140128/try-putting-yourself-in-a-police-officers-shoes-letters", "image": {"src": "http://local.presstelegram.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/small/presstelegram.png?052016"}, "site": "@presstelegram", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id551754518", "iphone": "id502958939", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.longbeachpresstelegram"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "Opinion, Opinion news, Long Beach Opinion news, CA Opinion news, US Opinion news, world Opinion news.", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Opinion, Opinion news, Long Beach Opinion news, CA Opinion news, US Opinion news, world Opinion news."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdefd7\"", "article_summary": "Try putting yourself in a police officer\u2019s shoesRe \u201cLong Beach pays for bad police decisions\u201d (Editorial, Jan. 23):I won\u2019t downplay the seriousness of the charges against our officers, nor do I give law enforcement carte blanche.\nThe bottom line is we don\u2019t know, but all the climate predictions point in the same direction \u2014 more frequent and severe droughts.\nRepublicans should do everything they can to stop Obamacare.\nStopping the bailout could stop Obamacare permanently.\nWe don\u2019t know how bad things will get if we continue to rely on fossil fuel, but former Energy Secretary Steven Chu said he can\u2019t imagine California agriculture in 2100."}
