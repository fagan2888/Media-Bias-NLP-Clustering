Wester of Salt Lake City and chairman of the conference\u2019s committee on communications. \u201cIt\u2019s not something that\u2019s adversarial.\u201d\n\nThe last time the section of the directives was revised was 2001.\n\nAccording to the conference, the Vatican outlines principles \u201cto ensure that Catholic healthcare institutions neither cooperate immorally with the unacceptable procedures conducted in other healthcare entities with which they may be connected nor cause scandal as a result of their collaboration with such other entities.\u201d\n\nAs hospitals and medical providers have merged, a gray area has developed between secular and religious providers.\n\nFederal health care mandates also have prompted challenges and court cases, notably the Hobby Lobby case, in which the Supreme Court determined that the administration cannot force closely held private companies to pay for contraception in their health insurance plans if it violates their religious beliefs.\n\n\u201cI stand to say how important it is from my point of view that we do undertake this study because of what has happened in the last 12 years in health care,\u201d said Bishop William Murphy of Rockville Centre, New York. \u201cTwenty years ago we were talking about cooperation today we are involved in such things as buying physicians\u2019 practices, [and] different groups are looking at what we\u2019re doing and who we can work with in insurance coverage. It makes it really very important for us to do the best we can to illuminate Catholic principles in cooperation.\u201d\n\nIn other matters, the bishops also approved Tuesday the first English translation of the ritual book \u201cExorcisms and Related Supplications,\u201d and gave the go-ahead to draft updates to the \u201cGuidelines for the Celebration of the Sacraments with Persons with Disabilities.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe current document was approved by the body of bishops in 1995, but since 1995 a number of significant developments in medicine and research have taken place,\u201d said Bishop Arthur J. Serratelli of Paterson, New Jersey. \u201cOur goal is to ensure those with special needs have easy access to sacraments with appropriate accommodations.\u201d\n\nThis can include people who cannot receive Holy Communion because they have celiac disease and cannot eat gluten \u2014 and thus the Eucharistic wafer \u2014 and Catholic faithful who might have a form of autism or other disability that limits verbal speech, to name just a few examples, said Bishop Serratelli, chairman of the Conference\u2019s committee on divine worship.\n\n\u201cI can tell you, brothers, there are still horror stories of people disabled in various ways rejected by the church because of ignorance or bad will,\u201d said Cardinal Daniel N. DiNardo of Galveston-Houston, Texas. \u201cThat\u2019s one thing we don\u2019t have to do at all. It could be [we were] nervous about these things that\u2019s why this could be of assistance to us [in providing] sacramental life for our brothers and sisters.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "U.S. Catholic bishops on Tuesday overwhelmingly approved revising directives that eventually would make it easier for Catholic health care providers to work with secular providers while maintaining doctrinal positions on birth control, abortion, euthanasia and other health issues.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "U.S. Catholic bishops on Tuesday overwhelmingly approved revising directives that eventually would make it easier for Catholic health care providers to work with secular providers while maintaining doctrinal positions on birth control, abortion, euthanasia and other health issues.", "title": "Bishops OK directive revisions for Catholic health care providers", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/nov/11/bishops-ok-directive-revisions-for-catholic-health/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/11/11/11112014_ap0911160336708201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/11/11/11112014_ap0911160336708201.jpg", "description": "U.S. Catholic bishops on Tuesday overwhelmingly approved revising directives that eventually would make it easier for Catholic health care providers to work with secular providers while maintaining do", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Bishops OK directive revisions for Catholic health care providers"}, "Author": "Meredith Somers", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Religion Belief, Social Issues"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fceaf1\"", "article_summary": "BALTIMORE \u2014 U.S. Catholic bishops on Tuesday overwhelmingly approved revising directives that eventually would make it easier for Catholic health care providers to work with secular providers while maintaining doctrinal positions on birth control, abortion, euthanasia and other health issues.\nIn a 213 to 2 vote, with one abstention, the 2014 General Assembly of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops approved an action item to move ahead with the revision to a section of the \u201cEthical and Religious Directives for Catholic Health Care Services,\u201d which will need to be brought back to the bishops in draft form at a later date.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not something that\u2019s adversarial.\u201dThe last time the section of the directives was revised was 2001.\nFederal health care mandates also have prompted challenges and court cases, notably the Hobby Lobby case, in which the Supreme Court determined that the administration cannot force closely held private companies to pay for contraception in their health insurance plans if it violates their religious beliefs.\n\u201cI stand to say how important it is from my point of view that we do undertake this study because of what has happened in the last 12 years in health care,\u201d said Bishop William Murphy of Rockville Centre, New York."}
