Jeb Bush speaks to reporters as he leaves an event in New York on Thursday. (Seth Wenig/AP)\n\nRepublican presidential hopeful Jeb Bush supports President Obama\u2019s trade deal, praises his management of the National Security Agency and agrees that Congress should have moved faster to hold a vote on new attorney general Loretta E. Lynch.\n\nAnd that\u2019s all since last week.\n\nIt\u2019s an unusual approach for Bush in seeking the nomination of a conservative party that mostly loathes the current president. The former Florida governor has gone out of his way at times to chime in on issues where he agrees with Obama \u2014 bolstering his attempt to be a softer-toned kind of Republican focused on winning a majority of the vote in a general election.\n\nBut the strategy also carries grave risks for a likely candidate who is already viewed with deep suspicion by conservatives, many of whom have little desire to find common ground with Democrats. Tea party leaders are already warning that Bush, the son and brother of former presidents, is alienating conservatives.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s stunning, frankly, that a candidate on the Republican side would be doing his best to line himself up with some of the president\u2019s policies,\u201d said Mark Meckler, \u00adco-founder of the Tea Party Patriots who now leads a group called Citizens for Self-Governance.\n\nFormer Florida Gov. Jeb Bush leaves after speaking at a Republican Leadership Summit in Nashua, N.H., on April 17, 2015. (Jim Cole/AP)\n\nBush\u2019s tone, he added, puts him \u201cout of step with the American people.\u201d\n\nThe former Florida governor is hardly an Obama booster, of course. He regularly attacks Obama\u2019s foreign policy and his handling of domestic issues such as the economy and the Keystone XL pipeline. He calls the Affordable Care Act a \u201cmonstrosity\u201d that should be overhauled.\n\n[In drive to be 45th president, Jeb Bush faces legacies of the 41st and 43rd]\n\nBut Bush is sticking to his support for education and immigration reforms \u2014 positions unpopular with many GOP voters. And his tendency to refrain from being too aggressive in his attacks on Obama reflects his absence from what he often calls the years-long \u201cfood fight\u201d between the current White House and congressional Republicans.\n\nDavid Bozell, the president of For America, a conservative group strongly opposed to a Bush presidential bid, said the candidate is clouding his criticisms of Obama by \u201cdropping these little nuggets of support.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s kept his gloves on, I suppose,\u201d Bozell said.\n\n\u201cA lot of people are noticing. Not a day goes by where I don\u2019t get an e-mail about his latest statements,\u201d said Erick Erickson, a radio show host and founder of the conservative Red State blog. \u201cHe has said in the past he is concerned about the tone and rhetoric of the primary season, but I think he has overcorrected to the point of sounding more closely aligned to the president than \u00adHillary Clinton.\u201d\n\nLast week, Bush urged Republican senators to move ahead with the confirmation of Lynch, saying he had concerns with her nomination but that \u201cpresidents have the right to pick their team.\u201d\n\nThen on Tuesday, Bush was asked in a radio interview what he thought was an accomplishment of the Obama administration, and he credited the president for sticking with the National Security Agency\u2019s bulk collection of phone data \u201ceven though he never defends it.\u201d\n\nA day later, he reiterated his support for an Obama trade agreement that is gaining bipartisan support in Congress, while faulting Clinton for hedging on the deal.\n\nFarther back, Bush offered Obama modest praise for continuing efforts started by Bush\u2019s brother, George W. Bush, to tighten sanctions on Iran as it developed its nuclear program.\n\n\u201cThe president, to his credit, was successful in bringing other people along and making it tougher,\u201d Bush said during a recent appearance in Denver when asked how he would have handled Iran. \u201cI\u2019m not a big Obama fan, but when he does something right we need to give him credit.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, Bush says he strongly opposes the recent interim deal with Iran brokered by the Obama administration and other world powers. On Thursday, he reportedly called the agreement \u201cvery naive.\u201d\n\nAs he prepares to officially launch his campaign, Bush is traveling the country to meet with voters in early primary campaign states such as Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, along with places not usually visited until a general election campaign: Colorado, Georgia, Massachusetts, New York, Ohio and, next week, Puerto Rico.\n\nIn New Hampshire last week, he was questioned about his support for education standards commonly known as Common Core, as well as his support for an overhaul of immigration policy.\n\nHe reiterated that he supports Common Core but opposes the Obama administration\u2019s decision to tie federal funding incentives to the standards, saying, \u201cThat is not the job of the federal government.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor states that don\u2019t want to be part of Common Core because it\u2019s poisonous politically and people are tired of explaining it \u2014 fine \u2014 create your own higher standards,\u201d he told the crowd.\n\nHe was also lectured by a conservative, who warned that \u201cyou\u2019re going to have a tough sell\u201d on immigration reform.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s my job,\u201d he told the man. \u201cMy job is to not back down on my beliefs.\u201d\n\nBush served as Florida governor from 1999 to 2007 and left office just weeks before Obama formally launched his presidential campaign. In recent years, while a new crop of Republicans were elected with tea party support \u2014 including presidential contenders Sens. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), Rand Paul (R-Ky.) and Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) \u2014 Bush was running a foundation promoting education reforms and building his personal wealth as an investment manager in Miami.\n\n[Rather than run from his brother\u2019s foreign policy, Jeb Bush embraces it]\n\nBush sat out the 2012 presidential campaign even though many Republicans urged him to run. In a June 2012 interview with PBS\u2019s Charlie Rose, he lamented the \u201carmed camps\u201d that had gripped political Washington \u2014 and struck a tone similar to the one he\u2019s adopted on the campaign trail this year.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have to play the game of being 100,000 percent against President Obama,\u201d he said at the time. \u201cI\u2019ve got a long list of things that I think he\u2019s done wrong and with civility and respect I will point those out if I\u2019m asked. But on the things I think he\u2019s done a good job on, I\u2019m not just going to say no.\u201d\n\nIn the same interview, Bush alleged Obama was repeatedly blaming his brother for his own missteps and suggested it would be nice to hear Obama give \u201cjust a small acknowledgment that the guy you replaced isn\u2019t the source of any problem and the excuse of why you\u2019re not being successful.\u201d\n\nWhile some conservatives dismiss Bush\u2019s pleas for comity, others embrace them. Fergus Cullen hosted a house party for Bush in New Hampshire in March and said he did so because \u201che\u2019s going to up the level of dialogue for himself and other candidates.\u201d\n\n\u201cI appreciate the tone that he has offered in the last couple of months,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the party needs a lot more of that this cycle.\u201d\n\nEven Erickson hasn\u2019t given up on Bush \u2014 at least not yet.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d gladly support him if he were the nominee. His record as governor of Florida was impressively conservative,\u201d he said. \u201cHis tone of late, however, has noticeably drifted left.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The former Florida governor has angered conservatives by siding with president on some issues.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ed-OKeefe/147995121918931", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The former Florida governor has angered conservatives by siding with president on some issues.", "title": "Can Jeb Bush win the GOP nomination .\u2009.\u2009. by praising President Obama?", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/can-jeb-bush-win-the-gop-nomination-by-praising--president-obama/2015/04/24/e84c9678-e93c-11e4-9a6a-c1ab95a0600b_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/04/17/Others/Images/2015-04-17/Botsford_na-jeb_15_04_17_05831429289893.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@edatpost"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/can-jeb-bush-win-the-gop-nomination-by-praising--president-obama/2015/04/24/e84c9678-e93c-11e4-9a6a-c1ab95a0600b_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Jeb Bush, Jeb Bush and President Obama, Obama Jeb Bush, Jeb Bush Keystone XL, keystone xl, affordable care act, congressional republicans, national security agency, loretta lynch, Bush NSA, Marco Rubio, Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, Fergus Cullen, Erick Erickson, David Bozell, Mark Meckler, Tea Party Patriots, For America, Citizens of Self-Governance", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ed-OKeefe/147995121918931"}, "news_keywords": "Jeb Bush, Jeb Bush and President Obama, Obama Jeb Bush, Jeb Bush Keystone XL, keystone xl, affordable care act, congressional republicans, national security agency, loretta lynch, Bush NSA, Marco Rubio, Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, Fergus Cullen, Erick Erickson, David Bozell, Mark Meckler, Tea Party Patriots, For America, Citizens of Self-Governance", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "eomportal-uuid": "e84c9678-e93c-11e4-9a6a-c1ab95a0600b"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0262\"", "article_summary": "Jeb Bush leaves after speaking at a Republican Leadership Summit in Nashua, N.H., on April 17, 2015.\n\u201cI don\u2019t have to play the game of being 100,000 percent against President Obama,\u201d he said at the time.\nJeb Bush speaks to reporters as he leaves an event in New York on Thursday.\n[In drive to be 45th president, Jeb Bush faces legacies of the 41st and 43rd]But Bush is sticking to his support for education and immigration reforms \u2014 positions unpopular with many GOP voters.\nIt\u2019s an unusual approach for Bush in seeking the nomination of a conservative party that mostly loathes the current president."}
