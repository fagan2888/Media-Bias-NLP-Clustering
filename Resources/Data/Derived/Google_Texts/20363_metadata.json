Well over half of that amount, $33.1 billion, would be gobbled up by the development and manufacture of the Air Force\u2019s new strategic platform, the Long-Range Strike Bomber.\n\nRelated: 9 ISIS Weapons That Will Shock You\n\nThe other $24.4 billion would go toward upgrading the aging Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit and the Boeing B-52 Stratofortress.\n\nThe GAO price tag, based on figures made available in May, is a stunning $18 billion higher than the $40 billon sticker price the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office gave the effort in January.\n\nIt also indicates that few people, including Air Force and Defense Department leaders, know the true cost of the highly-classified program.\n\nThe Air Force has estimated it would cost $55 billion to build as many as 100 Long Range Strike Bombers, or around $550 million each.\n\nRelated: 7 New Weapons in Vladimir Putin's Arsenal\n\nThose figures are likely to rise, though, given the service\u2019s track record for keeping big ticket items on track and under budget.\n\nThe price of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program, for example, swelled to $400 billion, making it the single most expensive weapons project in U.S. history. Already several years behind schedule, its costs ballooned by roughly 70 percent, even after the Pentagon scaled back the number of planes it intends to purchase by more than 400, to roughly 2,440.\n\nThe bomber program itself isn\u2019t off to a great start. The Air Force is expected to announce a contract decision sometime in September, a slip from a previous timetable of a June or July announcement.\n\nRelated: $55 to $75 Billion--Guess How Much the New Stealth Bomber Will Cost\n\nNorthrop Grumman and a Boeing-Lockheed Martin joint venture are competing for the highly-lucrative contract that defense observers say could upend the industry.\n\nThe GAO study shows that the total estimated cost of sustaining and modernizing the nuclear force rose 40 percent in 2014 when compared to the 2013 projections, in large part because the new amount includes the Long-Range Strike Bomber and the Air Force\u2019s replacement for the Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile, dubbed the Ground-Based Strategic Deterrent.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The contract for the Pentagon\u2019s next generation strategic bomber hasn\u2019t even been awarded yet, but federal auditors already predict the effort will be a budgetary whopper.", "title": "The Pentagon\u2019s Next-Generation Budget Busting Bomber", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/08/04/Pentagon-s-Next-Generation-Budget-Busting-Bomber", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/08042015_B2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/08/04/Pentagon-s-Next-Generation-Budget-Busting-Bomber", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/08042015_B2.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The contract for the Pentagon\u2019s next generation strategic bomber hasn\u2019t even been awarded yet, but federal auditors already predict the effort will be a budgetary whopper.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb87c\"", "article_summary": "The contract for the Pentagon\u2019s next generation strategic bomber hasn\u2019t been awarded yet, but federal auditors already predict the effort will be a budgetary whopper.\nThe Air Force is expected to announce a contract decision sometime in September, a slip from a previous timetable of a June or July announcement.\nIt also indicates that few people, including Air Force and Defense Department leaders, know the true cost of the highly-classified program.\nWell over half of that amount, $33.1 billion, would be gobbled up by the development and manufacture of the Air Force\u2019s new strategic platform, the Long-Range Strike Bomber.\nA July 30 report by the Government Accountability Office found the U.S. is on pace to spend roughly $58 billion on its bomber fleet over the next decade."}
