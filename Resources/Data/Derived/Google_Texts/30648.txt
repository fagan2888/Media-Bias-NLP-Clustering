MADISON COUNTY, Ala. (WHNT) - The Huntsville/Madison County Convention and Visitors Bureau (CVB) just received big news.

"Actually amazing news when you think about it," explained Bob Rogers, the CVBN vice president of conventions. "We're at a billion dollars in economic impact in just the tourism business."

Which means the average Madison County taxpayer will pay $600 less for their yearly taxes due to the dollars that came in from visitors during 2014.

Rogers went on to say that conventions, groups, and individual travelers are accounted for in the numbers provided by the Alabama Tourism Department, and with recent conventions that have already come through town, 2015 just might top that -- especially with a specific event returning to the Rocket City.

"We have the Goldwing [motorcycle] Riders, which is a convention we had in the 90s, we filled every hotel room then," he said.

The numbers released tourism boosts for all of the state's county. Madison came in third, behind Baldwin and Jefferson counties.
