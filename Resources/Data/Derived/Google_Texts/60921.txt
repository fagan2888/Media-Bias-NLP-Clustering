A Norway spruce nearly 80-feet tall will serve as this year’s Rockefeller Center Christmas tree.

It’s the second tree in the past six years from Shelton, Conn. Workers cut it down, placed it on a tractor-trailer and hauled it 70 miles to New York City. It’s expected to go up Friday morning.

The tree-lighting ceremony is scheduled for Dec. 4. The tree will remain on display until Jan. 7.
