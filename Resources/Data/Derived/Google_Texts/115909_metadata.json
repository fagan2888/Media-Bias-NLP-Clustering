That\u2019s because the request \u201cwill continue to focus on new spending proposals\u201d instead of tackling \u201cour $19 trillion in debt,\u201d Senate Budget Committee Chairman Mike Enzi (R-Wyo.) said last week. Complete details on proposed total spending, projected deficits and other information will be released Tuesday morning.\n\nGiven Congress\u2019 sight-unseen dismissal, the president\u2019s go-for-broke strategy makes sense, said Peter Orszag, who was White House budget director during Obama\u2019s first term and director of the Congressional Budget Office before that.\n\n\u201cIf the document is legislatively irrelevant,\u201d Orszag said, \u201cyou might as well use it to expand the policy dialogue and lay out sensible proposals even if they will not become law this year or next.\u201d This year\u2019s budget proposal \u201clays the groundwork for Democrats to refine and embrace a more ambitious legislative agenda over time.\u201d\n\nLame-duck presidential budget requests nearly always receive catcalls from Congress, especially when it\u2019s controlled by the opposite party.\n\nIn February 2008, then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi scored President George W. Bush\u2019s \u201cmisguided\u201d final budget for cuts in health care and energy assistance and a too-large budget deficit. The final product was a mashup from Congress, the outgoing Bush administration and the incoming Obama administration. It yielded a $1.4 trillion deficit \u2014 the largest in U.S. history, in large part because of the financial crisis. The current deficit is an estimated $544 billion.\n\nPresident Bill Clinton\u2019s final budget, submitted in February 2000, was less contentious, in part because it adhered to a 1997 agreement with the Republican-controlled Congress on debt reduction. Clinton had the opposite problem: His budget\u2019s spending levels were judged too high, and its budget surplus \u2014 which ended up being $1.3 billion \u2014 drew sharp criticism from Republicans, including candidate Bush, who wanted to return it to the public in the form of tax cuts. The novel problem of a budget surplus proved short-lived; it vanished the following year, and hasn\u2019t been heard from since.\n\nWhere Obama\u2019s lame-duck policy agenda differs, suggests presidential historian Michael Beschloss, is in the scope of its ambition. \u201cModern presidents have tended to focus on a particular project\u201d in their last year, Beschloss said \u2014 \u201cfor instance, Eisenhower and Reagan trying to wind down the Cold War, or Johnson trying to find peace in Vietnam.\u201d But Obama is different. He\u2019s \u201clooking for ways in his final year to pursue an agenda on many fronts\u201d in hopes not only of \u201cgetting something done\u201d but also \u201cnudging his successor to do certain things.\u201d\n\nIt is the policy, perhaps, of a departing president who \u2014 given this year\u2019s unusually chaotic GOP primary race \u2014 feels more confident than most that his party will keep the White House.\n\nThe boldest of all the budget proposals is the $10-a-barrel crude oil tax. Energy taxes are always a hard sell \u2014 nobody's raised the federal gasoline tax, for instance, since 1993 \u2014 and although consumers may be less resistant because of low pump prices, oil companies will be more so because falling gas prices have them reducing exploration and laying off workers.\n\nThe revenues would go not toward deficit reduction, but toward more green forms of transportation such as subways, buses and light rail. House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady immediately denounced the plan as a \"horrible idea\" and a \"waste of time,\" and even some congressional Democrats will likely oppose it. But environmentalists are greeting it as an overdue down payment on reducing emissions that contribute to climate change. Sierra Club Executive Director Michael Brune said it \"underscores the inevitable transition away from oil.\"\n\nThe president's proposed Medicaid expansion would extend the Affordable Care Act's promise of three years' full federal funding for ACA-created Medicaid coverage, which expires this year. The proposal is an inducement to the 19 states that continue not to participate in the program, which was created for families whose incomes were too low to qualify for federal subsidies to purchase private insurance plans through Obamacare exchanges.\n\nUnder the budget proposal, states would still get only three years' full federal funding, after which they would gradually have to pick up 10 percent of program costs. The carrot is that they would no longer have to act by the end of 2016. A stick originally envisioned by the ACA's authors \u2014 that states could not refuse the ACA Medicaid expansion without withdrawing from Medicaid entirely \u2014 was itself swatted away in the Supreme Court's 2012 ruling that otherwise upheld Obamacare. The new extension is a rebuke of sorts to House Republicans who have voted repeatedly to repeal Obamacare and who last month sent to the White House a repeal bill that for the first time passed both the House and Senate \u2014 which the president promptly vetoed.\n\nThe budget's new K-12 computer science program isn't intrinsically partisan \u2014 both Democrats and Republicans favor enhancing school kids' computer skills, not to mention big tech companies like Microsoft. But its $4 billion price tag raises GOP hackles, as does the notion of attaching more strings to federal aid to schools. \"Rather than calling for additional federal programs or new funding streams,\" an aide to Health Education Labor and Pensions Committee Chairman Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) complained, \"the president can help students by using his bully pulpit to highlight states working in innovative ways to help their children succeed.\"\n\nThe \"cancer moon shot\" is similarly uncontroversial in theory; after all, it was President Richard Nixon, a Republican, who proposed waging a federal \"war on cancer\" back in 1971. But the down payment of nearly $1 billion that the White House seeks is high, and congressional Republicans won't like that the plan would largely bypass the appropriations process and give Vice President Joe Biden a relatively free hand in allocating some of the funds. In addition, the plan would compel medical researchers to quicken the pace at which they share data, an idea that is already receiving considerable pushback in academia. Jeffrey Dazen, editor of the esteemed New England Journal of Medicine, publicly decried the use of medical research by \"data parasites.\"\n\nThe likelihood of legislative action on any of these agenda items is virtually nil.\n\nStill, observes Rutgers historian David Greenberg, author of a new book about presidential spin: \"No one wants to admit that the last year will be an uneventful one.\"\n\nPOLITICO staff contributed to this report.\n\nAuthors:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "Congress has already dismissed the proposal, sight unseen.", "title": "Obama\u2019s go-for-broke budget", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2016/02/obamas-radical-final-budget-218944", "image": "http://static.politico.com/c5/2b/eab81a824cb8b81477676872916d/20160208-barack-obama-1-ap-1160.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/timothy.noah"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "Congress has already dismissed the proposal, sight unseen.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "In February 2008, then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi scored President George W.
