These are all extreme stressors that can lead someone toward depression, and definitely shorten their lives. But when it comes to old age, it\u2019s the smaller things that will get you, according to a new study published in the journal Experimental Gerontology.\n\nEvery day we\u2019re faced with small stressors that can either make or break our day. Delayed train rides, spilt coffee on a white shirt, or a broken heel are just some examples. When these things happen, we have the choice of either moving on (\u201cnothing\u2019s bringing my happiness down!\u201d) or letting it affect our mood for the rest of the day.\n\nThe new study, led by Carolyn Aldwin, director of the Center for Healthy Aging Research at Oregon State University, found that older men who did the latter were more likely to die earlier. Stress causes a bunch of harmful, and sometimes unconscious effects in our body, from anger and crying to stomach problems, increased heart rate, and substance abuse.\n\nFor Aldwin\u2019s study, her team looked at data from the Veteran\u2019s Affairs Normative Aging Study, examining not only stressful life events among 1,293 men who participated between 1989 and 2005, but also the smaller everyday hassles they encountered. After following these men until 2010, and adjusting for age and health conditions, they found that only about 29 percent of those who could smile through their problems had died. Meanwhile, 64 percent of men who cried over the smaller things died.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the number of hassles that does you in, it\u2019s the perception of them being a big deal that causes problems,\u201d Aldwin said in a press release. \u201cTaking things in stride may protect you.\u201d\n\nIt all comes down to how you cope with stress, a difficult thing to do when that\u2019s all that consumes your mind. There are ways to cope healthily, however, such as exercising, committing to a healthier diet, listening to music, and getting outdoors (preferably into a park or the woods). Of course, getting used to a routine with these habits takes time, but that\u2019s OK because stress\u2019s effect on the body does, too.\n\nWith dedication and self-awareness, the mind can overcome any setback, and put you on the path to a longer life.\n\nSource: Alswin C, jeong Y-J, Igarashi H, Choun S, Ill AS.
