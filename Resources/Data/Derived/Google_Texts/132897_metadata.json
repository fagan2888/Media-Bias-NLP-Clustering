Radio talk show hosts, national news publications, and paid off political pundits from \u201cA\u201d to \u201cZ\u201d are busy speculating on who their next \u201cshock and awe\u201d candidate will be during the fast approaching 2016 presidential election. Inquisitr has already given us a nice election 2016 preview of who the \u201cgood ole\u2019 boys\u201d are most likely placing their bets on.\n\nThe Washington Post did a great job informing us recently about how giddy the Republican establishment has gotten about the (very remote) prospects of resurrecting Mitt Romney for a 2016 presidential run. Really? The same Mitt Romney that got trounced by Barack Obama just a few short years ago? I watched the debates, and honestly, I found the real differences between Romney and Obama to be barely palpable.\n\nNext up on the Republican side for likely 2016 prospects would likely be Jeb Bush (oh please\u2026 let the dynasty continue), Chris Christie (George Washington Bridge scandal anyone?), Paul Ryan (of formerly defeated Romney fame), Marco \u201cpro-immigration reform and potential repeat of the Eric Cantor defeat\u201d Rubio, and then there is the \u201cboogeyman\u201d standing in the back of the room that few establishment politicians are willing to talk about (no not Ted Cruz; but no doubt if your guess was Cruz you wouldn\u2019t be wrong). There is a slightly more palatable candidate in the establishment\u2019s view that would serve to attract a large amount of Tea Party support and who would likely re-invigorate the younger, more libertarian leaning segment of the Republican Party in the 2016 election \u2014 that candidate being Rand Paul. Oh you didn\u2019t just say Rand Paul did you? Yes I did. No doubt the establishment will kick him to the curb when the time comes (if they can).\n\nI\u2019ve got one big message for the Republican establishment prior to election 2016: Hey, what just happened to Eric Cantor? What just happened to your boy in the house who was going to make \u201cimmigration reform\u201d a reality? I would follow that question up with, based on the same logic, how popular is Marco Rubio (hint: he trails Hillary in FL right now)? Sure, his district may be more accepting of his position on immigration reform, but what about the nation as a whole? Even the wildly unpopular \u201cAffordable Care Act\u201d passed into law before immigration reform. And it\u2019s not even that the American people are against reforming the clearly outdated immigration system. In fact, NBC News tells us that a whopping 78 percent of Republican primary voters support a step-by-step approach to enacting real immigration reform.\n\nWhat the voters don\u2019t support is a man-made child refugee crisis on our southern border, a descent into lawlessness on the part of the establishment by not enforcing existing laws, and a corporate agenda to grant some form of amnesty to millions of \u201cnewly arrived workers\u201d who will then replace the American blue collar workers at much lower wages.\n\nBy speaking in terms of this one controversial issue, we, the American public, can truthfully come to terms with what\u2019s really going on here prior to the 2016 election. That is simply this: The establishment wants what it wants and it will do what it wants until voters in both parties become upset enough with the status quo and decide to enact real change. In regards to the establishment push for \u201cimmigration reform,\u201d the left gets millions of new potential voters and the right gets cost effective labor which will help \u201ccushion\u201d the corporate costs of complying with the \u201cAffordable Care Act.\u201d And it\u2019s like this on nearly every issue! Who really wins here? The \u201ctwo-headed\u201d establishment or the American people?\n\nOn the left in 2016: your choices look to be between Joe \u201cthe walking gaffe\u201d Biden and Hillary \u201cWhat difference does it make?\u201d Clinton. Wow, how exciting! With choices like that I\u2019m sure most Democrats will be lining up at the doors to enthusiastically make sure their ballots get cast in time (sarcasm, yes). If it\u2019s any indication of election 2016 excitement on the left, the 10 Day Green Smoothie Cleanse book is outselling Hillary\u2019s Hard Choices right now on Amazon. I can\u2019t resist this one\u2026 when we\u2019re talking about election 2016 candidates, the title of Hillary\u2019s book is nearly prophetic. Hard Choices is right on the money!\n\nBarring the entry of a third-party or non-establishment, hand-picked candidate from either party, the 2016 presidential election is looking to be a lot more of the same.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Incoming, US presidential election 2016!
