In Spokane County, cancer of all kinds kills more people than any other cause. Heart disease and chronic lower respiratory disease, both with clear links to smoking, are next.\n\nBut efforts to suppress tobacco use have found stubborn enemies in the combined forces of peer pressure and nicotine addiction. The poor and less-educated are especially vulnerable. Yet they can least afford an $8-plus pack of cigarettes, let alone the medical treatment many will need when the cumulative cost of all that puffing or snuffing comes due.\n\nSome of the expense is borne by employers. Smoking may add $763 to the annual medical bills of a smoker compared with a nonsmoker. Smokers are 60 percent more likely to be absent.\n\nFor landlords, cleaning up a smoker\u2019s apartment may be $3,000 more expensive than cleaning that of a nonsmoker. Other tenants pick up the tab by paying higher rents.\n\nYet only 60 percent of apartment units in Spokane were nonsmoking in 2011, even though 74 percent of tenants say that is their housing preference.\n\nSo, last month the Spokane Regional Health District released two toolkits intended to help employers and landlords develop policies that will create smoke-free environments.\n\nFirst, they have to determine how tobacco-free they want to be, up to eliminating tobacco from their premises entirely, setting aside smoking areas, or not hiring or leasing to smokers.\n\nStakeholders \u2212 managers, workers, bargaining units, tenants \u2212 should be brought into the process early. Communication is important throughout the process. At implementation, the expectations for compliance must be understood; the ramifications of noncompliance, too.\n\nFor employers, there are sample policies from the district itself, Johnson & Johnson and the Washington State University Spokane campus. For landlords, the district provides a smoke-free lease addendum.\n\nBoth toolkits include two pages of mostly free resources for those who want to quit.\n\nAlso, buried in the Affordable Care Act are provisions that provide for the payment of smoking-cessation services under Medicaid. After Massachusetts included smoking cessation in its Medicaid plans, tobacco use among those clients fell from 38 percent to 28 percent.\n\nHealth district officials say they developed the toolkits because businesses were asking for help. Both can be found among the featured topics on its website: www.srhd.org.\n\nThey should be valuable to businesses that choose to use them, and the public whose health will be better protected if they are widely adopted.\n\nTo respond to this editorial online, go to www.spokesman.com and click on opinion under the Topics menu.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Spokesman.com", "description": "No-smoking policies benefit businesses, community", "title": "Editorial: More no-smoking policies would benefit businesses, community", "url": "http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2015/oct/07/more-no-smoking-policies-would-benefit-businesses-/", "image": "http://media.spokesman.com/img/logos/sr200.png", "updated_time": "2015-10-07T06:46:54.591983", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@SpokesmanReview", "card": "summary"}, "description": "No-smoking policies benefit businesses, community", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes", "fb": {"app_id": 316254480466}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc348\"", "article_summary": "Stakeholders \u2212 managers, workers, bargaining units, tenants \u2212 should be brought into the process early.\nSo, last month the Spokane Regional Health District released two toolkits intended to help employers and landlords develop policies that will create smoke-free environments.\nFor employers, there are sample policies from the district itself, Johnson & Johnson and the Washington State University Spokane campus.\nTo respond to this editorial online, go to www.spokesman.com and click on opinion under the Topics menu.\nBut efforts to suppress tobacco use have found stubborn enemies in the combined forces of peer pressure and nicotine addiction."}
