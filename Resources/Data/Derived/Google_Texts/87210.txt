Nearly 300 people took part in a memorial Sunday for the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.

Firefighters from across New Hampshire and neighboring states climbed 110 flights of stairs at the Brady Sullivan Tower in Manchester.

Sen. Kelly Ayotte and U.S. Senate hopeful Scott Brown joined the firefighters.

The Twin Towers in New York had exactly 110 flights of stairs, so firefighters, friends and family climbed to the top of the Brady Sullivan Tower five times and then an additional 10 flights.

“It doesn’t matter if it’s 100 years, this day is forever in history, and we can never forget the sacrifice that the guys made. This is the least we can do,” said Capt. Tom Sabourn of the Woodstock Fire Department.

Participants also rang a bell in honor of the 343 firefighters killed in the 9/11 attacks.

Money raised from the event will go to the national Fallen Firefighters Memorial.
