AdvancePierre Foods Makes Another Acquisition, Adds Stuffed Sandwiches

The company is buying the assets of Better Bakery, following a January deal for Landshire's manufacturing operations

AdvancePierre Foods is building up its sandwich business with the acquisition of Better Bakery LLC, following a purchase in January.

Better Bakery, headquartered in Valencia, California, manufactures stuffed sandwiches, including melts stuffed inside pretzels. The group's production will be moved to AdvancePierre's Caseyville, Illinois, facility. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.

Cincinnati-based AdvancePierre bought Landshire Inc.'s manufacturing operations, including the Caseyville facility, in January. Landshire makes more than 80 different prepared food products, including various sandwiches.

AdvancePierre markets meat and protein products, including fully-cooked beef, chicken and pork products, as well as uncooked meat items and bakery products.

We've seen dozens of food and beverages deals recently, many of which have been spurred by consumer interest in better-for-you products. Recent transactions in that space include Centre Partners' majority investment in Sun Orchard Inc., and Advent International's acquisition of Noosa Yoghurt LLC.
