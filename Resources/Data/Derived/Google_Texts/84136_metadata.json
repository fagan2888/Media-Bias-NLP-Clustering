Paul Ryan (R-WI) came from BuzzFeed, you\u2019d be inclined to think that the former vice presidential candidate has made a major shift in policy to start focusing on poverty in the United States. You would be wrong.\n\nOn Friday, BuzzFeed ran a glowing profile of Ryan, entitled \u201cPaul Ryan Finds God,\u201d that portrayed him as a man who was inspired by religion and the ascendancy of a new pope to become a caretaker for the nation\u2019s poor. But the piece, similar to another article that ran in the Washington Post last month, offered up no substance to show that Ryan\u2019s policies have changed or that his religious outlook is any different than it was during the 2012 campaign. Rather, it relied on quotes from Paul Ryan\u2019s own supporters \u2014 former campaign staffers and members of President George W. Bush\u2019s cabinet \u2014 to demonstrate that Ryan has shifted his focus.\n\nMedia reports have long treated Ryan as a straight-talker willing to speak bluntly even to his political detriment. BuzzFeed\u2019s piece \u2014 which characterizes Ryan as someone sneaking around to serve the poor via covert speeches and donations of neckties to schoolchildren \u2014 was no exception. Focusing extensively on Ryan\u2019s new effort to cast himself as a poverty crusader with a new anti-poverty plan whose details are not yet known, the article gave a brief nod to the \u201cskeptics\u201d who believe these showings are a \u201csavvy move in a self-interested rebranding effort,\u201d then promptly summarized the speeches and tie-sendings as part of Ryan\u2019s effort to \u201clead the restoration of compassionate conservatism with a heartfelt mission to the poor.\u201d\n\nOne of the reasons Ryan has apparently had a \u201cspiritual epiphany\u201d to care about the poor, as the BuzzFeed piece tells it, is because of the new pope, Francis. The piece quotes several Republicans who say Ryan is inspired by the church and by Francis. But Ryan\u2019s on the record quotes about the pope \u2014 who has vocally denounced the idea of trickle-down economics that Ryan and the GOP endorse as \u201ca crude and na\u00efve trust in the goodness of those wielding economic power\u201d \u2014 tell a different story. Ryan subtly disparaged the pope earlier this year, saying that he doesn\u2019t understand real capitalism because, \u201cThe guy is from Argentina, they haven\u2019t had real capitalism in Argentina\u2026 They have crony capitalism in Argentina. They don\u2019t have a true free enterprise system.\u201d\n\nOn top of that, Ryan has alienated many in the church through his draconian budget cuts. During the 2012 campaign, Catholic nuns tore into the Congressman for proposing a plan that severely punished the country\u2019s poor. A group of nuns even followed Ryan\u2019s campaign in a bus, protesting his \u201cirresponsible,\u201d \u201cdevastating,\u201d \u201cimmoral and unjustifiable\u201d budget that puts a \u201cburden on the poor.\u201d Ryan\u2019s efforts to gut the food stamps program have also elicited the scorn of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, who called the cuts \u201cunjustified and wrong.\u201d\n\nBut in the lead-up to the next election year, Ryan is trying to change his reputation. Last month, he indicated that he would be offering up an anti-poverty plan similar to his past budget plans. Yet those previous plans have actually served to extensively cut social safety net programs for the poor \u2014 programs that have kept tens of millions out of poverty. Opposition to these programs is not a phase Ryan has moved past; in the latest budget deal negotiated by Ryan and Sen. Patty Murray (D-WA), one major thing he won for Republicans was excluding a reauthorization of long-term unemployment benefits.\n\nRyan also still continues to push for the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, a law designed with a specific program to help the poor gain access to health care. The Medicaid expansion in the law lets people within 150 percent of the federal poverty line get affordable health care. But Ryan has egged on Republicans who want to opt out of that program in their states and has continued to push for repeal and replacement of the law. In Ryan\u2019s ideal world, Medicaid would be delivered to the states in block grants, which would effectively destroy the program by allowing states to reallocate that cash.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Ryan has tried to square conservative anti-safety net doctrine with the church\u2019s teachings about poverty. But previous attempts, both for Ryan and for the GOP, haven\u2019t gone very well. The Congressman leans on the principle of \u201csubsidiarity\u201d \u2014 a fancy word for removing government from anti-poverty work and leaving the matter to local groups \u2014 to justify his desired cuts. But those local groups are quite vocal about being unable to handle the sheer quantity of demand for their services. Local anti-poverty groups say they need more federal help, not less.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Is Paul Ryan really making a policy shift, or is BuzzFeed falling for his rebranding tricks?", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "Is Paul Ryan really making a policy shift, or is BuzzFeed falling for his rebranding tricks?", "title": "BuzzFeed Declares Paul Ryan A \u2018Champion Of The Poor,\u2019 Offers No Supporting Evidence", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/economy/2013/12/20/3094291/buzzfeed-paul-ryan-god/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Paul_ryan_thumbs_up-e1381676569504.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Is Paul Ryan really making a policy shift, or is BuzzFeed falling for his rebranding tricks?", "title": "BuzzFeed Declares Paul Ryan A \u2018Champion Of The Poor,\u2019 Offers No Supporting Evidence", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Paul_ryan_thumbs_up-e1381676569504-321x214.jpg", "creator": "@ARStrasser", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-economy", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Paul_ryan_thumbs_up-e1381676569504.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Paul_ryan_thumbs_up-e1381676569504.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2013-12-20T11:13:15+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/PykeA"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcedaa\"", "article_summary": "Economy BuzzFeed Declares Paul Ryan A \u2018Champion Of The Poor,\u2019 Offers No Supporting Evidence CREDIT:CREDIT: APIf your only recent impressions of Rep.
