That\u2019s a tough question to answer, given that projected increases are substantial in some states and moderate in other states.\n\nThe answer to this question is an important one for clinical laboratory executives and pathologists. If health insurers pay out more in claims than they receive in premiums, they generally try to balance the books by paying providers less. That includes medical laboratories.\n\nThere is credible evidence that premiums in some states may increase dramatically for 2016. Even as the Obama administration pressures states to keep rates from rising too fast, many insurers are struggling to remain financially viable after discovering that those enrolling in the Obamacare marketplace continue to be less healthy than anticipated.\n\nOne consequence from health insurers that face mounting financial pressures is that they could be inclined to exclude higher-priced clinical laboratories and pathology groups from their networks. Also, as noted earlier, they could reduce the amount they reimburse for lab tests.\n\nIn Some States, Health Insurance Rate Increases May Be as High as 50%\n\nInsurers\u2019 rate increase proposals made headlines this spring when some state exchanges announced they were receiving requests for premium hikes as high as 50%. In New Mexico, market leader Health Care Service Corp. asked for an average increase of 51.6%, while Tennessee\u2019s biggest insurer, BlueCross BlueShield, requested a 36.3% boost.\n\nBecause state insurance commissions must review\u2014and can potentially reject\u2014proposals to increase premiums by more than 10%, the Obama administration has asked state regulators to scrutinize rate requests.\n\nKevin Counihan, Director & Marketplace Chief Executive Officer, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, sent a letter to state insurance commissioners in July outlining reasons for supporting only moderate increases in premium costs.\n\nMixed Success in Attempts to Control Health Premium Increases for 2016\n\nThus far, efforts to rein-in rate increases for 2016 have been mixed. Oregon, which was the first state to announce final rates, will see premiums increase by an average of 24%, slightly above what insurers had requested. Oregon\u2019s Insurance Commissioner determined that some of the rates filed were too low and would not meet projected claim costs, Healthinsurance.org reported.\n\nCalifornia, meanwhile, announced a modest 4% rate increase in rates for its individual healthcare marketplace, Covered California. This would be a slight decrease from 2015\u2019s 4.2% premium rise.\n\n\u201cWe have Chicken Littles who keep saying the sky is falling tomorrow,\u201d Peter Lee, Executive Director of Covered California, told the Los Angeles Times. \u201cWe are proving competition drives prices down.\u201d\n\nUnlike most other states, California actively negotiates with insurers over rates and does not automatically allow every company to sell in its marketplace. Lee told the Los Angeles Times that the state\u2019s negotiations lowered premiums by about $200 million compared with what the plans originally sought.\n\nPressures on Payers to Keep Premiums Low \u201cUnrealistic\u201d\n\nYet not everyone believes arm-twisting insurers to keep rates low is good for the long-term health of the exchanges.\n\nKim Holland, Vice President, State Affairs, BlueCross BlueShield Association stated that there are \u201cunrealistic pressures\u201d on insurers to keep premiums low.\n\n\u201cYou cannot have every doctor in your network, very low copays, broad benefits, and lower costs. It just can\u2019t work that way,\u201d declared Holland in an article published on Bloomberg BNA.\n\nAll told, more than 450 insurers are requesting rate increases of 10% or more for 2016. This is a steep increase from the 151 insurers who pursued double-digit increases in 2015, according to research by the National Center for Public Policy Research, a Washington, D.C.-based conservative think-tank.\n\n\u201cThis year, health plans have a full year of claims data to understand the health needs of the exchange population, and these enrollees are generally older and often managing multiple chronic conditions,\u201d observed Clare Krusing, Director of Communications, America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, in a story published by the Wall Street Journal. \u201cPremiums reflect the rising costs of providing care to individuals and families, and the explosion in prescription and specialty drug prices is a significant factor.\u201d\n\n2017 Rate Hikes for Health Insurance Premiums Could Be Even Higher\n\nSome healthcare experts predict that this first round of double-digit premium increases may be only a prelude to what lies ahead in future years\n\n\u201cThe increases for 2016 will impact consumer behavior,\u201d David Hogberg, Ph.D., Health Care Policy Analyst for the National Center for Public Policy Research said in a news release. \u201cSome of the healthiest people facing these hikes will probably flee to cheaper insurers. That will leave [those] insurers with big rate hikes in 2016 with an even older and sicker risk pool, forcing them to hike rates even more for 2017.\u201d\n\nNow that insurers are no longer able to deny coverage or charge higher premiums based on pre-existing conditions, on January 1, 2017, insurers also will face the sunseting of two of three provisions in the ACA that promoted market stability: risk corridors and reinsurance. Only risk adjustment is a permanent part of the ACA.\n\nIn a guest post published in Forbes, Robert Laszewski, President of Health Policy and Strategy Associates LLC, a policy consulting firm based in Washington, D.C., predicted that the \u201creal Obamacare rates\u201d will be revealed in mid-2016 when the 2017 prices are published.\n\n\u201cBy then health plans will finally have had a couple of years of credible claim data and two of the \u20183Rs\u2019 subsidizing the insurance companies will have gone away,\u201d he wrote.\n\nCould Rate Increases Hit Double Digit Levels for 2016 and 2017?\n\nIf it proves true that there are double digit increases in health premiums in many states for both 2016 and 2017, it will probably not be auspicious for the clinical laboratory industry. That\u2019s because, historically, when medical claims exceed projections, health insurers attempt to recoup those losses by forcing price cuts on hospitals, physicians, and medical laboratories.\n\n\u2014Andrea Downing Peck\n\nRelated Information:\n\nOuch!
