In fact, DOH records say Ganuza was served with the complaint but never responded to it. Prosecutors said that means he waives his right to a defense.\n\nHealth News Florida phoned Ganuza's clinic on Friday afternoon after the board quickly and unanimously revoked his license. His assistant said that while Ganuza was there, he was in a meeting and couldn't come to the phone.\n\nBy contrast, Yankopolus came to Friday's meeting of the Board of Medicine in Deerfield Beach with an attorney and armed with letters from colleagues and friends attesting to his skill as a doctor, in the past as an OB-GYN and more recently in primary care.\n\nDr. Ronald Gardner, a Fort Myers orthopedist, wrote that he has known \"Konnie\" Yankopolus for 24 years, working with him both as a colleague and on charitable projects. His medical treatment is good and his patients love him, Gardner said.\n\nPrimary care physician Alan Tannenbaum said he has known Yankopolus 19 years as a colleague at Cape Coral and Southwest Florida Regional hospitals and said he had no issues with his care.\n\n\"I believe Dr. Yankopolus has a caring heart and still can be a provider of quality care to the people of Florida,\" Tannenbaum wrote.\n\nThe DOH charged Yankopolus with nine counts of wrongdoing. Eight of them concerned practicing below the standard of care for four patients, and failing to keep good medical records in those cases. The ninth count involved breaking an emergency restriction on his license that DOH issued in 2012 barring him from being involved in unapproved stem-cell treatments or referring patients for that purpose.\n\nThe order was issued after Yankopolus became involved in a notorious case, assisting Dr. Zannos Grekos of Bonita Springs in an unapproved stem-cell treatment in which the patient died. Yankopolus had an opportunity to settle that case with a fine and probation, as the Naples Daily News reported at the time, but rejected it.\n\nThe DOH said Yankopolus referred a patient for the stem-cell procedure shortly after the order was issued, thereby violating it.\n\nAs for the prescribing counts, an investigative report said Yankopolus was serving as the physician for Renaissance Wellness, a licensed pain clinic in Fort Myers, in December 2012 when it failed a routine inspection. It failed the follow-up inspection in February 2013, DOH said.\n\nBoard members said the pattern of prescribing at the clinic looked like a classic pill mill, but Yankopolus denied that. \"I did no harm to any patients,\" he said.\n\nDr. George Thomas, medical board member, said the letters supporting Yankopolus were nice, but the reality wasn't pretty. \"This is the most egregious case I have seen,\" he said.\n\n--Health News Florida is part of WUSF Public Media.
