Booting the longest field goal in NFL history has help netted Denver Broncos’ Matt Prater the top rating among kickers in Madden NFL 15, Electronic Arts announced Saturday.

The 29-year-old Prater received a 95 overall rating in the game. Last season, he connected on 25-of-26 field goal attempts, including six from beyond 50 yards.

From Madden Ratings Czar Donny Moore:

It was a banner year for Prater, as he kicked the longest field goal in NFL history by booting a 64-yarder against the Titans. That’s worthy of a 99 KPW (kicking power) rating.

Chicago’s Robbie Gould and Baltimore’s Justin Tucker are next among kickers, each receiving a rating of 93.

Miami Dolphins’ Brandon Fields (96) is the top-ranked punter in the game, followed by San Francisco’s Andy Lee (95).

Prater is the fourth Broncos player to be ranked in the top five in their respective positions (EA released its list of kickers and punters together — Britton Colquitt may very well be in the top five among punters). Peyton Manning is the top overall quarterback, Von Miller is the top outside linebacker and T.J. Ward is the No. 3 strong safety.

Madden NFL 15 will be released Aug. 26 for the Xbox One, Xbox 360, PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 3.
