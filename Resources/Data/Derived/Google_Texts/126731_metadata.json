Another poll, by the Moscow-based Levada Center, found his general approval rating at 83, down from 89 in May.\n\nClearly, Putin\u2019s numbers are incredibly high by international standards, though, in an increasingly authoritarian country, there are plenty of reasons for citizens to be careful about expressing their honest opinions to government pollsters.\n\nRelated: How Many Russian Soldiers Have Died in Ukraine? A Glimpse at the Bloody Toll\n\nPutin\u2019s falling approval ratings suggest that the Russian people\u2019s increasing frustration with the economic privations brought on by the combination of plummeting oil and natural gas prices and international sanctions are both taking a toll.\n\nBoth problems can be credibly laid at Putin\u2019s feet.\n\nThe unexpected plunge in energy prices isn\u2019t his fault, but this isn\u2019t the first time Russia has gone down this road. The economy has been knocked off balance by global oil shocks before, and his government did little or nothing during the years when oil was selling near historic highs to use the revenue it derives from natural resources to diversify the country\u2019s economy.\n\nThe economic sanctions against Russia, likewise, are a direct effect of decisions made by Putin\u2019s government. The invasion of Crimea and the subsequent illegal annexation of the Ukrainian territory provoked European and North American countries to apply strong sanctions meant to economically punish the Putin regime. The Kremlin\u2019s subsequent support of armed rebellion in eastern Ukraine only increased them.\n\nRelated: As Putin Surfaces, Russian Ruble Takes a Dive\n\nThe combined result has been huge economic pain for the Russian people. A recent report by the Moscow Times, for example, found that clothing prices were likely to increase by 20 percent in September, even as general inflation remains well above 15 percent.\n\nUnder circumstances like that, Putin will have to lift an awful lot of weights to maintain the image of a leader able to pull his country through an increasingly difficult time.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Over the weekend, to the great joy of the Internet, the Kremlin released a set of pictures as well as a short video showing Russian President Vladimir Putin and Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, clad in workout clothes and hitting the gym in one of Putin\u2019s private residences before cooking steaks on a grill with a curiously American-looking \u201cBBQ\u201d label.", "title": "In Showing Off Physical Strength, Putin Tries to Hide Political Weakness", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/09/01/Showing-Physical-Strength-Putin-Tries-Hide-Political-Weakness", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/RTX1Q9SR.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/09/01/Showing-Physical-Strength-Putin-Tries-Hide-Political-Weakness", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/RTX1Q9SR.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Over the weekend, to the great joy of the Internet, the Kremlin released a set of pictures as well as a short video showing Russian President Vladimir Putin and Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, clad in workout clothes and hitting the gym in one of Putin\u2019s private residences before cooking steaks on a grill with a curiously American-looking \u201cBBQ\u201d label.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Related: As Putin Surfaces, Russian Ruble Takes a DiveThe combined result has been huge economic pain for the Russian people.\nThe economic sanctions against Russia, likewise, are a direct effect of decisions made by Putin\u2019s government.\nThe unexpected plunge in energy prices isn\u2019t his fault, but this isn\u2019t the first time Russia has gone down this road.\nAnother poll, by the Moscow-based Levada Center, found his general approval rating at 83, down from 89 in May.\nAs has been the case before, the appearance of new Kremlin photos meant to reinforce the idea of Putin as a man\u2019s man coincided with a small but significant drop in the Russian president\u2019s public approval rating."}
