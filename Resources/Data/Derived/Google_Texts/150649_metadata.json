Why fake it?\n\nNow that those cards are on the table, I\u2019ll tell you that even I had to turn off host Megyn Kelly this week as she railed against Obamcare \u201carchitect\u201d Jonathan Gruber and his caught-on-tape insults against, well, pretty much all Americans outside of his own elite circle of liberal Ivy League geniuses.\n\n\n\n[SEE: Political Cartoons on Obamacare]\n\nDid I turn off the TV because I disagreed with Kelly\u2019s outrage? No. Gruber\u2019s statements are absolutely outrageous. It\u2019s more that I didn\u2019t relate to her energy over the whole thing. There is absolutely nothing about this news that is one little bit surprising. This isn\u2019t a \u201cman bites dog\u201d story. It\u2019s closer to a \u201csky is blue\u201d headline.\n\nThe health care law is a disaster that was designed by big-government, big-brother-type liberals. That one of them appears to routinely refer to Americans as \u201cstupid\u201d is simply to be expected. I wish I could get more worked up about this, but Gruber\u2019s elitist world view isn\u2019t a revelation.\n\nAnother health care non-revelation this week was that small-business health care \u201cSHOP\u201d exchanges are an unmitigated failure.\n\nOnly 12,000 small employers have utilized the state-run SHOP exchanges \u2013 part of the Small Business Health Options Program \u2013 as of June, according to a new Government Accountability Office report. To put that in context, there are about 6 million small employer firms in the U.S. today.\n\nNumbers supposedly aren\u2019t available for the federally-run SHOP exchanges, but there isn\u2019t a health care analyst in America who thinks participation in the federal exchanges will be any better than the state exchanges. In fact, the participation rate in federally-run SHOP exchanges is likely to be even worse.\n\n\n\n[READ: Jonathan Gruber Stirs Up the Obamacare Debate Again]", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Thomas Jefferson Street [Opinion]", "title": "It's No Surprise Obamacare's Small Business Program Is Failing", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Obama's small business health care marketplace is a flop.", "title": "The Latest Obamacare Bust", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/opinion-blog/2014/11/14/its-no-surprise-obamacares-small-business-program-is-failing", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/43/4e/6be0e9174300bb70d81d8caa1655/20140722edstc-a.tif", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@USNews", "description": "Obama's small business health care marketplace is a flop.", "card": "summary", "title": "It's No Surprise Obamacare's Small Business Program Is Failing"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "opinion", "date_published": "Nov. 14, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Jean Card,Affordable Care Act,health care reform,small business,Obama administration,picks,Thomas Jefferson Street [Opinion]", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Obama's small business health care marketplace is a flop."}, "article_summary": "Another health care non-revelation this week was that small-business health care \u201cSHOP\u201d exchanges are an unmitigated failure.\nOnly 12,000 small employers have utilized the state-run SHOP exchanges \u2013 part of the Small Business Health Options Program \u2013 as of June, according to a new Government Accountability Office report.\nThe health care law is a disaster that was designed by big-government, big-brother-type liberals.\nIn fact, the participation rate in federally-run SHOP exchanges is likely to be even worse.\nTo put that in context, there are about 6 million small employer firms in the U.S. today."}
