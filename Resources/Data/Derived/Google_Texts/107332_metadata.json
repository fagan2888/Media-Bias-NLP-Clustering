Or, to put it another way, could what happened in the Republican primaries happen in the general election?\n\nSome, remembering that Ronald Reagan was once considered a right-wing lightweight, only to become a formidable candidate and well-liked president, wonder if Trump is being similarly underestimated.\n\nSo could Trump actually become president?\n\nAnything\u2019s possible, of course. And, given the pattern of national elections, my guess is that you\u2019ll see a period when he\u2019s tied or even leading in the polls.\n\nBut in the end, my expectation is that he\u2019ll fall seriously short.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere\u2019s why: Clinton\u2019s primary liabilities will emerge as (increasingly appreciated) general election strengths, while Trump\u2019s primary season strengths will set like cement as general-election liabilities.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the Donald because, let\u2019s face it, he\u2019s more interesting. In a many-splendored \u2014 well, multicandidate \u2014 GOP field, he galvanized a daunting bloc of voters by: (1) being bombastic, (2) trafficking in nativism, racism, and xenophobia, (3) going populist on trade, (4) carrying on like an insinuating frat boy, and (5) promising policy outcomes that are nigh unto impossible.\n\nNo one on the GOP side wanted to take him on in a major way, because doing so would have meant attacking Trump from the left in front of a primary electorate that skewed strongly right.\n\nBut as we move to the general, all that changes. Trump now must sell himself to a larger, center-left electorate.\n\nNow consider Clinton. In the primary, she had little pizzazz, in part because she was cautious, disciplined, and wonkish, and constrained by complexity.\n\nWhile Sanders talked about a revolution, she stayed focused on the affordable and achievable. That meant a smaller-bore series of plans rather than a broad call for sweeping change. Health policy illustrates that point: Sanders called for replacing the Affordable Care Act \u2014 a work-in-progress culmination of a long Democratic struggle \u2014 with the lefty catnip of single payer. Clinton focused on ways to make the ACA work better.\n\nBut after an impressive effort, Sanders is now on an also-ran trajectory. That leaves Clinton to face Trump.\n\nAnd look at that matchup:\n\nShe\u2019s conversant and comfortable with foreign-policy complexities. He\u2019s a man who, in one debate, seemed clueless about the concept of the triad, our land, air, and submarine-based nuclear-weapons capability.\n\nUnschooled in international affairs, he treats crucial doctrines and pivotal alliances as little more than ledger-sheet calculations. His is a Dollar Store foreign policy.\n\nHis domestic plans, meanwhile, are preposterous. His fiscal and budgetary plans can\u2019t be made to add up. His health-care \u201cplan\u201d is, to put it politely, at cross-purposes with itself.\n\nNow, in a Republican race chockablock with Obama-care-loathing supply-siders, none of that got pointed out in a concerted way. But there\u2019s no one better to prosecute that political case than Clinton, who has a deep knowledge of both foreign and domestic policy.\n\nSimply put, she will tie him in knots in the debates.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the matter of character. Voters clearly aren\u2019t crazy about Clinton. But her flaws pale in comparison to his.\n\nShe\u2019s a trimmer? He\u2019s a misinformation machine.\n\nShe\u2019s entitled? He\u2019s a raging narcissist.\n\nShe overstates her accomplishments? He\u2019s a braggart the likes of which we\u2019ve never seen in public life.\n\nShe\u2019s too calculating? He\u2019s a loose cannon on a pitching deck.\n\nShe plays the woman card? He\u2019s a sexist.\n\nShe\u2019s unlikable? He\u2019s . . . well, he\u2019s Donald Trump.\n\nSo, no, I don\u2019t think he can beat her.\n\nIn fact, I think November 8 will be an early night, leaving Democrats plenty of time to celebrate, and Republicans ample hours to drown their sorrows.", "article_metadata": {"eomportal-loid": "4.1.3550454274", "eomportal-id": 483323, "description": "Anything\u2019s possible, of course.
