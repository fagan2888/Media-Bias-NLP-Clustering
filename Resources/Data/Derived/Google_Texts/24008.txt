From our colleague Dan Chapman:

Ted Cruz repeatedly invoked former President Jimmy Carter on Saturday in an effort to score points with Georgia voters. It was Carter, after all, who said earlier month he prefers Donald Trump to Cruz because he’s “completely malleable.”

“On the other hand, Ted Cruz is not malleable,” the former president and one-time Georgia governor said during an appearance at Britain’s House of Lords. “He has far-right wing policies he’d pursue if he became president.”

Cruz, in a press conference before Saturday’s rally in downtown Atlanta, wore Carter’s criticism as a badge of courage.

“Here’s something I’ve never said before: I agree with Jimmy Carter,” Cruz allowed. “If you want someone who cuts deals with Democrats, you have several choices in this race. … If you want someone to defend the constitution and the Bill of Rights, to repeal Obamacare and abolish the IRS, I ask you to stand with us Tuesday.”
