Officials say the Texas Roadhouse near I-10 and Cortaro is now reopened after a fire Sunday afternoon.

Multiple people called 911 around 4:18 p.m., according to Captain Adam Goldberg with Northwest Fire.

He said crews had the flames out in about four minutes and damage inside was minimal and contained to the water heater room.

Smoke poured into the dining area just as the dinner rush began to pickup, and Goldberg said the staff did a great job of evacuating the restaurant.

Fire inspectors took over the investigation, and estimated there fire caused $5,000 in damage. Goldberg said it would be up to inspectors from the Pima County Health Department to allow the restaurant to reopen.
