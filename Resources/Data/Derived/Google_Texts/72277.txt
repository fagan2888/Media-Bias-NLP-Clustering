A father and his daughter are dead following a head-on crash Friday afternoon in Ottawa County.

It happened around 4 p.m. on K-18 about three and a half miles east of Bennington.

The Kansas Highway Patrol said a westbound Chevy pickup steered into oncoming traffic to avoid a vehicle stopped on the side of the highway, partially in the westbound lane. The pick-up then hit an eastbound Plymouth Neon head-on.

The two in the Neon were pronounced dead at the scene. They have been identified as 18-year-old Emma Jo Pisocki, who was driving the car, and 41-year-old Jason Pisocki. Both were from Topeka.

The driver of the pickup, 35-year-old Jason Jeardoe of Bennington, was taken to a Salina hospital for treatment of potentially serious injuries.
