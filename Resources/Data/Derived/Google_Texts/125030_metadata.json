Jose grew up with his mom in a one bedroom apartment in a low-income Chicago neighborhood. He dreamed of becoming a scientist and discovering new planets and stars.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThis spring, Jose graduated from Chicago\u2019s Noble Street College Prep, a public charter school that is sending all of its graduates to college. Next stop: Stanford University, where he\u2019ll become the first in his family to go to college.\n\nThe other student is Carlene Ervin. Carlene has spent most of her childhood in foster care, an experience that left her feeling angry, bitter, and lonely. But thanks to her own hard work and the dedication of her teachers at Aspire California College Prep Academy in Berkeley, Carlene is graduating high school and heading to Yale in the fall.\n\nThe remarkable thing about Jose and Carlene \u2013 and tens of thousands of other charter school graduates \u2013 is that in a different school, these kids might never have made it to college.\n\nAmerica\u2019s high school graduation rate is on the rise \u2013 the latest data show that 78 percent of high school freshmen graduate in four years. Unfortunately, graduating from high school doesn\u2019t always mean students are ready for college.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Education recently found that black, Hispanic, and Native American students are disproportionately likely to attend schools that don\u2019t offer college-prep courses, including algebra 2, chemistry, and Advanced Placement courses.\n\nTragically, only 12 percent of low-income high school graduates earn a four-year college degree. At a time of heightened concern about economic inequality and lack of mobility in America, these young adults are being kept off the ladder of economic success.\n\nThe good news is that some public schools \u2013 particularly public charter schools \u2013 are proving that all students, regardless of their socioeconomic background, can be prepared for college. And their formula can be replicated.\n\nIt starts with an emphasis on college-readiness from day one.\n\nAt YES Prep Public Schools in Houston and Minneapolis, college visits begin in sixth grade. Why? So that students know that college is both expected and within reach.\n\nLaying the groundwork is paying off. For the past 15 years, 100 percent of YES Prep graduates \u2013 most of whom are from low-income families \u2013 have been accepted at four-year colleges and universities.\n\nThe second step is rigorous coursework.\n\nAt Charles A. Tindley charter school in Indianapolis, every student must complete a college-readiness curriculum \u2013 including calculus and philosophy \u2013 before graduation. The result: More than 80 percent of Tindley alums have graduated college or are currently enrolled.\n\nThe third step is helping students apply to college.\n\nLEAD Academy in Nashville, Tennessee, has a department of college counseling that, starting in freshman year, guides students and parents through the process of selecting and applying for college. Recruiters from colleges are brought to LEAD\u2019s campus, and students get advice on practical matters like preparing resumes and writing college essays.\n\nIn May, President Bill Clinton Bill ClintonThe Trail 2016: Interleague play Could Romanian hacker \u2018Guccifer\u2019 assist FBI\u2019s probe of Clinton? Trump: Vince Foster shouldn\u2019t be a campaign issue MORE joined LEAD\u2019s inaugural 2014 graduating class for their Senior Signing Day, where every single student got to stand on stage and proudly raise the banner of the college they\u2019ll attend this fall.\n\nThe fourth step is putting college within financial reach.\n\nAt Horizon Honors High School in Phoenix, the 78 graduates in the class of 2014 have secured $5.7 million in scholarship funding \u2013 an average of $73,000 per student. That\u2019s because Horizon, like many charter schools, scours funding sources and helps students and their parents apply for every available dollar.\n\nAnd the final step is helping students make the transition to college life.\n\nUplift Education, a charter school operator with 12 campuses in the Dallas-Ft. Worth area, has a Summer Bridge program that prepares graduates for the academic and social challenges of college. Uplift connects alumni with new graduates, so experienced college students can show the newbies the ropes.\n\nAll of these tools for college success are available in our nation\u2019s best high schools, in the best neighborhoods. What charter schools have done is bring them to students in inner cities and other areas where college is too often considered out of reach.\n\nRemember that charter schools are public schools, not elite private academies. There\u2019s no reason other public schools can\u2019t adopt these same successful practices. Not every student will want to go to college, of course. But every student who wants to go to college should have a high school experience that prepares them for post-secondary success.\n\nAs we celebrate our graduates this month, let\u2019s renew our commitment to make sure that every student who leaves 12th grade is ready \u2013 like Jose Serrano and Carlene Ervin \u2013 to make the most of the opportunities that lie ahead.\n\nRees is president and CEO of the National Alliance for Public Charter Schools.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Only 12 percent of low-income high school graduates earn a four-year college degree.", "description": "Only 12 percent of low-income high school graduates earn a four-year college degree.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Congress Blog"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Only 12 percent of low-income high school graduates earn a four-year college degree.", "title": "Every H.S. grad should be college-ready", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/education/210863-every-hs-grad-should-be-college-ready", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-02T05:39:37-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-02T05:39-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/education/210863-every-hs-grad-should-be-college-ready", "dcterms.date": "2014-06-28T09:00-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Joe Picard", "author": "Nina Rees", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",Bill Clinton,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-28T09:00:02-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-02T05:39:37-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/education/210863-every-hs-grad-should-be-college-ready", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Only 12 percent of low-income high school graduates earn a four-year college degree.", "card": "summary", "title": "Every H.S. grad should be college-ready"}, "dcterms.title": "Every H.S. grad should be college-ready"}, "article_summary": "America\u2019s high school graduation rate is on the rise \u2013 the latest data show that 78 percent of high school freshmen graduate in four years.\nRemember that charter schools are public schools, not elite private academies.\nRees is president and CEO of the National Alliance for Public Charter Schools.\nADVERTISEMENTThis spring, Jose graduated from Chicago\u2019s Noble Street College Prep, a public charter school that is sending all of its graduates to college.\nThe good news is that some public schools \u2013 particularly public charter schools \u2013 are proving that all students, regardless of their socioeconomic background, can be prepared for college."}
