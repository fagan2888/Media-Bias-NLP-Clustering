But when we look past words to what the administration is actually doing to our retirement system, the gap between happy talk and damaging action is stark.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHaving spent more than three decades helping build up America\u2019s workplace savings system, let me try to explain, in plain language, the two-pronged threat that the administration is now posing to the future of our private retirement savings system.\n\nThis past April, for the second time since 2010, the Department of Labor (DOL) re-proposed a massively complex rule \u2013 roughly the length of \u201cWar and Peace\u201d \u2013 that would rework America\u2019s retirement system root and branch. Its ostensible aim is to ensure that investment and retirement advisers put their clients \u201cbest interests\u201d first and act as true fiduciaries. This, I hasten to say, is an ideal that all of us in the retirement services industry share -- provided it is done right.\n\nUnfortunately, the DOL\u2019s proposal is so unwieldy, complex, and costly that it would do far more damage to working Americans\u2019 retirement security than any of the abuses it aims to correct. As drafted, it would severely limit access to routine investment advice for tens of millions of retirement savers. It would also make it nearly impossible for service providers to present investment advice and options to businesses with less than 100 employees.\n\nThe effect, if not the intent, would be to stymie the growth of the workplace savings system \u2013 period. Virtually all new businesses, after all, start with fewer than 100 workers. Twelve years ago this month, Facebook had five.\n\nThe rule\u2019s impact on individual retirement savers\u2019 would also be quite painful. Credible analysis suggests it would cause tens of billions of dollars in losses to savers and retirees over the next decade due to a cut-off of routine investment advice that low-balance savers can count on today.\n\nAll that is bad enough. But wait \u2013 there\u2019s more.\n\nAt the behest of the White House, the Labor Department is also advancing another major change to retirement savings -- making it easier for state governments around the country to offer state-mandated Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) for private workers. The plans would be exempt from most of the costly investor protection regulations that private plans must live by under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA).\n\nHere again, the goal of the Administration and of the sponsors of these emerging state-level plans is laudable. America really must address the workplace savings \u201ccoverage gap.\u201d Roughly 50 million workers have no workplace savings options. The ideal solution would be national legislation that provides every American worker access to a payroll deduction savings option on the job.\n\nBut Congress\u2019s failure -- so far -- to close the \u201ccoverage gap\u201d is no justification for proliferating what may be dozens of state savings arrangements, free from the protections that ERISA mandates and free also to compete unfairly with private plans that meet those higher standards.\n\nTaken together, the DOL\u2019s twin rule-making efforts promises to have impacts as sweeping as any major piece of pension law in decades. But these profound changes \u2013 which could never survive democratic debate and passage through Congress -- are being enacted through a complex, \u201cblack box\u201d bureaucratic process \u2013 leaving Congress as almost a by-stander.\n\nFortunately, as thousands of citizens and small businesses weigh in to object to what DOL is doing, Congress has begun to offer more effective \u2013 and constructive \u2013 alternatives.\n\nBipartisan legislation to protect retirement savers and ensure that their interests come first has been introduced in both houses of Congress. It would achieve the \u201cbest interest\u201d goal DOL is aiming for \u2013 but without a crippling burden of red tape. I would also hope we can find bipartisan support for the Auto-IRA concept -- a truly national solution to filling America\u2019s workplace savings \u201ccoverage gap.\u201d\n\nBut for those positive gains to happen, Congress needs to wake up \u2013 soon -- to the seriousness of DOL\u2019s two-pronged regulatory assault on our private retirement savings system. As John Mitchell warned us long ago, we need to look beyond what the administration is saying \u2013 and see what they are doing \u2013 before truly serious damage gets done.\n\nReynolds is president and CEO of Putnam Investments and Great-West Financial, whose Empower Retirement unit serves more than 7 million workplace savers.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The Labor Department poses two threats to private retirement savings.", "description": "The Labor Department poses two threats to private retirement savings.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Congress Blog"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The Labor Department poses two threats to private retirement savings.", "title": "Obamacare for the 401(k) world?", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/economy-budget/273588-obamacare-for-the-401k-world", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-03-21T13:00:01-04:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-03-21T13:00-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/economy-budget/273588-obamacare-for-the-401k-world", "dcterms.date": "2016-03-21T13:00-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Joe Picard", "author": "Robert L.
