Other options:

The clinic says it will lease a six-story office building in London’s West End, just across the street from the Buckingham Palace Gardens. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed, but Cleveland.com reports that rents in the area can be up to six times the average downtown Cleveland rate.



The move is the clinic's latest effort to expand its services abroad from its main campus in Cleveland. Outside of its Ohio facilities, the Clinic also has offices in Florida, Las Vegas, Toronto and Abu Dhabi.



Dr. Marc Harrison, the clinic's chief of International Business Development, says they’re still examining which services to offer to complement the existing healthcare options in that part of London.
