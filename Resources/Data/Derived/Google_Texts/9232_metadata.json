Thousands who had bought insurance have been receiving cancellations notices from insurers. The president said he wasn\u2019t aware his promise before the rollout would result in cancellations, and Obama had repeatedly stated that, although new health-care insurance would be available through the Affordable Care Act, those willing to stay on their plan would be able to do so.In fact, that wasn\u2019t the case.

We don\u2019t slaughter people for their religious beliefs. We don\u2019t use blasphemy laws to repress people. But we are in the midst of a muddle about where religion and state draw their \u201cred lines,\u201d and it isn\u2019t going so well for the religious-liberty lobby.\n\nAs it turns out, many in the audience were reaching for their own jaws when Obama got to the liberty section of his speech, according to several people who attended the breakfast. Michael Cromartie, vice president of the Ethics and Public Policy Center, summed up the general reaction of many with whom he spoke: \u201cStunned.\u201d\n\n\u201cSeveral people said afterward how encouraged they would have been by President Obama\u2019s remarks if only his acts reflected what he said,\u201d Cromartie told me.\n\nOne table was applauding only out of politeness, according to Jerry Pattengale, who was sitting with Steve Green \u2014 president of the Hobby Lobby stores that have challenged Obamacare\u2019s contraceptive mandate. Pattengale described the experience as \u201csurrealistic.\u201d\n\nThe government\u2019s position is that because Hobby Lobby is a for-profit business, its owners\u2019 religious beliefs can\u2019t be imposed on their employees. Hobby Lobby insists it shouldn\u2019t have to sacrifice its Christian beliefs regarding human life.\n\nPattengale, assistant provost at Indiana Wesleyan University and research consultant to the Green family, also noted the disconnect between the president\u2019s message and policies at home that \u201care creating a queue at the Supreme Court.\u201d\n\nPerhaps Obama\u2019s advisers counted on the goodwill of the audience. Or they reckoned that, juxtaposed against atrocities committed elsewhere, our debates about birth control might be viewed as not much ado.\n\nIt is understandable that many Americans might not see these legal challenges as especially pressing, especially if they\u2019d just like insurance coverage for contraception \u2014 a position with which I personally have no disagreement. But these cases are more than a debate about birth control. They have far-reaching implications and, as Obama pointed out, there is a strong correlation between religious freedom and a nation\u2019s stability: \u201cHistory shows that nations that uphold the rights of their people \u2014 including the freedom of religion \u2014 are ultimately more just and more peaceful and more successful.\u201d\n\nSince this is so, one wonders why the Obama administration is so dedicated to forcing people to act against their own conscience. By requiring through the contraceptive mandate that some religious-affiliated groups provide health plans covering what they consider abortifacient contraceptives, isn\u2019t the Obama administration effectively imposing its own religious rules? Thou shalt not protect unborn life.\n\nThe answer to this question is above my paygrade, as Obama memorably answered when asked by Pastor Rick Warren when life begins. The more germane question to cases such as Hobby Lobby and the Little Sisters is whether the government can accomplish its goal of making free contraception available without burdening religious objectors. Can\u2019t women in Colorado get contraception without forcing the Little Sisters, a group of nuns who care for the elderly, to violate their core beliefs? Their charitable work could not long survive under penalties the government would impose on them for noncompliance.\n\nFor now, the Little Sisters have been granted a reprieve, thanks to Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor. Arguments in the Hobby Lobby case are scheduled for March, with a decision expected in June. Meanwhile, another case settled in 2012 reveals much about this administration\u2019s willingness to challenge religious freedom. In Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church and School v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the question boiled down to whether the government can decide whom a church hires as minister. Since when?\n\nNot yet. In a rare move, all nine justices ruled against the government, stating that the federal government does not, alas, get to direct who preaches the Gospel. But it wanted to.\n\nRead more from Kathleen Parker\u2019s archive, follow her on Twitter or find her on Facebook.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Obama ignores the erosion of religious freedom he ignited.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/kathleenparker", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Obama ignores the erosion of religious freedom he ignited.", "title": "Kathleen Parker: Obama ignores his attacks on religious liberty", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/kathleen-parker-obama-ignores-his-attacks-on-religious-liberty/2014/02/07/d4209ef2-903b-11e3-b46a-5a3d0d2130da_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/02/07/Editorial-Opinion/Images/Obama_Prayer_Breakfast-084c6.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@kathleenparker"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/kathleen-parker-obama-ignores-his-attacks-on-religious-liberty/2014/02/07/d4209ef2-903b-11e3-b46a-5a3d0d2130da_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Kathleen Parker, kathleen parker column, kathleen parker washington post, obamacare, health care reform, contraceptive mandate, religious organizations contraception, birth control mandate, birth control hobby lobby, contraception hobby lobby, little sisters of the poor contraception, little sisters of the poor birth control, obama national prayer breakfast,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/kathleenparker"}, "eomportal-uuid": "d4209ef2-903b-11e3-b46a-5a3d0d2130da", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "Kathleen Parker, kathleen parker column, kathleen parker washington post, obamacare, health care reform, contraceptive mandate, religious organizations contraception, birth control mandate, birth control hobby lobby, contraception hobby lobby, little sisters of the poor contraception, little sisters of the poor birth control, obama national prayer breakfast,"}, "article_summary": "President Obama gave a lovely speech at the recent National Prayer Breakfast \u2014 and one is reluctant to criticize.\nWithout a hint of irony, the president lamented eroding protections of religious liberty around the world.\nNary a mention of the legal challenges to religious liberty now in play between this administration and the Catholic Church and other religious groups, as well as private businesses that contest the contraceptive mandate in Obamacare.\nFor now, the Little Sisters have been granted a reprieve, thanks to Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor.\nArguments in the Hobby Lobby case are scheduled for March, with a decision expected in June."}
