“The Right Side Forum,” a live, hour-long conservative news and talk show hosted by columnist Armstrong Williams, will take a look at the greater implication of changing seasons and “why black lives matter.” Labor Day weekend marks the unofficial end of summer, a summer that for Washington, DC – and too many other urban areas across the nation – has seen an increase in gun-related deaths, Armstrong says.

“The #BlackLivesMatter movement has drawn attention to the number of those deaths that were of African Americans at the hands of the police. This week, the panel will examine how #BlackLivesMatter activists have also sparked a nationwide conversation about ways of responding to crime within the African American community.

“I get #BlackLivesMatter. What I want now is to find new ways of turning that energy toward everyone who diminishes black lives, including those within the African American community. My guests have a lot of experience working to bring peace to the streets of some of our nation’s most challenging urban areas. I can’t wait to hear what they have to say,” Armstrong notes.

His guest this week are Eugene Puryear, Field Director for Justice First; Ron Moten, author of “Drinking Muddy Water”; and Ivan Cloyd, a member of the Alliance of Concerned Men and a motivational speaker.

The Right Side Forum, which debuted in January, airs live on Saturday mornings at 10:30 a.m. on News Channel 8 in the Washington, D.C., area, and repeats again at 6:30 p.m.
