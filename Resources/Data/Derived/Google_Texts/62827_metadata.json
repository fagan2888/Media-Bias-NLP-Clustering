(Photo courtesy of Angela Cristoforos)\n\nBOSTON \u2013 This city so full of history, culture, distinctive neighborhoods, champion sports teams and nationally ranked universities, breeds what is quite possibly one of the most notable regional accents in the nation, one that can be regarded as either a trademark or a curse, depending on perspective.\n\nThe speech inflections known as a Boston accent \u2013 most prominently the dropped Rs \u2013 can be picked up through meticulous training, often by actors for roles in films set in the city or the region, like \u201cGone Girl,\u201d \u201cGoodwill Hunting\u201d and \u201cBlack Mass.\u201d More often, training helps people erase the traces of their regional roots.\n\nTruth be told, those locals whose speech is thick with Southie flavor can often find themselves the butt of jokes in other parts of the country. What Hub native hasn\u2019t been asked to say: \u2018Park the car in Harvard Yard\u2019 at least once when visiting Manhattan or Los Angeles, for instance?\n\nThe accent, which has spread far in New England, from Maine and New Hampshire to Rhode Island, can be a revered piece of regional identity or the subject of none-too-sympathetic segments from the likes of national television\u2019s \u201cThe Daily Show \u201c or \u201cThe Today Show.\u201d So it may come as scant surprise that some area natives have dropped some serious dollars to drop their Boston accents, faster than they drop their Rs in any given conversation.\n\nFor one local speaking coach, it provides a steady source of clients. Marjorie Whittaker, a speech pathologist and founder of The Whittaker Group in Brookline who has many specialties in the art of communication, helps people learn how to \u201cswitch off\u201d regional accents.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing wrong with a Boston accent or any accent,\u201d she said in a recent interview \u201cWe\u2019re all from somewhere. But the problem is, there tends to be some stereotypic reactions to it that people often have that you can\u2019t control.\u201d\n\n\u201cMost clients who do a lot of public speaking or are seeking high-level business positions deal with people who may question their credibility due to their accent, which can develop a bit of a confidence problem,\u201d Whittaker said.\n\nPeople who aren\u2019t from the U.S. Northeast may associate a Boston accent with a lack of intelligence or education, she said. Popular media can fuel such stereotypes, she added.\n\nRather than suggest to clients that an accent is something bad, she tries to help them learn how to switch it off when they want, if they worry that it may get in the way of professional advancement.\n\n\u201cSo many people come to me and say, \u2018I keep getting passed over for a promotion, and I don\u2019t think my boss takes me seriously enough,\u201d she said. \u201cOr, \u2018I have to speak in front of all these people, and I don\u2019t think I sound as polished as I\u2019d like.\u2019\u201d\n\nWhittaker also helps people deal with what she refers to as speech disfluency, or the repetition of words, parts of words or expressions such as \u201cum\u201d and \u201cyou know.\u201d She recalled once hearing a speaker on a radio broadcast with a significant disfluency problem.\n\n\u201cThis person inserted an \u2018um\u2019 every other word in his sentence!\u201d Whittaker said with a laugh. \u201cI was so distracted from the content, I started only paying attention to the \u2018ums\u2019 and couldn\u2019t get past it.\u201d\n\nA heavy accent can produce the same effect.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I think sometimes happens with the Boston accent,\u201d Whittaker said. When a speaker\u2019s pronunciations differ distinctly form what an audience is used to hearing, listeners get distracted and focus on how something is being said rather than what is said.\n\nThere\u2019s enough demand in the Hub for accent-erasing help that Whittaker regularly collaborates with Boston Casting and the Boston Center for Adult Education to hold speech diction workshops. The most recent took place Dec. 12.\n\nWhittaker usually works one-on-one with those seeking help. Clients have ranged from non-native English speakers to business executives, doctors, teachers and on-air broadcast personalities.\n\n\u201cSometimes it\u2019s a student who wants to make the best impression for interviews,\u201d Whittaker said, adding there\u2019s wide gamut of issues that can arise based on speaking ability. \u201cI spoke with a woman in the medical field. She was told if she didn\u2019t fix her accent, they wouldn\u2019t license her. It was really critical for her because it\u2019s a matter of life or death \u2013 did you say 15 milligrams or 50? Did you say \u2018bleeding\u2019 or \u2018breathing\u2019? It\u2019s not about prejudice \u2013 someone\u2019s life can be at stake.\u201d\n\nJohn Rossi, who spent most of his youth in Brighton and Allston neighborhoods, didn\u2019t realize how many words he didn\u2019t pronounce or enunciate properly until he went off to college in Connecticut, then landed in New York and began unintentionally entertaining coworkers.\n\n\u201cLeaving Boston made me become more aware of my accent,\u201d Rossi said. \u201c\u2018Hey, how are you?\u2019 sounds like \u2018howaya.\u2019\u201d\n\nRossi began working with Whittaker in 2011 to help him switch it off when needed.\n\nBut that\u2019s not all the time. Working as a promoter and marketer for Def Jam Records in New York, Rossi said his accent makes him popular around the office. Coworkers \u201cget a kick out of it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt never gets old to them. They think it\u2019s hilarious.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t mind, because that\u2019s who I am and how I talk,\u201d he said. While Rossi hasn\u2019t worked with Whittaker in years, he still goes back to her lesson books when he feels the need to tone it down.\n\nBroadcast reporter Angela Cristoforos, who grew up in Salem, first reached out to Whittaker after graduating from Boston\u2019s Suffolk University in 2012. As the child of Greek immigrants, her first language growing up was Greek \u2013 she was enrolled in English as a second language classes in grade school. So her Boston accent only multiplied the issues she confronted trying to break into broadcasting.\n\nNow an on-air news reporter, Cristoforos said she can control her accent, especially when appearing on camera.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important that viewers can understand me, and depending on the region you come from, the Boston accent may sound confusing,\u201d she said. \u201cSpeaking professionally is an absolute necessity.\u201d\n\nIt can also be a key to landing a job in the first place, she added.\n\n\u201cA lot of times when a news director is hiring a reporter, they look at your newsreels, they observe your appearance, your delivery and especially how you speak,\u201d Cristoforos said. \u201cIt can really dictate whether they\u2019ll hire you or not.\u201d\n\nShe still works on ridding her diction of traces of her Boston-area roots.\n\n\u201cFriends tell me they barely hear it on TV,\u201d she said. \u201cYou may hear a bit more on a Friday night, after a drink or two,\u201d she added with a laugh. \u201cThere are still some words I struggle with.\u201d\n\nHowever, Cristoforos doesn\u2019t want to lose her Boston voice completely. It\u2019s part of who she is, after all.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want my accent to go away, because that\u2019s what makes me, me,\u201d Cristoforos said. \u201cI\u2019m proud of where I\u2019m from.\u201d\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.", "article_metadata": {"shareaholic": {"site_name": "NewBostonPost", "language": "en-US", "url": "http://newbostonpost.com/2015/12/21/speech-coach-helps-locals-paahk-their-accents/", "article_author_name": "Gina Kim", "image": "http://newbostonpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/12193663_918605441541723_684026988839119644_n-e1453914800948.jpg", "site_id": "ab905d8abdbd23a369259b08e0927728", "shareable_page": "true", "keywords": "accent, boston, Boston accent, Maine, Massachusetts, new hampshire, regional, regional speech, Rhode Island, speech pathologist"}, "description": "Boston breeds what is quite possibly one of the most notable regional accents in the nation, one that can be regarded as either a trademark or a curse.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"image": "http://newbostonpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/12193663_918605441541723_684026988839119644_n-e1453914800948.jpg"}, "keywords": "boston,accent,regional,boston accent,maine,massachusetts,new hampshire,regional speech,rhode island,speech pathologist", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Speech coach helps locals \u2018paahk\u2019 their accentsPrinted from: http://newbostonpost.com/2015/12/21/speech-coach-helps-locals-paahk-their-accents/Buffalo, N.Y., TV reporter Angela Cristoforos from Salem learned how to turn off her Boston accent to help her break into broadcasting.\n\u201cThere is nothing wrong with a Boston accent or any accent,\u201d she said in a recent interview \u201cWe\u2019re all from somewhere.\nPeople who aren\u2019t from the U.S. Northeast may associate a Boston accent with a lack of intelligence or education, she said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s important that viewers can understand me, and depending on the region you come from, the Boston accent may sound confusing,\u201d she said.\nSo her Boston accent only multiplied the issues she confronted trying to break into broadcasting."}
