But 64 years ago, Wyoming thumped the Bears 103-0, setting an NCAA record for most points in a game. A mark that still stands.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve talked about putting a 100 on them,\u201d Gentry said. \u201cWe can\u2019t come out lightly and play down to their level.\u201d\n\nThe Bears, a member of the Big Sky Conference, are playing up a notch in the NCAA\u2019s competition levels when playing the Cowboys of the Mountain West.\n\nThey\u2019re facing a Wyoming team that is a contender for the Mountain Division title. The Bears are building on a program that could finish down in the pack of their conference and lost last week to NCAA Division II CSU-Pueblo.\n\nThe Cowboys are led by quarterback Brett Smith, one of the top offensive players in the Mountain West.\n\nGentry has become a reliable target for Smith.\n\nGentry, who came to Wyoming out of Grandview High School in Aurora, has caught eight of Smith\u2019s passes for 97 yards in the first two games. Smith already has 51 pass completions for 678 yards and eight touchdowns.\n\n\u201cThis is a great program for receivers,\u201d Gentry said. \u201cThis is the place I want to be. Brett\u2019s a great quarterback and the leader on the offensive side of the ball.\u201d\n\nGentry is playing his first season of college football at 6-foot-2, 190 pounds. Coach Dave Christensen noted Gentry\u2019s work in preseason practice.\n\n\u201cHe earned a starting spot on a team that has a lot of depth at the receiver position,\u201d Christensen said. \u201cHe\u2019s a great young prospect.\u201d\n\nChristensen isn\u2019t talking 100 points.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m only concerned about our execution and hope that we execute well enough to win the game,\u201d Christensen said.\n\nIrv Moss: 303-954-1296, imoss@denverpost.com or twitter.com/irvmoss", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Wyoming hoping to put historic thumping on Northern Colorado", "title": "Wyoming hoping to put historic thumping on Northern Colorado", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/09/13/wyoming-hoping-to-put-historic-thumping-on-northern-colorado/", "image": {"width": 481, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130913__tanner-gentry-SPXXPRPALLCOLORADOFB___CM23427p1.jpg", "height": 600}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130913__tanner-gentry-SPXXPRPALLCOLORADOFB___CM23427p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-09-13T19:15:10+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T14:36:47+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cI\u2019m only concerned about our execution and hope that we execute well enough to win the game,\u201d Christensen said.\nBut 64 years ago, Wyoming thumped the Bears 103-0, setting an NCAA record for most points in a game.\nIt\u2019s not his scholastic major, but Wyoming freshman wide receiver Tanner Gentry must have a minor in football history.\nThe football history shows that Wyoming and UNC have played 25 times, but not since 1949.\nEither that or it was youthful enthusiasm that entered his thoughts earlier in the week when he talked about Saturday\u2019s game in Laramie against the University of Northern Colorado."}
