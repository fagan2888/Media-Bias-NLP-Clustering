It has been called discriminatory by Justice Department because of the communities it primarily impacts, minorities, elderly and young people. It's no coincidence that these tend to be Democratic constituencies and the politics of preservation play a role in its intent. \u201cWithout voter fraud, Obamacare would not exist,\u201d Abbott said at the Texas Tribune Festival this year.\n\nEarlier this week Abbott tweeted, \u201cAnother conviction for Voter Fraud in Texas,\u201d referring to a case in South Texas of mail in fraud. There was no reference to mail in fraud in the tweet, but it in all cases of fraud since 2002 there have only been a total of about 28 convictions according to an article by Politifact. In question, was Abbotts statement claiming, \u201csince 2002 \u2026 election fraud investigations by the Texas Attorney General's Office have resulted in 50 convictions,\u201d which they rated as \u201cHalf-True.\u201d Even more important, only 2 convictions were for \u201cvoter impersonation\u201d which was supposedly why the Voter ID law is so important.\n\nAccording to the Dallas Morning News Abbott, \u201chas pursued 66 people on charges of voting irregularities since 2004. Only four cases involved someone illegally casting a ballot at a polling place where a picture ID would have prevented it,\u201d adding, \u201cAbbott acknowledged that voter ID wouldn't have made a difference in most of the cases he has prosecuted.\u201d When pressed Abbott said told DMN, \u201cIt's hard to put a number on it\u2026If you don't have any photo ID requirements, how do you know the person coming up to vote is the person they say they are?\u201d A that question would certainly remain for mail in ballots. \u201cIf you really wanted to go after all the voter irregularities, you'd be looking at mail ballots,\u201d Rep. Trey Martinez Fischer told the DMN.\n\nCheck below the jump to see whose claim is backed by the Elections Committee's interim report\u2026\n\n\n\nThe Texas House Committee on Elections Interim Report seems to agree with Martinez Fischer, \u201cOverall, most allegations of election fraud that appear in the news result in indictments relate to early voting by mail ballots.\u201d They also mention Abbott's reference to voter fraud as an \u201cepidemic.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe've had far more instances of voter fraud than instances of people not being able to vote because of the voter ID law,\u201d Abbott said. The facts don't seem to support this statement. Linda Krefting, President of The League of Women Voters of Texas, which is opposed to the law, told the New York Times, \u201cWe have always felt there was anywhere from 500,000 to 800,000 voters who would not be able to present the proper identification.\u201d\n\nAbbott may contend, to much disagreement, that the Voter ID law does not target historically disadvantaged groups but for sincerity sake lets consider the ID that are acceptable. A concealed handgun license, yes, a valid student ID from a state university, no. Oh, you are an international traveler? Just present your passport at the voting booth. Yes you can get your free ID but you must go to the DMV and wait there first, at least a full 30 before the election, long before many busy middle-class and low income (potential) voters start paying attention to what is on the ballot. Need more evidence? Only 121 state photo IDs had been issued by Election Day, and the amount of provisional ballots cast in 2013 more than tripled from 2011 before the law passed.\n\nYou can follow me on Twitter at @joethepleb.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Greg Abbott is a chief advocate for Texas&apos; current Voter ID law.
