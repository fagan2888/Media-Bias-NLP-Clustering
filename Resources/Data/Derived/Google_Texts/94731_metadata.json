Two days later, according to the Estonian government, Russian agents crossed the border, and using smoke grenades and radio jamming devices, kidnapped an officer of the country\u2019s Internal Security Service.\n\nThe officer, Eston Kohver, appeared later that day in Moscow, where he was charged with spying and carrying an illegal handgun, according to the British Broadcasting Corporation. Russia claims that Kohver was arrested on Russian soil, but Estonian officials claim that not only is this untrue, but that Kohver appears to have walked into a trap set by Russia\u2019s security service, the FSB.\n\nRelated: Two Former Senators Play Fast and Loose with Russian Sanctions\n\nThe alleged kidnapping of Kohver has increased tensions among the independent states in Europe and Asia that were once part of the Soviet Union. Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine\u2019s Crimean peninsula this summer, and its ongoing support, including troops and weaponry, of rebels in Eastern Ukraine has many concerned that Russian President Vladimir Putin intends to reunite the former Soviet Union by force.\n\nIn remarks at the opening of the Estonian Parliament on Monday, President Toomas Hendrik Ilves said that Russia\u2019s aggression in Ukraine has revealed its true intent.\n\n\u201cThe masks have fallen,\u201d he said. \u201cWe see how Russia continues to isolate itself from democratic nations.\u201d Addressing the taking of the security officer, he said, \u201cRussian security service FSB kidnapped an Estonian citizen from Estonian soil and took him to a prison in Moscow and even bans the Estonian consul from meeting the Estonian citizen.\u201d\n\nRelated: How Europe\u2019s Economic Slump Could Doom Ukraine\n\nIlves made it clear that he is counting on his country\u2019s relationship with the West \u2013 including the United States \u2013 to protect Estonia from its much larger neighbor.\n\n\u201cOur past decision - to embrace democracy, a rule of law, the European Union and NATO is now our best defense,\u201d Ilves said.\n\nEstonian officials said Kohver was in a wooded area near the town of Miikse in southeast Estonia, near the Russian border when he was abducted. Officials told Estonian media that Kohver was an organized crime investigator, and was there to meet an alleged informant.\n\nArnold Sinisalu, the head of the Estonian Internal Security Service, said that Kohver had armed backup officers nearby, but they were unable to react in time, because the abductors used smoke grenades and radio jamming devices to make communications difficult.\n\nRelated: Don\u2019t Expect NATO to Ante Up the Money for Ukraine\n\n\u201cOne must take into account the fact the thick smoke the explosive device produced, and when the forces reacted Eston Kohver was already taken to Russia,\u201d Sinisalu said.\n\nKohver was quickly taken to Moscow, where he was charged with spying and illegal possession of a firearm. Russian officials displayed his property to the media, including a pistol, a recording device, and 5,000 euros in cash. They said that he was carrying documents \u201cindicative of an intelligence mission.\u201d\n\nEstonian officials retorted that the cash and recording device had been for the informant who Kohver was supposed to be meeting\n\nEven in the event the Estonian government\u2019s version of the story turns out to be true, the idea of Russian agents crossing the border of another former Soviet state is sure to provoke worry in Russia\u2019s other, smaller neighbors. The crisis in Ukraine has been punctuated with stories of \u201clittle green men\u201d \u2013 the recently adopted term for men in uniforms with no insignia who appeared in key areas of Ukraine as rebels fought with government troops. The assumption among many is that the unidentified soldiers are Russian troops detailed for unofficial duty in Ukraine.\n\nEstonia officials told Western media that in the immediate aftermath of the incident, Estonian and Russian border guards met and surveyed the site, determining that a number of men had crossed the border from Russia, and that blast marks from a smoke or flash-bang grenade were found on the Estonian side. That has not been confirmed by Russia.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Estonia, the small NATO country President Obama last week said that the United States is bound by treaty to protect, claims Russia has violated its border and kidnapped an officer of its internal security service.
