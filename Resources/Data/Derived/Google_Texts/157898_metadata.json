The coaching staff had been overhauled, the list of questions seemed to grow by the day and the expectations set as high as ever.\n\nThe fire Elway had long sought and expected from his teams had been doused. A number of key players left in free agency soon after, prompting Elway to revamp and restructure. He went to work making a handful of smaller, less expensive deals that, although unheralded at the time, have become vital in reshaping the Broncos\u2019 defense.\n\nA Hall of Fame quarterback who\u2019s considered the greatest player in Broncos history, Elway led the franchise to five Super Bowl appearances. But since moving to the front office in 2011 he has left, arguably, a greater mark on the defensive side of the ball.\n\nThrough the draft and free agency, he has taken flyers on players other NFL teams passed over or discarded. He has spent big on stars but also developed up-and-comers. He has, in four years, built a defense that could end up as the franchise\u2019s finest ever, all while some of his high-round offensive draft selections (namely running back Montee Ball and wide receiver Cody Latimer) have floundered.\n\nGRAPHIC: How the 2015 Broncos defense was built\n\nThrough six games, the Denver defense has scored four touchdowns, amassed league highs in takeaways (17) and sacks (26), and allowed only 281.3 yards per game. It has not only prevented defeats but won games, filling in for an offense that has lacked rhythm and consistency \u2014 rarities on a Peyton Manning-led team.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what we want to be,\u201d cornerback Chris Harris said. \u201cI remember watching \u2018Monday Night Football Countdown\u2019 and hearing (ESPN\u2019s) Ray Lewis say that we\u2019re just good, we\u2019re not great. That\u2019s something that motivates us on the defense, to be great. We want to go down as one of the top defenses ever.\u201d\n\nConstruction of this group didn\u2019t come without criticism and risks. And it wasn\u2019t erected overnight.\n\nHarris a super acquisition\n\nElway laid the foundation four months into his tenure as executive vice president of football operations when he used the No. 2 overall pick in the 2011 draft on Von Miller, a Butkus Award winner from Texas A&M whose pass-rushing skills and physical gifts would help turn around a defense that ranked as the league\u2019s worst in total yards (6,253) and points allowed per game (29.4) the previous season.\n\nBut it was a move after the draft, that July, that ranks among Elway\u2019s finest. He took a chance on Harris, an undrafted cornerback out of Kansas. Harris signed with the Broncos as a free agent, and used Champ Bailey as a mentor before turning into the leader of the secondary. Harris hasn\u2019t allowed a touchdown in coverage since Nov. 24, 2013.\n\nElway then went to work rounding out the front seven, finding gems low in the draft and developing others with the help of veterans. Defensive end Derek Wolfe came first, selected in the second round of the 2012 draft at No. 36. End Malik Jackson, one of the Broncos\u2019 most efficient defenders, was taken in the fifth round (No. 137). Danny Trevathan, a linebacker out of Kentucky who had drawn comparisons to Wesley Woodyard in college, was selected in the sixth round (No. 188), with a pick Denver received from the Jets as part of the Tim Tebow trade a month earlier.\n\nIn 2013 the Broncos welcomed defensive tackles Terrance Knighton (free agency) and Sylvester Williams (draft) \u2014 the former helping to turn the latter into the defense\u2019s anchor at nose tackle before leaving in free agency this past March. That year also marked the arrival of Brandon Marshall, a linebacker tossed aside by the Jaguars. Initially signed to the Broncos\u2019 practice squad, Marshall was promoted when Miller went down with a knee injury late that season and has since turned into the quarterback of the defense, calling out plays and leading the defense in tackles last season (110) and this season (48).\n\nBut the biggest and most expensive defensive installments were saved for 2014, when, in the span of 24 hours that March, Elway doled out $110 million for cornerback Aqib Talib, safety T.J. Ward and defensive end DeMarcus Ware. Two months later, Elway took another gamble, on Bradley Roby, a cornerback out of Ohio State whose draft stock fell because of an off-field incident but someone who has been a valued contributor as a nickel back.\n\nSmaller moves were also made that would prove beneficial to this defense down the road. A Colorado State linebacker named Shaquil Barrett was among the Broncos\u2019 15 undrafted free agents signed that May. Barrett has 3\u00bd sacks and a team-high three forced fumbles this season.\n\n\u201cWhen I first came in, Quinton Carter, my fellow Las Vegas native, he told me, \u2018Man, just keep working hard. They\u2019re going to give you opportunities,\u2019 \u201d Marshall said. \u201cAnd I saw and they did. This organization gives guys opportunities. Look at Shaq. He got his opportunity and now he\u2019s doing well.\u201d\n\nWelcome back, Wade\n\nThe finishing touches for this Denver defense came this past offseason. The line was bolstered by veteran free agents Vance Walker and Antonio Smith. The linebackers got yet another pass rusher in first-round pick Shane Ray, whom Elway traded up to select at No. 23. The secondary found its missing piece in safety Darian Stewart.\n\nBut the glue to bind it all was signed off the street: Wade Phillips was brought back as defensive coordinator when the Bengals refused to let Vance Joseph interview. Phillips has turned a good defense into the league\u2019s best after scrapping Jack Del Rio\u2019s 4-3 alignment and installing his version of the 3-4.\n\nPhillips turned loose a blitzing, quarterback-swarming attack.\n\nThe Broncos rank third in the NFL in opponent quarterback rating (58.9) when blitzing in passing situations. They are the only team to have kept opponents scoreless in the first quarter of every game. And they rank among the top five in the league in several categories, including total defense (281.3 yards allowed per game, No. 2), scoring (17 points per game, No. 4), third-down percentage (.316, No. 2), sacks (26, No. 1) and interceptions (nine, No. 2).\n\nThe defense has taken the spotlight. And it was Elway, a man remembered for The Drive and The Helicopter and his pair of gleaming Super Bowl title rings as a quarterback, who signed off on the group that is turning heads with its depth, pick-sixes, sacks and game-winning plays.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s just being John Elway,\u201d Miller said. \u201cEvery year I\u2019ve felt like we\u2019ve had the perfect pieces. This year is no different, but I feel like this is our best team.\u201d\n\nNicki Jhabvala: njhabvala@denverpost.com or @NickiJhabvala", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "How John Elway, a former quarterback, constructed one of the Broncos\u2019 best defenses", "title": "How John Elway, a former quarterback, constructed one of the Broncos\u2019 best defenses", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/10/24/how-john-elway-a-former-quarterback-constructed-one-of-the-broncos-best-defenses/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151006_105715_denver-broncos-defense-3.jpg", "height": 473}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151006_105715_denver-broncos-defense-3.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-10-24T20:14:26+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-21T11:55:57+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "He went to work making a handful of smaller, less expensive deals that, although unheralded at the time, have become vital in reshaping the Broncos\u2019 defense.\nA Hall of Fame quarterback who\u2019s considered the greatest player in Broncos history, Elway led the franchise to five Super Bowl appearances.\nThrough the draft and free agency, he has taken flyers on players other NFL teams passed over or discarded.\nA Colorado State linebacker named Shaquil Barrett was among the Broncos\u2019 15 undrafted free agents signed that May.\nA number of key players left in free agency soon after, prompting Elway to revamp and restructure."}
