Hardly. \u201cHas there been any soul-searching among the prophets of California doom, asking why they were so wrong?\u201d he asks. \u201cNot that I\u2019m aware of. Instead, I\u2019ve been seeing many attempts to devalue the good news from California by pointing out that the state\u2019s job growth still lags that of Texas, which is true, and claiming that this difference is driven by differential tax rates, which isn\u2019t.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The New York Times columnist explains how California's success puts conservative dogma to shame", "title": "Paul Krugman: California proves the GOP\u2019s \u201cextremist ideology \u2026 is nonsense\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The New York Times columnist explains how California's success puts conservative dogma to shame", "title": "Paul Krugman: California proves the GOP\u2019s \u201cextremist ideology \u2026 is nonsense\u201d", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/07/25/paul_krugman_california_proves_the_gops_extremist_ideology_is_nonsense/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/11/paul_krugman2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The New York Times columnist explains how California's success puts conservative dogma to shame", "title": "Paul Krugman: California proves the GOP\u2019s \u201cextremist ideology \u2026 is nonsense\u201d", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/11/paul_krugman2.jpg", "creator": "@eliasisquith", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Elias Isquith", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, California, Conservatives, Economics, Editor's Picks, GOP, jerry brown, Kansas, Paul Krugman, Republican Party, supply-side, Tax, Texas, The New York Times", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "\u201cIf tax increases are causing a major flight of jobs from California, you can\u2019t see it in the job numbers,\u201d Krugman writes.\n\u201cHas there been any soul-searching among the prophets of California doom, asking why they were so wrong?\u201d he asks.\nInstead, I\u2019ve been seeing many attempts to devalue the good news from California by pointing out that the state\u2019s job growth still lags that of Texas, which is true, and claiming that this difference is driven by differential tax rates, which isn\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cNot that I\u2019m aware of.\n\u201cEmployment is up 3.6 percent in the past 18 months, compared with a national average of 2.8 percent; at this point, California\u2019s share of national employment, which was hit hard by the bursting of the state\u2019s enormous housing bubble, is back to pre-recession levels.\u201dDoes Krugman expect the California example to change conservatives\u2019 minds?"}
