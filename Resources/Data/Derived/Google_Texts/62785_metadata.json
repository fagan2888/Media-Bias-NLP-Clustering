The first was in 2000.\n\n\"We're going to see about 5,000 people with two items each, so about 10,000,\" said Bemko. From that, we're going to make three episodes of television.\"\n\nBehind the cameras and lines were the stories.\n\n\"These are Japanese police swords that my father brought back from Japan,\" said Frank from North Carolina. \"He was in World War II.\"\n\n\"We came to see if Toby is a real stife,\" said Robin, from Florida, showing off her teddy bear. \"And, he is. He's circa 1910. He was my Great Aunt Mary's.\"\n\nSome items brought back fond childhood memories.\n\n\"We used them on the farm as play toys,\" said Frank, smiling at his swords.\n\nTo many, the sentimental value far outweighed the retail value.\n\n\"I had a conversation with him and explained he'd be staying with us anyways so it didn't really matter,\" said Robin, hugging her teddy bear that was appraised at $5,000.\n\nPeople traveled from across the country, bringing items of all kinds.\n\nBut the number one antique seen were paintings.\n\nSome were shocked to find the monetary worth of their items, while others expected more.\n\nBemko said in show's 20 years, they've seen hundreds of thousands of pieces with character, but there seems to be one common theme.\n\n\"No matter how good it is, they usually do not ever sell it,\" says Bemko.\n\nBecause, often times, the item tells a story that money can't buy.\n\nThe Antique Roadshow Charleston episodes will air sometime this year on ETV.\n\nAntique Roadshow is on every Monday night at 8pm.\n\nThere will be a separate show called \"Junk in the Trunk\" from Charleston that will air sometime in 2016.\n\nCopyright 2015 WCSC.
