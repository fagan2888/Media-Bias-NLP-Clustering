The Medical Examiner has now ruled the death of an Oklahoma City woman a homicide. Police say Maria Gonzales collapsed after a domestic incident with her boyfriend.

Police responded to a welfare call at 3212 SE 56th on May 4th. When officers arrived on scene they found an EMSA personnel performing CPR on Gonzales. Police say Gonalzes was in a physical fight with her boyfriend when she suddenly collapsed.

She was taken to the hospital, where she died four days later on May 8th.

The Medical Examiner says Gonzales was pregnant and had heart disease which was aggravated by the fight.



Police have not made any arrests in this case. Police will present the case to the district attorney's office, who will determine what charges, if any, will be filed.
