(AP) - Roaring into its second year of operation at the new location, Top of the Lake Snowmobile Museum in Naubinway is deriving tremendous benefit from moving to its new location.\n\n\u201cWe have 80 different brands of snowmobiles here,\u201d said John Batchelder, adding there are approximately 140 different displays.\n\nThe museum\u2019s oldest machine, a 1936 Westendorf, was built by a Bay City man to fit in the back of his Model T truck for ice fishing, according to The Evening News (http://bit.ly/1wM42fl ). The fastest machine currently on display is described as a Boss Cat III, designed for drag racing, which posted a top speed of 128 mph. This addition, in the ever-changing rotation of displays, recently replaced the previous fastest machine - Miss Budweiser - that reached 201 mph in 1990.\n\nThe 1969 I-500 machine piloted by Dan Planck when he captured the flag in the inaugural running of snowmobile\u2019s biggest race is featured in the racing section.\n\nThe Timberwolf, one of only eight produced, was built in Sault Ste. Marie by Dick Zabelka and Dr. Tom Robinson.\n\n\u201cWe can account for four of them,\u201d said Charlie Vallier while conducting a tour of the museum. \u201cWe have two; one was crushed and another was burned up in a fire. There are four of them missing and we would love to know where they are.\u201d\n\nOf the old machines represented, many are one-of-a-kind creations - either special prototypes or homemade machines by barnyard engineers. But the museum\u2019s rich history reveals that many big manufacturers - Evinrude, Johnson, Mercury, John Deere and Harley-Davidson - also entered into the booming snowmobile market as their popularity caught on with the general public.\n\nOf all the manufacturers, only four still survive: Arctic Cat, Polaris, Ski-Doo and Yamaha.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking for the unique sleds that have a history,\u201d said Vallier, noting there is waiting list to get even worthy machines on display as the snowmobile collectors from near and far are more than willing to put their machines on loan to be included in the museum.\n\n\u201cWe have plenty of machines to add on,\u201d said Vallier with one eye on the future and a second on the finances, \u201cbut we\u2019ll pay for this first.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are other museums out there,\u201d said Batchelder, admitting Top of the Lake might not be the biggest, \u201cbut we are about the history of snowmobiling - here we have all brands and the memorabilia along with it.\u201d\n\nThe move to the site just off of US-2, made in October 2013, has paid great dividends in the form of increased traffic. Vehicular traffic through the prime summer tourist season was drawn to the site due to the close proximity of the main east to west artery, both men explained. And Trail No. 2, which connects Drummond Island to Calumet, draws snowmobile traffic in the winter months.\n\n\u201cSometimes there won\u2019t be a vehicle in the parking lot,\u201d said Batchelder, \u201cbut we\u2019ll have a dozen or more snowmobiles.\u201d\n\nVallier added that on cold days the riders like to come in, have a hot cocoa or chocolate in the conference room to warm up and then tour the heated facility. Maybe even, Vallier added, warm their feet by the fireplace.\n\nThe Top of the Lake Museum is open seven days a week from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Evening News, http://www.sooeveningnews.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "Roaring into its second year of operation at the new location, Top of the Lake Snowmobile Museum in Naubinway is deriving tremendous benefit from moving to its new location.", "Author": "SCOTT BRAND", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Roaring into its second year of operation at the new location, Top of the Lake Snowmobile Museum in Naubinway is deriving tremendous benefit from moving to its new location.", "title": "Naubinway snowmobile museum features historic, unique sleds", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/dec/22/naubinway-snowmobile-museum-features-historic-uniq/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/12/22/0fbb958021cee932680f6a706700f4df.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/12/22/0fbb958021cee932680f6a706700f4df.jpg", "title": "Naubinway snowmobile museum features historic, unique sleds", "description": "Roaring into its second year of operation at the new location, Top of the Lake Snowmobile Museum in Naubinway is deriving tremendous benefit from moving to its new location.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0191\"", "article_summary": "NAUBINWAY, Mich.
