Kate McKinnon’s interpretation of Hillary Clinton on this week’s episode of “Saturday Night Live” might just be her best — and most accurate — yet.

In the sketch, “Hillary” crashes a variety of summer activities — from a summer picnic to a sand-castle construction — and hilariously attempts to appeal to young voters despite the fact that the admits to find summer “tedious.”

“My last vacation was in 1953,” she tells a group of picnickers. “I played one round of hopscotch with a friend. I found it tedious. I mean, why hop when you can march — straight to the White House.”

When Hillary confronts a group of young surfers, she attempts to shrug off her old age and cast her 67-year-old self as in-touch with Millennial voters.

“Hey there, 18-to-25-year-olds. How does it all hang?” she says awkwardly. “Fun fact about summer: You know [fellow Democratic presidential candidate] Bernie Sanders? This is his 73rd one. I guess the old age thing is his narrative now.”

“In two years, I’ll be 69,” Hillary adds. “Do you like that? Bill told me to tell that to young males.”

Later on in the sketch, one pair of children on the beach tell Hillary plainly of their parents, “They don’t like you.”

Bill even makes an appearance to rub sunscreen on a young woman.
