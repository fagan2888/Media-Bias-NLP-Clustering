A scarcity of educators produces constant strain. Burnout threatens the very newest nurses. But innovative educational and practice options could help Iowa and its health care system meet the increasing demands on this essential caregiving profession.\n\nMORE COVERAGE:About 100 Great Nurses | Gender divide apparent\n\nNURSE PROFILES: Adam Haut | Barbara Bybee | Sheri Allen | Rebecca Cherry | Sally Yungtum | Brandon Nickerson | Dea Murray |Jennifer Fehrer | Deena McAndrew\n\nThe Schools\n\nNursing, says Murphy-Barstad, might just be in her blood: Multiple cousins have their bachelor's degrees in nursing, her maternal grandmother trained for a time as a nurse, and another great-great-grandmother was a midwife.\n\n\"There was really never a question that I would do anything else with my life,\" says Murphy-Barstad, who earned her bachelor's in nursing at Creighton University in Omaha. \"The physiology of the human body is pretty fascinating. I liked that I didn't have to devote as much time to schooling as if I had become a physician. I loved the idea of mixing science with the art of service to others.\"\n\nThe U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics lists \"registered nurse\" as among the top job occupations for growth through 2022 \u2014 an increase of 19 percent. \"If you look across the country, there are places that already experiencing some shortages, although Iowa is not among them,\" says Rita Frantz, dean of the University of Iowa College of Nursing.\n\nWhat Iowa is short on are the people qualified and willing to teach nursing. It is at nursing schools that the pressures of the changing profession and the state's aging demographics are felt most acutely, say experts.\n\n\"One of the biggest barriers to increasing our workforce is the shortage of nursing faculty,\" says Frantz. \"There are large numbers of qualified candidates or applicants that aren't able to be accepted\" \u2014 80,000 nationwide last year, according to the American Association of Colleges of Nursing \u2014 \"because schools of nursing are short on faculty.\"\n\nThe reasons are many and varied: Many teaching positions may require an advanced degree, such as a Ph.D.; the pay is much less in academia than it is in practice. \"Right now, my assistant professors earn less than a new graduate starting as a nurse practitioner, and that's a big concern,\" says Frantz.\n\nIn about a decade, that education shortage could get much worse: The average age of nursing professors, says Frantz, is about 60. \"There are a huge number of these people that are on the cusp of retirement \u2014 50 percent could retire any time now,\" she says.\n\nThe Clinic\n\nBrock attended Luther College for three years as an elementary education major before transferring to Mercy College of Health Sciences in Des Moines, where she completed her bachelor's of nursing degree; she's also board-certified in geriatrics. Although her classroom work was necessary, it was her educational preceptorship that made the most impact.\n\n\"A preceptorship is when you are assigned to work with a real nurse for a certain amount of time,\" says Brock. \"You work their schedule with them and the idea is that by the end, you're taking care of their patient load independently. This is definitely where I learned the most.\"\n\nBut the time when nurses leave the classroom and enter the clinic for practical education has its own constraints. The Iowa Board of Nursing-required faculty-to-student ratio in a clinical unit is 1-to-8. \"That same situation is faced by every school of nursing, and that's where the faculty needs are the greatest,\" says Frantz.\n\nAt that key transition from classroom to clinical experience, educators and practitioners have come together to address shortages on both sides of the profession. For example, there are innovative revenue-generating options that may allow nurse practitioners to teach and practice concurrently in order to help to boost salaries. Dedicated education units also allow experienced nursing staff to take on student mentoring in clinical settings, which in turn enable schools to stretch teaching capabilities.\n\nFor nurses looking to advance their education \u2014 which can lead to increased salaries \u2014 there are more options, too. For example, at the University of Iowa, graduate degrees \u2014 which allow nurses to become nurse practitioners \u2014 pave the way for doctoral degrees, which in turn qualify nurses for faculty positions. Curriculums available for registered nurses, says Kathleen Weinberg, executive director of the Iowa Board of Nursing, enable them \"to pursue their higher education right where they work. And nursing education programs are working to make the educational transition more seamless.\"\n\nThe Burnout\n\nAfter Murphy-Barstad graduated in 1994, she joined Mercy Medical Center in Des Moines as a medical-surgical staff nurse, where she specialized in renal, urology, transplants, plastics, burns, reconstructive surgery, and traumas. Three years later, after 12-hour shifts and consistent staffing shortages, she left for a position in public health with more regular hours.\n\nLuckily, the nursing profession didn't lose Murphy-Barstad \u2014 but it does lose young nurses. \"As many as 30 percent of nurses will leave their first employment within the first year,\" Frantz says.\n\nMentorship \u2014 both during the classroom and during those first few years of clinical practice \u2014 is key. \"Students come into the profession and are not always prepared for the ongoing experience that they need,\" says Judy Collins, president of the Iowa Nurses Association. \"We're working hard to change that.\"\n\nOnline activities are one option for support, and are sometimes used to provide educational opportunities in areas that may be underrepresented in the classroom. Collins, for example, has offered online continuing education in play therapy, a skill not many may require but that some may use.\n\nEven with built-in support, says Frantz, nurses are under tremendous stress when they go into their first job. A study by Peter Buerhaus at Vanderbilt University found that for 75 percent of resident nurses, the profession presents quality-of-life issues, which can lead to quality-of-care issues.\n\nFindings like that were part of the impetus behind the creation of the statewide Nurse Residency Program in 2014. Based out of the University of Iowa, the program was a response to research that recommended ways to advance the profession, provide high-quality health care, and make better use of the nursing workforce.\n\nThe program, says Frantz, is available to any employer of nurses in the country, but may be most vital to those that don't have the infrastructure or resources \u2014 nursing homes, private clinics, for example \u2014 to create an in-house residency program. All nursing graduates in their first job can use the 12-month program to help assist in the transition from a more structured environment in a clinical setting to practice. The enrollment of 254 nurses stretches across nine states. In Iowa, 24 hospitals \u2014 predominantly rural access facilities, says Frantz \u2014 have used the program.\n\nIt's another good step, experts agree. \"We will never be able to keep up if you have high turnover and people retiring,\" says Frantz. \"We need to increase enrollment, to have creative partnerships, and to ensure people who graduate are able to make the transition and be successful and stay and continue to work.\"\n\nThe Shortage\n\nBrock spent about five years working on the telemetry floor \u2014 cardiac and pulmonary patients \u2014 of Mercy; by the time she left for a neurosurgery clinic she was considered a long-timer. \"Nurses had to work every other holiday and every third weekend,\" says Brock. \"It was difficult to stay on the telemetry floor for as long as I did because we were always short-staffed and the patients required a lot of care that we often didn't have time to give.\"\n\nAlthough she makes less money now, her job is easier \u2014 no weekends, no holidays \u2014 and she hasn't lost the rush she gets when a patient calls, scared or worried, and she can make them feel better. \"Nurses are responsible for translating what doctors say into something that patients can understand. It feels good to have the knowledge to be able to that,\" she says.\n\nBut the stress Brock felt in her first job isn't going to go away for most nurses anytime soon. The U.S. population is aging: By 2030 there will be about 72.1 million older persons, according to the Administration on Aging, more than twice what there were in 2000. And the Affordable Care Act brought many more people into clinical settings that previously didn't have ways to pay for health care.\n\nIowa's nurses are aging, too, which will speed up the shortage: 46 percent of the state's nurses are 50 years of age or older. \"That's a statistic that's close to the national statistic,\" says Frantz. \"In 2013, 55 percent of the registered nurse workforce was age 50 or older.\"\n\nIowa's nurses make significantly less, too, than their counterparts in other states, and not only as professionals advance up the education ladder. Part of that, says Collins, is that Iowa's Medicaid reimbursement is lower than elsewhere, and Iowa's nursing salaries are some of the lowest in the United States. \"It doesn't have anything to do with skills or hospitals,\" says Collins. \"We offer very high-quality and low-cost hospitals. We're trying to change some of those things as we go into different national reimbursement.\"\n\nThe state's current crop of nurses \u2014 including those recognized by the 11-year-old 100 Great Iowa Nurses program \u2014 show the promise of the future for the profession's indispensable work.\n\n\"Nursing is so unique in that there are so many different kinds of jobs we can do. We can work in hospitals, clinics, and schools. We can be occupational nurses, work comp case managers, and representatives for medical equipment companies. The list is almost endless,\" says Brock. \"Nurses are cool.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: http://dmreg.co/1I5bPeB", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "The state of nursing in Iowa, including projected professional shortages and too few educators, has spurred some groundbreaking solutions.
