(WISH) \u2014 A number of puppies found neglected with the Parvovirus are recovering thanks to community support.\n\nIn Katie Trennepohl\u2019s home video, her three foster puppies romp around, playing like puppies so often do.\n\n\u201cThey are starting to feel a little bit better, starting to act a little bit more like puppies,\u201d said Trennepohl.\n\nIt\u2019s a far cry from when she got them yesterday.\n\n\u201cFirst one I picked up had her head in the water bowl. She didn\u2019t even have the energy to move her head out of it after she had gotten a drink,\u201d said Trennepohl\n\nIt was a case of animal neglect.\n\nIndianapolis Animal Care and Control found a house with 21 puppies, all exposed to the Parvovirus; a highly contagious and often fatal disease.\n\nRebecca Stevens with the Humane Society for Hamilton County took in 13 of them.\n\n\u201cI would definitely call this a hoarding situation and, as with most hoarders, they go into it with the best of intentions and my understanding is this particular individual was trying to rescue puppies that she was finding on Craigslist,\u201d said Stevens.\n\nWithout vaccinations, it only took one puppy to contract the disease before it spread.\n\nIn all, four died so far.\n\nBut thanks to the Humane Society of Hamilton County and Lucky Dog Rescue, most of the puppies are being given a second chance.\n\n\u201cThis morning they were up and wagging their tail. One was actually coming to me seeking attention, wanting to be petted, which is a big step from yesterday when they didn\u2019t even want to pick up their heads,\u201d said Trennepohl. .\n\nThe Humane Society for Hamilton County is accepting donations at its website to help with the treatment of the puppies.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nGoogle\n\nEmail\n\nPrint\n\nMore\n\nPinterest\n\nLike this: Like Loading...", "article_metadata": {"description": "\u201cFirst one I picked up had her head in the water bowl.
