Phil Roe of Tennessee \u2013 would prevent the rule, which was released by the administration in its final form in early-April, from being implemented.\n\n\u201cBureaucrats in Washington, D.C. have no business getting between you and your financial planner. But that\u2019s what the Obama administration\u2019s fiduciary rule does. It\u2019s Obamacare for financial planning,\u201d House Speaker Paul Ryan said in a statement. \u201cThat\u2019s why the House has exercised its powers under the Congressional Review Act to reject the administration\u2019s onerous rule. I commend Reps. Roe, Boustany, and Wagner for working to protect middle-class families and small businesses trying to plan for the future.\u201d\n\nA group of GOP Senators recently introduced the counterpart to the resolution in the upper chamber.\n\nFollow Juliegrace Brufke on Twitter\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
