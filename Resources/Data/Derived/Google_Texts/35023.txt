CINCINNATI (AP) — Bengals captain Andrew Whitworth got permission to attend rookie camp on Saturday and mentor the linemen who were taken in the draft. He also spent some time on the sideline clarifying his remarks to ownership.

The 10th-year veteran talked to owner Mike Brown and other members of his family about comments expressing frustration over his uncertain status with the team. Whitworth was upbeat as he left the field when practice ended.

“I think they know that I love this place and I want to be here, and they know what I am to this organization and I know what they are to me,” said Whitworth, with his 4-year-old and 3-year-old sons following him around. “They’ve been great to me and my family. So there’s nothing but mutual appreciation there, there’s no doubt about that.”

Whitworth was surprised when the Bengals took offensive tackles — Cedric Ogbuehi and Jake Fisher — with their first two picks in the draft. The team captain has been trying to get an idea of where he fits in the Bengals’ plans beyond this season, his last under contract, but no one had been willing to discuss it with him.

On Monday, Whitworth expressed his frustration over the team’s silence about his future. He also said the uncertainty made it more difficult for him to be a team leader. A few days later, a tongue-in-cheek tweet was accidentally sent on his account suggesting that Mike Brown was getting rid of him. The tweet was quickly deleted.
