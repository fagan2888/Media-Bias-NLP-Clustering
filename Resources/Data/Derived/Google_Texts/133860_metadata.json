(October 1, 2015) \u2014 Twenty years ago, on October 1, 1995, 180,000 low-income Orange County residents became the first members of CalOptima, a new managed care system for Medi-Cal. At the time, CalOptima was created as a local solution to fix the crisis in access to Medi-Cal services that was causing overcrowded emergency rooms and unnecessary costs.\n\nTwo decades have transformed CalOptima into a statewide model of quality\n\nand efficiency for a membership of more than 750,000. This past month,\n\nCalOptima received an overall quality rating of 4 out of 5 in the National\n\nCommittee for Quality Assurance\u2019s Medicaid Health Insurance Plan Ratings 2015\u20132016. This is the second year in a row that CalOptima is the leader in California among NCQA-reviewed plans. CalOptima also leads in cost-effectiveness, with an administrative cost ratio of 3.98 percent, the lowest among county organized health systems in California for 2014. Keeping administrative costs low means CalOptima can spend more money on health care services for members.\n\n\u201cCalOptima draws strength from our community and provider partnerships developed over 20 years,\u201d says Michael Schrader, Chief Executive Officer. \u201cSince 1995, CalOptima members have had access to thousands of quality health care providers through a locally controlled, public-private partnership. Our public agency together with the private health networks share the goal of improving health in Orange County, which has enabled us to reach this anniversary milestone.\u201d\n\nIn recognition of the 20th anniversary, CalOptima plans a yearlong celebration. The main event will be a Health and Wellness Community Event next month at CalOptima\u2019s offices in Orange. Members and the community are invited to attend to receive health screenings, wellness information, family resources and more. The event will also feature cultural entertainment that reflects CalOptima\u2019s diversity.\n\n\u2013more\u2013", "article_metadata": {"description": "Press Releases Voice of OC posts press releases as a way of providing readers with information directly from businesses, cities, county and state agencies, political organizations and nonprofits.
