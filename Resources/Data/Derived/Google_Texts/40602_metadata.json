And here\u2019s one way to put that in perspective: In just six months between late 2013 and early 2014, the nation\u2019s persistently high uninsured rate fell by a staggering 25%.\n\nSo does this mean that the nation\u2019s already busy emergency departments are about to bust at the seams, as some Obamacare critics suggest? That states still nixing the Medicaid expansion are right to worry it would overcrowd their hospitals?\n\nNot necessarily, says UCLA\u2019s Gerald Kominski.\n\nKominski, director of UCLA\u2019s Center for Health Policy Research, and colleagues looked at what happened when hundreds of thousands of Californians signed up for a proto-version of Obamacare: the Low Income Health Plan, better known as the LIHP. And UCLA\u2019s new study \u2014 released on Wednesday \u2014 tracks nearly 200,000 enrollees in the LIHP between 2011 and 2013.\n\nSo while we can\u2019t yet know the fates of the millions of Americans newly covered through the ACA, we do know what happened when hundreds of thousands of Californians got covered through the LIHP: Many rushed to get treatment for unmet medical needs, driving up utilization \u2026 and then resumed more normal patterns.\n\n\u201cWe see an increase in utilization in the first year, and especially in the first few months,\u201d Kominski tells California Healthline. \u201cBut then there\u2019s a dramatic drop-off.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think our results clearly show that this a temporary, not permanent phenomenon.\u201d\n\nCoverage Expansion, Closely Studied\n\nThe ACA\u2019s transforming the nation\u2019s health system. Providers\u2019 uncompensated care is plunging. States\u2019 Medicaid programs are growing.\n\nBut the law\u2019s also helped catalyze the health policy landscape, pushing researchers to dig into some hugely important policy questions.\n\nNamely, if you give someone health insurance, does that person really get healthier? How many lives might the Medicaid expansion actually save?\n\nRecent studies have attempted to find solutions. \u201cAll of those questions still exist, because each expansion has its own context,\u201d says Harvard\u2019s Ben Sommers, who led some of this research. But we\u2019re starting to get answers, he suggests.\n\nFor instance, the notion that having health insurance has no positive health effects has been increasingly debunked. \u201cThat has become a weaker and weaker argument,\u201d Sommers says.\n\n\u201cThe argument that providing health insurance provides no health benefit \u2026 my response to that is anyone who [still] thinks that\u2019s true should voluntarily go uninsured for the next five years,\u201d Kominski adds. \u201cI\u2019d love them to report back to me how that worked out.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, there are still major, open questions about how coverage expansion affects health spending and consumer utilization. For now, many in the policy community are looking to the influential Oregon Health Insurance Experiment for data, given that study\u2019s unique construction as a randomized controlled trial. In one major development, researchers this year suggested that Medicaid expansion in Oregon had led to a surge in ED visits.\n\nThe findings from the Oregon study have helped some states pause on opting into the ACA\u2019s Medicaid expansion. And while the findings may not be totally generalizable to other states, they\u2019re a good reminder that coverage expansion doesn\u2019t necessarily save money or come with no costs \u2014 a persistent myth championed by supporters of the health law, researchers note.\n\n\u201cWhen you give people coverage, they use more health services,\u201d Sommers notes. \u201cAnd sometimes they use the things we don\u2019t want them to use.\u201d\n\nThe Oregon research is \u201cexcellent,\u201d Kominski agrees. But \u201cI think the Oregon study, in a sense, has been the outlier. It calls into question some other studies, because it doesn\u2019t show across-the-board positive benefits.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I think our study is particularly interesting,\u201d Kominski adds. \u201cIt\u2019s not directly comparable to the Oregon Health Insurance Experiment \u2014 [but] it provides a different view of looking at the issue.\u201d\n\nWhat the LIHP Shows Us\n\nIn their study, UCLA researchers separated the new LIHP enrollees into four distinct groups, based on their expected pent-up demand. (In some cases, the newly enrolled individuals had used county indigent services, or had been covered by another low-income health coverage program, or both. These enrollees were expected to have less pent-up demand for care, because they\u2019d been using health services.)\n\nAnd in the most striking finding, the UCLA researchers determined that patients with the highest expected pent-up demand \u2014 the LIHP enrollees who had lacked health coverage and hadn\u2019t previously sought out medical care \u2014 visited the ED at a rate of about 600 visits per 1,000 people in the first three months after receiving LIHP coverage.\n\nBut within the year, the rate of ED visits for this group had slowed, before stabilizing at about one-third the earlier level. Essentially, these patients been putting off their pent-up health care needs, Kominski says, and once those demands were met, they began using the health care system at a more normal level, closer to what was seen among the other LIHP enrollees.\n\nThe researchers found a similar spike-and-slowdown with inpatient utilization, too.\n\n\u201cWe think that this is a good indication of what happens under the Medi-Cal expansion, because this is the Medi-Cal population,\u201d Kominski says.\n\nAnd what that means moving forward, he argues, is that the Medi-Cal program isn\u2019t going to experience that pent-up demand \u2014 at least for the hundreds of thousands of Californians who were enrolled in the LIHP program, because they\u2019ve already had a chance to get treatment.\n\n\u201cThe findings are really good news for the state of California,\u201d Kominski says. \u201cAnd it\u2019s good news for society\u2019s perspective, too.\u201d\n\nAround the nation\n\nHere\u2019s what else is making news on the road to reform.\n\nOhio\u2019s Medicaid expansion could be reversed. At Kaiser Health News, Sarah Jane Tribble explores the political hurdles still looming for Medicaid expansion in the Buckeye state: its conservative Legislature could roll back the expansion next year.\n\nCan you keep Kynect but kill Obamacare? Running for re-election in Kentucky, Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has argued that the state\u2019s popular health insurance exchange can live on even if the ACA is struck down. But that argument seems like a sleight of hand, John Dickerson writes for Slate.\n\nCan you keep the private option but kill Obamacare? McConnell\u2019s not alone in trying to thread the needle on the ACA in a Senate race. In Arkansas, Republican Senate candidate Tom Cotton has repeatedly affirmed his opposition to Obamacare, but danced around the issue of dropping the state\u2019s \u201cprivate option,\u201d David Ramsey reports for the Arkansas Times.", "article_metadata": {"description": "<p>California's Low Income Health Plan ended nearly a year ago.
