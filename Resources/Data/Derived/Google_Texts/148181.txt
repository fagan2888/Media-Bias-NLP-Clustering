Glenn Beck brought in a chilling piece of history Tuesday to explain why “governments should not be selling products” of any kind.

The conversation began with a discussion about a new book called “The Two Bite Club” developed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture to encourage children to eat according to “MyPlate” guidelines.

“I just happened to bring in [another] children’s book today … also about little kitty cats and a fox!” Beck began on his radio program. “It was published by a government … [But] the kitty cat and fox were teaching you not to trust the Jews.”

Beck said the book was put together by the Nazis, and that they’re not the only ones who tried to indoctrinate the youth.

“The communists do it, too!” he said.

Beck showed the book to his employees during their morning meeting:

Beck said that while “everyone” can agree that we want children to eat well, having the federal government involved in the publishing business is a “really, really dangerous step,” and something that Americans would have considered propaganda in the past.

As Beck sees it, “governments should not be selling products” at all, even if it’s only to encourage healthy eating habits.

Beck’s co-host Stu Burguiere added that he would include advertisements for Obamacare in that umbrella.

“You don’t need to advertise anything to me,” he declared. “These guys come out and brag they hit 7 million supposed people [who enrolled in Obamacare]. You mandated we have this insurance! And then you are spending my money advertising it to me, and you are bragging?”
