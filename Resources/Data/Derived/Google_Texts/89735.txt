Topeka police were looking for two women in connection with the Saturday morning holdup of a south-side payday loan business.

Officers were called at 10:48 a.m. to the Check Into Cash payday loan business at 3711 S.W. Plaza Drive.

Police said two women entered the business and asked to use the restroom.

One of the women was reported to have a weapon resembling a crowbar or club, while the other said she had a gun but didnâ€™t display it.

The women then robbed the employee and the business.

After taking cash, the women were reported to have fled the scene on foot, running north from the business into a nearby neighborhood.

Police units responded to the scene and ran a K-9 trail, but no arrests had been reported by Saturday afternoon.

The women were described as being of thin build and standing around 6-feet-tall. One was wearing gray sweatpants and a gray hoodie and sunglasses, while the other was wearing gray sweatpants and a white hoodie.

Anyone with information on the robbery may call police detectives at (785) 368-9400 or Crime Stoppers at (785) 234-0007.
