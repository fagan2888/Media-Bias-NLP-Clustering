(Katie Hiler / WNYC)\n\nAsk anyone living in the Ironbound neighborhood of Newark, and they\u2019ll tell you this tight-knit community in the northeast corner of the city has a small-town feel.\n\n\u201cSo you can see it's five minutes to three; schools going to be out in a few minutes. Lots of parents are here waiting for their kids,\u201d says Maria Irizarry. \u201cIt\u2019s a very sort of family oriented neighborhood.\u201d\n\nIrizarry grew up here, just a few blocks from the elementary school on Lafayette Street. The firehouse is located around the corner on Prospect. Saint James Hospital was just up the block.\n\nWhen Saint James shuttered its doors in 2008, it left the community\u2019s high number of uninsured residents without access to any primary care services.\n\nThen, last summer, Irizarry and a team of partners got approval to fill the void by opening a Federally Qualified Health Center. They decided to call it Saint James Health.\n\nFQHCs have been a staple of low-income communities across the country for over 30 years now. Their mission is to serve Medicaid and uninsured patients that other doctors won't see.\n\nBut at the same time the effects of another change in health care rippled through the neighborhood: the Affordable Care Act dramatically increased the number of people covered by Medicaid. This has put the federal centers in a tough financial spot. Not only are there fewer uninsured to serve but also more primary care doctors have stepped in to compete with centers for new Medicaid patients.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been in practice 35 years, and only in the last few years did I start to take Medicaid,\u201d says Dr. Lawrence Armenti, a self-described old-school physician in the Ironbound. He still makes house calls.\n\n\u201cEspecially some of my patients who were paying me cash before, and now they have insurance. And so I felt compelled to say \u2018Ok, I\u2019ll take your insurance,\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nWith another well-funded competitor, Newark Community Health Centers, planning to move in, it\u2019s an uphill battle for a new FQHC like Saint James Health to survive in a post-Obamacare world.\n\nStill, Irizarry remained confident. To offset a dip in their once-traditional patients, she's looking to attract those with commercial insurance.\n\n\u201cWe created a five-star facility. It\u2019s a beautiful place. We give healthcare to anybody that needs it,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The\u00a0Ironbound neighborhood of Newark, N.J., is seeing more primary-care options pop up as more of its\u00a0residents receive\u00a0health insurance.", "og": {"site_name": "WNYC", "description": "The\u00a0Ironbound neighborhood of Newark, N.J., is seeing more primary-care options pop up as more of its\u00a0residents receive\u00a0health insurance.", "title": "As Patients Get Insured, Newark Health Clinics Face New Competition", "url": "http://www.wnyc.org/story/patients-get-insured-newark-health-clinics-face-new-competition/?utm_source=sharedUrl&utm_medium=metatag&utm_campaign=sharedUrl", "image": "https://media2.wnyc.org/i/1200/627/c/80/1/Ironbound_Hiler.jpg", "video": {"width": 200, "identifier": "http://www.wnyc.org/media/audioplayer/facebook_embed.swf?file=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wnyc.org%2Faudio%2Fxspf%2F588049%2F&autostart=true", "type": "application/x-shockwave-flash", "height": 29}, "type": "video.episode"}, "is_article": "True", "twitter": {"app": {"id": {"iphone": 470219771, "googleplay": "org.wnyc.android"}}, "image": "https://media2.wnyc.org/i/1200/627/c/80/1/Ironbound_Hiler.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@WNYC"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=470219771", "fb": {"app_id": 151261804904925}, "keywords": "npr, new york, WNYC, arts, culture, news, public, radio", "overhaul/config/environment": "%7B%22wnycURL%22%3A%20%22http%3A//www.wnyc.org%22%2C%20%22googleAPIv3Key%22%3A%20%22AIzaSyCDbxxvbl0Zj6af28IfWjJ-S0SKxwDXnkc%22%2C%20%22renderGoogleAds%22%3A%20true%2C%20%22modulePrefix%22%3A%20%22overhaul%22%2C%20%22ember-metrics%22%3A%20%7B%22includeAdapters%22%3A%20%5B%22google-analytics%22%2C%20%22data-warehouse%22%5D%7D%2C%20%22something%22%3A%20%22test%22%2C%20%22metricsAdapters%22%3A%20%5B%5D%2C%20%22contentSecurityPolicy%22%3A%20%7B%22script-src%22%3A%20%22%27self%27%20%27unsafe-inline%27%20%27unsafe-eval%27%20data%3A%20%2A%22%2C%20%22img-src%22%3A%20%22%27self%27%20data%3A%20%2A%22%2C%20%22frame-src%22%3A%20%22%27self%27%20%2A%22%2C%20%22style-src%22%3A%20%22%27self%27%20%27unsafe-inline%27%20%2A.wnyc.net%3A%2A%20%2A.wnyc.org%20cloud.typography.com%20fonts.googleapis.com%20www.google.com%20platform.twitter.com%22%2C%20%22connect-src%22%3A%20%22%27self%27%20%2A.wnyc.net%3A%2A%20ws%3A//%2A.wnyc.net%3A%2A%22%2C%20%22object-src%22%3A%20%22%27self%27%20%2A.wnyc.net%3A%2A%20%2A.wnyc.org%20%2A.moatads.com%20%2A.googlesyndication.com%22%2C%20%22font-src%22%3A%20%22%27self%27%20data%3A%20fonts.gstatic.com%22%7D%2C%20%22featureFlags%22%3A%20%7B%22embedded-components%22%3A%20false%2C%20%22django-page-routing%22%3A%20true%2C%20%22persistent-player%22%3A%20false%7D%2C%20%22ember-cli-mirage%22%3A%20%7B%22usingProxy%22%3A%20true%2C%20%22useDefaultPassthroughs%22%3A%20true%7D%2C%20%22EmberENV%22%3A%20%7B%22FEATURES%22%3A%20%7B%7D%7D%2C%20%22locationType%22%3A%20%22auto%22%2C%20%22APP%22%3A%20%7B%22version%22%3A%20%220.0.0%2B%22%2C%20%22name%22%3A%20%22overhaul%22%7D%2C%20%22sentry%22%3A%20%7B%22development%22%3A%20false%2C%20%22whitelistUrls%22%3A%20%5B%7B%7D%2C%20%7B%7D%2C%20%7B%7D%5D%2C%20%22includePaths%22%3A%20%5Bnull%2C%20%7B%7D%2C%20%7B%7D%2C%20%7B%7D%5D%2C%20%22dsn%22%3A%20%22https%3A//62cc19caee0944219c038a6287eff1c5%40sentry.wnyc.org/3%22%2C%20%22debug%22%3A%20false%2C%20%22ravenOptions%22%3A%20%7B%22ignoreUrls%22%3A%20%5B%7B%7D%2C%20%7B%7D%2C%20%7B%7D%5D%2C%20%22ignoreErrors%22%3A%20%5B%22adsafeprotected%22%5D%7D%7D%2C%20%22baseURL%22%3A%20%22/%22%2C%20%22googleAnalyticsKey%22%3A%20%22UA-283599-12%22%2C%20%22wnycEtagAPI%22%3A%20%22https%3A//www.wnyc.org/api/v1/browser_id/%22%2C%20%22environment%22%3A%20%22production%22%2C%20%22exportApplicationGlobal%22%3A%20false%2C%20%22wnycAccountRoot%22%3A%20%22https%3A//account.wnyc.org%22%2C%20%22wnycStaticURL%22%3A%20%22//media.wnyc.org/static/%22%2C%20%22wnycAPI%22%3A%20%22//api.wnyc.org%22%7D", "has_audio": "True", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "revision": "38c95afd1495bd1d3d3aac5bf07d20e1"}, "article_summary": "With another well-funded competitor, Newark Community Health Centers, planning to move in, it\u2019s an uphill battle for a new FQHC like Saint James Health to survive in a post-Obamacare world.\nNewark's Ironbound neighborhood is seeing new competition among health providers for now-insured patients.\nThey decided to call it Saint James Health.\n(Katie Hiler / WNYC)Ask anyone living in the Ironbound neighborhood of Newark, and they\u2019ll tell you this tight-knit community in the northeast corner of the city has a small-town feel.\nTheir mission is to serve Medicaid and uninsured patients that other doctors won't see."}
