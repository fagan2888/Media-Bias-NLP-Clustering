In 2012, Medicaid HMO enrollment in Michigan stood at 1.4 million compared with 300,000 in 1994.\n\nStarting April 1, Michigan plans to expand its Medicaid program by an estimated 475,000 low-income people under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Nearly 20 percent of the state\u2019s population will be covered by Medicaid over the next several years.\n\nThe top three Medicaid HMO plans in terms of enrollment are Meridian Health Plan of Michigan with about 295,000 members, United Healthcare Community Plan with about 243,000 members and Molina Healthcare of Michigan with about 214,000 members, according to the 2012 Michigan Health Market Review.\n\nMoreover, six of the nation\u2019s top 20 Medicaid HMO plans for quality are based in Michigan, according to NCQA. Those plans include Priority Health, Blue Cross Complete, HealthPlus of Michigan, Midwest Health Plan, United Healthcare and Upper Peninsula Health Plan.\n\nWanchik said Blue Cross Complete will most likely apply to expand in other Michigan counties in 2015, when the Michigan Department of Financial and Insurance Services next opens Medicaid applications.\n\n\u201cWe have been seeing about a 700-member growth per month this year,\u201d Wanchik said. \u201cWith Medicaid expansion in 2014 and over 475,000 people eligible, we will get our fair share in Wayne County.\u201d\n\nAnother factor in Blue Cross\u2019 Medicaid expansion efforts has been its investment in AmeriHealth Caritas, a national Medicaid HMO with more than 800,000 members in three states that Blue Cross paid about $215 million for a minority interest in 2011.\n\n\u201cWe have been working hard to leverage some of their health management programs,\u201d said Wanchick. \u201cThey have some really unique things, not just to help members address medical needs, but helps members communicate with nurses by (phone) call lines.\u201d\n\nOver the past several years, Blue Cross also has improved its quality scores with NCQA, one of the nation\u2019s leading quality accreditation organizations for health plans.\n\n\u201cWe are very proud of our NCQA ranking. We strive to be one of the top plans in Michigan,\u201d Wanchik said, nothing the Blue Cross Complete was No. 1 in Michigan in 2012 and is No. 2 this year behind Priority Health. In 2012, Priority Health was No. 2 in Michigan, she said.\n\nOver the past 18 months, Blue Cross Complete has added a number of programs to improve member outcomes and customer service. They include:\n\nA rapid response outreach team that identifies recommended health services for members that include preventive screens (mammograms, cholesterol) or services that a person with a chronic condition has missed (diabetic eye exam, specialist visit for a child with asthma).\n\nAn expanded behavioral health care program that allows members to seek mental health benefits without a referral. Each month, staff of Blue Cross Complete and the Detroit Wayne Community Mental Health meets to discuss ways to integrate behavioral and medical care.\n\nmeets to discuss ways to integrate behavioral and medical care. A pharmacy management program makes sure members are filling prescribed medications for chronic conditions like diabetes and asthma.\n\nA partnership with Matrix Human Services ensures members receive a complete assessment of economic, educational, social and psychological needs.\n\nJay Greene: (313) 446-0325, jgreene@crain.com.
