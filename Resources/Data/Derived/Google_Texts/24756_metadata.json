And I invite him to meet with families like the Whitehead family from Allen County, who write to me about the damage his Obamacare law has already done to them.\u201d\n\nWatch:\n\nThe president is unpopular in Kentucky and McConnell is a tight re-election bid against Democratic challenger Alison Lundergan Grimes.\n\nA new Public Policy Polling survey conducted this month said Grimes leads McConnell by two percentage points.\n\nMcConnell\u2019s campaign has worked to tie Grimes to the president and his policies\u2014namely the health care law and new pollution rules on coal-powered plants.\n\nSpeaking on the floor, McConnell pummeled at moderate Democrats for failing to stand up to the president\u2019s agenda.\n\n\u201cThese senators want everyone to believe they\u2019re opposed to the administration\u2019s waves of job-killing energy regulations,\u201d McConnell said.\n\n\u201cThese Democrat senators say they\u2019re ready to stand and fight. But when push comes to shove, they\u2019re nowhere to be found.\u201d\n\nThe PPP survey, however, finds economic issues favorable to Grimes such as raising the minimum wage, are just as important to voters as \u201crepealing Obamacare\u201d and stopping \u201cObama\u2019s war on coal.\u201d\n\nThe Democratic-leaning poll also examined public reaction to McConnell and Grimes\u2019 dueling plans to fund the Brent Spence Bridge in Northern Kentucky.\n\nKentuckians preferred Grimes\u2019s idea of closing tax loopholes over McConnell\u2019s call to repeal prevailing wage rules by more than a six-to-one margin, according to the poll results.\n\n\u201cKentuckians clearly prefer a Senate candidate who will close corporate tax loopholes and end tax breaks for the wealthy,\u201d Tom Jensen, director of Public Policy Polling, said in a news release. \u201cThese issues are as important to them, if not more important, than issues currently being debated in the campaign.\n\n\u201cThe poll suggests that tax fairness could be a sleeper issue in this race.\u201d\n\nThe McConnell campaign has blasted Grimes\u2019s approach to fund the bridge project as a tax increase\u2014one that mirrors liberal Democratic leaders.\n\nExperts have said neither plan has much political chance in Washington or could adequately fund the Brent Spence Bridge.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "89.3 WFPL", "description": "During a floor speech Thursday morning, Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell invited President Obama to visit Kentucky.
