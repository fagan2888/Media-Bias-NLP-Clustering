Most headlines centered on Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini\u2019s comments during an earnings call in which he questioned the sustainability of Affordable Care Act (ACA) exchanges, going more negative on the marketplaces than he had in prior exhortations for the industry to hold steady in the face of deep losses in the first two years of exchange trade in 2014 and 2015.\n\n\u201cOur individual commercial business ended the year with improved results over our most recent outlook. However, despite our improved finish, this business remained unprofitable in 2015, and we continue to have serious concerns about the sustainability of the public exchanges,\u201d he said. \u201cSpecifically, we remain concerned about the overall stability of the risk pool, including enforcement of standards related to special election period enrollment, where CMS has made some recent changes, but more needs to be done.\u201d Bertolini also cited the lack of predictability and full transparency of the risk-adjustment program, \u201cwhich is key to long-term program health, especially as the other two premium stabilization programs expire in 2017; and newly proposed CMS regulations on network adequacy and standardization of benefits that would limit our ability to offer affordable, innovative on-exchange products.\u201d\n\nStill, Aetna did realize better operating results from the ACA-related individual segment in the fourth quarter than previously projected, driven by improved medical costs and risk-adjustment estimates. \u201cBased on these updated estimates, Aetna\u2019s individual commercial business generated full-year 2015 pre-tax operating losses of approximately 3% to 4%, a disappointing result, but one we are increasingly confident we can improve upon in 2016,\u201d Bertolini said. The goal is to get to break-even for the $3.5 billion block of individual business as soon as possible, he stressed.\n\nOverall, Aetna said net income rose to $320.8 million, or 91 cents per share, in the fourth quarter of 2015, from $232 million, or 65 cents per share, in the same period of 2014. Operating earnings were $1.37 per share, beating the consensus estimate of $1.21 per share. For the same period of 2014, the insurer had operating earnings of $1.22 per share.\n\nVishnu Lekraj, senior equities analyst for Morningstar, Inc., tells HPW there were not many surprises in Aetna\u2019s results, but did note ACA-market developments. \u201cThey did a little better on the exchange market than what people were expecting. But nothing is going to develop until we see how the exchanges shake out as far total signups and how well the M&A [Humana Inc. takeover] is progressing for them,\u201d he says.\n\nSome more clarity did come on ACA enrollment from the Obama administration on Feb. 4, however, when it said about 12.7 million people had signed up for coverage this year. That number is in the range of the administration\u2019s stated goal of between 11 million and 14.1 million enrollees. Still, the 12.7 million is only 1 million more than signed up in 2015. And by the end of this year, the White House target is to have 10 million enrolled, accounting for dropouts throughout the year.\n\nWith all the discussion about health insurer losses on exchanges (see brief, p. 7), and threats by the likes of UnitedHealth Group to exit the marketplaces next year if things don\u2019t improve (HPW 11/23/15, p. 1), there are voices defending exchanges. For instance, Peter Lee, executive director of the Covered California exchange, put the onus on insurers to shape up their strategies. \u201cPlans on exchanges, whether in California or outside, should be pricing to make a reasonable margin,\u201d he tells HPW sister publication Inside Health Insurance Exchanges. \u201cOur plans have reasonable margins in California. And most plans have had reasonable margins nationally. If a plan doesn\u2019t have the acumen or strategy to make it work on an exchange, they shouldn\u2019t be playing.\u201d\n\nBeyond ACA exchanges, analysts looked to Aetna\u2019s underwriting acumen as a big reason for its positive fourth quarter. \u201cEarnings per share was driven by better-than-expected underwriting margin across both commercial and government programs,\u201d said Matthew Borsch, securities analyst for Goldman Sachs - Global Investment Research, in a Feb. 1 note. He said total MLR of 81.9% for the fourth quarter of 2015 was better than the 82.7% consensus. Medicare and Medicaid MLR did even better, coming in at 82.6% for the fourth quarter of 2015 versus the Wall Street estimate for 84.5%.\n\nCigna Sees Uneven MLRs, but Beats Street\n\nAlso reporting fourth-quarter 2015 earnings was Cigna Corp., which on Feb. 4 told investors it made more money than Wall Street forecast for the final stanza of last year. Still, the insurer said net income declined to $426 million, or $1.64 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2015, from $467 million, or $1.77 per share, in the same period one year earlier. But on an adjusted basis, net income was $1.87 per share, eclipsing the average analyst estimate of $1.80 per share.\n\nFor this year, results are expected to be hurt by an ongoing CMS suspension of Cigna\u2019s Medicare Advantage marketing and enrollment due to what the agency called \u201cwidespread and systemic failures\u201d in allowing members to access medical care (HPW 2/1/16, p. 7). Still, Cigna dodged a bullet with CMS\u2019s timing, since the Annual Election Period had already completed by Jan. 21 when CMS levied the sanctions. Cigna put its 2016 profit forecast at $8.85 to $9.25 per share, well off the Wall Street estimate for $9.30 per share.\n\nEquities analysts said on the surface, the performance by Cigna was \u201csolid,\u201d but a little digging put the results in a lesser light. \u201cBeneath the surface, the Medicare MLR was challenged a bit and while reserves on a year-to-date basis continue to be solid, there appeared to be a modest reduction in conservatism sequentially whereas peers have been building reserve positions in 4Q15,\u201d said Brian Wright, securities analyst for Sterne Agee CRT in a Feb. 4 research note.\n\nCigna said its consolidated MLR was 81.4% for the fourth quarter, topping the Wall Street consensus estimates of 81.6% by 20 basis points; it also represented a 20 basis points improvement from the same period of 2014. \u201cThe Commercial MLR at 80.4% was 90 basis points better than the 81.3% consensus estimate. The results were better despite continued high medical cost in the U.S. Individual business. The Government MLR of 83.1% was 140 basis points worse than consensus estimates of 81.7%, due to pressure in their Medicare Part D business,\u201d he said.\n\nWright added that the pending Anthem, Inc. acquisition of Cigna reduces the importance of slight \u201cnuances\u201d in Cigna\u2019s quarterly results. Separately, Wright said the expectation remains for the Anthem-Cigna deal to close in the second half of this year.\n\n\u00a9 2016 by Atlantic Information Services, Inc.
