Focusing on spending, price and labor, new briefs show how the healthcare industry is improving.

Earlier this month, the Altarum Institute released its monthly series of healthcare sector economic indicator briefs. They focus on spending, price and labor and are used to address significant shortcomings.

Here are the highlights of the three briefs.

Spending

The healthcare spending numbers were calculated through September 2014. Year-over-year , national health spending increased 4.7 percent and grew in every major category. The September gross domestic product grew over a 12-month period by 3.8 percent. In terms of dollars, health spending increased to a seasonally adjusted annual rate (SAAR) of $3.06 trillion.

Hospitals were responsible for $965 billion and represented 32 percent of total health spending. Physician and clinical services were second highest (20 percent) with $603 billion. Prescription drugs (10 percent, $309 billion) and home health and nursing care (8 percent $245 billion) were other major areas of spending. In total, 84 percent of total health spending is on personal health care goods and services.

Despite the increased numbers, they were not as high as expected.

“With the exception of drug spending, it appears that we are not experiencing the widely anticipated significant acceleration in spending associated with the improving economy and expanded insurance coverage under the Affordable Care Act,” the brief reads.

Price

The healthcare price numbers were calculated through September 2014. Year-over-year, healthcare prices were 1.7 percent higher, which is equal to the August year-over-year numbers.

When compared to the previous year, in September hospital prices grew 1.7 percent, clinical and physician services prices grew 0.8 percent, home health care prices increased 1.4 percent and prescription drug prices rose 3.8 percent.

“In addition to other pressures keeping the lid on health care price growth, (e.g., energy prices), the federal government is maintaining controlled reimbursement policies,” the brief reads. “This month, the final rule for 2015 hospital outpatient prospective payment and the home health rates for calendar year 2015 were released. The former came in at a 2.2 percent increase, while the latter showed an average -0.3 percent change to Medicare payments.”

Labor

The healthcare labor numbers were calculated through October 2014. They showed a solid growth of 24,500 jobs in October. Ambulatory care settings added an above-average 18,500 jobs, while hospitals gained an above-average 3,500 jobs and nursing and residential care gained 2,500 jobs. The health share of total employment held at 10.62 percent, down from the high of 10.66 percent last seen in December 2012.

“As we enter the final quarter of 2014, we see a continuation of the upturn in health sector job growth begun in April,” the brief read. “The health sector added an average of 15,000 new jobs per month in the first quarter of 2014, influenced by a very low 5,000 new jobs in January. By Q2 and Q3, the health sector was adding an average of 26,000 jobs per month, which is consistent with October’s 24,500 jobs.”
