Jeff Sessions (R-AL) is blasting the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal that was made public Thursday. Sessions tells Breitbart News Daily on SiriusXM that the deal is \u201can erosion of sovereignty.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not even asserting that it will create jobs in America, raise wages in America or reduce our trade deficit because these agreements in the past have been bad for all three,\u201d Sessions told Breitbart News\u2019 Stephen K. Bannon.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nBannon asked Sessions about a commission that is formed through the TPP that could potentially have an effect of global governance.\n\n\u201cI think for President Obama, I do believe the driving force behind this is a belief that this is some sort of a one unified governmental structure. It creates judicial bodies. The language of it confirms what I\u2019ve been saying,\u201d Sessions said, affirming the creation of an oversee commission that will have control over the parties and interpretation of this agreement.\n\nOn the commission\u2019s control and oversight, Sessions said, \u201cIt\u2019s really breathtaking and it\u2019s an erosion of sovereignty.\u201d He added, \u201cparticularly an erosion of congressional power.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe president can participate in some of these things and advance what he\u2019d like to see, but it takes the people out through their elected congressional representatives,\u201d he explained.\n\n\u201cIt is a contract,\u201d Sessions stated of the TPP. \u201cThese trade agreements have been one sided over and over and over again. I believe in trade. I voted for most of the trade agreements in the past, but I am particularly concerned about this one on substance and even more concerned about this commission because of this delegation of power.\u201d\n\nRussian media outlets recently reported that China and Russia had been invited to join the TPP, something the State Department said wasn\u2019t being negotiated at the moment.\n\n\u201cChina is ruthless in the way they do trade and it\u2019s given them an advantage over us,\u201d Sessions reacted to the Russian news reports.\n\n\u201cThe most dangerous part of it to me is the long-term establishment of an international committee that overrides American will,\u201d Sessions reiterated about the commission.\n\n\u201cThe Republican candidate for president cannot run in favor of Obamacare, cannot run in favor more taxes, more spending and more debt \u2013 goodness gracious,\u201d Sessions added, weighing in on the 2016 presidential race. \u201cI don\u2019t think a Republican candidate should be running for president that says they\u2019re for amnesty, or even more immigration and for trade agreement that don\u2019t serve the national interest.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sen.
