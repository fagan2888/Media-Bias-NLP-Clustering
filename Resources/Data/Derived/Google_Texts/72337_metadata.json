In Spring 2016, the new exam will feature relevant vocabulary, evidence based reading and writing, and the current mandatory essay will become optional. A perfect score returns to 1600 with additional points added for the optional essay.\n\nIt hasn\u2019t gone unnoticed that in recent years, the ACT has overtaken the SAT as the test of choice for high school students. So naturally critics wonder if the changes are designed more as a strategy to recoup market share than to truly enhance the test taking experience and results. You can read more about the changes on the AJC\u2019s Get Schooled blog with Maureen Downey.\n\nTest prep courses have long been one way that students prepare for and tried to improve their performance on college entrance exams.\n\nBut comprehensive paid test preparation courses can hundreds of dollars with options ranging from group and online courses to one course from Princeton Review that guarantees a score of at least 2100 or you get your money back.\n\nLast week, a parent contacted me and said her family was unable to afford the pricey preparation courses. She asked if I knew of any affordable options.\n\nThere are quite a few ways student can get some help with college entrance exams for free or for little money.\n\nMost of the well-known test prep providers offer free practice tests and/or seminars.
