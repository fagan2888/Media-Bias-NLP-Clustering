The most promising thing is we're moving in the right direction,\" he said.\n\nBob Corker, a Republican senator, said \"there's a deal to be had here\" but it was \"a shame\" that his party's focus in recent weeks had been put on Obamacare instead of cutting government spending.\n\nHowever, even if the two parties' Senate leadership is able to finalise a deal it would still face significant hurdles. Complex Senate procedures mean it could take days for a bill to be put to a vote and a single dissenting senator could further slow progress.\n\nTed Cruz, the conservative Texas senator who last month delivered a 21-hour speech against Obamacare, could try to derail a compromise if he felt it fell short of Republican demands.\n\nIf a bill cleared the Senate it would then go to the Republican-controlled House of Representatives, where John Boehner, the Speaker of the House would face a choice to either alienate the right-wing of his party by bringing forward the compromise or else demand further concessions and risk being blamed for the default.\n\nThe legislative timetable raises the possibility that even with an agreement a final law may not be passed by Thursday, leaving it unclear exactly what would happen when the US Treasury reached its borrowing limit.\n\n\"We've never actually tested it, we don't know what happens and we don't want ever want to find out,\" said Jason Furman, chairman of the White House's Council of Economic Advisers.\n\nThe Treasury would begin prioritising which payments it would make and which would it delay. It is likely to ensure that US bond holders, including the Chinese government, receive payment but welfare benefits for pensioners, veterans and the very poor would be delayed.\n\nIf a deal was not reached then within weeks the remaining funds would dry out and key agencies like the FBI and Federal Aviation Authority could be closed.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "GSACategory": "worldnews", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02698/obama_2698462k.jpg"}, "site": "@Telegraph", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@rafsanchez"}, "keywords": "Barack Obama,World News,News", "DCSext.cmsSect": "News;World_News;USA;Republicans;Barack_Obama;US_Politics;Raf_Sanchez", "DCSext.Channel": "news", "DCSext.MLC": "/news/worldnews/barackobama", "DCSext.Content_Type": "Story", "WT.cg_n": "news", "title": "US debt ceiling: Democrats and Republicans 'very optimistic' a deal is at hand", "section-id": 4411, "GSAGenre": "barackobama", "tmgads.pagetype": "Story", "DCSext.akamigeo": "US", "tmgads.section": "news-worldnews-barackobama", "GSAMLC": "news/worldnews/barackobama", "GSAArticleType": "Story", "article-id": 10378571, "WT.cg_s": "worldnews", "description": "The Democrat and Republican leaders in the Senate said today they were \"very \n  optimistic\" of closing in on a deal to avert a devastating US debt \n  default and end the two-week government shutdown.", "tmgads.channel": "news", "DCSext.pd": 1, "DCSext.Category": "worldnews", "DCSext.Level": 4, "DC.date.issued": "2013-10-14", "robots": "noarchive,noodp", "GSASectionUniqueName": "news-world_news-barack_obama", "last-modified": "2013-10-14", "fb": {"admins": "686953094,531239902,100002344351237", "app_id": 120118784736295}, "article": {"publisher": 143666524748, "contenttype": "story", "section": "World", "wordcount": 838, "embedcount": 1, "authorName": "Raf Sanchez", "tag": "Raf Sanchez", "subsection": "Barack Obama", "videocount": 0, "internallinkcount": 9, "imagecount": 1, "externallinkcount": 0}, "DCSext.articleId": 10378571, "tmgads.articleid": 10378571, "tmgads.level": 4, "tmgads.geo": "US", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"US debt ceiling: Democrats and Republicans \\u0027very optimistic\\u0027 a deal is at hand \",\"link\": \"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/barackobama/10378571/US-debt-ceiling-Democrats-and-Republicans-very-optimistic-a-deal-is-at-hand.html\",\"image_url\": \"http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02698/obama_2698462k.jpg\",\"type\": \"post\",\"post_id\": \"10378571\", \"pub_date\": \"2013-10-14T22:55:17Z\",\"section\": \"World\",\"authors\": [\"Raf Sanchez\"],\"tags\": [\"Story\",\"News\",\"World News\",\"USA\",\"Republicans\",\"Barack Obama\",\"US Politics\",\"Raf Sanchez\"]}", "GSAChannel": "news", "GSAChannelName": "News", "og": {"site_name": "Telegraph.co.uk", "description": "The Democrat and Republican leaders in the Senate said today they were \"very   optimistic\" of closing in on a deal to avert a devastating US debt   default and end the two-week government shutdown.", "title": "US debt ceiling: Democrats and Republicans 'very optimistic' a deal is at hand", "url": "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/barackobama/10378571/US-debt-ceiling-Democrats-and-Republicans-very-optimistic-a-deal-is-at-hand.html", "image": "http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02698/obama_2698462k.jpg", "type": "article"}, "DCSext.Genre": "barackobama", "DCSext.cf": 1, "tmgads.zone": "news.worldnews.barackobama", "DCSext.author": "Raf Sanchez", "DCSext.articleFirstPublished": "2013-10-14 19:21"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf696\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI think there has been some progress in the Senate,\" Mr Obama said shortly before the Senate leaders' announcement.\n\"I think House Republicans continue to think that somehow they can extract concessions by keeping the government shutdown, or by threatening default, and my hope is that a spirit of cooperation will move us forward over the next few hours.\"\nHowever, even if the two parties' Senate leadership is able to finalise a deal it would still face significant hurdles.\n\"I'm very optimistic we will reach an agreement that's reasonable in nature this week,\" said Mr Reid.\n\"I share his optimism that we're going to get a result that will be acceptable to both sides,\" added Mr McConnell."}
