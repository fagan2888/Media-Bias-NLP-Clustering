Fool me twice ... you know the rest.\n\nPerhaps surprisingly, that famous adage came in to play for the Colorado Twins Blue team during the 2014 Boulder National Invitation Tournament. The jester, if you will? 5280 Victorium pitcher Taylor Williams.\n\nCall it a gamble, but 5280 head coach Scott Bauer had seen Williams pitch well and deep into ballgames off three days rest before. So, when it came to starting the Douglas County High product for Sunday's title game against the Twins, a lineup he had handcuffed before in the tournament, Bauer let it play out.\n\nIn the end, 14 innings of Williams on the hill against the Twins worked out for the Parker-based club. Williams looked as strong on his last pitch as he did on his first Sunday at Scott Carpenter Park, striking out six in a 5-3 win to help his team claim the tournament championship.\n\n\"He's bounced back for us quick all summer, and he showed today that he could throw another seven innings on three days rest,\" said Bauer, whose team went 7-0 for the event. \"(The Twins) hit the heck out of the ball, so for him to shut them down twice in the same tournament ... I was leery about trying to beat a team twice using the same pitcher, but Taylor's been our man all summer. We were sticking with that plan.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWilliams didn't completely baffle the Twins on Sunday like he did in an 8-2 win Wednesday at Monarch High. In fact, the Twins out-hit their foes 7-6 for the contest.\n\nBut the loudest hits \u2014 doubles by Alex Kinnison and Danny Caruso \u2014 came with two outs and the bases empty in separate innings. After Will Amen came in to score the game's first run on an errant throw to second base in the top of the first frame, the Twins didn't touch home plate again until the sixth.\n\nBy then, they were digging out of a hole. 5280's Brett Minnick, another Douglas County High player, hit a two-run home run in the bottom of the first, Nick Mathey stroked a run-scoring double in the second to make it 3-1, and 5280 manufactured single runs in the fourth and fifth. The runs came off three different pitchers.\n\n\"We've seen good-hitting teams and we've adjusted, but this team, they were different,\" said Caruso, who pitched the first three innings and was saddled with the loss. \"They brought the bats, and we know next time we just have to fight a little harder.\"\n\n\"Everybody did a great job under the circumstances,\" added coach Haas Pratt. \"We have a lot of league games coming up, like 16 in the next two weeks, and we want to get in that state tournament. I would've loved to win this, but I think bigger picture, we want a good seed in that state tournament.\"\n\nMuch to Pratt's liking, the Twins remained aggressive as they attempted to rally. A delayed steal from Tanner Kirkpatrick of home plate produced the third run, and Scott Platt tried to stretch a single into a double in the seventh inning when a perfect throw from right field was necessary.\n\nBut a second tournament title just wasn't to be for the Twins, who earlier in the summer won the Cherry Creek Classic.\n\n\"If Scotty gets into second, maybe we start a rally,\" Pratt said. \"I've always preached to err on the side of aggression. I praised it, loved the way we played.\"\n\nSunday's title game was well-played by both teams after a couple of unkempt semifinals. Twins Blue benefitted from six defensive errors by Slammers North in a 16-10 win, while Longmont/Erie had fielding problems of its own (five errors) in losing to 5280, 12-4.\n\nLongmont/Erie's chances of making the championship came unraveled in the fifth inning against 5280, when the \"Trogers\" allowed five runs on just one hit. Still, it was a good run for the young team in advance of the American Amateur Baseball Congress tournament they'll start Wednesday.\n\n\"We just need to come out, compete, and keep playing how we've been this tournament,\" said Avery Peterson, who went 2 for 2. \"Bring it into next week, and we should be able to give teams a game.\"\n\nFollow Adam on Twitter: twitter.com/AdamDunivan24\n\n\n\n\n\n5280 Victorium 5, Colorado Twins Blue 3\n\nAt Scott Carpenter Park\n\nTwins Blue 100 002 0 \u2014 3 7 0\n\n5280 210 110 x \u2014 5 6 1\n\nW \u2014 Taylor Williams.
