In particular, people who post things about their romantic partner are more likely to have low self-esteem, while those who are constantly updating about diets, exercise, and accomplishments may be narcissistic.\n\nThe study, out of Brunel University London, was undertaken as part of an effort to understand what personality traits fuel people to post different types of status updates \u2014 such as boasting about achievements, proclaiming love to their partner, or expressing political and intellectual opinions. The research team examined 555 Facebook users through online surveys that measured the \u201cBig Five\u201d personality traits, including extroversion, neuroticism, openness, agreeableness, and conscientiousness. The survey also measured self-esteem and narcissism levels.\n\nThe researchers found that people with low self-esteem were more likely to post frequent status updates involving their significant other, while narcissists, who crave validation and approval, posted more about their achievements. People who ranked high in openness were more likely to post about intellectual subjects, and extroverts, not surprisingly, posted the most about their social events and day-to-day lives. But the narcissists appeared to crave \u201clikes,\u201d and actually tended to get more likes and social media approval for their bragging posts. Past research has linked those pesky Facebook braggers with narcissism, and other studies have attempted to identify introverts and even sociopaths based on their social media updates.\n\n\u201cIt might come off as little surprise that Facebook status updates reflect people\u2019s personality traits,\u201d Dr. Tara Marshall of Brunel University London, an author of the study and a psychology lecturer, said in a press release accompanying the study's publication. \u201cHowever, it is important to understand why people write about certain topics on Facebook because their updates may be differentially rewarded with \u2018likes\u2019 and comments. People who receive more likes and comments tend to experience the benefits of social inclusion, whereas those who receive none feel ostracized.\u201d\n\nOf course, diagnosing someone with narcissism can be quite complicated, and it\u2019s likely that you\u2019re not going to be able to tell who has what personality disorder simply based on their social media presence (although it can offer hints).\n\nThe researchers conclude with a piece of advice for all those on social media, whether you\u2019re one of the cool kids or a lurker who feels inadequate whenever signing in: being self-aware of how your Facebook interactions impact your friends can do you good. Many people choose to leave Facebook due to the myriad of negative feelings it can conjure, such as the low self-esteem that can result from comparing your own accomplishments with others whose seem far greater. It\u2019s good to remember that in reality, social media and Instagram filters make other people\u2019s worlds appear far glossier than they probably really are.\n\n\u201cAlthough our results suggest that narcissists\u2019 bragging pays off because they receive more likes and comments to their status updates, it could be that their Facebook friends politely offer support while secretly disliking such egotistical displays,\u201d Marshall explains in the press release. \u201cGreater awareness of how one\u2019s status updates might be perceived by friends could help people to avoid topics that annoy more than they entertain.\u201d\n\nSource: Marshall T, Lefringhausen K, Ferenczi N.
