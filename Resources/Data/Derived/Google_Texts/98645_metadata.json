What it has that Al Qaeda did not is a large number of members from the U.S. and other Western countries who have the ability to travel freely in the West.\n\nThe heads of both Congressional Intelligence Committees said they were concerned about the group\u2019s ability to target the U.S. and its allies in Europe.\n\nRelated: Murderous ISIS May Have a Secret Weapon -- Bribery\n\nISIS is recruiting in Europe and the United States, Senate Intelligence Committee Chair Diane Feinstein warned on CNN\u2019s State of the Union, and those recruits fighting with the group are prime candidates for further radicalization.\n\nThere are \u201cat least 100\u201d American passport-holders fighting with ISIS, she said, and an unknown number from European countries whose residents are free to travel to the United States without obtaining a visa.\n\n\u201cThere will be plots to kill Americans,\u201d Feinstein said.\n\nOn Face the Nation, House Intelligence Committee Chair Mike Rogers (R-MI), said ISIS is \u201cwell armed, well financed, and they have lots of free space in which to operate and train. We know that they have intentions to send people who have shown up with Western passports back to the United States and back to Europe. That is as dangerous as it gets. Now is it six months, three months, or a year? We\u2019re not sure. But I wouldn\u2019t wait. It\u2019s not whack-a-mole. It\u2019s in our national security interest.\u201d\n\nRelated: Terrorist Tycoons on a Horrific March to Baghdad\n\nThere were many calls for the president to do something about ISIS on Sunday. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) said, \u201cWe will either deal with ISIS now, or we will deal with them later. And later they will be stronger and more difficult to reach.\u201d\n\nWhat to do about ISIS, of course, is an extremely complicated question. The group is fighting against Bashar Al-Assad\u2019s regime in Syria, which makes it an indirect ally of the United States in that conflict. But its attacks on the regime in Iraq, which has been supported by the U.S., place it squarely in opposition to the U.S. in that country.\n\nFurther complicating matters is that the group is closely aligned with Islam\u2019s Sunni denomination, and opposes the Shiite denomination, which, while much smaller globally, holds power in Iraq and neighboring Iran.\n\nIran, which the U.S. has hit with crippling sanctions over its nuclear development program, has moved troops into Iraq to counter ISIS and support the Shia-friendly Iraqi central government.\n\nRelated: Iraq Could Become a Three-Headed Monster\n\nThe Obama administration has said publicly that it is not interested in providing any assistance to the government of Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki until it makes the government a more religiously inclusive one \u2013 meaning that Sunnis in Iraq must be given some of the power currently monopolized by the Shia.\n\nUnless that happens, any U.S. attacks on ISIS would likely be interpreted as a statement of solidarity with one side in a brewing religious war.\n\nCol. Steven Ganyard, a former fighter pilot who later served as Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Political Military Affairs said on ABC\u2019s This Week, \u201cAs soon as we drop that first bomb or shoot that first Hellfire [missile], we have picked sides. And we need to make sure that we\u2019re picking sides for an Iraqi government that\u2019s inclusive and that we aren\u2019t making a broader determination of Sunni versus Shia.\u201d\n\nFormer Vice President Dick Cheney appeared on ABC to continue his angry critique of the Obama administration\u2019s handling of the Middle East, warning of \u201cbig trouble\u201d in the years ahead because of the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nRelated: Could Hillary Clinton Have Prevented the Crisis in Iraq?\n\nAs usual, when asked whether the Bush administration, in which he was a key figure, deserved any criticism for the fallout from the war it started in Iraq, he avoided the question.\n\nWhile there was little evident agreement on the road forward, retired General James Cartwright, the former Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, made one point that should be clear to all concerned when it comes to ISIS.\n\nPointing out that the group controls a \u201ccommanding position\u201d of 300 to 400 kilometers along the Euphrates River, Cartwright said, \u201cIt is likely that this is a defining moment for them in that, if they can hold these positions and lock them down, it\u2019s unlikely that Iraq as we envisioned it will ever return.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The radical Islamic Army that has stormed through huge swathes of Iraq in the past two weeks looks much like Al Qaeda did in the years before the 9/11 attacks, but with one important exception: Untold hundreds of fighters with valid U.S. and European passports.", "title": "ISIS May Be More Dangerous Than Al Qaeda Ever Was", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/06/22/ISIS-May-Be-More-Dangerous-Al-Qaeda-Ever-Was", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/06182014_ISIL_ISIS_Standing_Guard_Iraq.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/06/22/ISIS-May-Be-More-Dangerous-Al-Qaeda-Ever-Was", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/06182014_ISIL_ISIS_Standing_Guard_Iraq.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@rrgarver"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "The radical Islamic Army that has stormed through huge swathes of Iraq in the past two weeks looks much like Al Qaeda did in the years before the 9/11 attacks, but with one important exception: Untold hundreds of fighters with valid U.S. and European passports.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd14a9\"", "article_summary": "Like Al Qaeda, ISIS has plenty of money and, with its takeover of much of Iraq, a safe place to operate.\nOthers are more concerned, believing that ISIS Is looking more and more like Al Qaeda did in the years leading up to the September 11 attacks, but with a crucial difference.\nThe group is fighting against Bashar Al-Assad\u2019s regime in Syria, which makes it an indirect ally of the United States in that conflict.\nWhat it has that Al Qaeda did not is a large number of members from the U.S. and other Western countries who have the ability to travel freely in the West.\nWe know that they have intentions to send people who have shown up with Western passports back to the United States and back to Europe."}
