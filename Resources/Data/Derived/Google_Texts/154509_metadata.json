This wasn't sinister. It wasn't a rogue agency. It was legal and proper,\u2019\u201d House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Mike Rogers said.\n\nAppearing with Rogers on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press, Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Sen Dianne Feinstein said that Obama made it clear in his speech Friday that \u201che wanted to maintain the capability\u201d of the NSA\u2019s surveillance programs.\n\nSen. Dianne Feinstein and Rep. Mike Rogers visit Meet the Press to discuss President Barack Obama's recently announced plan on privacy.\n\nShe said it will be difficult for Attorney General Eric Holder to accomplish the task Obama has assigned to him: to find a way that \u201cmetadata\u201d on telephone calls might be stored by private-sector companies or some third party, rather than by the NSA. But she said all but two or three members of the Senate Intelligence Committee would agree with Obama on wanting to continue the data collection.\n\nFeinstein said the critics of the NSA\u2019s surveillance programs underestimate how many people around the world see the United States as their enemy. \u201cA lot of the privacy people perhaps don't understand that we still occupy the role of the Great Satan. New bombs are being devised. New terrorists are emerging, new groups, actually, a new level of viciousness,\u201d the California Democrat said. \u201cWe need to be prepared. I think we need to do it in a way that respects people's privacy rights.\u201d\n\nFeinstein also contended that U.S. companies collect more data on Americans that the NSA does. \u201cWhen you look at what companies collect, the government does not seem to be a major offender at all,\u201d she said.\n\nRogers rejected that argument made by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden that in effect he and Feinstein had forced Snowden to tell the world about the NSA surveillance because as intelligence committee chairmen they had failed to monitor and control the agency.\n\n\u201cI couldn't disagree more,\u201d Rogers said. \u201cThat's like having the janitor at a bank who figured out how to steal some money deciding matters of high finance. This was a thief, who we believe had some help, who stole information the vast majority, had nothing to do with privacy. Our Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines have been incredibly harmed by the data that he has taken with him and we believe now is in the hands of nation states.\u201d\n\nThe Michigan Republican added, \u201cWe're going to have to rebuild whole aspects of operations from our Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines that will cost billions and billions of dollars because the information he stole and gave, which we believe is now in the hands of nation states, who are doing something with it. There's no honor in that.\u201d\n\nAlthough Obama is calling for changes among US spy agencies, he defended the NSA's mass collection of phone records.\n\n\u201cHe was stealing information that had to do with how we operate overseas to collect information to keep Americans safe\u2026. And some of the things he did were beyond his technical capabilities\u201d -- a fact which Rogers said \u201craises more questions. How he arranged travel before he left. How he was ready to go, he had a go bag, if you will.\u201d\n\nRogers added that he believes \u201cthere's a reason he ended up in the hands, the loving arms, of an FSB (Russian security service) agent in Moscow. I don't think that's a coincidence.\u201d\n\nAlso appearing Meet the Press was a dissenter, Alexis Ohanian, an Internet investor and co-founder of the web site Reddit, who contended that \u201cit is absolutely possible for the NSA to do their job without the bulk collection of America\u2019s phone records.\u201d\n\nHe said the consulting firm Forrester estimated recently that about $180 billion in revenue will be lost to U.S. firms \u201cbecause countries and citizens around the world no longer want to do business with American companies, because they no longer trust that their private data is safe\u2026. There\u2019s a real business cost on top of the civil liberties cost\u201d of the NSA data collection.\n\nThis story was originally published on", "article_metadata": {"description": "The  heads of the House and Senate intelligence committees applauded President Barack  Obama\u2019s defense of the National Security Agency in his speech Friday proposing  reforms to the spy agency.\n\u201cThe  most important victory was the pre", "author": "NBC Politics", "og": {"site_name": "NBC News", "description": "The  heads of the House and Senate intelligence committees applauded President Barack  Obama&rsquo;s defense of the National Security Agency in his speech Friday proposing  reforms to the spy agency.\n&ldquo;The  most important victory was the pre", "title": "Congressional intelligence chairmen applaud Obama for backing surveillance", "url": "http://nbcpolitics.nbcnews.com/_news/2014/01/19/22358363-congressional-intelligence-chairmen-applaud-obama-for-backing-surveillance", "image": "http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/__NEW/nn_01_ami_spying_140117.vmodv4.jpg", "type": "article"}, "contentId": 22358363, "section": "{\"domainName\":\"nbcpolitics\",\"displayName\":\"NBC Politics\",\"avatar\":\"http:\\/\\/nvcdn.nbcnews.com\\/_vine\\/images\\/av\\/30x30\\/group.gif\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/nbcpolitics.nbcnews.com\\/\",\"type\":\"group\",\"ass\":\"\",\"groupId\":\"7244\",\"articleCount\":\"4978\",\"seedCount\":\"3166\",\"memberCount\":\"33\",\"description\":\"\",\"createDate\":1321036920,\"groupType\":null,\"groupTypeId\":\"5\",\"blessed\":0,\"lastPub\":1464298734,\"isEnabled\":1}", "title": "Congressional intelligence chairmen applaud Obama for backing surveillance - NBC Politics", "trackData": "{\"section\":\"politics\",\"subSection\":\"nbcpolitics\",\"sitePageId\":\"a22358363\",\"headline\":\"Congressional intelligence chairmen applaud Obama for backing surveillance\",\"pageSource\":\"NBC Politics\",\"typeName\":\"Story\",\"byline\":\"NBC Politics\",\"tags\":[\"white-house\",\"barack-obama\",\"featured\",\"national-security\",\"meet-the-press\",\"updated\",\"appfeatured\"],\"seedSource\":\"\"}", "jenga-session-config": "{\"when_to_init\":\"asap\", \"load_pers\":\"1\"}", "cip": "208.185.118.4", "nv": {"contentId": 22358363, "contentType": "n"}, "date": "May 26, 2016, 5:20 pm", "server": "web09", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "canonical": "http://nbcpolitics.nbcnews.com/_news/2014/01/19/22358363-congressional-intelligence-chairmen-applaud-obama-for-backing-surveillance"}, "article_summary": "It was legal and proper,\u2019\u201d House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep.
