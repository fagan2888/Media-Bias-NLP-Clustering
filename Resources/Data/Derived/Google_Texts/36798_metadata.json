From left to right are Mitch Kido, David Leary, Dan Jolliff and Lynn Dungan. The city of Loveland is considering taking over operation of the course. ( Jenny Sparks / Loveland Reporter-Herald )\n\nThe city of Loveland will take over operations at the Olde Course at Loveland, including the pro shop, if City Council approves a recommendation by the Golf Advisory Board.\n\nAnd although rumors and questions were floating around about whether this move meant the end of the girls golf program, run by Kim Stiner, officials have said the program is there to stay.\n\nCity Councilor Troy Krenning who serves as the council liaison to the Golf Advisory Board said at the board's Aug. 26 meeting that \"change is probably imminent,\" but he doesn't see the proposition as win or lose, rather one that works for everyone involved. His concerns stemmed from what he called the dissension in the community about the issue of the girls golf program, which a lot of came from rumors, he said.\n\nHowever, Krenning said, the board members are the experts on the operations, and he would advocate whatever decisions they voted to approve when the issues came before City Council.\n\nThe Olde Course, located at 2115 W. 29th St., is facing some changes after board members have heard repeated complaints about its operations, especially in the pro shop, which is contracted out \u2014 the contract expires at the end of the year. The board's recommendation is for the city to instead take it over as it has for its other courses.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChanges that the board voted for unanimously in late August are staffing two people during peak hours at the course, including in the pro shop; upgrading pro shop selection and fixtures; holding adequate inventory levels into the fall; controlling the tee sheet; extending and improving supervision during evening hours and implementing all you can play twilight at the course; allowing for gift certificates to be used at any of the city's three pro shops; and providing consistent service at all three shops.\n\nThe board, in collaboration with staff, also wants to add an assistant pro at the course to oversee operations. Jim Dargis, the city's PGA pro at the Cattail Creek Golf Course, would serve as the head at the Olde Course as well.\n\nBoard member Jim Whitenight said at the meeting that he knows Gale and Kim Stiner (who run the pro shop) very well, \"but it boils down to what's going to be good for the long haul.\"\n\nOther board members pointed out that the negative comments they hear about the Olde Course they don't hear about Mariana Butte or Cattail Creek, and that the changes recommended are for the better.\n\nAnd they say it's a matter of business \u2014 from that standpoint, sometimes changes have to be made that people don't like but that are for the better.\n\nThe discussion about the Olde Course operations was split into three separate meetings for each of three topics: pro shop operations \u2014 discussed Aug. 26; concessions \u2014 likely to be discussed next month; and programs.\n\nStaff liaison Steve Southard said at the meeting that the city would retain rights for concessions and programs as well and contract those out. The Stiners, like other vendors, could apply for specific portions.\n\nThe day following the meeting, Krenning, sent an email to councilors following up on the issue of the girls' golf program, which he said had been \"favorably resolved.\"\n\nIn Krenning's email, a forwarded email from Kim Stiner stated, \"We just wanted to announce that we had a great meeting with Parks & Recreation Director Elizabeth Anderson, Golf Operations manager Steve Southard and Councilman Troy Krenning. It is final that our LPGA-USGA Girls Golf program is staying at The Olde Course and is considered a valuable part of this community. Additionally, I will be allowed to follow my passion and teach golf full time at the Olde Course. Gale and I want to THANK everyone who has showed us love and support and we are looking forward to a great future.\"\n\nSaja Hindi: 970-669-5050, ext. 521, hindis@reporter-herald.com, twitter.com/SajaHindiRH", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.reporterherald.com/news/loveland-local-news/ci_28769629/city-loveland-could-take-over-olde-course-operations", "modificationDate": "2015-09-06T21:32:05-0600", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2015/0906/20150906__07rhagolfw~1_300.jpg", "sailthru.author": "By Saja Hindi \n \n  Reporter-Herald Staff Writer", "description": "The city of Loveland will take over operations at the Olde Course at Loveland, including the pro shop, if City Council approves a recommendation by the Golf Advisory Board.", "ag": {"canon": "LovelandReporter-Herald:article:28769629:view"}, "startDate": "2015-09-06T20:17:48-0600", "og": {"url": "http://www.reporterherald.com/news/loveland-local-news/ci_28769629/city-loveland-could-take-over-olde-course-operations", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2015/0906/20150906__07rhagolfw~1.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The city of Loveland will take over operations at the Olde Course at Loveland, including the pro shop, if City Council approves a recommendation by the Golf Advisory Board.", "title": "City of Loveland could take over Olde Course operations"}, "twitter": {"domain": "reporterherald.com", "description": "The city of Loveland will take over operations at the Olde Course at Loveland, including the pro shop, if City Council approves a recommendation by the Golf Advisory Board.", "title": "City of Loveland could take over Olde Course operations", "url": "http://www.reporterherald.com/news/loveland-local-news/ci_28769629/city-loveland-could-take-over-olde-course-operations", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2015/0906/20150906__07rhagolfw~1.jpg", "site": "@reporterherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-09-06T20:17:48-0600", "sailthru.site": "reporterherald.com", "endDate": "2025-09-06T20:17:48-0600", "sailthru.title": "City of Loveland could take over Olde Course operations", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Loveland News", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "google-site-verification": "XzsHDcJw4iXBQEYtDXFRaUAdKzxhSvxWMgXyQQNFFzg", "byline": "By Saja HindiReporter-Herald", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2015/0906/20150906__07rhagolfw~1.jpg", "pubDate": "2015-09-06T20:18:45-0600", "news_keywords": "Loveland News, Loveland News news, Loveland Colorado Loveland News news, Loveland Colorado news, Loveland News Loveland news, Loveland News Colorado news, US Loveland News news, world Loveland News news."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdaae4\"", "article_summary": "( Jenny Sparks / Loveland Reporter-Herald )The city of Loveland will take over operations at the Olde Course at Loveland, including the pro shop, if City Council approves a recommendation by the Golf Advisory Board.\nThe discussion about the Olde Course operations was split into three separate meetings for each of three topics: pro shop operations \u2014 discussed Aug. 26; concessions \u2014 likely to be discussed next month; and programs.\nJim Dargis, the city's PGA pro at the Cattail Creek Golf Course, would serve as the head at the Olde Course as well.\nIt is final that our LPGA-USGA Girls Golf program is staying at The Olde Course and is considered a valuable part of this community.\nAdditionally, I will be allowed to follow my passion and teach golf full time at the Olde Course."}
