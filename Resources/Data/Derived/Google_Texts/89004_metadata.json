My husband and I get up each morning at 7 o\u2019clock and he showers while I make coffee. By the time he\u2019s dressed I\u2019m already sitting at my desk writing. He kisses me goodbye then leaves for the job where he makes good money, draws excellent benefits and gets many perks, such as travel, catered lunches and full reimbursement for the gym where I attend yoga midday. His career has allowed me to work only sporadically, as a consultant, in a field I enjoy.\n\nAll that disclosure is crass, I know. I\u2019m sorry. Because in this world where women will sit around discussing the various topiary shapes of their bikini waxes, the conversation about money (or privilege) is the one we never have. Why? I think it\u2019s the Marie Antoinette syndrome: Those with privilege and luck don\u2019t want the riffraff knowing the details. After all, if \u201cthose people\u201d understood the differences in our lives, they might revolt. Or, God forbid, not see us as somehow more special, talented and/or deserving than them.\n\nThere\u2019s a special version of this masquerade that we writers put on. Two examples:\n\nI attended a packed reading (I\u2019m talking 300+ people) about a year and a half ago. The author was very well-known, a magnificent nonfictionist who has, deservedly, won several big awards. He also happens to be the heir to a mammoth fortune. Mega-millions. In other words he\u2019s a man who has never had to work one job, much less two. He has several children; I know, because they were at the reading with him, all lined up. I heard someone say they were all traveling with him, plus two nannies, on his worldwide tour.\n\nNone of this takes away from his brilliance. Yet, when an audience member \u2014 young, wide-eyed, clearly not clued in \u2014 rose to ask him how he\u2019d managed to spend 10 years writing his current masterpiece \u2014 What had he done to sustain himself and his family during that time? \u2014 he told her in a serious tone that it had been tough but he\u2019d written a number of magazine articles to get by. I heard a titter pass through the half of the audience that knew the truth. But the author, impassive, moved on and left this woman thinking he\u2019d supported his Manhattan life for a decade with a handful of pieces in the Nation and Salon.\n\nExample two. A reading in a different city, featuring a 30-ish woman whose debut novel had just appeared on the front page of the New York Times Book Review. I didn\u2019t love the book (a coming-of-age story set among wealthy teenagers) but many people I respect thought it was great, so I defer. The author had herself attended one of the big, East Coast prep schools, while her parents were busy growing their careers on the New York literary scene. These were people \u2014 her parents \u2014 who traded Christmas cards with William Maxwell and had the Styrons over for dinner. She, the author, was their only beloved child.\n\nAfter prep school, she\u2019d earned two creative writing degrees (Iowa plus an Ivy). Her first book was being heralded by editors and reviewers all over the country, many of whom had watched her grow up. It was a phenomenon even before it hit bookshelves. She was an immediate star.\n\nWhen (again) an audience member, clearly an undergrad, rose to ask this glamorous writer to what she attributed her success, the woman paused, then said that she had worked very, very hard and she\u2019d had some good training, but she thought in looking back it was her decision never to have children that had allowed her to become a true artist. If you have kids, she explained to the group of desperate nubile writers, you have to choose between them and your writing. Keep it pure. Don\u2019t let yourself be distracted by a baby\u2019s cry.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The truth is, my husband's hefty salary makes my life as a writer easy.
