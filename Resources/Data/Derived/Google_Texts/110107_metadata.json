Washington State University\n\nYoga has been shown to improve health in a variety of ways \u2014 from boosting mental health to reducing chronic pain. Now, new research shows that yoga can benefit a seemingly unlikely group: fathers in jail.\n\nThe study, out of Washington State University, examined inmates at Chelan County Regional Jail in Wenatchee, Wash. The researchers watched 14 different groups of inmates partake in yoga classes over the course of three years. All of the participants were fathers of young children.\n\nIn the past, studies have linked mindfulness, yoga, and reduced risky behaviors among incarcerated populations, the authors explain in their abstract. \u201cThe present study extends current knowledge by combining a parenting program with yoga instruction in a 12-session series delivered to incarcerated fathers,\u201d they wrote.\n\nThe researchers set up a program called \u201cFit Fathers, Successful Families, Inside and Out\u201d and recruited fathers in the inmate population to join. The goal of the program was to improve parental resilience and competency, as well as reduce child abuse rates. They found that yoga paired with a parenting program helped the inmates accept a sense of vulnerability and responsiveness to children.\n\n\u201cYoga can be physically demanding, and the initial responses we got from the participants confirmed that,\u201d Jennifer Crawford, a lead author of the study, said in the press release. \u201cI believe the yoga practice helped participants become ready to learn and increased their willingness to try new ideas, absorb new information and begin to apply these in their lives.\u201d\n\nMany of the inmate fathers lived through childhoods with little parental support, so the researchers hope that an intervention would help stop the vicious cycle of \u201cmulti-generational cascade[s] of low resilience and less effective parenting,\u201d they wrote.\n\nTeaching resilience through the class proved to be effective, and they hope that they can expand the program to more prisons.\n\n\u201cA resilient person is one who can successfully navigate difficult life experiences, and emerge from these experiences a stronger and healthier individual,\u201d the authors wrote in the study. \u201cA resilient person does not simply bounce back, but bounces forward, transformed by the process of moving through personal challenges. This process involves decreasing stress, effectively solving problems, and building healthy relationships with others that result in positive changes and growth. Parental resilience specifically includes the ability to nurture children in the face of stressful situations, which in turn cultivates resilience in children as well.\u201d\n\nSource: Crawford J, Shrestha G, Hill L.
