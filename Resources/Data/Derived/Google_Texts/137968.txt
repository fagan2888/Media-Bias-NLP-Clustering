It’s that lame-duck time for a sitting U.S. administration again, and with it comes all kinds of associated political dynamics – those that affect both our own ability to govern and how seriously we are regarded by most major foreign governments. Here are just a few things that are already at work and will be for the rest of the Obama administration. The odd part of this matrix is that no one in a lame-duck administration will likely acknowledge the reality that they are on their way out, and hence will not to be taken very seriously by most anyone.

Most taxpayers do not generally understand the dynamics of a lame-duck administration detailed above – nor would they agree with the inefficiencies caused thereby. Most foreign governments do understand, however, and they simply go into temporary hibernation insofar as their willingness to do serious business with us during this awkward period of political transition.

Does it also mean that the president and his key staff are increasingly isolated from political and practical reality? While they might never admit it – as it’s very hard on the political ego to accept the reality of diminished influence, especially indifference – it’s simply a political fact of life in Washington.

Finally, don’t forget that it’s also the way we want it to be – we are famous for loving our presidents when they first come in and then being glad to see them go, especially toward the end of two terms. It’s not personal so much as it is simply overexposure and media fatigue. In fact, many – if not most of us – believe that it’s already time for a new show in town, and that 2016 can’t be here soon enough.
