Hobby Lobby \u2014 has little impact on most corporations with a large group of stockholders, it does assert that the contraceptive mandate violates a 1993 federal law asserting that governments cannot \u201csubstantially burden a person\u2019s exercise of religion.\u201d\n\nThe ruling last July appeared to open the door to closely-held companies objecting on religious grounds to provide any of the 20 contraceptives approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.\n\nJohnson Welded Products is a family-owned company which objects to providing contraceptives and abortion services as part of its insurance package because of the religious beliefs of its owner, Lilli Johnson.\n\nThe firm, which manufactures brake reservoirs for the trucking industry, filed a lawsuit against the contraceptive mandate in April of last year.\n\nRobert Muise, an attorney for the American Freedom Law Center, which represented Johnson Welded in the case, told the Springfield News-Sun in July that the Urbana company should be treated just like Hobby Lobby.\n\n\u201cJohnson Welded Products is in the same position as Hobby Lobby,\u201d said Muise.\n\n\u201cShe wants to run her company pursuant to her Catholic beliefs,\u201d Muise said of the company\u2019s owner. \u201cThis mandate prohibits her from doing so.\u201d\n\nLauren Hitt, press secretary for Ed FitzGerald, the Ohio Democratic candidate for governor, disagreed with the decision.\n\n\u201cNot only does this ruling inappropriately involve a woman\u2019s boss in extremely personal health care decisions, but it also hits at the pocketbooks of families who are already struggling to get by,\u201d said Hitt. \u201cAs governor, Ed will stand up against extreme restrictions on women\u2019s health care.\n\n\u201cOhioans deserve to know where the governor stands on this case, Hobby Lobby and others like it.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for Ohio Gov. John Kasich said, \u201cThe governor is and always been pro-life and we haven\u2019t seen the decision.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A federal judge has ruled that a small company in Urbana does not have to include contraceptive coverage as part of its health insurance coverage.", "og": {"url": "http://www.daytondailynews.com/news/news/national-govt-politics/urbana-company-does-not-have-to-provide-birth-cont/nhtBG/", "image": "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/img/photos/2014/08/21/de/42/DDN_Facebook_Icon.png", "type": "article", "description": "A federal judge has ruled that a small company in Urbana does not have to include contraceptive coverage as part of its health insurance coverage.", "title": "Judge rules for Urbana company | Urbana, Oh News"}, "twitter": {"site": "@daytondailynews", "description": "A federal judge in Washington, D.C., has ruled that a small company in Urbana does not have to include contraceptive coverage as part of the health insurance plans it offers its workers.", "card": "summary", "title": "Urbana company does not have to provide birth control in insurance"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "ddn", "vr": {"canonical": "http://www.daytondailynews.com/news/news/national-govt-politics/urbana-company-does-not-have-to-provide-birth-cont/nhtBG/"}, "cmg_revpath": "/re/292/2670685/news/news/national-govt-politics/urbana-company-does-not-have-to-provide-birth-cont/nhtBG/", "keywords": "Urbana,court,snsnewsletter,local,community,SNShomepage", "google-site-verification": "fR8PW_DfizdYW0uymF5VkAzfbNKqKxqfnhqsbXSP7oI", "news_keywords": "SNShomepage"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd125\"", "article_summary": "The firm, which manufactures brake reservoirs for the trucking industry, filed a lawsuit against the contraceptive mandate in April of last year.\nBy Jack TorryWashington BureauA federal judge in Washington, D.C., has ruled that a small company in Urbana does not have to include contraceptive coverage as part of the health insurance plans it offers its workers.\n\u201cJohnson Welded Products is in the same position as Hobby Lobby,\u201d said Muise.\nJohnson Welded Products is a family-owned company which objects to providing contraceptives and abortion services as part of its insurance package because of the religious beliefs of its owner, Lilli Johnson.\n\u201cShe wants to run her company pursuant to her Catholic beliefs,\u201d Muise said of the company\u2019s owner."}
