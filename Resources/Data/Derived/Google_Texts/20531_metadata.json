As recently as 2008, Florida voters passed an amendment to the state constitution to ban it.\n\nToday \u2014 a mere six years later \u2014 a majority of Floridians favor marriage equality, so you\u2019d think that any prudent anti-same-sex politician would just keep his or her mouth shut and avoid the issue altogether.\n\nBut then, you wouldn\u2019t be thinking about Florida\u2019s attorney general, Pam Bondi. In response to eight gay couples and the ACLU, all of whom have filed lawsuits in state federal courts to have the state recognize gay marriages performed elsewhere, she has called for the suits to be thrown out. She has even said that recognizing these marriages would \u201cimpose significant public harm,\u201d adding that it would wreak havoc on the state pension system.\n\nBondi\u2019s attitude is so contrarian \u2014 so tone-deaf to the direction that America has taken of late \u2014 that you have to wonder why she has voluntarily placed herself outside the pale.\n\nI certainly wondered. Since my profession as a political observer and commentator has made me a tad cynical, I first assumed that Ms. Bondi was setting herself up as a lightning rod to make her boss, Gov. Rick Scott, look more attractive to social conservative voters this November. These are folks who are normally unengaged in politics unless they can be whipped up into a righteous froth of hatred toward something or someone. Bondi is also running for re-election this November, but she doesn\u2019t appear to have any threatening primary challengers on her right flank.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "gay marriage, same-sex marriage, marriage equality, LGBT, Bondi, Pam Bondi, attorney general, Florida, Florida attorney general, federal court, gay rights, constitutional amendment, Rick Scott, governor, Republican, Sarah Palin, ACA, Obamacare, medical marijuana, 2014 elections, Chan Lowe", "og": {"site_name": "tribunedigital-sunsentinel", "description": "It used to be a politically safe bet to condemn same-sex marriage.
