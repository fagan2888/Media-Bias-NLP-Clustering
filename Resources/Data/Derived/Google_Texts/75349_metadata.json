She campaigned on the Navajo Nation and other reservations.\n\nArizona\u2019s First Congressional District is one of the most competitive races in the country. It\u2019s a huge district and geographically it makes up around two-thirds of the state. And it\u2019s relatively new. Arizona tribes wanted a stronger voice at the federal level. So back in 2011 they lobbied the redistricting commission to create the district which includes 12 tribal nations.\n\n\n\nAnn Kirkpatrick knows how to dress the part. To walk the Western Navajo parade she wore a turquoise suede jacket with fringe and a long black skirt. She\u2019s notorious for her cowgirl boots.\n\n\u201cAnn, where are your famous boots?\u201d shouted one parade goer.\n\nShe wore her moccasins today. But she stomped her foot and told the crowd, \u201cI can still put my foot down!\u201d\n\nShe shook dozens of hands, held babies and greeted the parade goers in Navajo.\n\n\u201cShe has been out here more than any person that I know of,\u201d Sally Chee said. \u201cShe\u2019s the only person I know who has helped the tribe.\u201d\n\nChee and many other Navajos said they\u2019ve seen the changes Kirkpatrick has made.\n\n(Laurel Morales)\n\nKirkpatrick is the democratic incumbent. In her two terms in office she\u2019s fought for impact aid for native schools and funding to repair a reservation highway. She voted for the Affordable Care Act, which provided continued funding for Indian Health and she helped expand health care for rural veterans.\n\nKirkpatrick\u2019s not Native American, but she was raised on the White Mountain Apache reservation where her father ran the general store.\n\n\u201cI grew up on tribal land and so I know firsthand the struggles they go through and I really want life to be better,\u201d Kirkpatrick said.\n\nKirkpatrick supporter Ron Lee worked the crowd in Navajo and English, yelling \u201cisn\u2019t it a good day to be a democrat?\u201d\n\n(Laurel Morales)\n\nDarlene Martin was at the parade but isn\u2019t impressed with the democrats or any candidate. Martin feels so disillusioned she\u2019s not sure she\u2019ll even vote.\n\n\u201cI have zero confidence in any of them anymore,\u201d Martin said. \u201cThey say one thing but they do another once you vote them in.\u201d\n\n(Laurel Morales)\n\nMartin questioned Kirkpatrick\u2019s voting record on environmental issues. Kirkpatrick has co-sponsored a bill that would allow one of the largest copper mines to be built on land considered sacred by the San Carlos Apache Tribe.\n\n\n\nThe Republican contender in this race would disagree.\n\n\u201cI hope voters give us a chance to lead in a very, very different direction,\u201d Andy Tobin said in a phone interview.\n\nTobin touted his budget-cutting record as Arizona\u2019s current house speaker.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve done many things at the state capital that have been helpful,\u201d Tobin said. \u201cAnd having inherited a very bad economy in a crisis unlike Arizona has ever seen before, I think we got it back on track.\u201d\n\nazleg.gov National conservative groups have put a lot of money into ads for Andy Tobin, in hopes of expanding GOP representation in the House.\n\nTobin\u2019s campaign is focused on democratic spending, border security and limiting the power of the Environmental Protection Agency.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very distraught,\" Tobin said. \"Our country\u2019s not safer, our military not stronger, our borders aren\u2019t more secure, our jobs haven\u2019t come back and our debt is larger.\"\n\nUnlike Kirkpatrick, Tobin was born in New York and lives just outside the district. But he said he knows rural Arizona and he recognizes that the Native American vote in this district is critical. The question is how is it critical?\n\n\u201cReally the game in this district is about turnout,\u201d said Stephen Nu\u00f1o, a political science professor at Northern Arizona University.\n\nNu\u00f1o said minorities make up almost half the district and they usually vote democrat. Republicans will benefit if minorities, including Native Americans, don\u2019t vote.\n\n\u201cThe higher the turnout the less likely they are to win this district,\u201d Nu\u00f1o said.\n\nUntil recently, that turnout was expected to be up, as the Navajos should have been voting on a new president on Nov. 4. But that presidential election might be postponed, which means voter turnout may well be down.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Arizona\u2019s First Congressional District is one of the most competitive races in the country.
