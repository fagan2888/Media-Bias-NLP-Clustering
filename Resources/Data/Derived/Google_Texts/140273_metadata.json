I also advanced numerous good governance reforms to bring sunshine to state and local government, minimize undue influence, prevent political corruption, encourage greater public participation, and ensure that taxpayer dollars are spent wisely.\n\nAs Chair of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, I worked to better protect and improve benefits for California\u2019s military, veterans, and their dependents, championing legislation to expand healthcare, jobs, and educational opportunities for veterans and members of the military, arguing that California can and must do better.\n\nWhen California faced the Recession and the possibility of economic collapse, I was proud to work in a bi-partisan manner with two administrations to begin to restore property tax equity to Orange County.\n\nTogether, we have pulled ourselves out of the worst depression in history. California\u2019s unemployment level is dropping; the state budget is projected to see a modest growth of approximately $5.6 billion in 2014-2015. Our rising home prices and numerous new building permits show our state is well into recovery.\n\nCalifornia also continues to lead the nation in implementing the federal Affordable Care Act. Today, 5 million uninsured Californians now have access to indispensable health services. Our economy is now recovering faster than most other states\u2019 and we\u2019ve even reclaimed our title as the world\u2019s eighth-largest economy.\n\nDue to term limits, my time in the California Legislature is now coming to an end. We have had many successes and there is no doubt in my mind that California\u2019s future is bright and that the best years are still ahead.\n\nThank you so much for giving me the honor and privilege to serve you. I look forward to continuing to work with you, though in a different capacity, once my current term in office concludes at the end of this month.\n\nAs always, I thank you for your support and am grateful that you have continued to entrust me with this privilege. For that I remain forever grateful.\n\nThe article above was released by outgoing California State Senator Lou Correa, a Democrat who represented California\u2019s 34th State Senate District.
