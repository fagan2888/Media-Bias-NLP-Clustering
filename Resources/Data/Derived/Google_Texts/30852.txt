President Barack Obama is disrespecting the deeply-held religious views of the Little Sisters of the Poor by forcing them to pay for abortion-causing drugs under the HHS mandate. But the Planned Parenthood abortion business thinks what is really disrespectful is pro-life Speaker Paul Ryan inviting them to attend Obama’s State of the Union address.

As LifeNews reported, Ryan hosted the very Catholic nuns Obama is attempting to force to pay for abortion drugs under the HHS mandate.

The Little Sisters of the Poor are asking the nation’s highest court to ensure they do not have to comply with Obamacare’s abortion mandate. The mandate compels religious groups to pay for birth control and drugs that may cause abortions. Without relief, the Little Sisters would face millions of dollars in IRS fines because they cannot comply with the government’s mandate that they give their employees free access to contraception, sterilization, and abortion-inducing drugs.

But reminding President Obama how he is disrespecting the religious liberties of the Catholic nuns is apparently itself disrespectful. Here’s how the abortion company sees it:

Never missing an opportunity, @SteveKingIA & @SpeakerRyan used tonight’s #SOTU address to send an anti-abortion message. The disrespect. — Planned Parenthood (@PPact) January 13, 2016

The tweet also condemned pro-life Congressman Steve King for leaving his guest seat open to the 57 million unborn babies killed in abortion.

After President Barack Obama made the symbolic political gesture of leaving an open seat at his State of the Union speech for victims of gun violence, a pro-life Congressman is responding with a gesture of his own. Congressman Steve King, an Iowa Republican, told LifeNews he would leave his gallery seat open for the 57 million babies who have been victimized by abortion in the United States since Roe v. Wade.
