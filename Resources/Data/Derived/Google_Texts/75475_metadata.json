A separate law mandates any protective order sealing records \u201cshall be public,\u201d but the judge didn\u2019t file one until after media outlets complained.\n\nThe public\u2019s right to access information under Oklahoma\u2019s laws continues to be chipped away, and the state lags behind others on measures that could hold judges and other public officials accountable for such behavior.\n\nOklahoma earned a score of 59, an F \u2014 one of 11 states to receive a failing grade in the State Integrity Investigation. In 2012, Oklahoma scored a D on the State Integrity Investigation, ranking 38th. The two scores are not directly comparable, however, due to changes made to improve and update the questions and methodology, such as eliminating the category for redistricting, a process that generally occurs only once every 10 years.\n\nIn addition to examining the accountability laws as written in each state, the survey also measures the difference between the laws on the books and how they're actually implemented. The probe determined that several states had a substantive \u201cenforcement gap,\u201d and Oklahoma\u2019s ranked among the most significant.\n\nUnchecked Cronyism\n\n\u201cPeople with influence \u2014 whether it\u2019s money or political influence \u2014 use that influence in a way where the average citizen does not get the same protections,\u201d said attorney Aaron Stiles.\n\nStiles is a former Oklahoma state representative and the author of a 2014 law requiring judges to narrowly tailor sealed records \"so that only the portions of the record subject to confidentiality are sealed and the remainder of the record is kept open.\"\n\nStiles maintains that the judge who sealed divorce records for Lambert and Shelton violated the law in a blatant example of \u201ccronyism.\u201d But the only way to challenge the decision in Oklahoma is for a citizen to appeal to a higher court at his or her own expense.\n\nOklahoma\u2019s lowest scores on the State Integrity Investigation were in the areas of judicial accountability and access to information.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not fair for the rich and influential people to have their records sealed while the plumber down the street doesn\u2019t have the right to have his records sealed,\u201d Stiles said.\n\nGardner, the judge, disputed Stiles\u2019 characterization, noting that anyone can seek to have court records sealed if they have been victims of certain crimes, for example. In this case, he didn't want paparazzi hanging out on the steps of the courthouse in Shawnee, he said.\n\n\"I did it to preserve the peace and dignity of the entire courthouse,\" Gardner said.\n\nOklahoma earned a category score of 48 on judicial accountability, in part because state law makes it optional for judges to explain their rulings.\n\nThe state has no legal process in place to evaluate the performance of Oklahoma judges. Although there is a body that has the power to discipline judges, its proceedings are entirely confidential.\n\nOften, judges simply retire or resign before being disciplined or removed from office. Gardner retired a few days after he sealed the famous country singers\u2019 divorce decree.\n\nAccess Denied\n\nFurthermore, the \u201cplumber down the street\u201d may have a more difficult time accessing routine public records he is entitled to under Oklahoma law, the State Integrity Investigation revealed.\n\nAlthough the state\u2019s 1985 Open Records Act guarantees that \u201cthe people are vested with the inherent right to know and be fully informed about their government,\u201d the reality in Oklahoma is that the government frequently doesn\u2019t turn over information without a fight.\n\nThe state earned a score of 33 regarding access to information.\n\nOklahoma does not make financial disclosures of lawmakers and state officers available online for public inspection, and the state Ethics Commission is currently considering requiring fewer officials to fill out disclosure forms annually.\n\nGov. Mary Fallin\u2019s office won a broad exemption under the Open Records law after a satirical news website sued to challenge her claims of \u201cexecutive privilege\u201d regarding access to records related to her decisions regarding the Affordable Care Act.\n\nAnother news outlet sued the governor\u2019s office in 2014 after it was denied records related to the state\u2019s actions in a botched execution.\n\nNews media and attorneys reported that they often wait longer than six months for routine records requests to be filled by the governor and Attorney General\u2019s office, despite the law\u2019s requirement for such requests to be filled in a \u201cprompt and reasonable\u201d manner.\n\n\u201cThe effect is that the press and public don\u2019t know how and why their leaders are making these decisions until well after the decision is already made, and the consequences are already realized,\u201d said Joe Wertz, a reporter for StateImpact Oklahoma and board member of Freedom of Information Oklahoma.\n\nOpen government advocates say average citizens in Oklahoma often wait longer for their records requests to be filled and are asked to pay steep fees for records. Denials can be challenged in court, but at a citizen\u2019s own expense (though judges can award legal expenses to the prevailing party in a records lawsuit).\n\nOklahoma also lacks a central agency to monitor records requests or enforce its access to information laws, part of several contributing factors to its significant \u201cenforcement gap.\u201d\n\nOften, even requesting a simple log of an agency\u2019s pending records requests, its fiscal spending or an executive\u2019s calendar can take longer than most consider \u201cprompt and reasonable.\u201d\n\nA Fiscal Bright Spot\n\nThe independence and openness of Oklahoma\u2019s State Auditor and Inspector\u2019s office earned the state its highest category score in the State Integrity Investigation, an 85.\n\nDuring the period of study, audits revealed fraud and waste across a broad spectrum of public bodies. The state auditor is an independently elected state official whose power is established by the constitution, limiting opportunities for political interference.\n\nCitizens have the power to request audits of any state, city or county office through petition drives, as the citizens of Henryetta did in 2014.\n\nAmong other findings from that audit, the State Auditor and Inspector\u2019s office reported Henryetta city officials had failed to comply with most of the Open Records Act requests by its citizens.\n\nThis story is from the Center for Public Integrity, a nonprofit, nonpartisan investigative news organization in Washington, D.C.
