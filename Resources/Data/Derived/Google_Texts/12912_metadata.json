They\u2019re also talking about making them.\n\nSurf parks \u2014 massive pools with repeating, artificial waves \u2014 are the latest buzzword in the surf community, as everyone from top athletes to retailers look for ways to expand the sport, boost sales and create a standardized way to train that could help surfing earn an Olympic pedigree.\n\n\u201cMother Nature stipulates that surfing only can occur where waves can be born. When man takes his hand to forming the waves, it unlocks the potential of surfing anywhere. And that is the most powerful thing,\u201d said Doug Palladini, president of the Surf Industry Manufacturers Association.\n\nThis month, dozens of industry leaders, surfers and investors met in Laguna Beach in Southern California for the first annual Surf Park Summit to spark interest in a business proposition that could breathe life into a sport that struggled during the recession.\n\nAbout 50 percent of independent, mom-and-pop surf retailers \u2014 the heart and soul of surf culture \u2014 shut down worldwide during the recession and those that survived face an increasingly saturated market that is limited by geography.\n\nEnter the dream surf park, a 2-acre wave pool capable of generating anything from tiny beginner ripples to 10-foot barrels every minute, with every wave the same. Customers would pay by the number of waves to learn the sport or refine their technique and learn new tricks.\n\nThe prospect has surf board manufacturers and apparel retailers salivating at the thought of new markets for surf gear and clothing in land-locked places like Kansas or Nebraska. But parks would also be prime real estate for sponsored surfing competitions that would draw both eyeballs and dollars.\n\nAt the summit, speakers tossed out tantalizing what-ifs: A national surfing league, much like the NBA, with feeder teams and city affiliations. Live, televised surfing competitions staged with predictable waves in a massive surf arena.\n\nSome even believe surf parks could propel the sport into the Olympics, a dream that has so far proven elusive.\n\n\u201cWithout man-made waves, there will not be Olympic surfing,\u201d said Fernando Aguerre, president of the International Surfing Association. \u201cIt\u2019s the ultimate wave-sharing that you can imagine.\u201d\n\nOlympics aside, everyday surfers who already live near the beach say even they would use the parks as a supplement to the ocean, to refine their skills on a consistent wave or get in a few rides when the natural surf is bad.\n\n\u201cIn a park, you can always get in a perfect position, the wave will always be perfect and you can really work on your surfing,\u201d said Cliff Char, 54, who\u2019s been surfing 15 years near his hometown of Seal Beach.\n\nDetractors, however, worry that in the rush to surf parks, the sport will lose its soul.\n\nBetting on artificial waves, they say, will sanitize and commercialize a pastime the most passionate surfers describe as a solitary, rugged pursuit where athletes and nature commune. They say the sport will lose sight of its culture and history if the next generation learns to rip on chlorinated water.\n\n\u201cThe problem is, \u2018surf culture\u2019 is about so much more than just riding a wave. It is about having a genuine respect and connection with the ocean,\u201d said Zac Heisey, a surfer and freelance writer who addressed the debate on his blog, In The Name of Surfing.\n\nOthers are concerned that the energy required to power waves big enough for surf parks will contribute to global warming.\n\nMomentum around surf parks has been growing since the 1960s and but fewer than a dozen serious parks currently exist in locations from Florida to Malaysia \u2014 and cost and wave technology have always been stumbling blocks.\n\nThat technology has now advanced enough to make parks economically viable, but operators will need to build near large population centers and make the pool the centerpiece of a larger development to make a profit, said Tom Lochtefeld, owner of Wave Loch, a wave technology company.\n\nSome of the biggest and best-known include Disney\u2019s Typhoon Lagoon in Florida, Wadi Adventure in Saudi Arabia and Wavegarden, a private research and development site tucked away in Spain\u2019s Basque country.\n\nA park that would attract serious surfers would run between $15 and $25 million to build and need to be at least 2 acres in size to allow surfers to paddle in, Lochtefeld said. With current technology, the energy price tag for one hour of waves could be up to roughly $500, he said.\n\nOther wave companies have said they can produce waves for $1 a wave, said Matt Reilly, director of operations and marketing at Surf Park Central, which put on the summit.\n\n\u201cIt comes in as how you operate a park and that\u2019s a question that hasn\u2019t been answered by anybody,\u201d he said.\n\nDespite the challenges, history is filled with examples of extreme, outdoor sports that have been tamed for the masses.\n\nBefore chair lifts, ski bums had to hike up mountains to ride down and rock gyms made rock-climbing possible miles from any mountain, said Dan Harmon, a development manager with Select Contracts, which builds and operates leisure and sport projects worldwide.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re places to train, they\u2019re safe, controlled environments that allow people that initial introduction and that is absolutely key,\u201d said Harmon, whose company operates Saudi Arabia\u2019s wave park. \u201cIf we can get them in, then we can get them hooked.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Surf industry hopes surf parks will expand sport", "title": "Surf industry hopes surf parks will expand sport", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/09/22/surf-industry-hopes-surf-parks-will-expand-sport/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-09-22T12:59:15+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-22T12:59:15+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd86c5\"", "article_summary": "Some even believe surf parks could propel the sport into the Olympics, a dream that has so far proven elusive.\nDetractors, however, worry that in the rush to surf parks, the sport will lose its soul.\nOthers are concerned that the energy required to power waves big enough for surf parks will contribute to global warming.\nEnter the dream surf park, a 2-acre wave pool capable of generating anything from tiny beginner ripples to 10-foot barrels every minute, with every wave the same.\n\u201cThey\u2019re places to train, they\u2019re safe, controlled environments that allow people that initial introduction and that is absolutely key,\u201d said Harmon, whose company operates Saudi Arabia\u2019s wave park."}
