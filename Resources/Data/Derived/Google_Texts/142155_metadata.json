Yet their residents are getting health coverage by the millions.\n\nAcross the country, efforts to resist or undermine the law persist. Calls for repeal haven\u2019t died down. Most of the states with Republicans in control aren\u2019t running their own insurance exchanges, but their residents are still getting covered and still getting subsidies \u2014 unless the Supreme Court in an upcoming case rules that the subsidies are illegal in states using HealthCare.gov.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nOnly 10 states with Republican governors have accepted billions of federal dollars to expand Medicaid to cover low-income people. Alabama, Missouri, Oklahoma, Texas and Wyoming, only one of which has a Democratic governor, aren\u2019t enforcing Obamacare\u2019s landmark reforms to the private insurance industry, so federal officials must do it. Local politicians in a host of states are calling for legislation to dilute the Affordable Care Act even more.\n\nBut from Maine to Mississippi, Texas to Wisconsin, enrollment numbers keep rising, no matter how they are sliced \u2014 total number of people enrolled, percentage of eligible people getting covered, the overall drop in the uninsured rate.\n\nThose gains pose a challenge in the coming months for Republicans, who face the prospect that millions of people in 37 states will lose insurance subsidies if the Supreme Court rules against the Obama administration in King v. Burwell this June. Consumer advocates and congressional Democrats have begun to seize on this, highlighting the stories of people they say would be harmed. And new polling from the Kaiser Family Foundation finds that a majority of the public, including significant numbers of Republicans, say Congress and the states should fix any gaps should the high court strike the subsidies.\n\nA Robert Wood Johnson Foundation study found that a ruling against the administration would disproportionately affect people who are white, Southern and employed \u2014 a demographic crucial to the Republican base. The foundation estimated that 6.3 million people could lose coverage if the subsidies end. Of those, 82 percent have modest incomes but are not poor, 62 percent live in the South and 61 percent are white.\n\nArkansas is the state that saw the largest drop in its uninsured population, after a bipartisan compromise on an alternative form of Medicaid expansion was developed under former Gov. Mike Beebe, a Democrat, and the Republican Legislature. The compromise approach, known as the \u201cprivate option,\u201d is at risk now, as Republican critics of the program have increased their ranks in the Legislature and are vowing to undo it.\n\nArkansas has company in its coverage gains. The latest Obama administration figures for the states using HealthCare.gov show sizable private insurance sign-ups in states like Florida, Maine, Michigan, Georgia and North Carolina, which have managed to cover at least 40 percent of their eligible residents.\n\n\u201cEven states where Obamacare is not popular with the governor and legislature can generate relatively robust enrollment, which is key to the ACA\u2019s fortunes because so many state governments are not friendly to the law,\u201d said Jonathan Oberlander, a University of North Carolina political scientist who tracks health policy.\n\nHis own state of North Carolina, which has become increasingly Republican in the past few years, is an example. Of the 1.1 million people who are eligible for coverage, 43 percent had signed up as of last Friday. That showing is stronger than expected, Oberlander said, \u201cgiven that the state government played essentially no role in publicizing the ACA or helping to enroll the uninsured.\u201d\n\nFlorida has the most sign-ups of any state, including big states running their own exchanges like New York or California. New data from the Department of Health and Human Services show that more than 1.3 million people in Florida have signed up or renewed their exchange coverage. That\u2019s more than half of the 2.5 million who are eligible, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Maine has signed up close to 63,000 of the 124,000 people who are potentially eligible.\n\nGeorgia has brought in 40 percent of its eligible residents. Wisconsin, led by possible 2016 GOP presidential contender Gov. Scott Walker, has gotten nearly 180,000 signed up out of an eligible 478,000 \u2014 well over a third in the state.\n\nHealth care experts say some of the states\u2019 numbers are expected \u2014 for example, Florida, Texas and North Carolina had some of the highest rates of uninsured people. Plus, even though federal money for outreach workers has been thin, outside groups made a concerted effort on enrollment and messaging in populous red states. Insurers also have worked to market their products there.\n\nNonprofit group Enroll America, a White House ally, concentrated its staff in 11 states with lots of uninsured people \u2014 all but one has a Republican governor. They are Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Michigan, North Carolina, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee and Texas.\n\nLarry Levitt with the Kaiser Family Foundation said substantial outreach resources have gone into Florida in particular, and outreach has also likely had an effect in places like Georgia, North Carolina and Michigan.\n\nBut the overall enrollment picture is still mixed. Some red states have covered less than 20 percent of those eligible for exchange coverage. And the states that have seen the sharpest overall drops in the uninsured are the ones that expanded their Medicaid programs, which most Republican states have not done.\n\n\u201cExchange enrollment is only one side of the coin,\u201d Oberlander said, referring to Medicaid.\n\nTexas is close to topping 1 million people \u2014 it had almost 941,000 enrollees as of Friday. Still, that\u2019s only 31 percent of the 3.1 million people who could get a plan.\n\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t a lot of effective outreach\u201d in that state, says University of Texas professor Samuel Richardson, a health policy expert who also volunteers as a counselor to help people with their applications. Richardson said media attention around the law this year has been much more muted than last year, and he has seen less traffic during the current sign-up period. That could change in the next couple of weeks, as the Feb. 15 enrollment deadline approaches, but it remains to be seen.\n\n\u201cGiven that Texas is a red state, it\u2019s doing fine. But I wouldn\u2019t put it as, this is a big surprise, Texas is going gangbusters. It\u2019s somewhere in the middle,\u201d Richardson said.\n\nAt the bottom of the list of HealthCare.gov states, Iowa has signed up only 37,338 people out of a potential 225,000, or 17 percent. South Dakota has signed up 18 percent of its potential market, and Alaska is hovering just under 20 percent.\n\nIn some of those states, Levitt said insurer marketing might be the missing piece of the puzzle. For example, Blue Cross Blue Shield is the insurer participating in the most Obamacare marketplaces. But not South Dakota\u2019s or Iowa\u2019s, so those states didn\u2019t get as much advertising. In Mississippi, Humana actually sent buses around the state to persuade people to enroll.\n\nThat marketing has been \u201ca secret weapon in getting people signed up,\u201d Levitt said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "The fight against the law persists, but people are signing up.", "title": "Red states see insurance rise despite Obamacare opposition", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/01/obamacare-red-states-health-insurance-114707.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2015/01/28/140128_health_care_gty_629.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Obamacare,North Carolina,Wyoming,Oklahoma,Maine,HealthCare.Gov,Supreme Court,Alabama,Florida,Affordable Care Act,Governors,Arkansas,Michigan,Mississippi,Health Care,Republicans,Insurance,Texas,Missouri,Georgia,Wisconsin", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "The fight against the law persists, but people are signing up.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde2f0\"", "article_summary": "POLITICO Pro Red states see insurance rise despite Obamacare oppositionRecalcitrant red states have done little \u2014 or nothing \u2014 to promote Obamacare.\nAnd the states that have seen the sharpest overall drops in the uninsured are the ones that expanded their Medicaid programs, which most Republican states have not done.\nStory Continued BelowOnly 10 states with Republican governors have accepted billions of federal dollars to expand Medicaid to cover low-income people.\nSome red states have covered less than 20 percent of those eligible for exchange coverage.\nLocal politicians in a host of states are calling for legislation to dilute the Affordable Care Act even more."}
