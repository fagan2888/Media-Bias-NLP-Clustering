But the president also showed a lighter side.\n\n\u201cFirst lady's moves on Uptown Funk?\u201d Besser asked the president.\n\n\u201cYou know, the first lady, I think we all understand, is a better dancer than me. I\u2019ve conceded that,\u201d Obama answered. \u201cI think I can sing a little bit better than her, but that doesn't burn as many calories.\u201d\n\nWhen Besser asked him about his favorite Republican, the president replied, \u201cOh, you know, I love them all!\u201d\n\nOne question did have a more serious side.\n\nBesser asked the president to rate the success of the Affordable Care Act on a scale from 1 to 10. Obama gave the law an \u201c8.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd the reason I don't put it at a 10 is because you can always improve something.\u201d\n\n\u201cSixteen million people or more have health insurance that didn't have it before,\u201d Obama said, adding that this is the lowest rate of uninsured Americans \u201csince we started keeping records.\u201d\n\nHe also said the cost of implementing the law has been less than anticipated but told Besser there\u2019s still more work to be done, especially getting states that haven\u2019t already done so to expand Medicaid.\n\n\u201cThere are millions of more people that could be helped, and it won't cost the state anything\u2026 We're just seeing some stubbornness that's really based on ideology not on wise public health policy that is preventing most people in most states from getting the Medicaid that would save the state money in the long term.\u201d\n\nYou can watch the interview in its entirety on today\u2019s \"Good Morning America\".\n\nLana Zak and Dan Childs of the ABC Medical Unit contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Obama Shows Lighter Side in ABC News Interview", "description": "Dr. Richard Besser asks President Obama a series of rapid fire questions about public health.", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 ABC News Internet Ventures", "author": "ABC News", "og": {"site_name": "ABC News", "description": "Dr. Richard Besser asks President Obama a series of rapid fire questions about public health.", "title": "Obama Shows Lighter Side in ABC News Interview", "url": "http://abcnews.go.com/Health/president-obama-shows-lighter-side-abc-news-interview/story?id=30147174", "image": "http://a.abcnews.go.com/images/Health/ABC_besser_obama_interview_jef_150407_16x9_992.jpg", "type": "article"}, "Date": "2015-04-08", "twitter": {"description": "Dr. Richard Besser asks President Obama a series of rapid fire questions about public health.", "title": "Obama Shows Lighter Side in ABC News Interview", "url": "http://abcnews.go.com/Health/president-obama-shows-lighter-side-abc-news-interview/story?id=30147174", "image": "http://a.abcnews.go.com/images/Health/ABC_besser_obama_interview_jef_150407_4x3t_240.jpg", "creator": "@lizzyfit", "site": "@ABC", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "abcnewsipad://link/story,30147174", "iphone": "abcnewsiphone://link/story,30147174", "googleplay": "android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/Health/president-obama-shows-lighter-side-abc-news-interview/story?id=30147174"}, "name": {"ipad": "ABC News", "iphone": "ABC News", "googleplay": "ABC News"}, "id": {"ipad": 306934135, "iphone": 300255638, "googleplay": "com.abc.abcnews"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "index, follow", "DC.date.issued": "2015-04-08", "al": {"ipad": {"url": "abcnewsipad://link/story,30147174", "app_store_id": 380520716, "app_name": "ABC News for iPad"}, "web": {"url": "http://abcnews.go.com/Health/president-obama-shows-lighter-side-abc-news-interview/story?id=30147174"}, "android": {"url": "android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/Health/president-obama-shows-lighter-side-abc-news-interview/story?id=30147174", "app_name": "ABC News Breaking Latest News", "package": "com.abc.abcnews"}, "iphone": {"url": "abcnewsiphone://link/story,30147174", "app_store_id": 300255638, "app_name": "ABC News - Breaking US & World News"}}, "Last-Modified": "2015-04-08 06:00:29", "fb": {"admins": 704409894, "app_id": 4942312939}, "keywords": "Barack Obama, President Barack Obama, President Obama, ABC News, Dr. Richard Besser, Republicans, Michelle Obama, health news, medical news, medical articles", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Barack Obama, President Barack Obama, President Obama, ABC News, Dr. Richard Besser, Republicans, Michelle Obama"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8ac3\"", "article_summary": "Besser asked the president to rate the success of the Affordable Care Act on a scale from 1 to 10.\nWhen Dr. Richard Besser, ABC News\u2019 chief health and medical editor, sat down with President Obama yesterday, the conversation focused on the health impact of climate change and gun control.\n\u201cFirst lady's moves on Uptown Funk?\u201d Besser asked the president.\nBut the president also showed a lighter side.\nLana Zak and Dan Childs of the ABC Medical Unit contributed to this report."}
