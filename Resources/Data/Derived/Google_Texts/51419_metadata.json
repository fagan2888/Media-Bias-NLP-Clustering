J-Codes relate specifically to injectable drugs that ordinarily cannot be self-administered, such as chemotherapy, immunosuppressive drugs and inhalation solutions.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Medicare reimbursement policy proposing that biosimilars have the same pricing code as their reference products could ultimately reduce R&D investment, according to an industry group.", "copyright": "William Reed Business Media", "author": "BioPharma-Reporter.com", "og": {"site_name": "BioPharma-Reporter.com", "description": "A Medicare reimbursement policy proposing that biosimilars have the same pricing code as their reference products could ultimately reduce R&D investment, according to an industry group.", "title": "Biosimilar makers slam proposed Medicare/Medicaid billing code changes", "url": "http://www.biopharma-reporter.com/Markets-Regulations/Biosimilar-makers-slam-proposed-Medicare-Medicaid-billing-code-changes", "image": "http://www.biopharma-reporter.com/var/plain_site/storage/images/publications/pharmaceutical-science/biopharma-reporter.com/markets-regulations/biosimilar-makers-slam-proposed-medicare-medicaid-billing-code-changes/10067393-1-eng-GB/Biosimilar-makers-slam-proposed-Medicare-Medicaid-billing-code-changes_medium_vga.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "biopharma-reporter.com", "description": "A Medicare reimbursement policy proposing that biosimilars have the same pricing code as their reference products could ultimately reduce R&D investment, according to an industry group.", "title": "Biosimilar makers slam proposed Medicare/Medicaid billing code changes", "app": {"url": {"iphone": "biopharma-reporter://Markets-Regulations/Biosimilar-makers-slam-proposed-Medicare-Medicaid-billing-code-changes"}, "name": {"iphone": "BioPharma-Reporter"}, "id": {"iphone": "id1023356457"}}, "site": "@BioPharmaReport", "image": {"src": "http://www.biopharma-reporter.com/var/plain_site/storage/images/publications/pharmaceutical-science/biopharma-reporter.com/markets-regulations/biosimilar-makers-slam-proposed-medicare-medicaid-billing-code-changes/10067393-1-eng-GB/Biosimilar-makers-slam-proposed-Medicare-Medicaid-billing-code-changes_medium_vga.jpg"}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "CEC8ACB0DB9777352167906B78F1EF96", "fb": {"admins": 100000722238608}, "MSSmartTagsPreventParsing": "TRUE", "keywords": "biopharmaceutical manufacturing, development, biopharmaceutical process, upstream production, downstream processing, upstream processing, biologics", "verify-v1": "WHomov305bLuKa7U4ALUYG/IcW/V1/nBXyagl4I9gR0=", "news_keywords": "Biosimilars, Medicare, Medicaid, CMS, Amgen, Pfizer, Hospira, Sandoz"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc0e0\"", "article_summary": "Created earlier this year, the Forum \u2013 which includes such companies as Amgen, Hospira, Pfizer and Sandoz as its members \u2013 has previously criticised the biosimilar payment policies suggested by the CMS.\nA Medicare reimbursement policy proposing that biosimilars have the same pricing code as their reference products could ultimately reduce R&D investment, according to an industry group.\n* US medicinal products covered by Medicare have a code relating to billing and reimbursement for Managed Care Organizations (MCO's), Third Party payors, Healthcare Professionals, Consultants and Hospitals.\nYesterday, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) announced proposed changes to payment policies in the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule for 2016, including an update to regulations focused on biosimilars as set out in the 2010 Affordable Care Act (ACA).\nThe update would ensure the payment amount for a billing code that describes a biosimilar \u201cis based on the average sales price (ASP) of all biosimilar biological products that reference a common biological product\u2019s license application,\u201d as of January 2016, the proposed policy states."}
