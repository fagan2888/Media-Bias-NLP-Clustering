(AP) \u2014 Relatives, friends and former classmates crowded a funeral service Saturday for a 58-year-old black man who authorities say was shot and killed by a white Montgomery police officer.\n\nThe mourners paid homage to Gregory Gunn, who police say was shot by Officer Aaron Smith on Feb. 25. Smith was arrested recently and charged with murder in the case.\n\n\u201cGreg\u2019s life is not in vain, for look at all of us who he has touched,\u201d the Rev. Herman Calhoun said at Saturday\u2019s service at the True Divine Baptist Church in this Alabama city. \u201cGreg\u2019s life was a life that has been used by God.\u201d\n\nThose who spoke described Gunn as a joyful man who loved cars and was a mentor to his nieces and nephews.\n\nGunn\u2019s niece says he would give her some spending money every time she brought home an \u2018A\u2019 average on her report card. She recalled she started doing so well that Gunn rescinded his normal offer, but would take her for rides in a prized sports car instead.\n\n\u201cIt felt good for him to be proud of me,\u201d she said. \u201cHe always made you feel joyful.\u201d\n\nLeon Wilson, provost at Alabama State University, sought to lift the group of about 200 mourners. Gunn had attended that college, where he studied accounting and pledged the Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity.\n\n\u201cIn moments like this it may seem we are pawns in the hands of fate, tossed about in uncertainty,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cBut I read a book called the Bible that says otherwise.\u201d\n\nHours earlier, nearly three dozen people marched through the Mobile Heights neighborhood near the Gunn family home, just steps from where he died. Yellow lawns signs reading \u201cJustice for Greg Gunn\u201d lined the street.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Police shooting: Funeral for Alabama man draws 200 mourners", "title": "Police shooting: Funeral for Alabama man draws 200 mourners", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Police shooting: Funeral for Alabama man draws 200 mourners", "title": "Police shooting: Funeral for Alabama man draws 200 mourners", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/03/05/police_shooting_funeral_for_alabama_man_draws_200_mourners/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/03/montgomery-police-shooting.jpeg11-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Police shooting: Funeral for Alabama man draws 200 mourners", "title": "Police shooting: Funeral for Alabama man draws 200 mourners", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/03/montgomery-police-shooting.jpeg11-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Melissa Brown", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "\u201cHe always made you feel joyful.\u201dLeon Wilson, provost at Alabama State University, sought to lift the group of about 200 mourners.\nThe mourners paid homage to Gregory Gunn, who police say was shot by Officer Aaron Smith on Feb. 25.\nHerman Calhoun said at Saturday\u2019s service at the True Divine Baptist Church in this Alabama city.\n\u201cGreg\u2019s life is not in vain, for look at all of us who he has touched,\u201d the Rev.\nTopics: From the Wires, NewsMONTGOMERY, Ala.
