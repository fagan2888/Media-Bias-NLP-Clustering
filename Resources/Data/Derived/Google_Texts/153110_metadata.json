Yet there\u2019s a risk of just that happening with some air bags, which is why the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said Monday that millions of vehicles equipped with potentially hazardous air bags are being recalled.\n\nRelated: How a Watchdog Blew the Lid Off the GM Recall Scandal\n\nThe recalls affect cars made by BMW, Chrysler, Ford, Honda, Mazda, Nissan, and Toyota. Owners of those cars can get more information about the recalled models from the NHTSA site.\n\nIn a statement, NHTSA said the recalls are \u201cinfluenced by a NHTSA investigation into six reports of air bag inflator ruptures, all of which occurred in Florida and Puerto Rico. Based on the limited data available at this time, NHTSA supports efforts by automakers to address the immediate risk in areas that have consistently hot, humid conditions over extended periods of time.\u201d\n\nRelated: At GM, Heads Roll as Company Works to Make Amends\n\nBMW, Chrysler, Ford, Honda, Mazda, Nissan, and Toyota provided reports to NHTSA about their individual investigations and will have regional recalls of certain cars sold in places with hot, humid weather \u2014 including Florida, Puerto Rico, Hawaii, and the Virgin Islands \u2014 because it can impact air bags with parts made by Japan\u2019s Takata Corporation.\n\nSeparately, Honda, Mazda, and Nissan recalled roughly 2 million older vehicles in the U.S. The recall comes less than two weeks after Toyota recalled 2.3 million cars for the same issue, which is linked to air bag inflators that can rupture and send metal pieces flying.\n\nLast year, Honda, Nissan, Mazda, Toyota, and BMW recalled roughly 3.6 million cars for the same issue, but Takata said earlier recall lists may not include all of the suspect air bags.\n\nRelated: GM\u2019s Recall Nightmare Continues\n\nTakata, a prominent worldwide supplier of air bags, seat belts, and steering wheels based in Tokyo, has had 10 million cars with its air bags recalled since 2009.\n\nAir bags accounted for nearly half of Takata\u2019s $5.47 billion in sales last year. It said that car makers are responsible for handling recalls by notifying owners and replacing the air bags.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Air bags are installed in cars to protect drivers \u2013 not severely harm them.
