Later in the day, she saw teenagers reading books to children in the gorgeous gardens, and an idea bloomed in her mind.\n\nThis idea \u2013 after a year of pondering, plotting, planning and planting \u2013 became a reality in 2010 when Bookworm Gardens opened in Sheboygan.\n\nThe gardens are divided into six areas \u2013 called \"Gateways\" \u2013 and are organized by theme from animals to memories. Each gateway features a stone pillar that houses laminated copies of the books that are represented in the area.\n\nThe gardens visually represent more than 65 kids' books \u2013 from \"Harold and The Purple Crayon\" to \"Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs\" \u2013 through plantings, whimsical art pieces and structures.\n\nThis year marks the fifth anniversary of Bookworm Gardens; hence, the massive \"cake\" in front of the gift shop. It's not edible.\n\nEntrance to Bookworm Gardens is free, although a $5 donation per person is recommended. The gardens are open from May 1 to Oct. 31 from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Monday through Saturday and Sundays from noon to 4 p.m. From June 15 through Aug. 31 the gardens are open until 8 p.m. on Tuesday and Thursday.\n\n\"Almost every day I hear from someone, 'I can't believe this is here!' and 'I can't believe how beautiful it is here,\" says executive director, Elizabeth Wieland.\n\nHere are 15 enchanting shots from Bookworm Gardens. When you go, make an afternoon of it and pack snacks or a lunch. The gardens are extremely picnic-friendly.\n\n1.\n\n2.\n\n3.\n\n4.\n\n5.\n\n6.\n\n7.\n\n8.\n\n9.\n\n10.\n\n11.\n\n12.\n\n13.\n\n14.\n\n15.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Bookworm gardens in Sheboygan is a magical place featuring creative, gorgeous gardens representing more than 65 children's books.
