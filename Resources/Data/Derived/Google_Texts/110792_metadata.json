The app also helps people search healthcare funding sources available to them, including tax credits introduced under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nAs of December, more than 700 businesses with over 20,000 employees had signed on to use the app. Revenues during the latest open enrollment period doubled from the previous period.\n\nThe firm sees a niche with the growing number of employers that are looking to outsource health benefits administration, and claims to have saved client companies an average of 36% on healthcare costs.\n\nHowever, the layoffs could highlight the tight market it's playing in. While Gravie isn't acting as a carrier, layoffs coupled with the lukewarm reception to \"hipster\" health insurer Oscar could showcase how uber competitive the payer field is.\n\nRecommended Reading\n\nMinneapolis/St.Paul Business Journal: VC-backed health care startup Gravie cuts 25 percent of workforce", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Meg Bryant", "twitter": {"domain": "Healthcare Dive", "site": "@healthcaredive", "card": "summary"}, "featured": "False", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/user_media/cache/43/8a/438a88e60c25f66af57624232deaba89.jpg", "sailthru.tags": "healthcare,type-newspost,healthcare-health-it,healthcare-payer", "news_keywords": "Health IT,Payer", "category": "News Post", "title": "After receiving $12.5M last year, this health benefits startup laid off 25% of its staff", "pub_date": "feb 24, 2016", "section": "news", "sailthru.date": "2016-02-24T22:39:03", "content_boost": 4, "touched": "True", "article_date_original": "Wednesday, February 24, 2016, 10:39 PM", "medium": "news", "description": "Healthcare", "sailthru.expire_date": "2026-02-11T22:39:03", "teaser": "<p>The company raised the cash&nbsp;in venture capital funding last year but is looking to stay lean during tough times.</p>", "sponsored": "False", "date": "2016-02-24", "sailthru.description": "The company raised the cash\u00a0in venture capital funding last year but is looking to stay lean during tough times.", "viewport": "width=986", "og": {"site_name": "Healthcare Dive", "description": "The company raised the cash\u00a0in venture capital funding last year but is looking to stay lean during tough times.", "title": "After receiving $12.5M last year, this health benefits startup laid off 25% of its staff", "url": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/news/after-receiving-125m-last-year-this-health-benefits-startup-laid-off-25/414402/", "image": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/user_media/diveimage/Fotolia_47360366_Subscription_Monthly_M_5ODXmzs.jpg", "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "aN-77CvDv8Rt4OQnHMaUSm6V87TF8ri5GDUv93p7pHk", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/user_media/cache/15/9b/159b920ef9a14886206108a6f1393e4d.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1365\"", "article_summary": "Recommended ReadingMinneapolis/St.Paul Business Journal: VC-backed health care startup Gravie cuts 25 percent of workforce\nDive Brief:Citing a tight investment market, Minneapolis-based healthcare startup Gravie slashed a quarter of its workforce.\nHowever, the layoffs could highlight the tight market it's playing in.\nAn April 2015 venture round netted Gravie $12.5 million from Split Rock Partners, Aberdare Ventures and FirstMark Capital.\nWhile Gravie isn't acting as a carrier, layoffs coupled with the lukewarm reception to \"hipster\" health insurer Oscar could showcase how uber competitive the payer field is."}
