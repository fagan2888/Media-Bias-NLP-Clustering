But on the other end of the spectrum, a free-market approach isn't the whole answer to housing affordability, either.\n\nSome people (on the left) oppose new market-rate housing development. They claim that new development only provides high-end housing, which doesn't do anything to help the supply of more affordable options.\n\nOthers with a more libertarian view (a more right-leaning view in our region) claim that if we get rid of all zoning regulations, the free market will take care of it and build housing for everyone.\n\nBoth arguments are wrong.\n\nYes, adding more housing must absolutely be a part of the strategy to make housing more affordable. And zoning changes to allow people to build taller and more usable space near transit, rent out carriage houses, and avoid expensive and often-unnecessary parking are all steps in the right direction. But some proponents go on to say relaxing zoning will solve the problem all on its own. It won't.\n\nThe free market will only build housing for higher incomes\n\nEven if cities roll back many land use regulations, squeeze down construction costs, and leverage new financing tools, the cost of building new housing won't fall below a certain point.\n\n\n\nGraph from McKinsey.
