Obamacare has proven to be no exception to this rule.\"\n\nHe called for repealing the contentious law, known as \"Obamacare,\" and replacing it \"with a system that empowers the American people with control over their own health care.\"\n\nCarson laid out his health care proposal, which would establish Health Empowerment Accounts - an expanded version of Health Savings Accounts - to Americans with valid Social Security numbers.\n\nThe accounts, he explained, will not be owned by the government or large corporations, but rather individuals and they will remain with the owner despite job changes or relocation in other states. They would be created for every child at birth and be \"freely transferable\" among family members, Carson added.\n\n\"This system will enable Americans to build their own health accounts and grow them through a lifetime,\" he wrote. \"Combined with high-deductible major medical coverage, HEAs will ensure that all American citizens have the ability to make health care choices that meet their individual needs, while also protecting them from the potential costs of major health problems and hospitalizations.\"\n\nCarson further contended that instituting HEAs in Medicare and Medicaid would reduce the financial burdens that threaten their long-term solvency.\n\nAmong other things, he added, his health care proposal would increase the age of Medicare eligibility to keep pace with the growing average American lifespan. The age would be increased by two months each year until reaching age 70, when it would be indexed to keep pace with life expectancy.\n\nCarson's plan would also allow Medicaid enrollees to obtain the same private health insurance as other Americans. Medicaid would provide fixed-dollar support to states, which the GOP candidate said must use the funds for insurance premium payments and to seed HEAs for enrollees.\n\n\"By expanding HEAs and high-deductible major medical coverage, my plan returns money and decision-making where it belongs \u2014 to the hands of American patients and their doctors,\" he concluded. \"Consumers will have more choices, lower costs, and a higher quality of care.\n\n\"At the same time, Medicare and Medicaid enrollees will have equal access to the same doctors and hospitals as the rest of the population. My plan puts faith in the American people, not a massive, faceless bureaucracy.\"", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Ben Carson, health care system, ben-carson, boston-globe, editorial, health-care, medicaid, medicare, presidential-campaign-2016, news", "title": "GOP Presidential hopeful Ben Carson criticizes 'Obamacare,' offers own health care plan to replace it in Boston Globe editorial", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"GOP Presidential hopeful Ben Carson criticizes \\u0027Obamacare,\\u0027 offers own health care plan to replace it in Boston Globe editorial\", \"link\": \"http://www.masslive.com/politics/index.ssf/2015/12/gop_presidential_hopeful_ben_c.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://image.masslive.com/home/mass-media/width620/img/republican/photo/2015/12/15/-f0ae246baf47fd74.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"17652357\", \"pub_date\": \"2015-12-16T20:50:28Z\", \"author\": \"Shannon Young | syoung@repub.com\", \"tags\": [\"@homepage\",\"@mobile\",\"ben-carson\",\"boston-globe\",\"editorial\",\"health-care\",\"medicaid\",\"medicare\",\"presidential-campaign-2016\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://image.masslive.com/home/mass-media/width620/img/republican/photo/2015/12/15/-f0ae246baf47fd74.jpg", "creator": "@shannonyoung413", "site": "@masslivenews", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson called to repeal the Affordable Care Act and offered his own health care overhaul proposal in a Boston Globe editorial published this week."}, "article_date_updated": "Wednesday, December 16, 2015,  3:55 PM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"short_title\": \"Ben Carson offers health care plan in Boston Globe editorial\", \"image_url\": \"http://media.masslive.com/republican/photo/2015/12/15/-f0ae246baf47fd74.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"shannonyoung\", \"author_nickname\": \"Shannon Young | syoung@repub.com\", \"author_id\": \"12580919\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Politics - MassLive.com\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.masslive.com/politics/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "masslive.com", "description": "Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson called to repeal the Affordable Care Act and offered his own health care overhaul proposal in a Boston Globe editorial published this week.", "title": "GOP Presidential hopeful Ben Carson criticizes 'Obamacare,' offers own health care plan to replace it in Boston Globe editorial", "url": "http://www.masslive.com/politics/index.ssf/2015/12/gop_presidential_hopeful_ben_c.html", "image": "http://image.masslive.com/home/mass-media/width620/img/republican/photo/2015/12/15/-f0ae246baf47fd74.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "masslive.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Wednesday, December 16, 2015,  3:50 PM", "article_author": "Shannon Young | syoung@repub.com", "Description": "Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson called to repeal the Affordable Care Act and offered his own health care overhaul proposal in a Boston Globe editorial published this week."}, "article_summary": "Carson laid out his health care proposal, which would establish Health Empowerment Accounts - an expanded version of Health Savings Accounts - to Americans with valid Social Security numbers.\nSPRINGFIELD \u2012 Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson called to repeal the Affordable Care Act and offered his own health care overhaul proposal to take its place in a Boston Globe editorial published this week.\n\"This system will enable Americans to build their own health accounts and grow them through a lifetime,\" he wrote.\nAmong other things, he added, his health care proposal would increase the age of Medicare eligibility to keep pace with the growing average American lifespan.\nHe called for repealing the contentious law, known as \"Obamacare,\" and replacing it \"with a system that empowers the American people with control over their own health care.\""}
