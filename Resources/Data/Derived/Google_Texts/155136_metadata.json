To her credit, the \u201cDancing With the Stars\u201d winner and \u201cRock of Ages\u201d actress quickly apologized on Twitter for her choice of costume.\n\nAlso read: Tom Hanks \u2018Blackface\u2019 Video Fallout Continues: Investment Banker Apologizes\n\n\u201cI am a huge fan of the show Orange is the New black, actress Uzo Aduba, and the character she has created,\u201d Hough tweeted. \u201cIt certainly was never my intention to be disrespectful or demeaning to anyone in any way. I realize my costume hurt and offended people and I truly apologize.\u201d\n\nOf course, the fallout from these kind of racially charged makeup can be intense. In 1993, Ted Danson stirred up blistering media criticism after appearing in blackface at a Friar\u2019s Club comedy roast in honor of then-girlfriend Whoopi Goldberg. He also offered up a boatload of racially offensive humor, which didn\u2019t help matters.\n\nWe\u2019ve reached out to Hough\u2019s representatives for additional comment, but they have yet to respond.\n\nBet that twerking Miley Cyrus costume is looking mighty appealing right about now.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/julianne-hough-150x150.jpg", "sailthru.author": "Brent Lang", "description": "\"Dancing With the Stars\" winner thought it would be funny to go as Crazy Eyes from \"Orange is the New Black.\" The internet disagreed.", "generator": "WooFramework 6.2.0", "og": {"site_name": "TheWrap", "description": "\"Dancing With the Stars\" winner thought it would be funny to go as Crazy Eyes from \"Orange is the New Black.\" The internet disagreed.", "title": "Julianne Hough Apologizes for Wearing Blackface As Part of Halloween Costume", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 614, "identifier": "http://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/julianne-hough.jpg", "height": 412}, "updated_time": "2014-07-10T20:31:27+00:00", "url": "http://www.thewrap.com/julianne-hough-apologizes-wearing-blackface-part-halloween-costume/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "&#8220;Dancing With the Stars&#8221; winner thought it would be funny to go as Crazy Eyes from &#8220;Orange is the New Black.&#8221; The internet disagreed.", "creator": "@brentalang", "url": "http://www.thewrap.com/julianne-hough-apologizes-wearing-blackface-part-halloween-costume/", "image": {"src": "http://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/julianne-hough-340x300.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/julianne-hough-340x300.jpg"}, "title": "Julianne Hough Apologizes for Wearing Blackface As Part of Halloween Costume", "site": "@thewrap", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2013-10-26T19:56:00+00:00", "sailthru.title": "Julianne Hough Apologizes for Wearing Blackface As Part of Halloween Costume", "wp-parsely_version": "1.6", "fb": {"app_id": 228236404181023}, "google-site-verification": "-PpFSIrGHybVDxbndrL6MCngw3j6BXdy0xDVBVVOacI", "sailthru.tags": "miley cyrus,whoopi goldberg,julianne hough,ted danson", "article": {"publisher": "http://facebook.com/thewrap", "section": "Media", "tag": "Whoopi Goldberg", "published_time": "2013-10-26T12:56:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-10T20:31:27+00:00"}, "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"Julianne Hough Apologizes for Wearing Blackface As Part of Halloween Costume\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/www.thewrap.com\\/julianne-hough-apologizes-wearing-blackface-part-halloween-costume\\/\",\"image_url\":\"http:\\/\\/www.thewrap.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2013\\/10\\/julianne-hough-150x150.jpg\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":\"173165\",\"pub_date\":\"2013-10-26T19:56:00Z\",\"section\":\"Media\",\"author\":\"Brent Lang\",\"tags\":[\"julianne hough\",\"miley cyrus\",\"ted danson\",\"whoopi goldberg\"]}", "sailthru.category": "media,tv", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/julianne-hough.jpg", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=6.0, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "To her credit, the \u201cDancing With the Stars\u201d winner and \u201cRock of Ages\u201d actress quickly apologized on Twitter for her choice of costume.\nLooks like Julianne Hough learned the hard way that some people take offense in the 21st century when white starlets wear black face.\n\u201cDancing With the Stars\u201d winner thought it would be funny to go as Crazy Eyes from \u201cOrange is the New Black.\u201d The internet disagreed.\nAlso read: Tom Hanks \u2018Blackface\u2019 Video Fallout Continues: Investment Banker Apologizes\u201cI am a huge fan of the show Orange is the New black, actress Uzo Aduba, and the character she has created,\u201d Hough tweeted.\nI realize my costume hurt and offended people and I truly apologize.\u201dOf course, the fallout from these kind of racially charged makeup can be intense."}
