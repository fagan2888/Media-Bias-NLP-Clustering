People who don\u2019t buy health insurance in 2015 (open enrollment in marketplace plans starts Nov. 15) could face an even steeper penalty.\n\nHowever, there are so many exemptions (more than two dozen) that most who lack coverage can avoid the penalty, assuming they can work through the paperwork maze.\n\nPeople must apply and get approved for some exemptions, others they can claim, without approval, based on their income or other factors.\n\nEven if they can\u2019t get an exemption, \u201cfailure to pay it is not a crime, and the IRS cannot use liens or levies to collect the penalty,\u201d Wolters Kluwer CCH said in a report. The government could withhold the penalty from your tax refund, if you are due one, and it could add interest to unpaid penalties, said Mark Luscombe, principal federal tax analyst with CCH.\n\nThe penalty is the stick part of the Affordable Care Act. Also called the individual mandate, it fines people who don\u2019t get qualified health insurance through an employer, a state-run marketplace, Medicare, Medicaid or on their own \u2014 unless they qualify for an exception.\n\nDelayed mandate\n\nEmployers with 50 or more workers are required to offer employees coverage or pay a fine. However, this employer mandate was delayed until 2015 or 2016 (depending on employer size).\n\nThe act also provides a carrot: Households with income up to 400 percent of the federal poverty level can get a premium subsidy to buy insurance through a state-run exchange, such as Covered California.\n\nPresident Obama said last week that he won\u2019t back down on the individual mandate, but it\u2019s not clear how effective the mandate will be, considering its gaping loopholes. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that 30 million people won\u2019t have health coverage in 2016, but only 4 million of them will pay a penalty.\n\nHowever, without the threat of a penalty, many people would not get coverage. A Kaiser Family Foundation survey of Californians who were uninsured last fall and gained coverage in 2014 found that the most common reason (21 percent) they got health coverage was because it is the law and they didn\u2019t want to be fined.\n\nA line has been added to 2014 tax returns in which people will indicate whether they had health insurance coverage or owe a fine. If they want to claim an exemption, they must complete Form 8965, which is new and sure to cause headaches. The instructions are 12 pages long.\n\nTaxpayers can claim some exemptions right on this form. For others, they must get approval from the federal marketplace (only Connecticut residents must apply to their state exchange).\n\n\u201cYou send in your application and documentation.\u201d If it is approved, \u201cthey send you an exemption certificate number. That number you have to put on your return,\u201d said Lindsey Buchholz, principal tax research analyst at the Tax Institute at H&R Block.\n\nFiguring the penalty will be equally painful.\n\nFiguring the penalty\n\nThe penalty is imposed for each month individuals do not have minimum essential health coverage for themselves and their dependents, CCH said.\n\nThe penalty is either a flat amount or a percentage of income, whichever is higher, but it won\u2019t exceed the average national cost of a bronze-level health plan from a marketplace. The penalties start out low but go up in future years.\n\nFor 2014, the flat amount is $95 for each adult in the household without insurance, up to a maximum of $285 for the year. The household includes anyone you claim or could claim on your tax return, Buchholz said. If you had coverage part of the year, this amount is prorated and only charged for months without coverage.\n\nUnder the percentage of income, you subtract your filing threshold (the maximum income you can have before you have to file a tax return) from your modified adjusted gross income and take 1 percent of the remainder.\n\nA single person with $50,000 in income would subtract $10,150 (the filing threshold) and pay 1 percent of the difference, which works out to a penalty of $399. This fine is also prorated and applied to months without coverage.\n\nHowever, no one will have to pay more than the average national cost of a bronze level plan. For 2014, this cost is $204 a month for an individual but goes up with family size up to five people.\n\nA single person who lacked coverage for 12 months would pay $399 because it is higher than the flat amount ($95) but does not exceed the bronze level plan ($2,448), Buchholz said.\n\nFor 2015, the penalty is $325 per person or 2 percent of income, whichever is higher, up to next year\u2019s cost of a bronze-level plan.\n\nAlthough most people without coverage will find a way out, \u201cI imagine there are some people who have an offer of affordable coverage but decide they don\u2019t want to spend their money that way and will pay\u201d a penalty, said Laurel Lucia, a policy analyst with the UC Berkeley Labor Center.\n\nThose most likely to pay are those who are just above the 400 percent of poverty and don\u2019t qualify for a premium subsidy.\n\nKathleen Pender is a San Francisco Chronicle columnist.
