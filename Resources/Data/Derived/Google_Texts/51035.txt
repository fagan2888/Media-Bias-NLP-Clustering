Roy owned and operated Selectcare Health, an outpatient physical and respiratory therapy provider in Park Ridge and Skokie, Illinois. He proposed the scheme to two co-defendants as a means to extricate them from debt, and designed it to avoid raising red flags with Medicare and Blue Cross Blue Shield’s fraud detection systems, according to court documents.

Medicare and Blue Cross Blue Shield paid the defendants more than $2.5 million in false claims for services never provided, according to the U.S. Attorney. Roy took over $600,000 for his own purposes, including for personal expenses, paying off credit card bills and repaying his student loan, according to the U.S. Attorney.
