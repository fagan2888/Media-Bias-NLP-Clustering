The death of the CEO of the Broward Health system by a self-inflicted gunshot wound has left colleagues in a state of shock.

Nabil El Sanadi, M.D., 60, served as the CEO of one of the country's largest health systems for the past year and also as its chief of emergency medicine. He shot himself Saturday at his home in Florida, about 10 days after undergoing triple bypass surgery, the Sun Sentinel reported. He didn't leave a note so friends and colleagues could only spectulate on the reasons why he decided to take his own life.

"It's a shock to all of us who knew him, and a great loss to everybody in the community. He was so upbeat. He had his dream job," Fort Lauderdale attorney Bill Scherer told the newspaper in a follow-up story.

Sanadi's death is a loss not only to the health system, but to the whole community, David Di Pietro, chairman of the board of the Broward Health system, told the Sun Sentinel.

"He was a true leader, trusted friend and colleague," Bruce Rueben, president of the Florida Hospital Association, told the Miami Herald in a statement. "Dr. El Sanadi was a tireless advocate for patient safety and better access to high-quality healthcare services for all."

In an emailed statement to FierceHealthcare, Tony Carvalho, president of the Safety Net Hospital Alliance of Florida, said the community was deeply saddened to learn about Sanadi's death. Sanadi, he said, was an active member of the alliance board. "Both his contributions and his friendship will be missed," he said.

Chief Operating Officer Kevin Fusco will serve as acting CEO and the district board will meet Wednesday to discuss its next steps, the Sun Sentinel reported.
