However, along with the cancellation notice she received the check she sent to make her premium payment. Demartin, like 70 percent of those purchasing insurance through the exchange, receive a subsidy from the federal government for a portion of their monthly premium.\n\nIf she paid her portion of the bill is it possible Uncle Sam just failed to pay the difference?\n\nFrustrated with the lack of answers she was getting from Access Health CT, Demartin reached out to her elected representatives, including Sen. Leonard Fasano.\n\nFasano and House Minority Leader Lawrence Cafero wrote Access Health CT\u2019s CEO Kevin Counihan earlier this week asking for an explanation, because Demartin wasn\u2019t the only constituent to inform them a plan had been canceled.\n\nUnable to explain what had happened, Fasano and Cafero asked Counihan for an explanation.\n\n\u201cWhat is the source of the problem; how many people have been so affected; how will the issue be addressed so that coverage can be restore?\u201d wrote Fasano and Cafero.\n\nIn a June 17 response, Counihan says his office has \u201creceived no such complaints of this sort.\u201d Counihan was referring to the cancellation of policies due to the nonpayment of federal subsidies.\n\nIn a phone call last Friday, Counihan said they were looking into Demartin\u2019s case file, but he said he didn\u2019t have a good answer as to why her plan would have been canceled if she was paying her premium.\n\nDemartin said that\u2019s odd because she calls the Access Health CT offices on an almost daily basis seeking answers. She said she has never received a phone call back from the center, which she said seems to dutifully take your information and give you a reference number that you provide to them the next time you call.\n\nDemartin said she has four unpaid doctor bills and a CAT scan, which was pre-authorized by her insurance carrier, Anthem. However, Anthem said she\u2019s no longer insured so they won\u2019t pay it. She has re-applied for insurance and was supposed to hear back.\n\nA spokeswoman for Anthem said none of their clients who are subsidized by the federal government have been canceled.\n\nBut what about Demartin?\n\nIt\u2019s possible the form Access Health CT sent over to Anthem detailing the amount of the subsidy the company would receive from the federal government was wrong.\n\nThe income data a client gives to Access Health CT is verified with the Internal Revenue Service before the information is sent over to the insurance carrier. There have been some problems with the way in which the information is transmitted to the insurance carriers, but the two other insurance carriers participating in the exchange say they aren\u2019t experiencing the same problems.\n\n\u201cAnthem has not and would not cancel a member entitled to a federal subsidy on the basis of not receiving the applicable subsidy payment from the federal government,\u201d Sarah Yeager, an Anthem spokeswoman, said in an emailed statement last week.\n\nYeager continued: \u201cMembers may be cancelled on the basis of a member\u2019s failure to pay their portion of any premium due after the expiration of the applicable grace period. On the occasion that we have subsequently received updated information indicating that the member was entitled to a federal subsidy, we have worked quickly and diligently to reinstate the member and cover them retroactively.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s possible Anthem had no idea Demartin was supposed to be receiving a subsidy based on the information it received from Access Health CT.\n\nConnecticut Republican leaders, who have been critical of Obamacare, want to know how many more residents are in the same situation as Demartin.\n\nState Healthcare Advocate Victoria Veltri said Monday that she didn\u2019t think the situation was widespread. However, there have been cases where the wrong subsidy amount was reported to the insurance carrier or no subsidy was reported to the carrier and the client was billed for the wrong amount.\n\nCounihan admitted that it could happen where a wrong amount was reported, because every time a change is made to an application it generates a new 834 form. But he maintained that he hasn\u2019t heard of anyone losing coverage because the federal government failed to pay the subsidy to the carrier.\n\nCounihan said he would look into Demartin\u2019s case and talk with the carrier to try and figure out what\u2019s happening.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re Gail you don\u2019t care about how widespread the problem is you just want it solved,\u201d Counihan said.", "article_metadata": {"publisher": "CT News Junkie", "og": {"url": "http://www.ctnewsjunkie.com/archives/entry/access_health_ct_looking_into_north_haven_womans_policy_cancellation/", "type": "article", "site_name": "CT News Junkie", "description": "Gail Demartin of North Haven paid her monthly premiums for her insurance she purchased through Connecticut\u2019s health insurance exchange, but she received notice that her plan was canceled on March 8.", "title": "Access Health CT Looking Into North Haven Woman\u2019s Policy Cancellation | CT News Junkie"}, "robots": "index,follow,archive", "fb": {"admins": 100000516708778, "app_id": 625264840857145}, "google-site-verification": "xSWCEDPXS2srINlbzkJoWA5QowbCkai3awnZqgts9xc", "viewport": "width=1474"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0ed1\"", "article_summary": "Frustrated with the lack of answers she was getting from Access Health CT, Demartin reached out to her elected representatives, including Sen.
