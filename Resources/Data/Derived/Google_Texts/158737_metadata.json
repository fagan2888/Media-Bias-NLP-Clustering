Summary Republican presidential candidates debated once again on economic issues and offered some misleading takes on jobs, tax plans, immigrants and state budgets. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio said that \u201cwelders make more money than philosophers.\u201d Actually, those with undergraduate degrees in philosophy earn a higher median income than welders.\n\nBusinessman Donald Trump said that President Dwight D. Eisenhower had forced out 1.5 million immigrants who were in the country illegally. The federal government claimed it was 1.3 million, but historians say that\u2019s exaggerated.\n\nTexas Sen. Ted Cruz said the Tax Foundation calculated that his tax plan \u201ccosts less than virtually every other plan people have put up here, and yet it produces more growth.\u201d But the foundation said Bobby Jindal\u2019s and Rubio\u2019s plans both would lead to higher gross domestic product growth over a decade.\n\nCruz also repeated the years-long falsehood that there\u2019s a \u201ccongressional exemption\u201d from Obamacare. Members of Congress and their staffs face additional requirements than other Americans, not fewer.\n\nLouisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal said that his state has had \u201ceight credit upgrades,\u201d but two credit rating agencies moved the state to a \u201cnegative\u201d outlook in February. And it faces a $117 million deficit in its most recent budget.\n\nFormer Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee said he had cut his state budget by 11 percent during the 2001-2003 recession. Over his entire tenure, however, spending went up by 50 percent.\n\nJindal claimed that there were \u201cmore people working in Louisiana than ever before.\u201d That\u2019s wrong. There were fewer Louisianans working in September than there were in December 2014.\n\nHuckabee said that Syrians make up only 20 percent of the refugees arriving in Europe. The figure is actually 52 percent for 2015. Analysis In the Fox Business News debate held Nov. 10 in Milwaukee, only eight candidates took to the main stage \u2014 Donald Trump, Dr. Ben Carson, Sen. Marco Rubio, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina, Sen. Ted Cruz, Ohio Gov. John Kasich and Sen. Rand Paul. Four more Republicans debated earlier that evening: New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, former U.S. Sen. Rick Santorum and Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal.\n\nGetty\n\nPhilosophers Better Paid Than Welders Rubio proposed increasing vocational education opportunities for high school students, but he went too far when he said that \u201cwelders make more money than philosophers.\u201d Typically, they do not. Rubio: For the life of me, I don\u2019t know why we have stigmatized vocational education. Welders make more money than philosophers. We need more welders and less philosophers. The Wall Street Journal, a cohost of the debate, published a chart on undergraduate degrees that \u201cpay you back,\u201d and prominently mentioned philosophy majors. The Journal wrote, \u201cYour parents might have worried when you chose Philosophy or International Relations as a major. But a year-long survey of 1.2 million people with only a bachelor\u2019s degree by PayScale Inc. shows that graduates in these subjects earned 103.5% and 97.8% more, respectively, about 10 years post-commencement\u201d than they had earned right out of college. PayScale\u2019s latest data, for 2015-16, show that the median starting salary for a worker holding a philosophy degree is $42,200, rising to $85,000 after 10 years. By contrast, the median income for a welder with zero to 5 years experience is $38,728, increasing to $44,498 after 10 years, according to PayScale. Similarly, the Bureau of Labor Statistics says the median annual wage was $63,630 for a philosophy and religion teacher as of May 2014, and $36,300 for welders, cutters, solders and brazers as of 2012. Trump Invokes \u2018Operation Wetback\u2019 Trump, defending his promise to deport millions of immigrants in the country illegally, cited the actions of President Dwight D. Eisenhower: Trump: Let me just tell you that Dwight Eisenhower, good president, great president. \u2026 Moved a 1.5 million illegal immigrants out of this country. \u2026 You don\u2019t get nicer. You don\u2019t get friendlier. They moved a 1.5 million out. We have no choice. We have no choice. It\u2019s true that during a 1954 effort that was officially known as \u201cOperation Wetback\u201d (a term that many today find offensive), the federal government claimed to have forced as many as 1.3 million people to return to Mexico, but historians consider that number to be exaggerated. Texas State Historical Association: It is difficult to estimate the number of people forced to leave by the operation. The INS [Immigration and Naturalization Service] claimed as many as 1,300,000, though the number officially apprehended did not come anywhere near this total. The INS estimate rested on the claim that most undocumented immigrants, fearing apprehension by the government, had voluntarily repatriated themselves before and during the operation. Trump also claimed that those forced to return \u201cnever came back\u201d after being moved \u201cway down south\u201d rather than just across the border. According to historian Mae M. Ngai, in her book \u201cImpossible Subjects: Illegal Aliens and the Making of Modern America,\u201d many of those deported were simply transported a few miles across the border and left in the desert, but more than 25 percent were transported to the Mexican coastal city of Veracruz on hired cargo ships. A congressional investigation later likened one of the ships to \u201can eighteenth century slave ship,\u201d Ngai wrote. Worth noting is that after the operation was concluded, border officials declared that \u201c[t]he so-called \u2018wetback\u2019 problem no longer exists,\u201d and that \u201c[t]he border has been secured.\u201d That, of course, turned out to be wishful thinking. Cruz\u2019s Tax Plan Boast Cruz said that according to the Tax Foundation, his tax plan \u201ccosts less than virtually every other plan people have put up here, and yet it produces more growth.\u201d Actually, among the tax plans of seven Republican candidates that it analyzed, the Tax Foundation concluded that the gross domestic product would grow more over the next decade under two other plans \u2014 from Bobby Jindal and Marco Rubio. The Tax Foundation also concluded that Rubio\u2019s plan would lead to higher wage and capital investment growth. Cruz\u2019s tax plan calls for a 10 percent flat tax on individual income, though for a family of four, the first $36,000 would be tax-free. On the business end, the corporate income tax and payroll taxes would be eliminated and replaced with a \u201cbusiness flat tax\u201d of 16 percent. Cruz correctly noted that the Tax Foundation concluded that under a \u201cstatic\u201d basis, the plan would reduce revenues by $3.6 trillion over 10 years. But under \u201cdynamic\u201d scoring \u2014 accounting for the economic growth the Tax Foundation expects his plan would spur \u2014 it estimates the plan would only reduce revenues by about $768 billion. That means it is estimated to cost less than every other Republican plan analyzed by the Tax Foundation,except for Rand Paul\u2019s (which it estimates would increase revenues by $737 billion). But Cruz was wrong to say the Tax Foundation found his plan produces the most growth. According to the Tax Foundation, Cruz\u2019s plan would grow the GDP by 13.9 percent over the next 10 years. But the Tax Foundation concluded that Jindal\u2019s plan would grow the GDP by 14.4 percent, and Rubio\u2019s plan would grow the GDP by 15 percent. The Tax Foundation also found that Cruz\u2019s tax plan would lead to 10-year capital investment growth of 43.9 percent, and to 10-year wage rate growth of 12.2 percent. That\u2019s lower than the projected growth from Rubio\u2019s plan of 48.9 percent for capital investment and 12.5 percent for the wage rate.\n\nGetty\n\nCruz Repeats \u2018Exempt\u2019 Whopper Cruz repeated the long-running myth that Congress is \u201cexempt\u201d from Obamacare. Lawmakers and their staffs actually face additional requirements that other Americans don\u2019t, thanks to a Republican amendment. Cruz: And, I\u2019ll give you an example of that, which is the Congressional exemption from Obamacare, which is fundamentally wrong, and I\u2019ll tell you this, if I\u2019m elected president, I will veto any statute that exempts members of congress. The law should apply evenly to every American. Unlike other Americans who get their insurance through their employers, members of Congress are now barred from directly doing so. As of 2014, they can no longer get health coverage through the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, as they and other federal employees have done for years. Because of a Republican amendment added to the law, members are required to get their insurance through the Affordable Care Act\u2019s insurance marketplaces. Before that amendment, the legislation said that federal employees, employees of large companies, and those who get insurance through Medicare or Medicaid wouldn\u2019t be eligible for the marketplaces, which were designed for individuals buying their own insurance. That gave rise to the false notion that Congress was somehow \u201cexempt\u201d from the law. But lawmakers were being treated just like other workers with employer-provided insurance. And they were required to have insurance or face a penalty, just like everyone else. But even after the amendment put Congress in the ACA marketplaces, the \u201cexempt\u201d claim lived on. The federal government had long made premium contributions to pay for part of federal employees\u2019 health insurance, including the insurance of members of Congress and their staffs \u2014 just like other employers do. And in August 2013, the Office of Personnel Management, which administers the FEHB Program, said that the federal government could continue to make those premium contributions for Congress, even though members were getting insurance through the marketplaces. OPM said the contribution couldn\u2019t be greater than what\u2019s made under the FEHB Program. Republicans claimed, once again, that this made Congress \u201cexempt\u201d from the law \u2014 even though lawmakers were getting the same employer contributions they got before, but faced the requirement of getting new coverage through the marketplaces. Louisiana\u2019s Finances Not So Rosy Jindal painted a rosy picture of his state\u2019s fiscal situation. Attacking New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, he said: \u201cIn New Jersey, you\u2019ve had nine credit downgrades, setting a record. We\u2019ve had eight credit upgrades in Louisiana.\u201d Jindal is right about New Jersey. But Louisiana\u2019s finances are not as good as the governor suggests. According to the New Orleans Times-Picayune, two credit rating agencies \u2014 Moody\u2019s and Standard & Poor\u2019s \u2014 moved Louisiana from a \u201cstable\u201d to a \u201cnegative\u201d outlook in February. \u201cBoth agencies held off on downgrading the state\u2019s credit rating at this time, but a \u2018negative\u2019 outlook does leave the state vulnerable to a future drop,\u201d the newspaper reported. More recently, the Associated Press reported that the state ended its most recent budget year with a $117 million deficit, which by law must be made up before the next budget year begins. \u201cLouisiana has faced repeated budget shortfalls during Jindal\u2019s two terms in office, a combination of the economic downturn and the cost of tax breaks that have siphoned more dollars away from the state treasury than expected,\u201d the AP reported. \u201cRather than match state spending to income, the governor and lawmakers have raided savings accounts, sold property and used other short-term fixes to patch together budgets. But that creates new gaps each year.\u201d Huckabee on Cutting Arkansas Budget Huckabee repeated a claim he made during the 2008 presidential campaign, saying that when he was governor of Arkansas \u201cwe ended up cutting 11 percent out of the state budget through that [2001-2003] recession.\u201d Jindal countered that \u201cspending in Arkansas went up 65 percent\u201d under Huckabee. Huckabee cherry-picks from his two terms to make his claim. Jindal is close, but doesn\u2019t adjust for inflation. Spending in Arkansas went up by 50 percent in inflation-adjusted dollars over Huckabee\u2019s time overseeing the state budget. We checked Huckabee\u2019s 11 percent claim before \u2014 way back in January 2008 in a Republican presidential debate. The head of the Arkansas Budget Office told us it was \u201ccertainly plausible\u201d that the cuts amounted to 11 percent of the budget in fiscal 2002 \u2014 a year for which a glitch in the state record-keeping system made accessing data difficult. But the better measure of Huckabee\u2019s record is his entire time in office. In inflation-adjusted dollars, spending went from $10.4 billion in fiscal year 1998, the first budget under Huckabee\u2019s responsibility, to $15.6 billion by the end of 2006. Jindal accurately cited a figure from a Cato Institute commentary piece. But using inflation-adjusted figures, the increase was less than 65 percent.\n\nBloomberg via Getty Images Bobby Jindal, governor of Louisiana and 2016 Republican presidential candidate, speaks during a Republican presidential candidate debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, U.S., on Tuesday, Nov. 10, 2015.\n\nMilwaukee Fox Business GOP Debate\n\nMilwaukee Fox Business GOP Debate\n\n1 of 35 House Speaker Paul Ryan watches the Republican Presidential Debate sponsored by Fox Business and the Wall Street Journal at the Milwaukee Theatre November 10, 2015 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
