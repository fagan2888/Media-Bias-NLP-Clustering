Arbitrator James Oldham made that ruling Friday.\n\n\u201cThe message in reducing the suspension that is sent to NHL players, as well as athletes all over the world, including children, is that the code of conduct towards officials has changed,\u201d the NHLOA said.\n\nWideman struck Don Henderson during the second period of a game against Nashville on Jan. 27. Both finished the game but were diagnosed with concussions.\n\nAvs Mailbag: Pose a question for Terry Frei, Mike Chambers\n\n\u201cBoth of them testified that they can remember almost nothing about what happened during the minutes immediately after their heads hit the glass or the boards,\u201d Oldham wrote in his 18-page opinion.\n\nHenderson hit his head on the boards on the way down. At Wideman\u2019s disciplinary hearing, Henderson testified that he felt as if he \u201cgot hit by a bus.\u201d\n\nThe NHL suspended Wideman 20 games for abuse of officials, and Commissioner Gary Bettman upheld that number on appeal. Oldham reduced it to 10 games, citing a lack of evidence that Wideman intended to injure Henderson.\n\nEven though Wideman served 19 games of the suspension, the reduction does not sit well with officials. He will get back $282,258 of the $564,516 he was going to forfeit as a result of the suspension.\n\n\u201cThe NHLOA intends to take all steps necessary so that its members are protected in the future and ensure that this type of conduct by a player against an official never happens again,\u201d the association said.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "NHL linesman hit by Dennis Wideman out for season with a concussion", "title": "NHL linesman hit by Dennis Wideman out for season with a concussion", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/03/12/nhl-linesman-hit-by-dennis-wideman-out-for-season-with-a-concussion/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2016-03-12T11:20:24+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-12T11:20:24+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The linesman knocked to the ice by Calgary Flames defenseman Dennis Wideman in January is still recovering from the concussion he suffered and is out for the season, according to the NHL Officials Association.\nEven though Wideman served 19 games of the suspension, the reduction does not sit well with officials.\nOldham reduced it to 10 games, citing a lack of evidence that Wideman intended to injure Henderson.\nHe will get back $282,258 of the $564,516 he was going to forfeit as a result of the suspension.\nAt Wideman\u2019s disciplinary hearing, Henderson testified that he felt as if he \u201cgot hit by a bus.\u201dThe NHL suspended Wideman 20 games for abuse of officials, and Commissioner Gary Bettman upheld that number on appeal."}
