Rand Paul of Kentucky, Ted Cruz of Texas, Marco Rubio of Florida and other Tea Party favorites mulling presidential races. Because Romney and Bush would be appealing to essentially the same base of voters, their positions on key issues may be decisive in determining which one survives a grueling campaign.\n\nThough both have evolved in their positions over the years, here is a summary of where they stand right now on seven key issues:\n\nCommon Core/Education\n\nBush: He is a solid advocate of the Common Core, the new standards adopted by 45 states and D.C. to boost academic achievement and allow for comparisons across states. Most potential GOP presidential contenders have denounced the program as Russian-style centralized government or unnecessary meddling in local and state concerns.\n\nRelated: Jeb Bush Stands Firm on Common Core\n\nRomney: He\u2019s staunchly opposed to Common Core. During his 2012 presidential campaign, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t subscribe to the idea of the federal government trying to push a common core on various states . . . To financially reward states based upon accepting the federal government\u2019s idea of a curriculum, I think, is a mistake.\u201d\n\nSame-Sex Marriage\n\nBush: He argued in 1994 that gay people did not deserve special legal protection and that \u201csodomy\u201d should not be \u201celevated to the same constitutional status as race and religion.\u201d Now, Bush says that people should accept court rulings that legalize same-sex marriage and \u201cshow respect\u201d for gays in committed relationships. At the same time, he restated his long-held belief that \u201cmarriage is a sacrament.\u201d\n\nRomney: He opposes legalizing same-sex marriage. Last February, he reaffirmed his support for traditional marriage on Meet the Press, saying, \u201cI think marriage is a relationship between a man and a woman\u2026 And I think the ideal setting for raising a child is in a setting where there\u2019s a father and mother.\u201d\n\nImmigration Reform/Amnesty\n\nBush: His views on this have been a work in progress, beginning with his harsh declaration in 1994 that the government should \u201cstart deporting\u201d illegal immigrants. At one time, he wrote a grant of citizenship to illegals was an \u201cundeserving reward for conduct we cannot afford to encourage. Recently, Bush \u2013 whose wife Columba is a Mexican-born American \u2013 has taken a more flexible stand. \u201cYes, they broke the law, but it\u2019s not a felony,\u201d he said of illegal immigrants in April 2014. \u201cIt\u2019s an act of love, an act of commitment to your family.\u201d\n\nRelated: Fight Over Obama\u2019s Immigration Order Shows Cracks in GOP Armor\n\n\n\nRomney: In 2012, he advocated illegal immigrants consider \u201cself-deportation,\u201d a pronouncement not received well by Hispanics. Romney garnered about 27 percent of the Hispanic vote in the general election. He since seems to have altered his stance: In May, he told a crowd at a campaign rally for then-candidate and now Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa that Congress must pass immigration reform by 2016.\n\nAbortion Rights\n\nBush: Throughout his governorship, Bush highlighted his staunch social conservatism, particularly in opposing embryonic stem cell research and abortion rights. He signed into law a parental notification measure for teenage girls considering abortion and supported a controversial \u201cchoose life\u201d specialty license plate. In 2003, he asked a court to appoint a representative for the fetus of a mentally disabled rape victim. That same year, Bush launched a nearly two-year crusade to keep alive Terri Schiavo, a brain-damaged woman whose family battled in court over whether to terminate her life support.\n\n\n\nRomney: Up until 2011, Romney publicly declared himself pro-life, said he didn\u2019t support federally funding abortions and advocated overturning Roe v. Wade. After winning the GOP nomination in 2012, he said he wouldn\u2019t make abortion legislation part of his presidential agenda \u2013 a move to appeal to female voters, critics said.\n\nGlobal Warming\n\nBush: Despite mounting evidence that climate change threatens the environment, Bush has long been a skeptic. \u201cI think global warming may be real,\u201d he said in a 2011 Fox interview. He added there is a dispute among scientists as to the source of the problem. His views haven\u2019t changed much since then, and he says he fears that harsh restrictions on carbon emissions would harm the U.S. industrial base.\n\nRelated: Pope Francis to Convert Catholics on Global Warming\n\n\n\nRomney: He waivered on how he would address the threat of climate change. He\u2019s acknowledged the planet is warming up and something must be done to address it, yet he hasn\u2019t publicly accepted the cause of global warming and is staunchly opposed to President Obama\u2019s executive actions to reduce carbon emissions. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what\u2019s causing climate change on this planet, and the idea of spending trillions and trillions of dollars to try and reduce CO2 emissions is not the right course for us\u201d he said during the 2012 presidential campaign.\n\nForeign Policy/Defense\n\nBush: Like his father and brother, Jeb Bush is a staunch foreign policy interventionist who has been critical of Obama\u2019s defense and foreign policy stewardship. In a recent speech, he complained the U.S. has been steadily pulling back or retrenching. He sounded notes of concerns on nearly every quarter of the world, including Russia, China, Venezuela, Iran, Iraq and Afghanistan, according to The Miami Herald. He joined other Florida politicians in condemning Obama\u2019s decision to restore diplomatic relations with Cuba.\n\n\n\nRomney: He has publicly supported the use of \u201cboots on the ground\u201d to address the growing threat of ISIS in Iraq and Syria. He\u2019s been extremely critical of Obama\u2019s action to combat ISIS and told CBS\u2019s Face the Nation more must be done: \u201cWhen the president says, for instance, that ISIS is a cancer and it must be eliminated, he\u2019s right. But you don\u2019t say, \u2018Well, we\u2019re only going to use the following tools in doing so.\u2019 You say, \u2018We\u2019re going to do whatever it takes.\u2019\u201d Romney has also been highly critical of Obama\u2019s defense cuts. In 2012, he campaigned to increase the size of the Pentagon\u2019s budget, saying he wanted to increase the military\u2019s size by at least 100,000 troops.\n\nHealth Insurance/Obamacare\n\nBush: For years Bush has called the Affordable Care Act \u201cflawed to its core\u201d and a big political problem for Democrats. Unlike other Republicans who have repeatedly called for repeal or dismantlement, Bush has counseled standing back and basically letting the health insurance program collapse of its own weight. He says Republicans should rally round an alternative program with a much lower cost and improved quality based on free market principles.\n\nRomney: He has routinely criticized Obamacare, which was largely modeled after his own health care plan in Massachusetts when he was governor. In a 2012 op-ed in USA Today, Romney called for repealing Obamacare \u2013 saying the program was \u201can unfolding disaster for the American economy, a budget-busting entitlement, and a dramatic new federal intrusion into our lives.\u201d Instead of Obamacare, Romney says health care reform should be done at the state level. \u201cWhat we need is a free market, federalist approach to making quality, affordable health insurance available to every American.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Almost overnight, former governors Mitt Romney\u00a0of Massachusetts and Jeb Bush of Florid", "title": "Romney vs. Bush: Where They Stand on 7 Key Issues", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/01/15/Romney-vs-Bush-Where-They-Stand-7-Key-Issues", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/01122015_Mitt_Romney_Jeb_Bush_Split-1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/01/15/Romney-vs-Bush-Where-They-Stand-7-Key-Issues", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/01122015_Mitt_Romney_Jeb_Bush_Split-1.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Almost overnight, former governors Mitt Romney\u00a0of Massachusetts and Jeb Bush of Florid", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce111\"", "article_summary": "Because Romney and Bush would be appealing to essentially the same base of voters, their positions on key issues may be decisive in determining which one survives a grueling campaign.\nMost potential GOP presidential contenders have denounced the program as Russian-style centralized government or unnecessary meddling in local and state concerns.\nRelated: Mitt Romney vs. Jeb Bush: The 2016 Fundraising Fight Has StartedRomney, 67, and Bush, 61, both formidable strategists and fundraisers with strong name recognition, can be expected to dominate the GOP presidential field, at least in the early going.\nRomney: Up until 2011, Romney publicly declared himself pro-life, said he didn\u2019t support federally funding abortions and advocated overturning Roe v.
