The foundation described a priest\u2019s pro-life advocacy as a violation of the church\u2019s tax status and demanded that the IRS enforce its ban on politicking from the pulpit. The case ended up being dismissed\u2014at the foundation\u2019s request\u2014by a Wisconsin federal judge.\n\nThe Freedom From Religion Foundation had requested the dismissal of its own lawsuit because it was assured by the IRS that the agency would adopt new protocols and procedures for church investigations, according to a press release from the foundation. All Alliance Defending Freedom wants to know is what those protocols and procedures are, Stanley said.\n\nAlliance Defending Freedom filed a Freedom of Information Act request for access to IRS documents in 2014. More than 10,000 of the 16,000 requested pages were withheld, and more than 2,000 were almost entirely blacked out when the IRS responded to the request in July 2015, according to Alliance Defending Freedom. Stanley said they are pursuing legal action, as the IRS rendered the request \u201cuseless.\u201d\n\nCongress passed a bill in 1984 placing statutory restrictions on the IRS\u2019 \u201cinquiries and examinations on church tax status or tax liabilities.\u201d A Minnesota church successfully challenged the agency\u2019s procedures in a 2009 court battle, yet the IRS has failed to update its regulations since, Stanley told The Daily Signal.\n\n\u201cSince 2009, we have no public acknowledgement from the IRS that they are following those procedures,\u201d Stanley said. \u201cAnd yet \u2026 by the IRS\u2019 own admission, it\u2019s still auditing churches. So we have no assurances that the IRS is treating churches the way that Congress mandated, in order to protect their constitutional rights.\u201d\n\nStanley said the IRS should be more transparent after its history of problems with auditing churches and what he described as the agency\u2019s \u201cpolitically motivated abuse of power,\u201d such as the agency\u2019s targeting of the Tea Party.\n\n>>>IRS Documents Reveal Washington\u2019s Role in Targeting Tea Party Groups\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s really what this boils down to, is if [the IRS] can tell us that they are respecting the constitutional rights of churches when they are auditing them\u2014that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to get to the bottom of. And there should be no reason why the IRS should be cagey about that at all,\u201d Stanley said.\n\nThe IRS did not respond to The Daily Signal\u2019s request for comment.\n\nNote: In 2014, Mariana Barillas attended Alliance Defending Freedom\u2019s Collegiate Academy, now called the Aret\u00e9 Academy.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\u201cWe have no assurances that the IRS is treating churches the way that Congress mandated,\u201d an attorney says.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "\u201cWe have no assurances that the IRS is treating churches the way that Congress mandated,\u201d an attorney says.", "title": "How Is the IRS Auditing Churches?
