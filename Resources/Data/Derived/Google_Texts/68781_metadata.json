That\u2019s because health cooperatives \u2014 large, low-cost insurers set up as part of Obamacare \u2014 are folding in a dozen states.\n\nThe failure of Colorado\u2019s co-op has hit Rick and Letha Heitman hard. They are currently customers of the Colorado HealthOP, which is closing up shop at the end of the year. The couple, who own a contracting business, say the co-op proved to be a life-saver when Rick was diagnosed with aggressive prostate cancer last spring.\n\n\u201cI owe them for taking care of me. They helped me at a time when I needed it a lot,\u201d he says.\n\nAbout 80,000 people are in the same boat as the Heitmans, on the hunt for new insurance plans on Colorado\u2019s exchange. HealthOP\u2019s CEO Julia Hutchins says the co-op got walloped by the equivalent of a fast-moving tornado after the federal government said it wouldn\u2019t be paying co-ops millions in subsidies they had expected.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe were really blindsided by that,\u201d she says. \u201cWe felt like we\u2019d done our part in helping serve individuals who really need insurance and now we\u2019re the one left holding the bag.\u201d\n\nAnd, she insists the co-op was on track to be profitable. Colorado HealthOp is one of 23 nationally in 22 states that opened after Obamacare was enacted. The startups were supposed to shake up the traditional marketplace by being member-owned and nonprofit, but it was tough to figure out how much to charge. They needed to estimate how much medical care their customers would use, and they had to do that without data from previous years and without the cushion of a reserve fund. Established insurers can use reserves and experience to recover if they underestimate premium prices in a given year.\n\nMany co-op plans were priced low, and customers poured in. But these new customers had high health costs, so the health insurance co-ops had to start paying a lot of bills. The math didn\u2019t add up. On top of that, they were counting on a variety of funding streams from the federal government, and not all of them materialized.\n\nLinda Gorman, with the Independence Institute, a conservative-leaning Colorado think tank, says the new co-ops were in over their heads.\n\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t go into business counting on federal subsidies,\u201d she says. \u201cThe notion that you should beat up on for-profit entities and then form these nonprofits and everything will be magically OK is unfortunate to begin with. We\u2019ve wasted a lot of taxpayer money on that.\u201d\n\nBut the HealthOP\u2019s senior IT manager Helen Hadji, a Republican, blames conservatives in Congress for not authorizing the money needed to keep the cooperatives afloat.\n\n\u201cThis is a federal failure,\u201d she says. \u201cThis is all a political battle to dismantle Obamacare.\u201d\n\nColorado\u2019s co-op captured 40 percent of the individual market on the state\u2019s exchange. Now as customers, like the Heitmans, hunt for new insurance, they are finding higher prices: They paid about $500 a month last year. Next year, it could be double or triple that.\n\n\u201cYou know, that\u2019s a big \u2018owee!\u2019\u201d says Letha Heitman.\n\nBut it\u2019s the price they\u2019ll pay to keep Rick with the doctors who are treating his cancer.\n\nIn Connecticut, the opposite story is playing out. If Colorado saw an early surge in membership because of low prices, Connecticut\u2019s co-op nearly priced itself out of the market in its first year. With rates much higher than its competitors, HealthyCT only got 3 percent of the state\u2019s business under the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cIn that first year, the reason we had such low market share was that consumers \u2014 new to the industry, new to insurance \u2014 most of those individuals bought on price,\u201d says Ken Lalime, who runs the co-op.\n\nAnd, he says, starting it was hard.\n\n\u201cNobody\u2019s built a new insurance company in the state of Connecticut in 30 years,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s no book that you pull off the shelf and say, \u2018Let\u2019s go do this.\u2019\u201d\n\nLalime faced the same problem as insurers across the country: He didn\u2019t know who his customers would be, he didn\u2019t know whether they\u2019d be sick or healthy, and he didn\u2019t know how much to charge. It turns out he ended up charging too much.\n\nBut even though that meant relatively few signups in year one, the slow ramp-up actually helped. He didn\u2019t have a huge number of claims to pay right out of the gate, and the ones he did pay didn\u2019t break the bank.\n\n\u201cHindsight, yes, that didn\u2019t hurt us. To be able to take it slowly,\u201d he says.\n\nIn year two, he had more competitive average premiums \u2014 and his company went from 3 percent market share to 18 percent. For 2016, HealthyCT and the state \u2014 after some back and forth \u2014 settled on a 7 percent premium hike for customers.\n\nPaul Lombardo is an actuary for the state. He says that bouncing around is an indicator that setting premiums under the Affordable Care Act is still a bit of a gamble. That\u2019s in part because there\u2019s still no good data. So few people signed up with HealthyCT in the beginning that they didn\u2019t have enough information to help set 2016 premiums.\n\n\u201cThere wasn\u2019t a lot of data to say, OK, we can use 2014 experience to project forward,\u201d Lombardo says.\n\nFor now, at least, Lombardo says HealthyCT is holding its own.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re in good standing,\u201d he says. \u201cThe premium we think that we\u2019re setting for 2016 \u2014 albeit a little bit higher than they wanted it to be on the revision \u2014 is appropriate.\u201d\n\nEnrollment for health insurance in the co-ops runs through Jan. 31 with just 11 of the original 23 co-ops still in business.\n\nThis story is part of a reporting partnership with NPR, Colorado Public Radio, WNPR and Kaiser Health News.\n\nPhoto: Flickr user Chris Potter", "article_metadata": {"description": "One take: You shouldn\u2019t go into business counting on federal subsidies", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "MedCity News", "description": "One take: You shouldn\u2019t go into business counting on federal subsidies", "title": "A deeper look at health insurance co-ops that fail (and succeed)", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://medcitynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/successfailure_flickr_chrispotter.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-01-06T11:49:36-04:00", "url": "http://medcitynews.com/2015/11/health-insurance-co-ops-update/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://medcitynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/successfailure_flickr_chrispotter.jpg", "description": "One take: You shouldn\u2019t go into business counting on federal subsidies", "card": "summary", "title": "A deeper look at health insurance co-ops that fail (and succeed) - MedCity News"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 148725768475669}, "google-site-verification": "xudQg7nxVR9ifmMTY4Tf-0wVtX9b6rWLQd0utCweGOc", "keywords": "weight loss, obesity, overweight,diabetes,massachusetts,medical devices,obesity,startups,healthcare innovation, medcity news,medcity news,san francisco, startups, life sciences,accelerator,rock health,startup advice,startup funding,patient monitoring system, motion sensors ,dc,healthcare it,washington,foodborne pathogens, diagnostics company, diagnostic platforms,minimally invasive surgery, laser surgery,cambridge,dealflow,hospitals,wellpoint, healthways, health and wellness, employee wellness programs,investing,wellness,medtronic, shanghai innovation center, china, r&d,china,mdt,minneapolis,minnesota,publics,twin cities,ulcerative colitis, abbott labs, humira,abbott labs,doctors,pharmaceuticals,skin disorders, pharmaceuticals, md anderson cancer center,cancer,texas,renal denervation, st. jude medical,st. jude medical,stj,emr, ehr, electronic health records, electronic medical records, certified emr,certified emr,ehr,electronic health records,electronic medical records,advanced cellular technology,amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,embryonic stem cells,geron corporation,lou gehrig\\'s disease,macular degeneration,regenerative medicine,spinal cord damage,value-based healthcare system, obamacare, fee-for-service model,california,cleveland,health insurance,insurance,ohio,pennsylvania,politics,cancer treatment options library, aetna, aet, healthcare it,aet,aetna,health it,phi,philadelphia,Colorado, health insurance co-ops, OB, obamacare, , MedCity News", "article": {"section": "Daily", "tag": "obamacare", "published_time": "2015-11-30T10:01:33-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-06T11:49:36-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,width=device-width,user-scalable=no,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "But these new customers had high health costs, so the health insurance co-ops had to start paying a lot of bills.\nThousands of Americans are again searching for health insurance after losing it for 2016.\nAbout 80,000 people are in the same boat as the Heitmans, on the hunt for new insurance plans on Colorado\u2019s exchange.\nLinda Gorman, with the Independence Institute, a conservative-leaning Colorado think tank, says the new co-ops were in over their heads.\nThis story is part of a reporting partnership with NPR, Colorado Public Radio, WNPR and Kaiser Health News."}
