Now Carr will have to do it all again: he faces the best possible Democrat\u2013i.e. the worst possible opponent\u2013in State Sen. Ted Lieu, who finished second with 19% and is favored to win the general.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nBoth men are experienced public servants: Carr as a gang prosecutor in Los Angeles, Lieu as a legislator in Sacramento. Both men are also veterans: Carr in the Army, Lieu in the Air Force. Both men ran as moderates, with Carr downplaying hot-button issues like Obamacare and immigration, and Lieu focusing on transportation and the National Security Agency. Both men campaigned well and stood out, even in a very crowded field.\n\nThe district is very fortunate to have a choice between candidates of such high caliber. Each would be an asset to his party, to the district, and to the country as a whole.\n\nThe numbers, however, favor Lieu\u2013heavily.\n\nBased on the party registration figures alone, Carr starts at a 17-point disadvantage. Unless Carr wins every independent voter\u2013an impossible task\u2013he will have to peel off more than a few Democrats to defeat Lieu in November.\n\nThat would be easier to do if there were something obviously wrong with Lieu\u2013if he had been caught up directly in the numerous corruption scandals rocking Democrats in the State Senate, for example, or if he had expressed hostility to Israel, which would have alienated supporters in one of the most pro-Israel districts in the country.\n\nYet Lieu\u2019s record, while vulnerable in places, has yet to show any serious and exploitable political deficiencies. In fact, Lieu has taken a few brave stances lately\u2013positions that alienated the left, but which were arguably the right thing to do.\n\nCase in point: Lieu joined other Asian-American legislators in opposing an effort to overturn Proposition 209, the 1996 referendum that banned the use of race in college admissions and public contracts. He\u2019s still reliably liberal, but he\u2019s earned the ire of irascible lefty local editorial writers\u2013a point in his favor.\n\nLieu also deserves credit for the way he campaigned, a style that evoked the old \u201cTortoise and the Hare\u201d fable: slow and steady wins the race (or qualifies for the runoff, in this case). Never flashy, always composed, he was unfazed by the large field and by the riskier tactics employed by some of his opponents to gain attention. He found a unique, newsworthy message that appealed across the wide spectrum\u2013stop the NSA!\u2013and stuck to it.\n\nThe biggest surprise in the 33rd was that independent Marianne Williamson, the spiritual adviser and author whose early candidacy arguably convinced Waxman to retire, finished a distant fourth, with about 13%. She raised the most money, enjoyed the backing of several Hollywood A-listers, and had an army of hundreds of enthusiastic activists. Her yard signs were ubiquitous across the district, and she seemed poised for an upset.\n\nYet as they say in Chicago: \u201cYard signs don\u2019t vote.\u201d\n\nWilliamson made two mistakes, in retrospect: she declined to advertise on television, and she did not invest in polling. It is not good enough to generate \u201cearned media\u201d and general enthusiasm: a campaign has to know how to reach its own voters in particular, and bring them to the polls. With precious little new data on her own potential supporters, Williamson was running in the dark.\n\nNot so with Carr, who knew exactly where his voters were: watching the Fox News Channel.\n\nHe was not only the first candidate to run television ads, but he also ran them where it counted. Even though cable news in general is on a downward slide, those who watch it are more likely to vote in low-turnout primary elections. Though few voters in general knew anything about Carr, Republican voters in the 33rd district knew that he was their man.\n\nNothing can take away from Carr\u2019s achievement in winning the primary. Democrats may try to minimize Carr\u2019s success by pointing out that their party was split ten ways, and that the top three Democrat finishers more than doubled his winning vote total.\n\nThat is all true\u2013and, as predicted, none of the Democrats managed to top 20%. Yet Carr was one of three Republicans in the race. Only he prevailed\u2013and he did so through hard work and skill.\n\nHe\u2019ll need more than that, however, to solve the Ted Lieu puzzle.\n\nA Republican consultant, weighing the numbers, might advise Carr that since he has very little chance of winning, he may as well run the most dignified campaign he can, drawing attention to a few key issues, building his political profile for the future.\n\nYet that\u2019s not in Carr\u2019s nature. He\u2019s a fighter. Talk to him for even just a few minutes, and you realize that he\u2019s in it to win it.\n\nSo Carr\u2019s task is to find some weakness in Lieu\u2019s candidacy. His campaign seems convinced that the economy is the key. But it\u2019s not clear voters will blame Lieu personally for the state\u2019s broader woes.\n\nOne possible option: focus on term limits, which pushed Lieu out of Sacramento but which do not exist in D.C. The prospect of another 40-year incumbent could unite Lieu\u2019s opponents, left and right, behind Carr.\n\nThat, and incredible luck.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Blue State Blues: How Does Elan Carr Solve Ted Lieu?", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Blue State Blues: How Does Elan Carr Solve Ted Lieu?", "title": "Blue State Blues: How Does Elan Carr Solve Ted Lieu? - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Government/2014/Blue-State-Blues.jpeg", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2014/06/06/blue-state-blues-how-does-elan-carr-solve-ted-lieu/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Blue State Blues: How Does Elan Carr Solve Ted Lieu?", "creator": "@joelpollak", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Government/2014/Blue-State-Blues.jpeg", "title": "Blue State Blues: How Does Elan Carr Solve Ted Lieu? - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Henry Waxman, Independent, Senate,Big Government,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2014-06-06T05:36:00-07:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/joelpollak", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "Senate", "categories": "Big Government"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "the worst possible opponent\u2013in State Sen.
