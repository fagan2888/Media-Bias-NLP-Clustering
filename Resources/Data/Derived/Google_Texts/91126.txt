Bay County schools will soon kick off the new school year.

Before kids go back, however, some organizations gave families a chance to plan for their child's future.

Saturday afternoon, the Panama City Mall held its Tax Free Extravaganza.

Representatives from Bay, Central and Tyndall Federal credit unions offered banking advice to families. They showed them how to opening savings and checking accounts, and plan ahead to save for their child's college education.

"We learned about banking and how to open savings accounts," Mowat Middle School student Alidiea Odom said. "I think it's useful. It's going to be useful in the future because we're going to have to know what to do in the future. So they helped us."

Ty the Tyndall Turtle and Chick-Fil-A's cow made special appearances at the event Saturday.

The tax free holiday wraps up Sunday, August 16th.
