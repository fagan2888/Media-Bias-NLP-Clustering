He first came to the city in 1990 at the peak of the AIDS epidemic.\n\n\u201cAt that point, one out of every two patients we admitted was a young man dying of AIDS,\u201d he says.\n\nToday, that same ward is filled with diabetes patients.\n\n\u201cI feel like we are with diabetes where we were in 1990 with the AIDS epidemic,\u201d Schillinger said. \u201cThe ward is overwhelmed with diabetes \u2014 they\u2019re getting their limbs amputated, they\u2019re on dialysis. And these are young people. They are suffering the ravages of diabetes in the prime of their lives. We\u2019re at the point where we need a public health response to it.\u201d\n\nSchillinger and other researchers at the University of California at San Francisco are setting up a project called Sugar Science, to spell out the health dangers of too much added sugar in our diets.\n\nThere\u2019s a reason the word \u201cscience\u201d is part of the project\u2019s name.\n\nThe UCSF team distilled 8,000 studies and research papers and found strong evidence that the consumption of too much added sugar overloads vital organs and contributes not just to Type 2 diabetes but also to heart disease and liver disease.\n\nLaura Schmidt, a professor of health policy at UCSF\u2019s medical school, is also part of the Sugar Science team.\n\n\u201cRight now, the reality is that our consumption of sugar is out of whack,\u201d she says. \u201cThe only major change in the diet that explains the obesity epidemic is this steep rise in added sugar consumption that started in the 1980s,\u201d she says.\n\nThat sugar isn\u2019t just making us fat, she says, \u201cit\u2019s making us sick.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "article_summary": "\u201cThe only major change in the diet that explains the obesity epidemic is this steep rise in added sugar consumption that started in the 1980s,\u201d she says.\nLaura Schmidt, a professor of health policy at UCSF\u2019s medical school, is also part of the Sugar Science team.\nWe\u2019re at the point where we need a public health response to it.\u201dSchillinger and other researchers at the University of California at San Francisco are setting up a project called Sugar Science, to spell out the health dangers of too much added sugar in our diets.\n\u201cThe ward is overwhelmed with diabetes \u2014 they\u2019re getting their limbs amputated, they\u2019re on dialysis.\n\u201cRight now, the reality is that our consumption of sugar is out of whack,\u201d she says."}
