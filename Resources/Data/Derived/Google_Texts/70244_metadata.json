Place a bag in a bucket big enough to hold the turkey after it\u2019s been rinsed off. Place the turkey in the bag and pour the cooled brine over the turkey. Leave it in the refrigerator for 24 hours.\n\nAfter rinsing the turkey off, Mr. Boehner says for the first half of the cook time, he cooks the turkey breast down. Then he flips it over and lets it cook the rest of the time breast up.\n\n\u201cI only cook my bird to about 160 [degrees] \u2014 max,\u201d he says. \u201cThen I take it out, I pul foil over it and let it sit for at least an hour.
