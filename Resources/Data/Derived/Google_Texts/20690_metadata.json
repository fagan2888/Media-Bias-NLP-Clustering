Under a headline phrased as a command\u2014\u201cFellow Republicans: Talk about evolution\u201d\u2014he notes that his \u201cparty\u2019s last two presidential nominees, John McCain and Mitt Romney, both indicated that they accept the strong scientific consensus that the human species is the product of evolution.\u201d Republican Ponnuru points out that it appears \u201cthat for at least some Americans,\u201d acceptance of evolution \u201cis a marker of a candidate\u2019s acceptance of science and modernity, and rejection of it marks a candidate as anti-intellectual or just plain dumb.\u201d\n\nSo do the prospective Republican candidates all really reject it? Salon has offered what it calls \u201cEvolution and the GOP\u2019s 2016 candidates: A complete guide.\u201d The guide specifies four categories: \u201cThose who unequivocally accept the science; one candidate who accepts it, but with caveats; those who won\u2019t make clear where they stand; and finally, contenders who are evolution denialists.\u201d\n\nFor the first category, \u201cEvolutionists,\u201d Salon\u2019s entire text contains only one word: \u201cNobody.\u201d In the second, former Florida governor Jeb Bush stands as the single candidate who accepts evolution in a qualified way. Possible candidates labeled as ambiguous\u2014category 3\u2014are New Jersey governor Chris Christie, Texas senatorTed Cruz, Louisiana governor Bobby Jindal, Ohio governor John Kasich, Kentucky senator Rand Paul, Florida senator Marco Rubio, and Walker. In category 4\u2014outright evolution deniers\u2014Salon lists neurosurgeon Ben Carson, former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee, Texas governor Rick Perry, and former Pennsylvania senator Rick Santorum.\n\nBush\u2019s uniqueness in that breakdown suggests another question: Any chance that as the sole inhabitant of category 2, he\u2019ll move to category 1? After all, the Palm Beach Post reported back in December 2012 that Bush \u201csaid yes when asked if evolution should be taught in schools\u201d and that he added, \u201cI reject the premise that the GOP is anti-science.\u201d He\u2019s known for a willingness to change his outlook, according to the front-page 11 January New York Times article \u201cFor Jeb Bush, evolving views over 2 decades.\u201d The Times quoted a \u201clongtime friend,\u201d Al Cardenas: \u201cThere is an evolution in temperament and an evolution in judgment and an evolution in wisdom\u2014and there is an evolution in his respect for others\u2019 point of view.\u201d The article never mentioned evolution in the science sense, but it ended by recalling Bush\u2019s caution to the 2012 Republican candidates that they must broaden their appeal.\n\nOn the other hand, consider the political disincentive for science forthrightness. Earlier this month, the Pew Research Center reported that \u201conly a minority of Americans fully accept evolution through natural selection.\u201d A year ago, a Pew posting began, \u201cSignificantly fewer Republicans believe in evolution than did so four years ago.\u201d\n\nAt Talking Points Memo, which calls itself America\u2019s \u201cpremier digital native political news organization,\u201d last September\u2019s posting \u201cBobby Jindal refuses to say if he believes in evolution\u201d ended by illustrating the disincentive\u2019s strength:\n\nThe reporter interrupted Jindal, a Rhodes scholar who studied biology and public policy at Brown University, to press him on the original question of whether he believes the theory of evolution reflects the best scientific thinking about life on Earth. \u201cI will tell you, as a father, I want my kids to be taught about evolution in their schools, but secondly, I think local school districts should make the decision,\u201d he said. Pressed a third time on what he personally thinks, Jindal again sidestepped. \u201cI told you what I think. I think that local school districts, not the federal government, should make the decision about how they teach science, biology, economics. I want my kids to be taught about evolution; I want my kids to be taught about other theories.\u201d At the same event, Jindal called the Obama administration \u201cscience deniers\u201d upon rolling out a national energy policy blueprint.\n\nThat final paragraph\u2019s droll sarcasm illustrates an outlook widespread in the media and elsewhere. It calls to mind another question: How should journalists, politicians, scientists, and citizens respond to National Review\u2019s Jonah Goldberg, who recently posted the commentary \u201cMedia\u2019s interrogation of Scott Walker on evolution is in bad faith\u201d? Goldberg\u2019s subhead asserted, \u201cIt\u2019s not about science. It\u2019s about the culture war.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, the Wall Street Journal\u2019s James Taranto recently condemned the Walker incident as media \u201chazing\u201d via \u201csilly\u201d questions. Taranto charged, \u201cDeclarations like \u2018I believe in evolution\u2019 or \u2018evolution is fact\u2019 are not serious thoughts but badges of identity.\u201d\n\nAlong those lines, a Washington Times opinion piece conveyed outright bitterness. It began, \u201cIt is such a high, blessed relief to finally get to the bottom of the most pressing issue here in this age of $17 trillion U.S. debt, barbaric animals burning humans alive in cages, the systematic rounding up, rape and mutilation of young girls around the world and all these inconvenient blizzards and bone-chilling winds blowing giant holes in our faith in the newly founded Church of Global Warming.\u201d Soon it identified the \u201cpressing issue\u201d:\n\nThe great revelation that we should all be so grateful that the national media got to the bottom of this week is: What on earth does Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker think about evolution? Like all of you, I have been wondering this for years. Because, really, in these pressing times, what could be more important to know about a guy than what he thinks about evolution?\n\nGoldberg\u2019s more serious piece appeared widely across the country. He asserts that \u201cthe evolution question really isn\u2019t about evolution at all.\u201d He continues:\n\nOn the surface, it\u2019s about the culture war. To borrow a phrase from the campus left, Darwinism is used to \u201cotherize\u201d certain people of traditional faith\u2014and the politicians who want their vote. Many of the same people who bleat with fear over the dangers of genetically modified food, fracking, vaccines, or nuclear power and coo with childlike awe over the benefits of non-traditional medicines will nonetheless tell you they are for \u201cscience\u201d when in fact they are simply against a certain kind of Christian having any say about anything. As my National Review colleague Kevin Williamson notes, \u201cEverybody wants to know what Scott Walker and Sarah Palin think about evolution, but almost nobody is asking what Nancy Pelosi and Barack Obama think about homeopathy, acupuncture, aromatherapy and the like.\u201d Even though such remedies have been given elevated legitimacy under the Affordable Care Act. Presidents have become avatars in the culture war being fought across the Internet and the airwaves, and nothing gives secular liberal journalists more of a buzz than exposing the alleged backwardness of those they consider backward. It\u2019s a cultural wedge issue used by the very people who claim they hate cultural wedge issues.\n\nGoldberg never acknowledges what Republican Ponnuru emphasizes: that whether or not a secular liberal bias animates journalists, acceptance of evolution is seen by many as \u201ca marker of a candidate\u2019s acceptance of science and modernity, and rejection of it marks a candidate as anti-intellectual or just plain dumb.\u201d He never acknowledges the centrality of evolution theory in biology, or the expectation that candidates for the US presidency will routinely exhibit basic science awareness.\n\nIn what\u2019s intended only as a jab at liberals but comes out as something more, Bruni does point out that religious talk can \u201cput a rosy glow on political calculations.\u201d He observes that President Obama \u201cframed his past opposition to gay marriage as a deeply personal matter of faith. But as David Axelrod\u2019s new book, Believer, makes clear, it was a deeply expedient matter of evading some voters\u2019 wrath. He more or less supported gay marriage, at least when he was away from the podium, all along.\u201d\n\nBut doesn\u2019t that \u201cyeah, but\u201d observation\u2014\u201cYeah, but liberals do something similar\u201d\u2014imply that what Salon cataloged is really just gradations of a calculated evasion, at least for the prospective candidates who aren\u2019t outright evolution deniers? Aren\u2019t most of them likely making a political trade-off, seeking to gain more advantage from the appearance of a certain kind of religiosity than they believe can be gained from forthright affirmation of this plainly settled science?\n\nGoldberg seems implicitly to make that admission again in his ending. There he imagines his own answer to a reporter\u2019s insistent evolution question. He says it \u201cwould be something like: \u2018Not that it much matters for the job I\u2019m seeking, but I think the evidence shows that all life evolves. Why is there life, and what are we supposed to do with it? Only God knows.\u2019\u201d\n\n---\n\nSteven T.
