The cause is unknown, but those families affected say they believe it was poison.\n\n\"We came in Wednesday night and there was no dogs there,\" Sherry Munn, who had one dog die from possible being poisoned said. \"My husband had a doctors appointment, there was no dogs around. I said isn't that strange, we don't have any dogs, where are they. Well, come to find out we got to checking and on Facebook, the neighbors dogs, they said we found our dog dead. Another one called and said we found our dog dead.\"\n\nAt last check four dogs were found dead, 3 were recovering after being taken to a vet, and 1 is still missing.\n\n\"Our dog Zeke was a 2 1/2 year old Brindle Boxer and he belonged to my daughter Stella here,\" Jenny Collison said. \"He was a member of our family and he just loved our kids, loved all the kids in the neighborhood.\"\n\nOwners say they believe someone is poisoning their dogs because of the state they found them in.\n\n\"They all died in a short amount of time the very same night,\" said Collison. \"It just seemed like too much of a coincidence to be just a random act. To me, it's just too many at one time.\"\n\nUntil answers are found, the community is sticking together and hope no more dogs become a victim to whatever it is killing them off.\n\n\"I can't think of a word to describe a person that would be so evil,\" stated Munn. \"These are God's creatures, those little dogs they matter.\"\n\n\"Just the thought of somebody that viscous could possibly live close to here, is just very unsettling,\" said Collison.\n\nIf you have any information about any of the poisonings, you can call The Newton County Sheriff's Department at 601-635-2101.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "For some residents of Newton County, they say their dogs are being poisoned", "language": "english", "author": "Aaron Morrison", "og": {"description": "For some residents of Newton County, they say their dogs are being poisoned", "title": "Newton County Residents Say Dogs are being Poisoned", "url": "http://www.wtok.com/home/headlines/Newton-County-Residents-Say-Dogs-are-being-Poisoned-349102251.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/217/DD5/217DD5F7ED584BB69C3A187DEE83A2F8", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/5C2/F1F/5C2F1F904F2648F9B943B348912BB8ED.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.wtok.com", "description": "For some residents of Newton County, they say their dogs are being poisoned", "title": "Newton County Residents Say Dogs are being Poisoned", "url": "http://www.wtok.com/home/headlines/Newton-County-Residents-Say-Dogs-are-being-Poisoned-349102251.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/Zeke+1.jpg", "creator": "@newscenter11", "site": "@newscenter11", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Newton County Residents Say Dogs are being Poisoned", "google-site-verification": "M1YwZ85zoJ2ZNboZjzjADGJ9L53qqzbNOi6FLrtDw9U", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Newton County Residents Say Dogs"}, "article_summary": "If you have any information about any of the poisonings, you can call The Newton County Sheriff's Department at 601-635-2101.\n\"He was a member of our family and he just loved our kids, loved all the kids in the neighborhood.\"\nAnswers are being sought in a neighborhood in Newton County, after several dogs were discovered dead.\nWell, come to find out we got to checking and on Facebook, the neighbors dogs, they said we found our dog dead.\n\"We came in Wednesday night and there was no dogs there,\" Sherry Munn, who had one dog die from possible being poisoned said."}
