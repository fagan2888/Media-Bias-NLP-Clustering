That should further propel domestic demand and push up tax revenue, enabling the government to increase state spending.\n\n\"Thanks to its strong economic position, I'm confident that Germany will master the challenges of accommodating and integrating the refugees,\" Gabriel said.\n\nLooking ahead, Gabriel urged more investment in education. \"Schools in difficult neighborhoods, where a lot of young people are dropping out, have to become the lighthouses, the cathedrals in our country,\" said Gabriel, who is also leader of Chancellor Angela Merkel's junior partner, the Social Democrats.\n\nThe German government has run a balanced budget since 2014 and the state, including social funds, is heading for an overall surplus of some 11 billion euros ($12.4 billion) this year.\n\nThe coalition has agreed to stick to its goal of a balanced budget until 2020. Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble has said Germany must lead by example when it comes to budget discipline.\n\nGermany's budget rules, the co-called Schuldenbremse, would theoretically allow Berlin to take in net new debt of around 0.35 percent of GDP, which would equal up to ten billion euros.\n\n(Additional reporting by Joseph Nasr,; Editing by Paul Carrel/Larry King)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "BERLIN (Reuters) - The German government on Wednesday stuck to its economic growth for", "title": "Germany confirms growth forecast despite weaker exports", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/20/Germany-confirms-growth-forecast-despite-weaker-export-prospects", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/germany-politics_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/20/Germany-confirms-growth-forecast-despite-weaker-export-prospects", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/germany-politics_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "BERLIN (Reuters) - The German government on Wednesday stuck to its economic growth for", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\"Germany's economic upswing will continue this year and next,\" Economy Minister Sigmar Gabriel told a news conference to present updated German growth forecasts.\n\"Thanks to its strong economic position, I'm confident that Germany will master the challenges of accommodating and integrating the refugees,\" Gabriel said.\nWEAKER PROSPECTSThe government predicts economic growth to slow to 1.5 percent in 2017, partly because of extraneous effects such as more public holidays falling on normal week days, Gabriel said.\nBERLIN (Reuters) - The German government on Wednesday stuck to its economic growth forecast of 1.7 percent for this year, despite a slowdown in emerging markets, as strong domestic demand is replacing exports as the main pillar of Europe's largest economy.\nFinance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble has said Germany must lead by example when it comes to budget discipline."}
