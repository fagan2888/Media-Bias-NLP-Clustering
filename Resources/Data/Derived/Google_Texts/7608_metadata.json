And I am deeply upset that these statements come from a so-called feminist icon.\n\nI am with Bernie because I can trust him to stand firm in his beliefs, because I know he can\u2019t be bought, because I believe that every man, woman and child deserves the opportunity to pursue their education and claim their piece of the American Dream.\n\nI\u2019m with Bernie because I don\u2019t believe in making America the world\u2019s policeman, because I am appalled by the growing economic disparity in our country, because he represents a Washington that operates by the people and for the people. I\u2019m with Bernie because he stands for change, for democracy, for equality and for hope. Julia Clarke\n\nWhy I'm pulling for Trump\n\nMedford, L.I.: Donald Trump has advocated for a wall on our southern border that will shut down the flow of illegal aliens, terrorists and drugs into our country. He will bring jobs back from foreign countries, fulfilling his promise of being \u201cthe greatest jobs President that God ever created.\u201d He has said he will make the U.S. not only energy-independent, but the energy capital of the world. He has said that he will repeal Obamacare and Common Core on the first day of his administration. He is the toughest candidate on terror and would rebuild our military and properly take care of our veterans.\n\nExactly what would be so terrible about the prospect of a Trump presidency?\n\nEugene R. Dunn\n\nWomen wronged\n\nBlue Mound, Ill.: Re Gloria Steinem on Bill Maher: The bigger issue is that twice she refused to answer Maher\u2019s question regarding the ill-treatment of women in Muslim countries. She just kept saying that anyplace where there is monotheism is a bad place for women\u2019s rights \u2014 as if U.S. women are just as oppressed. Jim Andrews\n\nNo complaints\n\nManhattan: Linda Stasi\u2019s Sunday column was spot-on (\u201cCarly, Hil\u2019s fine whine,\u201d Feb.7). As a single workingwoman, I know all too well how difficult it is and was to claw my way up the corporate ladder without assistance or mentoring, and doing it without whining, such as our politicians have done and continue to do. Bravo. Lisa Levy\n\nGravity gets Newton\n\nManhattan: To Cam Newton: What, no Superman poses? Damian Begley\n\nNot even halfway there\n\nBrooklyn: The Super Bowl halftime show sucked. Between what\u2019s-her-name and that mutt dressed in black and gold, they really made me change the channel fast. Bring back Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers. That was the best halftime show ever. And to Peyton Manning, way to go! Jeffrey P. Smith\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 beats \u2019em all\n\nSingapore: Beyonc\u00e9 is not only an amazing performer but has grace and athleticism. She nailed the 50th Super Bowl halftime show! Fast on her feet and didn\u2019t miss a beat. Thanks again to all of the artists for a great performance. Mary Anne Coleman\n\nEmergency response needed\n\nStaten Island: With all the controversy surrounding the City Council and its 32% raise, versus the minute raise given police, there has never been a mention of the most underpaid first responders of all: the EMS. Though a wing of the Fire Department, they are underpaid to the point that without substantial overtime or working a second job, supporting their families is a hardship. Even sanitation workers (and yes, they deserve it) make many thousands more. EMTs and paramedics literally hold the lives of people in their hands and should have pay parity with their brethren in the NYPD and FDNY. Joe Belvedere\n\nCouncil raises hell\n\nWantagh, L.I.: I am appalled at the ignorance of fuming Voicers complaining about the City Council\u2019s raise. Are they not aware that these Council members have not had a raise since 2006? I don\u2019t know why there isn\u2019t more sympathy for these part-timers struggling to make it on their $112,500. So, I have a perfect solution. Instead of letting these politicians suffer without any pay increases for 10 years, why not insist that they, too, receive the same magnificent 1% pay raise afforded our NYPD? If it is enough for uniformed personnel, it has to be just fine for the useless City Council. Joanne Urban\n\nRun out of town\n\nFloral Park: The only reason \u201cunderpaid\u201d City Council members ran for the job was because it paid more money than they could make elsewhere. Now our esteemed mayor is planning to build a streetcar service for $2.5 billion since he can\u2019t figure out any better use for that amount of money. I suggest we gather up all the Central Park horses, attach them to a huge wagon containing the mayor and City Council members, and haul them away forever. Just send the horses back; we love them. Irv Leshkowitz\n\nLet a thousand flowers bloom\n\nDouglaston: I totally agree with Voicer Thomas Hughes (no relation that I know of) about having horse-drawn streetcars and using their manure to grow lovely flowers in the park. The manure can be picked up by politicians, who seem to know how to handle it .Irene Hughes\n\nHauling bags of money\n\nManhattan: Re \u201cCall him Mayor Clean\u201d (editorial, Feb. 7): I\u2019m surprised that the Daily News gave unequivocal approval to the mayor\u2019s plan for increased garbage collection without at least some mention of the plan\u2019s cost-effectiveness. A sanitation worker called in on a Sunday earns double time, which is a fast way to fatten a city pension. Like firefighters and police officers, sanitation workers need to be scheduled over a seven-day workweek at their regular rate of pay. It\u2019s time to change antiquated work rules. David Moretti\n\nDiagnosing de Blasio\n\nWauwatosa, Wis.: Mayor de Blasio is beating the same dead horse, still. What\u2019s wrong with this man? What in the heck does NYCLASS have on him, anyway? It\u2019s got to be more than a few measly millions, to explain why he would make this so personal, throwing one childish temper tantrum after another. The whole world keeps clobbering him. Maybe it\u2019s brain damage by now? He reminds me of Monty Python\u2019s Black Knight, with blood and limbs littering the ground: \u201cIt\u2019s just a flesh wound!\u201d Charlotte Allmann\n\nSchools for scandal\n\nHackensack, N.J.: I was shocked, but not surprised at the scandal of the educational process in many ultra-Orthodox and Hasidic yeshivas (\u201cThousands of ill-educated boys,\u201d Op-Ed, Feb. 7). These communities are extremely well-connected politically. The scandal is not that they practice their exclusionary faith, but that they fall so far short in providing the basic education that is required by law. After the taxpayers help provide these \u201cschools\u201d with millions of dollars for Torah studies, they are taxed again when they have to provide social services to these uneducated boys who have not been prepared to succeed in our society. Let\u2019s see how that would work if another religious or ethnic group provided a phony, state-sanctioned curriculum. What will happen here? Nothing. Richard A. Naumann\n\nUn-American invasion\n\nRidgewood, N.J.: Re \u201cKicked out for nothing\u201d (Feb. 7): The NYPD locking people out of their homes is tyranny \u2014 cruel and excessive, the work of a Stalinist. This \u201claw\u201d should be erased and purged, immediately. Peter J. Peirano\n\nGrinches at large\n\nBrooklyn: I live in Sunset Park. During the Christmas season, a family in my area decorated their home, putting a lot of work and Christmas spirit into this display. They even had Santa standing outside taking photos with neighborhood children. Shortly after Christmas, some creeps wrecked the display. Why would they do this? The family is very upset and may not decorate again. The expense of what was wrecked is overwhelming, including to their spirits. Please, someone must know something about this crime. Sheila K. Pisciotta\n\nDeadly greed\n\nManhattan: I am appalled by the behavior of that apology for a human, Martin Shkreli, who jacked up the price of a lifesaving drug from $13.50 to $750 a pill. I wonder how many people died as a consequence of his greed. I hope this narcissistic jerk is sent to jail for a very long time.
