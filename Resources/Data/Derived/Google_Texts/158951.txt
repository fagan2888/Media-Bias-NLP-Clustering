"Today is #WorldMentalHealthDay. Mental illness is often misunderstood & misrepresented, but that's starting to change," she tweeted on Friday, Oct. 10. "Let's end the stigma. Mental health IS as important as physical health, & whether there are visible signs or not, the suffering is real. It can affect EVERYONE."

The 23-year-old is tired of the public remaining uneducated on the topics of depression and mental illness.

"So please, let's help stop the misconceptions & support those who need our help," she continued. "Healing the whole starts with healing minds. No matter what the misinformed say, you can't simply CHOOSE to make mental illness go away. It is NOT cowardly to suffer or seek help."

To end her discussion, Williams opened up about her father's own journey.
