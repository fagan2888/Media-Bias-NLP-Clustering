But they rarely drive private equity, a business that\u2019s reshaped economic life for millions.\n\nWhich is why what\u2019s happening at TSG Consumer Partners, a private equity firm with about $3 billion in assets under management, might seem so surprising.\n\nTSG, established in 1987, has made its name by successfully investing in consumer brands, an area in which women \u2014 who control 80 percent of household purchases \u2014 are the ultimate deciders.\n\nNow TSG is pushing into fashion, another business whose customers are overwhelming female \u2014 and depending on several women dealmakers to help navigate the notoriously fickle industry.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very different to have a personal experience with a brand or a category,\u201d said Jennifer Baxter Moser, a TSG managing director. \u201cWe\u2019ve been walking the store floors and living in these categories for a long time.\u201d\n\nTSG is hardly setting out to fix the gender inequality problem in the 40-year-old private equity industry. At the 10 biggest firms, only about 11 percent of senior managers are women. At TSG, that figure is almost 40 percent.\n\nBut Moser and Paula Sutter, chief executive of TSG Fashion, say they\u2019re well positioned to spot potentially lucrative investments in apparel and consumer goods. That\u2019s a tall order: These industries are littered with might-have-beens and used-to-bes, from American Apparel Inc. to Abercrombie & Fitch Co.\n\nYet in some ways Moser and Sutter are simply heeding the advice of Warren Buffett: Invest in what you know. Moser, for instance, liked shopping at Revolve Clothing, an e-tailer offering LA-chic fashion. So much so that she persuaded Revolve to sell a piece of itself to TSG.\n\nMany investment firms try out products and services before putting their money down. But when Revolve founders Michael Mente and Mike Karanikolas checked customer records, they discovered Moser was a regular customer.\n\n\u201cIt makes a difference \u2014 it gives them an insight others don\u2019t have,\u201d said Karanikolas, 37. \u201cThey\u2019re very close to the brands they represent.\u201d\n\nTSG began thinking about getting into apparel in 2007 but held off as the recession bit into consumers\u2019 wallets. Moser said the firm needed time to review businesses and develop standards to measure their investment potential.\n\nIn addition to Revolve, TSG has taken stakes in Paige Denim and Alexis Bittar, a jewelry maker.\n\nThe firm has done pretty well so far. After investing in Smashbox Cosmetics, it helped add new products and improve marketing. Sales tripled, and TSG sold its stake to Estee Lauder Cos. for an undisclosed price. TSG did similar work after a 2003 investment in Glaceau Vitaminwater.\n\nTSG\u2019s most recent fund, which finished gathering $1.3 billion in 2011 to make investments, was producing a 43 percent annualized return after fees as of March 31, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That compares with a 19 percent annualized return, with dividends reinvested, in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index of large U.S. stocks during that time.\n\n\u201cAs a private equity firm, having women involved makes a lot of sense \u2014 they\u2019re going to bring a different perspective,\u201d said Randy Allen, senior lecturer of management at the Samuel Curtis Johnson Graduate School of Management at Cornell University. \u201cThey\u2019re going do have a different view of analyzing a company for its potential.\u201d\n\nAt Revolve, the two founders have retained control and worked with Sutter to expand internationally, strengthen management and build out the private-label business. TSG has also helped Revolve think about what a sale or initial stock offering might mean for the company.\n\nRevolve is now growing at 50 percent over last year \u2014 and TSG is still early into its typical five- to seven-year investment timeline.\n\nAs Revolve looks for its breakout moment, Moser and Sutter at TSG may help keep the company focused on sustainable growth, Cornell\u2019s Allen said.\n\n\u201cWomen bring a different dimension to thinking about those issues,\u201d Allen said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re trying to build a fashion brand or a retail company, you need to make sure you have the foundation right before you grow the business rapidly.\u201d\n\nLindsey Rupp,\n\nBloomberg News", "article_metadata": {"description": "TSG is pushing into fashion and depending on women dealmakers to help navigate the industry.", "og": {"description": "TSG is pushing into fashion and depending on women dealmakers to help navigate the industry.", "title": "Deal-making women push into the fickle world of fashion", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20150822-deal-making-women-push-into-the-fickle-world-of-fashion.ece", "image": {"width": 1280, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20150822-equity1.ece/BINARY/original/equity1", "height": 1280}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2015-08-23T00:42:44Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2015-08-22T22:42:55Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Deal-making women push into the fickle world of fashion\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20150822-deal-making-women-push-into-the-fickle-world-of-fashion.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20150822-equity1.ece/BINARY/original/equity1\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"2405579\", \"pub_date\": \"2015-08-22T22:42:55Z\", \"section\": \"Economy & You Headlines\", \"author\": \"\", \"tags\": [\"dallas\", \"dallas fort worth\", \"dallas news\", \"dallas fort worth news\", \"dfw news\", \"dallas local news\", \"dallas fort worth local news\", \"dallas newspaper\", \"dallas morning news\", \"dallas morning news newspaper\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 1043783589, "page_id": 20946638799, "app_id": 258290334265148}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"image": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20150822-equity1.ece/ALTERNATES/w660/equity1", "publishtime": "2015-08-22T22:42:55Z"}}, "news_keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper"}, "article_summary": "In addition to Revolve, TSG has taken stakes in Paige Denim and Alexis Bittar, a jewelry maker.\nNow TSG is pushing into fashion, another business whose customers are overwhelming female \u2014 and depending on several women dealmakers to help navigate the notoriously fickle industry.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very different to have a personal experience with a brand or a category,\u201d said Jennifer Baxter Moser, a TSG managing director.\nBut Moser and Paula Sutter, chief executive of TSG Fashion, say they\u2019re well positioned to spot potentially lucrative investments in apparel and consumer goods.\nYet in some ways Moser and Sutter are simply heeding the advice of Warren Buffett: Invest in what you know."}
