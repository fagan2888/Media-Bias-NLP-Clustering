If the estimate holds, it would mark the lowest quarterly GDP growth since the first quarter of last year \u2026 when unseasonably cold weather was blamed (erroneously) for the dip.\n\nIf it slips even lower, we would be looking at the worst quarterly performance since a contraction in the first quarter of 2014.\n\nWhat\u2019s responsible for the decline?\n\n\u201cThe forecast for first-quarter real consumer spending growth fell from 2.5 percent to 1.8 percent,\u201d according to the bank.\n\nThere was also a big drop-off in net exports \u2013 which is another reason to oppose the crony capitalist trade deal being pushed by U.S. president Barack Obama and several \u201cRepublican\u201d leaders in Washington, D.C.\n\nMaking matters worse? There\u2019s a ton of inventory liquidation yet to occur. And the \u201cdriver\u201d of the anemic growth we are currently witnessing is \u2026 wait for it \u2026 new health care spending (a.k.a. new Obamacare taxes).\n\nYeah \u2026\n\nAgain, we don\u2019t want to be pessimists. We really don\u2019t. We\u2019d love to come to you with good numbers \u2026 the result of a government that understood its proper place in the free market.\n\nBut we don\u2019t have that government \u2026 we have the federal government of the United States of America, which remains committed to the perpetual incentivizing of dependency, status quo deficit spending, crony capitalism (a.k.a corporate welfare), invasive bureaucracy, reckless global interventionism, open borders and more secretive central bank \u201cstimuli.\u201d\n\nAs long as those policies remain in place, expect to see sustained sluggishness \u2026 perhaps even another recession.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.fitsnews.com/2016/03/28/q1-growth-estimate-implodes/", "site_name": "http://www.fitsnews.com", "image": "http://fitsnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/us-economy-555x370.jpeg", "type": "article", "title": "Q1 Growth Estimate Implodes"}, "google-site-verification": "qt01SY7jA5pURQJ_8ITASviDysHU8yHfJWpIIdAPKQU", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThe forecast for first-quarter real consumer spending growth fell from 2.5 percent to 1.8 percent,\u201d according to the bank.\nIf the estimate holds, it would mark the lowest quarterly GDP growth since the first quarter of last year \u2026 when unseasonably cold weather was blamed (erroneously) for the dip.\nFor those of you keeping score at home, that\u2019s less than one quarter the level of economic growth originally projected.\nAnd the \u201cdriver\u201d of the anemic growth we are currently witnessing is \u2026 wait for it \u2026 new health care spending (a.k.a.\nAfter watching first quarter gross domestic product (GDP) growth estimates slide from 2.7 percent all the way down to 1.4 percent last week, the latest estimate from the Atlanta Federal Reserve bank for the current quarter clocked in at an anemic 0.6 percent."}
