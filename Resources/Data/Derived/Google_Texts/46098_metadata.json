This of course means he and his kids must stay over at Willie\u2019s place. Si, Jep, and the Duck Commander employees continuously make \u201cgentlemen\u2019s bets\u201d of one dollar on increasingly ridiculous situations.\n\nHilarity Ensues: Jase staying at Willie\u2019s house leads to a classic sitcom trope of taking advantage of a family member\u2019s hospitality. The family member who\u2019s providing the hospitality then feels like they can\u2019t throw the other one out. Jase takes his backwoods boorishness to extremes, gutting fish in Willie\u2019s kitchen, bringing a dead beaver into the house, and filling the hot tub with live crawfish.\n\nMajor Themes: Brotherly love; offending the sensibilities of animal rights activists.\n\nIs This for Real? No. Most of this episode\u2019s scenes seem pretty set up. From Jase and Willie\u2019s sibling rivalry to Si\u2019s physical antics during the different sports-related bets, this is textbook situation comedy staging.\n\nThere\u2019s one scene that seems very real \u2013 a classic moment of Louisiana absurdity. The Duck Commander boys and Uncle Si have to help Phil get a crawfish skiff out of a tree after Hurricane Gustav. This is perfectly believable in the world of swamps and hurricanes. Strange things just seem to happen around here.\n\nOne element of the show I\u2019d like to know more about is the labeling of \u201cfavorites\u201d within the family. The brothers have made it clear they know the youngest brother, Jep, is their mother, Miss Kay\u2019s, favorite son. At one point during this episode, Korrie reminds Willie that Jase is his favorite brother. Is this acceptable in a large family? Is it simply understood that with so many people to love, someone will find themselves someone else\u2019s favorite?\n\nThe Christian Angle: In 2010\u2014pre-Duck Dynasty days\u2014Phil Robertson gave a sermon at the Berean Bible Church of Pottstown, PA. Interestingly, the event was a \u201cWild Game Supper\u201d and included a prize for best taxidermy. Phil came to the event in his best swamp man getup: camouflage from head to toe; none of the sunglasses and bandanas that Duck Dynasty has made trendy.\n\nIt\u2019s not surprising that in the course of the sermon, Phil places himself in the line of the Founding Fathers, Washington, Jefferson, Monroe, whom he says were all \u201cGodly men,\u201d and founded the United States on Biblical authority. He goes on to denounce abortion, homosexuality, big government, animal rights activists, and takes at least a sideways whack at Obamacare.\n\nHere\u2019s a link to the sermon. (You can hear all of it by clicking on the Berean Bible Church\u2019s Youube channel.)\n\nArticles and Web sites have made it clear that Phil sees his involvement in the show as a chance to spread the Gospel of Jesus Christ. An interesting point for further consideration is how Phil\u2019s preaching lines up with his character as portrayed on the show.\n\nI\u2019ll be posting more on Phil\u2019s preaching and what I think it means for the Duck Dynasty phenomenon at a later date.\n\nThe Wrap-Up: Duck Dynasty is on every Wednesday at 10PM Eastern, 9PM Central on A&E.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Pop Theology", "description": "Where religion meets pop culture.", "title": "Duck Dynasty Blog #4: \u201cA-Jase-ent Living\u201d", "url": "http://www.patheos.com/blogs/poptheology/2013/09/duck-dynasty-blog-4/", "image": "http://wp.production.patheos.com/blogs/poptheology/files/2013/09/duck-dynasty-zoom.jpg", "type": "article"}, "com.silverpop.brandeddomains": "www.pages04.net,patheos.mkt5005.com,www.patheos.com", "robots": "noodp,noydir"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccfc4\"", "article_summary": "I\u2019ll be posting more on Phil\u2019s preaching and what I think it means for the Duck Dynasty phenomenon at a later date.\nThe Wrap-Up: Duck Dynasty is on every Wednesday at 10PM Eastern, 9PM Central on A&E.\nPhil came to the event in his best swamp man getup: camouflage from head to toe; none of the sunglasses and bandanas that Duck Dynasty has made trendy.\nHilarity Ensues: Jase staying at Willie\u2019s house leads to a classic sitcom trope of taking advantage of a family member\u2019s hospitality.\nSi, Jep, and the Duck Commander employees continuously make \u201cgentlemen\u2019s bets\u201d of one dollar on increasingly ridiculous situations."}
