Johnson Presidential Library this week, President Obama touched on one of his favorite themes, the nature of social progress \u2014 or, as he likes to call it, history. \u201c[W]e are here today because we know we cannot be complacent,\u201d Obama said. \u201cFor history travels not only forwards; history can travel backwards, history can travel sideways. And securing the gains this country has made requires the vigilance of its citizens.\u201d I\u2019ve always considered Obama\u2019s skepticism of the conventional narrative of progress \u2014 that things are, as Paul McCartney once sang, getting better all the time \u2014 to be one of his most appealing intellectual traits, a testament to his ability to, at his best, reject both despair and blind optimism and to understand that justice is not a given and positive change is not guaranteed. Conservatives, of course, ridiculed the line; children of the ever-cheery Ronald Reagan that they are, ambiguity and nuance is not really their thing.\n\nIn that moment, Obama was speaking about political progress and social change. But the insight can be extended well beyond the realm of civil rights and electoral politics. Ask someone who was young in the late \u201970s, when punk rock supposedly forever vanquished disco, what they think of \u201cGet Lucky\u201d; or how about someone who thought they\u2019d survived the \u201cmom jeans\u201d trend in the 1990s only to see them dotting college campuses once again, less than 20 years later. Or, to pick an example considerably less sexy than Daft Punk and fashion, look at the recent moves of three of the political press\u2019 most influential writers: Ezra Klein, Nate Silver and Jonathan Chait.\n\nThese three men aren\u2019t rolling back civil rights or bringing back the Bee Gees, but they\u2019re doing something almost as bad: Whether they know it or not, they\u2019re bringing back what media critic and New York University professor Jay Rosen has famously called \u201cthe view from nowhere,\u201d an awful tic of American journalism that I believed, apparently in error, most smart and thoughtful reporters had abandoned after the blogosphere shook up the industry some 10-plus years ago.\n\nBefore detailing these three leading lights\u2019 recent sins, however, let\u2019s take a brief moment to describe the view from nowhere and explain why it\u2019s pernicious and undeserving of rehabilitation. Probably no one has devised a better definition of the phenomenon than Rosen, who describes it as \u201ca bid for trust that advertises the viewlessness of the news producer.\u201d According to Rosen, the view from nowhere \u201cplaces the journalist between polarized extremes, and calls that neither-nor position \u2018impartial.\u2019\u201d As Rosen himself will grant, this inclination to be \u201cobjective\u201d is not always bad. Indeed, journalism is impossible if its practitioners don\u2019t acknowledge the existence of at least some kind of baseline objective reality. But the view from nowhere is more often a self-flattering and ass-covering gimmick, one that is intended to protect the journalist from receiving criticism for partiality but often leaves the reader less informed as a result. Paul Krugman has a famous joke headline about the view from nowhere, one that\u2019s only a slight exaggeration of the practice at its worst: \u201cShape of the Planet: Both Sides Have a Point.\u201d\n\nWhen the blogosphere was at its most influential and least co-opted, around 10 years ago, an attack on the view from nowhere was one of its greatest and most disruptive critiques. As bloggers rightly pointed out, establishment journalists\u2019 claims to be able to discern the unbiased, objective reality of any political dispute \u2014 which invariably turned out to be the midway point between the two extremes \u2014 was patent nonsense. Like any other social group, elite journalists had their unconscious biases and unstated assumptions. Figures like former New York Times editor Bill Keller or former Associated Press Washington bureau chief Ron Fournier could tell themselves that their preference for reducing the deficit by cutting Social Security and raising taxes was untarnished by ideology \u2014 but that didn\u2019t make it so. Reporters at prestige outlets like the Washington Post or the Wall Street Journal could assume that because none of their friends or sources were globalization skeptics, no one took protectionist trade policy seriously. But the millions of Americans who voted for Ross Perot and Pat Buchanan in the 1990s would beg to differ.\n\nAnd while it inspired gnashing of teeth and rending of garments from elite journalists more comfortable with the old guard, the ascension of \u201cpartisan\u201d media like Fox News, the Huffington Post, \u201clean forward\u201d-era MSNBC and group blogs on the left (Daily Kos) and right (RedState) was ultimately a good thing. There were drawbacks to ideological news sources, sure; but even if the range of stories covered by a lefty blog was more circumscribed than what you might find at CNN.com, readers could have more of a sense of the biases undergirding any given news source\u2019s reporting and could apply grains of salt accordingly. They wouldn\u2019t have to wonder if a glowing profile of Noam Chomsky gave short shrift to his critics, because they could note the political orientation of the news provider, and get further information from its opposite, before forming their own opinion. It\u2019s not a perfect model, by any means, but it has one huge advantage over the previous standard: It\u2019s honest.\n\nFor a while now, this new, more realistic appreciation of every journalist\u2019s limited ability to transcend her own subjectivity was the new conventional wisdom. There were always dissenters and holdouts, to be sure; but the smartest writers on both the left and the right seemed to have internalized this new way of thinking. So imagine my surprise and even dismay when I found out that Ezra Klein \u2014 one of the many journalists who built a successful career by coming out of the blogosphere and tweaking old media for its faux-objective habits \u2014 began telling people that his much-anticipated new website\u2019s goal would be to \u201cexplain the news\u201d to readers. And imagine my disappointment when the site, which came to be known as Vox, had an inaugural post, a self-explainer of sorts, that pronounced that its \u201cend goal\u201d wasn\u2019t \u201ctelling you what just happened, or how we feel about what just happened,\u201d but rather to \u201cmak[e] sure you understand what just happened.\u201d Suddenly Klein, the guy who cut his teeth at the American Prospect, was telling readers he could make them \u201cunderstand what just happened\u201d without \u201ctelling you \u2026 how we feel about what just happened.\u201d (I should note that Klein has previously disavowed liberalism, telling the New Republic\u2019s Alec MacGillis, \u201cI don\u2019t really think of myself as a liberal. That\u2019s not the project I\u2019m part of, which is to let the facts take me where they do.\u201d Liberals, you see, don\u2019t care for facts.)\n\nSomewhat encouragingly, Klein\u2019s lead-off big piece for Vox was a story about \u201chow politics makes us stupid\u201d that focused on yet more research showing that smart, highly informed people were in fact often more rather than less likely to let their fundamental values and beliefs change the way they interpreted new information. By choosing to get things started with a piece about the inescapable nature of subjectivity, Klein seemed to be making a subtle recognition that no one can \u201cexplain the news\u201d without having their own biases color their explanation. Vox just wrapped up its first week ever, though \u2014 and there are examples of pieces that both do and don\u2019t embrace the view from nowhere \u2014 so only time will tell whether Klein and company understand that we\u2019re all, in Klein\u2019s extremely loaded choice of words, a little \u201cstupid.\u201d\n\nConsiderably less encouraging, although far less surprising, has been the new version of FiveThirtyEight, data whiz Nate Silver\u2019s ESPN-backed revamp of what used to be a mainly politics-focused prediction site into a more sweeping general interest stop to learn about the world from what Silver calls the \u201cdata journalism\u201d perspective. In a very long manifesto that served as the site\u2019s formal introduction, Silver outlines where he sees flaws in modern journalism practice and why he believes a more data-centric approach is needed in the market. Much of his criticism is fair and some of it is absolutely true (journalists, this one included, are disproportionately innumerate; and his knocks on Peggy Noonan and George Will are spot-on). But while Silver correctly notes that \u201cobjectivity\u201d as it\u2019s understood in some newsrooms \u2014 such as his former haunt, the New York Times \u2014 is \u201coften taken to be synonymous with neutrality or nonpartisanship,\u201d he mistakenly concludes that the biggest problem with the model is simply a lack of statistical analysis. \u201cThe journalistic notion of objectivity, however flawed,\u201d he writes, \u201cat least creates some standard by which facts are introduced and presented to readers.\u201d In other words, say what you want about the view from nowhere \u2014 at least it\u2019s an ethos.", "article_metadata": {"description": "New work by Silver and two other influential reporters should have you worried about the future of journalism", "author": "Elias Isquith", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "New work by Silver and two other influential reporters should have you worried about the future of journalism", "title": "Objectively bad: Ezra Klein, Nate Silver, Jonathan Chait and return of the \u201cview from nowhere\u201d", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/04/12/objectively_bad_ezra_klein_nate_silver_jonathan_chait_and_return_of_the_view_from_nowhere/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/04/chait_silver_klein.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "New work by Silver and two other influential reporters should have you worried about the future of journalism", "creator": "@eliasisquith", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/04/chait_silver_klein.jpg", "title": "Objectively bad: Ezra Klein, Nate Silver, Jonathan Chait and return of the \u201cview from nowhere\u201d", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Objectively bad: Ezra Klein, Nate Silver, Jonathan Chait and return of the \u201cview from nowhere\u201d", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Barack Obama, CNN, data journalism, explain the news, Ezra Klein, FiveThirtyEight, FiveThirtyEight.com, george will, Jay Rosen, Jonathan Chait, Lee Atwater, Nate Silver, New York Magazine, Paul Krugman, Peggy Noonan, Race, The New York Times, view from nowhere, Vix.com, Vox", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfad4\"", "article_summary": "Or, to pick an example considerably less sexy than Daft Punk and fashion, look at the recent moves of three of the political press\u2019 most influential writers: Ezra Klein, Nate Silver and Jonathan Chait.\nIndeed, journalism is impossible if its practitioners don\u2019t acknowledge the existence of at least some kind of baseline objective reality.\nConservatives, of course, ridiculed the line; children of the ever-cheery Ronald Reagan that they are, ambiguity and nuance is not really their thing.\nIt\u2019s not a perfect model, by any means, but it has one huge advantage over the previous standard: It\u2019s honest.\nBut the millions of Americans who voted for Ross Perot and Pat Buchanan in the 1990s would beg to differ."}
