Singer Tweet opening up about depression and actress Lisa Nicole Carson writing about living with bipolar disorder are just two of the few stories about Black people and mental health that make it to our eyes.\n\nMillions of American\u2019s suffer from mental illness, but in our community there\u2019s a hush hush policy on the disease. While the signs can be overt as emotional outbursts or violent fits, others aren\u2019t so easy to detect. It could be your co-worker who sweats excessively because they\u2019re tense at staff meetings, or your best friend whose surprisingly quiet and reserved lately due to the loss of a recent relationship. We all walk in the midst of people in need for mental health attention everyday. Some of us are recognizing the need for this and taking action, While a lot of our people still have this thing about mental illness.\n\n\u201cThis thing\u201d we speak about keeps many of our people from reaching the doctor and discussing our feelings. In a culture where we don\u2019t speak about certain things, going to a shrink is counterculture in a way. However, mental illness in the Black community is undeniable. The numbers speak where mouths don\u2019t express the need. According to Mental Health America adult Blacks run a 20% greater risk of reporting psychological distress. Experts say that a number of factors help account for this increased risk. Barriers include attitudinal differences that affect the openers to address the issue, cultural disregard for mental health issues and environmental differences contribute to the growing gap of knowledge about mental health in the Black community.\n\nLatria Graham\u2019s article for Marie Claire shows us the clear challenge of living in a world as a youth where mental illness isn\u2019t embraced by Black culture.\n\nIn the article, Graham writes:\n\n\u201cMy parents diminished the severity of my issues. My mom went so far as to call my disorder a \u201cwhite girl\u2019s problem\u201d\u2014she said it was basically a luxury issue. I am the daughter of a farmer and an entrepreneur, and their day-to-day problem-solving skills are meant to handle issues like food, water, shelter, and money, so mental health just wasn\u2019t a tangible enough issue.\u201d\n\nStudents from low income backgrounds feel the impact of their communities even as they enter the assumed safe space of schools. School leaders are concerned about the traumatic experiences their students go through. Bejeray Morrison, a high school college counselor for a low income high school in Chicago, says that it\u2019s almost impossible to expect students to not be affected by the places they reside.\n\n\u201cAdulthood is often thrust upon our youth before it\u2019s their time. Not only do they start working early, but they start grappling with deep emotional issues before their minds are fertile enough to embrace it,\u201d Morrison explained. \u201cThere\u2019s a constant reminder of pain as my students walk down the street. Friends and family dying has got to shake the minds of our kids. Why wouldn\u2019t it ?\u201d\n\nMorrison has been working in the South Chicago community for years and she sees firsthand the impact that trauma has on college attendance. In her quest to get kids enrolled in college, she unpacks the layers of emotional baggage that comes with this issue of mental health support.\n\n\u201cWe need more mental health counselors that embrace our student\u2019s story. They don\u2019t know they\u2019re hurting because society tells them they\u2019re supposed to be tough. So they go off to college and aren\u2019t learned to be self aware, reflective and seek out the appropriate support. Literally our kids won\u2019t ask for help. My fight is for the kids who don\u2019t get the chance to have a clear conscious.\u201d\n\nMental Health America Adult says that Blacks living below poverty are two to three times more likely to report serious psychological distress than those living above poverty. Because of this, public schools on all levels have started to identify the need for mental health support in the schools. Social-emotional learning is a popular component at many primary and secondary schools. First Lady of New York City, Chirlane McCray, said the city is pooling its efforts to address the mental health needs of New York City Public School students.\n\n\u201cWe also plan to teach social\u2013emotional learning to students in about 90,000 pre-K programs and early learning sites, and we will provide every New York City public school with a mental health consultant who can support the school in emergency cases and create curricula.\u201d\n\nPresident Obama\u2019s new Mental Health and Substance Use Disorder Parity Task Force was created to address this vast need. The plan will fill a big mental health gap which is lack of insurance coverage, a problem that 29% of Black people say they have. He released a memorandum outlining this plan to erase America\u2019s growing problem:\n\n\u201cMy Administration has made behavioral health a priority and taken a number of steps to improve the prevention, early intervention, and treatment of mental health and substance use disorders. These actions are especially important in light of the prescription drug abuse and heroin epidemic as well as the suicide and substance use-related fatalities that have reversed increases in longevity in certain populations. One important response has been the expansion and implementation of mental health and substance use disorder parity protections to ensure that coverage for these benefits is comparable to coverage for medical and surgical care. The Affordable Care Act builds on the Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act to expand mental health and substance use disorder benefits and Federal parity protections for more than 60 million Americans\u201d\n\nPlease make sure your politicians are supporting opening more mental health facilities.
