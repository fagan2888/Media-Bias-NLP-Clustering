The Feb. 4 op-ed by Newt Gingrich and Tom Daschle, “A bipartisan Obamacare solution,” confirmed that the only problem with the Affordable Care Act is the president (and Congress) who passed it. Apparently “repeal and replace” has been updated to “mention the states and change the name.”

Mr. Gingrich, a former House speaker, boasted of his idea that states can opt out of Obamacare, provided their replacement insurance product “offer[s] coverage that is at least as comprehensive as the ACA’s essential health benefits package; that is at least as affordable; that insures at least a comparable number of residents; and that maintains federal deficit neutrality.” Also, the provisions requiring the coverage of patients’ preexisting conditions must be maintained. The only change I can tell is that the individual mandate may be waived. But waiving it would cause insurance premiums to rise, which would violate the requirements above.

I’m not quite sure why Mr. Daschle, a former Senate majority leader, would attach his name to this boastful Republican rebranding effort. It is clearly intended only to mollify opponents of Obamacare by changing the name but, because of a lack of any better ideas on the Republican side, not changing the policy much. Or, in other words, the same product in a different package.
