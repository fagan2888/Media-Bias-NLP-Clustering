Fox contributor Bernard Goldberg told Bill O’Reilly that Republican candidate Dr. Ben Carson “has said so many ridiculous things,” that “he makes Joe Biden sound like Winston Churchill.” Ruh-Roh!

Carson had appeared on The O’Reilly Factor earlier in the night and he once again attempted to explain his comments, made on Meet The Press last weekend, where he said he “I would not advocate that we put a Muslim in charge of this nation. I absolutely would not agree with that.”

Goldberg didn’t mince his words.

GOLDBERG: This comment that Ben Carson made and his pathetic, disingenuous, explanation earlier tonight on the show and before – this is only the latest ridiculous comment this man has made. He said that America is like Nazi Germany because we squelch dissent. He said that ObamaCare is the worst thing that has happened to this country since slavery. He has said that some people go to prison straight and come out gay. I know he has either apologized or “clarified” all of these ridiculous comments but he made them. He makes Joe Biden sound like Winston Churchill. …He has said so many ridiculous things, I don’t think he’s qualified to be president.
