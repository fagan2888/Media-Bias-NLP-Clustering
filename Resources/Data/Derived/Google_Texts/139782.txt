While the Apalachicola River appears to be stabilizing, the Chipola River will continue to rise which could continue to impact Gulf County. The Office of Emergency Management is asking that all individuals affected, or expecting to be affected, by the flooding remain vigilant about preparations for sustainment throughout next week. It is important that all residents who intend to remain in their homes keep supplies on hand that include water, batteries, medications, and non-perishable foods.

Checkpoints have been set up on Lake Grove Road and on Doc Whitfield Road. Passes will be given to local residents only. Local residents will be allowed to travel unless the roads become unsafe.
