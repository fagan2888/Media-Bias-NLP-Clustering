The Conservatives were projected to become the official opposition in Parliament, with the left-leaning New Democratic Party in third.\n\nLiberal supporters at the party's campaign headquarters broke into cheers and whistles when television projected that Trudeau would be the next prime minister.\n\nTop Trudeau advisor Gerald Butts tweeted \"Amazing work #TeamTrudeau. Breathtaking really\".\n\nAt the Conservative election headquarters in Calgary, where Harper is due to speak later, supporters sat quietly, staring at giant TV screens reporting results.\n\nTrudeau, 43, the photogenic son of former prime minister Pierre Trudeau, vaulted from third place to lead the polls in the last days of the campaign, overcoming Conservative attacks that he is too inexperienced to govern.\n\nWhile the final vote count was not yet complete, the early results suggested the center-left Liberals could even win a majority of Parliament's 338 seats.\n\nThe win marks a swing toward a more multilateral approach in global politics by the Canadian government, which has distanced itself from the United Nations in recent years.\n\nTrudeau has said he will repair Canada\u2019s cool relations with the Obama administration, withdraw Canada from the combat mission against Islamic State militants in favor of humanitarian aid, and tackle climate change.\n\nThe former teacher took charge of the party just two years ago and guided it out of the political wilderness with a pledge of economic stimulus and stirring appeals for a return to social liberalism.\n\nBorn to a sitting prime minister who came to power in 1968 on a wave of popular support dubbed \"Trudeaumania,\" Trudeau will become the second-youngest prime minister in Canadian history and brings an appeal more common in movie stars than statesmen.\n\nCriticized for being more style than substance, Trudeau has used attacks on his good looks and privileged upbringing to win over voters, who recalled his father's rock-star presence and an era when Canada had some sizzle on the world stage.\n\nPierre Trudeau, who died in 2000, was in power for 15 years - with a brief interruption - and remains one of the few Canadian leaders to be known abroad.\n\nThe Trudeau victory weakened the Canadian dollar. Financial market players had praised the Conservative government for its steady hand in economic management, which had spared Canada the worst of the global financial malaise.\n\nTrudeau has pledged to run small budget deficits and spend on infrastructure to stimulate economic growth, which has been anemic for years. He has also promised to raise taxes on high-income Canadians and reduce them for the middle class.\n\nPolitical pundits have already began to speculate on the makeup of a Trudeau government while pondering what caused the downfall of Harper, 56, who has been criticized for his aloof personality but won credit for economic management in a decade of global fiscal uncertainty.\n\n(Writing by Andrea Hopkins; Editing by Amran Abocar, Lisa Shumaker and Alan Crosby)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "MONTREAL/CALGARY (Reuters) - Canada's Liberal party, led by Justin Trudeau, won a stun", "title": "Liberals win Canadian election, ousting Harper: TV projects", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/10/19/Liberals-win-Canadian-election-ousting-Harper-TV-projects", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/canada-election_3.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/10/19/Liberals-win-Canadian-election-ousting-Harper-TV-projects", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/canada-election_3.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "MONTREAL/CALGARY (Reuters) - Canada's Liberal party, led by Justin Trudeau, won a stun", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "The projected win ends the Conservatives' nine-year run in power and reflected a political shift away from Harper's brand of fiscal and cultural conservatism.\nLiberal supporters at the party's campaign headquarters broke into cheers and whistles when television projected that Trudeau would be the next prime minister.\nAt the Conservative election headquarters in Calgary, where Harper is due to speak later, supporters sat quietly, staring at giant TV screens reporting results.\nThe Conservatives were projected to become the official opposition in Parliament, with the left-leaning New Democratic Party in third.\nMONTREAL/CALGARY (Reuters) - Canada's Liberal party, led by Justin Trudeau, won a stunning election victory on Monday and toppled the Conservative government of Prime Minister Stephen Harper, according to unanimous projections by Canada's major television networks."}
