Burwell, came from longtime Obamacare opponents who claim that, because of a key phrase in the law, the federal government may provide tax credit subsidies only in states that operate their own health insurance exchanges. Thirty-four states declined to establish these marketplaces, and instead left that responsibility in the hands of the federal government.\n\nIf the Supreme Court rules for the plaintiffs in this case, it would eliminate health insurance subsidies for 7.5 million low- and moderate-income people in those states, causing most of them to become uninsured when their premiums become unaffordable without financial assistance.\n\nHere's how the numbers break down in each state with a federally operated health insurance exchange.\n\n\n\nInfographic by Alissa Scheller for The Huffington Post. Jonathan Cohn and Jesse Rifkin contributed reporting.\n\nUPDATE: June 4 -- The numbers displayed on this map are derived from a report that counted health insurance exchange enrollment as of Feb. 22, which the Department of Health and Human Services published on March 10. The department released new data on June 2, detailing enrollment as of March 31. According to the new report, 7.3 million people were covered by plans purchased via the federally operated health insurance exchanges in the 34 states subject to the Supreme Court ruling, and 6.4 million of them received subsidies. The new report includes additional information about each state, but does not update the calculation of average unsubsidized premiums.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Supreme Court is expected to issue a decision in a major new lawsuit against Obamacare this June, and the health coverage for millions hangs in the b...", "sailthru.expire_date": "2015-05-29 07:34:02 -0400", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "The Supreme Court is expected to issue a decision in a major new lawsuit against Obamacare this June, and the health coverage for millions hangs in the b...", "title": "Here's How Many People In Each State May Not Be Able To Afford Insurance If The Supreme Court Rules Against Obamacare", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/05/28/obamacare-supreme-court-states_n_7422438.html", "image": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2926342/images/o-SUPREME-COURT-OBAMACARE-RULING-facebook.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Supreme Court is expected to issue a decision in a major new lawsuit against Obamacare this June, and the health coverage for millions hangs in the b...", "creator": "JeffYoung", "image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2926342/images/o-SUPREME-COURT-OBAMACARE-RULING-facebook.jpg", "height": 1000}, "title": "Here's How Many People In Each State May Not Be Able To Afford Insurance If The Supreme Court Rules Against Obamacare", "site": "@HuffPostPol", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-05-28 07:34:02 -0400", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=7422438", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "obamacare supreme court,obamacare supreme court states,obamacare supreme court case,obamacare supreme court lawsuit,obamacare lawsuit,king v. burwell,obamacare,health care,health care reform,jeffrey young,Health Insurance,uninsured", "article": {"section": "Politics", "tag": "obamacare supreme court,obamacare supreme court states,obamacare supreme court case,obamacare supreme court lawsuit,obamacare lawsuit,king v. burwell,obamacare,health care,health care reform,jeffrey young,Health Insurance,uninsured", "published_time": "2015-05-28 07:34:02 -0400", "modified_time": "2015-06-05 11:59:01 -0400"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfe23\"", "article_summary": "Here's how the numbers break down in each state with a federally operated health insurance exchange.\nThe Supreme Court is expected to issue a decision in a major new lawsuit against Obamacare this June, and the health coverage for millions hangs in the balance.\nThe new report includes additional information about each state, but does not update the calculation of average unsubsidized premiums.\nAccording to the new report, 7.3 million people were covered by plans purchased via the federally operated health insurance exchanges in the 34 states subject to the Supreme Court ruling, and 6.4 million of them received subsidies.\nIf the Supreme Court rules for the plaintiffs in this case, it would eliminate health insurance subsidies for 7.5 million low- and moderate-income people in those states, causing most of them to become uninsured when their premiums become unaffordable without financial assistance."}
