Bresnick, who previously served as executive director of Obama\u2019s Financial Fraud Enforcement Task Force, under which Operation Choke Point was created. \u201cMembers of the industry have raised their hands in frustration and simply avoided lines of business typically associated with higher risk. This reaction to [the Justice Department\u2019s] enforcement initiative, and similar matters brought by the Federal Trade Commission and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, is certainly understandable.\u201d\n\nBresnick addressed the issue in an op-ed for American Banker.\n\nAccording to government documents, Operation Choke Point was designed by the Justice Department in 2012 to \u201cattack Internet, telemarketing, mail, and other mass market fraud against consumers, by choking fraudsters\u2019 access to the banking system.\u201d\n\nCritics of the program say it was used to put the financial squeeze on entire industries the Obama administration doesn\u2019t like, such as firearms sellers and payday lenders.\n\nIn addressing what he referred to as \u201cconsequences\u201d of Operation Choke Point, Bresnick called for government officials to work \u201cclosely\u201d with banks to solve problems he says the program created.\n\n\u201cOnly when the government truly understands the consequences of its actions (especially the unintended consequences), acknowledges those concerns to those directly affected, and works closely with them to address the challenges they face, can we expect that the multitude of good actors who desperately want to avoid the last resort of de-risking will be able to do so with relative comfort,\u201d he wrote.\n\nThe concept of \u201cde-risking\u201d refers to banks\u2019 decision not to do business with industries that federal regulators flag as \u201chigh risk\u201d for fraud.\n\nIn 2011, for example, federal agencies sent thousands of U.S. banks formal guidance identifying categories of merchants the agencies considered high risk. That list featured \u201cfirearms\u201d and \u201cammunition\u201d sales, along with \u201cpornography.\u201d\n\nIn the article, Bresnick also suggested that corrective actions taken by the Justice Department and other federal banking regulating agencies to address some of the program\u2019s shortcomings are insufficient to stop banks from denying service to legal businesses.\n\n\u201cAll of the public statements in the world by [the Justice Department] or the regulators that they are only targeting the truly bad fraudsters, and that they are not going after minor violations, won\u2019t change the natural reaction to de-risk because there\u2019s simply no telling exactly where the government will decide to draw its phantom line.\u201d\n\nIn order to fix it, he said, government officials must work with banks instead of against them.\n\nPut simply, the government will get better results if it works with industry rather than against it, and acknowledges the terrible tension industry faces between serving a community and subjecting itself to increased scrutiny.\n\nOver the past two years, The Daily Signal has documented multiple cases of banks denying legal business owners access to banking services due to the \u201chigh risk\u201d nature of their industry.\n\nJust last month, a large bank in New England denied a line of credit to a former police officer who started a gun and tactical business in Monroe, Conn., telling the business owner on voicemail it \u201cno longer lends to firearms dealers.\u201d\n\n\n\nAfter reading Bresnick\u2019s article in American Banker, Brian J. Wise, president of U.S. Consumer Coalition, which has raised public awareness about Operation Choke Point, called the former Obama administration official \u201cthe ultimate capitalist.\u201d\n\n\u201cMichael Bresnick is the ultimate capitalist,\u201d Wise said. \u201cHe created Operation Choke Point at the expense of small businesses and their consumers. Now he is making money off of trying to help those businesses deal with the program he created. The losers in this game of regulatory cronyism are America\u2019s consumers.\u201d\n\nIn Bresnick\u2019s bio, he states that he \u201cpreviously served as executive director of President Obama\u2019s Financial Fraud Enforcement Task Force, under which Operation Choke Point was created.\u201d Bresnick now serves as chair of the financial services investigations and enforcement practice at Venable LLP.\n\nPrior to the publication of Bresnick\u2019s article, little was known about the inner workings of Operation Choke Point. Both U.S. Consumer Coalition and The Daily Signal were denied public requests for documents relating to the program.\n\n\u201cUntil today, the individuals responsible for this unconstitutional program refused to admit that the [Financial Fraud Enforcement Task Force] was responsible for managing the program,\u201d Wise said. \u201cIn fact, FOIAs by [U.S. Consumer Coalition] that requested documents that would prove the [Financial Fraud Enforcement Task Force] involvement had been stonewalled and ignored for years.\u201d\n\nThe Financial Fraud Enforcement Task Force, which Bresnick led, was created by Obama in November 2009.\n\n\u201c[W]hen President Obama created the Task Force in November 2009,\u201d Bresnick said in a 2013 speech, \u201che formed the largest federal, state, and local coalition ever assembled to investigate and prosecute financial fraud.\u201d\n\nIn that same speech, Bresnick said:\n\nIf we can eliminate the mass-marketing fraudsters\u2019 access to the U.S. financial system\u2014that is, if we can stop them from getting paid\u2014then we can significantly reduce the harm caused by this type of fraud[.] \u2026 We hope to close that access to the banking system\u2014effectively putting a chokehold on it\u2014and put a stop to this billion-dollar problem that has harmed so many American consumers.\n\nAccording to Bresnick\u2019s article, the Justice Department is still carrying out Operation Choke Point. \u201cLast month the prosecutors in [Justice Department\u2019s] Consumer Protection Branch, who led the investigations into [Operation Choke Point\u2019s] previous targets, filed a 39-count criminal indictment in Nevada of Gareth Long, owner and operator of the third-party payment processor V Internet Corp, LLC,\u201d he wrote.\n\nThe Daily Signal reached out to Bresnick, but he was not immediately available for comment.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A former Obama administration top official admitted Operation Choke Point had \u201cunintended but collateral consequences\u201d on banks and U.S. consumers.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A former Obama administration top official admitted Operation Choke Point had \u201cunintended but collateral consequences\u201d on banks and U.S. consumers.", "title": "Fmr.
