Source: UCLA\n\n\u201cAchieving a biomaterial that promotes rapid regeneration while maintaining structural support has been a holy grail in the field of tissue engineering,\u201d Di Carlo said in a press release. \u201cOur team has achieved this in an injectable form by combining tailored material chemistry and microfluidic fabrication of uniform spherical building blocks, each about the width of a human hair.\n\n\u201cOur technology is beautifully simple, as it utilizes any available chemistry to generate tiny gels that can be assembled into a large unit, leaving behind a path for cellular infiltration,\u201d Segura added.\n\nThe researchers expect to see the MAP gel used for a wide range of wounds, from lacerations and surgical wound closures to diabetic ulcers and large-area burn wounds, according to the release.\n\nReference:\n\nDi Carlo D, et al.
