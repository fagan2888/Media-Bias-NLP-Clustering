They are not eligible for Medicaid, the joint federal-state health insurance program for the poor, because Louisiana did not expand the low-income program, and Obamacare federal subsidies don't kick in until people are at 100 percent of the federal poverty level.\n\nBefore Obamacare, the 1990 Ryan White Act offered people with HIV/AIDS federal financial help in paying for AIDS drugs and health insurance premiums, especially in state-run, high-risk pools.\n\nObamacare, which bans insurers from discriminating against people with preexisting conditions, was designed to replace these high-risk pools.\n\nStarting on October 1, AIDS advocates and others in Louisiana \"were enrolling anyone and everyone we could\" through the Obamacare exchange, said Lucy Cordts of the New Orleans NO/AIDS Task Force.\n\nLast month, her clients and those of other AIDS groups began to hear from Louisiana Blue that their enrollments were in limbo because the company would not accept the Ryan White checks for premium payments.\n\nThe only other carrier that is refusing to accept such payments is Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Dakota, according to a CMS official.\n\nNorth Dakota Blue \"restricts premium payment from third parties including employers, providers, and state agencies,\" said spokeswoman Andrea Dinneen, but \"is currently reviewing its eligibility policies with respect to recipients of Ryan White Program funding.\"\n\n'SURE LOOKS LIKE DISCRIMINATION'\n\nHealthcare advocates are worried that the refusal to accept Ryan White payments is an effort by insurers to keep AIDS patients from enrolling in their plans and last month began pressing the issue, including with the office of Democratic Senator Mary Landrieu.\n\nIn an email reviewed by Reuters, a healthcare expert on Landrieu's staff wrote, \"BCBS LA told me their decision was not due to the CMS guidance or any confusion (as we thought before) but was in fact due to adverse selection concerns. I have also recently learned North Dakota's BCBS plan has implemented the same policy.\"\n\nJessica Stone, the Landrieu staff member, declined to elaborate on the email further or to discuss her interactions with Louisiana Blue.\n\nAdverse selection refers to the situation where an insurer attracts patients with chronic conditions and expensive care. Louisiana Blue's action \"sure looks to us like discrimination against sick people,\" said John Peller, vice president for policy at the AIDS Foundation of Chicago.\n\nAsked if it were engaging in efforts to avoid adverse selection by refusing to accept Ryan White payments for would-be customers with HIV/AIDS, Louisiana Blue said it was not trying to keep such customers out of its plans. \"We welcome all Louisiana residents who chose Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Louisiana,\" said Maginnis.\n\n(Reporting by Sharon Begley and Julie Steenhuysen; Editing by Peter Henderson and Prudence
