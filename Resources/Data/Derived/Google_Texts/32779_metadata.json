With the world watching America\u2019s every move, we can only ask that the \u201cstars\u201d at least try to make us look good. But with constant miseducation and the public\u2019s poor understanding of the basic political platforms, many voters feel frustrated, hopeless, and ready for relocation to Canada.\n\nFox News GOP Debates\n\nFollowing a series of debates that some have described as mere buffoonery, Fox News will take on the GOP candidates today in Detroit, Michigan. Miles away from the recent water filtration crisis, Republican hopefuls will have their chance to make their claims to lead the Republican ticket for the presidency. The question from voters should be: will they finally discuss their ideas and platform or continue to make waves with comedic performances that evade the real issues?\n\nMost consider this election season a choice between few evils. Tonight, as you tune in to evaluate each GOP candidate\u2019s stance on the important topics, it\u2019s important to first understand the Republican party platform.\n\nThe Republican Platform\n\nWith business and economy as the backbone of the party, will the lives of individuals be a first thought? Will #AllLivesMatter or just the livelihood of big business? Before casting your ballot and securing the next leader of the free world, or at least the GOP, consider the facts presented by campaigners.\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s Basic Health Scare Plan\n\nTake a look at the new Health Care Plan proposed by Donald Trump. In the short document, voters can read of the call to completely repeal Obamacare. After months of tension caused by incomprehensible legislative details, reforms, reforms, and more reforms, Trump sums up his feelings of Obamacare and his first duty, should he be elected, with these introductory words.\n\n\u201cThis legislation, passed by totally partisan votes in the House and Senate and signed into law by the most divisive and partisan President in American history, has tragically but predictably resulted in runaway costs, websites that don\u2019t work, greater rationing of care, higher premiums, less competition and fewer choices. Obamacare has raised the economic uncertainty of every single person residing in this country. As it appears Obamacare is certain to collapse of its own weight, the damage done by the Democrats and President Obama, and abetted by the Supreme Court, will be difficult to repair unless the next President and a Republican congress lead the effort to bring much-needed free market reforms to the healthcare industry\u2026But none of these positive reforms can be accomplished without Obamacare repeal. On day one of the Trump Administration, we will ask Congress to immediately deliver a full repeal of Obamacare.\u201d\n\nObviously a \u201cfull repeal\u201d contradicts Trump\u2019s support of certain features of the Affordable Care Act. During debates he seemed engaged, to an extent.\n\n\u201cI want to keep pre-existing conditions. I think we need it. I think it\u2019s a modern age. And I think we have to have it.\u201d\n\nAccording to his minimalist reform plan, he promised a plan that was \u201cmuch better\u201c. All, however, seems based on the premise that the key to affordable health care is competitive markets which agencies can sell across state lines. The downside to such a theory is that larger, reputable companies are likely to swallow the little fish, benefiting only the corporate industry and even going against the GOP\u2019s desire to boost small businesses.\n\nThe winner under Trump\u2019s plan is big pharma and insurance industry leaders. The ultimate loser? You, the insured.\n\nMarco Rubio, Where Does He Stand?\n\nRubio, on the other hand, has a textbook adherence to the goals of the party. So much, it makes one wonder what will HE do? Of the few things the candidate makes a deliberate stance, small business tax reform is at the forefront. Under his tax reform plan, Rubio plans to cut taxes for small businesses to 25 percent; allow businesses to immediately expense new investments, and permanently repeal the death tax.\n\nAlthough critical of Trump\u2019s health care plan, Rubio has made the following clear, he will expand access to health coverage through \u201cadvanceable, refundable tax credits\u201d usable for insurance purchases. And, that\u2019s about all he\u2019s made clear on health care policy. Rubio was one of many to \u201cnay\u201d the Affordable Healthcare Act.\n\nTed Cruz and Medicare\n\nAbout all you\u2019ll hear from Cruz is his support of affordable health care for elderly and competitive marketplaces that cross state lines, just like everyone else and his party platform. After promising to repeal every line of Obamacare, Cruz was asked to share his plans. His response, the \u201cmost pragmatic, the most prudent\u201d thing to do is repeal the law and start over then, expand marketplace competitiveness allowing Americans to buy health insurance across state lines.\n\nUnfortunately, his party has already beat him to the punch regarding affordable healthcare for the elderly. The GOP, creators of Medicare, are also great supporters of this benefit for all over age 65.\n\nInformed Voters = Informed Decisions\n\nSo, as you tune in to the debates tonight, reflect on the words coming from each candidate. Do they stand in support of their platform? If not, how far will those promises go? Have they really provided best laid plans to \u201cmake America great again,\u201d or have they simply sensationalized the most important season for America\u2019s voters with hoopla and irrelevant distractions. YOU be the judge!\n\nBut remember, if all lives really matter, your health care, your rights, and your future should be the biggest concern in the Fox News debates.\n\n[Photo Credit: Image by Anthony Antonello]", "article_metadata": {"description": "GOP hopefuls have quietly ignored the details of how they will make America great again, no health care reform plans or clear promises, only the party platform.", "og": {"site_name": "The Inquisitr News", "description": "GOP hopefuls have quietly ignored the details of how they will make America great again, no health care reform plans or clear promises, only the party platform.", "title": "Fox News, The GOP, And Trump\u2019s Health Care (Scare) Plan", "url": "http://www.inquisitr.com/2850806/fox-news-the-gop-and-trumps-health-care-scare-plan/", "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/GOP-Candidates-3-900x440.jpg", "article": {"published_time": "2016-03-03T19:55:45+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-03T23:21:50+00:00"}, "type": "article"}, "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/GOP-Candidates-3-900x440.jpg", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ed1c24", "datePublished": "2016-03-03T19:55:45+00:00", "fb": {"pages": 71179904752, "app_id": 164157850314499}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/assets/0cec37/dist/images/logos/inq-win.png", "keywords": "health care,donald trump,gop,2016 gop candidates,2016 gop debate,marco rubio,ted cruz,opinion", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "y_key": "f282393706a5fd85", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/GOP-Candidates-3-900x440.jpg", "height": 440, "width": 900}, "site": "@theinquisitr", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "GOP hopefuls have quietly ignored the details of how they will make America great again, no health care reform plans or clear promises, only the party platform."}, "viewport": "width=980"}, "article_summary": "Donald Trump\u2019s Basic Health Scare PlanTake a look at the new Health Care Plan proposed by Donald Trump.\nAlthough critical of Trump\u2019s health care plan, Rubio has made the following clear, he will expand access to health coverage through \u201cadvanceable, refundable tax credits\u201d usable for insurance purchases.\nBut remember, if all lives really matter, your health care, your rights, and your future should be the biggest concern in the Fox News debates.\nAll, however, seems based on the premise that the key to affordable health care is competitive markets which agencies can sell across state lines.\nTonight, as you tune in to evaluate each GOP candidate\u2019s stance on the important topics, it\u2019s important to first understand the Republican party platform."}
