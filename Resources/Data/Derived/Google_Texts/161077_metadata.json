The exchanges allow residents of each state to seek subsidized health coverage.\n\nThe government aims to sign up 7 million people in the first year. That number is expected to grow to 22 million in 2016, according to the Congressional Budget Office.\n\nRepublicans are bitterly opposed to the healthcare plan, which passed without a single Republican vote in Congress in 2010 and is seen by Obama's supporters as one of his greatest achievements as president.\n\nBarrasso said there is \"no question\" that the U.S. healthcare system needs reform, but at a lower cost, not a higher one.\n\nHe cited a Kaiser Family Foundation study this week showing that the average family premium for people getting health insurance through their employers has risen by nearly $3,000 from when Obama took office in January 2009.\n\nThe Obama administration also cited the study, which came out earlier this week. It stressed that the study showed that insurance premiums will be more affordable on the healthcare exchanges.\n\n\"In fact, if the ACA were repealed, individuals and families could see rate shock, with $1,000 to $8,000 in premium hikes based on data from the Kaiser Family Foundation,\" the White House official said on Saturday.\n\n(Reporting by Patricia Zengerle; Additional reporting by Robert Rampton; Editing by Eric Beech)", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Reuters Editorial", "Author": "Reuters Editorial", "DCSext.PageNumber": 1, "twitter": {"description": "Weeks before healthcare exchanges under President Barack Obama's healthcare overhaul open next month, a Republican senator attacked the plan on Saturday by saying Americans may experience \"sticker shock\" from higher prices.", "title": "Republican U.S. senator warns of 'sticker shock' from Obamacare", "image": "http://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20130907&t=2&i=788371549&w=&fh=545px&fw=&ll=&pl=&sq=&r=CBRE9861ASJ00", "creator": "@Reuters", "site": "@Reuters", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "DCSext.rChannel": "Article -
