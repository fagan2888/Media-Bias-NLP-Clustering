On Saturday morning they delivered 1,564 pairs to the distribution center in North Topeka.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019ll be enough to last us awhile,\u201d Ireland told troop leader Michelle McDaniel as he looked into a giant bin full of socks.\n\nEarlier this year the girls toured the shelter where many of them learned that homelessness could affect children too, McDaniels said.\n\n\u201cThey realized that kids from their school could have been in the shelter,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it was really moving for them.\u201d\n\nThe girls decided to make the shelter a part of earning a Bronze Award, an achievement in Girl Scouts for recognizing a need in the community and working to raise money or supplies. McDaniels said the girls were going to build personal hygiene packs for shelter guests originally, but the mission had plenty of those, so they chose socks.\n\nIn May, they began raising money and seeking donations of new, not used, socks.\n\nKnowing children like her would benefit made 11-year-old Joy Childs proud.\n\n\u201cI just think that would be really hard to cope with,\u201d Childs said. \u201cWe want to do whatever we can.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "News, Local, Luke Ranker", "og": {"site_name": "CJOnline.com", "description": "Socks, for most, are an afterthought, more for comfort than style.  \nBut for hundreds of Topekans, having socks is a luxury they simply can't afford, said Wayne Ireland, director of Topeka Rescue Mission's distribution center.", "title": "Local Girl Scout troop collects thousands of socks for Topeka Rescue Mission", "url": "http://cjonline.com/news/2015-08-08/local-girl-scout-troop-collects-thousands-socks-topeka-rescue-mission", "image": "http://cjonline.com/sites/default/files/14627084.jpg", "type": "article"}, "description": "Socks, for most, are an afterthought, more for comfort than style.
