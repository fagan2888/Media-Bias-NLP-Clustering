The 5 biggest Facebook hoaxes\n\nBy Doug Gross\n\nIntentionally or not, the latest round of misleading stories making viral waves has made it harder to tell truth from fiction.\n\nHere\u2019s a quick guide to some of the most viral fake stories this week:\n\nFacebook fees\n\nNo, Facebook is not going to start charging you. Facebook even created a help page just to say this: \u201cFacebook is a free site and will never require that you pay to continue using the site.\u201d\n\nThe page then goes on to explain that, yes, you may pay money for some games and other apps you play on the site. And if you go over your mobile phone\u2019s data limit while using Facebook, you\u2019ll have to pay for that, too.\n\nThat still too vague for you? Maybe leaves a little too much wiggle room? Well, then, let\u2019s try this entry under Common Myths About Facebook.\n\nQuestion: Will Facebook ever charge for service?\n\nAnswers: No. We will always keep Facebook a free service for everyone.\n\nWhen contacted, a Facebook spokeswoman simply pointed to those two entries instead of providing a response. We\u2019re guessing if someone had to answer this question for Facebook every time it came up, it would be a full-time job.\n\nObamacare and Ebola coverage\n\nThere\u2019s no reason to think your health insurance would treat a case of Ebola any differently than it would any other illness because of Obamacare. But a false viral story making the rounds may have some people convinced otherwise.\n\nAnd, for that, we can thank National Report.\n\nThat was where the most recent \u201cpay for Facebook\u201d story originated, and it\u2019s where this doozy comes from, too.\n\nNational Report is a satire site, though it\u2019s sometimes hard to tell if you just breeze through the headline and first few sentences of a story.\n\nWe all know The Onion is fake news. (Well, almost all of us, anyway). But sites such as National Report and The Daily Currant aren\u2019t so well-known or, for that matter, nearly as funny.\n\nIn fact, the more cynical among us may think these sites are intentionally trying to drive traffic by pushing out seemingly real stories about hot topics.\n\nYou know \u2026 like how a controversial government policy addresses an unprecedented and frightening, if isolated, disease outbreak.\n\nNBA, NFL, Congress \u2026 or none of the above?\n\nIf you like football and you hate Congress, well, welcome to 97% of the population of the United States. (Full disclosure: We made up that statistic.)\n\nBut if you responded to the NFL\u2019s recent off-the-field troubles by sharing a post that shows that our lawmakers are bigger lawbreakers than our football stars, you fell for a fake.\n\nThe good people at Snopes, the Web\u2019s BS meter since 1995, are all over this one, as is PolitiFact.\n\nThe so-called statistics \u2014 36 members of Congress have been accused of spousal abuse, three have been in jail for assault, 84 were arrested for drunk driving in a single year \u2014 change from version to version. But these figures all go back to a 1999 online article that provided no source for its statistics and named none of the supposedly corrupt members of Congress.\n\nUnder scrutiny, it was later retracted.\n\nSorry, Pluto\u2019s still not a planet\n\nBut some smart people say it should be. So there\u2019s that.\n\nSpace geeks everywhere were saddened in 2006 when Pluto lost its status as our solar system\u2019s ninth planet.\n\nSo you can forgive them, perhaps for jumping the gun on social media when news appeared to hit recently that the tiny, chilly chunk of rock has been restored to its rightful place.\n\nCall this one a combination of enthusiasm, confusion and exaggeration.\n\nWhat actually happened was that the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics held a September 18 debate on whether Pluto should be restored to its full glory and four days later released the results of a vote by the audience.\n\nPluto won.\n\nBut in reporting that event, which has no official influence, many blogs and news sites appeared to go a bit too far, at least with their headlines.\n\n\u201cThe People Have Voted: Pluto is a Planet!\u201d Time blared. \u201cPluto Is a Planet Again, According to Harvard Astronomers,\u201d another blog announced.\n\nSo you can see how some of us who grew up with \u201cInterplanet Janet\u201d rushed to the incorrect conclusion that we have \u201cnine planets large and small\u201d again.\n\nDon\u2019t microwave your iPhone\n\nThanks, 4chan!\n\nWhen Apple\u2019s iOS 8, the new operating system for mobile devices such as its new iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, rolled out this month, some of the online message board\u2019s notorious pranksters greeted it by crafting a fake ad for a new service.\n\nWave, according to what we have to admit was a pretty authentic looking ad done in Apple\u2019s trademark style, is a feature that \u201callows your device to be charged wirelessly through microwave frequencies.\u201d\n\nJust pop your phone in the microwave, and the battery will be all charged up.\n\nWe\u2019d like to believe no one actually fell for this one. So, if you know otherwise, just don\u2019t tell us.", "article_metadata": {"description": "By Doug Gross (CNN) -- Seriously, don't believe everything you read on the Internet.
