From the AP:\n\nTo crack down on fraudulent claims, federal regulators ordered carriers to collect identifiable information. TerraCom Inc. and YourTel America, which are jointly owned, complied, but were so careless with the files that a reporter stumbled upon them during a simple Google search, according to the Federal Communications Commission. In a written statement released Friday, Dale Schmick, chief operating officer of TerraCom Inc. and YourTel America Inc., said the company has since increased its data security efforts and completed \u201cmultiple security audits to prevent future breaches from taking place.\u201d\n\nDoes this sound familiar? It should, because Obamacare has had similiar security breaches. Last year in Minnesota, an employee of Minnesota\u2019s healthcare exchange sent an unencryped file containing the personal data of 2,400 Minnesotans to an insurance agent. In Connecticut, the personal information of 400 enrollees was found in a backpack.\n\nThe government, at all levels, clearly has a problem with keeping personal information safe. While they\u2019re handing millions and billions of dollars of subsidies, perhaps they should spend some money on training to teach government employees and contractors to learn how to protect the personal information of Americans.", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "The public is astounded the Obama administration picked clients that can't be trusted with our info...", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=878142436", "og": {"site_name": "Independent Journal Review", "description": "The public is astounded the Obama administration picked clients that can't be trusted with our info...", "title": "Shocker: Two ObamaPhone Contractors are Busted for Posting Sensitive Customer Info Online", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://static.ijreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/21253526_SA.jpg", "height": 360}, "updated_time": "2014-10-25T15:15:10-04:00", "url": "http://www.ijreview.com/2014/10/192252-obamacare-obamaphone-common/", "type": "article"}, "is_article": 1, "twitter": {"description": "The public is astounded the Obama administration picked clients that can't be trusted with our info...", "title": "Shocker: Two ObamaPhone Contractors are Busted for Posting Sensitive Customer Info Online", "image": "http://static.ijreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/21253526_SA.jpg", "creator": "@kevinboyd1984", "site": "@injo", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Kevin Boyd", "robots": "noodp", "DC.date.issued": "2014-10-25T09:30:01-04:00", "wp-categories": 482, "fb": {"admins": 1116123001, "app_id": 251714254848821}, "p": {"domain_verify": "770b5b250556c52fa42a70dc373c541b"}, "published_at": "2014-10-25T09:30:01+00:00", "url": "http://www.ijreview.com/2014/10/192252-obamacare-obamaphone-common/", "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "wp-category-slugs": "nation", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/injoreview/", "section": "Nation", "published_time": "2014-10-25T09:30:01-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-25T15:15:10-04:00", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/kevinboyd1984"}, "post_id": 192252, "image": "http://static.ijreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/21253526_SA.jpg", "tags": "Nation", "is_https": 0}, "article_summary": "The phone program has recently become known as the \u201cObamaphone\u201d with the explosion in wireless technology.\nThe government, at all levels, clearly has a problem with keeping personal information safe.\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Two phone companies, TerraCom Inc. and YourTel America Inc., are facing a $10 million fine for posting the sensitive personal information of up to 300,000 customers on the Internet.\nIn Connecticut, the personal information of 400 enrollees was found in a backpack.\nThere\u2019s something else about both companies: they\u2019re both contractors for the Lifeline program, which subsidizes phone service for low-income families."}
