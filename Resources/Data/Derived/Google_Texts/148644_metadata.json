It is designed to help adults 19-64 who don\u2019t have health insurance.\n\nOtter says Idaho doesn\u2019t want to expand Medicaid and PCAP will help the 78,000 people who fall through the cracks of the current system.\n\nThe program would pay $32 a month to doctors for each patient. PCAP would develop treatment plans to manage chronic conditions and coordinate care. Patients would also have to pay a fee, based on their income.\n\nThe $30 million dollars to pay for the program would come from tobacco tax receipts. Otter says this is an alternative to expanding Medicaid through the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cThis is an achievable alternative that gives us total control, with no federal strings or mandates.\u201d\n\nUnder ACA, each state has the option to expand their Medicaid program. Otter has opposed such a move for Idaho.\n\nTo be eligible, the patient must have an income of around $981 a month. The program would provide basic lab tests, X-rays, pharmacy and limited office-based behavioral health services. Hospital stays, specialty care and trips to the Emergency Department are not covered. The County Indigent and State Catastrophic programs would continue to help pay for services not covered by PCAP.\n\nPCAP would coordinate care of chronic conditions including diabetes, heart disease, hypertension, depression and asthma.\n\nRichard Armstrong, director of the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare, said the program was an Idaho solution.\n\n\u201cWe all know tragic stories of people who delayed medical care because they could not afford it and suffered heartbreaking consequences. This plan connects our lowest income citizens to coordinated primary care that can help them improve their health and quality of life,\u201d Armstrong said.\n\nFind Samantha Wright on Twitter @samwrightradio\n\nCopyright 2016 Boise State Public Radio", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health", "description": "Governor C.L. \u201cButch\u201d Otter announced a new proposal Thursday that he says would help low income Idahoans get health care.
