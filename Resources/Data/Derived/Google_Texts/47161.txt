U.S. Senator Mike Lee came to the FOX 13 Studio Tuesday for an interview with Max Roth.

In the first video, Lee talks about NSA data collection and his war of words with New Jersey Governor Chris Christie. He also discusses his recent collaborations with Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont, which is a portion of the interview we didn't have time to show on Live@4.

In the second interview, Lee discusses his influence on presidential candidates Senators Ted Cruz, Rand Paul and Marco Rubio.

The third is a web-only series of questions addressing his relationship with Senator Orrin Hatch, his view of Supreme Court cases on ObamaCare and gay marriage, and his relationship with Jon Huntsman Jr. and Sr.
