A spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara in Manhattan declined to comment.\n\nThe government accused Novartis of providing discounts and rebates from 2005 to 2013 to induce at least 20 pharmacies to switch thousands of patients to Myfortic, an immunosuppressant.\n\nIt also said that from 2007 to 2012, Novartis offered patient referrals and rebates to BioScrip Inc (BIOS.O) so that pharmacy would recommend refills of Exjade, which is meant to reduce iron levels in patients.\n\nThe government alleged that these activities caused Medicare and Medicaid to pay tens of millions of dollars of improper reimbursements, and violated a federal anti-kickback law. Eleven U.S. states are co-plaintiffs. BioScrip settled for $11.7 million in January.\n\nMcMahon had on May 29 allowed the case to proceed, but said she wanted to further review the legal issues.\n\nIn her decision on Thursday, she said Congress \"gave absolutely no indication\" that it intended to limit the reach of the False Claims Act where kickbacks were concerned.\n\n\"Where a party falsely certifies compliance with the (anti-kickback law) in connection with a claim, the claim is 'false' as a matter of law, and so is not eligible for reimbursement,\" she wrote.\n\nMcMahon gave the government 21 days to again plead claims she dismissed.\n\nThe lawsuit stemmed from a whistleblower case by David Kester, a former Novartis respiratory account manager from Raleigh, North Carolina. He is also pursuing separate claims against Novartis and other companies regarding other drugs.\n\nThe case is U.S. v. Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corp, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 11-08196.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Jonathan Stempel", "Author": "Jonathan Stempel", "DCSext.PageNumber": 1, "twitter": {"description": "A Manhattan federal judge on Thursday said the U.S. Department of Justice may pursue most of its lawsuit accusing Novartis AG NOVN.VX of civil fraud for allegedly using kickbacks to boost sales of drugs covered by Medicare and Medicaid.", "creator": "@Reuters", "image": "http://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20140808&t=2&i=959562610&w=&fh=545px&fw=&ll=&pl=&sq=&r=LYNXMPEA7700A", "title": "Novartis loses new bid to dismiss U.S. lawsuit over kickbacks", "site": "@Reuters", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "DCSext.rChannel": "Article - News", "sailthru.tags": "US, NOVARTIS, LAWSUIT", "DCSext.ChannelList": "businessNews;Honda;Inspiration;everything;treasuryMarkets;Continental;Deals;MercedesBenz;Shell;Verizon;Amtrak;Amtrak2;yahoo3;Adfriendly1;echoActivityStream;ANZ;AllianzInvestments;FedExSMB;everythingButHugin;OutloudFeed;corporate_crime;CFA;trending-hp;regulation;samsung;newsproHome;cfaglobal;merrilledge;citianniversary;greenpeace;fedex_neg;BNY;Intel;BNYForesight", "keywords": "US,NOVARTIS,LAWSUIT,United States,New York", "DCSext.ContentType": "Article", "description": "A Manhattan federal judge on Thursday said the U.S. Department of Justice may pursue most of its lawsuit accusing Novartis AG NOVN.VX of civil fraud for allegedly using kickbacks to boost sales of drugs covered by Medicare and Medicaid.", "WT.cg_n": "Business", "DCSext.rCountry": "BETAUS", "DCSext.ContentChannel": "businessNews", "sailthru.date": "2014-08-08T01:53:56+0000", "sailthru.title": "Novartis loses new bid to dismiss U.S. lawsuit over kickbacks", "DCSext.ContentHeadline": "Novartis+loses+new+bid+to+dismiss+U.S.+lawsuit+over+kickbacks", "DCSext.ContentID": "USKBN0G801920140808", "WT.cg_s": "Business", "WT.z_inlinetype": "false", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20140808&t=2&i=959562610&w=&fh=50&fw=50&ll=&pl=&sq=&r=LYNXMPEA7700A", "news_keywords": "US;NOVARTIS;LAWSUIT;United States;New York", "robots": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "DCSext.PageTotal": 1, "DCSext.rAuthor": "Jonathan Stempel", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters"}, "sailthru.description": "A Manhattan federal judge on Thursday said the U.S. Department of Justice may pursue most of its lawsuit accusing Novartis AG NOVN.VX of civil fraud for allegedly using kickbacks to boost sales of drugs covered by Medicare and Medicaid.", "DCSext.DartZone": "us.reuters/business/article", "viewport": "width=1100", "sailthru.contenttype": "Article", "DCSext.ContentID_businessNews": "USKBN0G801920140808", "site edition": "Reuters", "og": {"site_name": "Reuters", "description": "A Manhattan federal judge on Thursday said the U.S. Department of Justice may pursue most of its lawsuit accusing Novartis AG NOVN.VX of civil fraud for allegedly using kickbacks to boost sales of drugs covered by Medicare and Medicaid.", "title": "Novartis loses new bid to dismiss U.S. lawsuit over kickbacks", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20140808&t=2&i=959562610&w=&fh=545px&fw=&ll=&pl=&sq=&r=LYNXMPEA7700A", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-novartis-lawsuit-idUSKBN0G801920140808", "article": {"section": "Business", "tag": "US,NOVARTIS,LAWSUIT,United States,New York", "published_time": "2014-08-08T01:53:56+0000", "modified_time": "2014-08-08T01:53:56+0000", "author": "Jonathan Stempel"}, "type": "article"}, "sailthru.image.full": "http://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20140808&t=2&i=959562610&w=&fh=545px&fw=&ll=&pl=&sq=&r=LYNXMPEA7700A", "REVISION_DATE": "Fri Aug 08 01:53:56 UTC 2014", "DCSext.contentversion": "original", "WT.z_navid": "nav-Text-businessNews"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd122b\"", "article_summary": "The lawsuit stemmed from a whistleblower case by David Kester, a former Novartis respiratory account manager from Raleigh, North Carolina.\nNovartis, which has offices in East Hanover, New Jersey, had objected to what it called the government's \"potentially limitless\" theory that any claims submitted by pharmacists who got kickbacks were tainted.\nHe is also pursuing separate claims against Novartis and other companies regarding other drugs.\nThe case is U.S. v.
