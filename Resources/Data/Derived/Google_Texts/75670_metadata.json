In New York there are half-a-million uninsured who will go to the health system and hospitals,\u201d he said.\n\nDe Blasio plans to pour around $500 million into the health and hospitals systems to help keep it afloat, WCBS 880\u2019s Rich Lamb reported.\n\nThe $82 billion spending plan also includes $70 million for a new police precinct in Southeast Queens that will serve Laurelton, Rosedale, Brookville and Springfield Gardens, 1010 WINS reported.\n\nThe FDNY will be getting $5 million to fund 50 new ambulance tours in an effort to reduce response times, WCBS 880\u2019s Marla Diamond reported.\n\n\u201cOur target for the most serious calls is to get to 90 percent of those in six minutes or less and currently we are not doing that,\u201d Fire Commissioner Daniel Nigro said. \u201cWe are going to do everything we can with the help of the mayor\u2019s budget to get that number down and get to New Yorkers in need quicker.\u201d\n\nThe department will concentrate its efforts in Queens and the Bronx, where response times have been slowest.\n\n\u201cThe department feels going forward we will provide a better service next year than we provided last year,\u201d Nigro said.\n\nAbout $289 million will cover bridge repairs, with most of the funds \u2014 approximately $244 million \u2014 going towards a roadway replacement job on the Ed Koch-Queensboro Bridge. About $32 million is also being set aside for repairs on the Brooklyn and Manhattan bridges.\n\n\u201cInfrastructure in our city is in need of repair and the administration is obviously focusing on that,\u201d Lori Ardito, First Deputy Commissioner of Transportation, told 1010 WINS.\n\nUnder the budget, the city will also triple the number of intensive-care mental health units at the Rikers Island jail complex. Correction Commissioner Joseph Ponte said the specialized units can improve safety by reducing jail violence.\n\nThe mayor said he will target $170-million for an alternative for younger inmates on Rikers Island.\n\nDe Blasio also reiterated a constant complaint that the city is not getting its fair share of state dollars.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not seeing a proliferation if you will of the state trying to cut back resources of New York city, and to off-load obligations on the city,\u201d he said.\n\nAs for the hospitals, the mayor said none of them will close, but they will have additional uses like mental health care. He said there won\u2019t be any layoffs, but cuts through attrition.\n\nThe budget blueprint must be approved by the City Council by the end of June.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Mayor Bill de Blasio's proposed executive budget will cover snow removal upgrades, a new police precinct, additional ambulance tours and more.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2016/04/26/de-blasio-2017-budget-address/", "image": {"width": 1500, "secure_url": "https://cbsnewyork.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/gettyimages-497723166.jpg?w=1500", "identifier": "https://cbsnewyork.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/gettyimages-497723166.jpg?w=1500", "height": 1001}, "type": "article", "description": "Mayor Bill de Blasio's proposed executive budget will cover snow removal upgrades, a new police precinct, additional ambulance tours and more.", "title": "Mayor De Blasio To Present $82 Billion Budget Plan"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://cbsnewyork.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/gettyimages-497723166.jpg?w=1500", "description": "Mayor Bill de Blasio's proposed executive budget will cover snow removal upgrades, a new police precinct, additional ambulance tours and more.", "site": "/CBSnewyork", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Mayor De Blasio To Present $82 Billion Budget Plan"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Breaking News, Sports, Weather, Traffic And The Best of NY", "fb": {"app_id": 148100721870411}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://newyork.cbslocal.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/50e3ae7b1a37ec6f5f022661f15b5473?s=16", "application-name": "CBS New York", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/CBSNewYork", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/CBSNewYork"}, "keywords": "de blasio budget, nyc spending budget, de blasio proposed budget, nyc 2017 budget plan", "google-site-verification": "44caXBf4kjHeKKAT7ZZ89NaCX25utL_yRSa-qGpwIhY", "bitly-verification": "98ab9c1eda26", "news_keywords": "de blasio budget, nyc spending budget, de blasio proposed budget, nyc 2017 budget plan"}, "article_summary": "As for the hospitals, the mayor said none of them will close, but they will have additional uses like mental health care.\nNEW YORK (CBSNewYork) \u2014 Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s proposed executive budget will cover snow removal upgrades, a new police precinct, additional ambulance tours and more.\n\u201cSometimes the little things can make a big difference \u2013 especially in a snowstorm,\u201d de Blasio said in a statement released before he delivers his budget address Tuesday afternoon.\nUnder the budget, the city will also triple the number of intensive-care mental health units at the Rikers Island jail complex.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not seeing a proliferation if you will of the state trying to cut back resources of New York city, and to off-load obligations on the city,\u201d he said."}
