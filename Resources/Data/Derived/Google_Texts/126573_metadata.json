More than half of the entire population has been displaced in a civil war now approaching its fifth year, and almost 4.3 million Syrian refugees are registered with the U.N. Millions are crowded into densely populated refugee camps in neighboring Turkey, Jordan, and Lebanon. Many live on the street, and few have access to basic resources or job prospects.\n\nTraffickers have taken advantage of Syrian refugees\u2019 desperation, in hopes of making money.\n\nAn Israeli man was arrested in Turkey today for organ trafficking. He came to Istanbul to try to convince impoverished Syrian refugees to sell their organs, in a story first reported by Turkey\u2019s Do\u011fan News Agency, and later by Israel\u2019s YNet and Germany\u2019s Deutsche Welle.\n\nAccording to Turkish and Israeli media, he was making plans to perform illegal surgeries on struggling Syrian refugees in small Turkish hospitals.\n\nThe alleged trafficker was identified in the Turkish media as Boris Walker, but YNet reports that the man is likely Boris Wolfman, a wanted criminal who fled Israel after being indicted for organ trafficking.\n\nWolfman was wanted by Interpol, the international police organization, for past organ trafficking.\n\nPatients illegally receiving an organ had to pay between \u20ac70,000 and \u20ac100,000, according to the indictment, whereas refugee organ donors received just tens of thousands of euros, resulting in tens of thousands of euros in profit for each transplant.\n\n\n\nPreviously, Wolfman was charged with organ trafficking and organizing illegal transplants in Kosovo, Azerbaijan, and Sri Lanka, in a series of alleged offenses committed between 2008 and 2014.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Trafficking is on the rise in largest refugee crisis since WWII.
