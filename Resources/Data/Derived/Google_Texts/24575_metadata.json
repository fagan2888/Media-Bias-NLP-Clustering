First premiums shot upward, and deductibles did the same. Next, insurers sharply narrowed provider networks, forcing many consumers to pay out of pocket if they want to \u201ckeep their doctor,\u201d as Barack Obama promised. Today, the Associated Press reports on another part of ObamaCare policy that may render insurance inadequate altogether \u2014 and consumers won\u2019t know it until the bill hits:\n\nYou just might want to pay attention to the latest health insurance jargon. It could mean thousands of dollars out of your pocket. The Obama administration has given the go-ahead for a new cost-control strategy called \u201creference pricing.\u201d It lets insurers and employers put a dollar limit on what health plans pay for some expensive procedures, such as knee and hip replacements. Some experts worry that patients could be surprised with big medical bills they must pay themselves, undercutting financial protections in the new health care law. That would happen if patients picked a more expensive hospital \u2014 even if it\u2019s part of the insurer\u2019s network. The administration\u2019s decision affects most job-based plans as well as the new insurance exchanges. Other experts say reference pricing will help check rising premiums.\n\nHow does \u201creference pricing\u201d work? It treats anything above the flat-rate limit covered by insurers as out-of-network costs, even if a patient is seeing a provider inside the network. Before ObamaCare, insurers would negotiate in-network prices for these procedures, and providers were forced to accept them as payment in full. Now providers will have much less incentive to agree to that kind of pricing structure, and instead go after the patients for the balance.\n\nAs if to rub salt in the wounds, the overage won\u2019t count as out-of-pocket expenses. The Obama administration loudly insisted on such caps to protect consumers, and used those caps as proof that the ACA would keep Americans from facing bankruptcy over an illness. Reference pricing all but buries the caps, though. If a patient needed a $40,000 operation but the insurer only had a $30K reference price on it, the patient would have to cough up the other $10,000 plus all of the deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses otherwise under the cap. The AP notes this with some concern:\n\nThat\u2019s crucial because under the health care law, most plans have to pick up the entire cost of care after a patient hits the annual out-of-pocket limit, currently $6,350 for single coverage and $12,700 for a family plan. Before the May 2 administration ruling, it was unclear whether reference pricing violated this key financial protection for consumers. Some experts are concerned. \u201cThe problem \u2026 from the patient\u2019s perspective is that at the end of the day, that is who gets left holding the bag,\u201d said Karen Pollitz of the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nYes, this is such an improvement over the system we had before.\n\nUpdate: I literally had to stop what I was doing when I saw this on Twitter from Gabriel Malor:\n\nIn which @EdMorrissey joins the VP Biden school of literally misusing the word literally: http://t.co/Am3dlCBbUe \u2014 Gabriel Malor (@gabrielmalor) May 16, 2014\n\nEr \u2026 yeah. I edited the paragraph in question.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "If you like your out-of-pocket caps \u2026.", "title": "\u201cReference pricing\u201d another way that ObamaCare will bite into wallets", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2014/05/16/reference-pricing-another-way-that-obamacare-will-bite-into-wallets/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-05-16T18:41:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-05-16T19:13:27+00:00"}, "keywords": "insurers, ObamaCare, out of pocket, reference pricing,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcafcd\"", "article_summary": "Before ObamaCare, insurers would negotiate in-network prices for these procedures, and providers were forced to accept them as payment in full.\nBefore the May 2 administration ruling, it was unclear whether reference pricing violated this key financial protection for consumers.\nOther experts say reference pricing will help check rising premiums.\n\u201cReference pricing\u201d another way that ObamaCare will bite into walletsposted at 2:41 pm on May 16, 2014 by Ed MorrisseyConsumers who bought into the \u201cObamaCare will bend the cost curve downward\u201d promise have had a tough year or so.\nReference pricing all but buries the caps, though."}
