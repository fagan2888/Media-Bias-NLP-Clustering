The bill, which already passed the House by unanimous vote, now goes before the full Senate.\n\nThe legislation was named in honor of Clay Hunt, a 26-year-old veteran who suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder and committed suicide in 2011. It aims to reduce a suicide epidemic that claims 22 veterans a day, according to the Stars and Stripes.\n\nThe bill calls for a centralized website for suicide prevention resources for veterans and for a review of the Department of Veterans Affairs mental health care and suicide prevention programs. It also seeks to help recruit psychiatrists for the VA by providing loan repayment programs for graduates in psychiatric medicine who commit to working for the VA.\n\nIn addition, the act would allow veterans access to care at Pine Rest, said Bob Nykamp, the hospital\u2019s chief operating officer. Those who wait too long for care in the VA system can have care provided by other organizations, such as Pine Rest.\n\nSen. Johnny Isakson, R-Georgia, the chairman of the Senate committee, said he hopes the bill is the first signed into law this year by President Obama, according to the Associated Press.\n\nThe suicide prevention act is needed to address the conditions of depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury that can arise in wartime service, Levin said.\n\n\u201cThe Clay Hunt bill is really important to ensuring we get care for our veterans,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s paying back and taking care of people who have taken care of us.\u201d\n\nMore information about the Clay Hunt Act is at congress.gov.\n\n\n\nSue Thoms covers health care for MLive/The Grand Rapids Press.
