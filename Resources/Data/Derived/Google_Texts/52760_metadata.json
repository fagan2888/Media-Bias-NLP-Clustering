In the old days the Lord of the Manor could do what he wanted, but the peasants are educated now and are in revolt.\"\n\nMr Rees-Mogg lives in the next village with his heiress wife Helena de Chair, three sons and a daughter, but is a regular visitor to the hamlet where he grew up.\n\nLocals met at the Ring O\u2018Bells to discuss the application, which is outside the settlement boundary of the village, and has a church, village hall and just one bus service a week.\n\nThe area is not green belt land but is next to a Nature Conservation Area and the site includes the Cam Brook, which is a special landscape designation.\n\nHer Ladyship's planning consultants told villagers, in a newsletter, that she will discuss financial contributions towards improvements to highways and education or broadband if she gets planning permission.\n\nBut one objector, Joanna Burgess, told the council: \"All planning is political and politically it would be convenient for BANES to grant permission for this development to help meet its housing targets, but for the residents of the village the application represents a money-making exercise by the owner of the land at the expense of the aspirations of others.\"\n\nMr Rees-Mogg said: \"Planning is a matter for the local council and is not something that an MP has any say over.\n\n\"However, the green belt is a national policy designation which I strongly support and would oppose developments that threaten it.\"\n\nLady Gillian, who is now believed to live in Pall Mall, central London, could not be reached for comment yesterday.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A TORY MP is under fire after his aristocratic mother revealed plans to build a housing estate - in the middle of his upmarket family seat in the Chew Valley.\nResidents claim Lady Gillian Rees-Mogg is...", "og": {"site_name": "Bristol Post", "description": "A TORY MP is under fire after his aristocratic mother revealed plans to build a housing estate - in the middle of his upmarket family seat in the Chew Valley.\nResidents claim Lady Gillian Rees-Mogg is...", "language": "en", "title": "MP Rees-Mogg under fire over mother's plans for beauty spot housing estate", "url": "http://www.bristolpost.co.uk/MP-Rees-Mogg-mother-s-plans-beauty-spot-housing/story-20402090-detail/story.html", "image": "http://www.bristolpost.co.uk/images/localworld/ugc-images/276268/Article/images/20402090/5681092.jpg", "type": "article", "section": "UK news"}, "twitter": {"description": "A TORY MP is under fire after his aristocratic mother revealed plans to build a housing estate - in the middle of his upmarket family seat in the Chew Valley.\nResidents claim Lady Gillian Rees-Mogg is...", "title": "MP Rees-Mogg under fire over mother's plans for beauty spot housing estate", "url": "http://www.bristolpost.co.uk/MP-Rees-Mogg-mother-s-plans-beauty-spot-housing/story-20402090-detail/story.html", "image": "http://www.bristolpost.co.uk/images/localworld/ugc-images/276268/Article/images/20402090/5681092.jpg", "site": "BristolPost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "DC.date.issued": "2014-01-05", "site": {"domain": "http://www.bristolpost.co.uk"}, "fb": {"admins": "627876018,720666011,1064606560,100000421938678", "app_id": 649500528530167}, "msvalidate.01": "C1FC943041AC66B017981683C4A59C1E", "article": {"tag": "Bristol Post", "published_time": "2014-01-05T16:56:17+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-01-08T11:54:52+00:00", "author": "http://www.bristolpost.co.ukhttp://www.bristolpost.co.uk/people/The Bristol Post/profile.html"}, "y_key": "375f1bbd5088049b", "decorator": "newspaper-standard"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd99e\"", "article_summary": "Mr Rees-Mogg said: \"Planning is a matter for the local council and is not something that an MP has any say over.\nThe village is seen as the 'seat' of the Rees-Mogg family after Jacob's father William took the title of Baron Rees-Mogg, of Hinton Blewett, when he was made a peer in 1988.\nThe proposed development is close to the Mendip Hills Area of Natural Beauty and only 40 yards from a conservation area.\nFurious residents in Hinton Blewett say the application will increase the size of the village by more than a fifth.\nA TORY MP is under fire after his aristocratic mother revealed plans to build a housing estate - in the middle of his upmarket family seat in the Chew Valley."}
