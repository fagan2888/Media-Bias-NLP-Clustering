Doctors open the uterus and partially deliver the baby (out to the belly button) through the incision, while the baby remains attached to the placenta.\n\nThe attachment to the placenta\u2014serving as a lifeline\u2014ensures the baby will continue to get oxygen and nutrients from its mother while surgeons establish an airway that will allow the baby to breathe on its own.\n\nOnce the EXIT is complete, the umbilical cord is clamped then cut and the infant is fully delivered, with the rest of the process unfolding like a normal C-section delivery.\n\nWhile an EXIT procedure can include the risk of uterine bleeding and is considered much more complex and challenging than a standard C-section, the technique can provide yet another chance at life for a baby once doomed to death.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sometimes, a baby\u2019s condition requires a special surgical procedure, known as EXIT, performed while a baby is partially being born.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Sometimes, a baby\u2019s condition requires a special surgical procedure, known as EXIT, performed while a baby is partially being born.", "title": "Another Chance at Life: How Doctors Can Fix a Birth Defect During Delivery", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/484295341.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-01-21T15:31:43+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1GmY1xm"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Sometimes, a baby\u2019s condition requires a special surgical procedure, known as EXIT, performed while a baby is partially being born.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/484295341.jpg"}, "title": "Another Chance at Life: How Doctors Can Fix a Birth Defect During Delivery", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "fetal surgery", "published_time": "2015-01-22T03:01:05+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-21T15:31:43+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "fetal surgery, Michael Harrison, Scott Adzick, life pioneers, EXIT procedure, Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia, C-section"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdffbb\"", "article_summary": "In these rare cases, doctors use a specialized surgical delivery method called the EXIT procedure (ex utero intrapartum treatment) to deliver babies suffering from airway compression.\nA baby that has already had fetal surgery while still in its mother\u2019s womb does not require an EXIT procedure.\nAn EXIT procedure is done in anticipation that the baby will have an immediate, critical problem once separated from the mother at delivery.\nDoctors open the uterus and partially deliver the baby (out to the belly button) through the incision, while the baby remains attached to the placenta.\nIn our \u201cLife Pioneers\u201d series, The Daily Signal reported on the miracle of fixing birth defects before birth\u2014a lifesaving technique known as fetal surgery."}
