KNOX, Maine — A local man who allegedly urinated on his girlfriend’s clothes during a fight was arrested very early Sunday morning and charged with criminal mischief and domestic violence assault.

The girlfriend of 33-year-old Damien L. Ingraham called police at 1:18 a.m. Sunday to report that she had been assaulted by him, according to a police report from the Waldo County Sheriff’s Office.

The duo had been drinking, and she went to bed before him, Chief Deputy Jeff Trafton said Monday afternoon.

“At some point, he came in [to the bedroom]. He urinated in the closet and soaked some of her clothes. That upset her,” Trafton said.

Ingraham is alleged to have assaulted her, leaving bruises on her arm, and to have broken a closet door.

He was taken to Waldo County Jail in Belfast to be booked, and has been released on $100 cash bail, according to a jail official.
