Park officials say visitors will be randomly selected to secondary screenings.

Visitors to Disney theme parks in California and Florida will notice tighter security and some new rules. The park is stepping up in a big way to keep everyone safe.

White tents now take up space at Disney World entrances with metal detectors inside. Park officials say visitors will be randomly selected to secondary screenings. Several major league sports and entertainment venues already do this.

Disney has also added "visible" and "non-visible" security measures. Those include uniformed officers and specially trained dogs.

Once inside the parks, guests will no longer see toy guns or even water pistols. Those are being removed from Disney stores and visitors will not be allowed to bring them into the parks. Officials do not want fake guns to become distractions or cause confusion.

Another change, anyone 14 years and older can no longer wear costumes. This helps to move along the screening process.

Disney is not the only place making these changes. SeaWorld and Universal are taking similar precautions.
