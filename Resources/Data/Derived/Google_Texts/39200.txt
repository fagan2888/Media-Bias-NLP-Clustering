A new bill would exempt schools from the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act’s employer mandate.

Introduced by Rep. Luke Messer, R-Ind., the bill — called Safeguarding Classrooms Hurt by Obamacare’s Obligatory Levies Act — would exempt K-12 schools, institutions of higher education, and state and local education agencies from the mandate. Messer rolled it out late last week.
