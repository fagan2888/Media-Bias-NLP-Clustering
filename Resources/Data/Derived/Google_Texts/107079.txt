Appearing on Up with Steve Kornacki Sunday morning, Sen. Angus King (I-Maine) completely eviscerated Vice President Dick Cheney for comments he made about the CIA’s use of torture.

Last week, before any information from the Senate Intelligence Committee’s report went public, Cheney appeared on a college television station to defend the Bush administration’s “enhanced interrogation program.” “Some people call it torture,” Cheney said. “It wasn’t torture. We were very careful in all respects to abide by the law.”

King called the executive summary “shocking,” and said he was “stunned” to hear Cheney’s comments to the contrary.
