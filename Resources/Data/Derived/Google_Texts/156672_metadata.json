Bush has taken pains not to insert himself into the events of the day. Not to weigh in. Not to utter statements bound to become headlines.\n\nWhen he breaks that habit, you perk up and wonder why.\n\nHe broke it in regard to Ted Cruz.\n\nAccording to a report in Politico on Monday, Bush used his unscripted remarks at a fund-raiser for his brother Jeb over the weekend to make clear that among Jeb\u2019s rivals for the Republican nomination, one in particular rubs him the wrong way.\n\nHe described Cruz as cynically opportunistic and self-serving. And this assessment was so starkly at odds with Bush\u2019s anodyne, even warm, remarks about other Republican presidential candidates that listeners were stunned, wrote Politico\u2019s Eli Stokols.\n\nBush reportedly summed up his sentiments about Cruz, who worked as a policy adviser on Bush\u2019s 2000 presidential campaign, with this blunt declaration: \u201cI just don\u2019t like the guy.\u201d\n\nI think a great many Americans \u2014 including a majority of Cruz\u2019s colleagues in Congress \u2014 know exactly how he feels.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut there\u2019s no solace in his words. Quite the opposite. He wouldn\u2019t have felt compelled to utter them if Cruz wasn\u2019t a possible factor in the race \u2014 if he wasn\u2019t a menacing, stalking, relentless force to watch for and run from, like the body-hopping spirit in this year\u2019s most celebrated horror movie, \u201cIt Follows.\u201d\n\nIn fact Bush\u2019s remarks at the fund-raiser apparently included a heads-up about Cruz\u2019s potency, especially in primaries across the South.\n\nThe slow torture of the Republican primary knows no limit. First Donald Trump turns it into a carnival, then Ben Carson comes along with his insanity about the Holocaust and guns. Between them they own nearly 50 percent of the Republican vote, according to recent national surveys.\n\nExamine those polls closely and your stomach clenches tighter. Cruz is \u201cfourth in an average of the last three live-interview polls, at 8 percent,\u201d wrote Harry Enten late last week on the website FiveThirtyEight. In a subsequent NBC/Wall Street Journal poll, Cruz was again fourth, a few points behind Rubio and a point ahead of Bush.\n\nIt follows.\n\nHis campaign has more cash on hand than that of any other Republican in the hunt. If you add \u201csuper PAC\u201d money that\u2019s been officially disclosed so far to the tally, he trails only Jeb and Hillary Clinton.\n\nIt follows.\n\nIn a column earlier this month, I noted that alarmed Republican operatives were paying greater heed to Cruz, who seems to be positioning himself as the ultraconservative fallback \u2014 the rabble rouser in the bullpen \u2014 if angry voters rethink Trump or Carson and want an establishment-vilifying candidate with at least some government experience. Cruz is in his first term as a senator from Texas.\n\nAnd what a first term it\u2019s been, beginning with his insinuations that Chuck Hagel was a traitor, continuing through his preening \u201cGreen Eggs and Ham\u201d quasi-filibuster, cresting with his public denunciation of the Republican Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, as a liar and culminating with his call for a government shutdown to prevent any federal funding of Planned Parenthood, a replay of his call for a government shutdown to do away with Obamacare.\n\nHe\u2019s the patron saint of lost causes, at least if they bring the spotlight his way. In that sense he\u2019s emblematic of the flamboyantly uncompromising comrades in the so-called Freedom Caucus in the House of Representatives, who similarly confuse attention with accomplishment.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAll of them, with Cruz as their spiritual leader, have turned petulance into a theory of governing, or rather anti-governing, as they breezily disregard the contradiction of their ravenous lunge to become monarchs of a kingdom that they supposedly want to topple, to gain power over a system that they ostensibly intend to enfeeble.\n\nCruz doesn\u2019t propose remedies. He performs rants. He\u2019s not interested in collaboration or teamwork. His main use for other politicians, even in his party, is as foils and targets. Paul Ryan got a taste of that over the weekend, when Cruz, on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d was asked if Ryan was a true conservative and dodged the question, withholding his blessing.\n\nHe should be careful about genuineness versus phoniness, given the problems with his own prairie-populist pose.\n\nCruz\u2019s law degree is from Harvard and he did his undergraduate work at Princeton, where the 250-year-old debating club that he belonged to is called the American Whig-Cliosophic Society. Cruz\u2019s wife is on leave from a job with Goldman Sachs.\n\nKeep that in mind when he rails against the establishment and the elites. And remember that when someone is as broadly and profoundly disliked as Cruz is, it\u2019s usually not because he\u2019s a principled truth teller.\n\nIt\u2019s because he\u2019s frightening.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "opinion", "ptime": 20151021032103, "twitter": {"description": "The Texas senator lurks ever larger in the 2016 presidential race, which grows scarier by the week.", "title": "The Scary Specter of Ted Cruz", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/21/opinion/the-scary-specter-of-ted-cruz.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003988517"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "creator": "FrankBruni", "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/01/opinion/bruni-circular/bruni-circular-thumbLarge-v7.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/21/opinion/the-scary-specter-of-ted-cruz.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003988517", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/21/opinion/the-scary-specter-of-ted-cruz.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion", "hdl_p": "The Scary Specter of Ted Cruz", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Oct. 21, 2015", "edt": "NewYork", "org": "Republican Party", "keywords": "Presidential Election of 2016,Cruz  Ted,Republican Party,Bush  George W,United States Politics and Government", "CN": "frank-bruni", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Frank Bruni", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/01/opinion/bruni-circular/bruni-circular-thumbLarge-v7.jpg", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "per": "Bush, George W", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "byl": "By FRANK BRUNI", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "The Texas senator lurks ever larger in the 2016 presidential race, which grows scarier by the week.", "tom": "Op-Ed", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "CT": "column", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/01/opinion/bruni-circular/bruni-circular-thumbStandard-v5.jpg", "description": "The Texas senator lurks ever larger in the 2016 presidential race, which grows scarier by the week.", "CG": "opinion", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Oct. 21, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "Op-Ed", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/b/frank_bruni/index.html", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/opinion/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "modified": "2015-10-22", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "United States Politics and Government", "published": "2015-10-21", "section-taxonomy-id": "AD8090D7-4137-4D71-84C8-70DA3BD89778"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "slug": "21bruni", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20151022111101, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/21/opinion/the-scary-specter-of-ted-cruz.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/01/opinion/bruni-circular/bruni-circular-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The Texas senator lurks ever larger in the 2016 presidential race, which grows scarier by the week.", "title": "The Scary Specter of Ted Cruz"}, "pdate": 20151021, "des": "United States Politics and Government", "nyt-collection": {"tone": "opinion", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/column/frank-bruni", "tagline": "Politics, social issues, education and culture.", "uri": "/column/frank-bruni", "display-name": "Frank Bruni", "identifier": "frank-bruni", "type": "column"}, "articleid": 100000003988517, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "The Scary Specter of Ted Cruz", "col": "Op-Ed Columnist", "PST": "Op-Ed"}, "article_summary": "He broke it in regard to Ted Cruz.\nAnd remember that when someone is as broadly and profoundly disliked as Cruz is, it\u2019s usually not because he\u2019s a principled truth teller.\nIn a subsequent NBC/Wall Street Journal poll, Cruz was again fourth, a few points behind Rubio and a point ahead of Bush.\nCruz is \u201cfourth in an average of the last three live-interview polls, at 8 percent,\u201d wrote Harry Enten late last week on the website FiveThirtyEight.\nHe described Cruz as cynically opportunistic and self-serving."}
