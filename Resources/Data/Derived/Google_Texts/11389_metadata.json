Nature's pandora box. As illustrated by the above video from AsapSCIENCE, while the specific fashion and entertainment choices of teens might be inscrutable, there are plenty of biological explanations for their general personality quirks \u2014 namely their recklessness and moodiness.\n\nFor one, teen brains are still maturing, particularly the areas known to be associated with impulse control and risk assessment. The flood of sex hormones that help fuel the process of puberty, testosterone and estrogen, also prime teenagers to seek out and be especially responsive to emotional triggers. The latter may partially explain their rabid adoration of love ballads, boy bands, and thrill-seeking activities.\n\nLikely more than anything else, though, it\u2019s the need for social acceptance that drives teens' wayward plunges into unsafe and risky behavior \u2014 stick a teenager behind the wheel of a car with their friends and they\u2019ll be less cautious than they would be otherwise. And while no one likes being unpopular, teens are especially crushed by the prospect, both mentally and physically. Last but not least, the fact that teens' internal clocks are especially thrown out of whack might explain their propensity to pick up bad sleeping habits. As is the case with adults, their love of smartphones might contribute to that as well.\n\nThere is some good news. Since teens have greater social awareness, it motivates them to meet new people. Their quickly growing brains are able to make new neural connections and retain information to a degree any fuddy duddy adults would totes be jealous of.\n\nIn other words, despite your local brat's protestations, it\u2019s not the end of the world being a teenager.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "teen, mood, swings, love, one, direction, associated, brain, development", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "AsapSCIENCE gets to the bottom of teenage mood swings.", "title": "Teen Angst, Explained", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/teen-mood-swings-brain-development-373568", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2016/02/14/teen-mood-swings-love-one-direction-associated-brain-development.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "AsapSCIENCE gets to the bottom of teenage mood swings.", "title": "Teen Angst, Explained", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/teen-mood-swings-brain-development-373568", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2016/02/14/teen-mood-swings-love-one-direction-associated-brain-development.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2016/02/14/teen-mood-swings-love-one-direction-associated-brain-development.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Vitality", "published_time": "2016-02-14T17:42:25-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-14T17:42:23-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "AsapSCIENCE gets to the bottom of teenage mood swings."}, "article_summary": "For one, teen brains are still maturing, particularly the areas known to be associated with impulse control and risk assessment.\nAs is the case with adults, their love of smartphones might contribute to that as well.\nAnd while no one likes being unpopular, teens are especially crushed by the prospect, both mentally and physically.\nIn other words, despite your local brat's protestations, it\u2019s not the end of the world being a teenager.\nThe latter may partially explain their rabid adoration of love ballads, boy bands, and thrill-seeking activities."}
