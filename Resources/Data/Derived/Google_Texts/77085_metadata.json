Tim Ryan also accused those who oppose sex education in the public schools, employer-subsidized birth control through ObamaCare, and expanding social welfare programs of \u201cignorance, fear, and \u2013 yes \u2013 discrimination against women.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was elected to political office at a young age, and being raised in a Catholic household, always considered myself pro-life,\u201d Ryan wrote in an op-ed entitled \u201cWhy I Changed My Thinking on Abortion,\u201d published in yesterday's Akron Beacon-Journal. \u201cToday, I am a 41-year-old father and husband whose feelings on this issue have changed.\u201d\n\nRyan later told the Cleveland Plain Dealer that his thinking \u201ccrystallized over the course of our own kid being born.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have come a long way since being a single, 26-year-old state senator, and I am not afraid to say that my position has evolved as my experiences have broadened, deepened, and become more personal,\u201d Ryan continued. \u201cI would be abandoning my own conscience and judgment if I held a position that I no longer believed appropriate.\u201d\n\nThe seven-term congressman said that speaking with post-abortive women \u201cgave me a better understanding of how complex and difficult certain situations can become,\u201d he wrote on Tuesday. While he and his wife \u201cwere fortunate enough to bring Brady into a prepared family full of love and devotion\u201d and he would \u201cwish that for every child and every family, I know it is not always the case.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have come to believe that we must trust women and families \u2014 not politicians \u2014 to make the best decision for their lives,\u201d he concluded. \u201cAnd while there are people of good conscience on both sides of this argument, one thing has become abundantly clear to me: the heavy hand of government must not make this decision for women and families.\u201d\n\nInstead, Ryan would like the government to \u201cplay a significant role\u201d in giving women and underage girls \u201cthe tools they need to prevent unintended pregnancies by expanding education and access to contraception.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe must get past the ignorance, fear and \u2014 yes \u2014 discrimination against women that lead to restrictions on contraception and age-appropriate sex education,\u201d Ryan wrote.\n\nThe Ohio Democrat, who is a devotee of Transcendental Meditation, added that his Roman Catholic formation helped convince him to embrace abortion. \u201cMy faith is important to me, and like many Catholics I strive to adhere to its principles, especially one of the essential and highest teachings of 'judge not, lest ye be judged,'\u201d Ryan wrote. \u201cI\u2019ve heard firsthand from women of all ages, races, and socioeconomic backgrounds about the circumstances and hardships that accompany this personal choice, which we should not judge.\u201d\n\nThomas Peters of the American Papist blog tweeted in response:\n\nNoticed @RepTimRyan immediately brought up his Catholic faith when justifying his proabortion views. Sad and ignorant! \u2014 Thomas Peters (@AmericanPapist) January 28, 2015\n\nPlanned Parenthood President Cecile Richards hailed Ryan's \u201chonesty and courage.\u201d\n\nRyan, whose northeast Ohio 13th U.S. House District includes Youngstown, is one of several Democrats who has expressed interest in running for U.S. Senate against incumbent Republican Rob Portman. While he has only $441,000 on hand, he told Roll Call that \u201cthe resources would be there,\u201d and that he had been \u201ccultivating relationships around the country for the past couple of years.\u201d\n\nRyan denied politics entered his decision today, saying, \u201cThe reality is, this is just where my heart is right now.\u201d\n\nBut his pro-life critics aren't buying it. \u201cCongressman Ryan\u2019s flip-flop on abortion clearly demonstrates his opportunistic and self-centered approach in seeking higher office,\u201d Mike Gonidakis, president of Ohio Right to Life, said in a statement first emailed to LifeSiteNews and later released to the wider media. \u201cBy callously and carelessly tossing aside his so-called strong Catholic upbringing and pro-life beliefs to now support abortion, sadly proves yet again that politicians will say anything and do anything to get elected or climb the political ladder. It is no wonder why Congress has the lowest approval rating in our nation\u2019s history.\u201d\n\nRyan compiled a largely pro-life voting record in the early years after entering Congress following the expulsion of the late Jim Traficant in 2002 \u2013 voting to ban partial birth abortion, forbid the use of tax dollars for abortion, stop the expansion of abortion on military bases, restrict transporting minors across state lines for abortions, bar human cloning, and to adopt the Unborn Victims of Violence Act. In 2004, Democrats for Life named Ryan one of its \"Democrats for Life All-Stars.\u201d (Attempts to reach Democrats for Life were not immediately returned.)\n\nHowever, he also voted to expand embryonic stem cell research. Most recently, he voted against the Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, which would limit abortion to the first 20 weeks of pregnancy. By 2009, his voting record caused him to be \"booted\" (his term) off the national advisory board of Democrats for Life and labeled by National Right to Life's Douglas Johnson as a \"pro-life impersonator.\"\n\n\u201cOf course, Ryan was proudly 'pro-life' while easily getting re-elected in an otherwise gerrymandered district,\u201d Gonidakis told LifeSiteNews. \u201cBut now as he seeks higher office, which we assume will be a challenge to pro-life Senator Rob Portman, he chooses to abandon those who helped him get elected in the first place.\u201d\n\n\u201cMost alarming to all Ohioans, both pro-life and pro-choice, is that if he is willing to easily flip-flop on the fundamental issue of a baby\u2019s life, what would he do with every other issue which faces our nation?\u201d Gonidakis asked.\n\nRyan is not the first Democrat to change his position on abortion when seeking national office. Bill Clinton, Al Gore, Jesse Jackson, and Richard Gephardt, among others, opposed abortion funding or denounced abortion itself at early stages of their political careers.\n\nHis new position could prove politically challenging, as a 2013 poll showed Ohioans splitting evenly in their support for the far more restrictive Heartbeat bill.\n\n\u201cCongressman Ryan\u2019s so-called conversion should be a wake-up call to voters in his current district, as well as the rest of Ohio, that he is nothing more than a political opportunist who will say anything to get elected,\u201d Gonidakis concluded.\n\n\u201cThankfully, Ohioans have rejected this type of politics and Congressman Ryan, I suspect, will soon learn of these consequences if he chooses to run for the U.S. Senate.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "LifeSiteNews", "description": "'If he is willing to easily flip-flop on the fundamental issue of a baby\u2019s life, what would he do with every other issue which faces our nation?' asked Ohio pro-life leader Mike Gonidakis.", "title": "\u2018Pro-life Democrat\u2019 Catholic Congressman Tim Ryan embraces abortion", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/lifesite/4866652362_d8f48b8b8c_o.jpg", "url": "https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/pro-life-democrat-catholic-congressman-tim-ryan-embraces-abortion", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "'If he is willing to easily flip-flop on the fundamental issue of a baby\u2019s life, what would he do with every other issue which faces our nation?' asked Ohio pro-life leader Mike Gonidakis."}, "description": "'If he is willing to easily flip-flop on the fundamental issue of a baby\u2019s life, what would he do with every other issue which faces our nation?' asked Ohio pro-life leader Mike Gonidakis.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "fb": {"admins": 1477213784, "app_id": 132010293551131, "pages": 112623813202}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde1c9\"", "article_summary": "In 2004, Democrats for Life named Ryan one of its \"Democrats for Life All-Stars.\u201d (Attempts to reach Democrats for Life were not immediately returned.)\nThe Ohio Democrat, who is a devotee of Transcendental Meditation, added that his Roman Catholic formation helped convince him to embrace abortion.\nRyan is not the first Democrat to change his position on abortion when seeking national office.\nNewsAbortion, Politics - U.S.A Congressman once described as a \u201cpro-life Democrat\u201d has embraced abortion, crediting the birth of his first child and his Catholic faith as two of the reasons for his change of heart.\n\u201cOf course, Ryan was proudly 'pro-life' while easily getting re-elected in an otherwise gerrymandered district,\u201d Gonidakis told LifeSiteNews."}
