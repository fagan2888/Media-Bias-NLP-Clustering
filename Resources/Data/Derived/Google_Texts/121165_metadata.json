The program collected $688.5 million from hospitals between October 2014 and September 2015, The Denver Post reported, and it is projected to raise approximately $750 million during Colorado\u2019s 2016\u201317 fiscal year.\n\nOrdinarily, that would trigger a taxpayer refund under a state constitutional provision called the Taxpayer\u2019s Bill of Rights (TABOR). TABOR requires all tax increases to be approved by voters, and it requires Colorado officials to refund to taxpayers any revenue in excess of population growth plus inflation\u2014with one exception.\n\nExperts Reject Loophole Argument\n\nA TABOR loophole exempts tax revenues designated for an \u201centerprise\u201d from the refund requirement. Gov. John Hickenlooper (D) has asked legislators to reclassify the Hospital Provider Fee Oversight and Advisory Board as an enterprise. Opponents say that would circumvent the state\u2019s constitution.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s this big move now to see how they can get around TABOR [and] how they can keep more of this money,\u201d said Michael Fields, state director of the Colorado chapter of Americans for Prosperity.\n\nLinda Gorman, director of the Health Care Policy Center at the Independence Institute, says reclassifying HPF funds would raise taxes on the sly.\n\n\u201cThis is just a sleight of hand by the legislature,\u201d Gorman said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t want to have a vote on it, because they knew they\u2019d lose.\u201d\n\nGorman was one of 12 members appointed in October 2015 to the Colorado Commission on Affordable Health Care.\n\n\u201cThe new designation would move almost $1 billion in tax disguised as fee revenue off the state budget,\u201d Gorman wrote in November 2015 in a Health Care Policy Center blog post. \u201cUnder TABOR restrictions, the state then could requisition and spend an additional $1 billion in taxes and fees from the private sector. As Colorado collected about $12.2 billion in total taxes and fees in FY 2014, this first \u2018solution\u2019 constitutes about an 8 percent raise for state bureaucracies.\u201d\n\nMore Receive than Give\n\nGorman says even without the loophole, HPF taxes hospitals unfairly. Twenty-two of the state\u2019s 99 hospitals do not pay the fee, yet about half receive funds from it, according to The Denver Post.\n\n\u201c[There\u2019s] a huge, untransparent redistribution taking place,\u201d Gorman said. \u201cAbout 10 hospitals have always had more money taken from them than they\u2019ve gotten back. The people in those areas are going to hospitals that normally are running a profit, but since the money\u2019s being pulled out, these people aren\u2019t getting the health care they paid for.\u201d\n\nGorman says the greatest myth is the fee is paid by hospitals.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s actually paid by individuals,\u201d Gorman said. \u201cThey get to keep my fee, and it\u2019s a big transfer to the state bureaucracy, because they expand their little empire.\u201d\n\n\u2018Linguistic Fiction\u2019\n\nFields and Gorman say the Colorado General Assembly should abide by the law and enact long-term budgetary reforms instead of spending the surpluses. Colorado\u2019s skyrocketing health care costs and public pension budget need attention, Fields says.\n\n\u201cIf TABOR forced us to talk about it, that\u2019s a good thing,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIn the meantime, they ought to start axing some of their favorite solar energy programs, stop building bike paths, and generally take a hard look at the state budget,\u201d said Gorman.\n\nGorman says taxpayers must defeat the attempt to evade popular tax-limitation measures through what she calls \u201clinguistic fiction.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have a lawless government [playing] games, and we can\u2019t let them get away with it,\u201d Gorman said. \u201cThen our tax limitation amendment means nothing.\u201d\n\nBen Johnson (therightswriter@gmail.com) writes from Stockport, Ohio.\n\nInternet Info:\n\nMatthew Glans, \u201cColorado\u2019s Hospital Provider Tax and TABOR Collide,\u201d Research & Commentary, The Heartland Institute, February 8, 2016: https://www.heartland.org/policy-documents/research-commentary-colorados-hospital-provider-tax-and-tabor-collide", "article_metadata": {}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2543\"", "article_summary": "Colorado legislators must decide whether to refund surplus hospital tax revenues to state taxpayers or reclassify a $1.2 billion fund in a way critics say skirts the state\u2019s constitution.\nInternet Info:Matthew Glans, \u201cColorado\u2019s Hospital Provider Tax and TABOR Collide,\u201d Research & Commentary, The Heartland Institute, February 8, 2016: https://www.heartland.org/policy-documents/research-commentary-colorados-hospital-provider-tax-and-tabor-collide\nOrdinarily, that would trigger a taxpayer refund under a state constitutional provision called the Taxpayer\u2019s Bill of Rights (TABOR).\nColorado\u2019s skyrocketing health care costs and public pension budget need attention, Fields says.\nLinda Gorman, director of the Health Care Policy Center at the Independence Institute, says reclassifying HPF funds would raise taxes on the sly."}
