It is the biggest foreign owner of U.S. securities, exerting a heavy influence on the long-term borrowing costs for U.S. government, consumers and businesses.\n\nBloomberg News\n\nChina\u2019s purchases of U.S. debt have been slowing down from a torrid pace over the decade through 2013. The world\u2019s second-largest economy is grappling with a slower pace of growth, a reduced pace of foreign reserve accumulation and capital outflows driven by the prospect of higher interest rates from the U.S. Federal Reserve.\n\nNow with China joining the global game of letting its currency soften to boost exports, logically more dollar receipts may find their way back to the U.S. bond market. If the yuan continues to weaken in coming months, analysts say this at least would boost China\u2019s demand for U.S. debt.\n\nHowever, analysts say the trend of slowing buying from China remains in place. Anticipation of a weaker yuan could spur more capital flows out of China, eroding the nation\u2019s foreign reserves, the world\u2019s biggest in size.\n\nThe risks \u201care skewed toward further capital outflows in coming months,\u201d said interest-rate analysts at J.P. Morgan Securities LLC in a note to clients. \u201cChinese demand for Treasury bonds has already been muted in 2015, and this suggests demand should remain tepid in coming months.\u201d\n\nChinese foreign exchange reserves have fallen by more than $300 billion from their peak in June 2014 to $3.651 trillion recently, a more than 8% decline over the period, according to J.P. Morgan. As a result, on a six-month rolling basis, Chinese Treasury purchases have slowed to just $10 billion, their slowest run rate since late 2013, according to J.P. Morgan.\n\n[RELATED: China Fears Spark Fresh Market Selloff. Here\u2019s What the Street Thinks.]\n\nEric Stein, co-director of global income at money manager Eaton Vance Management, said China is giving the markets a bigger role in deciding the value of the yuan, as part of the effort to groom the currency as global reserve currency. Less intervention in the currency markets means over a medium-term time frame, this probably reduces the need for China to recycle dollars into Treasury bonds, he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s tough to say how this will affect the Treasury bond market on a day-to-day basis, but one of the major changes for the bond market looking ahead will be less Chinese participation,\u201d said Mr. Stein.\n\nFew expect China to sell Treasury debt holdings in a significant way, a scenario that could send Treasury yields spiking, hurting not only the U.S. growth outlook and rattling global markets. Such a move would cause China\u2019s large holdings of Treasury debt to plunge in value.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "In the wake of China's surprising devaluation of its currency, strategists are facing a tough question: What could the move mean for China's demand for U.S. Treasurys?", "title": "What China\u2019s Devaluation Could Mean for Treasurys", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2015/08/12/what-chinas-devaluation-could-mean-for-treasurys/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-HP351_0326yu_G_20150326072527.jpg"}, "site": "WSJMoneyBeat", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Markets", "article.headline": "What China\u2019s Devaluation Could Mean for Treasurys", "description": "In the wake of China's surprising devaluation of its currency, strategists are facing a tough question: What could the move mean for China's demand for U.S. Treasurys?", "article_section": "Markets", "author": "Min Zeng", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "MoneyBeat Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "MoneyBeat", "article.summary": "In the wake of China's surprising devaluation of its currency, strategists are facing a tough question: What could the move mean for China's demand for U.S. Treasurys?", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2015-08-12T16:26:55-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-138", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2015/08/12/what-chinas-devaluation-could-mean-for-treasurys/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-MBB-40353", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Markets", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "In the wake of China's surprising devaluation of its currency, strategists are facing a tough question: What could the move mean for China's demand for U.S. Treasurys?", "title": "What China\u2019s Devaluation Could Mean for Treasurys", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2015/08/12/what-chinas-devaluation-could-mean-for-treasurys/", "image": {"width": 553, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-HP351_0326yu_G_20150326072527.jpg", "height": 369}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "MoneyBeat", "article.id": "BL-MBB-40353", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2015-08-12T20:13:19-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe25fc\"", "article_summary": "In the wake of China\u2019s surprising devaluation of its currency, strategists are facing a tough question: What could the move mean for China\u2019s demand for U.S. Treasurys?\nSuch a move would cause China\u2019s large holdings of Treasury debt to plunge in value.\nIf the yuan continues to weaken in coming months, analysts say this at least would boost China\u2019s demand for U.S. debt.\nChina held about $1.27 trillion U.S. government debt in May, according to the latest data from the Treasury.\nFew expect China to sell Treasury debt holdings in a significant way, a scenario that could send Treasury yields spiking, hurting not only the U.S. growth outlook and rattling global markets."}
