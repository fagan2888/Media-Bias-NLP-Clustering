Susana Martinez has sparked protests from some educators and unions accusing Martinez and the Public Education Department of being anti-teacher but Martinez defended her reform measures, telling New Mexico Watchdog, \u201cI\u2019m so pro-teacher it\u2019s not even funny.\u201d\n\nThe Republican governor and PED Secretary-designate Hanna Skandera are calling for a new assessment program that calls for up to 50 percent of a teacher\u2019s evaluation to come from student achievement testing.\n\nThat has led to fierce pushback from opponents who say there\u2019s too much emphasis on testing and allege Martinez and Skandera are unfairly targeting teachers.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so pro-teacher because I want to reward that profession as it should be rewarded,\u201d Martinez said Wednesday after giving a speech in Albuquerque. \u201cI don\u2019t want an excellent teacher or school leader to be treated the very same as a teacher who walks into the classroom and merely says, \u2018Read chapter 12 and leave when the bell rings.\u2019 \u201d\n\nBut on Oct. 22 in Albuquerque, a rally was held denouncing the teacher evaluation system and Martinez-backed reforms.\n\nAnd on Wednesday night in Las Cruces, a school board meeting centered on the evaluations as well as a requirement that would penalize teachers for missing too many days of work. Right now, teachers in Las Cruces are given 10 sick days per year under their contract with the school district.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know when teachers became public enemy No. 1,\u201d Mary Parr-Sanchez, a Picacho Middle School teacher and vice president of the state NEA teacher\u2019s union branch, told the Las Cruces Sun-News. \u201cIt feels that way sometimes.\u201d\n\nAt the Albuquerque rally, a number of anti-Martinez and anti-Skandera signs were on display, including one that portrayed the governor and PED secretary-designate with bloody fangs.\n\nStand4Kids NM, a group critical of Martinez and Skandera, has established a Facebook page with more than 3,000 \u201clikes\u201d and the American Federation of Teachers, AFL-CIO New Mexico union has filed a lawsuit against the evaluation plan.\n\n\u201cOur kids are crying because they don\u2019t want to be in school, they\u2019re tested to death,\u201d Alamosa Elementary School fifth-grade teacher Pamela Irvin told the Albuquerque Journal last month.\n\nWhen asked why there\u2019s been so much opposition, Martinez said, \u201cI think it\u2019s because the information about what we plan on doing in allowing to raise those teachers up and raise their profession isn\u2019t getting out all the way down to the teachers themselves. That\u2019s why we\u2019re improving on our communication because we want them to know.\u201d\n\nOpponents have argued that Martinez and Skandera haven\u2019t listened to their concerns and since neither of them have classroom experience, the governor and secretary-designate don\u2019t understand what educators face each day.\n\nMartinez supporters include an Albuquerque charter school, Albuquerque Institute for Mathematics and Science. whose principal attributes a more robust teacher evaluation program with dramatic increases in reading and math.\n\nMartinez believes a better evaluation system should take the place of an assessment system that has seen nearly every New Mexico teacher deemed as competent, while student reading scores and drop-out rates consistently rank 48th and 49th in the country.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s really important to separate our really good teachers,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cWe want to reward them. You can\u2019t have 99 percent (deemed) effective teachers and \u2014 when I first took office \u2014 63 percent graduation rates. You can see that the math doesn\u2019t match up. So we have to assess teachers based on student performance and progress. There has to be a link.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s NM Watchdog video of Martinez defending her education measures:\n\nContact Rob Nikolewski at rnikolewski@watchdog.org and follow him on Twitter @robnikolewski", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "By Rob Nikolewski \u2502 New Mexico Watchdog SANTA FE \u2014 A teacher evaluation plan promoted by Gov.
