I got more Democrats for me,\u201d he quipped on Saturday.\n\nFollow along below for live updates:\n\n8:02 pm ET: Rupert\u2019s words. Media mogul Rupert Murdoch weighed in on Twitter about what he thinks of Hillary Clinton\u2019s prospects. \u201cDo Obama\u2019s really want Hillary to win?\u201d he asked, a bit provocatively. At her debate with Bernie Sanders on Thursday, Clinton was asked about the speeches she gave to Goldman Sachs employees, for which was paid more than $600,000. Clinton said she would look into whether she would release transcripts of those speeches.\n\n\u201cOf course Hillary\u2019s agent sought top dollar fees. Why lie? What she told Wall St. friends IS relevant and we will never be told,\u201d Murdoch tweeted, trying to give a bit more fuel to the storyline.\n\n8:16 pm ET: Missing the cue. OK, this is a comedy of errors. Ben Carson was called to the stage, then missed his cue. He just stood there. Then Trump appeared to be waiting for him to go out on stage. And then the moderators missed calling out John Kasich. Oh well, they are all on the stage now.\n\n8:29 pm ET: What happened in Iowa? One of the first questions is about Cruz\u2019s campaign tactics in Iowa. Trump has charged that Cruz \u201cstole\u201d the election, pointing to his campaign\u2019s distribution of messages to caucus goers, just before voting was to begin, that Carson was dropping out of the race. In fact, Carson\u2019s campaign merely released an announcement that he would be taking a break to Florida, not dropping out. Cruz apologizes, and blames it on CNN\u2019s reporting. But Carson notes that CNN quickly clarified its report.\n\n\u201cI will not use this opportunity to savage the reputation of Sen. Cruz,\u201d Carson says, before noting how ridiculous it would be for him to drop out of the caucuses just as voting was starting.\n\n8:38 pm ET: Christie goes after Rubio. Christie slams Rubio, including Rubio\u2019s attendance record in the Senate. \u201cThat is not leadership, that is truancy,\u201d Christie says. Rubio tries to keep his focus on President Obama, but he can\u2019t avoid a few shots at Christie in response.\n\n\u201cChris your state got hit by a massive snowstorm two weeks ago, you didn\u2019t even want to go back. You had to be shamed into going back,\u201d Rubio responds.\n\nThen it gets even more bitter. \u201cThe shame is that you would actually criticize someone for showing up for work \u2026 When you have never been responsible in your entire life,\u201d Christie says.\n\nCarson brought up Ronald Reagan\u2019s \u201c11th commandment\u201d earlier in the evening. That was that Republicans shouldn\u2019t attack fellow Republicans. So much for that this cycle.\n\n8:46 pm ET: North Korea missile test. The candidates are asked about reports this evening that North Korea has tested an intercontinental ballistic missile \u2014 a breaking news development primed for query as a test of the candidates\u2019 readiness on foreign affairs. Trump\u2019s response is to first go into campaign rhetoric \u2014 \u201cour country is going to hell\u201d \u2014 but then he says that pressure has to be put on China to control the North Koreans. Rubio says Trump is right. \u201cIf a preemptive strike is needed to keep us safe, then we should do it,\u201d Bush says.\n\n8:55 pm ET: Christie vs. Rubio, II. An immigration question provides Christie with another chance to attack Rubio, who once co-sponsored legislation to provide a path to legalization status. But Rubio does not support that plan any longer.\n\n\u201cThe question is, did he fight for his legislation. It is abundantly clear that he didn\u2019t,\u201d Christie says.\n\nBut Rubio said that \u201cleadership is ultimately about solving the problem.\u201d He said that the legislation was the approach that was tried\u201d but didn\u2019t have a chance of passage. \u201cIt has been discussed for 30 years and nothing happens,\u201d he says.\n\n9:07 pm ET: The Donald and single payer. Is Trump in alignment with Bernie Sanders in wanting single-payer healthcare? He says that he will replace Obamacare \u201cwith something so much better,\u201d before slamming the program because insurance companies \u201care getting rich.\u201d He doesn\u2019t go into specifics on what he would offer, but he indicated that he would make a plan \u201cwhere people compete so much better,\u201d and praises health care savings plans. But he seems to suggest that other candidates are heartless in not recognizing the importance of getting people covered. \u201cWe are going to take care of people who are dying on the street,\u201d he sayd.\n\n9:14 pm ET: Eminent domain. Trump defends eminent domain as a necessity to build big public works projects and private infrastructure, giving Bush a chance to accuse him of attempting to use public domain to take an old woman\u2019s home for a casino in Atlantic City. \u201cTo turn this into a limousine parking lot for casinos is not a public use,\u201d Bush says. Trump says he didn\u2019t take the property, but is rattled by Bush\u2019s attack, at one point telling him to be \u201cquiet.\u201d That elicits boos from the crowd. \u201cThat is all his donors and special interests out there,\u201d Trump says.\n\n9:19 pm ET: Rubio on Obama. Rubio\u2019s campaign clearly has a strategy in turning answers, whenever possible, to President Obama. \u201cThis is a president who is trying to change this country,\u201d Rubio says, suggesting that it\u2019s a transformation that must be stopped. He goes to this talking point even when asked to respond to attacks from Christie, who has three times hit Rubio with harsh criticism.\n\n9:31 pm ET: Bombing ISIS. Many of the GOP candidates have bashed the Obama administration for not recognizing the threat of ISIS, but they stop short of committing U.S. ground troops. \u201cISIS is not just a Jihadist group. They\u2019re an apocalyptic group,\u201d he says. But given that threat, co-moderator Martha Raddatz presses Rubio on what he would do differently from what is being done now. Rubio says that while Sunni fighters have to be enlisted to retake ISIS territory, \u201cthe problem is they don\u2019t trust this administration.\u201d Trump says that the key is to take oil fields controlled by ISIS. Message: \u201cYou have got to knock the hell out of the oil.\u201d\n\n9:42 pm ET: Waterboarding. Cruz says that he does not consider waterboarding to meet \u201cthe gengeralized definition of torture,\u201d but says that he would not put it into widespread use. Trump has no nuance. \u201cI\u2019d bring back a hell of a lot worse than waterboarding,\u201d he says.\n\n9:51 pm ET: Addiction. Cruz gets into a very personal moment when talking about drug addiction, talking about his late half-sister\u2019s struggles. \u201cThis is an absolute epidemic. We need to solve it,\u201d he says, and then ties it to the need to secure the border to prevent drug trafficking from Mexican drug cartels. One of the campaign season\u2019s top viral videos was a Huffington Post spot of Christie talking about addiction. \u201cThis is a disease. It is not a moral failing. We need to get everyone the treatment that they need,\u201d Christie says. Their answers on the need for treatment are similar to those of Clinton and Sanders.\n\n10:05 pm ET: Excessive force. Trump defends the police when talking about law enforcement use of excessive force, which has helped spark the Black Lives Matter movement. \u201cWe have to give them more respect. They can\u2019t act. They are afraid of losing their pension and their job, and they don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d he says. When asked what victims or families of police shooting victims should do, Trump says, \u201cthey sue. Everybody sues.\u201d\n\nKasich says that he has set up a collaborative of community and law enforcement leaders to come up with a plan, calling it a \u201cwin-win.\u201d\n\n10:17 pm ET: Rubio, rinse, repeat. Someone has set up a Twitter account, @rubioglitch, with some variation on Rubio\u2019s talking point this evening. \u201cAs I was saying, this notion Obama doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing is pure fiction. He knows exactly what he is doing.\u201d\n\n10:25 pm ET: CNN strikes back. CNN put out a statement challenging Cruz\u2019s assertion that his campaign relied on its reporting in spreading the message that Carson was dropping out of the race. The network called what Cruz said \u201ccategorically false.\u201d \u201cCNN never corrected its reporting because it never had anything to correct. The Cruz campaign\u2019s actions the night of the Iowa caucuses had nothing to do with CNN\u2019s reporting. The fact that Senator Cruz continues to knowingly mislead the voters about this is astonishing.\u201d\n\n10:35 pm ET: That\u2019s it. This was a good night for the governors \u2014 Kasich, Bush and Christie probably benefited from the exposure, with fewer candidates on the stage, at the very time that they need it. Trump toned down his insults and stuck to his campaign slogans, but had to fend off a rather effective attack from Bush on his support for eminent domain. Cruz wasn\u2019t as much of a factor as the last debate, a reflection of his weaker position in New Hampshire, but was at his best in talking about his half-sister and addiction. Rubio struggled to respond to Christie\u2019s attacks, resorting too often to anti-Obama talking points (enough to provoke mocking on Twitter). Carson offered some levity for the evening, especially when he said, \u201cI\u2019m not here just to add beauty to the stage.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "Variety", "twitter": {"description": "Perhaps no other GOP debate this cycle has higher stakes than the New Hampshire debate on Saturday, sponsored by ABC News.", "title": "GOP New Hampshire Debate: Live Blog", "image": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/nup_171420_2766.jpg", "creator": "@tedstew", "site": "@variety", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "HandheldFriendly": "True", "published_at": "2016-02-06 16:59:20", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://variety.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/8181b523e3c891bc770494a0bbbe8244?s=16", "news_keywords": "ABC Republican debatedebate, Donald Trump, Jeb Bush", "generator": "WordPress.com", "author": "Ted Johnson", "image": "http://i2.wp.com/pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/nup_171420_2766.jpg?crop=99px%2C41px%2C773px%2C430px&resize=146%2C82&ssl=1", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "comment_count": 5, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "appeared_in_print": "No", "topics": "News", "body": "Perhaps no other GOP debate this cycle has higher stakes than the New Hampshire debate on Saturday, sponsored by ABC News.\r\n\r\nIt is one of their last big chances for the candidates to make their case to New Hampshire voters, whose Tuesday vote will undoubtedly produce a shakeout of the still-large Republican field.\r\n\r\nDonald Trump, who skipped the pre-Iowa debate and came in second in the state, still holds a sizable lead among Republicans in New Hampshire, but he's facing a host of rivals who believe that he is vulnerable or his campaign lacks the organization to make those numbers hold up.\r\n\r\nMarco Rubio, who beat expectations in Iowa and is ascending in some polls, already is a target of rivals Jeb Bush and Chris Christie.\r\n\r\nJohn Kasich, meanwhile, has staked everything on New Hampshire, hoping to become the moderate-right alternative to Ted Cruz, Trump or even Rubio. \"I ought to be running in a Democratic primary.
