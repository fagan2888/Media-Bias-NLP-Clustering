That\u2019s up nine points from 24% when we first asked this question in February. Just over half (52%) disagree, down from 58% in the earlier survey. Fifteen percent (15%) are undecided. (To see survey question wording, click here.)\n\nPerhaps even more disturbing is that the voters who feel strongest about overriding the federal courts \u2013 Republicans and conservatives - are those who traditionally have been the most supportive of the Constitution and separation of powers. During the Obama years, however, these voters have become increasingly suspicious and even hostile toward the federal government.\n\nFifty percent (50%) of GOP voters now believe states should have the right to ignore federal court rulings, compared to just 22% of Democrats and 30% of voters not affiliated with either major party. Interestingly, this represents a noticeable rise in support among all three groups.\n\nFifty percent (50%) of conservative voters share this view, but just 27% of moderates and 15% of liberals agree.\n\nVoters are closely divided in their opinions of both of last week\u2019s major rulings. Negative views of the Supreme Court are at their highest level in nearly nine years of regular surveying. Positive opinions are also up to a less dramatic three-year high.\n\n(Want a free daily e-mail update? If it's in the news, it's in our polls). Rasmussen Reports updates are also available on Twitter or Facebook.\n\nThe survey of 1,000 Likely Voters was conducted on June 30-July 1, 2015 by Rasmussen Reports. The margin of sampling error is +/- 3 percentage points with a 95% level of confidence. Field work for all Rasmussen Reports surveys is conducted by Pulse Opinion Research, LLC. See methodology.\n\nEarlier this year, 26% of voters told Rasmussen Reports that President Obama should have the right to ignore federal court rulings if they are standing in the way of actions he feels are important for the country. Forty-three percent (43%) of Democrats shared this belief, while 81% of Republicans and 67% of unaffiliated voters disagreed.\n\nThe more a voter approves of Obama\u2019s performance, the more likely he or she is to say that states should not have the right to ignore the federal courts.\n\nHigher income voters are more likely to oppose letting states ignore federal court rulings than those who earn less.\n\nSupport for ignoring the federal courts is up among most demographic groups, however.\n\nMost voters have long believed that the Supreme Court justices have their own political agenda, and they still tend to feel that that agenda is more liberal than conservative.\n\nA plurality (47%) of voters continues to believe the federal government has too much influence over state governments, and 54% think states should have the right to opt out of federal government programs that they don\u2019t agree with. Even more (61%) think states should have the right to opt out of federally mandated programs if the federal government doesn\u2019t help pay for them.\n\nThe Declaration of Independence, the foundational document that Americans honor on the Fourth of July, says that governments derive their authority from the consent of the governed, but just 25% believe that to be true of the federal government today.\n\nOnly 20% now consider the federal government a protector of individual liberty. Sixty percent (60%) see the government as a threat to individual liberty instead.\n\nAdditional information from this survey and a full demographic breakdown are available to Platinum Members only.\n\nPlease sign up for the Rasmussen Reports daily e-mail update (it\u2019s free) or follow us on Twitter or Facebook.
