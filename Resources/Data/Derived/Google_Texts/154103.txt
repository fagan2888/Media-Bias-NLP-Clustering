A disabled woman said she is still in disbelief after a car plowed into the side of her apartment, knocking her off her bed and into the hallway, police said.

"I’m still in shock. I’m numb,” Mary Searles-Parada said.

The driver hit the gas pedal instead of the brake, according to authorities at the scene.

It happened at around 8 a.m. in the 1100 block of E. Mountain View Road.

Searles-Parada was in her bedroom at the time of the crash.

“I’m trying to get up from the foot of the bed after I heard the bang and found myself in the hall,” she said.

Her niece was also in the apartment at the time of the incident.

Police arrived and began inspecting the damage.

“They said it’s not structurally sound and we don’t know what they’re going to do with us because I have a wheelchair and she has a heart condition,” Searles-Parada said.

The driver of the vehicle was not hurt
