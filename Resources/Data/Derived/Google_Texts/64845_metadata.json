But shortly afterward, she said no new damage had been done to the surgically repaired knee and her plans for the Sochi Olympics were still intact.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t hurt myself more than I\u2019m already hurt,\u201d said Vonn, the reigning Olympic downhill champion. \u201cIt was a small compression, and it was fully loaded on the right ski and my knee just completely gave out. I tried to pressure the ski again and it gave out again. I had no chance of making that gate, unfortunately.\u201d\n\nWith boyfriend Tiger Woods watching from the bottom of the slope, Vonn skied out after her left ski came up in the air, putting all her weight on the troublesome right leg. The American was clearly distressed after pulling up and looked close to tears as she clutched her knee.\n\nVonn needed surgery in February to reconstruct two knee ligaments after a crash at the world championships, and then partially re-tore one of them in November.\n\nShe said she will give herself plenty of rest and expects to race again \u201cprobably sometime in January\u201d as she follows a lighter program before the Olympics.\n\n\u201cAs much as time as I can give myself to really get as strong as I can, like I said, one maybe two races before the Olympics. That\u2019s it,\u201d Vonn said. \u201cI\u2019m going to play it safe and race minimal races, so I can get the confidence and the timing and the feeling of racing again. I\u2019m really going to be safe and smart as I can.\u201d\n\nWoods accompanied Vonn to a World Cup race for the first time, standing in the finish area and watching the racers finish their runs.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s very supportive and it\u2019s very fun to have him. This is his first World Cup and I think he enjoyed it,\u201d Vonn said. \u201cI think he was a little bit more nervous because of my knee. He\u2019s worried about me, but he\u2019s happy to be here and I\u2019m happy to have him.\u201d\n\nSchedule permitting, she\u2019d like Woods to attend the races in Sochi.\n\n\u201cYeah. I love having him around and the more races he can come to the better,\u201d Vonn said. \u201cBut I\u2019m not racing that much this year, unfortunately, so you probably won\u2019t see both of us around very much.\u201d\n\nWith his hands stuffed in his pockets, golf\u2019s 14-time major champion waited for Vonn\u2019s run as the 19th starter.\n\nShortly after Vonn went out, Woods walked away from the finish area as camera crews scrambled to keep up with him.\n\n\u201cJust having someone supporting you, always makes me feel better,\u201d Vonn said. \u201cI didn\u2019t feel any pressure, I had two really good training runs and I felt really confident today, and I\u2019m just disappointed that my knee didn\u2019t hold up like I thought it would.\u201d\n\nMarianne Kaufmann-Abderhalden of Switzerland won the race for her first career victory, and was also delighted to see Woods there.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good for our sport,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s perfect when we have a lot of prominent people in the finish area.\u201d\n\nDefending overall champion Tina Maze, who finished second, was surprised when Woods showed up at Friday\u2019s pre-race draw.\n\n\u201cI noticed that everyone was taking pictures. Then I realized that Tiger was here,\u201d she said. \u201cIt didn\u2019t bring Lindsey much luck today. I feel sorry for her that she didn\u2019t finish, but I hope she will be back soon. I managed to speak to her, a few words in the finish area. I think in the sport people really respect each other and I have respect for both of them.\u201d\n\nVonn has five World Cup wins in Val d\u2019Isere and also won two golds at the 2009 world championships\u2014but those victories all came on two good knees.\n\nEarlier this month, the 29-year-old American raced for the first time in 10 months. Still, she was buoyant after finishing only 0.04 seconds behind Dominique Gisin of Switzerland in Thursday\u2019s second training run.\n\n\u201cThe thing is I have no ACL (anterior cruciate ligament). So unless I get surgery there\u2019s nothing really magical that I can do that\u2019s going to make it better,\u201d she said. \u201cI just can get my leg stronger, my muscle stronger and try and support it a little more. But that has a small impact. My knee is loose and it\u2019s not stable and that\u2019s the way it\u2019s going to be from here on out. I just have to get used to it.\u201d\n\nShe did not regret her decision to race at Val d\u2019Isere, one of the most technically demanding slopes on the circuit.\n\n\u201cI think Val d\u2019Isere was a good place for me to come back to. I\u2019m skiing well, so going forward I definitely have a lot more confidence,\u201d she said. \u201cMy goal is the Olympics, so I\u2019m not winning any World Cups this year, any titles. As long as I\u2019m skiing well and have confidence, that\u2019s all I really need.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Lindsey Vonn optimistic about Sochi despite new setback", "title": "Lindsey Vonn optimistic about Sochi despite new setback", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/12/21/lindsey-vonn-optimistic-about-sochi-despite-new-setback/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131218__Vonn121813p1-2.jpg", "height": 447}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131218__Vonn121813p1-2.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-12-21T07:26:27+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T10:52:17+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd4de\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI\u2019m going to play it safe and race minimal races, so I can get the confidence and the timing and the feeling of racing again.\nShortly after Vonn went out, Woods walked away from the finish area as camera crews scrambled to keep up with him.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t hurt myself more than I\u2019m already hurt,\u201d said Vonn, the reigning Olympic downhill champion.\nVAL D\u2019ISERE, France\u2014 Lindsey Vonn felt her injured right knee give way and for a moment it looked like her chances for another Olympic gold might be in jeopardy.\n\u201cIt was a small compression, and it was fully loaded on the right ski and my knee just completely gave out."}
