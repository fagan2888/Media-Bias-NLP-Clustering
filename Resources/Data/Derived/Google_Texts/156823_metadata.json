( Stephanie O'Neill/KPCC )\n\nFrequent medical visits had become a way of life earlier this year for John and Audrey Stanton.\n\nJohn, 86, suffered from serious eye problems, a painful skin infection called cellulitis and, more recently, repeated shortness of breath \u2014 all of which kept landing him in the hospital.\n\n\u201cIt was one thing after another. Like the doctor said, \u2018Somebody is after you!\u2019 \u201d Stanton laughs.\n\nAnd for his 81-year-old wife, Audrey, the nearly two-hour drive each way to Kaiser in Riverside from their home in Hemet was a tough haul.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a long-distance driver so I had to be real careful,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was stressful.\u201d\n\nBut that stress dissipated last summer when John was admitted to the hospital \u2014 without leaving home.\n\n\u201cI thought, \u2018Wow! This is amazing. I love this!\u2019 \u201d John Stanton says. \u201cThis is what people need!\u201d\n\nPneumonia, Cellulitis or Congestive Heart Failure\n\nStanton is one of about 125 patients who have been enrolled in an experimental \u201chospital at home\u201d program run out of Kaiser\u2019s Permanente\u2019s Riverside Medical Center.\n\nLaunched two years ago, the program is designed for people who need treatment \u2014 typically only given in the hospital \u2014 for one of three conditions: pneumonia, cellulitis or congestive heart failure.\n\nRead the rest of the story at KPCC.org.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hospital care at home is for patients with certain conditions who are not at risk for complications.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"In Kaiser Program, Hospital Care Comes to the Patient's Home\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2016\\/01\\/19\\/in-kaiser-program-hospital-care-comes-to-the-patients-home\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2016-01-19 09:43:19\",\"mod_date\":\"2016-01-19 17:12:22\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":140645,\"author_id\":\"8344\",\"author_name\":\"State of Health\",\"author_display_name\":\"State of Health\",\"tags\":[\"Health Costs\",\"Kaiser\",\"News\"],\"categories\":[\"Community Health\",\"Tests &amp; Treatments\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2016\\/01\\/Screen-Shot-2016-01-19-at-9.29.40-AM.png\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "Hospital care at home is for patients with certain conditions who are not at risk for complications.", "title": "In Kaiser Program, Hospital Care Comes to the Patient\u2019s Home", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2016/01/19/in-kaiser-program-hospital-care-comes-to-the-patients-home/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2016/01/Screen-Shot-2016-01-19-at-9.29.40-AM.png", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "health costs,kaiser,news", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Dr. Earl Quijada of Kaiser Permanente visits with John Stanton in the kitchen of Stanton's home in Hemet.\n( Stephanie O'Neill/KPCC )Frequent medical visits had become a way of life earlier this year for John and Audrey Stanton.\nI love this!\u2019 \u201d John Stanton says.\n\u201cThis is what people need!\u201dPneumonia, Cellulitis or Congestive Heart FailureStanton is one of about 125 patients who have been enrolled in an experimental \u201chospital at home\u201d program run out of Kaiser\u2019s Permanente\u2019s Riverside Medical Center.\nAnd for his 81-year-old wife, Audrey, the nearly two-hour drive each way to Kaiser in Riverside from their home in Hemet was a tough haul."}
