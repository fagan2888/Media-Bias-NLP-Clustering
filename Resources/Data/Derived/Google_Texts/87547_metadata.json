The president said:\n\nOBAMA: Our nation was founded on a bedrock principle that we are all created equal. The project of each generation is to bridge the meaning of those founding words with the realities of changing times \u2014 a never-ending quest to ensure those words ring true for every single American. We are big and vast and diverse, a nation of people with different backgrounds and beliefs, different experiences and stories but bound by the shared ideal that no matter who you are or what you look like, how you started off or how and who you love, America is a place where you can write your own destiny.\n\nWe are people who believe every child is entitled to life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness. There is so much more work to be done to extend the full promise of America to every American. But today, we can say in no uncertain terms that we\u2019ve made our union a little more perfect.\n\nDowns responds, \u201d Most striking is his utterance that \u201cwe are people who believe every child is entitled to life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\u201d President Obama\u2019s stance as the most pro-abortion president appears in direct conflict with the values he espouses. Why does Obama not see preborn children as worthy of basic human rights? How can any child \u201cwrite [his] own destiny\u201d if he has been aborted?\u201d\n\nShe continued: \u201cPresident Obama talks about love. What about love for the preborn? Shouldn\u2019t we respect people, at least enough to allow them to born? Why should it matter if they are still developing inside their mother\u2019s wombs?\u201d\n\nObama also left out unborn children earlier this month.\n\nOn June 9, President Barack Obama spoke before the Catholic Health Association and said that his first job out of college taught him that \u201cevery human being, made in the image of God, deserves to live in dignity.\u201d According to CNS News, he also said that \u201call children\u2026ought to have the opportunity to achieve their God-given potential.\u201d\n\nObama\u2019s speech is literally mind blowing, considering his radical support for abortion-on-demand in America and around the world. As LifeNews previously reported, in 2009, Obama started his presidency with a bang by giving China, one of the worst countries in the world for sex-trafficking, millions of dollar to fund their brutal one-child policy. Then he promised the American people that his health care policy, Obamacare, would not fund abortion. However, four years later, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) released a report that showed that Obamacare plans cover abortion and receive taxpayer subsides.\n\nClick here to sign up for daily pro-life news alerts from LifeNews.com\n\nOf course, Obama has also rallied behind Planned Parenthood, the largest abortion business in America. In 2013, Marjorie Dannenfeiser, the president of the pro-life Susan B. Anthony List, said the following about Obama\u2019s support for Planned Parenthood: \u201cThere is no industry that President Obama is more willing to protect than the abortion industry and particularly Planned Parenthood, the nation\u2019s biggest abortion provider, which in a single year performed more than 333,000 abortions. The president has defended federal funding for Planned Parenthood to the point of being willing to shut down the government over the continuing resolution battle, and in return they spent a record amount to reelect him in November.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, in 2013, he praised the abortion giant and said he wanted God to bless them. He said, \u201cAs long as we\u2019ve got to fight to make sure women have access to quality, affordable health care, and as long as we\u2019ve got to fight to protect a woman\u2019s right to make her own choices about her own health, I want you to know that you\u2019ve also got a president who\u2019s going to be right there with you, fighting every step of the way. Thank you, Planned Parenthood. God bless you.\u201d\n\nMost recently, President Obama has showed his extreme abortion views by threatening to veto the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, which would protect babies after 20-weeks from abortion based on the concept that they can feel pain. In January, the Obama administration said in a press release: \u201cThe Administration strongly opposes H.R. 36, which would unacceptably restrict women\u2019s health and reproductive rights and is an assault on a woman\u2019s right to choose. Women should be able to make their own choices about their bodies and their health care, and Government should not inject itself into decisions best made between a woman and her doctor.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Irony: Obama Says \"We Believe Every Child is Entitled to Life.\" Except Unborn Children", "og": {"site_name": "LifeNews.com", "description": "When President Barack Obama responded to the recent Supreme Court decision concerning gay marriage, he made some comments that made pro-life advocates take noti", "title": "Irony: Obama Says \u201cWe Believe Every Child is Entitled to Life.\u201d Except Unborn Children", "url": "http://www.lifenews.com/2015/07/01/irony-obama-says-we-believe-every-child-is-entitled-to-life-except-unborn-children/", "image": "http://www.lifenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/barackobama28.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 204509779594999}, "OBKey": "avejq02j7xRr+0owuq+Pcw==", "keywords": "barack obama: \"we believe every child is entitled to life,\" except unborn children,barack obama: we believe every child is entitled to life,except unborn children", "google-site-verification": "PPPx-GD0i7nWjUFAYnFdOYorAAJLuNyKOl23JCeXyrQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "How can any child \u201cwrite [his] own destiny\u201d if he has been aborted?\u201dShe continued: \u201cPresident Obama talks about love.\nWe are people who believe every child is entitled to life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\nThank you, Planned Parenthood.\nClick here to sign up for daily pro-life news alerts from LifeNews.comOf course, Obama has also rallied behind Planned Parenthood, the largest abortion business in America.\nWhy should it matter if they are still developing inside their mother\u2019s wombs?\u201dObama also left out unborn children earlier this month."}
