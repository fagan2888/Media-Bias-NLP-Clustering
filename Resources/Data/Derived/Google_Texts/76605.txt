Sioux Falls, SD

Some Minnesota Vikings Cheerleaders made a special appearance in Sioux Falls Saturday.

Karmen and Kirsten Nyberg came to their family's Nyberg's Ace Store on Minnesota Avenue early Saturday morning.

The Sioux Falls natives took pictures with fans and autographed their Minnesota Viking Cheerleader calendars. Tons of fans came dressed in Vikings jerseys, sweaters, and hats. One woman says she was thrilled when she heard the cheerleaders were coming to town. She's a committed Vikings fan.

"It was the thing. It's been the Vikings my whole life. Through the ups and downs. It's like a marriage. Sometimes it's good, sometimes it's bad," fan Linda Starks said.

The first 500 fans wearing their favorite football apparel got a free Minnesota Vikings game schedule. The best-dressed Minnesota Vikings fan had the chance to win a $100 Nyberg's Ace Gift Card.
