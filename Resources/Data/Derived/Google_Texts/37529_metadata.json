representing the city\u2019s correction officers has quietly filed a lawsuit in Manhattan federal court, claiming ObamaCare will bankrupt its health care fund, The Post has learned.\n\nThe Correction Officers Benevolent Association maintains a supplemental medical fund for members that sets a $10,000 annual cap per family on prescription drug benefits.\n\nThe fund also provides optical and dental benefits.\n\nBut the new federal heath care law bars the union from imposing annual limits on drug purchases \u2014 in essence, making the Affordable Care Act unaffordable, the lawsuit alleges.\n\n\u201cObamaCare will bankrupt us,\u201d said COBA President Norman Seabrook.\n\nThe lawsuit, which lists President Obama and other federal officials as defendants, said the lifting of the cap has resulted in \u201cskyrocketing costs.\u201d\n\nThe union estimated that two dozen members exceeded the previously imposed $10,000 cap and two participants were running up prescription bills of more than $50,000 each.\n\nThe union said in the June suit that the cap \u2014 coupled with 30 percent co-payments and mandatory use of generic drugs \u2014 was put in place to control costs and keep the fund solvent.\n\nThe city is the main source of funding, kicking in $1,780 per member.\n\nCOBA complained that its petition to the Obama administration seeking an exemption \u201cfell on deaf ears\u201d \u2014 hence, the lawsuit.\n\nThe suit, before Judge Shira Scheindlin, claims ObamaCare is anti-union and unconstitutional.\n\n\u201cThe regulators\u2019 refusal to grant the requested exemption violates the equal-protection and free-association rights of union members and their dependents,\u201d COBA lawyer Howard Wien claimed.\n\n\u201cThe only reason they are threatened with the loss of their prescription-drug coverage is their association with a labor union and one another.\u201d\n\nThe COBA suit said the health-law edict leaves difficult choices: Shut down the fund, severely limit benefits \u2014 or put all its money into saving the fund at the expense of \u00adofficers\u2019 wages and retirement benefits.\n\nCOBA appears to have gotten the attention of Obama health officials.\n\nIn a Nov. 21 court filing, the federal defendants requested a four-month stay to examine whether they can exempt COBA from the cost rule and potentially settle the case.\n\n\u201cThe administrative-assessment process might ultimately obviate the need for this litigation to continue,\u201d said Assistant Manhattan US Attorney Rebec\u00adca Tinio, responding on behalf of the administration.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "New York Post", "twitter": {"description": "The union representing the city\u2019s correction officers has quietly filed a
