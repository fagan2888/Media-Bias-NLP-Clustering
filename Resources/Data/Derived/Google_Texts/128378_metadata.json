Maryland Avenue. As officers responded to the area, they observed a pickup truck fleeing the area. The pickup truck was abandoned in a nearby apartment complex at 6400 W. Maryland Avenue. The pickup truck matched the description of the pickup truck from the prior incident.\n\nSeveral minutes after the vehicle was found abandoned, officers were contacted by a witness at a nearby bus stop at 6400 N. 67th Avenue who stated he observed a Hispanic adult male wearing a white, possibly striped shirt at the bus stop. The witness stated he observed the male suspect firing a gun directly at the officers\u2019 vehicles as they responded to the area.\n\nThe officers never knew they were being fired upon. A perimeter was established, and Glendale Police utilized all resources available to them to locate the suspect, including air support, SWAT and K9 units. They were unable to locate the suspect.\n\nGlendale detectives have been diligently working this case. They have confirmed that the pickup truck observed by officers at the Gateway patrol police station was the same vehicle observed in the second incident in the area near 6400 W. Maryland Avenue. They have identified the owner of the vehicle as David Romero, an 18-year-old Peoria resident. He also goes by the name of David Herrera.\n\nDetectives were able to contact family members and friends of Herrera. He had reportedly made statements to family earlier today that he wanted to harm himself.\n\nDetectives have information that leads them to believe that Herrera was the driver of the pickup truck observed in both incidents. It is also believed that he may have been the 911 caller. No citizens or officers were injured during these two incidents.\n\nGlendale police have not located Herrera and believe he may be armed. He does not have a criminal history. But police are concerned for his welfare as well as the public\u2019s welfare.\n\nThe Glendale Police Department is encouraging Herrera to come forward and speak to detectives. Police are also asking for the public\u2019s assistance in locating Herrera. If you have any information on his whereabouts, please contact Glendale Police at 623-930-3000 or Silent Witness at 480-Witness.\n\nCopyright 2016 KPHO/KTVK (KPHO Broadcasting Corporation).
