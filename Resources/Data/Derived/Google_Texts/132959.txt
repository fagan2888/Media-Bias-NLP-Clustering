The most interesting phenomena you will find at the 2015 Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in National Harbor, Md., isn't the straw poll of potential presidential candidates. It is the sharp divide on social issues between the young and old attendees that may be moving the conservative movement into the 21st century.

"If they want to, fine, but don't shove it down my throat," argued one older CPAC attendee about gay marriage. While many long time conservatives hold the same kind of icky aversion to the thought of two men or two women joining nuptials, the Reason-Rupe poll in June 2014 found that 53 percent of millennials would get behind a candidate who is both socially liberal and fiscally conservative.

"I think it's really unfair to preach a free market and to preach liberty yet at the same time be advocating for laws that tell you who you can and cannot be with in your own bedroom," said one young CPAC attendee.

That push towards individual freedom also extends to legalizing recreational marijuana. CPAC even hosted a debate this year between former Libertarian Party presidential candidate Gary Johnson and New York Republican Rep. Ann Marie Buerkle over legalizing pot.
