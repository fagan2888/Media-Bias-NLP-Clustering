Pete Dugan, a department spokesman.\n\nPolice received reports that two vehicles were chasing each other with shots being fired from at least one of them, he said.\n\nOne of the vehicles crashed into some boulders, and all the occupants fled and have not been located.\n\n\"We don't even have a victim in this,\" Dugan said.\n\nDetective have been canvassing the area to see whether any bullets struck homes or if people could offer any information about the vehicles involved.\n\nSo far, nothing, he said.\n\nEven if nobody was struck by gunfire, the activity was enough to rattle the neighborhood.\n\nResidents along the street said everything happened very quickly.They say heard the gun shots and saw the cars driving away.\n\n\"I heard some noise. Thought it was firecrackers,\" said Frank Maurici, a resident in the area.\n\n\"I came outside and a car flew by and we realized it was gunshots. You could kind of tell it happened down the street and it was starting to come up the street and before you know it, they were gone,\" he said.\n\nMaurici said children play out in the yards often and he's glad no children were around when the incident happened.\n\nA KOLD viewer who did not want to be identified said her children were outside playing when the cars came blasting through with what seemed to her like never ending gunfire.\n\nAnyone with information should call 911 or the 88-CRIME anonymous tip line.\n\nCopyright 2016 Tucson News Now.
