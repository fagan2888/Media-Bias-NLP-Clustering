Doctors and hospitals will also face new penalties for failing to comply with federal rules such as those requiring the use of e-records.\n\nThe stakes are high in 2015. The administration will be hoping that ObamaCare regains ground after a muddy patch over the last few weeks that included controversies around the administration\u2019s famously blunt former adviser Jonathan Gruber, an inflated enrollment tally and a new legal threat to the law\u2019s subsidies.\n\nEmployer mandate goes into effect\n\nAfter years of delays, businesses with at least 100 employees will be forced to offer insurance for the first time in 2015.\n\nBusiness groups have lobbied hard against the controversial rule, which they have called a major headache that will force layoffs and less hours for workers.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe twice-delayed penalty has also been tweaked over the last two years to require less paperwork for employers. Medium-sized companies, with staffs of between 50 and 100, will have until 2016 to offer coverage.\n\nThe GOP-led House has voted numerous times to delay \u2013 and ultimately repeal \u2013 the employer mandate. The Senate\u2019s incoming Republican leadership has also floated the same approach as part of its battle plan in 2015.\n\nFines levied for individual mandate\n\nMost Americans have been required to have health insurance since January 2014, but the financial penalties for those who ignored the mandate will only go into effect during tax season this spring.\n\nEach person without insurance will pay $95 or 1 percent of their income, whichever is higher.\n\nThe mandate is a crucial part of ObamaCare, meant to push people of all ages and health conditions to seek coverage \u2013 and balance the influx of older and sicker people who were expected to flood the marketplaces with younger, healthier counterparts.\n\nImplementing the new fines next year will require full attention from the Internal Revenue Service. It will likely be a major challenge for the already cash-strapped agency that is dealing with sharp budget cuts and new responsibilities such as the employer mandate.\n\nPrimary care doctors face pay cut\n\nFamily doctors who treat Medicaid patients will see steep drops in payments from the federal government that could make it tougher for millions of low-income people to find care.\n\nReimbursements from Medicaid will shrink an average of 43 percent starting in January, when the federal government\u2019s temporary raise for primary care doctors is set to expire.\n\nThe federal government had raised its reimbursement rates to entice more doctors to accept Medicaid patients under ObamaCare. Patients with Medicaid have been historically known to cost healthcare providers far more than they are repaid for the treatment, causing some doctors to turn away patients.\n\nMedicaid has added 10 million people to its rolls under ObamaCare, reaching a total of 63 million enrollees this year. While Congress decided not to make the hikes permanent, at least 15 states will keep at least a portion of the new payment rates to help Medicaid patients.\n\nMedicare doctors fined for not using e-records\n\nMore than 270,000 doctors and 200 hospitals nationwide will see funding cuts from Medicare next year for failing to meet new government requirements for electronic medical records.\n\nThe Obama administration has sought to encourage \u201cmeaningful use\u201d of e-records and e-prescribing systems to make healthcare providers more efficient and cut down on communication errors that can harm patients.\n\nBut the effort has come under fire from some providers who say patients are harmed by the cuts to their reimbursement rates. The cuts will increase to 3 percent within three years.\n\nElectronic medical records have been increasingly adopted by healthcare providers across the country, though the steep investment costs \u2013 about $165,000 for an average five-person practice in the first year \u2013 continue to be a burden.\n\nCHIP funding set to expire\n\nA 27-year program that has helped millions of children gain insurance is set to end next year without new steps from Congress.\n\nUnder ObamaCare, the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, or CHIP, is reauthorized until 2019 but only funded through September of next year.\n\nThe program provides coverage to about 8 million children annually and has been praised by lawmakers of both parties.\n\nStill, members of Congress have failed to take steps to fund the program despite urgent pleas from governors who say they need to know immediately whether the program will end.\n\nWhile some of the children currently enrolled could now find other options under ObamaCare, the program\u2019s coverage tends to be more generous with deductibles and copays, as well as wider doctor networks, than cheaper plans on the exchanges.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The new year brings high stakes for President Obama's signature domestic law.", "description": "The new year brings high stakes for President Obama's signature domestic law.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Sarah Ferris", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The new year brings high stakes for President Obama's signature domestic law.", "title": "ObamaCare's 2015 challenges", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/228294-obamacares-2015-challenges", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/healthcareobamacare1_081214getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-01-01T13:30:01-05:00", "type": "article"}, "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2015-01-01T13:30-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/228294-obamacares-2015-challenges", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "dcterms.date": "2015-01-01T13:30-05:00", "dcterms.creator": "Niall Stanage", "dcterms.type": "Text", "article": {"published_time": "2015-01-01T13:30:03-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-01T13:30:01-05:00"}, "keywords": "Affordable Care Act, ObamaCare, Health care, Health insurance,President Obama,", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/228294-obamacares-2015-challenges", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The new year brings high stakes for President Obama's signature domestic law.", "card": "summary", "title": "ObamaCare's 2015 challenges"}, "dcterms.title": "ObamaCare's 2015 challenges"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfd69\"", "article_summary": "Both the individual mandate and the employer mandate \u2013 which are considered vital pillars of the president\u2019s landmark healthcare law \u2013 will confront new challenges in 2015.\nUnder ObamaCare, the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, or CHIP, is reauthorized until 2019 but only funded through September of next year.\nWhile Congress decided not to make the hikes permanent, at least 15 states will keep at least a portion of the new payment rates to help Medicaid patients.\nThe federal government had raised its reimbursement rates to entice more doctors to accept Medicaid patients under ObamaCare.\nThe Senate\u2019s incoming Republican leadership has also floated the same approach as part of its battle plan in 2015."}
