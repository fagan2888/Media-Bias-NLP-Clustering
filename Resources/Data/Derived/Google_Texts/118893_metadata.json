Just one in five women were able to correctly identify the most effective form of contraception that\u2019s currently available, and most of the participants said they didn\u2019t feel very knowledgeable about their different birth control options.\n\nThe American College of Nurse Midwives surveyed a nationally representative sample of women between the ages of 18 and 45. When asked which method of birth control most effectively prevents pregnancy, nearly 75 percent of women chose abstinence. Many women also ranked oral birth control pills and the male condom at the top \u2014 while just 20 percent chose the IUD, which medical professionals actually consider to be the most effective contraceptive (chart courtesy of the Huffington Post):\n\nIt\u2019s perhaps not surprising that so many respondents chose abstinence, considering the United States\u2019 current approach to sexual health information. For the past two decades, social conservatives have successfully rolled back comprehensive sex ed requirements in public schools, creating a patchwork of state-level laws that allow many Americans to grow up without any accurate information about contraception. In reality, however, abstinence is hardly a foolproof method. Studies have shown that even when teens pledge they\u2019ll remain abstinent, many of them don\u2019t actually follow through.\n\nThe same type of user error impacts the pill\u2019s effectiveness. Although oral birth control pills are more than 99 percent effective when taken correctly, many women don\u2019t always take them exactly as directed \u2014 some accidentally skip pills, and some put off refilling their birth control prescription in order to save money. The CDC estimates that about nine percent of the women who use the pill end up accidentally getting pregnant. When it comes to condoms, the failure rate is even higher, at about 18 percent.\n\nIn fact, the contraceptive methods that the survey participants ranked lower \u2014 the IUD and the implant \u2014 are much more effective because they have less potential for user error. One recent study found that women who use an IUD are 20 times less likely to accidentally get pregnant than the women who use a shorter-term form of contraception, like the pill.\n\nMany of the women who participated in the American College of Nurse Midwives\u2019 survey acknowledged that they don\u2019t know feel well-informed about contraception. A full 70 percent said they were \u201cvery knowledgeable\u201d about abstinence, while less than half said the same for the pill. Just 21 percent said they knew a lot about the IUD.\n\nThat may be because they\u2019re not having conversations about birth control with their doctors. Forty percent of women said they hadn\u2019t received in-depth counseling from their health care professional about birth control, and one in ten said they had questions about contraception they didn\u2019t feel comfortable asking. The group that commissioned the survey hopes the results will help encourage a shift in the way that women and their doctors talk about birth control, particularly as Obamacare\u2019s birth control benefit expands the pool of women who can afford a wide range of contraceptive services.\n\n\u201cThese survey findings are especially timely given the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, which enables more women to have access to contraceptive services,\u201d the American College of Nurse Midwives\u2019 president, Ginger Breedlove, noted in a statement. \u201cWomen deserve complete and practical information delivered in positive, respectful conversations by an engaging health care professional. If we can create an environment of healthy dialogue and shared decision making, we can help change perceptions so women make educated choices that are best suited to their needs.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Most women say that abstinence is the best way to prevent pregnancy -- and a meager 20 percent can correctly identify IUDs as the most effective form of birth control.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "Most women say that abstinence is the best way to prevent pregnancy -- and a meager 20 percent can correctly identify IUDs as the most effective form of birth control.", "title": "Most U.S. Women Don\u2019t Know Which Types Of Birth Control Are The Best At Preventing Pregnancy", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2013/10/10/2763151/women-misinformed-birth-control/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/birth_control_tpftd.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Most women say that abstinence is the best way to prevent pregnancy -- and a meager 20 percent can correctly identify IUDs as the most effective form of birth control.", "creator": "@Tara_CR", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/birth_control_tpftd-321x214.jpg", "title": "Most U.S. Women Don\u2019t Know Which Types Of Birth Control Are The Best At Preventing Pregnancy", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/birth_control_tpftd.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/birth_control_tpftd.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2013-10-10T12:17:50+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/tculpressler"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd37bb\"", "article_summary": "When asked which method of birth control most effectively prevents pregnancy, nearly 75 percent of women chose abstinence.\nHealth Most U.S. Women Don\u2019t Know Which Types Of Birth Control Are The Best At Preventing Pregnancy CREDIT: BeathanThe majority of U.S. women are misinformed about birth control\u2019s effectiveness, according to a new survey conducted by the American College of Nurse Midwives.\nMany of the women who participated in the American College of Nurse Midwives\u2019 survey acknowledged that they don\u2019t know feel well-informed about contraception.\nThat may be because they\u2019re not having conversations about birth control with their doctors.\nThe American College of Nurse Midwives surveyed a nationally representative sample of women between the ages of 18 and 45."}
