But if they do, Lucia says, \u201cmost people at that income level would not be able to afford those costs.\u201d\n\nQ: I pay a monthly premium but still have a huge deductible and out-of-pocket amounts. Should I just forego the insurance and pay the Obamacare tax penalty?\n\nA: I wouldn\u2019t advise anyone to be uninsured. The financial stakes are too high.\n\nBut as Melody Lewis, 60, rightly notes, the financial stakes can be high even with insurance.\n\nLewis has a silver-level plan from Covered California, the state health insurance exchange. It has a $2,000 medical deductible and $6,250 out-of-pocket maximum.\n\nA deductible is the amount you owe for covered health care services before your insurance starts to pay. An out-of-pocket maximum is the most you would pay during the term of your health policy \u2013 usually one year \u2013 before your insurance begins paying 100 percent of covered services.\n\nThe Hemet resident has degenerative disc disease in her neck and has shelled out more than $4,000 for treatment this year that isn\u2019t covered by her insurance and therefore isn\u2019t counted toward her deductible.\n\n\u201cIt basically turns out to be catastrophic insurance,\u201d says Lewis, who retired to care for her husband and is on a fixed income.\n\nA recent Kaiser Family Foundation survey of 4,555 Californians found that 65 percent of California residents who are newly insured since Jan. 1, 2014, say they\u2019re not confident they can afford major medical costs.\n\nOnce again, these are people with insurance.\n\nThis problem isn\u2019t unique to Covered California, but the agency says it is making some changes next year to reduce out-of-pocket costs, such as capping the amount consumers have to pay each month for specialty drugs.\n\nIt also will offer bronze plan holders lab work, some outpatient services and three office visits \u2013 including visits to specialists \u2013 that are not subject to the deductible, says spokesman James Scullary. For silver plan holders, medical imaging such as MRIs will no longer be subject to the deductible, he says.\n\nAmong Covered California\u2019s \u201cmetal tiers,\u201d bronze plans have the lowest monthly premiums but the highest out-of-pocket costs. Platinum plans have the highest monthly premiums, but lower out-of-pocket costs.\n\nIn that way, out-of-pocket affordability is often a \u201cbronze\u201d problem. The Urban Institute found that among insured adults, those with higher deductibles have more problems paying medical bills.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nr6nj1-b88450484z.120150708115937000gm3ap49v.10.jpg", "content_section": "news", "content_title": "HEALTH INSURANCE: Beware out-of-pocket costs", "og": {"site_name": "Press Enterprise", "description": "News: HEALTH INSURANCE: Beware out-of-pocket costs | pocket, insurance, health, pay, deductible, says, covered, california, plan, people", "title": "HEALTH INSURANCE: Beware out-of-pocket costs", "locale": "en", "image": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/article/nr6nj1-b88450484z.120150708115937000gm3ap49v.10.jpg", "url": "http://www.pe.com/articles/pocket-772732-insurance-health.html", "type": "article"}, "section": "news", "sailthru.date": "2015-07-08 11:59:37", "sailthru.title": "HEALTH INSURANCE: Beware out-of-pocket costs", "sailthru.tags": "news, pocket, insurance, health, pay, deductible, says, covered, california, plan, people", "fb": {"app_id": 1413700038878423}, "content_thumbnail": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nr6nj1-b88450484z.120150708115937000gm3ap49v.10.jpg", "content_type": "article", "Keywords": "pocket, insurance, health, pay, deductible, says, covered, california, plan, people", "publication_date": "2015-07-08", "sailthru.image.full": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/nr6nj1-b88450484z.120150708115937000gm3ap49v.10.jpg", "Description": "News: HEALTH INSURANCE: Beware out-of-pocket costs | pocket, insurance, health, pay, deductible, says, covered, california, plan, people"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb828\"", "article_summary": "In today\u2019s column, I address the price you pay for health insurance beyond your premiums: deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses.\nBut the ruling doesn\u2019t address affordability, and that means millions of Americans also will continue their struggle to pay for health insurance costs.\nMillions of Americans will continue receiving tax credits to help pay for their health insurance, thanks to the recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling on Obamacare.\nAs I said in my previous column, even some people who receive tax credits have trouble paying their monthly premiums.\nPlatinum plans have the highest monthly premiums, but lower out-of-pocket costs."}
