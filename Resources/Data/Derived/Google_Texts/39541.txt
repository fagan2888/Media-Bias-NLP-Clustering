TEMPE, Ariz. — The Arizona Cardinals have hired Jen Welter to coach inside linebackers through their upcoming training camp and preseason.

The Cardinals say Welter is believed to be the first woman to hold a coaching position of any kind in the NFL. Welter played running back and special teams in 2014 for the Texas Revolution of the Indoor Football League, becoming the first woman to hold a non-kicking position for a men’s professional sports league.

She coached linebackers and special teams for the Revolution last season, becoming the first woman to coach in a men’s pro football league.

Welter played linebacker for more than 14 seasons with the Dallas Diamonds of the Women’s Football Alliance and holds a master’s degree in sports psychology.
