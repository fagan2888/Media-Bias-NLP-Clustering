So that started me on the path of wanting to do something along the lines of funerals and death care.\u201d\n\nBut when she looked into selling caskets, Champion found that it was illegal. Alabama law only allowed licensed funeral directors to sell them. She said she dropped it at first.\n\n\u201cThen my father died \u2026 six years ago, and so I went through the same thing again,\u201d she said. \u201cHis funeral was identical to my mother\u2019s and it cost $12,500, which just blows me away.\u201d\n\nAfter that, she said she started to think about funerals again, and this time she decided to build Good Earth LLC, a green cemetery in Hazel Green.\n\n\u201cAnd now it\u2019s become my passion,\u201d she added.\n\n\u201cI was a hospice volunteer for a year, and sitting with hospice patients also pushed me along this path a little better because they want to be home to die. So why would you want to be home to die, but then be whisked away to a strange place and have a stranger bathe you, embalm you, dress you, put makeup on you, and put you on display?\u201d she told The Daily Signal.\n\nChampion explained that green burials are unique because they involve entirely biodegradable materials such as wool, linen, or cotton and wooden or cardboard caskets. The funeral is also special, she said, because family takes care of the their deceased loved ones, rather than a funeral home. She said the natural burial materials are also much cheaper and better for the environment than traditional caskets and funeral home embalmings.\n\nHowever, Alabama licensing law still prevents Champion from selling natural burial materials.\n\nEarlier this month Champion filed suit with the District Court for the Northern District of Alabama, Northern Division to challenge the law.\n\n\u201cI think the bottom line in this case is that Alabama requires a license to sell a cardboard box,\u201d Champion\u2019s attorney Ren\u00e9e Flaherty of the Institute for Justice, a nonprofit law firm, told The Daily Signal.\n\n\u201cYou know, it\u2019s kind of ridiculous, Shelia\u2019s, what she\u2019s selling is very simple and inexpensive, and you know she\u2019s not able \u2026 to sell a cardboard box without a license,\u201d Flaherty added.\n\nIn 2013, the Institute for Justice won a similar case in Louisiana where monks had to obtain a license in order to sell handmade wooden caskets.\n\nFlaherty said that in the Louisiana case, the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals found the Louisiana licensing law unconstitutional because it had been implemented to protect licensed funeral directors from competition, which is not a legitimate government interest.\n\nFlaherty said Champion\u2019s case could take a year or more to play out, but she is prepared to take it all the way if need be.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re willing to take [this case] all the way to the United States Supreme Court if we have to because this case touches on a really important issue that the federal courts are in disagreement about,\u201d she said, \u201cand that is, whether laws like this that their only purpose is to protect private financial interests, in this case the licensed funeral directors, whether that kind of economic protectionism is a legitimate interest of government.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat the people all over the United States and Alabama need to do is pay more attention to the laws that are being passed,\u201d Champion said, \u201cthe ridiculous laws that protect the funeral directors, funeral homes, and have nothing to do with the good of the people.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo I\u2019m on a mission to educate people as to what their rights are at the end of life as well as ways that they can honor their loved ones and spend less money.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Alabama licensing law prevents green casket-maker Shelia Champion from selling natural burial materials.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Alabama licensing law prevents green casket-maker Shelia Champion from selling natural burial materials.", "title": "Green Cemetery Owner Fights Law Restricting Casket Sales", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/alabama-caskets-shelia-IFJ_0982-edit.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-04-25T13:49:04+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1Vhazx8"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Alabama licensing law prevents green casket-maker Shelia Champion from selling natural burial materials.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/alabama-caskets-shelia-IFJ_0982-edit.jpg"}, "title": "Green Cemetery Owner Fights Law Restricting Casket Sales", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Economy", "tag": "economic freedom,regulation", "published_time": "2016-04-19T14:13:41+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-25T13:49:04+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Shelia Champion, Institute for Justice, Alabama licensing laws, casket, funeral"}, "article_summary": "Alabama law only allowed licensed funeral directors to sell them.\nHowever, Alabama licensing law still prevents Champion from selling natural burial materials.\nEarlier this month Champion filed suit with the District Court for the Northern District of Alabama, Northern Division to challenge the law.\nShe said the natural burial materials are also much cheaper and better for the environment than traditional caskets and funeral home embalmings.\nSo that started me on the path of wanting to do something along the lines of funerals and death care.\u201dBut when she looked into selling caskets, Champion found that it was illegal."}
