The brutal conflict between traditional, moderate fitness aficionados at franchise gyms and the growing radical Crossfit movement escalated tragically yesterday, as a suicide bomb exploded in a 24-Hour Fitness in the LaJolla neighborhood of San Diego, killing 5 and wounding 12.\n\nThe alleged perpetrator, Johhny \u201cBurpee\u201d Lawrence, 26, was a member of Crossfit Jihad, a militant fitness group known to meet in an extremist training facility, or what is called a \u201cbox\u201d in Crossfit doctrine. Lawrence\u2019s \u201cbox\u201d trained in the garage of a local leader, or \u201ccoach,\u201d Mick McAllister.\n\nLawrence apparently gained entry to the 24-Hour Fitness by pretending to be a member.\n\nTagg Romney, a witness to the attack, said, \u201cHe came to the front desk and said he\u2019d forgotten his Vibram Five-Fingers in the locker room and that he\u2019d just be a second. He was wearing what I thought was one of those weight vests, and I thought it was really strange that he was wearing a weighted vest around and that he actually uses those hideous Five-Fingers shoes. I mean, who does that?\u201d\n\nAnother survivor, Thurston Howell, said, \u201cHe went straight to the Nautilus section, and yelled, \u2018Uncle Rhabdo!!!\u2019 Whatever the hell that means. I knew something bad was happening, so I ducked behind the elliptical. Then I heard a big explosion and I passed out.\u201d\n\nCrossfit Jihad released a statement on its blog claiming responsibility. \u201cWe salute our brother who took a stand against the corporate gym apostates. We will continue to strike against all infidel gyms and trainers that worship the false idols of outdated cardio and isolation movements. We shall name a workout in his honor. There is no WOD but WOD, and Greg Glassman is its messenger.\u201d The term \u201cWOD\u201d is often used by group members to refer to the \u201cworkout of the day,\u201d prophetic visions and tasks given to Crossfitters by their coaches.\n\nLaw enforcement throughout southern California has been concerned about an escalating series of attacks by radical Crossfitters on moderate fitness facilities. In January, a Curves for Women in Orange County was terrorized by a group who hurled several kettlebells through the front windows. In March, a Planet Fitness in Escondido had two members\u2019 right arms cut off with scimitars by Crossfitters who saw them doing isolation curls. In April, prominent Beachbody trainer Shaun T died after being struck by multiple medicine balls. While the crime remains unsolved, police believe Crossfit radicals or affiliates may have been involved, due to the warning written at the scene,\u201dP90X = Jazzercise for Men. Death to Cardio!\u201d\n\nLieutenant Martin Riggs of the California Counterterrorism Task Force stated,\u201dWhile there are many peaceful and productive fitness enthusiasts in our communities, there are increasing numbers of radical Crossfitters in the area. It may be a reaction to the excesses of American fast-food culture and obesity. Extremely fit people feel threatened by this and cling to their Paleo food and extreme workouts.\u201d\n\nCrossfit Headquarters in Washington, DC, released a statement of condolence to the families of the victims. In it, the group stated, \u201cWe offer our deepest condolences to the families of the victims of this tragedy. While we understand the motivations behind this act, we cannot endorse it. We believe in the freedom of all people to practice their workouts as they see fit.\n\n\u201cWe aim to convert followers of false workout programs by constantly talking about our workouts and by wearing annoying T-shirts with double entendres about powerlifting, not by violence. Our boxes are independent entities whose coaches interpret the WOD for their members. Unfortunately, some of our coaches issue their own edicts, or fatWODs, that are inconsistent with the philosophy of Crossfit as expressed on our website. Crossfit is a workout of peace.\u201d\n\nLocal authorities urged residents to report any individuals exhibiting radical Crossfit signs and symbols, such as ridiculous socks, calloused hands, Paleo diets, and planking in inappropriate places.", "article_metadata": {"google-site-verification": "BJRhhAX0-HMwLuYcMtPOB6NAdO7bUX3D7seeI_tQT-Q", "generator": "Woo Framework Version 1.0.8"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe16d3\"", "article_summary": "The alleged perpetrator, Johhny \u201cBurpee\u201d Lawrence, 26, was a member of Crossfit Jihad, a militant fitness group known to meet in an extremist training facility, or what is called a \u201cbox\u201d in Crossfit doctrine.\nLaw enforcement throughout southern California has been concerned about an escalating series of attacks by radical Crossfitters on moderate fitness facilities.\nCrossfit is a workout of peace.\u201dLocal authorities urged residents to report any individuals exhibiting radical Crossfit signs and symbols, such as ridiculous socks, calloused hands, Paleo diets, and planking in inappropriate places.\nThe brutal conflict between traditional, moderate fitness aficionados at franchise gyms and the growing radical Crossfit movement escalated tragically yesterday, as a suicide bomb exploded in a 24-Hour Fitness in the LaJolla neighborhood of San Diego, killing 5 and wounding 12.\nLawrence apparently gained entry to the 24-Hour Fitness by pretending to be a member."}
