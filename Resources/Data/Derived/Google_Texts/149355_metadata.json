He also acknowledged Natividad labor representatives from SEIU asked for so many conditions on a potential letter of intent designed to set a framework for the talks that it scuttled any chance of moving forward.\n\nThe ad hoc committee hasn\u2019t met for months, Salinas said, noting that Salinas Valley Memorial officials also haven\u2019t inquired about the affiliation talks.\n\nSalinas said hospital administrators have been discussing common areas between the two institutions, and argued that cooperation doesn\u2019t require a formal partnership, whether through a joint powers authority or legislation.\n\nSalinas Valley Memorial CEO Pete Delgado acknowledged the public district hospital had focused on other priorities, including adjusting to the Affordable Care Act and quality care outcomes. But he also said hospital officials still believe there\u2019s an opportunity to partner with the county.\n\n\u201cWe stand ready to help them in any way,\u201d Delgado said. \u201cIf the opportunity to collaborate, to participate in any way, we\u2019re ready. It makes sense for two great organizations to work together on behalf of the community.\u201d\n\nThe hospital has also been dealing with contract negotiations with the powerful California Nurses Association since early last year, and only this week reached an agreement to enter mediation over the contentious talks after declaring an impasse late last year.\n\nSalinas Valley Memorial\u2019s proposal envisioned a joint powers authority between the hospital system and the county to operate Natividad. Salinas Valley Memorial also expressed concern about the county hospital\u2019s financial capacity to host a trauma center and requested the Board of Supervisors delay implementation until a thorough review of Natividad\u2019s finances was conducted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll three entities have expressed an interest in forming a partnership, arguing that cooperation would be better than competition given the demands of a changing health care industry under national reform. Natividad, led by Weis, submitted a partnership proposal during Salinas Valley Memorial\u2019s affiliation quest in 2012, but was rejected. County officials spearheaded a resumption of affiliation talks with Salinas Valley Memorial the following year. Those talks commenced \u2014 with Weis excluded \u2014 under a memorandum of understanding that expired Jan. 31 last year, just after Salinas Valley Memorial sent its proposal.\n\nThe two hospitals have seen a significant shift in their leadership ranks during the past year. Salinas Valley Memorial has added three new board members in last fall\u2019s election, and has seen a complete turnover on its five-member board since 2012. Natividad saw Weis depart and be replaced by interim CEO Dr. Kelly O\u2019Keefe, the former board chairman.\n\nCounty supervisors began the hiring process for a new Natividad CEO by engaging consultant firm Spencer Stuart in December to conduct a nationwide search for potential candidates. The $258,000 contract lasts through December but Salinas said he expects a new top administrator to be in place in the next six months.\n\nO\u2019Keefe said Friday he has decided he will not seek the permanent CEO position, citing the demands of filling the position on a long-term basis. His interim contract runs through Jan. 31 with subsequent extensions upon mutual consent. He said he will help with the search process for the new CEO.\n\nJim Johnson can be reached at 726-4348.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Salinas >> A year after Salinas Valley Memorial Hospital officials proposed formal affiliation talks with Monterey County and Natividad Medical Center, the county has still not responded and prospects for a partnership between two of the area", "title": "Salinas hospital, county talks on backburner", "og": {"url": "http://www.montereyherald.com/article/NF/20150123/NEWS/150129862", "image": {"width": "1500px", "identifier": "http://www.montereyherald.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/NF/20150123/NEWS/150129862/AR/0/AR-150129862.jpg?Maxh=1500&Maxw=1500", "height": "1186px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Salinas hospital, county talks on backburner"}, "twitter": {"domain": "montereyherald.com", "description": "Salinas >> A year after Salinas Valley Memorial Hospital officials proposed formal affiliation talks with Monterey County and Natividad Medical Center, the county has still not responded and prospects for a partnership between two of the area", "title": "Salinas hospital, county talks on backburner", "url": "http://www.montereyherald.com/article/NF/20150123/NEWS/150129862", "image": {"src": "http://www.montereyherald.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/NF/20150123/NEWS/150129862/AR/0/AR-150129862.jpg?Maxh=900&Maxw=900"}, "site": "@montereyherald", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id507308258", "iphone": "id507305181", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.montereyherald"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "keywords": "health,health care,health care industry,news_local, Health", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "health,health care,health care industry,news_local, Health"}, "article_summary": "The ad hoc committee hasn\u2019t met for months, Salinas said, noting that Salinas Valley Memorial officials also haven\u2019t inquired about the affiliation talks.\nCounty officials spearheaded a resumption of affiliation talks with Salinas Valley Memorial the following year.\nSalinas Valley Memorial\u2019s proposal envisioned a joint powers authority between the hospital system and the county to operate Natividad.\nSalinas >> A year after Salinas Valley Memorial Hospital officials proposed formal affiliation talks with Monterey County and Natividad Medical Center, the county has still not responded and prospects for a partnership between two of the area\u2019s largest health care organizations have dropped off the radar.\nThose talks commenced \u2014 with Weis excluded \u2014 under a memorandum of understanding that expired Jan. 31 last year, just after Salinas Valley Memorial sent its proposal."}
