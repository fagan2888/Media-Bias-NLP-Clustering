Senator Ted Cruz (R-Texas) took the Senate floor Thursday with a promise of repeal in 2017 after the Supreme Court ruled to uphold health care subsidies.

“I remain fully committed to repealing every single word of Obamacare. Mark my words, following the election in 2016, the referendum that we will have in 2017. This chamber will return and we will repeal every word of Obamacare,” the presidential candidate said.

The Texas senator promised to “pass common sense health care reform that makes health insurance personal and affordable, that keeps government from getting between us and our doctors.”

“We will recognize that this horrible experiment has failed: when millions of Americans lose their jobs, and are forced into part-time work, lose their health care, lose their doctors, and when millions of Americans see their premiums skyrocket. It’s incumbent on members of this body. It’s incumbent on the federal government to fix the wreckage they caused — to fix the wreckage that the Supreme Court has now embraced lawlessly,” he said.

Cruz ended his floor comments with a vow for the year following the presidential election.

“We will repeal ObamaCare, and I will fight with every breath in my body to make sure that happens in 2017,” Cruz closed his speech.
