Summerville won the meet with 649 points. Newberry was third with 384 points and Greenwood was fourth with 368 points.\n\nCoach Larry McMahan is excited about what the new season holds for the Piranhas.\n\n\u201cThis is a fairly young team,\u201d McMahan said. \u201cOut of 35 swimmers we only have one swimmer over the age of 13. Also for this meet, we had 11 brand new swimmers who just started on August 17. Our new swimmers are doing very well in such a short period of time. One swimmer just started on Sept. 14, and he was so excited that he wanted to swim in the meet and did well for his first meet.\u201d\n\nSix out of 11 new swimmers earned points in the meet. Molly Sanders, age 5 and a new swimmer, earned 13 points for the team, and Turner Repucci, age 6, earned 9 points.\n\n\u201cPickens County Y swimmers had a total of 46 new Personal Records,\u201d McMahan said. \u201cWe also had swimmers in a total of 42 first-time events, so hopefully the personal records will continue to climb. We are young and we made some mistakes. We had seven DQs (disqualifications). We will correct our mistakes and be better for our next meet when we will host Cherokee YMCA and Anderson YMCA on Oct. 31 here at Pickens.\u201d\n\nPickens will also travel to Columbia in December, and in January the team will travel to Columbia and Anderson.\n\nPickens County had three swimmers who earned all first places in their events and earned the maximum of 36 points each: Tamara Boysworth, 12; Ivy Hyder, 8; and Maddy McKever, 6.\n\nIvy Hyder cut the most time for female swimmers with a total of 69.04 seconds. Hyder improved 65.49 seconds in one event, the 200 freestyle. Aidan Wakefield, 9, cut the most time for male swimmers with a total of 21.53 seconds. Wakefield improved 16.38 seconds on his 50 butterfly event. Pickens had 12 swimmers who improved by 10 seconds or more.\n\nSwimmers ages 4-21 can join the Piranhas at any time.
