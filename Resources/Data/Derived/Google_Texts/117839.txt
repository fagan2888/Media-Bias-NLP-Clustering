The 114th Congress begins tomrorow and Rep. David Jolly, R-Indian Shores, says he'll introduce several bills.

- The Flood Insurance Premium Parity Act (FIPPA), which would extend the reforms of the federal flood insurance program to business properties and owner-occupied second homes, ensuring that these properties receive the same relief already provided to residential properties and single-family homes. FIPPA would resolve the unequal treatment of these properties under the Biggert-Waters Act.

- The Alternative Maximum Tax Act, which would create a maximum level of taxation that any one individual can be subjected to from all levels of government combined – federal, state, municipalities, and other taxing authorities. Under this legislation, no individual would be responsible for a level of personal taxation greater than 50% of their income, and Jolly’s commitment is to then work to significantly reduce that threshold.

- The Patient Freedom Act, which would repeal the Affordable Care Act’s individual mandate and restore the freedom of all Americans to decide what health care coverage is right for them and their family.

Jolly said he would also work on budget issues, "adding political candidates to the national Do Not Call Registry, protecting recreational fisherman from increasing government overreach, fighting for a full ‘choice card’ for all veterans to receive healthcare at facilities of their own choosing, reducing VA and Social Security Administration benefit application backlogs, strengthening the 1033 military surplus equipment program, and advancing research in areas related to melanoma, Alzheimer’s disease, and marine sciences."
