She now works part-time and her wages cover some bills, but the $186 in medication she spends per month is putting a strain on her pocketbook.\n\n\u201cWith co-pays being anywhere from $45 to $65 without insurance or Medicaid, it's difficult,\u201d says Herndon.\n\nHerndon is in the so-called \"Medicaid gap\" where she makes too much money to qualify for Medicaid, but not enough money to qualify for subsidized Obamacare coverage.\n\nThe proposed Medicaid expansion would take that gap away.\n\n\u201cYou're talking about individuals who do not have very many dollars to live on,\u201d says Robert Johnson, executive director of Region Ten in Charlottesville.\n\nJohnson says thousands of people in Charlottesville and Albemarle County would be eligible for health insurance if Medicaid expanded.\n\n\u201cSo it's quite a disappointment to have this not happen for our state,\u201d says Johnson.\n\nMany are wondering why this hasn\u2019t happened yet.\n\nRepublican Delegate Robert Bell says it would cost the state too much money.\n\n\u201cMedicaid has already expanded very substantially in the last few decades and in fact in the last 10 years spending on it has doubled,\u201d says Del. Bell, (R) 58th District. \u201cThe concern would be if we are going to have sort of very big cost drivers already in the program, we have to address those before adding more people.\u201d\n\nDelegate Bell explained that the state budget grows four percent each year, where Medicaid grows eight percent per year and already takes up 20 percent of the state's budget.\n\n\u201cI think expanding the program now and promising that we will reform it down the road just is not a good way to do this,\u201d says Del. Bell. \u201cThis has been growing for quite some time; it\u2019s coming.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe could see that it was coming for years and it's almost here, where we have to start to do something to reign in the cost of Medicaid program or else it's just unaffordable, it's not sustainable.\u201d\n\nGovernor Terry McAuliffe has been pushing for the expansion since 2014, when it was first introduced.\n\nLast year, the General Assembly rejected it, but this year the Governor once again spoke to lawmakers urging them to reconsider.\n\n\u201cWith one vote this session we can get healthcare for 400,000 of our fellow Virginians, create up to 30,000 new jobs and save our current budget $105 million,\u201d says Gov. McAuliffe.\n\n\u201cWe can't find a good reason not to expand Medicaid and that's why there is such disappointment about it,\u201d says Johnson.\n\nAs for Dornita Herndon, she hopes it gets sorted out, so she can go back to her doctor and lower the amount coming out of her pocket for medical expenses.\n\n\u201cIt's not just for me, but for everyone who needs medical attention, but can't afford it,\u201d says Herndon.\n\nGovernor McAuliffe is currently working on initiatives that will help nearly 25,000 Virginians with health insurance. However, he knows that an expansion will reach more people.\n\nNow it\u2019s up to lawmakers in Richmond to see if Medicaid expansion can fit in this year\u2019s budget.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "Right now Medicaid has not been expanded in Virginia, even though 400,000 people could receive health insurance because of it.
