Some applicants already had health-care coverage.\n\n\u201cFor these 10 applications, we were approved for subsidized coverage\u2014the premium tax credit, paid in advance, and cost sharing reduction subsidies\u2014for all cases,\u201d the agency said. While eight of the fake applicants failed to clear an initial identify checking step, after calling the marketplaces the applications were approved.\n\nThe agency also tested controls for eight fake applicants trying to get Medicaid coverage. These applicants either included invalid Social Security numbers, or they claimed they were noncitizens who declined to provide a Social Security number.\n\nSeven of the eight fictitious applicants were approved for subsidized health-care coverage and three were approved for Medicaid.\n\nLast year, Healthcare.gov did the same thing, approving coverage for fictitious accounts for the 2014 coverage year.\n\n\u201cCMS accepted fabricated documentation with these applications without attempting to verify its authenticity and enrolled fake applicants while handing out thousands of dollars in premium tax subsidies,\u201d said Sen. Orrin Hatch (R., Utah) at a hearing on July 16, 2015.\n\n\u201cNow a year later, GAO has reported that nothing has changed and that, if anything, there are more problems,\u201d he said. \u201cWorst of all, the administration has known about these problems for over a year now and has apparently not taken the necessary steps to rectify them.\u201d\n\nAfter these findings, congressional members requested continued oversight. The agency\u2019s most recent report evaluates the quality of enrollment controls for the 2015 coverage year.\n\nAn official with the Department of Health and Human Services pushed back against the agency\u2019s findings, pointing to the fact that the fake applications were initially blocked before being allowed to proceed, and questioning whether it was likely that Americans would attempt to defraud the government in the manner outlined in the report.\n\n\u201cThe Marketplaces, whether state-based or FFM [Federally Facilitated Marketplace], have a multi-layer verification process for applications, including checking identity and eligibility in real-time using the Data Services Hub and trusted sources\u2014safeguards that blocked the GAO investigators\u2019 initial attempts to enroll,\u201d said Meaghan Smith, an official at the department. \u201cIt\u2019s important to consider whether it\u2019s likely that uninsured Americans would replicate the next actions the GAO took, namely knowingly and willfully providing false information in violation of federal law, which could subject the individual to up to a $250,000 fine.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt seems unlikely that many uninsured Americans, many of whom have less than $100 in savings, would choose to commit perjury in order to pay the premiums and deductibles for two insurance policies or to pay premiums for marketplace insurance when eligible for Medicaid,\u201d she said. \u201cIn addition, the ACA\u2019s design reduces the incentive for individuals to lie on their application because financial assistance is paid directly to the issuer, so an individual cannot directly profit.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen we are provided with information that we can use to improve the Marketplace, we take action,\u201d said Smith. \u201cThat\u2019s why we have repeatedly requested and remain disappointed to still not receive from the GAO specific details and recommendations relating to their fraudulent applications to enable us to analyze and understand what occurred and whether we can make improvements to our processes or procedures.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "Healthcare.gov approved subsidized coverage in 2015 for 10 fictitious applicants in another Government Accountability Office (GAO) sting, according to a report from the investigative agency.
