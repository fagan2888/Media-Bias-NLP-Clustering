But Democrats shouldn't be too quick to view the survey as unvarnished good news.\n\nHere are four reasons why.\n\nMillennials Are Less Attached To The Democratic Party Label\n\nWhile Pew characterizes the millennials as \"strikingly Democratic\" in the last two presidential elections, they are nevertheless more likely than previous generations to reject party labels. Half of millennials \u2014 up from 38 percent in 2004 \u2014 identify themselves as political independents, meaning both parties have lost ground among young people.\n\nMillennials Are No More Liberal On Gun Control And Abortion\n\n\n\nOf all the age groups, millennials are the most supportive of same-sex marriage, the legalization of marijuana, and a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants by a wide margin. But their views on gun control and abortion are no more liberal than previous generations that Pew studied. Forty-nine percent of millennials say it's more important to protect gun rights than control gun ownership, a figure that is roughly at par with the attitudes of older generations. And 56 percent say abortion should be legal in all cases \u2014 slightly less than among Generation X, which is defined as Americans born between 1965 and 1980. Millennials are also much less likely to consider themselves environmentalists than any other generation.\n\nFewer Millennials See Big Differences Between The Parties\n\n\n\nJust 31 percent of millennials say there is a great deal of difference between the Republican and Democratic parties. That's considerably less than among other generations: By comparison, 58 percent of the so-called Silent Generation (those born between 1928 to 1945) believe there are big differences between the parties.\n\nMillennials Are As Skeptical Of Obamacare As Older Generations\n\n\n\nEven though millennials support universal health insurance by the widest margin of any generation \u2014 and are far more supportive of President Obama than older generations \u2014 their attitude toward the Affordable Care Act is just as negative as older generations: only about four in 10 in each generation approved of the law.", "article_metadata": {"Rating": "General", "description": "A new survey of Americans aged 18 to 32 includes some troubling news for the GOP.
