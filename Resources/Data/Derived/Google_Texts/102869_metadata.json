The findings, presented by the United Nations (UN) during the 2015 Joint Statistical Meetings in Seattle on Monday, identified Africa as the main propeller of the record-breaking population.\n\nJohn Wilmoth, director of the UN's population division, told the audience as he presented the findings that the projection was based on population patterns throughout human history. Currently, there are 7.3 billion humans scattered throughout the world, and in 2050, UN statisticians estimate the population will climb to 9.7 billion. By 2100, it's possible the world will reach a total of 11.2 billion.\n\nWilmoth and his team took a closer look at population trends to figure out what was driving the high rates of growth, finding their answer in Africa. Today, the continent\u2019s population remains at 1.2 billion, but not for long. It\u2019s expected to increase to 5.6 billion by the end of this century, thanks to higher rates of fertility, which have steadily improved over the last decade.\n\nIt appears declining fertility rates that have long plagued countries like Nigeria, Africa\u2019s most populous country, have stalled. As a result, Nigeria's fertility rate is expected to grow. In a country where there are 182 million Nigerians, the UN projects the country will eventually lead to a population of 752 million in the next 85 years.\n\nThere is still a significant amount of uncertainty attached to the numbers, but Wilmoth said there is a 90 percent chance Nigeria\u2019s population will exceed 439 million people by 2100. That\u2019s nearly 2.5 times its current size. It\u2019s not just Nigeria that is expected to significantly grow, but also Somalia, Niger, Gambia, and Angola among others.\n\nA recent analysis by demographers may explain why the continent\u2019s growing at an alarming rate. The government\u2019s encouragement of family planning has led to a \u201cyouth bulge\u201d of healthy, growing children. In 2010, the UN conducted a census to project worldwide population, and they incorrectly estimated fertility rates of about 17 African countries. Their fertility rates were and have since been higher since the census report.\n\nWilmoth warns that the rapid population growth in high-fertility countries may worsen existing problems, including scarce resources, pollution, education, maternity care, political unrest, crime, poverty, and employment. It would cost about $1.5 billion a year to provide modern contraceptives to all African women between the ages of 15 and 49 who are currently unprotected, and unless a system is put into play, the population growth is inevitable.\n\nThe UN hopes the findings can encourage countries to begin investing in areas where they\u2019re lacking, like setting up proper health care and infrastructure to support the billions of citizens living there.\n\nSource: Wilmoth J.
