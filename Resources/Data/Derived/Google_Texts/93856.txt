Ted Cruz spoke for more than 30 minutes at his rally in Evansville. But before he spoke to the crowd, he sat down one-on-one with Eyewitness News' Tina Stein.

Here's a transcript of the interview:

Tina Stein:

"Five states have primaries on Tuesday. Why are you in Indiana?

Ted Cruz:

"The entire nation is focused on Indiana. It's a battleground. Donald Trump and I are effectively tied in this state and Indiana is going to have a choice to impact not only the direction of the Republican Party, but the direction of the country. My number one priority as president is bringing back jobs and economic growth."

Tina Stein:

"Speaking of jobs, the area has lost a lot of jobs in the aluminum industry. Alcoa just shut down the Warrick smelter. Hundreds of people have lost their jobs. A big reason for that is because of China. How do you think that situation should be handled?"

Ted Cruz:

"The last seven years, we've gotten hammered by the Clinton-Obama economy. It hasn't been working. My number one priority as president is jobs and economic growth, and the key to jobs is small businesses. Two-thirds of all new jobs come from small businesses, so if I'm elected president, we'll repeal every single word of Obamacare. We'll pass a simple flat tax and abolish the IRS. We will reign in the regulators that are killing jobs and driving them oversees. We'll reign in the EPA and stop amnesty and sanctuary cities."

Tina Stein:

"What can be done, though, to stop China from importing aluminum?"

Ted Cruz:

"If you look at what China is doing right now, this administration's policies are driving jobs to China. Obamacare: it's the biggest job killer in America. So, jobs go oversees to escape Obamacare."

Tina Stein:

"Indiana selected its delegates a couple of weeks ago. And John Kasich is saying he has it locked up. What is your response to that statement and the entire process in the way delegates are selected?"



Ted Cruz:

"This is about elections. The people decide. I am hopeful and confident we're going to do well here in Indiana. We are working to earn the votes of the men and women of this state. John Kasich is a good and honorable man, but he has no path whatsoever to winning the nomination. He's lost over 30 states in a row."

Tina Stein:

"I covered the Donald Trump rally in Louisville and he talked a lot about Carrier, and that's something we've heard throughout the campaign. That's something that resonates with voters because it's specific. Is there a specific issue that you think people need to be upset about and something should be done to change it?"

Ted Cruz:

"Carrier is a good example where Donald Trump and my approach are very different."

Tina Stein:

What is your approach?

Ted Cruz:

Donald's approach is just like Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama's. 'I'm going to punish Carrier.' And that's the approach of a big government liberal. My approach is very different. My approach is the same approach Ronald Reagan and JFK both had. They understand if you cut taxes, if you lift regulations, you'll see millions and millions of new jobs."
