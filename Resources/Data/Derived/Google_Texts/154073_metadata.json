And we can get the same kind of results with the same kind of Congress,\u201d he said.\n\nGreenleaf criticized U.S. House Rep. Joe Wilson for voting against the Violence Against Women Act, for not supporting veterans and for standing lock-step with fellow Republicans in \u201cshutting down the federal government than sit down and hammer out a budget agreement.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have a congressman who wraps himself in conservative cloth, and yet has let our nation\u2019s debt grow from $5.8 trillion to $17.2 trillion under his watchful eye,\u201d Greenleaf said.\n\nGreenleaf told those gathered that he would not vote on a budget that would increase the annual deficit from the previous year and that he would put focus on taking care of veterans and soldiers.\n\nThe 51-year-old is running against Wilson, a Republican who has held the District 2 seat for the past 13 years. The district includes Richland, Lexington, Aiken, Barnwell and Orangeburg counties.\n\nGreenleaf comes on the scene as a relative unknown, but he possesses a significant fiscal pedigree. He graduated from the University of South Carolina with a bachelor\u2019s degree in economics and a master\u2019s degree in public administration. He has spent the past 27 years working for Blue Cross Blue Shield.\n\nGreenleaf retired last week from Blue Cross Blue Shield of South Carolina where he focused on outreach education and communication to focus on campaigning full time.\n\nHe said he was led to run for political office for the first time after watching how Congress has handled the budget process in the last session.\n\n\u201cThis past government shutdown struck me as troublesome,\u201d he said.\n\nHe described the cohort on Capitol Hill that refuses to fund the budget as \u201cmiddle aged white men\u201d who have used the Affordable Care Act to shutdown the government.\n\n\u201cOur country\u2019s being held hostage,\u201d he said.\n\nGreenleaf said Washington needs someone who can sit down and work out issues with others to develop solutions.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a ramrod kind of guy,\u201d he said.\n\nGreenleaf, who is openly gay, said his orientation would not factor into how he would approach issues important to constituents. He said it might be \u201ca novelty to some\u201d but that residents are more concerned about what he plans to do with jobs, the economy and the gridlock in Washington.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not into labels,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fact that I\u2019m gay is just as important as me being right-handed.\u201d\n\nComments", "article_metadata": {"description": "Cola Daily is your source for free local news and information in Columbia and the Midlands.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.3", "og": {"site_name": "ColaDaily.com", "description": "Cola Daily is your source for free local news and information in Columbia and the Midlands.", "title": "Ed Greenleaf launches campaign for U.S. House seat on promise to put constituents first - ColaDaily.com", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://coladaily.com/files/2014/02/DSCN7935.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-02-27T08:51:03+00:00", "url": "http://coladaily.com/2014/02/26/ed-greenleaf-launches-campaign-for-u-s-house-seat-on-promise-to-put-constituents-first/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Cola Daily is your source for free local news and information in Columbia and the Midlands.", "creator": "@coladaily", "image": "http://coladaily.com/files/2014/02/DSCN7935.jpg", "title": "Ed Greenleaf launches campaign for U.S. House seat on promise to put constituents first - ColaDaily.com", "site": "@coladaily", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": "100009199284505,<head>", "app_id": 1620331954920091}, "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/ColaDaily", "section": "Elections", "published_time": "2014-02-26T00:04:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-02-27T08:51:03+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd4095\"", "article_summary": "Richland County resident Ed Greenleaf told supporters at a Tuesday campaign launch event that U.S. House District 2 deserves a congressman who would create jobs and put constituents first.\nThe 51-year-old is running against Wilson, a Republican who has held the District 2 seat for the past 13 years.\nGreenleaf retired last week from Blue Cross Blue Shield of South Carolina where he focused on outreach education and communication to focus on campaigning full time.\nGreenleaf, who is openly gay, said his orientation would not factor into how he would approach issues important to constituents.\nAnd we can get the same kind of results with the same kind of Congress,\u201d he said."}
