Irran’s Supreme leader Ali Khamenei called for “Death to America” on Saturday, a day after President Barack Obama appealed to Iran to seize a “historic opportunity” for a nuclear deal and a better future, and as US Secretary of State John Kerry claimed substantial progress toward an accord.

Nothing could better sum up the delusional nature President Obama’s quest to substitute Iran for Israel as our ally in the Middle East than a speech given yesterday by Ayatollah Khameni, the Supreme Leader of Iran. The Times of Israel reports:

This is insanity of a high order. Or else a malign plan.

This should be the banner headline in every newspaper in the United States, and lead every newscast. The President of the United States is pursuing a policy to hand legitimacy to the nuclear weapons program of an enemy whose real leader brazenly in public calls for death to America, while giving the economies of the West permission to end the economic sanctions that are the only hope, short of war, to halt the program aimed at provoking Armageddon.

Khamenei’s comments contrasted with those of Iranian President Hassan Rohani, who said “achieving a deal is possible” by the March 31 target date for a preliminary accord.

Meanwhile, the relatively powerless political front man in Iran plays the good cop:

Khamenei told a crowd in Tehran that Iran would not capitulate to Western demands. When the crowd started shouting, “Death to America,” the ayatollah responded: “Of course yes, death to America, because America is the original source of this pressure.
