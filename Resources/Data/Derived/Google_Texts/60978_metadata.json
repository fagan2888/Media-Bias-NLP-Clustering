While the president\u2019s action was applauded by many Democrats who saw it as a way around congressional gridlock on immigration reform, Republicans have opposed it and accused Obama of exceeding the powers granted to the executive branch in the Constitution.\n\nFreshman Republican Carlos Curbelo of Florida, one of a handful of supporters of comprehensive immigration reform in the Republican caucus, told The Daily Beast that while he would have to see the lawsuit, that \u201cif it\u2019s very specific in seeking to hold the Obama Administration for violating the Constitution, I could support it.\u201d In his opinion, it needed to be \u201ca question of the Constitution not of the policy goals advanced through the actions.\u201d But, while Curbelo noted the lawsuit was not \u201cunimportant, he was more concerned about \u201can ultimate solution\u2026a series of bills that will address all of our immigration challenges\u201d\n\nGOP immigration reform advocate Mario Diaz-Balart echoed his fellow Floridian. While Diaz-Balart, like Curbelo, said he believes the solution was for the House to pass legislation, he likened the situation to that faced by Congress after former Rep. Bill Jefferson was found with $90,000 in his freezer nearly a decade ago. The House of Representatives at the time reached a bipartisan consensus to sue the government after the Department of Justice searched the corrupt congressman\u2019s office in violation of Article I, Section 6 of the Constitution. As Diaz-Balart pointed out, while everyone found defending the unsavory Jefferson to be politically crazy, it \u201cwas an issue of Constitution and law.\u201d He did see a policy crossover between the lawsuit and immigration reform, noting \u201cit\u2019s all interrelated\u201d and \u201cyou can\u2019t just remove the issue out of it.\u201d He nevertheless thinks the best way for the House to deal with the matter was by actually passing legislation.\n\nThe potential for a lawsuit comes just as the Senate is about to consider an appropriations bill for the Department of Homeland Security, passed by the House, which would defund the Obama Administration\u2019s executive orders on immigration. Every Democrat in the Senate has indicated that he or she would oppose such a bill, which means that barring a compromise, this crucial cabinet department would be shut down at the end of February. A lawsuit might be a compromise to enable House Republicans to fund the DHS while still opposing the president\u2019s actions.", "article_metadata": {"content-type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "pageNum": 1, "description": "The speaker\u2019s plan to sue Obama over his immigration executive action may capture support of even those lawmakers who back reform.", "title": "Boehners Canny Immigration Gambit", "resourceType": "dailybeast2/components/pages/article", "contentpath": "/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/01/28/boehner-s-canny-immigration-gambit", "twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "bencjacobs"}, "sectionTaxanomies": "politics", "environment": "dev", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Beast", "description": "The speaker\u2019s plan to sue Obama over his immigration executive action may capture support of even those lawmakers who back reform.", "title": "Boehner\u2019s Canny Immigration Gambit", "url": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/01/28/boehner-s-canny-immigration-gambit.html", "image": "http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/01/28/boehner-s-canny-immigration-gambit/jcr:content/image.img.2000.jpg/1422441956345.cached.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": "1703087,30000737,1117577220,1276800108,931159,514915512", "app_id": 189930913679}, "authorIds": "/etc/authors/b/ben-jacobs", "platform": "desktop", "template": "article", "authors": "Ben Jacobs", "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/politics", "article": {"published_time": "2015-01-28T10:21:00.000Z", "author": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/contributors/ben-jacobshtml"}, "type": "house", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"Boehner\u2019s Canny Immigration Gambit\",\"link\":\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/01/28/boehner-s-canny-immigration-gambit.html\",\"image_url\":\"http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/01/28/boehner-s-canny-immigration-gambit/jcr:content/image.crop.410.273.jpg/47414731.cached.jpg\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":\"/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/01/28/boehner-s-canny-immigration-gambit\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-01-28T10:21:00+00:00\",\"section\":\"Politics\",\"author\":\"Ben Jacobs\",\"tags\":[]}", "publicationDate": 201501281021}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce58b\"", "article_summary": "Even Republican supporters of immigration reform aren\u2019t inherently opposed to a potential congressional lawsuit against the Obama Administration over the president\u2019s executive action on immigration.\nLawsuit PoliticsThe speaker\u2019s plan to sue Obama over his immigration executive action may capture support of even those lawmakers who back reform.\nA lawsuit might be a compromise to enable House Republicans to fund the DHS while still opposing the president\u2019s actions.\nWhile the president\u2019s action was applauded by many Democrats who saw it as a way around congressional gridlock on immigration reform, Republicans have opposed it and accused Obama of exceeding the powers granted to the executive branch in the Constitution.\nThe potential for a lawsuit comes just as the Senate is about to consider an appropriations bill for the Department of Homeland Security, passed by the House, which would defund the Obama Administration\u2019s executive orders on immigration."}
