He told reporters in Michigan yesterday why he wasn\u2019t getting into a lot of specifics at the moment.\n\nI think you\u2019re gonna see lots of plans and you\u2019re gonna see\u2014also and you have to understand, when you\u2019re coming up with a plan in business you have to be flexible. There\u2019s got to be flexibility\u2026if I would have sat down and said, \u2018Here\u2019s a 12 point plan to get Dural,\u201d I didn\u2019t do that. I went in and punched and punched and beat the hell out of people, and I ended up getting it\u2026you have to be able to have flexibility, you have to be able to do certain things.\n\nHe\u2019s right and wrong about this. It\u2019s true political leaders need to be flexible, especially when it comes to negotiations on the budget. But it all depends on where the flexibility lies. If a leader sits there and promises not to raise taxes, then raises taxes to avoid massive spending cuts, what is he called? A one-term president. What do you call a governor who promised he was against Obamacare, then decides to expand Medicaid? The current Ohio governor (and presidential candidate). What do you call the ex-governor who supported Common Core before saying he didn\u2019t support the federal government\u2019s involvement in education? The \u201cfront-runner\u201d behind Trump.\n\nThis is why it\u2019s important for political leaders to decide where they\u2019re going to be flexible. There are certain stances political leaders can not back away from if they claim to want to get the government out of people\u2019s lives or save taxpayer money. This isn\u2019t a discussion about a 12% tax cut versus a 7% cut. This is a fight between a 2% tax cut and a 1% tax HIKE. This is saying, \u201cOkay you want to raise military spending? Fine\u2026cut spending here and here to balance it out.\u201d This is cutting regulations and resisting calls for new ones.\n\nSo what does Trump believe? He\u2019s in favor of building a wall along the Mexican border, and wants Mexico to pay for it (somehow). Trump wants to \u201ctake the oil, knock the hell out of them\u201d when it comes to ISIS, but doesn\u2019t say if that involves bombs or troops. He wants to simplify the tax code, but hasn\u2019t said what he believes in. Trump wants to replace Obamacare with \u201csomething terrific,\u201d but then discusses some form of single payer for those who need help and eliminating state lines for those who don\u2019t. Trump also calls U.S. leaders stupid, but doesn\u2019t say what policies he\u2019d use for China and Russia. He needs to start providing more specifics outside of his campaign slogan and rhetoric. Matt Lewis at The Daily Caller picks up on this too.\n\nYou just have to trust that \u2014 because he is brilliant and successful (and because the current establishment politicians are stupid and corrupt) \u2014 he will magically solve all our problems. Even his slogan, \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d evokes a sort of nostalgia that has been used by strongmen throughout the ages to hearken back to some magical time when all was right with the world \u2014 before the people in power sold us out and betrayed us.\n\nTrump needs to explain his stances on entitlement reform, how he would cut regulations, how he would make education local (although he suggested cutting the Department of Education), and what he\u2019d do about justice reform. These are all policy stances which do need a plan that\u2019s more than a slogan or telling people what they want to hear, even if he doesn\u2019t publicly talk about it.\n\nTrump isn\u2019t the only politician to not have detailed plans on the issues. Jeb Bush, Scott Walker, and Carly Fiorina don\u2019t have issues pages on their websites. Ted Cruz talks about his track record, but that\u2019s about it. Ben Carson, Marco Rubio, and Rand Paul do have an issues section, but Paul\u2019s seems to be the most detailed and wonkish. But all the candidates provided specifics during last week\u2019s presidential debate. Trump didn\u2019t. One reason candidates talk in generalities is so they don\u2019t necessarily have to be held accountable if their promises go awry (see George H.W. Bush). But at some point they\u2019ll have to explain their positions further. By being nebulous and relying on slogans, Trump can stay tapped in on the anger he\u2019s feeding off of. He can stay populist and hope being the \u201csmartest man of the people\u201d will get him wherever he\u2019s going (whether it\u2019s the White House or a new reality show somewhere). If President Barack Obama was able to get into the White House on \u201cHope and Change\u201d maybe Trump can run on \u201cAmerica and Anger.\u201d But even Obama released an outline of what he wanted to do in 2008. This isn\u2019t proclaiming the death of Trump\u2019s candidacy, but it is pointing out what he\u2019ll have to do if he wants to avoid becoming the next Williams Jennings Bryan or Ross Perot.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Flexible.", "title": "Trump promises detailed issue stances soon", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2015/08/13/trump-promises-detailed-issue-stances-soon/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@allahpundit"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-13T12:01:26+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-12T22:19:36+00:00"}, "keywords": "2016 election, populism, trump, trump-ism,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd40d\"", "article_summary": "Trump promises detailed issue stances soonposted at 8:01 am on August 13, 2015 by Taylor MillardDonald Trump is promising he\u2019s going to release detailed policy stances soon.\nThis is a fight between a 2% tax cut and a 1% tax HIKE.\nThis isn\u2019t a discussion about a 12% tax cut versus a 7% cut.\nTrump wants to \u201ctake the oil, knock the hell out of them\u201d when it comes to ISIS, but doesn\u2019t say if that involves bombs or troops.\nTrump wants to replace Obamacare with \u201csomething terrific,\u201d but then discusses some form of single payer for those who need help and eliminating state lines for those who don\u2019t."}
