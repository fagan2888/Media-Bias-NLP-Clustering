The Ingham County Health Plan was created in 1998 to help the regionâ€™s most vulnerable residents help pay for medical care. At one time, the program served around 14,000 people. But after the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, many of those people became eligible for insurance, either through the expanded Medicaid program or the private insurance market. That means that the yearly $3.2 million dollar millage for the program that voters renewed last fall is supporting a much smaller program.

The Ingham County Board of Commissioners has been hearing proposals for other ways the County could spend money originally intended for the Ingham Health Plan.

Current State talks about how the program is changing and what its future might look with Dr. Dean Sienko, Vice President of the Board of Directors for the Ingham Health Plan, and Ingham County Commissioner Deb Nolan. She's vice chairperson of the Commission's Human Services Committee.
