The law is aimed at extending a deadline that\u2019s already passed.\n\nMichael Pope reports.\n\nIn the original form of the Affordable Care Act, states had until 2014 to expand Medicaid health insurance for those who live in poverty or with disabilities. That wasn\u2019t intended to be a punitive deadline because every state was supposed to expand Medicaid - until the Supreme Court stepped in and gave the states and ability to opt out.\n\nVirginia, along with 18 other states, decided against participating. That means they\u2019ve missed the deadline for receiving three years of 100 percent reimbursement.\n\n\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t have to pay the price of the legislature\u2019s reluctance,\" says Democratic Senator Mark Warner. He\u2019s joining with Democratic Senator Tim Kaine and a half dozen other senators to extend the deadline for expanding Medicaid. \u201cI hope this will get rid of one other excuse that the legislature has in terms of not taking advantage of what is both a good business decision but what it also the right moral choice.\"\n\nUnder the legislation introduced this week, states would get three years of full reimbursement whenever they sign up, although Virginia\u2019s Republican-led General Assembly is showing no signs of changing its mind anytime soon.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Government & Politics", "description": "In Washington, Virginia\u2019s two senators are joining forces along with half a dozen other senators to help encourage states to expand Medicaid coverage under", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://wvtf.org/post/va-lawmakers-support-states-achieve-medicaid-expansion-legislation", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/wvtf/files/styles/medium/public/201401/medicaid-funding-cuts.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "In Washington, Virginia\u2019s two senators are joining forces along with half a dozen other senators to help encourage states to expand Medicaid coverage under", "title": "VA Lawmakers Support \"States Achieve Medicaid Expansion\" Legislation"}, "org_id": 0, "twitter": {"site": "@@WVTFRADIOIQ", "card": "summary"}, "author": "Michael Pope", "wordCount": 274, "dc": {"title": "VA Lawmakers Support &quot;States Achieve Medicaid Expansion&quot; Legislation"}, "nid": 52547, "datePublished": "2016-04-15", "story_id": 474414159, "keywords": "Medicare and Medicaid, Health Insurance, Federal Government", "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "He\u2019s joining with Democratic Senator Tim Kaine and a half dozen other senators to extend the deadline for expanding Medicaid.\nIn the original form of the Affordable Care Act, states had until 2014 to expand Medicaid health insurance for those who live in poverty or with disabilities.\nIn Washington, Virginia\u2019s two senators are joining forces along with half a dozen other senators to help encourage states to expand Medicaid coverage under the Affordable Care Act.\nThat wasn\u2019t intended to be a punitive deadline because every state was supposed to expand Medicaid - until the Supreme Court stepped in and gave the states and ability to opt out.\nUnder the legislation introduced this week, states would get three years of full reimbursement whenever they sign up, although Virginia\u2019s Republican-led General Assembly is showing no signs of changing its mind anytime soon."}
