Without getting a dentist or orthodontist involved, he printed his own 3D braces to straighten his top teeth, and is currently on his last set of braces after 16 weeks of self-dentistry.\n\nHere\u2019s how he made this happen: He scanned and printed models of his own teeth, then molded a set of 12 clear braces from the tooth models, Fox13Now reported. Then, he determined how far he needed to move each top tooth to correct crookedness, and divided that by the maximum recommended distance a tooth should travel.\n\n\u201cIt was very obvious which tooth [the tray] was putting pressure on,\u201d Dudley told local media. \u201cI was sort of worried about accumulated error, but that wasn\u2019t the case so that was a pretty glorious moment.\u201d\n\nDudley was clearly playing to his strengths when designing his own smile saver.\n\n\u201cIt makes me feel sort of silly for not being able to figure out how to charge my cordless water flosser,\u201d one young man about Dudley\u2019s age from Boston told LifeZette.\n\n\"I guess that\u2019s why I\u2019m in finance \u2014 I\u2019ll leave the dentistry to the professionals. Good for him, though. Braces are crazy expensive!\"\n\nDudley was trying to avoid paying $8,000 for a set of clear braces from a name brand, Fox13Now noted. His homemade braces cost $60 total.\n\nBraces cost about $5,000 per child, notes mykidshealth.org, and even if your family has insurance, that insurance may not cover much of the bill.\n\nFor children, dental insurance for braces may be required in some states, but this does not cover every need, notes ehealthinsurance.com. Braces may be covered, for example, if they are necessary to improve a child\u2019s ability to chew food properly.\n\nRelated Content HealthZette Why the Eyes (and Teeth) Have It Researchers may be on the cusp of curing corneal vision loss\n\nObamacare \u2014 or the Affordable Care Act \u2014 does not require insurance companies to offer dental insurance for adults. Dental insurance plans may cover orthodontics for adults, but if the treatment is desired for purely cosmetic reasons it is usually not covered.\n\n3D printing and dentistry are already aligned. Industrial-grade 3D printers and materials are being made to cater specifically to the dentistry market, and dental labs around the globe have already introduced these technologies into their workflow.\n\nThey use 3D printers to create teeth and gum models, as well as dental implants such as crowns, caps, bridges, and dentures. Surgical tools such as drill guides can also be 3D-printed, according to 3D Printing in Dentistry 2015: A Ten-Year Opportunity Forecast and Analysis by SmarTech, a technology innovation publisher.\n\nDudley told Fox13Now he\u2019s already gotten requests from others to print braces for them \u2014 but he\u2019s not going that route due to possible liability issues.\n\n\"I\u2019m not interested in orthodontics,\" he told the station. \"It was more of a hacker project than making a business out of this.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "Many millennials are ceaselessly creative when it comes to new technology, but one east coast student has taken tech innovations to a whole new level.
