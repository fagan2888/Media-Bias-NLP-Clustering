Its outreach efforts will focus on Door, Kewaunee, Manitowoc, Ozaukee and Sheboygan counties.\n\nNorthwest Wisconsin Concentrated Employment Program Inc., based in Ashland, will provide services in 18 job centers.\n\nThe grants last year made only a limited contribution to the work in helping people understand the Affordable Care Act and how to enroll for coverage.\n\nMuch of the work in the state instead was done by regional enrollment networks.
