And the IRS has the ability to see how long it takes to file a return from start to finish online, so ones that are completed too quickly will be flagged, because it could indicate an automated program.\n\nSEE ALSO: Hillary Clinton increases lead over Bernie Sanders in post-debate poll\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re breaking new ground in the battle against stolen identity refund fraud,\u201d Mr. Koskinen said.\n\nThe IRS earlier this year acknowledged hackers managed to steal data on some 330,000 households from agency files, and tried to get at nearly 400,000 others. The hackers used personal information already available online to circumvent checks designed to verify someone\u2019s authenticity in the IRS\u2019s \u201cGet Transcript\u201d application, which gives taxpayers access to their own files.\n\nBy successfully impersonating a taxpayer, the thieves were able to gain access to their files, get even more personal information about them, and in thousands of cases to file amended returns claiming bogus refunds \u2014 a portion of the billions of dollars of fraudulent refunds the IRS pays each year.\n\nSEE ALSO: Obama vows to veto sanctuary city crackdown\n\n\u201cWe are taking new steps upfront to protect taxpayers at the time they file and beyond,\u201d Mr. Koskinen said. \u201cThanks to the cooperative efforts taking place between the industry, the states and the IRS, we will have new tools in place this January to protect taxpayers during the 2016 filing season.\u201d\n\nWhile private sector corporations have largely implemented security measures on their own before now, Mr. Koskinen said software companies, such as TurboTax, the nation\u2019s top third-party processor, are adopting new \u201cidentity requirements and validation procedures\u201d across the board.\n\nBrad Smith, Intuit\u2019s CEO, called the new measures \u201cessential and unprecedented.\u201d\n\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019re creating new ways to further validate taxpayers\u2019 identities and the information they submit. Sharing what we\u2019ve learned will strengthen the system and give taxpayers greater confidence when they file returns,\u201d Mr. Smith said in a statement.\n\nBut while some within the tax-preparation industry applauded the announcement, other said more needs to be done.\n\n\u201cEliminating fraud from the tax preparation industry cannot be accomplished in a few months \u2014 this is a multi-year effort,\u201d said Bill Cobb, president and CEO of H&R Block. \u201cI applaud Commissioner Koskinen for his leadership of the multiple IRS working groups, which have produced actionable plans that will make a difference. But this is not enough. There is much more to do.\u201d\n\nShane MacDougall worked for Intuit until he resigned as principal security engineer in February. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that month, Mr. MacDougall said his former employer \u201csystematically prioritized profits over ethics when it came to its processing of fraudulent tax filings,\u201d and had repeatedly rebuffed his efforts to address the issue.\n\n\u201cI absolutely think that the tax industry already has made massive changes as a result of our complaint,\u201d Mr. MacDougall told the Washington Times on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cNow that the industry has been called out and the public is aware of how they\u2019ve been making money off fraud, they\u2019re not going to stand for it,\u201d he said. \u201cI think now that it\u2019s been exposed for all to see, the industry and the IRS had to take steps to solve it.\u201d According to Mr. MacDougall, much of the government\u2019s advice has already been implemented for several years. But by making them mandatory, he told The Times, he expects \u201cit will reduce the amount of fraud that companies are going to allow to fly under the IRS\u2018 radar.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe industry in general has the tools it needs to cut down on fraud,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they want to stop it, they can stop it.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, the former Intuit security engineer cautioned that Americans should be wary regardless of handing over their personal information to anyone other than the IRS directly. \u201cI\u2019d still recommend people file by paper and not use online filing,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Stung by an embarrassing cyber fraud operation this year, the IRS vowed Tuesday to cut down on tax refund identity theft in 2016 with a series of new checks designed to weed out increasing sophisticated crimes.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Stung by an embarrassing cyber fraud operation this year, the IRS vowed Tuesday to cut down on tax refund identity theft in 2016 with a series of new checks designed to weed out increasing sophisticated crimes.", "title": "IRS vows to cut ID fraud in 2016 filing season", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/oct/20/irs-vows-cut-id-fraud-2016-filing-season/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/06/02/IRS_Data_Breach.JPEG-0174f.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/06/02/IRS_Data_Breach.JPEG-0174f.jpg", "description": "Stung by an embarrassing cyber fraud operation this year, the IRS vowed Tuesday to cut down on tax refund identity theft in 2016 with a series of new checks designed to weed out increasing sophisticat", "card": "summary", "title": "IRS vows to cut ID fraud in 2016 filing season"}, "Author": "Stephen Dinan", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Business Finance, Internal Revenue Service"}, "article_summary": "SEE ALSO: Hillary Clinton increases lead over Bernie Sanders in post-debate poll\u201cWe\u2019re breaking new ground in the battle against stolen identity refund fraud,\u201d Mr. Koskinen said.\n\u201cI absolutely think that the tax industry already has made massive changes as a result of our complaint,\u201d Mr. MacDougall told the Washington Times on Tuesday.\nSEE ALSO: Obama vows to veto sanctuary city crackdown\u201cWe are taking new steps upfront to protect taxpayers at the time they file and beyond,\u201d Mr. Koskinen said.\n\u201cI\u2019d still recommend people file by paper and not use online filing,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI applaud Commissioner Koskinen for his leadership of the multiple IRS working groups, which have produced actionable plans that will make a difference."}
