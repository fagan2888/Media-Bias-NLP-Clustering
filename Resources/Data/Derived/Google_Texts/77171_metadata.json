The DeCosters have also admitted that their Quality Egg company \u201cknowingly shipped eggs\u201d that had falsified expiration dates to make them appear to be fresher than they actually were.\n\nThat contributed to a salmonella outbreak that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates may have affected up to 56,000 Americans, leading to an unprecedented recall of 550 million eggs. When FDA investigators examined the DeCosters\u2019 rural Iowa farms in 2010, they found evidence of unsanitary conditions \u2014 including dead chickens, infestations of flies, and piles of manure \u2014 to suggest that the company was previously aware of potential food safety risks at their properties.\n\nNow, a judge has sentenced the pair to three months in jail, an outcome that food safety advocates weren\u2019t necessarily counting on. A sentence of imprisonment is not very common in cases against large food manufacturers. Bill Marler, an acclaimed food safety lawyer whose firm represented a group of more than 100 people who were sickened in the salmonella outbreak, said before the sentence was announced that he \u201cwouldn\u2019t be surprised\u201d if the DeCosters didn\u2019t get any jail time.\n\nSo the fact that one of the biggest food safety cases in recent history resulted in this punishment \u2014 which comes in addition to a $6.8 million fine for the Quality Egg company and $100,000 individual fines for each of the DeCosters \u2014 marks a victory for the consumer watchdogs who have been pushing for more oversight of big food corporations.\n\n\u201cA sentence of imprisonment is a fairly significant sentence in a case like this,\u201d Peter Deegan, the assistant U.S. attorney who prosecuted the case against the egg executives, told the Associated Press.\n\nFood safety officials have historically struggled to keep tabs on a sprawling food industry whose activities span across more than a dozen regulatory offices. About 48 million people fall ill after eating contaminated food every year, and the rate of foodborne illnesses has remained largely unchanged in recent years, despite efforts to reduce contamination.\n\nIn 2011, President Obama approved the first overhaul of food safety laws in 70 years with the Food Safety Modernization Act, which aims to expand the FDA\u2019s power to recall tainted products. But Congress hasn\u2019t fully funded that initiative, leaving food safety advocates concerned that the agency isn\u2019t well-enough prepared to prevent future outbreaks. Without more investment on the prevention side, advocates are left hoping that at least there might be some consequences if something does go wrong.\n\nAnd in recent years, several high-profile outbreaks of foodborne illnesses have resulted in legal action. In 2014, two cantaloupe farmers in Colorado were convicted for their role in a listeria outbreak that spanned 28 states and killed 33 people (although they didn\u2019t get any jail time). The executives of the now-defunct Peanut Corporation of America, which sparked the largest food recall in U.S. history, were also found guilty for knowingly shipping salmonella-tainted products across the country \u2014 representing the first time that a company executive has ever been charged with a federal felony in a food safety case \u2014 and may face jail time.\n\nMarler, who also represented the plaintiffs in the cantaloupe case, believes this shift toward punishing executives more harshly \u201cwakes people up\u201d to the issues at stake, and may even help prevent future fraudulence in the food industry.\n\n\u201cKnowing CEOs can go to jail has more impact on behavior than a lawsuit that ends up being paid off by an insurance company,\u201d he said in June, after the DeCosters pleaded guilty. This week, he told the Associated Press that recent prosecutions in this area have definitely made an impression on the food producers he meets.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Why it matters that two people were sentenced to prison for spreading salmonella.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "Why it matters that two people were sentenced to prison for spreading salmonella.", "title": "To Keep Our Food Safe, We May Need To Send People To Jail", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2015/04/14/3646810/egg-salmonella-sentence/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/shutterstock_74032567.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Why it matters that two people were sentenced to prison for spreading salmonella.", "creator": "@Tara_CR", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/shutterstock_74032567-321x214.jpg", "title": "To Keep Our Food Safe, We May Need To Send People To Jail", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/shutterstock_74032567.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/shutterstock_74032567.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-14T13:34:00+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/tculpressler"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb327\"", "article_summary": "In 2011, President Obama approved the first overhaul of food safety laws in 70 years with the Food Safety Modernization Act, which aims to expand the FDA\u2019s power to recall tainted products.\nFood safety officials have historically struggled to keep tabs on a sprawling food industry whose activities span across more than a dozen regulatory offices.\nNow, a judge has sentenced the pair to three months in jail, an outcome that food safety advocates weren\u2019t necessarily counting on.\nBut Congress hasn\u2019t fully funded that initiative, leaving food safety advocates concerned that the agency isn\u2019t well-enough prepared to prevent future outbreaks.\nHealth To Keep Our Food Safe, We May Need To Send People To Jail CREDIT: ShutterstockTwo former egg industry executives are facing potential jail time over their roles in a 2010 salmonella outbreak that sickened thousands of people \u2014 in a case that government officials hope will send a strong signal to companies about how seriously they should be taking food safety."}
