But overmedication of elders has been linked to falls, kidney failure and even heart attacks, and discussions at the American Geriatrics Society\u2019s annual scientific meeting here this week suggest that physicians are getting serious about paring down older adults\u2019 drug regimens.\n\nOne challenge they\u2019re learning how to share with their patients: In a new health care environment where treatments must be based on good medical evidence, there have been few studies of how prescription drugs \u2014 including some potent painkillers \u2014 actually work in older adults.\n\nResearch on their safety and effectiveness has been limited to middle-aged patients who don\u2019t have the overlapping health complications that can cause dangerous, even fatal, drug interactions.\n\n\u201cI would submit that the long-term risks and benefits in older populations remain unknown,\u201d M. Carrington Reid, a geriatrics professor at Weill Cornell Medical College, said at a conference session on opioids for chronic pain. \u201cWe\u2019re in an evidence-based era, and yet we don\u2019t have sufficient data to warrant long-term use.\u201d\n\nCoping with the new demands of health care reform was a prominent topic at the four-day conference, which ended Saturday. So was end-of-life care.\n\nBut the emerging theme of communicating and partnering with older patients in weighing treatment options that are often limited or risky drew standing-room-only crowds.\n\nTough choices\n\nChoosing Wisely, a physicians\u2019 initiative that aims to stem the overuse of unnecessary tests and treatments that can be costly or harmful, was the subject of several workshops here.\n\nOne, titled \u201cWhen Patients Want More Despite the Evidence,\u201d was designed to help doctors have honest conversations with older patients and caregivers about the downsides of specific treatments.\n\nComplicating such communication is what doctors call the \u201cpain paradox.\u201d While some patients abuse powerful narcotics without sufficient symptoms to justify their use, others are suffering needlessly.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 12.5 million Americans take painkillers for unintended reasons, while the Institute of Medicine says some 100 million adults are dealing with chronic pain.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure all of you are struggling with this in your own practice,\u201d said Christine Ritchie, a professor at the University of California at San Francisco. \u201cWe have this incredible tension that many of us feel, between worries about prescription misuse and the inadequate treatment of persistent pain.\u201d\n\n\u201cPseudoaddiction\u201d \u2014 drug-seeking behavior among people whose pain has gone undertreated \u2014 is commonly mistaken for addiction or abuse, Ritchie said. With sparse evidence about what really works in older adults, she said, communication and close monitoring of painkiller use are a doctor\u2019s best options.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very important to make sure they\u2019re experiencing some benefit in terms of improved functions or quality of life, and that they know the risk factors for harm,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd patient agreement has to be done carefully with older adults. You might say, \u2018Just in case you didn\u2019t know, it\u2019s actually a felony to share your pain medication with somebody else.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAbout 10 percent of adults 65 and older take opioids \u2014 narcotics like morphine or oxycodone. And 40 percent receive at least one prescription in a given year for NSAIDs \u2014 nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as ibuprofen, Aleve and Celebrex. (NSAIDs are also available over the counter, and can be dangerous for people with high blood pressure, heart failure or kidney disease.)\n\nEmphasis on assessing pain by using the 1-to-10 scale, he believes, has led to overtreatment. And studies show that opioids are a significant cause of falls and fractures for older adults.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019ve come to, over 20 years of practice,\u201d said Reid, \u201cis that if an NSAID or opioid is not an option, it\u2019s important to communicate the reason why.\n\n\u201cNot discussing it can be problematic. We need to elicit patients\u2019 beliefs and attitudes about medication, and reinforce the tradeoff aspects of all analgesic prescriptions.\u201d\n\nAdverse reactions\n\nFor the typical 75-year-old taking more than 10 prescription drugs, the likelihood of at least one adverse reaction is close to 100 percent, said Michael W. Rich, a cardiology professor at Washington University.\n\nThe average number of adverse reactions is four.\n\nMost people taking cardiac medications, he said, have other serious conditions that also need to be addressed.\n\n\u201cNSAIDs are bad for heart failure patients for multiple reasons; they promote water retention and they directly counteract many drugs,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd yet arthritis symptoms may be the most severe symptoms a person has. We don\u2019t have great alternatives, to this day.\u201d\n\nPatients need to be in control of treatment decisions, Rich added; the most doctors can do is clearly explain possible benefits and risks. He cited a survey of chronic-heart-failure patients, with an average age of 77, half of whom said they would not want to be resuscitated if their hearts stopped.\n\nBut when asked if they would be willing to trade the length of their time remaining for more comfort and a higher quality of life, about 70 percent said no.\n\n\u201cI think this is a very individualized issue,\u201d Rich said. \u201cThe only way we\u2019re going to know this is by asking the patient.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb244\"", "article_summary": "And studies show that opioids are a significant cause of falls and fractures for older adults.\nBut the emerging theme of communicating and partnering with older patients in weighing treatment options that are often limited or risky drew standing-room-only crowds.\n\u201cAnd patient agreement has to be done carefully with older adults.\nWith sparse evidence about what really works in older adults, she said, communication and close monitoring of painkiller use are a doctor\u2019s best options.\nOne, titled \u201cWhen Patients Want More Despite the Evidence,\u201d was designed to help doctors have honest conversations with older patients and caregivers about the downsides of specific treatments."}
