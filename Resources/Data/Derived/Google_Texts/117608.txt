A 69-year-old man from South Carolina died while skiing at Telluride when he apparently crashed into trees.

George A. Nolan of Greenwood, S.C., became the second skiing fatality at Telluride in 10 days, according to a news release from the San Miguel County Sheriff’s Office.

Nolan was skiing with his daughter-in-law on the single black diamond Coonskin run around 3 p.m. Saturday when the accident happened. His daughter-in-law told sheriff’s deputies that Nolan was slightly behind her but then passed her as he was sliding headfirst on his side. One ski was missing, the news release said.

A ski patrol member riding a lift told deputies she saw the man sliding fast with both skis missing when he fell from the top of the Coonskin pitch into some trees, according to the sheriff’s department.

Telluride ski patrollers reached Nolan within minutes, but he was not breathing and did not have a pulse. CPR was unsuccessful.

“We are deeply saddened by this tragic loss, and our thoughts are with the family,” Sheriff Bill Masters said in the news release.

Nolan is survived by his wife, Phyllis Nolan, two sons and a brother. He and his wife are co-owners of a business management firm in Greenwood, a town of 23,000 about 1½ hours from the state capital of Columbia.

On March 9, William Scott Elligott of Colorado Springs died after losing control on steep terrain and tumbling into a steep wooded area at Telluride. He was with his 20- year-old daughter, according to the San Miguel sheriff’s office.
