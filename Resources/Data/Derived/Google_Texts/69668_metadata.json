The company in November lowered its earnings forecast, stopped marketing ACA plans and warned it might stop selling ACA coverage in 2017.\n\nUnited\u2019s e-memo told agents it\u2019s ending sales commissions for ACA plans as well as for individual plans sold off the exchange. The latter are identical to ACA plans but customers can\u2019t receive federal subsidies. The changes do not affect UnitedHealthcare\u2019s Medicare plans or its other lines of health insurance.\n\nThe following is the text of the UnitedHealthcare memo sent to agents:\n\nAdditional Changes Effective Jan. 1, 2016\n\nAlthough UnitedHealthcare\u2019s individual On-Exchange plans remain available in all 34 states marketed for 2016, it has been determined we need to further adjust commissions paid on these products.\n\nEffective January 1, 2016, no commissions will be paid for any new UnitedHealthcare Individual On-Exchange (and Off-Exchange mirror plans*) enrollments received on or after this date, in most states. Please see state exceptions below.** The new commission schedules will be available on our Broker Portal on January 1, 2016.\n\nPlease keep in mind:\n\nThese changes do not affect UnitedHealthcare Medicare agreements or any other lines of UnitedHealthcare business. Only On-Exchange (and Off-Exchange mirror plans) individual health is affected.\n\nUnitedHealthcare will continue to pay according to the commission schedule in effect at the time a plan was sold for all new 2016 On-Exchange plans (and Off-Exchange mirror plans) received December 31, 2015 and prior.\n\nThis change does not affect 2015 renewal commission rates which are unchanged from the 2015 schedules.\n\nThese changes do not affect our members, their networks, plan benefits or the servicing of their plans.\n\nAs insurance companies across the nation make adjustments in response to the evolving Marketplace, it is our sincere hope that you will continue to remain active in the health insurance market. Your knowledge and professional services are valued by consumers and carriers alike.\n\nThank you for your business and also your patience as we implement these changes.\n\n*Mirror plans are those plans that are identical to On-Exchange Plans (same license, benefits, etc.) and are required to be offered Off Exchange.\n\n**On-Exchange Individual health plan enrollments through UnitedHealthcare Benefits Plan of California, and UnitedHealthcare of New York, Inc. have no commission changes. Health Plan of Nevada, Inc. will move to no commission\u2019s payable for Exchange business starting with business received on February 1, 2016 and after.", "article_metadata": {"description": "UnitedHealthcare, the nation\u2019s largest health insurer, which announced that it will likely leave the Affordable Care Act marketplace due to losses under the", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.1", "og": {"site_name": "IFAwebnews.com", "description": "UnitedHealthcare, the nation\u2019s largest health insurer, which announced that it will likely leave the Affordable Care Act marketplace due to losses under the law, announced that it will stop paying \u2026", "title": "UnitedHealthcare to end agent commissions for health plans in Obamacare markets", "url": "http://ifawebnews.com/2015/12/08/unitedhealthcare-to-end-agent-commissions-for-health-plans-in-obamacare-markets/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary"}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-08T15:40:02+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-08T15:40:02+00:00"}, "verify-v1": "Fve8IDDdj94aX4Ar18+v33qGgAesGnY2YiqbnR5P17I="}, "article_summary": "**On-Exchange Individual health plan enrollments through UnitedHealthcare Benefits Plan of California, and UnitedHealthcare of New York, Inc. have no commission changes.\nUnited\u2019s e-memo told agents it\u2019s ending sales commissions for ACA plans as well as for individual plans sold off the exchange.\n*Mirror plans are those plans that are identical to On-Exchange Plans (same license, benefits, etc.)\nThe company in November lowered its earnings forecast, stopped marketing ACA plans and warned it might stop selling ACA coverage in 2017.\nOnly On-Exchange (and Off-Exchange mirror plans) individual health is affected."}
