REUTERS/Mike Theiler\n\n3984999\n\nAmerica\u2019s families will soon get their turkey, potatoes and cranberries at Thanksgiving and Christmas dinners \u2014 but some will also get a tableside political pitch for the Obamacare insurance network.\n\nPresident Barack Obama\u2019s deputies at Organizing for Action are urging supporters to give an Obamacare pitch to their relatives during the most iconic of American family and religious events.\n\n\u201cTake advantage of downtime after meals or between holiday activities to start your talk,\u201d says OFA\u2019s marketing script, titled \u201cHealth Care for the Holidays.\u201d\n\nAt Thanksgiving and Christmas dinners, \u201cpeople will be under the \u201cmisconception that the government-designed health-payment plans are too expensive,\u201d says the presidential pitch, which was emailed out on Nov. 23.\n\n\u201cTell them: There are a variety of plans available in the new health insurance marketplace, so you can pick one that fits your budget. There\u2019s also financial assistance available based on how much you make,\u201d says OFA\u2019s script.\n\nObama\u2019s effort to push his political priorities into Americans\u2019 private family and religious events reflects his determination to take over the nation\u2019s health-care sector.\n\nObama and his progressives allies believe that average Americans need their professional, university-learned and well-paid skills to manage their lives. That\u2019s very different from Americans\u2019 evolved popular culture, which declares that families are best able to help young people develop good character.\n\nThe progressives\u2019 determination to gatecrash iconic family events reflects self-confidence in their own expertise, their long-held pity and contempt for ordinary Americans and for the institution of family, plus their ability to attract young people to their cause.\n\nBut it also shows how Obama and his deputies are worried that their trouble-plagued Obamacare network is in peril.\n\nThe online script tries to build up the confidence of young people nervous about making the dinner-table pitch. \u201cIf you have family members who are uninsured, you can play a big part in helping them find coverage that works for them. It might not always seem like it, but your family listens to you. So have the talk,\u201d isays the pitch.\n\nThe pitch was previewed Nov. 18 by Sara El-Amine, OFA\u2019s national training director at Organizing for Action. \u201cWe all have that uncle or that cousin who needs to be convinced or who needs health-insurance\u2026 so [OFA volunteers have begun to] practice those sometime-hard conversations,\u201d she said in a phone call to OFA\u2019s volunteers.\n\n\u201cIf every person on this call committed to something small, like talking to your uninsured cousin or nephew at the Thanksgiving table, think about the impact we could have,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to be able to fight this fight without you,\u201d she told the volunteers, who had gathered to hear a statement from their leader, Obama.\n\nThe online script glosses over the many problems with the Obamacare website. But it urges supporters to ask relatives to bring personal information, such as Social Security Numbers, to the dinner so they can use the family computer to join Obamacare after dessert.\n\nThe OFA script includes a short video, in which two drab parents urge their friendless young son to buy health-insurance, while they eat Obamacare-compliant small portions of drab food.\n\nThe script downplays the cost of Obamacare premiums and deductibles, which are especially high for young, healthy people.\n\nThe Obamacare system depends on the monthly Obamcare tax payments from young and healthy people, many of whom are already struggling to save money, get married, pay off student loans or even get a full-time job in stalled economy.\n\nYoung peoples\u2019 Obamacare taxes are used to offset the huge cost of providing very expensive insurance to Democrat-leaning groups of immigrants, unskilled, unmarried or sick people.\n\nOther regimes have used children to help government penetrate private family and religious events.\n\nOne extreme example is provided by the violent rulers of the Soviet Union, who urged the nation\u2019s children to follow the fabricated example of 14 year-old Pavel Morozov. The boy, according to the official Soviet investigation of his death in 1932, was killed by relatives after he called the secret police to arrest his father for illegal activities. The father was shot after a trial, according to the fabricated story.\n\nFour of his Morozov\u2019s relatives were reputedly shot by the Soviet government to help boost the story, which was used to persuade millions of kids to be loyal to government rather than to their families.\n\nObama\u2019s determination to pitch his Obamacare program is now tinged with desperation, following the public\u2019s recognition that Obama\u2019s university-trained aides spectacularly failed to manage a staged rollout of the Obamacare network, despite three years of planning.\n\nIn recent weeks, Obama\u2019s ratings have plunged down to roughly 40 percent, following the public\u2019s recognition that he lied when he said in 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2103 that Americans would be able to keep their insurance plans and doctors after the Obamcare networks is established.\n\nMany Americans\u2019 access to their healthcare is being reduced by Obamacare\u2019s crippled malfunctioning website, by large price spikes, by shrinking access to doctors and reduced marketplace choices.\n\nGOP legislators are trying to develop a replacement system, that would provide large tax-breaks to help people to buy health-insurance from any qualified company in the nation. The GOP alternative would provide federal money to help sick people offset the cost of debilitating medical conditions, and allow them to keep their insurance when they lose or change jobs.\n\nFollow Neil on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Neil Munro", "description": "The White House's 'Health Care for the Holidays' campaign will add an Obamacare pitch to your turkey dinner", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "America\u2019s families will soon get their turkey, potatoes and cranberries at Thanksgiving and Christmas dinners -- but some will also get a tableside political pitch for the Obamacare insurance networ", "title": "Obama wants a seat at your Thanksgiving dinner", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2013/11/25/obama-wants-a-seat-at-your-thanksgiving-dinner/", "image": {"width": 630, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/2013-11-25T050844Z_1_CBRE9AO0EAO00_RTROPTP_4_USA-OBAMA-e1385360685490.jpg", "height": 270}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The White House's 'Health Care for the Holidays' campaign will add an Obamacare pitch to your turkey dinner", "title": "Obama wants a seat at your Thanksgiving dinner Via @dailycaller", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2013/11/25/obama-wants-a-seat-at-your-thanksgiving-dinner/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/2013-11-25T050844Z_1_CBRE9AO0EAO00_RTROPTP_4_USA-OBAMA-e1385360685490.jpg"}, "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2013-11-25 01:25:45", "sailthru.title": "Obama wants a seat at your Thanksgiving dinner", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "sailthru.tags": "obamacare,neil-munro", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "keywords": "obamacare", "sailthru.description": "America\u2019s families will soon get their turkey, potatoes and cranberries at Thanksgiving and Christmas dinners -- but some will also get a tableside political pitch for the Obamacare insurance networ", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/2013-11-25T050844Z_1_CBRE9AO0EAO00_RTROPTP_4_USA-OBAMA-e1385360685490.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb588\"", "article_summary": "REUTERS/Mike Theiler3984999America\u2019s families will soon get their turkey, potatoes and cranberries at Thanksgiving and Christmas dinners \u2014 but some will also get a tableside political pitch for the Obamacare insurance network.\nThere\u2019s also financial assistance available based on how much you make,\u201d says OFA\u2019s script.\nThat\u2019s very different from Americans\u2019 evolved popular culture, which declares that families are best able to help young people develop good character.\nPresident Barack Obama\u2019s deputies at Organizing for Action are urging supporters to give an Obamacare pitch to their relatives during the most iconic of American family and religious events.\nBut it also shows how Obama and his deputies are worried that their trouble-plagued Obamacare network is in peril."}
