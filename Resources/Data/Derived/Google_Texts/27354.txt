Shaun White’s adding a new twist for Sochi.

Well, half a twist, really.

On a video posted to a sponsor’s YouTube site Thursday, White shows the world the trick he’s been working on for the upcoming Olympics.

It’s a frontside double-cork 1440, which resembles his Double McTwist 1260 but adds another half revolution of twist inside the two head-over-heels flips.

“Just that subtle a change, it throws the whole axis of the trick off,” White told The Associated Press recently. “It’s a completely different thing.”

White’s McTwist 1260 had been the most difficult trick on the halfpipe. He perfected it in the lead-up to the Vancouver Olympics and landed it on his second run there.

He said he’s pleased with the 1440 and has no problem showing the competition what he has up his sleeve.

“Just because you can see the trick doesn’t mean it’s easy to duplicate,” he said.

White hurt his left ankle during a halfpipe run at the Dew Tour in Breckenridge. He ended up finishing second, then pulled out of the halfpipe the next week at Copper Mountain so he could focus on slopestyle.

The next selection event starts Jan. 8 in Breckenridge, giving White a few weeks to heal. Through the first two halfpipe qualifiers, few competitors have tried anything more than a double-cork 1080, meaning there may not be any pressure on White to unveil either of his two biggest tricks.

Of course, the two-time defending Olympic champion doesn’t always see things that way.

“It’s time to just do those tricks,” he said a few days before he hurt his ankle. “If you’re going to do them, do them now. It’s a new one I’m hoping to slide into the run.”
