Jay Inslee presented the Medal of Valor to the Sauk-Suiattle Tribe and to the communities of Arlington, Darrington and Oso on March 18. The Medal of Valor has historically been awarded to \u201cany person who has saved, or attempted to save, the life of another at the risk of serious injury or death to himself or herself.\u201d Legislation passed this year and signed by Inslee updated the statute so that the medal can be awarded to communities as well.\n\nSauk-Suiattle is located 21.5 miles east of the landslide area. The landslide cut off access to Interstate 5 and major economic, employment, and medical amenities in the region. Residents east of the landslide area had to drive more than 90 miles using an alternate route to get to Interstate 5.\n\nRELATED: President Declares Major Disaster in Oso, Washington as Landslide Deaths Reach 29\n\nNative Landslide Survivor Describes Devastating Wall of Mud; Missing Reduced to 30\n\nAfter the landslide, Sauk-Suiattle expanded hours at its gas station, the only station in the town of Darrington, provided gas at cost to emergency responders, and honored gas cards provided to residents by FEMA.
