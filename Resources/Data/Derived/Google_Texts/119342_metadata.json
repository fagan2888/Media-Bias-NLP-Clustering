What\u2019s less often noted is that he thinks the Mexican government is run by the world\u2019s most hyper-competent supervillains. The upshot is that only Trump has the wherewithal to beat them.\n\n\u201cWhen Mexico sends its people, they\u2019re not sending their best,\u201d he said as he announced his candidacy last June. \u201cThey\u2019re not sending you. They\u2019re not sending you. They\u2019re sending people that have lots of problems, and they\u2019re bringing those problems with us. They\u2019re bringing drugs. They\u2019re bringing crime. They\u2019re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Mexican government,\u201d he later added, \u201cforces many bad people into our country because they\u2019re smart\u2026. They\u2019re smarter than our leaders, and their negotiators are far better than what we have, to a degree that you wouldn\u2019t believe.\u201d\n\nTrump honestly seems to believe that Mexican migration to the United States is controlled by the Mexican government, rather than, say, complex economic changes and cross-border social ties. Now, it turns out, he thinks that the Mexican government controls the Pope as well, and tricked the head of the Catholic Church into disliking Trump.\n\n\u201cThe Pope was in Mexico,\u201d Trump said, responding to Francis\u2019s comment yesterday that his border-wall lust disqualified him from Christianity. \u201cDo you know that? Does everyone know that? He said negative things about me because the Mexican government convinced him that Trump is not a good guy because I want to have a strong border, I want to stop illegal immigration, I want to stop people from being killed.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "It's becoming increasingly clear that Trump isn't just inexperienced \u2014 he's actually living in a fantasy world", "title": "Donald Trump\u2019s remedial guide to foreign policy: The GOP frontrunner has no idea how statecraft actually works", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "It's becoming increasingly clear that Trump isn't just inexperienced \u2014 he's actually living in a fantasy world", "title": "Donald Trump\u2019s remedial guide to foreign policy: The GOP frontrunner has no idea how statecraft actually works", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/02/20/donald_trumps_remedial_guide_to_foreign_policy_the_gop_frontrunner_has_no_idea_how_statecraft_actually_works/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/02/donald_trump84.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "It's becoming increasingly clear that Trump isn't just inexperienced \u2014 he's actually living in a fantasy world", "title": "Donald Trump\u2019s remedial guide to foreign policy: The GOP frontrunner has no idea how statecraft actually works", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/02/donald_trump84.jpg", "creator": "@danieldenvir", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Daniel Denvir", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Donald Trump, Editor's Picks, Elections 2016, GOP primary", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "They\u2019re sending people that have lots of problems, and they\u2019re bringing those problems with us.\nThey\u2019re bringing drugs.\nThey\u2019re bringing crime.\nWhat\u2019s less often noted is that he thinks the Mexican government is run by the world\u2019s most hyper-competent supervillains.\n\u201cWhen Mexico sends its people, they\u2019re not sending their best,\u201d he said as he announced his candidacy last June."}
