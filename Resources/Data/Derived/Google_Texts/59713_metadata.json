The NRA would include a leg down the San Gabriel River to Pico Rivera and extend east to include the ecologically sensitive Whittier Hills.\n\nAlmost two-thirds of the acreage that comprise the recreation area would consist of land already designated as part of the federal Angeles National Forest managed by the U.S. Forest Service, a division of the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\n\nUnder the bill authored by Rep. Judy Chu, D-Pasadena, the U.S. National Park Service would be brought in to partner with the Forest Service, as well as local and state governments, to add better signage, trails, recreation and interpretive programs.\n\nEstimates vary from 3 million to 5 million as to the number of visitors a year to the Angeles, the largest urban forest in the United States. Critics, including Chu, say the Forest Service does a poor job keeping the vast wild areas clean and managing the swarm of visitors. Some 12,000 commenters signed off on the recreation area idea during public hearings in 2011 and 2012 as a way to increase wilderness access for the county\u2019s minority population and to improve aesthetics.\n\n\u201cRight now, we have trash, graffiti and poor or non-existent signage (in the Angeles),\u201d Chu said in an exclusive interview Wednesday. \u201cWe have traffic problems and lack of parking management. We have safety concerns. With this NRA you can have an overall view of the future of the San Gabriel Mountains by drawing on other resources to make that happen.\u201d\n\nMark Masaoka, the policy director of the Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council, an umbrella group of 40 Asian-American organizations including the Asian Youth Center and the Chinatown Service Center, said many Asian Americans need a safer forest experience.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe noted the tragic death of 17-year-old Mark Keppel High School student Esther Suen, who fell 200 feet to her death while hiking Eaton Canyon in northeast Pasadena during spring break in March 2013.\n\n\u201cWe are involved because we see the potential for increased resources,\u201d Masaoka said Wednesday. \u201cWe want to make trails safer and more accessible, like you\u2019d see at national parks.\u201d\n\nA new National Recreation Area \u2014 including the San Gabriel Mountains, two riverfronts and Puente-Chino Hills \u2014 will show up as a line item in the National Parks Service budget, Chu said. That is not the case with the U.S. Forest Service, she said, because funding is grouped in regions, not specific forests.\n\n\u201cRemember, the main function of the Forest Service is to fight fires. Recreation is last on its priority list. That is why nothing gets done,\u201d Chu said.\n\nThe seed money for a new NRA in the San Gabriels would equal between $2 million and $4 million, a small amount. Even the NPS has said they can\u2019t afford to manage a new NRA of this size and had recommended a much smaller NRA that excluded the forest.\n\n\u201cI tell people that the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area started with one employee and now they have 100,\u201d said Belinda Faustinos, co-chair of San Gabriel Mountains Forever, a group working six years on this bill. Faustinos remembers when the wilderness area west of the 405 Freeway became L.A.\u2019s first NRA \u2014 during the term of President Richard Nixon.\n\nChu has gathered the support of the San Gabriel Valley Council of Governments as well as the cities of Alhambra, Claremont, El Monte, Glendora, Monterey Park, San Gabriel, South El Monte and Rancho Cucamonga.\n\nSome cities are concerned that the NRA\u2019s boundary is too vague. In fact, an exact map is not provided with the bill. \u201cIt is like what Nancy Pelosi said about Obamacare: \u2018You have to pass the bill so that you can find out what is in it,\u2019\u201d said Margaret Clark, a Rosemead city council member who also serves on the San Gabriel & Lower Los Angeles Rivers and Mountains Conservancy.\n\nMost agree that the bill will be tough sledding in Congress. Faustinos said if the bill were to get a hearing this year she would be surprised. The bill\u2019s first stop would be either the Natural Resources Committee or the Agriculture Committee, Chu said.\n\nEven without a hearing or passage, the bill could help local groups compete for federal environmental grants, Faustinos said. That\u2019s because the Park Service said the region meets the criteria of ecological and historic significance for designation as an NRA.\n\nSpecifically, the bill would require the National Park Service, the Department of Agriculture and the Forest Service to develop an \u201cintegrated visitor services plan\u201d within three years of passage that would \u201cimprove visitor experiences within the recreation area through expanded recreation opportunities,\u201d according to Section 9 of the bill.\n\nThis would include an assessment of the demand for hiking, picnicking, horseback riding and the use of motorized and mechanized vehicles.\n\nFaustinos said the bill does not prohibit existing uses, such as off-highway vehicle riding in the designated OHV area in San Gabriel Canyon. Chu said the bill does not transfer private lands to any federal entity.\n\nThe Main San Gabriel Basin Watermaster and the San Gabriel Valley Water Association support the bill. Their support came after months of negotiations between Chu and the water agencies that resulted in language that says the NRA nor the Park Service would not interfere with water rights or with management of reservoirs or dams.\n\nHowever, Monrovia is worried that the city would lose local control over canyon areas purchased by residents through a recent parcel tax. Clark said the author promised cities the option to opt out of the NRA, something not in the bill. Azusa is also concerned about additional traffic up Highway 39 if the Park Service were to beef up access to San Gabriel Canyon.\n\nThe effort began in 2003 when then Rep. Hilda Solis, who grew up in Bassett, introduced legislation with Sen. Barbara Boxer to study the concept. It received a huge boost in 2010 under President Barack Obama\u2019s America\u2019s Great Outdoors initiative.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Legislation more than 10 years in the making that places 615,245 acres of Angeles National Forest land, foothills, the San Gabriel and Rio Hondo rivers and the Puente-Chino Hills into a new National Recreation Area was sent to Congress on Thursday.", "title": "National Recreation Area bill for Angeles National Forest submitted to Congress", "og": {"url": "http://www.sgvtribune.com/government-and-politics/20140612/national-recreation-area-bill-for-angeles-national-forest-submitted-to-congress", "image": {"width": "512px", "identifier": "http://local.sgvtribune.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/small/sgvtribune_new.png", "height": "512px"}, "type": "article", "title": "National Recreation Area bill for Angeles National Forest submitted to Congress"}, "twitter": {"domain": "sgvtribune.com", "description": "Legislation more than 10 years in the making that places 615,245 acres of Angeles National Forest land, foothills, the San Gabriel and Rio Hondo rivers and the Puente-Chino Hills into a new National Recreation Area was sent to Congress on Thursday.", "title": "National Recreation Area bill for Angeles National Forest submitted to Congress", "url": "http://www.sgvtribune.com/government-and-politics/20140612/national-recreation-area-bill-for-angeles-national-forest-submitted-to-congress", "image": {"src": "http://local.sgvtribune.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/small/sgvtribune.png?052016"}, "site": "@SGVTribune", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id551759403", "iphone": "id503025528", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.sangabrielvalleytribune"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "keywords": "Bills, Bills news, West Covina Bills news, CA Bills news, US Bills news, world Bills news.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Bills, Bills news, West Covina Bills news, CA Bills news, US Bills news, world Bills news."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcdb8\"", "article_summary": "The Main San Gabriel Basin Watermaster and the San Gabriel Valley Water Association support the bill.\nAlmost two-thirds of the acreage that comprise the recreation area would consist of land already designated as part of the federal Angeles National Forest managed by the U.S. Forest Service, a division of the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\nThat is not the case with the U.S. Forest Service, she said, because funding is grouped in regions, not specific forests.\nCritics, including Chu, say the Forest Service does a poor job keeping the vast wild areas clean and managing the swarm of visitors.\n\u201cRemember, the main function of the Forest Service is to fight fires."}
