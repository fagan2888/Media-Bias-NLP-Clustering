Bishops have talked only about sin, with little to say about confession, repentance, grace, mercy, forgiveness, healing and salvation (in other words, the entire world of the Sacraments).\n\nLet's pause for a second and look at what the Catechism of the Catholic Church says in its specific language about homosexuality (and read it all, not just the \"intrinsically disordered\" part).\n\nThis material is long, but crucial. Yes, I know that you have not been reading this in newspapers over the past few days.\n\n2357 Homosexuality refers to relations between men or between women who experience an exclusive or predominant sexual attraction toward persons of the same sex. It has taken a great variety of forms through the centuries and in different cultures. Its psychological genesis remains largely unexplained. Basing itself on Sacred Scripture, which presents homosexual acts as acts of grave depravity, 141 tradition has always declared that \"homosexual acts are intrinsically disordered.\" 142 They are contrary to the natural law. They close the sexual act to the gift of life. They do not proceed from a genuine affective and sexual complementarity. Under no circumstances can they be approved.\n\n2358 The number of men and women who have deep-seated homosexual tendencies is not negligible. This inclination, which is objectively disordered, constitutes for most of them a trial. They must be accepted with respect, compassion, and sensitivity. Every sign of unjust discrimination in their regard should be avoided. These persons are called to fulfill God's will in their lives and, if they are Christians, to unite to the sacrifice of the Lord's Cross the difficulties they may encounter from their condition.\n\n2359 Homosexual persons are called to chastity. By the virtues of self-mastery that teach them inner freedom, at times by the support of disinterested friendship, by prayer and sacramental grace, they can and should gradually and resolutely approach Christian perfection.\n\nNote several things, starting with the fact that the press coverage in the past 24 hours has focused on a changed \"tone,\" as opposed to doctrinal content, in Vatican discussions of gay relationships. That's accurate and important.\n\nHowever, we are not hearing about another crucial doctrinal element that, surely, is being discussed. You see, for critics the most infamous language in the Catechism focuses on \"homosexual acts\" as opposed to orientation. The \"acts\" are contrary to natural law.\n\nYes, the Catechism also says that the \"inclination\" -- think orientation -- is \"objectively disordered,\" but it refers to these temptations as a \"trial,\" not a sin. It's crucial to realize that in Catholic doctrine trials and temptations are a form of suffering and, when endured, should be seen as kind of martyrdom and a doorway to holiness.\n\nOne might even go so far as to say that faithful believers who do not yield to these temptations, or who struggle, repent and are forgiven, have the potential to receive spiritual gifts that they can offer their church and that the church must recognize and welcome.\n\nHold that thought. This would be true for all believers, in ancient Christian thought, who are called to singleness and celibacy -- gay and straight. It would be true with temptations in general, with all trials and struggles in this life.\n\nAt this point, the church then begins to engage the modern realities of relationships outside of the Sacrament of Marriage.\n\n* Clearly, there are Catholics who believe that -- at the pastoral level -- priests need to have more flexibility in working with people whose sexual relationships are both (a) a potential source of strength in their lives and (b) clearly sinful in the eyes of centuries of Christian doctrine.\n\nThis is where things get tricky.\n\nIf you read the language of the debates, you will see that there are leaders who want to show mercy and kindness up front -- with little or no up-front talk about sin and repentance -- because they believe that this is truly the best, the most pastoral, way to bring wayward believers into the process of confession and reconciliation. This is, many believe, the Pope Francis way.\n\n* Ah, but what if there are Catholics who SAY THIS is their approach but in reality they are not interested in that old confession of sin stuff at all? What if, at the level of local ministry, they essentially are saying that you open the door wide and then hope for the best, that in a post-Vatican II world you have to leave this up to the individual conscience? I mean, who goes to confession these days anyway? What are they supposed to confess? Talking about sin is so negative and modern life is so complex. You know?\n\n* Finally, you do have Catholics who are engaged in a long, slow, strategic march through the structures of the institutional church to change the actual practice and doctrines of the Catholic faith. They want to move the pieces on the great doctrinal game board and a few of them are even open about that.\n\nSo, who are you hearing quoted the most in the news reports?\n\nGo back to my \"hold that thought\" reference.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Let's pause for a second and think of the many different Catholic camps -- \r\nwe will leave the secular world out of this for a moment -- that exist when \r\ndiscussing a subject as complex as the moral status of sexual activity \r\noutside of marriage.
