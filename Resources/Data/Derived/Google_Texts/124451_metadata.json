Education is no different. From teachers\u2019 unions to New York Times pundits, the answer is always \u201cmore money.\u201d Conservatives doubt that solution \u2013 that just dumping money into the education system doesn\u2019t actually improve student outcomes. This isn\u2019t a new argument, but a new study out from the Cato Institute [pdf] finds that not a single state was able to improve their education outcomes by increasing the amount of taxpayer money they spent on education.\n\nAuthor Andrew J. Coulson writes:\n\nNot only have dramatic spending increases been unaccompanied by improvements in performance, the same is true of the occasional spending declines experienced by some states. At one time or another over the past four decades, Alaska, California, Florida, and New York all experienced multi-year periods over which real spending fell substantially (20 percent or more of their 1972 expenditure levels). And yet, none of these states experienced noticeable declines in adjusted SAT scores\u2014either contemporaneously or lagged by a few years. Indeed, their score trends seem entirely disconnected from their rising and falling levels of spending.\n\nOverall, this can be summed up in one damning chart:\n\nDon\u2019t expect this to halt the advocacy from progressives for more money for education. Proper reforms focus on how current spending levels are distributed \u2013 not just pouring more into the hole.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Public money pit.", "title": "New study, new confirmation that dumping money into schools doesn\u2019t fix them", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2014/03/20/new-study-new-confirmation-that-dumping-money-into-schools-doesnt-fix-them/", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/blog/americantrends.png", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-03-20T23:21:08+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-03-20T19:36:51+00:00"}, "keywords": "education,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2a88\"", "article_summary": "New study, new confirmation that dumping money into schools doesn\u2019t fix themposted at 7:21 pm on March 20, 2014 by Kevin GlassSo many progressive \u201csolutions\u201d to public policy problems simply involve dumping money into a hole.\nAnd yet, none of these states experienced noticeable declines in adjusted SAT scores\u2014either contemporaneously or lagged by a few years.\nProper reforms focus on how current spending levels are distributed \u2013 not just pouring more into the hole.\nFrom teachers\u2019 unions to New York Times pundits, the answer is always \u201cmore money.\u201d Conservatives doubt that solution \u2013 that just dumping money into the education system doesn\u2019t actually improve student outcomes.\nOverall, this can be summed up in one damning chart:Don\u2019t expect this to halt the advocacy from progressives for more money for education."}
