JGR drivers have actually won the Unlimited in four of the last five years, and Hamlin has three victories since 2006.\n\nHamlin overcame early damage to his Toyota to score his first victory with new crew chief Mike Wheeler, who was a longtime engineer for the No. 11 team before his promotion. Wheeler gambled on fuel strategy, a luxury he had because the results of the race have no meaning, and spent most of the closing laps encouraging Hamlin to save fuel.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if he was poised. He was poised on the radio,\u201d Hamlin said about the crew chief. \u201cWe\u2019ve got such a young team, crew chief, engineers, they all look like they\u2019re a bunch of high school kids.\u201d\n\nWinning this exhibition race doesn\u2019t always translate into Daytona 500 success. The last driver to win the opening race and the 500 was Dale Jarrett in 2000.\n\nJoey Logano, last year\u2019s Daytona 500 winner, finished second in a Ford and was followed by Paul Menard, Kyle Larson and Casey Mears, all in Chevrolets.\n\nJGR was the most dominant team for most of last year and put all four of its drivers in the Chase for the Sprint Cup championship. The title then went to JGR driver Kyle Busch, who won the season-finale at Homestead to earn his first Sprint Cup championship.\n\nAll four JGR cars worked well together Saturday night, which Hamlin noted is a good sign of things to come this season.\n\n\u201cThis win couldn\u2019t be possible without my teammates,\u201d Hamlin said. \u201cMatt (Kenseth) sacrificed so much, pushing me at the right time. Total team effort. Just like Kyle\u2019s championship, we win as one. This is a Joe Gibbs Racing win.\u201d\n\nBrian Vickers\u2019 return to a race car lasted just 23 laps before a tire problem caused him to lose control of the car he was driving for injured driver Tony Stewart. The incident triggered a six-car accident that included Stewart-Haas Racing teammate Kevin Harvick.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate I\u2019m in this car because that means Tony is sitting at home,\u201d Vickers said. \u201cBut I\u2019m just doing the best I can. It\u2019s an honor to fill this seat. I was just out there having fun until we got into the wall. It wasn\u2019t anyone\u2019s fault we just cut a tire. We will just go get them for the Daytona 500.\u201d\n\nThe race gave NASCAR its first chance to try its new overtime rule, which states the leader must cross a marker to make a race official. Hamlin hit that spot as he tried to hold off Logano and Menard, and a wreck behind the leaders eventually brought out the caution that froze the field and sealed Hamlin\u2019s victory.\n\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t really come into play because we took the white flag under green, which was the same under the old format,\u201d Logano said of the new overtime rule.\n\nThe race is a chance for teams to shake off any cobwebs from the offseason and ready for the Feb. 21 season-opening Daytona 500. Drivers are usually anxious and wrecks are common: Only 12 of the 25 cars finished on the lead lap and 10 cars failed to finish the race.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a non-points race that plays into it or if it\u2019s just superspeedway racing,\u201d Logano said. \u201cTypically in the Unlimited, there a lot of crashes.\u201d\n\nLarson considered himself lucky to be among the finishers.\n\n\u201cI learned that I had a lot of luck. I missed probably three or four really close wrecks there,\u201d Larson said. \u201cHopefully I didn\u2019t use up all my luck before next Sunday.\u201d\n\nDale Earnhardt Jr., always a favorite at Daytona and winner of last July\u2019s race here, was involved in an early accident and finished four laps behind Hamlin.\n\n\u201cTypical. Everybody is excited to get in the cars and be competing in a race, so they are really aggressive,\u201d he said. \u201cThis race is always really aggressive. There is nothing on the line. There are a lot of accidents, torn up cars in this race pretty much every year. It\u2019s a good one to win. When you win it, you did a good job and Denny did a good job.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Denny Hamlin wins opening Daytona race for third time", "title": "Denny Hamlin wins opening Daytona race for third time", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/02/13/denny-hamlin-wins-opening-daytona-race-for-third-time/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160213__BN20160214_C11_BNSP14NASCARp1.jpg", "height": 450}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160213__BN20160214_C11_BNSP14NASCARp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2016-02-13T23:03:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-18T02:51:08+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a non-points race that plays into it or if it\u2019s just superspeedway racing,\u201d Logano said.\nAll four JGR cars worked well together Saturday night, which Hamlin noted is a good sign of things to come this season.\nDenny Hamlin won the Sprint Unlimited \u2014 the kickoff to Speedweeks \u2014 on Saturday night to give JGR its third consecutive win in the exhibition race.\nThe last driver to win the opening race and the 500 was Dale Jarrett in 2000.\nJGR drivers have actually won the Unlimited in four of the last five years, and Hamlin has three victories since 2006."}
