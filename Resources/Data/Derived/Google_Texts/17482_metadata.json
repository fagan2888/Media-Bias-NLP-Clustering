Afghans are just happy the transfer of power happened without bloodshed \u2014 a rarity here.\n\nBut Ghani has his work cut out. As he whittles away at corruption, economic problems, and the insurgency, he also has to deal with the ever-increasing problem of drugs.\n\nThe Office of the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) released a new report on Tuesday that lays out the facts in stark detail:\n\n\u2022 The US has spent $7.6 billion on counternarcotics efforts in Afghanistan over the past 12 years. Yet poppy cultivation has reached unprecedented levels, with more than 516,000 acres of the opium crop now planted.\n\n\u2022 Previously \u201cpoppy-free\u201d provinces are now growing it.\n\n\u2022 Deep-well technology has allowed farmers to reclaim almost 500,000 acres of desert land for cultivation \u2014 most of which has gone for poppy.\n\n\u2022 The value of the crop and its derivative products is estimated to be about $3 billion \u2014 up from $2 billion the year before. Proceeds from drugs fuel corruption and the insurgency.\n\nSIGAR \u2014 an independent US government watchdog \u2014 prodded President Barack Obama\u2019s administration to take stock.\n\n\u201cThe recent record-high level of poppy cultivation calls into question the long-term effectiveness and sustainability of [prior US government and coalition] efforts,\u201d John Sopko, the agency\u2019s special inspector general, said in a letter to top members of Obama\u2019s Cabinet. \u201cGiven the severity of the opium problem and its potential to undermine US objectives in Afghanistan, I strongly suggest that your departments consider the trends in opium cultivation and the effectiveness of past counternarcotics efforts when planning future initiatives.\u201d\n\nIn other words, it ain\u2019t working.\n\nNot our fault\n\nThe Department of Defense (DOD) took umbrage at SIGAR\u2019s evaluation. The real culprit according to Michael Lumpkin, deputy defense secretary, is the Afghan government.\n\n\u201cThe failure to reduce poppy cultivation and increase eradication is due to the lack of Afghan government support for the effort,\u201d Lumpkin writes in a letter to Sopko that was included in the SIGAR report.\n\nHe also bristled at the suggestion that Defense may not be taking heed of past failures:\n\n\u201cThe DOD always attempts to apply lessons learned,\u201d he wrote, right before asking that Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel be removed from the distribution list \u201csince the report provides no new information relating to our department.\u201d\n\nThe State Department also voiced its objections, although more diplomatically, as is its wont.\n\nMore from GlobalPost: Afghanistan: The rise of a narco state\n\nCharles Randolph, a program coordinator at the US Embassy in Kabul, allowed that the soaring poppy crop was \u201cdisappointing, as was the decline in poppy eradication by provincial authorities this year.\u201d\n\nBut he delicately points out that \u201cour counternarcotics goals can be accomplished only when they are also Afghan counternarcotics goals.\u201d Ahem.\n\n\u201cWe look forward to the new Afghan government assuming a leadership role in this regard.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The U.S. has spent $7.6 billion on counternarcotics, and the country's opium industry is now bigger than ever", "title": "America\u2019s disastrous drug war in Afghanistan", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The U.S. has spent $7.6 billion on counternarcotics, and the country's opium industry is now bigger than ever", "title": "America\u2019s disastrous drug war in Afghanistan", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/10/26/americas_disastrous_drug_war_in_afghanistan_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2012/10/afghanistan-opium-trade-heroin-production-war-on-drugs82221.jpeg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The U.S. has spent $7.6 billion on counternarcotics, and the country's opium industry is now bigger than ever", "title": "America\u2019s disastrous drug war in Afghanistan", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2012/10/afghanistan-opium-trade-heroin-production-war-on-drugs82221.jpeg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Jean MacKenzie", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Afghanistan, Ashraf Ghani Ahmadzai, GlobalPost, Opium, SIGAR", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8da1\"", "article_summary": "Yet poppy cultivation has reached unprecedented levels, with more than 516,000 acres of the opium crop now planted.\nTopics: Afghanistan, Ashraf Ghani Ahmadzai, GlobalPost, Opium, SIGAR, Business News, Politics NewsThis article originally appeared on GlobalPostKABUL, Afghanistan \u2014 Ashraf Ghani Ahmadzai, Afghanistan\u2019s new president, has basked in a warm wave of national goodwill since taking office last month.\n\u2022 Deep-well technology has allowed farmers to reclaim almost 500,000 acres of desert land for cultivation \u2014 most of which has gone for poppy.\nAs he whittles away at corruption, economic problems, and the insurgency, he also has to deal with the ever-increasing problem of drugs.\n\u201cThe recent record-high level of poppy cultivation calls into question the long-term effectiveness and sustainability of [prior US government and coalition] efforts,\u201d John Sopko, the agency\u2019s special inspector general, said in a letter to top members of Obama\u2019s Cabinet."}
