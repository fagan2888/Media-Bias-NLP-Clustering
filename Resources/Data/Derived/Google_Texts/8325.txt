Well all the hoopla around the new Obamacare seems to have finally died off, and at long last we got to see what the new healthcare plan is all about.

While the plan appeared to be one of Obama’s crowning achievements, the new online health insurance exchanges are off to a rocky start. The website has been riddled with glitches and technical difficulties.

President Obama said Monday that there’s “no excuse” for the technical problems facing the Obamacare health insurance website, and promised that all Americans would have health insurance coverage.

However, a recent Pew Research poll indicates that Americans may be lacking the same enthusiasm as President Obama. The poll conducted from Oct. 9-13 reported that nearly 46 percent of Americans found the health care exchanges were off to a bumpy launch.

Although President Obama has assured the American people that the issue will be resolved, it may seem that the tech difficulties are far more complicated than originally expected.

And as many continue to struggle with the myriad of glitches and impending tax penalties, some have taken to the Twitter-sphere to share their frustrations.

Now while the administration assures us that they can fix the problems soon.

It seems all anyone can really do is watch as the government explains their plans to resolve this mess.
