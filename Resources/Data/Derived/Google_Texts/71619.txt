Staffers and members of Congress celebrated their relationship with their pets on Thursday night as the Animal Health Institute organized the 18th annual Pet Night on Capitol Hill and the sixth annual Cutest Pet Contest on Capitol Hill contest.

New this year was a “claw-biting” twist: a two-part voting system.

A panel of local media personalities, including ITK columnist Judy Kurtz, narrowed the pets in each category down to five entries. The winner of the five was decided by an online vote from the public.

Matt Cournoyer, Warren's deputy press secretary, said he was proud to go home and tell Martini he was the cutest rabbit on the Hill. Cournoyer said Martini would probably celebrate his win with an extra helping of bananas.



Rep. Jeff Denham (R-Calif.) brought last year's victor, the bulldog Lilly, to help him announce this year’s winners.

“Lilly is very vain about her big win last year. We still have her poster hanging on the wall,” Denham said. “Let me just give this plug: It is important for us to have this fun.”

After the big reveal, appetizers were served, and Orion the cat, who is better known as Buttercup from the “Hunger Games” films, and Marti the dog, who plays Sandy in the modern remake of "Annie," posed for photos with fans.
