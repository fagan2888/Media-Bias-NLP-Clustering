Members of Asian American and Pacific Islander community from across the country joined together to ring in the first day of the Lunar New Year with keynotes from Administration officials, a discussion with diverse AAPI leaders, and three lively cultural performances. President Obama also sent his greetings by video message.\n\nTraditional Chinese Lion Dance, performed by the Wong People Association.\n\nSpeakers of the evening included Deputy Secretary of Labor Chris Lu and an armchair dialogue with Juliet Choi, Chief of Staff at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services; Tung Nguyen, Chair of the President\u2019s Advisory Commission on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders; and Sam Yoon, former Senior Advisor at the U.S. Department of Labor.
