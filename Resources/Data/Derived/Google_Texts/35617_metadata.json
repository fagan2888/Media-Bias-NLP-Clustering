In a study just published on the Brookings Institution\u2019s Web site, Ian Hathaway and I found that the share of mature firms, or those at least 16 years old, rose 50 percentage points between 1992 and 2011, from 23% to 34% of all firms in the U.S. economy. Not surprisingly, the share of all private-sector workers employed in such mature firms rose over the same time, from 60% to 72%. Older firms may have more experience, but they are less likely to develop and commercialize the path-breaking innovations more characteristic of younger firms (think of the car, the airplane, air-conditioning, computers, Internet search). Yet Ian and I found that one of the main reasons for the aging firm structure is the declining share of not only startups but firms of all age groups short of the 16-year mark.\n\nThis Brookings study suggests that we\u2019ve lost our entrepreneurial culture, which is a big part of what drives productivity increases. While the aging curve\u2019s demographic shifts are more or less fixed at this point, Jim Pethokoukis writes often about other ways we could avoid stifling startups, like eliminating regulations that shield incumbents from competition and ending \u201ctoo big to fail,\u201d which distorts the financial system in a way that hurts small startups that need loans.\n\nAgain, Friday\u2019s jobs report was decent but . . . low-wage workers aren\u2019t getting the hours they need. Is Obamacare to blame?\n\nFor the Upshot, Neil Irwin breaks down last Friday\u2019s jobs report. He writes:\n\nThe new jobs numbers are a mild disappointment, with emphasis on the mild. Yes, the total of 209,000 jobs reported to have been added to United States payrolls was a bit below the 230,000 economists were expecting, and well below the revised 298,000 of June. And yes, the unemployment rate ticked up to 6.2 percent from 6.1 percent. But those numbers are hardly the stuff of catastrophe, and the fine print Friday was more positive. Revisions to previous months\u2019 job growth numbers were slightly positive, for example, and the unemployment rate rose because some 329,000 people joined the labor force, driving up the labor force participation rate a bit. The result: Nothing about these numbers should change your basic assessment of how the economy is doing, unless you had some outlandish view of how the economy was doing to begin with. Gradual, steady expansion in the job market, and the economy more broadly, continues apace\u2026 Add it all up, and average weekly earnings rose only a trivial amount, up 35 cents a week, or four one-hundredths of a percent. Inflation data for July has not been published yet, but based on recent readings, the 2 percent gain in private-sector hourly pay over the last 12 months is barely enough to keep up with rising prices. A new report Friday, for example, showed a 1.7 percent rise in consumer prices for the 12 months ended in June.\n\nThe uptick in labor-force participation, however tiny it is, is encouraging, since the departure of a number of of prime-age males from the broader job market has been one of them most devastating effects of the recession.\n\nBut there\u2019s another trend going on that isn\u2019t necessarily showing up in the BLS data, which looks at the overall labor market and individual industries. The state of the job market looks considerably worse when looking at the low-wage job market, it turns out.
