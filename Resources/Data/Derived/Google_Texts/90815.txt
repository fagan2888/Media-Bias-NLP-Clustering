The Kansas Department of Revenue has banned employees from making audio, video or photographic recordings while at work.

The Topeka Capital-Journal reports that violations could lead to firings.

Agency spokeswoman Jeannine Koranda says the policy is formalizing what has already been the practice at the agency. Koranda declined to say whether a specific incident or incidents prompted the policy to be put into place. The restrictions, which took effect earlier this month, have raised concerns.

Kansas Organization of State Employees director Rebecca Proctor says workers often make recordings to aid in proving harassment claims. The recording ban provides no exception for gathering evidence of wrongdoing, such as sexual harassment or financial misconduct.

And Washburn University law professor Joseph Mastrosimone says the policy may conflict with Kansas' whistleblower protection law.
