So van Slooten sat in a radio booth night after night, paying close attention to Twins games and waiting to hit \u201cplay\u201d on local commercials whenever Herb Carneal and John Gordon went to a between-innings break.\n\n\u201cI was a fan of Chili Davis,\u201d van Slooten recalls. \u201cI sat there and listened every night, and I just really got into baseball.\u201d\n\nNow he is immersed in baseball like few others. The game and its history lend themselves to statistical quantification that no other sport can match, and if those millions of numbers have an epicenter, these days it\u2019s in the small office of his St. Paul home. Or maybe his couch, if the Twins are on TV.\n\n\u201cPeople talk about their dream job \u2014 this is one of those things where you fall into something and I can\u2019t imagine wanting to do something else,\u201d van Slooten said. \u201cIt\u2019s not something I planned.\u201d\n\nBut this spring, it became his reality. In the Internet age, there is no more credible and ubiquitous website in baseball than Baseball-Reference.com, the go-to encyclopedia for fans, researchers and media members. And van Slooten, a 39-year-old native Minnesotan and Twins partial season-ticket holder, is now in charge of the site\u2019s day-to-day operations.\n\n\u201cMaintaining the site is a huge responsibility, because we have millions of users, people that rely on it on a daily basis,\u201d van Slooten said. \u201cIt\u2019s our biggest site, our best-known site, and it\u2019s the sport that I truly love.\u201d\n\nVan Slooten\n\nTo millions of fans, loving baseball means loving the numbers it generates, and that thirst for mathematical exploration has exploded in the Internet era, even among players themselves. \u201cYou don\u2019t play for statistics, by any means, but I think most players are aware of some of the numbers. It\u2019s pretty hard to miss them on the scoreboard,\u201d Twins manager Paul Molitor said. \u201cWe try to use them to help us understand how we can better succeed. \u2026 There are a lot of fans out there who really enjoy tracking them.\u201d\n\nVan Slooten was one, joining the Society for American Baseball Research (SABR) and reading various analyses on the web, but he had no ambitions to turn that fondness into a career. After graduating high school in Little Falls, he went to college at Illinois, got a degree in computer science and took a job in Chicago, managing software developers.\n\nHe and his wife moved back to Minnesota in 2011, but van Slooten soon grew tired of his job. When Sean Forman, a former math professor at St. Joseph\u2019s University in Philadelphia and founder in 2000 of the reference websites, advertised for a developer to run Hockey-Reference.com, van Slooten made a career change and joined Forman\u2019s six-man staff. Fifteen months later, Forman decided to focus on managing the company, which now covers seven pro and college sports, and promoted van Slooten to the baseball site.\n\nNow he\u2019s getting comfortable with his role as a curator of more than a century\u2019s worth of baseball facts and minutia. (With the help of another website, Retrosheet, B-R has boxscores for every game back to 1914, and most of them back to the 1870s.) He spends part of each day debugging the daily updates that Baseball-Reference.com receives from MLB and other leagues \u2014 the site now warehouses statistics from every professional minor league, along with leagues in Japan, Cuba, Mexico and several other countries \u2014 and making constant improvements to the site. \u201cWe want to keep it simple, for users who just want to look up Derek Jeter\u2019s RBIs,\u201d van Slooten said, \u201cbut also make available the most advanced statistics out there.\u201d\n\nAlong with Forman, he is also working to create a better mobile app, to reach \u201cour largest growing base. With fans sitting in front of their phones with their iPads, to being at games and looking up stats dynamically, we\u2019re well aware that mobile is our next big opportunity,\u201d he said. They are also trying to determine how to present a treasure trove of new, technical data that baseball has begun collecting, measuring virtually every move on the diamond.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing how much information is out there,\u201d van Slooten said. \u201cBut it\u2019s baseball, so there\u2019s an audience for all of it.\u201d\n\nCENTRAL INTELLIGENCE\n\nThe White Sox retired Paul Konerko\u2019s No. 14 before Saturday\u2019s game with the Twins, just one year after he retired. That\u2019s unusual in the AL Central, a division where most retired numbers belonged to players from long-ago eras. A look at the division\u2019s other retired numbers:\n\nIndians: An extreme example of retired-number stinginess: Six players have had their numbers retired, but none played in Cleveland more recently than Larry Doby (No. 14) in 1958. The Indians did \u201cretire\u201d No. 455 in 2001, to honor the fans for 455 consecutive sellouts.\n\nRoyals: The franchise retired three numbers \u2014 George Brett\u2019s No. 5, Frank White\u2019s No. 20 and manager Dick Howser\u2019s No. 10 \u2014 from their glory days in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Considering the Royals went 29 years between postseason appearances, it\u2019s understandable that there aren\u2019t more.\n\nTigers: Another franchise that doesn\u2019t retire numbers for recent players, Detroit\u2019s only such honor for someone active since the 1970s isn\u2019t for a player. The Tigers retired No. 11 five years ago for manager Sparky Anderson.\n\nWhite Sox: The White Sox have retired 10 numbers, including four (counting Konerko) of players who were active in the past 20 years (Carlton Fisk\u2019s No. 72, Frank Thomas\u2019 No. 35, Harold Baines\u2019 No. 3). Of course, this is a franchise that likes to retire numbers; the White Sox set aside Baines\u2019 in 1989 \u2014 more than a decade before he retired himself.\n\nSTATISTICALLY SPEAKING\n\n\n\nWho needs a DH?\n\nOn Wednesday in Pittsburgh, Mike Pelfrey became only the sixth Twins pitcher since the DH rule was adopted in 1973 to collect two hits in a game (Eric Milton did it twice). But he\u2019s not yet among the seven pitchers who have three career hits. The Twins\u2019 post-1973 hit leaders among pitchers:\n\nJohan Santana, 8\n\nEric Milton, 6\n\nKyle Lohse, 4\n\nJoe Mays, 4\n\nBrad Radke, 3\n\nCarl Pavano, 3\n\nScott Baker, 3\n\nPart of the 199 Club\n\nWith his home run Saturday, Torii Hunter needs one more homer to become the eighth player to hit 200 home runs in a Twins uniform. The seven ex-Twins ahead of him:\n\nHarmon Killebrew, 475\n\nKent Hrbek, 293\n\nJustin Morneau, 221\n\nTony Oliva, 220\n\nBob Allison, 211\n\nKirby Puckett, 207\n\nGary Gaetti, 201\n\nSource: baseball-reference.com", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "To millions of fans, loving baseball means loving the numbers it generates, and that thirst for mathematical exploration has exploded in the Internet era, even among players themselves.", "title": "MLB Insider: All of baseball's stats converge in St. Paul", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/all-the-stats-converge-in-st-paul/304833281/", "image": {"url": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_143242972213096.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "width": 1200, "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_143242972213096.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "twitter": {"description": "To millions of fans, loving baseball means loving the numbers it generates, and that thirst for mathematical exploration has exploded in the Internet era, even among players themselves.", "title": "MLB Insider: All of baseball's stats converge in St. Paul", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/all-the-stats-converge-in-st-paul/304833281/", "image": {"src": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_143242972213096.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_143242972213096.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "description": "To millions of fans, loving baseball means loving the numbers it generates, and that thirst for mathematical exploration has exploded in the Internet era, even among players themselves."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbd06\"", "article_summary": "He and his wife moved back to Minnesota in 2011, but van Slooten soon grew tired of his job.\nAnd van Slooten, a 39-year-old native Minnesotan and Twins partial season-ticket holder, is now in charge of the site\u2019s day-to-day operations.\n\u201cBut it\u2019s baseball, so there\u2019s an audience for all of it.\u201dCENTRAL INTELLIGENCEThe White Sox retired Paul Konerko\u2019s No.\n\u201cI was a fan of Chili Davis,\u201d van Slooten recalls.\n\u201cPeople talk about their dream job \u2014 this is one of those things where you fall into something and I can\u2019t imagine wanting to do something else,\u201d van Slooten said."}
