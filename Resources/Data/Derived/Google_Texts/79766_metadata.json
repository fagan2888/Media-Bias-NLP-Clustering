She dominated last week\u2019s \u201cHappy Hour\u201d debate for GOP hopefuls who didn\u2019t make it to the main Thursday night event and won the night. But with low name recognition and a huge field, the former Hewlett-Packard CEO needs more than a win once-a-month debate to propel her into the public\u2019s consciousness.\n\nEnter Donald Trump. The cranky billionaire currently leading the Republican primary polls is a media magnet. Outsized and outrageous, he commands headlines and airtime and has the ability to suck all the oxygen out of the room \u2013 unless you can get him to start blowing his hot air in your direction.\n\nRelated: Trump\u2019s Campaign Rumbles Onward\n\nIt wasn\u2019t by accident that Kentucky Senator Rand Paul, whose poll numbers have been falling dramatically, went out of his way to attack Trump within moments of the debate beginning on Thursday. Paul all but lunged over the podium in an effort to be the first of the 9 contenders surrounding Trump to attack him.\n\nIn the end, it didn\u2019t benefit him much. Trump snapped back with a comment about the money he said he had given Paul\u2019s campaigns over the years, and the debate moved on.\n\nBut Fiorina, between comments directly attacking Trump in the early debate Thursday and others made during the Sunday shows yesterday, appears to have got herself under The Donald\u2019s skin.\n\nDuring last week\u2019s debate, when she was asked whether Trump had gotten the best of the rest of the GOP field thus far, she snarked, \u201cI didn\u2019t get a phone call from Bill Clinton before I jumped in the race. Did any of you get a phone call from Bill Clinton? Maybe it\u2019s because I hadn\u2019t given money to the foundation or donated to his wife\u2019s senate campaign.\u201d\n\nRelated: Some in GOP Prepare to Dump Trump to Save the Party\n\nFiorina was referring to a Washington Post revelation that Trump had received advice on a potential presidential run from former Democratic President Bill Clinton. But she quickly turned to more substantive criticism.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s the thing that I would ask Donald Trump, in all seriousness, because he is the frontrunner right now and good for him,\u201d she said. \u201cI think he\u2019s tapped into an anger that people feel. They\u2019re sick of politics as usual. You know, whatever your issue, your cause, your festering problem that you hoped would be resolved, the political class has failed you. That\u2019s just a fact and that\u2019s what Donald Trump taps into. I\u2019ll just say this. Since he has changed his mind on amnesty, on health care and on abortion I would just ask, \u2018What are the principles by which he will govern?\u2019\u201d\n\nWhen Trump went on CNN after the Thursday debate to defend his performance, in which he tangled with moderators and refused to rule out running as a third-party candidate, he also criticized moderator Megyn Kelly for being excessively hard on him. She was angry, he said, \u201cYou could see there was blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her\u2026wherever.\u201d\n\nTrump critics immediately accused him of insinuating that Kelly was menstruating at the time of the debate and might have been overly emotional. Trump angrily denied he had meant any such thing. But sensing weakness his opponents did not let up. Nor did Fiorina.\n\nRelated: Fiorina Trumps Six Other Candidates in \u2018Happy Hour\u2019 Debate\n\nMr. Trump: There. Is.

Give me a break. She\u2019s got zero chance.\u201d But it was confirmed Sunday afternoon when Trump took the time to mean-tweet the former CEO.\n\nRelated: Trump \u2013 What Doesn\u2019t Kill Him Makes Him Stronger\n\nI just realized that if you listen to Carly Fiorina for more than ten minutes straight, you develop a massive headache.

Without rendering any judgment on whether Donald Trump is a worthy enemy in a moral or philosophical sense, it\u2019s obvious in the context of the GOP primary that having him as an enemy is potentially a big public relations victory for Fiorina.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The cranky billionaire currently leading the Republican polls was already under fire for sexism.
