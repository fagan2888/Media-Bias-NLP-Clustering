Rapper Common and singer John Legend have already won a Golden Globe for Best Original Song with their "Selma" track "Glory" and now, the two artists are setting their sights on an Oscar and are aiming to become only the third hip hop act to ever win Best Original Song at the Oscars.



The history of hip hop at the Academy Awards is a very short one and only dates back to 2002. It was 13 years ago that Eminem became the first hip hop act to be nominated and win Oscar for Best Original Song with his hit "Lose Yourself" from "8 Mile."



At the 2003 Academy Awards, hip hop wasn't featured in the category but it wouldn't take long for it to make its return as Three 6 Mafia were nominated in 2005 for "It's Hard Out Here for a Pimp" from "Hustle & Flow."



Just like Eminem did in 2002, the rap group became the second hip hop act to win Best Original Song, but the Memphis group took it one step further and also became the hip hop at to perform at the ceremony.



Since Three 6 Mafia's historic night in 2005, hip hop has remained scarce at the awards show. British rapper M.I.A. was featured on the 2009 nomination "O... Saya" from "Slumdog Millionaire," while Pharrell Williams was nominated in 2013 for "Happy" from "Despicable Me."



Tune in to the 87th Academy Awards on Feb. 22 to see if Common and John Legend can add theirselves to hip hop history.
