Amazon got seven props; FitBit got eight; and WebMD, four.\n\nThe writers, Tom Main and Adrian Slywotzky, both partners in Oliver Wyman, describe a new reality \u2014 they call it Health Market 2.0 \u2014 being nurtured almost unwittingly by hundreds of tech startups seizing opportunities to make money by fulfilling needs that consumers are just now realizing they have. On the front lines of this new reality: fast-emerging health care companies that know exactly what they are going after \u2014 and none of the companies is a traditional provider organization.\n\n\u201cThis revolution is cast in players like Samsung and Apple and Google and Walgreen\u2019s and Wal-Mart, etc.,\u201d Main says. \u201cI wish it could have been played through by the incumbents reinventing themselves on their own without outside pressure, but I actually don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to happen.\u201d\n\nMain shared his thoughts on how the consumer revolution will play out.\n\nH&HN: Consumers are paying more out-of-pocket for health care, but they frequently do not have the information they need to make well-informed shopping decisions about health care providers. How do you see this evolving?\n\nMain: I actually think transparency is going to push its way into the scene at a national scale, and I see this happening in multiple layers.\n\nOne part of the marketplace today lives in an economic formula that works for the consumer, and this is convenient care. This is for the sore throats, the earaches, the bumps, bruises, rashes, the millions and millions of transactions that work fine in a fee-for-service type of environment. We already have a motivated buyer and motivated players that want to redefine how the market works.\n\nPrimary care physicians tell me that 70 percent of what\u2019s done in primary care can be done by a nonphysician and does not have to be done in a primary care office. So Walgreens, Wal-Mart, Teledoc, American Well \u2014 this whole collection of players in kiosks and telehealth and retail \u2014 are motivated to move this transactional, convenient care volume out of primary care offices.\n\nSo if, say, Walgreens executives think they can capture 70 percent of that volume, is Walgreens going to be transparent about price? I think the answer is \u201cyes.\u201d About wait times, so you know how long you have to wait and you can find that out through your scheduling app? Yes. About their drug and generic formulary co-pay structure? Yes. About patient experience ratings and crowdsourcing? Yes.\n\nThat is because, for every consumer who comes through the store, they pick up the back-of-the-store pharmacy volume, which is a profit center. That is how they can monetize the consumer through a container of chicken soup or whatever the consumer needs to get better.\n\nSo, my view on the transparency for this convenient care layer is that it will be provided willingly by the retail players and the telehealth players and the kiosk players. And that will force the rest of the primary care marketplace to come and play.\n\nThe second layer of transparency will be procedural care \u2014 all ambulatory surgeries and the mildly invasive diagnostics. This will be driven by players like AmSurg, Surgical Care Affiliates and United Surgical Partners International because they have only upside. There\u2019s 70 percent price variation on ambulatory procedures, and they have demonstratively better outcomes and better patient experience than inpatient providers.\n\nUntil now, they have been shadow pricing inpatient providers because they make more money, but economics rule. One of them is going to figure out that the value of growing market share is more significant than the shadow pricing. When that happens, we are going to see transparent bundled payments on ambulatory surgery and diagnostics.\n\nH&HN: The \u201cquantified self\u201d movement \u2014 for example, using FitBit or the Apple Watch to track steps \u2014 is giving consumers more information about their health than ever before. What are the implications for the health care industry?\n\nMain: As consumers begin to understand their \u201cbody narrative\u201d (steps, sleep, calories, blood oxygen, etc.) it is going to dramatically change their understanding of their health and the importance of better living. Ultimately, consumers will be able to trade their body narrative for better pricing in the market \u2014 you know, a \u201csafe-driving discount.\u201d For example, if your activity tracker tells you that you have a habit of taking 10,000 steps a day and are really good about staying fit, an orthopedic surgeon in the future might give you a lower-cost bundled payment on a procedure \u2014 say, a knee replacement \u2014 because he or she would know that the likelihood of your full recovery would be much higher.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In a report called \u201cThe Patient-to-Consumer Revolution,\u201d the authors mentioned Apple 19 times in 37 pages.
