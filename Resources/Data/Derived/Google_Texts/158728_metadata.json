Mike Johanns. There are already five Republicans and two independents in the hunt.\n\nDomina said he doesn\u2019t believe he\u2019s \u201clate\u201d getting into the race, because as the only Democrat, he\u2019s basically running in the November general election.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve looked over the field and we think that\u2019s a reason to run,\u201d he said during his kickoff speech at the Capitol.\n\nHe said other candidates talk about reaching across the aisle, but he questions why there needs to even be an aisle. Bickering and negativity have taken over from both the left and right, he said, with a lack of leadership and statesmanship.\n\n\u201cWe are undeniably in a mess,\u201d he said. \u201cPartisanship has no place now. \u2026 Let\u2019s be united in a new coalition of Nebraskans. Not left. Not right. Not reaching across the aisle, but tearing the aisle out.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not that the Democratic Party is unimportant to him, he said later, but it doesn\u2019t define him.\n\n\u201cI just think people need to get to know me,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to find out I\u2019m a Nebraskan, I\u2019m an American and that the label doesn\u2019t fit. The label of Republican or Democrat or idealogue.\u201d\n\nHe said the Senate \u201ccannot be stuck in a debate of 40-year-old issues or questions that are ever present in human history.\u201d When asked later which issues he was referring to, he acknowledged it was abortion and \u201cany 40-year-old issue,\u201d referring to Pope Francis\u2019 comments that the Catholic Church shouldn\u2019t act narrowly on issues such as homosexuality and abortion. Domina said the pope has made it clear it\u2019s \u201ctime to move on.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need to do that with the Senate,\u201d he said in an interview after his announcement. \u201cIts job is not to perpetuate old issues.\u201d\n\nHe also said the Affordable Care Act should be fixed, not repealed, women must \u201csearch their soul\u201d and get scientific information before making a decision about abortion and sportsmen should have the right to enjoy weapons, but all constitutional rights have restrictions.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think private citizens should have the same weapons that we train our soldiers to use,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said the Keystone XL could be built if it\u2019s moved away from the Ogallala Aquifer, is twinned with the existing Keystone One pipeline and is run by a \u201cresponsible operator,\u201d not TransCanada, the Canadian company that has been fighting for five years to get the pipeline approved.\n\nDomina got emotional when he began his kickoff speech by saying, \u201cI am a Nebraskan.\u201d Later, he said he\u2019s a \u201cNebraskan through and through enough to be emotional about it.\u201d\n\nDomina noted he was responsible for getting two Nebraska public officials impeached, represented the state in a complex banking crisis and was the trial lawyer in a case in which Nebraska\u2019s property tax was declared unconstitutional. He was the special prosecutor in the impeachment of former University of Nebraska Regent David Hergert and former Attorney General Paul Douglas in 1984.\n\nHis Omaha law firm often represents people taking on large, multi-national corporations, insurance companies and banks. He won a $1.3 billion jury verdict for cattleman against the nation\u2019s largest slaughterhouse accused of manipulating prices, although the verdict was overturned on appeal.\n\nCorporations are not people, he said. and the billionaire class keeps growing while the middle class shrinks.\n\nFive banks shouldn\u2019t hold 65 percent of all money \u2014 \u201cwe must break them up, not let them break us down,\u201d he said \u2014 and crops and livestock shouldn\u2019t be controlled by three companies in each market, or food dominated by three companies.\n\n\u201cWe must take back our markets and restore real competition, not pay unfair taxes while Big Money escapes through thousands of tax loopholes in the nation\u2019s revenue bucket,\u201d he said.\n\nDomina said he decided to run for office because there\u2019s a limit to what a lawyer can do to address problems.\n\nHe was introduced by Lincoln Mayor Chris Beutler, who ran against Domina in the 1986 Democratic primary for governor. Beutler said Domina, a friend since law school, is a \u201cremarkable man.\u201d When things get hot on the campaign trail, candidates have a tendency to exaggerate, be uncivil and \u201cbe at your worst,\u201d Beutler said, due to the enormous pressure. But Domina was always fair, civil and on point, he said.\n\n\u201cWith a united approach and a fearless, strong voice to make our case, we can get great things done,\u201d Domina told supporters. \u201cWe can take down the oppressive, big corporations. \u2026 We can get rid of bad laws. \u2026 We can take out dirty politicians.\u201d\n\nContact Deena Winter at deena@nebraskawatchdog.org.
