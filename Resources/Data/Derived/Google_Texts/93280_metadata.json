Sander Levin (D-MI) while he was trying to grandstand and trash Obama during an unrelated House hearing.\n\nVideo:\n\nRep. Ryan (R-WI) used a hearing in the House Ways and Means Committee that was supposed to be about the HHS budget request to grandstand about President Obama and Obamacare.\n\nRyan said, \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t surprise you that we\u2019re more interested in talking about ObamaCare, especially given the president\u2019s remarks this week. Whatever the Supreme Court decides later this month, I think the lesson is absolutely clear: ObamaCare is flat busted.\u201d\n\nRep. Ryan accused Obama of dictating to Republicans instead of working with them, \u201cHere is the question I\u2019m trying to get at. Is the President going to stand up and wave I have a one-page bill? I have a one sentence fix is that going to be the administration\u2019s position, or is the administration going to be willing to work with Congress to find a way to give the American people more healthcare freedom?\u201d Later, Ryan suggested that the President would put concrete around his ankles and say my way, or the highway.\n\nRanking Democratic committee member Sander Levin (D-MI) laid it down on Ryan. Levin said, \u201cI am not surprised at the tone, but I find it so counterproductive. Mr. Chairman, you talk about two-sidedness. The two sides when you say you worry about the millions who will lose their insurance when it\u2019s your allies who brought the suit that would deprive them of insurance. You talk about concrete, having feet in concrete? That\u2019s exactly where you\u2019ve been in terms of ACA. Your feet have been in concrete, while you\u2019ve brought up bill after bill to try to destroy ACA, and when you say will the President by my way or the highway, that\u2019s precisely what has been your approach to ACA. Precisely. You\u2019ve never sat down with us to say how can we make some changes. Instead, you have been out to destroy ACA, and you say where\u2019s the President\u2019s plan when the President believes that that court will and should uphold the law. All you\u2019ve done is issue op-eds and bills, contradictory bills. You don\u2019t have a plan. Like you haven\u2019t had a plan for sixty years.\u201d\n\nPaul Ryan has nothing. Ryan is the person that John Boehner put in charge of coming up with the Republican Obamacare replacement bill, and he has produced nothing. No bills, no ideas, no legislative proposals, Rep. Ryan has made it clear that the Republican alternative to the ACA is to throw millions of people off of their health insurance.\n\nRyan did his best Darrell Issa impression, and he got smacked down for his efforts. Republicans think that they can take away health insurance from millions and blame President Obama. Paul Ryan was trying to set the stage for Obama to take the blame for the Republican plan to harm millions, but Rep. Levin delivered a dose of stone cold reality.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Paul Ryan got stopped dead in his tracks by Rep.
