One big one may be that many people are finding they just can\u2019t afford to pay for a policy, even if it means a potential penalty.\n\nAs the second round of open enrollment for individual health insurance draws to a close Sunday, the number of people signing up in Washington likely won\u2019t meet expectations.\n\nAnd though there are plenty of reasons for the lackluster turnout \u2014 technical problems with the Washington Healthplanfinder exchange website, confusion over renewals, higher-than-expected Medicaid enrollments, more people with jobs providing insurance benefits \u2014 many are staying uninsured because the cost of coverage is too expensive for them.\n\nWhile the Affordable Care Act strove to put insurance within everyone\u2019s reach through subsidies and by expanding Medicaid, that hasn\u2019t been enough for many people. Now state lawmakers are considering taking a closer look at the problem to help those who remain uninsured.\n\nSunday deadline to sign up for health insurance If you want health insurance in 2015, you need to select and make the first payment on the plan before 10 p.m. Sunday. Go to Healthplanfinder at www.wahealthplanfinder.org to enroll in the exchange. For enrollment help, contact the state\u2019s call center at 855-923-4633 or King County\u2019s help line at 800-756-5437.

Gowe St.\n\nNick Dobie has met some of the people who slip through the cracks between Medicaid and affordable coverage. Dobie works at Country Doctor Community Health Centers in Seattle\u2019s Capitol Hill neighborhood, helping people sign up for coverage through the Healthplanfinder exchange.\n\nA few weeks ago a woman in her early 60s came to the clinic to renew her coverage for 2015. The woman, who works as a waitress, had a plan last year that cost $42 a month with subsidies, but this year her coverage shot up to $110.\n\n\u201cShe just looked at me, and she\u2019s like, \u2018I can\u2019t do that. I can\u2019t make it work,\u2019 \u201d Dobie said. He\u2019s found that for many clients, their tax credits went down while monthly premiums rose.\n\nA woman in her mid-20s who works at a tech startup also wanted to enroll. She qualified for a $15-a-month subsidy, and the cost of the least-expensive silver-level plan \u2014 coverage that offers middle-of-the-road benefits \u2014 was $150 a month.\n\n\u201cI could just hear her trying to sort things out, but with rent and other expenses, she couldn\u2019t make it work,\u201d Dobie said. The woman was also paying student loans and recently had moved out of her parents\u2019 house.\n\nBoth of the women are going without insurance, which means they face a penalty on their tax returns next year for being uninsured.\n\nLast year, the exchange had more than 164,000 customers at the close of the first open-enrollment period in March.\n\nIn this second round of enrollment, which began in November, only 139,000 customers had signed up a few days before the Feb. 15 deadline. The state had set a goal of 213,000 customers.\n\nBethany Frey, spokeswoman for the Washington Health Benefit Exchange, which runs the insurance marketplace, advised people to shop around and consider changing plans if they need a cheaper option.\n\n\u201cIf people did see a decrease in their tax credit, it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean they have to pay more,\u201d Frey said.\n\nThe amount available in tax subsidies is pegged to the price of the second-cheapest silver plan sold in a customer\u2019s geographic area. That price decreased across Washington, so the subsidies shrank, too. The precise amount a person receives is determined by his or her income.\n\nMonthly premiums for exchange plans rose a modest 2 percent for 2015. But insurance prices also go up each year according to a customer\u2019s age.\n\nDespite the exchange\u2019s better showing last year, it appears that costs were a struggle then as well. Slightly more than half of the exchange customers missed at least one month\u2019s payment last year. And by the end of December, roughly 44,000 had outstanding balances on their accounts.\n\n\u201cWe hear there is an affordability issue,\u201d said Molly Firth, director of public policy with Community Health Network of Washington, an umbrella organization for community health clinics.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve heard it the last two years,\u201d she said. \u201cWe want to understand what is the problem and what is the solution to it.\u201d\n\nIn Olympia, state lawmakers are considering HB 1669 and SB 5625, legislation to conduct a study and form a task force to better understand the hurdles to coverage.\n\n\u201cThis is the first step (to) identifying why people aren\u2019t getting the care they need,\u201d said Rep. Marcus Riccelli, D-Spokane, sponsor of the House bill, which had a hearing Wednesday.\n\nSome of the solutions could include allowing nonprofit groups to pay the premiums for low-income people. Washington also could adopt the federal Basic Health Program, which provides additional subsidies for people who fall above the cutoff for Medicaid but below an income of up to 200 percent of the federal poverty level. An individual must make less than $16,105 a year to qualify for Medicaid.\n\nDespite their concerns, those working with low-income residents applaud aspects of the Affordable Care Act, particularly the expansion of the definition of who is eligible for Medicaid, locally called Apple Health.\n\nThe program, which used to cover only low-income children and elderly people, pregnant women, people with certain disabilities, and foster kids, and was a temporary aid to the neediest families, now provides health care for 1.7 million residents.\n\nThanks in large part to the Medicaid expansion, the rate of people uninsured in Washington dropped to 8.6 percent by last summer, down from 14.5 percent before the health-care overhaul, according to the state Office of the Insurance Commissioner.\n\nBut those people caught between Medicaid and affordable insurance will continue relying on charity care and community health clinics like Country Doctor for discounted prices for routine services.\n\n\u201cThe safety net is still here, and the safety net, unfortunately, continues to be needed,\u201d said Linda McVeigh, Country Doctor\u2019s executive director. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the disappointment with the Affordable Care Act.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "There are a lot of reasons sign-ups for individual health insurance are falling below expectations as the deadline for 2015 strikes on Sunday.
