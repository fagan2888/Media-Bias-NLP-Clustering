Jonathan Gruber, one of chief architects of the Affordable Care Act, has been caught in yet another recently discovered video saying that Congress was able to pass the massive healthcare law in 2010 “because Americans are too stupid” to understand its finer points.

The recently unearthed footage, which was aired Tuesday evening on Fox News, shows the MIT health economist explaining at an October 2013 event at Washington University in St. Louis that the bill contains several budgetary tricks that allows it to hide its true cost from the American voters.

"They proposed it and that passed, because the American people are too stupid to understand the difference,” Gruber said, referring to the "Cadillac tax" on certain health plans.

The video, aired on Fox News, comes on the heels of a separate 2013 video that was circulated online by American Commitment , a conservative activist group. Gruber can be seen saying in the American commitment video that the bill he helped draft was able to pass through Congress thanks to the “stupidity of the American voter" and a "lack of transparency."
