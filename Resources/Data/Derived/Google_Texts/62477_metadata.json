But the plans typically don\u2019t involve the Austin City Council.\n\nThe council Thursday will consider a resolution, introduced by Council Member Leslie Pool, that invites Australian sister city Adelaide to visit Austin for \u201can in-person ceremony\u201d and exchange of gifts.\n\nAustin would return a large opal brooch it received from Adelaide in 1983. Adelaide, which defied the rules of gift-giving etiquette earlier this year by asking for the opal back, has said it could give Austin a piece of Aboriginal art in return.\n\n\u201cWe will be sending back one item that\u2019s real important to them and receiving another \u2026 cultural artifact from them in return,\u201d Pool said during Tuesday\u2019s council work session.\n\nThe opal was commissioned decades ago as regalia for an Adelaide lady mayoress, but her successor thought the gem was bad luck and wanted to get rid of it.

Adelaide\u2019s newest lady mayoress became interested in the opal after researching her predecessors.\n\n\u201cIt goes without saying that the Austin City Council resolution is a wonderful gesture that is appreciated by The City of Adelaide,\u201d said a statement from Matt Halliwell, Adelaide\u2019s senior media adviser. \u201cThe opal is of great historical significance to Adelaide and having it returned would mean a great deal to the city.\u201d\n\nA letter from Adelaide\u2019s acting CEO said the city is celebrating its 175th anniversary and would put the opal on display.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Plotting to give an expensive piece of jewelry isn\u2019t unusual this time of the year.", "author": "By Andra Lim - American-Statesman Staff", "og": {"url": "http://www.mystatesman.com/news/news/local/austin-city-council-considers-returning-opal-to-au/npP3X/", "image": "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/img/photos/2015/11/17/2e/98/rbz-Sister-City-Opal-02.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Plotting to give an expensive piece of jewelry isn\u2019t unusual this time of the year.", "title": "Austin City Council considers returning opal to Australian city"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/resize/120x120/img/photos/2015/11/17/2e/98/rbz-Sister-City-Opal-02.jpg", "description": "Plotting to give an expensive piece of jewelry isn\u2019t unusual this time of the year.
