We need good, qualified teachers for exceptional student education.\u201d\n\n\u2756 \u2756 \u2756\n\nThe Program to Attract and Train Highly Qualified Exceptional Teachers for Students with Disabilities \u2014 or PATH \u2014 began three years ago through a U.S. Department of Education grant that paid for paraprofessionals already working in Hillsborough schools to earn their bachelor\u2019s degrees and become teachers.\n\nBut the program wasn\u2019t attracting enough people.\n\n\u201cDue to a lack of qualified and interested candidates, we received permission to expand our target audience for two years,\u201d Richman said.\n\nThe program puts teachers on a fast track to get certified for free to teach ESE. Those who enter PATH this spring will start teaching in August and will be fully certified by summer 2016. Nine future teachers are going through PATH now.\n\nPATH is similar to the school district\u2019s Science and Math Accelerated Readiness for Teaching program, which for the past three years has placed college graduates with degrees in science and math fields in classrooms.\n\nThe grant for that program runs out after this school year. It has placed about 130 science and math teachers in district classrooms.\n\nPATH offers a $2,250 scholarship and reimburses recipients for the costs of certification tests.\n\nTo become certified, special education teachers must take four exams \u2014 a general knowledge test, a professional education test, a subject area test and an ESE exam. Applicants attend five training classes that last six hours each. Those classes will be held on weeknights and Saturdays starting Wednesday.\n\nThey are then interviewed by a screening committee, which includes ESE supervisors, and will shadow a teacher for three days.\n\nOnce they\u2019ve been accepted into the program, participants must agree to teach at a high-needs school for three years.\n\nFor the first two years, each new ESE teacher will be paired up with a coach and a mentor. The teachers will continue to take classes throughout their first year and will be on tap to become fully certified in June 2016.\n\n\u201cThe goal is to not just say, \u2018Here\u2019s your keys, go teach,\u2019\u201d Richman said.\n\n\u2756 \u2756 \u2756\n\nAbout 45 prospective new math, science and special education teachers attended an information session Thursday night, where they got a rundown of the PATH and SMART programs and learned how to apply. The vast majority of the group was made up of ESE hopefuls.\n\nSome are already substitute teachers in district schools. Others have children of their own who have disabilities.\n\nSome do not have experience working with children with disabilities. Some, like Schroff, do.\n\nHe plans to apply for the program this spring and hopes to teach middle or high school social studies or science.\n\nRichman said after the nine current PATH participants went through training, his department decided to beef up the six-hour session on disability awareness to give applicants a deeper look at how to specifically teach students with special needs.\n\nPATH participants also take a 20-hour course in teaching students with disabilities once they\u2019ve been placed in a classroom, Richman said.\n\nAttending an information session, like the one held Thursday, is the first step participants must take to become teachers through the programs.\n\nSo far, 29 teachers have been employed through the PATH program. The goal is to hire 60 teachers in the next two years, Richman said.\n\nTeaching students with disabilities isn\u2019t for everyone, he said. It comes with significant challenges and the salary isn\u2019t any higher than the salary of a general education teacher.\n\n\u201cMake sure you know what you\u2019re getting yourself into,\u201d Richman told those in attendance. \u201cIt\u2019s about your ability to build relationships with children. That\u2019s what it comes down to. These kids have to trust that you have their best interest at heart.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to get them to want to learn from you.\u201d\n\nekourkounis@tampatrib.com\n\n(813) 259-7999\n\nTwitter: @ErinKTBO\n\nBecoming a special education teacher in Hillsborough County\n\nFor more information on the school district\u2019s Program to Attract and Train Highly Qualified Exceptional Teachers for Students with Disabilities, visit path.mysdhc.org/ , call 840-7032 or attend one of three information sessions coming up.
