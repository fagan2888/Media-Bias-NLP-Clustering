No matter how bold, broad and overarching a president\u2019s vision may be, a failure of details can sink the whole enterprise.\n\nJimmy Carter made a daring decision back in 1980 to launch Operation Eagle Claw, a helicopter-borne operation similar to the recent raid on Osama bin Laden\u2019s hiding place, to rescue the American hostages in Iran. Had it succeeded, Carter might well have been re-elected to a second term. Instead, somebody forgot that when sand gets into aircraft engines, they have a tendency to seize up. Eight Americans died in the operation, and nobody was rescued. Carter shouldered the blame, and was branded a loser.\n\nNow we have the Obamacare rollout fiasco, and once again, there\u2019s no question that the man at the top should be held responsible.\n\nNobody died as a result of this screw-up, though, and you can bet that behind the scenes, the sharpest geek minds in Silicon Valley have been drafted to straighten things out, pronto.\n\nMy guess is that a few months from now, the rollout mess will be a footnote. It\u2019s to be expected in today\u2019s toxic political atmosphere that opponents of the ACA will exploit the glitches to question the validity of the program as a whole, but that\u2019s only a short-lived cocaine rush.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Obamacare, ACA, Affordable Care Act, rollout, glitch, glitches, Obama, health care, Jimmy Carter, Osama bin Laden, Iran, website, Healthcare.gov, Chan Lowe", "og": {"site_name": "tribunedigital-sunsentinel", "description": "The job of president of the United States is so complex that the learning curve never ends, even when the occupant of the Oval Office has been awarded a second four-year contract. \u00a0 Each...", "title": "Obamacare rollout fiasco", "url": "http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2013-10-23/news/sfl-obamacare-rollout-fiasco-20131023_1_obamacare-rollout-tea-partiers", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-526838f2/turbine/sfl-chan-lowe-obamacare-fiasco-20131023-001/555/555x382", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100001837105818, "app_id": 143455335716926}, "description": "The job of president of the United States is so complex that the learning curve never ends, even when the occupant of the Oval Office has been awarded a second four-year contract. \u00a0 Each"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9d71\"", "article_summary": "Each president has to learn certain basics all over again for himself, as though he were born in a vacuum.\nNo matter how bold, broad and overarching a president\u2019s vision may be, a failure of details can sink the whole enterprise.\nMy guess is that a few months from now, the rollout mess will be a footnote.\nNow we have the Obamacare rollout fiasco, and once again, there\u2019s no question that the man at the top should be held responsible.\nInstead, somebody forgot that when sand gets into aircraft engines, they have a tendency to seize up."}
