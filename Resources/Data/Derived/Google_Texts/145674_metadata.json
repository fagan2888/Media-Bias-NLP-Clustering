One of these priorities is passing comprehensive immigration reform, but the way Biden chose to frame the issue has made headlines and raised plenty of eyebrows.\n\n\u201cWe have to pass an immigration bill,\u201d Biden said, as quoted by the Washington Examiner, which also obtained a recording of the segment. \u201cLook at Germany, look at the rest of the world. We\u2019re the only non-xenophobic nation in the world that\u2019s a major economy.\u201d\n\nIn a tweet by Detroit News DC Bureau Chief David Shepardson, the journalist said Biden went even further than that and added other countries in the mix, claiming that Germany, Japan, and China are all \u201cnot nearly as welcoming of immigrants\u201d as the US.\n\nBiden reportedly did not expand on his analysis, leaving many to question just how truthful it was. As noted by the German edition of The Local, the notion that Germany is hostile to immigrants doesn\u2019t fit in with the facts inside Europe\u2019s largest economy.\n\nBiden says Germany, Japan, China \"are not nearly as welcoming of immigrants\" as US \u2014 David Shepardson (@davidshepardson) June 10, 2014\n\nAccording to a May report by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), Germany has experienced a \u201cboom\u201d in immigration over the last few years, leapfrogging Canada and the United Kingdom to take second place as a top destination for migrants around the world, behind only the US. The OECD stated that between 2009 and 2012, permanent migration rose 38 percent as Germany moved up from eight place.\n\n\u201cSuch a strong increase from one year to another has been rarely observed in any major OECD country,\u201d Thomas Liebig, one of the study\u2019s authors, said to Bloomberg. \u201cWe can clearly speak about a boom of migration to Germany without exaggeration.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, The Local noted that new data from Germany\u2019s Federal Statistics Office show more than 15.3 million people out of the country\u2019s 81 million-strong population have a migrant background.\n\nBefore remarking on Germany\u2019s xenophobia, Biden said the US needed to invest further in a skilled workforce and infrastructure, bemoaning the current lack of consensus on the issue.\n\n\u201cWe have to invest in infrastructure,\u201d he said. \u201cThat used to be an overwhelming bipartisan consensus in the united states of America. For the past 150 years it\u2019s been a consensus; not at the moment.\u201d\n\nNotorious for making controversial statements or gaffes, Biden's comments regarding Germany aren't the first time he's been scrutinized. The vice president made waves in the past for being caught on a hot mic telling President Obama the Affordable Care Act is a \u201cbig f**king deal,\u201d announcing his support for gay marriage before the president himself, and making questionable comments like telling a politician in a wheelchair to stand up for an applause.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Vice President Joe Biden undoubtedly ruffled some feathers in Germany on Tuesday when he suggested the country was \u201cxenophobic\u201d and much less accommodating to immigrants compared to the United States.", "og": {"site_name": "RT International", "description": "Vice President Joe Biden undoubtedly ruffled some feathers in Germany on Tuesday when he suggested the country was \u201cxenophobic\u201d and much less accommodating to immigrants compared to the United States.", "title": "Biden to Germans: You are xenophobic", "locale": "en_EN", "image": "https://img.rt.com/files/news/28/6d/80/00/000_nic6330512.si.jpg", "url": "https://www.rt.com/usa/165592-biden-germany-xenophobic-speech/", "type": "article"}, "navigation": "tabbed", "twitter": {"description": "Vice President Joe Biden undoubtedly ruffled some feathers in Germany on Tuesday when he suggested the country was \u201cxenophobic\u201d and much less accommodating to immigrants compared to the United States.", "title": "RT International", "image": "https://img.rt.com/files/news/28/6d/80/00/000_nic6330512.si.jpg", "creator": "@RT_com", "site": "@RT_com", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "HandheldFriendly": "true", "format-detection": "telephone=yes", "msvalidate.01": "36879475773792950F4872586A371571", "google-site-verification": "VQLbsaWKiXW2-Vt4lP7MevnhMES537NO4fQjfGgLcbI", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "MobileOptimzied": "width", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd64b8\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThat used to be an overwhelming bipartisan consensus in the united states of America.\nVice President Joe Biden undoubtedly ruffled some feathers in Germany on Tuesday when he suggested the country was \u201cxenophobic\u201d and much less accommodating to immigrants compared to the United States.\n\u201cWe have to pass an immigration bill,\u201d Biden said, as quoted by the Washington Examiner, which also obtained a recording of the segment.\nThe OECD stated that between 2009 and 2012, permanent migration rose 38 percent as Germany moved up from eight place.\nOne of these priorities is passing comprehensive immigration reform, but the way Biden chose to frame the issue has made headlines and raised plenty of eyebrows."}
