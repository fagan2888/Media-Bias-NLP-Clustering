The union representing nearly 600 support staff of Naperville School District 203 will get pay increases over the next three years after the school board approved the agreement Monday. Naperville Education Support Professionals Association's 2013-15 contract expired June 30.

In the new contract effective retroactively to July 1, NESPA members will receive salary increases of 3.2 percent in the first year, 2.5 percent the second year and 2 percent the third. The contract calls for no step advancement.

The agreement also includes professional development more geared toward individual members and minor health benefit changes as the result of the Affordable Care Act, according to district officials.

NESPA is made up of school office staff; teaching and instructional assistants including special education, English language learners, reading and writing centers, career centers and library; computer support associates; health technicians; attendance specialists; and campus, auditorium, printing and warehouse supervisors.

They ratified the contract Aug. 19 with 94 percent of the membership voting in favor of the agreement.

"This contract solidifies the ongoing, collaborative effort between NESPA and the district. This is how collective bargaining is supposed to work," said Joan Merkin, NESPA president, in a press release.

Superintendent Dan Bridges said the district's educational support professionals play an integral role in educating and supporting students of District 203. "Every single day the members of NESPA help make Naperville 203 an exemplary district," Bridges said in a prepared statement.
