That catapulted Verenium shares by nearly 60%, to $3.98 in recent action, up from $2.51.\n\nIt is unclear how Verenium will be merged in with BASF, which does have a pharmaceutical division. A BASF spokesman said in an email that it\u2019s \u201ctoo early in the process to provide specifics about the integration.\u201d\n\nBut BASF said in a press release it is focusing on Verenium\u2019s strong emphasis on enzyme development, which can accelerate biological and chemical processes. BASF didn\u2019t respond to request for comments, but said in a press release that it would combined Verenium\u2019s \u201cscientific and technological excellence with BASF\u2019s enzyme activities and its global access into all relevant markets will strengthen BASF\u2019s footprint in the strategic enzyme growth market.\u201d\n\nBASF goes on to say that the enzymes can be used in a variety of applications, including the making of detergents, as well as human and animal nutrition. San Diego-based Verenium\u2019s emphasis on industrial biotechnology fits well with BASF\u2019s plans, as the company also has worked in grain processing and oilseed processing.\n\nWith an estimated 13 million Verenium shares outstanding, the deal is worth roughly $52 million.\n\n\u2013 Follow Russ Britt on Twitter @russbrittmktw\n\n\u2013 Follow Health Exchange on Twitter @MWHealthBlog", "article_metadata": {"article.created": "2013-09-20T15:08:02-04:00", "application-name": "MarketWatch.com", "twitter": {"domain": "Marketwatch.com", "description": "A seemingly unusual match comes to light as German chemical company BASF buys a small biotechnology company named Verenium Corp., sending Verenium's shares soaring.", "title": "German chemical giant BASF to buy small biotechnology company", "url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2013/09/20/german-chemical-giant-basf-to-buy-small-biotechnology-company/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/MWimages/MW-BI867_basf_2_MG_20130920134900.jpg"}, "site": "MarketWatch", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.author": "Russ Britt", "article.section": "Markets", "keywords": "BASF SE,biotechnology,enzymes,Verenium Corp.", "article.headline": "German chemical giant BASF to buy small biotechnology company", "msapplication-task": "name=SmartMoney;action-uri=http://www.smartmoney.com/;icon-uri=http://www.smartmoney.com/favicon.ico", "news_keywords": "BASF SE,biotechnology,enzymes,Verenium Corp.", "author": "Russ Britt", "article.page": "Health Exchange Blog", "description": "A seemingly unusual match comes to light as German chemical company BASF buys a small biotechnology company named Verenium Corp., sending Verenium's shares soaring.", "article.published": "2013-09-20T15:08:02-04:00", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "msapplication-tooltip": "MarketWatch", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2013/09/20/german-chemical-giant-basf-to-buy-small-biotechnology-company/", "app_id": 283204329838}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch", "image_count": 2}, "og": {"site_name": "Marketwatch", "description": "A seemingly unusual match comes to light as German chemical company BASF buys a small biotechnology company named Verenium Corp., sending Verenium's shares soaring.", "title": "German chemical giant BASF to buy small biotechnology company", "url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2013/09/20/german-chemical-giant-basf-to-buy-small-biotechnology-company/", "image": {"width": 569, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/MWimages/MW-BI867_basf_2_MG_20130920134900.jpg", "height": 398}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Health Exchange", "article.id": "BL-MW243B-1194", "article.updated": "2013-09-20T15:08:02-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc946c\"", "article_summary": "A seemingly unusual match came to light Friday when German chemical company BASF reached a deal to buy a small biotechnology company named Verenium Corp., sending Verenium\u2019s shares soaring.\nThat catapulted Verenium shares by nearly 60%, to $3.98 in recent action, up from $2.51.\nWith an estimated 13 million Verenium shares outstanding, the deal is worth roughly $52 million.\nSan Diego-based Verenium\u2019s emphasis on industrial biotechnology fits well with BASF\u2019s plans, as the company also has worked in grain processing and oilseed processing.\nIt is unclear how Verenium will be merged in with BASF, which does have a pharmaceutical division."}
