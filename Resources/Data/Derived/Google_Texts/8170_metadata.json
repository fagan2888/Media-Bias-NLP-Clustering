But shortly after that initial email went out, parents at Nova Classical Academy learned that the child was also in kindergarten.\n\nImmediately, some parents raised concern about the issue of gender identity being introduced to their 5- and 6-year old children. The concept, they believed, is too complicated for kindergartners to grasp.\n\nAnd although the school hadn\u2019t yet announced any new restroom policies, parents were concerned about their children using bathrooms with students of the opposite sex.\n\nIn their attempt to push back, parents grew frustrated with the school\u2019s response. At least 10 students, The Daily Signal learned, transferred to another school.\n\nOne mother, who asked to remain anonymous to protect her daughter\u2019s identity, said she transferred her child because the classmate was having a \u201ctraumatic\u201d effect on her daughter.\n\n\u201cOur daughter\u2014because she is a normal kindergartner who was raised in a family where we had some social norms regarding biological gender and sex\u2014now she\u2019s asking questions like, \u2018How does a boy become a girl when they\u2019re born with a penis?\u2019 She has two brothers, so she\u2019s wondering, how is this possible, as the boy is wearing a jumper and has ribbons and ponytails in his hair,\u201d her mother said.\n\nAnother mother, whose daughter is still in the same class as the gender nonconforming child, described a similar effect. That mother also requested to remain anonymous.\n\n\u201cShe said, \u2018Mom, I think you can choose if you want to be a boy or a girl,\u2019\u201d the second mother said.\n\n\u2018That Bothers Me\u2019\n\nSimilar to how the debate over transgender rights has caused a culture war in states such as Washington and South Dakota, the situation at Nova Classical Academy also caused a rift in the tight-knit community.\n\nThe school is a competitive public charter school that consistently ranks high in school ratings. When it was granted its charter, Nova Classical Academy requested a waiver so that a majority of its school board members would be parents instead of educators. One goal of doing so, parents told The Daily Signal, was to foster parental involvement and oversight of curriculum.\n\n\u201cWe as a school community go through processes that are very lengthy, but in the end it always ends up being a conversation and a win-win situation,\u201d one mother said. \u201cAnd this situation, this is not what happened.\u201d\n\nFor example, this mother explained, deciding when to begin the gender and sex curriculum required \u201ca long, painful process.\u201d\n\nEventually, parents and educators agreed the program would begin in fifth grade, and address the topic of being transgender in 10th grade. But now, they thought, that decision was being flipped on its head, and the school was bypassing parental input to introduce these topics starting at a younger age.\n\nParents were divided\u2014many fully supported the reading of \u201cMy Princess Boy\u201d and the curriculum that would go along with it. Some of those supporters launched a petition drive in which they and others\u2014some from outside communities\u2014could speak out.\n\n\u201cI am in favor of using materials such as this as part of the curriculum,\u201d wrote Stephanie Schweser. \u201cTeaching and promoting tolerance, understanding, and inclusion will better our school community and our community beyond.\u201d\n\n\u201cI fully support the reading of \u2018My Princess Boy\u2019 or another book that specifically addresses gender nonconformity,\u201d added Josephine Chung on the same petition. \u201cA book is a useful and necessary tool for educating our children.\u201d\n\nThose who objected were particularly concerned because Nova Classical Academy is a K-12 school. Although the school had not yet addressed bathroom policies, their 5- and 6-year-old children, some parents feared, might now be forced to share a bathroom with a senior of the opposite sex.\n\n\u201cWe are in a K-12 school, and that bothers me\u2014there are some bathrooms that are shared. So I could have my daughter in the bathroom and a senior,\u201d the mother whose kindergartner still attends the school told The Daily Signal, adding:\n\nIf we start to desensitize our children at a young age that it\u2019s fine\u2014and right now, I\u2019m not worried that something bad is going to happen to her in her elementary school, but that she would get used to this. And eventually she could get put in a situation where she could be in harm\u2019s way, because she\u2019s innocently in the bathroom with someone who intends to cause harm.\n\n\u2018Life Before and After Beyonc\u00e9\u2019\n\nTwo months ago, Dave and Hannah Edwards, the parents of the gender nonconforming student at Nova Classical Academy, went public with their story in an interview with radio host Jack Rice.\n\nDuring that interview, Hannah Edwards attempted to explain her son\u2019s identity.\n\n\u201c[W]hen we ask him what he prefers, he says, \u2018I\u2019m a boy and in my heart I\u2019m a girl.\u2019 And sometimes he\u2019ll say he\u2019s half and half, which is something you put in your coffee, but I say OK, that\u2019s great.\u201d\n\nHannah Edwards said the change began around the age 2 after her son watched Beyonc\u00e9 perform at the 2012 Super Bowl halftime show:\n\nI kind of think of it as life before and after Beyonc\u00e9. Pretty soon it turned into an everyday occurrence, wanting to watch this 10-minute halftime show. And he started tying his blankets on his head, and dancing like her, and watching his reflection in the fireplace glass. That was, I think, the first time I noticed. It started becoming less of \u2018he thinks this is interesting\u2019 and more of \u2018I am being Beyonc\u00e9; I am being a girl.\u2019\n\nThe Daily Signal attempted to speak with Gender Justice, a group that is working with the Edwards family. They did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn the radio interview, the Edwards suggested their child had been subject to bullying in the classroom, and thus, the gender curriculum was necessary. But the real problem, they said, stems from parents who objectied to the school\u2019s handling of their child.\n\n\u201cI would say his teacher has been pretty integral in stopping the bullying, at least in the classroom. I know that he comes to school now in the jumper, and that\u2019s within the last month,\u201d the child\u2019s father, Dave Edwards, said during the interview. He added:\n\nI feel comfortable with what\u2019s happening in his small, little classroom world. It\u2019s these other parents coming in and objecting or starting petitions. And I think that really comes from a place of fear and ignorance on their part.\n\n\u2018Understanding Gender Diversity\u2019\n\nEric Williams, the school\u2019s executive director, confirmed to The Daily Signal that in December, Nova Classical Academy invited the president of the National Association of School Psychologists, Todd Savage, \u201cto educate the staff and community about gender nonconforming and transgender students.\u201d\n\nParents who attended the event and spoke with The Daily Signal said they thought the session came from, in one parent\u2019s words, \u201d a very progressive perspective.\u201d\n\nDuring the session, Savage highlighted a number of \u201cschool issues\u201d that lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender students face.\n\nThe father who eventually removed his daughter from kindergarten at Nova Classical Academy over the situation said he had \u201cno problem\u201d with the presentation but thought it fell short in addressing his personal concerns.\n\n\u201cHe had some specifics about how transgender kids have been oppressed in the past, and I think they\u2019re legitimate,\u201d the father said of Savage. \u201cBut he didn\u2019t present anything in ways of addressing the argument of how the issue could be damaging for the education, especially of pre-adolescent kids. He didn\u2019t address that issue at all.\u201d\n\nIn an attempt to learn more, parents who objected to the book \u201cMy Princess Boy\u201d organized their own informational session with a conservative group, the Minnesota Family Council. Unlike the session with Savage, the school refused to associate itself with the event.\n\nMultiple sources told The Daily Signal that advocates of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender persons\u2014affiliated with Out Front, Gender Justice, and Transforming Family\u2014attended the session. Five minutes before the event ended, parents said, the LGBT advocates lined the hallways leading to the exit holding signs that read, \u201cWe love our transgender kids.\u201d\n\n\u201cA piece of that was hard, because I just wanted to say I love transgender kids, too,\u201d the father, who attended the meeting with an older daughter who continues to attend Nova Classical Academy, said. He added:\n\nThis was so obviously orchestrated; their only purpose was to try to be intimidating. And my eighth-grade daughter was intimidated. It caused her stress and anxiety. And if you look at the definition of bullying, the irony of this whole thing is, that qualifies as bullying.\n\n\u2018No One\u2019s Having That Conversation\u2019\n\nFour months after the lower school principal sent out the initial email, the situation is ongoing. In an attempt to quell concerns, Nova Classical Academy adopted an \u201cemergency\u201d policy for transgender and gender nonconforming students.\n\nA parent at the school said that policy states:\n\n1) Boys and girls may wear whichever uniform they want.\n\n2) Students requesting access to a bathroom conforming to his or her gender identity will be granted or denied permission on a case-by-case basis.\n\n3) Preferred gender pronouns also will be required on a case-by-case basis.\n\nSome parents were unhappy with the temporary solution and called on the school to answer one simple question: Will their elementary school children run into a student of the opposite sex in bathrooms and locker rooms?\n\nSo far, the school administrators have evaded that question by telling parents in a Q&A handout that \u201cno student or family has made that request.\u201d\n\nOther parents are asking the school more daunting question: What kind of impact does introducing the concept of transgender and gender identity have on their 5- and 6-year-old children?\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone has taken the time to think about what are the developmental stages of each age bracket and how might that superimpose something that is not natural into their development?\u201d the mother who removed her daughter from the school said. \u201cThat piece to me, as a mom, is really, really valuable. No one\u2019s having that conversation.\u201d\n\nThe mother added:\n\nIf physiologists and medical doctors don\u2019t quite understand gender fluidity, then why do we try to impose this on people who are just trying to figure out how to tie their shoe? It\u2019s not fair. It\u2019s not just.\n\nThe Daily Signal learned that as of the last school board meeting, some students have left the school since the dispute over \u201cMy Princess Boy\u201d began. And for the first time in Nova Classical Academy\u2019s 12-year history, applications were down significantly .\n\nIn an email to The Daily Signal, Dr. Eric Williams, executive director of Nova Classical Academy, sought to explain the decline.\n\nWhile it is correct that a handful of prospective parents have indicated that the reason they did not re-apply to Nova for the 2016-17 school year or declined offers of enrollment was due to the gender nonconformity issue at the school, there are multiple reasons that have contributed more substantially to the lower number of applications received at this time. For the first time in a almost 10 years, Nova did not host an annual School Showcase/Open House at our school this year\u2013 an event that typically draws 200+ prospective parents and their children. Also, this year we chose not to host weekly tours throughout the fall and early winter for families of children entering kindergarten through grade eight. These decisions were made almost exclusively on the basis of allocation of staff resources and the long waiting lists the school has year after year.\n\nAlthough the school eventually replaced \u201cMy Princess Boy\u201d with poems portraying a similar message, the three families who spoke with The Daily Signal said they fear there\u2019s no turning back.\n\n\u201cIt seems like they\u2019re very influenced by the way the culture is moving,\u201d said the mother whose daughter remains enrolled.\n\nShe and her husband said they intend to \u201cstick it out,\u201d but they\u2019re \u201ctrying to decide at what point is just too much.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe daily influence of this little boy, who very much looks like a girl, all the accessories \u2026 they\u2019re really doing it up with him,\u201d she said. \u201cBut for now we\u2019re feeling convicted to stay and be a part of the work of making sure that we did everything we could do save this school.\u201d\n\nSince publication, this article has been updated to reflect the number of students who transferred out of Nova Classical Academy because of \u201cnonconformity issues.\u201d An earlier version of this article also used the name of the student. We\u2019ve since removed it to protect the child\u2019s privacy.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "An elementary school in Minnesota confronts the issue of transgender rights when a kindergarten boy begins identifying as a girl.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "An elementary school in Minnesota confronts the issue of transgender rights when a kindergarten boy begins identifying as a girl.", "title": "Kindergarten Students Forced to Confront Gender Identity", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/iStock_000069281027_Full_Cropped.png", "updated_time": "2016-04-25T09:08:08+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/21nXtBX"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "An elementary school in Minnesota confronts the issue of transgender rights when a kindergarten boy begins identifying as a girl.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/iStock_000069281027_Full_Cropped.png"}, "title": "Kindergarten Students Forced to Confront Gender Identity", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Education", "tag": "k-12", "published_time": "2016-02-29T17:59:41+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-25T09:08:08+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "transgender Kindergarten, bathroom bill, transgender bill, transgender rights, lgbt, transgender, religious liberty, Nova Classical Academy, St. Paul, Minn,"}, "article_summary": "Details regarding the gender non-conforming student at the school, Nova Classical Academy in St. Paul, Minn., were kept confidential.\nBut shortly after that initial email went out, parents at Nova Classical Academy learned that the child was also in kindergarten.\nIn an attempt to quell concerns, Nova Classical Academy adopted an \u201cemergency\u201d policy for transgender and gender nonconforming students.\nIn an email to The Daily Signal, Dr. Eric Williams, executive director of Nova Classical Academy, sought to explain the decline.\nImmediately, some parents raised concern about the issue of gender identity being introduced to their 5- and 6-year old children."}
