Today, the colonial threat has been replaced by a different challenge: real estate developers.\n\nRamadhan Njoroge, a resident of Ngangarithi village, told IPS that his community\u2019s worst fears came to life this past January, when several smallholder families \u201cawoke to find markers demarcating land that we had neither sold nor had intentions to sell.\u201d\n\nThe markers, in the form of concrete blocks, had been erected at intervals around communal farmland.\n\nThey were so sturdy that able-bodied young men in the village had to use machetes and hoes to dig them out, Njoroge explained.\n\nIt later transpired that a powerful real estate developer in Nyeri County had placed these markers on the perimeters of the land it intended to convert into commercial buildings.\n\nThe bold move suggested that the issue was not up for debate \u2013 but the villagers refused to budge. Instead, they took to the streets to demonstrate against what they perceived to be a grab of their ancestral land.\n\n\u201cWe cannot have people coming here and driving us off our land,\u201d another resident named Paul Njogu told IPS. \u201cWe will show others that they too can refuse to be shoved aside by powerful forces.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was given this land by my grandmother some 20 years ago,\u201d he added. \u201cThis is my ancestral home and it is also my source of livelihood \u2013 by growing crops, we are protecting our heritage, ensuring food security, and creating jobs.\u201d\n\nBut Kenya\u2019s real estate market, which has witnessed a massive boom in the last seven years, has proven that it is above such sentiments.\n\nThose in the business are currently on a spree of identifying and acquiring whatever lands possible, by whatever means possible. It is a lucrative industry, with many winners.\n\nThe biggest losers, however, are people like Njoroge and Njogu, humble farmers who comprise the bulk of this country of 44 million people \u2013 according to the Ministry of Agriculture, an estimated five million out of about eight million Kenyan households depend directly on agriculture for their livelihoods.\n\nLand: The Most Lucrative Asset Class\n\nLast September, Kenya climbed the development ladder to join the ranks of lower-middle income countries, after a rebasing of its National Accounts, including its gross domestic product (GDP) and gross national income (GNI).\n\nThis woman, a resident of Ngangarithi village in central Kenya, uses fresh water from the surrounding wetlands to irrigate her crops. (Photo: Miriam Gathigah/IPS)\n\nThe World Bank praised the country for conducting the exercise, adding in a press release last year, \u201cThe size of the economy is 25 percent larger than previously thought, and Kenya is now the fifth largest economy in sub-Saharan Africa behind Nigeria, South Africa, Angola and Sudan.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Bank, \u201cEconomic growth during 2013 was revised upwards from 4.7 percent to 5.7 percent [and] gross domestic product (GDP) per capita changed overnight, literally, from 994 dollars to 1,256 dollars.\u201d\n\nThe reassessment, conducted by the Kenyan National Bureau of Statistics, revealed that the real estate sector accounted for a considerable portion of increased national earnings, following closely on the heels of the agricultural sector (contributing 25.4 percent to the national economy) and the manufacturing sector (contributing 11.3 percent).\n\nDavid Owiro, programme officer at the Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA), a local think tank, told IPS, \u201cKenya\u2019s land and property market is growing exponentially.\u201d\n\nHis analysis finds echo in a report by HassConsult and Stanlib Investments released in January this year, which found that the scramble for land in this East African nation is due to the fact that land has delivered the highest return of all asset classes in the last seven years, up 98 percent since 2007.\n\nLand prices in the last four years have risen at twice the rate of cattle and four times the rate of property, while oil and gold prices have fallen over the same period, researches added.\n\nAdvertised land prices have risen 535 percent, from an average of 330,000 dollars per acre in 2007 to about 1.8 million dollars per acre today. Thus, equating land to gold in this country of 582,650 sq km is no exaggeration.\n\nAccording to Owiro of the IEA, a growing demand for commercial enterprises and high-density housing in the capital and its surrounding suburban and rural areas is largely responsible for the price rise.\n\nGovernment statistics indicate that though the resident population of Nairobi is two million, it swells during the workday to three million, as workers from neighbouring areas flood the capital.\n\nThis commuter workforce is a major driver of demand for additional housing, according to Njogu.\n\nAs a result, two distinct groups who see their fortunes and futures tied to the land seem destined to butt heads in ugly ways: real estate developers and small-scale farmers.\n\nWhat Is Sustainable?\n\nWhile the land rush and real estate boom fit Kenya\u2019s newfound image as an economic success story, they run directly counter to the United Nations\u2019 new set of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), due to be finalised in September.\n\nThe attempt to seize farmers\u2019 land in Ngangarithi village reveals, in microcosm, the pitfalls of a development model that is based on valuing the profits of a few over the wellbeing of many.\n\nA farmer shows off his aloe plants, popular among farming families in central Kenya for their medicinal value. (Photo: Miriam Gathigah/IPS)\n\nFarmers who have lived here for generations not only grow enough food to sustain their families, they also feed the entire community, and comprise a vital link in the nation\u2019s food supply chain.\n\nTaking away their land, they say, will have far-reaching consequences: central Kenya is considered one of the country\u2019s two breadbaskets \u2013 the other being the Rift Valley \u2013 largely for its ability to produce plentiful maize harvests.\n\nIn a country where 1.5 million people experience food insecurity every year, according to government statistics cited by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), pushing farmers further to the margins by separating them from their land makes little economic sense.\n\nFurthermore, encroachment by real estate developers into Kenya\u2019s wetlands flies in the face of sustainable development, given that the U.N. Environment Programme (UNEP) has identified Kenya\u2019s wetlands as \u2018vital\u2019 to its agriculture and tourism sectors, and has urged the country to protect these areas, rich in biodiversity, as part of its international conservation obligations.\n\nFor Njogu, the land rush also represents a threat to an ancient way of life.\n\nHe recounted how his grandmother would go out to work on these very farmlands, decades ago: \u201cEven with her back bent, her head almost touching her knees, she did all this for us,\u201d he explained.\n\n\u201cWhen she became too old to farm, she divided her land and gave it to us. What if she had sold it to outsiders? What would be the source of our livelihood? We would have nowhere to call home,\u201d he added.\n\nAlready the impacts of real estate development are becoming plain: the difference between Ngangarithi village and the village directly opposite, separated only a by a road, has the villagers on edge.\n\n\u201cOn our side you will see it is all green: spinach, kale, carrots, everything grows here,\u201d Njogu said. \u201cBut the land overlooking ours is now a town.\u201d\n\nVarious other villagers echoed these sentiments, articulating a vision of sustainability that the government does not seem to share. Some told IPS that the developers had attempted to cordon off a stream that the village relied on for fresh water, and that children played in every single day, \u201cinteracting with nature in its purest form,\u201d as one farmer described.\n\n\u201cI am not fighting for myself but for my children,\u201d Njogu clarified. \u201cI am 85 years old, I have lived my life, but my great-grandchildren need a place to call home.\u201d\n\nVillagers\u2019 determination to resist developers has caught the attention of experts closer to the policy-making nucleus in Nairobi, many of whom are adding their voices to a growing debate on the meaning of sustainability.\n\nWilfred Subbo, an expert on sustainable development and a lecturer at the University of Nairobi, told IPS that a strong GDP is not synonymous with sustainability.\n\n\u201cBut a community being able to meet its needs of today, without compromising the ability of its children to meet their own needs tomorrow, [that] is sustainable development,\u201d he asserted.\n\nAccording to Subbo, when a community understands that they can \u201cresist and set the development agenda, they are already in the \u2018future\u2019 \u2013 because they have shown us that there is an alternative way of doing business.\u201d\n\n\u201cLand is a finite resource,\u201d Subbo concluded. \u201cWe cannot turn all of it into skyscrapers.\u201d\n\nEdited by Kanya D\u2019Almeida\n\nThis reporting series was conceived in collaboration with Ecosocialist Horizons", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/templates/ja_teline_iv_t3/images/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "description": "Taking away Kenyan farm land will have far-reaching consequences.", "title": "Farmers Fight Real Estate Developers for Kenya's Most Prized Asset: Land", "og": {"site_name": "Truthout", "description": "Taking away Kenyan farm land will have far-reaching consequences.", "title": "Farmers Fight Real Estate Developers for Kenya's Most Prized Asset: Land", "url": "http://www.truth-out.org/news/item/30967-farmers-fight-real-estate-developers-for-kenya-s-most-prized-asset-land", "image": "http://www.truth-out.org/images/images_2015_05/2015.5.25.Kenya.1.jpg", "type": "non_profit"}, "twitter": {"description": "Taking away Kenyan farm land will have far-reaching consequences.", "title": "Farmers Fight Real Estate Developers for Kenya&#039;s Most Prized Asset: Land", "image": "http://www.truth-out.org/images/images_2015_05/2015.5.25.Kenya.1.jpg", "creator": "@truthout", "site": "@truthout", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#000000", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "fb": {"app_id": 286391544774433}, "author": "Miriam Gathigah", "keywords": "Kenya, farming, agriculture, land use, land dispossession, land, food, Africa, Agriculture, farming, Food, land dispossession, land use", "google-site-verification": "EfgVxcdUDBF_Dd81ZBBw_J8FuRjGnvp9r2JAM9IhvUk", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "YES", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd33c0\"", "article_summary": "Today, the colonial threat has been replaced by a different challenge: real estate developers.\nFurthermore, encroachment by real estate developers into Kenya\u2019s wetlands flies in the face of sustainable development, given that the U.N.\nThis community is at risk of being displaced from their land by powerful real estate developers.\nA farmer shows off his aloe plants, popular among farming families in central Kenya for their medicinal value.\nAs a result, two distinct groups who see their fortunes and futures tied to the land seem destined to butt heads in ugly ways: real estate developers and small-scale farmers."}
