The report did not include states that operate their exchanges, such as California or New York.\n\nIn Maine, one of the 35 states relying on Healthcare.gov, monthly premiums for the benchmark silver plan largely held steady, with a 2 percent drop on average before tax credits that help eligible consumers to afford their coverage.\n\nA family of four earning $60,000 in Maine will spend an average of $407 a month for coverage in 2015, with tax credits, according to the report.\n\nIn 2014, 90 percent of the more than 40,000 Maine consumers who selected a Healthcare.gov plan qualified for financial assistance.\n\nThis year, Maine consumers have more choice in their coverage, according to the report. Mainers can select from three health insurers for 2015 coverage, up from two in 2014, and an average of 25 health plans in their county, an increase from 17.\n\nEnrollment for individual coverage opened on Nov. 15 and closes Feb. 15. So far, more than 350,000 new customers have selected plans for 2015.\n\nLast year, HHS also analyzed data for 48 states.
