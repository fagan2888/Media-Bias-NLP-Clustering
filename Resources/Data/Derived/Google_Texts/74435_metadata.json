Particularly after Ken Cuccinelli\u2019s downplaying of pro-life issues utterly failed to make him Virginia\u2019s next governor, you\u2019d think the GOP would learn that ignoring subjects their foes want them to ignore is a losing strategy. Alas, it appears these elephants never remember.\n\nTo run for Senate against incumbent Democrat Mark Udall, Colorado Republican Rep. Cory Gardner apparently took some pointers from Cuccinelli\u2019s campaign, but tragically seems to have only paid attention to its early days. In March Gardner renounced his prior support for state personhood initiatives because of their alleged potential to also restrict contraception, and now he\u2019s made another offering to appease the War-on-Women types:\n\nThe least loved institution in America today is the U.S. Senate, and one of the reasons it is reviled is a zero-sum approach to women\u2019s medical care. It\u2019s time we changed that and adopt modern policies that make sense instead of using women\u2019s medical issues as an election-year power play. One of the most rational ways for Washington to break this gridlock is to approve oral contraception for over-the-counter purchases by adults.\n\nSince \u201cthe pill\u201d was first approved 44 years ago, it\u2019s been one of the most proven and tested pharmaceuticals of our time. It is safe, reliable, effective, and presents very few risks or complications for the more than 10 million women who use it [\u2026] Since January 2011, an obscure provision of Obamacare has blocked insurers from covering OTC medicine without a prescription. If Democrats are serious about making oral contraception affordable and accessible, we can reverse that technical provision. Driving the price down for a safe medicine is a better way to provide access to adults who want it than President Obama\u2019s insurance mandate. Many women don\u2019t have access today in spite of the Obamacare mandate, and it violates religious liberty in the process. If a new generation of senators puts partisanship aside, we can protect the liberties of women to have easy access to affordable oral contraception at the same time we protect the rights of those with conscience objections.\n\nYou may recall our discussing this idea in 2012 when Louisiana GOP Governor (and likely presidential candidate) Bobby Jindal proposed it. Like Gardner, Jindal pushed this as a common-sense way to de-politicize birth control. But it was wishful thinking then, and it\u2019s no more viable today.\n\nCertainly, all pro-lifers should make clear we\u2019re not interested in taking away anyone\u2019s non-abortive birth control. One of the best ways to do that is to keep shouting from the rooftops facts such as Hobby Lobby providing 16 different types of contraception even before ObamaCare came along and dragged them into court for \u201cdictating female employees\u2019 fertility.\u201d\n\nBut attempting to punt on all contraception comes at a great cost: the lives snuffed out by those drugs that function as abortifacients. The earliest days of pregnancy may be the most politically scary ground for a politician to stand firm on, because that\u2019s when people seem the least human to the uninformed, and because pro-aborts have done so much to sow ignorance about whether there\u2019s even an embryo there to be destroyed prior to implantation. But if you\u2019re truly pro-life and sincerely believe these are victims in desperate need of protection, then how can you justify giving that misinformation campaign your tacit endorsement?\n\nMoreover, the abortion lobby doesn\u2019t believe in political cease-fires. As I argued regarding Jindal:\n\nAs a matter of policy, pro-aborts\u2019 thorough bastardization of the word \u201caccess\u201d proves that fewer legal obstacles to purchasing birth control won\u2019t appease them. Only unconditional surrender on unfettered abortion, taxpayer-subsidized birth control, and forced private coverage of both will satisfy them. Sure, pharmacists would no longer have to worry about prescribing contraception, but all that means is that the Abortionquisition would refocus its wrath on those who choose not to stock it.\n\nSince then, pro-aborts\u2019 scorched-earth approach to abortion-on-demand has only intensified. They\u2019re so enraged by pregnancy centers that exist to provide more choices than abortion that they\u2019ve pushed legislation to silence them. They\u2019ve tried to criminalize the act of telling the truth about their political candidates. They\u2019ve openly argued that medical practitioners don\u2019t even have the right not to participate in abortion.\n\nAnd just this week, we saw the Supreme Court strike down Massachusetts\u2019s 35-foot buffer zone around abortion clinics, yet the fact that not even one of the pro-choice activist Justices could devise an excuse to dissent hasn\u2019t fazed these people. Where a halfway self-aware pro-choicer would have taken the \u201cunanimous\u201d part as a wake-up call, Planned Parenthood Federation of America president Cecile Richards instead deployed the usual bluster about \u201cthis decision show[ing] a troubling level of disregard for American women.\u201d Yes, tell us more about how Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Elena Kagan, and Sonia Sotomayor sold out to the patriarchy.\n\nThese are the hallmarks not of a movement that strongly disagrees with us, but of one that can\u2019t stand having to share a country with us\u2014and that has no qualms about using the law to do something about it. If he really wants to be a senator, Congressman Gardner should think long and hard about whether this bunch is likely to appreciate olive branches.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Live Action News", "description": "5 Like3 Tweet0 +12If an elephant never forgets, then maybe it\u2019s time for the Republican Party to get a new mascot.
