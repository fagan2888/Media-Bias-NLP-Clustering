Chris Christie suggested though didn\u2019t propose in his State of the State, would increase that imbalance. The report suggests the state instead reverse a cut made in 2010 to the earned income tax credit for the working poor.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s bad enough trying to survive on limited incomes in high-cost New Jersey, but it\u2019s shameful that the state\u2019s tax policies continue to levy the heaviest burden on those struggling the most,\u201d MacInnes said.\n\nEleven states and the District of Columbia were deemed fairer than New Jersey \u2013 in order, Delaware, D.C., California, Oregon, Montana, Vermont, Minnesota, Maine, Idaho, West Virginia, New York and South Carolina \u2013 and 38 states less fair.\n\nThe report says New Jersey\u2019s poorest households pay 10.7 percent of their income toward taxes, primarily due to property taxes\u2019 impact on their rent but also due to sales and excise taxes.\n\nMeanwhile, the richest households pay 7.1 percent of their income toward state and local taxes, the study found. The levy would be much closer to a level balance if not for the tax-lowering benefit wealthy households receive by using federal income taxes to partially offset their taxes by itemizing deductions.\n\nHouseholds in that wide range in the middle, with incomes between $22,000 and $758,000, generally experience an overall tax bill amounting to around 9 percent of income, though the report says people with incomes between $119,000 and $263,000 have a slightly lower bill through the federal offset.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://on.app.com/1IKO7S7", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "New Jersey\u2019s state and local tax system is fairer than most states, though low- and middle-income residents still devote a larger share of their income to taxes than the wealthy.", "og": {"site_name": "Asbury Park Press", "description": "New Jersey\u2019s state and local tax system is fairer than most states, though low- and middle-income residents still devote a larger share of their income to taxes than the wealthy.", "title": "NJ\u2019s tax system fairer than most, though still unequal", "url": "http://www.app.com/story/news/politics/new-jersey/2015/01/14/nj-tax-system-fairness-study/21757687/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/app.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "New Jersey\u2019s state and local tax system is fairer than most states, though low- and middle-income residents still devote a larger share of their income to taxes than the wealthy.", "title": "NJ\u2019s tax system fairer than most, though still unequal", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b5b1cd763e05d342148794bd75970cbc1e76ba03/c=154-0-836-682&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/AsburyPark/2015/01/14/B9315864311Z.1_20150114135740_000_GG89M4PCS.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@AsburyParkPress", "site": "@AsburyParkPress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600068887", "fb": {"app_id": 116172675120111}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/mgsymons"}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "new jersey taxes, nj tax fairness, new jersey policy perspective, christie income taxes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb242\"", "article_summary": "New Jersey\u2019s state and local tax system is fairer than most states, though low- and middle-income residents still devote a larger share of their income to taxes than the wealthy.\nThe report suggests the state instead reverse a cut made in 2010 to the earned income tax credit for the working poor.\nNew Jersey Policy Perspective president Gordon MacInnes said an income-tax cut, as Gov.\nThe levy would be much closer to a level balance if not for the tax-lowering benefit wealthy households receive by using federal income taxes to partially offset their taxes by itemizing deductions.\nMeanwhile, the richest households pay 7.1 percent of their income toward state and local taxes, the study found."}
