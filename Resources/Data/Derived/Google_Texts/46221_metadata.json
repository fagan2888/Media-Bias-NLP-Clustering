The federal government would fully fund expansion for three years, before gradually drawing down to a 90 percent reimbursement rate by 2020.\n\nOpponents, including Gov. Paul LePage and many Republican lawmakers, say Medicaid expansion carries hidden costs and that the state budget already suffers from previous program expansions.\n\nDuring the State House rally, several speakers said they could not afford private health insurance and did not qualify for subsidies available through the Affordable Care Act. The so-called coverage gap affects approximately 24,000 Mainers, or roughly 19 percent of the state\u2019s uninsured population.\n\nSeveral of them discussed their experiences on Wednesday.\n\nPete Miller, who lives in Ellsworth and is a prep cook at Pat\u2019s Pizza, said he cannot afford to buy private health insurance. He said he has a blood clotting issue that forces him to have his blood drawn regularly and to take blood-thinning medication. He had been on Medicaid \u2013 known here as MaineCare \u2013 for several years before losing his coverage at the end of December.\n\nAsked how much it would cost him to buy private insurance, Miller said, \u201cMore than I can make.\u201d\n\nJoseph Kubetz of Portland said he\u2019s in relatively good health but has no health insurance. He recently started a new landscaping business and worries that one accident or health setback could sink his business.\n\nTom Benne, a self-employed farmer from Whitefield, said he also fell into the coverage gap and lost his Medi- caid coverage in 2013. He had a hip replacement in 2012.\n\n\u201cIn 2010 my wife had a heart attack,\u201d Benne said. \u201cBecause of MaineCare she got the care she needed and made a full recovery. We lost our MaineCare on (Dec. 31).\u201d\n\nHe said they went to a navigator to try to purchase health insurance through the Affordable Care Act and discovered they couldn\u2019t qualify for subsidies.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in the gap. We\u2019re both in the gap,\u201d he said.\n\nAfter the rally, activists moved upstairs to lobby lawmakers between the House and Senate chambers.\n\nMike Tipping, a spokesman for the Maine People\u2019s Alliance, said the rally was one of the group\u2019s largest turnouts for a so-called \u201clobby day.\u201d\n\nNonetheless, advocates for expansion have a tough road ahead.\n\nBeth O\u2019Connor, chairwoman of Maine Taxpayers United, who joined members of that group at the State House Wednesday, said Maine had already seen the effects of Medicaid expansion. O\u2019Connor, a former state representative, said expansion would mostly benefit able-bodied Mainers.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to the front of the line,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd once again the 3,100 people (who are on a waiting list) are getting kicked back.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Connor added, \u201cFrankly it\u2019s a disincentive. People won\u2019t get off their butts and try to get a job. What we need to do is focus on the economy so that more people can find work.\u201d\n\nThree of the four Republican legislative leaders have said their resolve to fight expansion has stiffened since last session.\n\nIn 2013, an amendment expansion bill fell several votes short of overriding LePage\u2019s veto. The amendment, authored by Assistant Senate Minority Leader Roger Katz, R-Augusta, was designed to ease some Republicans\u2019 concerns over expansion by including a review of the program and a sunset provision that would roll back coverage if an independent study commission found that health outcomes didn\u2019t improve or the cost of managing the program was too high.\n\nRep. Kenneth Fredette, R-Newport, the House minority leader, said during a news conference Wednesday that his caucus had little reason to vote for expansion.\n\nFredette cited recent findings from a Harvard University study evaluating impacts of Medicaid during a long-term experiment in Oregon.\n\nThe study rebutted a key argument by expansion proponents that access to health care reduces emergency room visits. The Oregon study showed a net increase.\n\nJonathan Gruber, a health economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, told the Washington Post that the findings showed there was \u201ca misleading motivator for the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe law isn\u2019t designed to save money,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s designed to improve health, and that\u2019s going to cost money.\u201d\n\nAnother Harvard study last year found that Maine could prevent around 395 deaths per year by expanding Medicaid.\n\nFredette and Republicans remain unconvinced.\n\n\u201cIt seems every day we\u2019re hearing new reasons to reject this massive expansion of welfare and instead pursue reforms like the successful one passed by Maine Republicans in 2011,\u201d he said.\n\nLegislative Democrats, who have made Medicaid expansion a priority for the session, say they\u2019re undeterred.\n\n\u201cWhat we heard today is what we hear from our neighbors at home: People want and need life-saving health care,\u201d said House Speaker Mark Eves, D-North Berwick, in a prepared statement. \u201cThey don\u2019t understand why politics and ideology are holding up common sense care.\u201d\n\nSenate President Justin Alfond of Portland said there were moral and economic arguments for expansion. \u201cMaking sure folks have access to health care without the fear of going bankrupt is something we all value and it\u2019s something we will continue fighting for,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nDemocrats have cited several studies to bolster their pro-expansion arguments, including a study by the Kaiser Family Foundation that found that Maine is one of 10 states that would save money by expanding Medicaid.\n\nKaiser found that Maine would save $690 million over the next decade from Medicaid expansion.\n\nAnother study by the pro-health care reform group the Commonwealth Fund, said Maine could lose $294 million by 2020 by not expanding Medicaid.\n\nThat\u2019s because the federal government pays for Medicaid expansion with taxes on residents in all states, regardless of whether a state expands or not.\n\nA public hearing for the bill that would expand Medicaid will take place Jan. 15.\n\nSteve Mistler can be contacted at 791-6345 or at:[email protected] Twitter: @stevemistler", "article_metadata": {"description": "Passage of a bill that would expand the health coverage faces Republican opposition.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "description": "Passage of a bill that would expand the health coverage faces Republican opposition.", "title": "Medicaid expansion supporters rally at Maine State House - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 999, "identifier": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/20140109_393005.xml-20140108_state_hous4.jpg", "height": 621}, "url": "http://www.pressherald.com/2014/01/08/pro-medicaid_expansion_supporters_descend_on_maine_state_house_/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Passage of a bill that would expand the health coverage faces Republican opposition.", "creator": "@pressherald", "image": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/20140109_393005.xml-20140108_state_hous4.jpg", "title": "Medicaid expansion supporters rally at Maine State House - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "site": "@pressherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=951845858", "fb": {"admins": 769488179, "app_id": 178078215650057}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pressherald", "section": "Health care", "tag": "state", "published_time": "2014-01-08T12:56:10-04:00"}, "google-site-verification": "QWs9pxQP8fwo2-nR5mWopc6qCK2D3920f7bl-U-zkso", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd351c\"", "article_summary": "Beth O\u2019Connor, chairwoman of Maine Taxpayers United, who joined members of that group at the State House Wednesday, said Maine had already seen the effects of Medicaid expansion.\nApproximately 200 people filled the State House Wednesday for a rally supporting the expansion of Medicaid, the publicly funded health insurance program for the poor, elderly and disabled.\nKaiser found that Maine would save $690 million over the next decade from Medicaid expansion.\nPaul LePage and many Republican lawmakers, say Medicaid expansion carries hidden costs and that the state budget already suffers from previous program expansions.\nThat\u2019s because the federal government pays for Medicaid expansion with taxes on residents in all states, regardless of whether a state expands or not."}
