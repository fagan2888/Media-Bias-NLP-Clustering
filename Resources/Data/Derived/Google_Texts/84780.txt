A 26-year-old military police officer from Connecticut is among the first women to complete the Army’s elite Ranger School.

A defense official confirmed Wednesday to The Associated Press that Capt. Kristen Griest, who has served in Afghanistan and graduated from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, is scheduled to graduate Friday from Ranger School at Fort Benning, Georgia. The official was not authorized to disclose the name publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.

Griest of Orange, Connecticut, will graduate alongside 25-year-old 1st Lt. Shaye Haver of Copperas Cove, Texas. Haver’s father confirmed that his daughter, an Apache helicopter pilot and West Point graduate, also finished the Ranger course.

The Griest and Haver families issued a joint statement Wednesday saying the women “are just like all the soldiers in Class 8-15 - happy, relieved, and ready for some good food and sleep.”

One of the first women to complete the Army’s grueling Ranger School is a 25-year-old officer who flies Apache helicopters.

The father of 1st Lt. Shaye Haver of Copperas Cove, Texas, confirmed Wednesday that she is one of two female soldiers scheduled to graduate Friday from Ranger School at Fort Benning, Georgia. The two-month course tests soldiers’ ability to overcome fatigue, hunger and stress during combat operations.

Chris Haver called his daughter’s accomplishment “just amazing” and said, “I’m super proud.”

The Army hasn’t released the women’s names.

The Army allowed them to enroll in the Ranger course as part of a push to open more combat jobs to women. Completing the course allows them to wear the Ranger tab, but it doesn’t let them become members of the Ranger regiment.
