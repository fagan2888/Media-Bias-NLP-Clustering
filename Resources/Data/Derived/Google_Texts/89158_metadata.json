Executives often resort to outside expertise for advice on possible acquisitions, or in an effort to overcome the limits of groupthink about the next strategic move. Imagine a future in which tapping an independent expert involves traipsing down the hall to an office housing a giant display and microphones that stud the ceiling. International Business Machines Corp. has prototyped such a room, where executives can pose their business challenges to Watson, the Jeopardy-winning supercomputer technology. MIT Technology Review\u2019s Tom Simonite writes of an experiment in which researchers, role-playing as executives, first fed Watson data on the imaginary company\u2019s artificial intelligence strategy and then sought advice from Watson on acquisition candidates in that field. But before CEOs start envisioning a Watson room at their company, they should know that the power of technology cuts more than one way. \u201cPeople may feel freer to question their boss\u2019s opinion if Watson is the first to suggest there is another way of looking at a problem,\u201d Mr. Simonite writes.\n\nSashenka Gutierrez/European Pressphoto Agency Robots win!

With Watson angling for the corner office, no job is safe from automation. Are the robots coming to take our jobs? The Pew Research Center recently asked nearly 2,000 technologists what the employment landscape will look like over the next decade, as artificial intelligence and robotics continue to gain ground. The experts, who included CEOs, tech journalists, Internet pioneers and researchers at tech vendors, are divided almost 50-50 on whether AI applications and robots will displace more jobs than they create. Some foresee more income inequality and more blue and white-collar displacement. \u201cThe central question of 2025 will be: What are people for in a world that does not need their labor, and where only a minority are needed to guide the \u2018bot-based economy?\u201d wonders Stow Boyd, lead researcher at GigaOM research. Others are more optimistic, citing humanity\u2019s ability to bounce back. \u201cTechnology will continue to disrupt jobs, but more jobs seem likely to be created,\u201d said Jonathan Grudin, principal researcher for Microsoft Corp. So the short answer is that the jury\u2019s still out on whether we\u2019re heading towards a breakdown in social order or a new era of techno-based entrepreneurship. Someone should ask Watson what it thinks?\n\nWorld will have 34 \u2018super-aged\u2019 nations by 2030. The FT\u2019s Sarah O\u2019Connor reports on a Moody\u2019s study that predicts that the working-age population worldwide will grow half as fast between 2015 and 2030 as during the last 15 years. More than one in five people in 34 countries, including the U.S. and China, will be over 65 in 2030 as well. Some countries, such as Japan and Germany, already have crossed that threshold. Having all these old people tottering around will slow global economic growth by 0.9% between 2020 and 2025, although technological innovation could lessen the impact, Moody\u2019s notes. Bring on the robots. Indeed a number of participants in the previously cited Pew study argue that technology will play a larger role assisting aging populations. \u201cI expect more robotic assistance for the elderly and infirm, because the demands are manageable and the need is increasing,\u201d Microsoft\u2019s Mr. Grudin said.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "A room where executives get help from IBM\u2019s Watson; AI, robotics, and the future of jobs; By 2030, world populations will be much older.", "title": "What Your CEO Is Reading: IBM\u2019s Watson Takes the Corner Office; Robots and Jobs", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/cio/2014/08/08/what-your-ceo-is-reading-ibms-watson-takes-the-corner-office-robots-and-jobs/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-EA546_0808_c_P_20140808131611.jpg"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "CSuite", "article.headline": "What Your CEO Is Reading: IBM\u2019s Watson Takes the Corner Office; Robots and Jobs", "description": "A room where executives get help from IBM\u2019s Watson; AI, robotics, and the future of jobs; By 2030, world populations will be much older.", "article_section": "CSuite", "author": "Tom Loftus", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "testkeys": "C", "article.page": "CIO Journal.
