In today’s edition of The Heartland Institute Daily Podcast, Kenneth Artz, managing editor of Health Care News speaks with Jeff Stier. Stier, a senior fellow at the National Center for Public Policy Research in Washington D.C., heads their risk analysis division. In this podcast, Artz and Stier discuss the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) proposed rule that would extend the agency’s authority over tobacco products to include e-cigarettes.

Under the proposed rule, the FDA would have authority over e-cigarettes despite the fact that the devices have been widely touted as successful smoking cessation products by many scientists and doctors. Stier explains why this is an issue that should concern not only users of e-cigarettes, but all those who advocate free markets.
