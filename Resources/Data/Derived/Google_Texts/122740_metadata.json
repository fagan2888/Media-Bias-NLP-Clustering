The lawsuit is among the multiple complaints that Tea Party groups brought against high-level IRS officials accusing them of subjecting \u201cdissenting groups\u201d applying for tax-exempt status to \u201cunreasonable delays and often harassing, illegal, and discriminatory demands.\u201d\n\nThe plaintiffs, led by NorCal Tea Party Patriots, filed their complaint in May 2013 but are still battling Justice Department tax division lawyers over discovery issues. The government, which disputes the claims and has sought to dismiss the lawsuit, has resisted turning over the \u201cnames and other identifying information\u201d of similar organizations that applied for tax-exempt status. The applicant names, the government argues, are shielded from disclosure by a federal law.\n\nAfter a lower court ordered the IRS to produce the names and other documents, the government intensified its push-back last year by filing a petition for a writ of mandamus with the Sixth Circuit that sought to \u201ccorrect a clear legal error on the part of the trial court\u201d resulting in \u201csignificant and irreversible\u201d harm.\n\nThe Sixth Circuit panel hearing the case wasn\u2019t sympathetic to the IRS\u2019s side, to say the least, venting outrage over its resistance.\n\n\u201c[In this lawsuit the IRS has only compounded the conduct that gave rise to it,\u201d wrote Judge Raymond Kethledge, a President George W. Bush appointee in an opinion joined by Damon Jerome Keith, a senior judge and Carter appointee, and David McKeague, another Bush appointee.\n\n\u201cThe lawyers in the Department of Justice have a long and storied tradition of defending the nation\u2019s interests and enforcing its laws \u2014 all of them, not just selective ones \u2014 in a manner worthy of the Department\u2019s name. The conduct of the IRS\u2019s attorneys in the district court falls outside that tradition,\u201d Judge Kethledge wrote.\n\nThe judge also suggested there was an irony in the IRS arguing that \u201cit would be unduly burdensome\u201d to turn over the documents sought. \u201c[T]his, in a case where the IRS forced the lead plaintiff to produce 3,000 pages of what the Inspector General called \u2018unnecessary information,\u2019\u201d he wrote.\n\nA Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment.\n\nThe discovery issue at hand centered on a post-Watergate statute dealing with the confidentiality and disclosure of tax returns and return information.\n\nA major question was whether the applicant names could be considered \u201creturn information,\u201d a category governed by looser confidentiality rules. The appeals court dug into the language statute in a way reminiscent of the recent Obamacare case that turned on interpreting a six-word phrase in the health law.\n\n\u201c[W]e hold that the names, addresses, and taxpayer-identification numbers of applicants for tax-exempt status are not \u2018return information,\u2019\u201d wrote Judge Kethledge.
