The University of Mississippi Medical Center will move one of its family medicine clinics from a west Jackson site near Central Mississippi Medical Center to an office building near River Oaks Hospital in Flowood.

The university will lease space from Hospital Management Associates, which owns CMMC and River Oaks. The College Board approved leasing of 12,000 square feet from HMA Thursday. UMMC will pay $1.34 million over three years.

University officials say physicians in training must see a certain number of patients to keep the program accredited and that traffic has been falling at the current location.

UMMC has an affiliation agreement with HMA.

Vice Chancellor for Health Affairs Dr. James Keeton says UMMC physicians may begin admitting patients at River Oaks instead of Baptist Medical Center.
