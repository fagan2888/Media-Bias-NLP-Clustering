Updated below | Pity the poor MSNBC graphics guy who is probably on thin ice if not already packing up his desk over this.

During a segment on Thursday's NewsNation about the president's announcement he would grant health insurance companies to have a one year reprieve from canceling "substandard" plans outlawed by ObamaCare, one of the onscreen graphics read (emphasis mine), "Pres.: Failed rollout put burden on Democrats." [see screen capture below page]

The liberal media generally and MSNBC in particular have been careful to message this as a troubled or glitchy rollout -- one MSNBC.com writer called it "flubbed" -- but the harsher F-word, failure, is one they've sought to avoid. What's more, President Obama himself has not used the word "failure" to describe the disastrous rollout of ObamaCare today claimed today his administration failed "to roll out the ACA smoothly."

[UPDATED from earlier to more accurately reflect President Obama's admission of failure. He admitted his administration had failed to ensure a smooth rollout, not that the rollout itself was a complete failure.]
