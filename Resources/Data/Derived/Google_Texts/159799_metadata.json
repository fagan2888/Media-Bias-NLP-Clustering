But CSU\u2019s DeAndre Elliott intercepted a Cody Fajardo pass in the end zone with 46 seconds left to seal the win. Even that got anxious for the Rams, because there was a flag flown on the play \u2013 but the call was offensive pass interference on the Wolf Pack, so CSU survived.\n\n\u201cI thought it was a great call,\u201d CSU coach Jim McElwain said, smiling.\n\nA little earlier on the same drive, an apparent 63-yard touchdown pass from Fajardo to Hasaan Richardson with 3:40 left was waved off because of offensive pass interference, with Richardson pushing off on Elliott before the reception.\n\nSo while CSU might not have been \u201clucky,\u201d it was fortunate to win after leading 17-3 at halftime, and then by 28 late in the third quarter. For one thing, two offensive pass interference calls on the home team in crunch time is, well, a rarity.\n\nMcElwain could have been excused for being more relieved than ecstatic, but he seemed genuinely thrilled with getting out of Reno with the win.\n\n\u201cI just can\u2019t tell you how excited I am about this win,\u201d McElwain said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a great win against a very good football team on the road. Obviously, we had to hang on a little bit, but what it is, is another opportunity for us to teach. . . We won and beat a very good football team, so I\u2019ll take it.\u201d\n\nGoing into the season, the conventional wisdom was that the first half of the CSU schedule in McElwain\u2019s third year was tougher and that if the Rams could get through it with at least three wins, they likely would be headed for their second consecutive bowl game.\n\nThey\u2019ve done better than that, losing only in the second week at Boise State.\n\nThe Rams have put together back-to-back road wins at Boston College of the Atlantic Coast Conference and at Nevada. The Wolf Pack isn\u2019t a powerhouse but is at least tough at home and lost only by seven (35-28) to Arizona in Tucson. And the Wolf Pack the previous week had hung up 46 points against Boise State \u2014 albeit in a 51-46 loss.\n\nWhat did the Rams learn?\n\n\u201cLast time I checked, we\u2019re not the Green Bay Packers or anything,\u201d McElwain said. \u201cWe have to play every down for us to be successful. This will be a great teachable moment for us. . . Here\u2019s what I think we\u2019re starting to learn a little bit: There were some disappointed guys in the locker room \u2013 for a win! Let\u2019s think about that. I kind of had to tell them these are hard to come by. There\u2019s no reason to get down about what happened. Let\u2019s just learn from it and let\u2019s be excited about it.\u201d\n\nCSU, 1-1 in league play with only MW games remaining, plays its next two at Hughes Stadium, against Utah State on Saturday and Wyoming on Oct. 25.\n\nAgainst the Wolf Pack, Grayson was 26-for-36, for 326 yards and the three touchdowns, and the two to Higgins \u2013 covering 42 and 51 yards \u2014 gave the sophomore wide receiver 10 scoring receptions for the season, including six in the last two games. The third TD pass, to Walker, was a one-yarder off play-action to open the scoring.\n\n\u201cObviously, that\u2019s not the way we would have liked to win,\u201d Grayson said. \u201cIt got a little ugly there are the end of the game, but at the end of the day, a conference win is a conference win so we\u2019re happy with where we\u2019re at. We\u2019re 1-1 in conference now and we just have to keep moving forward.\u201d\n\nDee Hart ran for 90 yards on 23 carries for the Rams, and had the fourth touchdown on a 9-yard run with 4:48 left in the third quarter. It was 31-3 at that point, many of the fans in the crowd of 21,847 bailed out, and it seemed all over.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cIt was a good win,\u201d Hart said. \u201cYou always are thankful and blessed you\u2019re on the winning side, but that isn\u2019t how we wanted to win. Coach preached \u2018finish\u2019 and \u2018finish\u2019 and \u2018finish,\u2019 and we didn\u2019t finish tonight. Mainly it was on the part of the offense and we take a lot of blame for it. . . We just didn\u2019t execute and myself, I fumbled (early in the fourth quarter), and we let them back in the game.\u201d\n\nThe Wolf Pack got back in it with Fajardo\u2019s 13-yard TD run with 2:13 left in the third quarter, then his two TD passes \u2013 a 9-yarder to Henderson with 10:31 left and a 11-yarder to Richy Turner with 6:22 remaining. CSU couldn\u2019t move the ball or add points, adding to the pressure \u2013 and it ultimately took Elliott\u2019s interception at the side of the end zone on a third-and-5 from the 10 to clinch it.\n\n\u201cMy emotions were going crazy,\u201d Elliott said. \u201cIt was being in the right place at the right time, I guess.\u201d\n\nThe Rams, of course, declined the offensive pass interference penalty on that play, but it wouldn\u2019t have been shocking to see the call go the other way with contact made in the end zone, given the realities of the contemporary game.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t too surprised,\u201d said Elliott. \u201cIt just meant the refs were doing their job.\u201d\n\nTerry Frei: tfrei@denverpost.com or twitter.com/TFrei\n\nEye on\u2026 The Aggies\n\nUtah State at Colorado State, 5 p.m. Saturday, CBSSN\n\nFor the record: The Aggies are 4-2. Their 34-16 victory over Air Force on Saturday came in their Mountain West opener.\n\nStreaking: Since a 21-14 overtime loss at Arkansas State, Utah State has defeated Brigham Young (35-20) and Air Force.\n\nWho\u2019s hot: Quarterback Darell Garretson, who started seven games last season, again has played well since replacing injured Chuckie Keeton on Sept. 13 in a 36-24 victory over Wake Forest. He is 77-of-116 passing for 1,008 yards and eight touchdowns.\n\nWho\u2019s not: No Aggies running back has cracked 200 yards for the season.\n\nKey stat: Utah State limited CSU quarterback Garrett Grayson to 147 yards passing in a 13-0 victory over the Rams in 2013.\n\nFYI: Yes, NBA fans, the Utah State quarterback is the grandson of the former NBA referee of the same name and the nephew of referee Ron Garretson.\n\nTerry Frei, The Denver Post", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "CSU Rams hang on to beat Nevada 31-24", "title": "CSU Rams hang on to beat Nevada 31-24", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/10/11/csu-rams-hang-on-to-beat-nevada-31-24/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141012__colorado-state-fbp1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141012__colorado-state-fbp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-10-12T00:20:28+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T21:46:28+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Colorado State University"}, "article_summary": "RENO, Nev. \u2014 Although they nearly staged an ugly collapse Saturday night, the Colorado State Rams seem to be for real.\nThe Wolf Pack isn\u2019t a powerhouse but is at least tough at home and lost only by seven (35-28) to Arizona in Tucson.\nAnd the Wolf Pack the previous week had hung up 46 points against Boise State \u2014 albeit in a 51-46 loss.\nKey stat: Utah State limited CSU quarterback Garrett Grayson to 147 yards passing in a 13-0 victory over the Rams in 2013.\nEven that got anxious for the Rams, because there was a flag flown on the play \u2013 but the call was offensive pass interference on the Wolf Pack, so CSU survived."}
