The ads run by Independence USA PAC attacked Cuccinelli on his stance on guns, accusing him of \u201cvoting against closing the gun show loophole,\u201d \u201cendangering our families\u201d and \u201cundermining law enforcement and calling Cuccinelli \u201ctoo extreme for Virginia.\u201d Notably, this ad had little, if any, rotation in downstate Virginia.\n\nBy its own admission, Independence USA PAC spent more than $1 million on ads to support the Democratic candidate \u2013 and eventual winner \u2013 Terry McAuliffe.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThat\u2019s a lot of money and a lot of message. Who was so eager to run ads in this now purple state to defeat Cuccinelli? And would it have mattered to voters if they knew who was behind the ads?\n\nWell, the Supreme Court seems to think so. In the controversial Citizens United decision, that allowed corporations and unions to spend unlimited amounts in election campaigns, the Court also upheld the disclosure requirements in current law by an 8-to-1 margin. Justice Kennedy said from the bench:\n\n\u201cWe reject Citizens United's challenge to the disclaimer and disclosure provisions. Those mechanisms provide information to the electorate. The resulting transparency enables the electorate to make informed decisions and give proper weight to different speakers and different messages.\"\n\nSo who was behind Independence USA PAC? Who was the true source of the $1 million spent to influence a Virginia election?\n\nIt turns out it was outgoing New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg. How would Virginians have perceived the ad if at the end there was a visual showing Bloomberg among the top funders of Independence USA PAC. It\u2019s fair to ask how Bloomberg would have played in Virginia. And it\u2019s a safe bet Cuccinelli\u2019s side would have tried to capitalize on Bloomberg\u2019s support for McAuliffe.\n\nWould they have felt that a northerner \u2013 a New Yorker, at that \u2013 should not have been interfering in Virginia\u2019s election? Would they hear the ad\u2019s message differently? Or would they not have cared and focused only on the substance of the accusations?\n\nThere\u2019s no way to tell now. What we do know is that these kinds of ads from outside groups are growing. In the 2012 elections, these groups spent about $1 billion, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, most of it on TV ads in races all across the country. More ads from outside groups mean more murky money pouring into the election process.\n\nHow could Independence USA PAC get away with keeping viewers in the dark about who was paying for ads? The answer is simple. Because the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) turned a blind eye and let them run those ads with a tagline that meant nothing to most viewers despite laws already on the books to the contrary. Section 317 of the Communications Act requires that political ads must \u201cfully and fairly disclose the true identity of the person or persons, or corporation, committee, association or other unincorporated group, or other entity\u201d paying for the ad. In explaining the provision when it was enacted the Commission wrote, \u201cListeners are entitled to know by whom they are being persuaded.\u201d\n\nBut in practice, it\u2019s not happening. Instead, we get ads with tag lines like the one in the Cuccinelli ad \u2013 \u201cPaid for by Independence USA PAC.\u201d\n\nGiven the Supreme Court\u2019s overwhelming support of disclosure and strong existing statutory language, the new FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler could move quickly to adopt new, updated rules requiring more up-to-date and accurate on-air sponsorship identification of the funders of political ads on television. But whether he is willing to do so remains unclear.\n\nTo remove the hold of his nomination, he gave reassurances to Texas Sen. Ted Cruz Ted CruzEven in defeat, Trump could harm the country irreparably Sanders steps up his attacks in homestretch 5 takeaways from the rush for campaign cash MORE (R) regarding FCC action on disclosure. Sen. Cruz characterized the assurances this way: \u201cMr. Wheeler stated that he had heard the unambiguous message that trying to impose the requirements of the Disclose Act, absent congressional action, would imperil the Commission\u2019s vital statutory responsibilities, and he explicitly stated that doing so was `not a priority.\u2019\u201d\n\nWhat should be a priority is ensuring the American people have the information they need to make up their own minds. Chairman Wheeler should not be cowed by congressional bullying to fail to enforce existing laws and regulations. As the Supreme Court has said, voters have a right know the \u201ctrue identity\u201d of who is paying for the political ads flooding into our homes in the post-Citizens United election system.\n\nMcGehee is policy director of the Campaign Legal Center and heads McGehee Strategies, a public interest consulting business.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.title": "FCC has obligation to disclose political ad sources", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Congress Blog"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "title": "FCC has obligation to disclose political ad sources", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/politics/193289-fcc-has-obligation-to-disclose-political-ad-sources", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-02T23:19:58-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-02T23:19-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/politics/193289-fcc-has-obligation-to-disclose-political-ad-sources", "dcterms.date": "2013-12-17T13:00-05:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Joe Picard", "author": "Meredith McGehee", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",Ted Cruz,", "article": {"published_time": "2013-12-17T13:00:00-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-02T23:19:58-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/politics/193289-fcc-has-obligation-to-disclose-political-ad-sources", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "card": "summary", "title": "FCC has obligation to disclose political ad sources"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd489d\"", "article_summary": "How could Independence USA PAC get away with keeping viewers in the dark about who was paying for ads?\nHow would Virginians have perceived the ad if at the end there was a visual showing Bloomberg among the top funders of Independence USA PAC.\nSo who was behind Independence USA PAC?\nBy its own admission, Independence USA PAC spent more than $1 million on ads to support the Democratic candidate \u2013 and eventual winner \u2013 Terry McAuliffe.\nWho was the true source of the $1 million spent to influence a Virginia election?"}
