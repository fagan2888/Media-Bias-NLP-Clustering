But a new study about the demographics of those who work from home paints a much different picture.\n\nThe vast majority of those who work remotely are actually men \u2013 and there are no significant differences between remote workers with or without kids or among various age groups, according to the report, It\u2019s 10 a.m.: Do You Know Where and How your Employees Are Working? by employer consulting firm the Flex+Strategy Group. The study found that 36 percent of men do most of their work remotely, versus just 23 percent of women.\n\nExperts say another reason for the gap may be the myth that women take advantage of telecommuting policies in order to watch their children or accomplish non-work related tasks. Women may be so worried about being placed on the \u201cmommy track\u201d that they avoid asking for anything that could be perceived as special treatment. \u201cPerhaps women are more concerned about how they would be perceived if they worked remotely,\u201d says Cali Williams Yost, CEO and founder of Flex+Strategy Group.\n\nSuch concerns might be well-placed. Managers are more likely to grant flextime to high-status men seeking flexible schedules in order to advance their careers, according to a 2012 study in the Journal of Social Issues. Requests by women were unlikely to be granted, regardless of their job status or reason.\n\nRelated: Marissa Mayer\u2019s Morale-Crushing Mistake\n\nEven so, women shouldn\u2019t disqualify themselves from flexible arrangements without at least discussing it with their employers, says Pat Katepoo, founder of WorkOptions.com, which helps employees negotiate for a better work-life balance. \u201cIf you want it, you have to ask for it,\u201d she adds. \u201cDon\u2019t let the stereotypes or the stigma stop you.\u201d\n\nAnother reason for the disparity in how many men and women telecommute could be the type of work each gender does. The early adopters of telecommuting were in female-dominated job categories such as clerical work or medical transcription services. As technology has advanced, with more male-dominated industries such as information technology and software development, the numbers have shifted.\n\nHome-based work (including self-employed workers) in computer engineering and science occupations increased by 69 percent between 2000 and 2010, according to an October Census report. About a quarter of home-based workers were in management, business, and financial occupations.\n\n\u201cStereotypes from the early days of telecommuting are really just hanging on,\u201d says Pamela La Gioia, president of Telework Recruiting. \u201cThat may be one reason companies are still reluctant to put telecommuting plans into place.\u201d\n\nSome companies may still believe that telecommuting is a perk that entices just a small cohort of workers, but a growing number of firms are starting to realize the broader appeal of such strategies. Sure, millennials like the freedom of choosing their own hours and work locations, but such arrangements can also benefit \u201csandwich generation\u201d workers taking care of elderly parents as well as their children, and pre-retirees who want to scale back their work life without entirely abandoning their professional identity.\n\nRelated: Why We\u2019re Still Worked Up About Working from Home\n\nTurns out, telecommuters often end up putting in more hours than their in-office counterparts. More than half of remote workers spend more than 40 hours per week on the job, according to a 2012 study by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Experts say it\u2019s easy for people who work from home to blur the line between work and personal life. It\u2019s also easy to get distracted, overlooked, or passed over for a promotion if both employees and managers don\u2019t have a clear strategy for making work-from-home arrangements function properly.\n\nIn addition to helping attract and retain workers, telecommuting \u2013 on a full-time, part-time, or as-needed basis \u2013 has also become a key tool in companies\u2019 business continuity plans. During the recent winter storms throughout the Midwest and the East Coast, many companies relied on telecommuters to keep operations on track.\n\nIn 2012, nearly two-thirds of employers allowed their workers to log at least some of their regularly scheduled hours at home, up from just 34 percent in 2005, according to a report by the Society of Human Resource Manager and the Families and Work Institute.\n\n\u201cTelecommuting is starting to come of age,\u201d says Lisa Horn, a senior advisor with SHRM, based in Alexandria, Va. \u201cIt\u2019s becoming more widely used and accepted as an overall business strategy for organizations.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "For many, the stereotypical telecommuter is either a millennial slaving away at a laptop in a coffee shop or a frazzled mom taking conference calls from her kitchen with a baby on her lap.
