Koskinen added that the agency hasn't fully funded customer service for the last \"three or four years,\" and that about $900 million had been pulled from cybersecurity.\n\nThe agency has been hit with at least two successful cyberattacks in the past year. A cyberattack last year resulted in the theft of data on 330,000 taxpayers from the agency's \"Get Transcript\" database, while an attack last week resulted in the loss of special personal identification numbers associated with 101,000.\n\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Donald Trump outsources campaign operations to RNC Some Republicans fear the RNC will be too consumed with Trump to focus on House, Senate and governors races.\n\nRelated Story: http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/article/2582979", "article_metadata": {"description": "Both cybersecurity and customer service at the Internal Revenue Service have suffered because of Obamacare, the agency's head said in remarks to Congress on Thursday.\nCongress, as I noted in my testimony, has underfunded \u2026 the Affordable Care Act, IRS Commissioner John Koskinen told a panel of the House Appropriations Committee.
