But in \u201cConserving Energy For Dummies Teachers,\u201d four Palo Alto High School students from Margo Wixsom\u2019s beginning photography class seized the opportunity to turn that relationship on its head.\n\nDaniella and Elena, freshmen, and Nikhil and Ronak, sophomores, teamed up to explore energy conservation through artistic avenues. They collaborated with one another to write a script, act out scenes and produce an entertaining \u2014 yet educational \u2014 video.\n\nAfter consulting Rebecca Navarro, Palo Alto Unified School District\u2019s energy specialist, the group incorporated several energy savings statistics. Then they figured out compelling ways to convey those facts.\n\n\u201cYou see with videos they show you in science class like \u2018Bill Nye The Science Guy,\u2019 the reason why everyone loves him is because he\u2019s so quirky and it\u2019s funny to watch,\u201d Nikhil said.\n\nFrom catching a teacher eating his lunch in front of an open refrigerator to probing a coach who forgot to cover the swimming pool, the group devised humorous situations to deliver important messages about sustainability.\n\nTeachers star in the video, but fellow students are the target audience.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s a good thing we\u2019re doing because kids won\u2019t listen otherwise,\u201d Daniella said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a matter of turning off the faucet, turning off the lights, and it\u2019s just such a quick thing to do.\u201d\n\nThe group put a lot of time and energy into the project, often meeting during lunch and before and after school. Wixsom has encouraged the group to enter the video in the 2015 Greenlight Film and Fashion Festival as well as next year\u2019s California Student Media Festival.\n\nWixsom has integrated water and energy conservation into the curriculum of her art classes since coming to California in 1998.\n\n\u201cEnvironmental education is an essential part of core information that students need to be well-informed and critical-thinking adults,\u201d Wixsom said. \u201cPhotography and art are such solid connections for this type of exploration.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Ben Custer,Benjamin Custer,energy,energy conservation,Environment,group project,Palo Alto,Palo Alto High School,Paly,Photography,video,Education,Politics & Gov,Science & Tech,Frontpage Featured,Multimedia", "description": "From catching a teacher eating in front of an open refrigerator to probing a coach who forgot to cover the swimming pool, photography students use humorous\u2026", "generator": "WordPress 3.5", "robots": "noodp,noydir"}, "article_summary": "\u201cEnvironmental education is an essential part of core information that students need to be well-informed and critical-thinking adults,\u201d Wixsom said.\nAfter consulting Rebecca Navarro, Palo Alto Unified School District\u2019s energy specialist, the group incorporated several energy savings statistics.\nBut in \u201cConserving Energy For Dummies Teachers,\u201d four Palo Alto High School students from Margo Wixsom\u2019s beginning photography class seized the opportunity to turn that relationship on its head.\nThey collaborated with one another to write a script, act out scenes and produce an entertaining \u2014 yet educational \u2014 video.\nDaniella and Elena, freshmen, and Nikhil and Ronak, sophomores, teamed up to explore energy conservation through artistic avenues."}
