Panko is a retired teacher, he refers to himself a liberal, he\u2019s a big fan of unions and he\u2019s a long-time Democrat.\n\nWith Election Day a week away we\u2019re profiling some Idaho voters. We talked with Panko about the experience of being a hardcore Democrat in Idaho.\n\nPanko says the affiliation came in handy nearly three decades ago when he first asked out the woman who would become his wife. She had some requirements for him.\n\n\u201c[She said] \u2018I hope you\u2019re both a Methodist and a Democrat,\u2019\u201d he recalls.\n\nClick play to hear the radio version of this story.\n\nPanko brags about always making it out on voting day.\n\n\u201cI hate to say it\u2019s habit, but if it is habit it\u2019s a good habit,\u201d he says. \u201cI look forward to watching NCAA football and the election returns. They\u2019re my two favorites.\u201d\n\nPanko punctuates that statement with a long laugh. He laughs a lot. But when he\u2019s watching those election night results he\u2019s usually not laughing. That\u2019s because as a Democrat in Idaho, the people he likes usually lose. That\u2019s why he doesn\u2019t get his hopes up.\n\n\u201cRealistically, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever thought a Democrat on a statewide level would have a chance,\u201d he says. \u201cEver since John Evans left office.\u201d\n\nEvans was Idaho's governor and left office 27 years ago. There have been Idaho Democrats elected to high offices since, but not many. And none have won a statewide race in more than a decade.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had some good candidates but [most of them] haven\u2019t even come close,\u201d Panko says.\n\nThis year, Panko thinks the Democrat who will come the closest is Holli Woodings. She\u2019s running for Secretary of State against Lawerence Denney.\n\n\u201cShe just wiped him clean in the debates,\u201d Panko says. \u201cOf course nobody watches the debates to speak of. People who watch those political debates probably know who they\u2019re going to vote for anyway.\u201d\n\nPanko says it\u2019s hard to be an Idaho Democrat, unless you live where he does, northeast Boise. The neighborhood known as the North End is one of the most solidly Democratic strongholds in this very Republican state.\n\n\u201cWhen I go down to the voting booth - and I like to vote in person not by mail - I don\u2019t have a lot of influence on the vote,\u201d he says. \u201cI do in the North End. You know, if you\u2019re a Republican in the North End you can probably say the same thing, why even put up the effort to put a candidate out because the Democrat is going to beat him every time. Republicans in the North End should know how I feel statewide.\u201d\n\nBut even though Panko gets to send who he wants to the state legislature, he thinks when they get there, they won\u2019t be able to accomplish much. That\u2019s because Republicans outnumber Democrats in the legislature about four to one.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s frustrating,\" he says. \"But they\u2019re good people and I think they probably know that up front.\"\n\nHe thinks some of his state legislators over the years quit running for reelection because they came to feel they couldn't do much good from the Capitol.\n\nPanko says Idaho Democrats have adopted a strategy in many races of picking candidates who are almost indistinguishable from moderate Republicans. It hasn\u2019t worked so far, but Panko says he\u2019ll wait and see. He points to his A.J. Balukoff yard sign. Balukoff is running for governor as a Democrat against incumbent Gov. C.L. \"Butch\" Otter.\n\n\u201cA.J.\u2019s probably about as close to a Republican as the Democrats could ever field,\u201d Panko says. \u201cI actually have a certain amount of hope for A.J. except that only one time has he shared his internal polling. So I think if it were really looking good he\u2019d let us, those of us who paid a little bit of money, know how the internal polling was going.\u201d\n\nThis elicits another long, hearty laugh. Panko is frank about the experience of being an Idaho Democrat. He jokes about it but he\u2019s often frustrated and frequently disappointed. However, he says, he never despairs.\n\n\u201cA lot of things have happened in my lifetime that have only been the result of long-term effort,\u201d he says. \u201cI never thought I\u2019d live to see the day when Apartheid ended in South Africa. I thought maybe the Berlin Wall might come down but I didn\u2019t think it would happen as soon as it did. The pendulum swings. It\u2019s just got an extra-long swing in Idaho. And it will swing back some time.\u201d\n\nPanko says he plans to keep voting even when he\u2019s pretty sure he\u2019s backing the losing side.\n\nFind Adam Cotterell on Twitter @cotterelladam\n\nCopyright 2014 Boise State Public Radio", "article_metadata": {"category": "Politics & Goverment", "description": "Jerry Panko vacuums up leaves around the candidate signs in his north Boise front yard.
