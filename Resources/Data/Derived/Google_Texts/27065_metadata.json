And by the way, their ratings are through the roof. If they weren\u2019t, they wouldn\u2019t cover me, I\u2019ll be honest. It\u2019s a very simple formula in entertainment, in television. If you get good ratings. If you get good ratings, and these aren\u2019t good, they are monstrous then you are going to be on all of the time, even if you have nothing to say.\u201d\n\nTrump is saying nothing in his speeches, except the word great and a promise that America will also be great if he is elected president. Donald Trump is gaming the media. He gets in front of the microphone and babbles on about nothing. For example, Trump announced his plan to repeal and replace Obamacare with \u201csomething great.\u201d In case we missed all of the details that Trump was dropping, he repeated that he was going to replace access to affordable healthcare with something great.\n\nThe media knows that they are being conned, but they continue to cover Donald Trump\u2019s every move because they are have convinced themselves that Trump equals ratings.\n\nThe media created Donald Trump\u2019s surge in the polls by giving him daily free media coverage. If the media stopped covering Trump tomorrow, he would plummet in the polls. While Trump\u2019s endless media coverage about nothing is annoying, he is doing Democrats a huge favor by taking away potential media coverage from more serious candidates.\n\nEach cable news network knows that Donald Trump\u2019s speeches are not newsworthy, but they continue to give every one of them live coverage. Trump has no policy solutions. Trump is offering no answers. His campaign is based on the idea that America is bad right now, but he can make it great.\n\nTrump admits that he is saying nothing, but the networks are still flocking to cover him. Because in America\u2019s controlled corporate media, ratings are more important than informing the public.", "article_metadata": {"description": "During his rally in Dallas, TX tonight, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump admitted that his speeches are about nothing.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Jason Easley", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "During his rally in Dallas, TX tonight, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump admitted that his speeches are about nothing.", "title": "Clown Exposed As Donald Trump Admits That His Campaign Speeches Are About Nothing", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2015/09/14/clown-exposed-donald-trump-admits-campaign-speeches.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/trump-dallas-rally.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-09-14T21:50:05+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "Editors' Picks,Featured News,Issues,dallas texas rally for trump,Donald Trump,trump dallas texas speech,trump speech about nothing,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,barack obama,hillary clinton,bernie sanders,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "Issues", "published_time": "2015-09-14T21:50:05+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-14T21:50:05+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "dallas texas rally for trump, Donald Trump, trump dallas texas speech, trump speech about nothing"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb539\"", "article_summary": "During his rally in Dallas, TX tonight, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump admitted that his speeches are about nothing.\nEach cable news network knows that Donald Trump\u2019s speeches are not newsworthy, but they continue to give every one of them live coverage.\nThe media created Donald Trump\u2019s surge in the polls by giving him daily free media coverage.\nWhile Trump\u2019s endless media coverage about nothing is annoying, he is doing Democrats a huge favor by taking away potential media coverage from more serious candidates.\nDonald Trump is gaming the media."}
