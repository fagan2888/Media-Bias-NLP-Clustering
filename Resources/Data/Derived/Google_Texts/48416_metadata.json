When police officers arrived at the scene, the controller, Philip Maschek, was squatting in front of a small refrigerator, swaying back and forth as he drank from a water bottle.\n\nThis led to Maschek\u2019s arrest for public intoxication. However, Maschek claimed that he was not intoxicated and refused to take a sobriety test despite his state.\n\nMaschek, clearly intoxicated, was \u201cslurring his speech, swaying on his feet, struggling to follow directions and balancing,\" according to the report. Police were worried Maschek was too intoxicated to climb down a steep ladder to leave the tower and didn't immediately handcuff him, according to a report.\n\nIn all of the 20 years that Mascheck has worked with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), he has never been addressed as problematic, this being the first major problem he's caused for the FAA.\n\nThis being said, with the tower operating room that Mascheck was occupying being defined as \u201chighly sensitive\u201d and a \u201csafety-oriented position,\u201d how was it that this was able to happen?\n\nLike any job, air traffic control specialists require an extensive amount of training, including passing a medical examination and security investigation.\n\nThe FAA is currently investigating what happened further and Mascheck has officially resigned from his position as air controller and will not be returning to work.", "article_metadata": {"description": "When authorities found 50-year-old air marshal controller Philip Maschek from Arkansas passed out in his chair with his shirt off at 7:45 a.m. Thursday morning, it was a clear telltale that this man was not cut out to be controlling any air traffic..05/26/2016 6:08:14AM EST.", "author": "Brooke Carlucci", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "When authorities found 50-year-old air marshal controller Philip Maschek from Arkansas passed out in his chair with his shirt off at 7:45 a.m. Thursday morning, it was a clear telltale that this man was not cut out to be controlling any air traffic.", "title": "Brooke Carlucci - Air Traffic Controller Arrested After Being Accused of Drinking on the Job", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/brookecarlucci/2015/07/21/air-traffic-controller-arrested-after-being-accused-of-drinking-on-the-job-n2028453", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/181/bbd39b13-6f78-4981-a1fd-8d4be100c08f.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "When authorities found 50-year-old air marshal controller Philip Maschek from Arkansas passed out in his chair with his shirt off at 7:45 a.m. Thursday morning, it was a clear telltale that this man was not cut out to be controlling any air traffic.", "title": "Brooke Carlucci - Air Traffic Controller Arrested After Being Accused of Drinking on the Job", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/brookecarlucci/2015/07/21/air-traffic-controller-arrested-after-being-accused-of-drinking-on-the-job-n2028453", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/181/bbd39b13-6f78-4981-a1fd-8d4be100c08f.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Air Traffic Controller Arrested After Being Accused of Drinking on the Job, Brooke Carlucci, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd343\"", "article_summary": "When authorities found 50-year-old air marshal controller Philip Maschek from Arkansas \u201cpassed out in his chair with his shirt off\u201d at 7:45 a.m. Thursday morning, it was clear that this man was not cut out to be controlling any air traffic.\nThe FAA is currently investigating what happened further and Mascheck has officially resigned from his position as air controller and will not be returning to work.\nLike any job, air traffic control specialists require an extensive amount of training, including passing a medical examination and security investigation.\nWhen police officers arrived at the scene, the controller, Philip Maschek, was squatting in front of a small refrigerator, swaying back and forth as he drank from a water bottle.\nMaschek, clearly intoxicated, was \u201cslurring his speech, swaying on his feet, struggling to follow directions and balancing,\" according to the report."}
