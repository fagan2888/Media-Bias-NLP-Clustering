Harris also played 15.6 percent of the special-teams snaps.\n\nBlock party. Brandon Marshall was honored Saturday at the 38th Ed Block Courage Awards. Marshall and fellow inside linebacker Danny Trevathan were named the Broncos\u2019 co-recipients of the 2015 award for their \u201ccommitment to sportsmanship and courage.\u201d\n\nMarshall and Trevathan returned last season from injuries that required surgery. Trevathan, who had his left knee reconstructed in January 2015, led the Denver defense with 110 tackles in the regular season and tied a Super Bowl record with two fumble recoveries. Trevathan signed a four-year contract with the Bears last week.\n\nMarshall, who played with two screws in his foot (one and a half have since been removed), finished second on the Denver defense with 101 tackles.\n\nUnrein back with Bears. Former Broncos defensive tackle Mitch Unrein signed a two-year contract to return to the Bears.\n\nUnrein, an Eaton native, played four seasons with the Broncos (2011-14) after joining their practice squad in 2010.\n\nHe signed with the Bears last September after he was waived by the Chargers.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Free agent tackle Ryan Harris to visit with Steelers", "title": "Free agent tackle Ryan Harris to visit with Steelers", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/03/13/free-agent-tackle-ryan-harris-to-visit-with-steelers/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160313__Ryan-Harrisp1.jpg", "height": 448}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160313__Ryan-Harrisp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-03-13T19:34:48+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-14T22:08:01+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3304\"", "article_summary": "Evan Mathis, another guard, is on the open market with tackle Ryan Harris.\nHarris signed a one-year contract with the Broncos last May after tackle Ryan Clady was placed on injured reserve because of a knee injury.\nHarris, who returned to the Broncos last year and switched from right to left tackle because of injuries, will visit with the Pittsburgh Steelers on Thursday.\nFormer Broncos defensive tackle Mitch Unrein signed a two-year contract to return to the Bears.\nTrevathan signed a four-year contract with the Bears last week."}
