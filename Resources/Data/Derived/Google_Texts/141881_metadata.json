Here\u2019s a sneak peek at our new collaboration. Leave your feedback in the comments below.\n\nEight years ago, the country was in financial free fall. Now, with the 2016 presidential election looming, America\u2019s economic landscape is much different: unemployment is below five percent; job growth is rising; and corporate profits and housing prices are booming.\n\nBut not far below the surface is a much less glowing economic reality: an America where wages are stagnant, and more work is temporary and part-time. If you\u2019ve been unemployed for a long time, you\u2019re likely to stay that way \u2014 and the gap between the rich and everyone else is wider than ever.\n\nWe at APM\u2019s Marketplace, FRONTLINE and PBS NewsHour are joining forces to investigate why.\n\nPOLL: What\u2019s your economic anxiety number?\n\nIn the run-up to the November elections and continuing through the presidential inauguration in January 2017, we\u2019ll bring you \u201cHow the Deck Is Stacked\u201d \u2014 a series of collaborative, multiplatform reports with Marketplace\u2019s Kai Ryssdal investigating this new American economy, the forces that are shaping it, and the lives of the people living in it.\n\nStarting today, our collaboration \u2014 jointly funded by PBS and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) \u2014 will produce stories that will be broadcast on PBS NewsHour, published on FRONTLINE\u2019s website, aired on Marketplace and distributed across each organization\u2019s social media platforms.\n\nThese stories will explore different facets of the individual economic unease that persists across the country, despite booming big-picture indicators. We\u2019ll bring our unique strengths to telling these stories together across radio, digital, and broadcast platforms in the coming months. You\u2019ll hear from both the decision makers and institutions that led us here and the citizens who are struggling to get ahead in this new reality of the American economy. You\u2019ll come away with fresh insights about \u201cHow the Deck Is Stacked.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE: Results of the Marketplace Economic Anxiety Index\n\nWe\u2019re excited to launch this new series today, with a look at Americans\u2019 economic anxiety, drawn from Marketplace\u2019s companion radio series \u201cMy Economy\u201d and the original polling it conducts with Edison Research.\n\nHear more from Kai today on both APM\u2019s Marketplace and on tonight\u2019s PBS NewsHour (check local listings) in an interview with him and PBS NewsHour co-anchor and managing editor Judy Woodruff.\n\nWe hope you\u2019ll join the conversation on Twitter using the hashtag #TheDeck.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In the run-up to the November elections and continuing through the presidential inauguration in January 2017, we at APM\u2019s Marketplace, FRONTLINE and PBS NewsHour bring you \u201cHow the Deck Is Stacked\u201d -- a series of collaborative, multiplatform reports investigating this new American economy, the forces that are shaping it, and the lives of the people living in it.", "pubdate": 20160314, "og": {"site_name": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "In the run-up to the November elections and continuing through the presidential inauguration in January 2017, we at APM\u2019s Marketplace, FRONTLINE and PBS NewsHour bring you \u201cHow the Deck Is Stacked\u201d -- a series of collaborative, multiplatform reports investigating this new American economy, the forces that are shaping it, and the lives of the people living in it.", "title": "Introducing 'How the Deck Is Stacked'", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/GettyImages-500799129.jpg", "url": "http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/introducing-how-the-deck-is-stacked/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "In the run-up to the November elections and continuing through the presidential inauguration in January 2017, we at APM\u2019s Marketplace, FRONTLINE and PBS NewsHour bring you \u201cHow the Deck Is Stacked\u201d -- a series of collaborative, multiplatform reports investigating this new American economy, the forces that are shaping it, and the lives of the people living in it.", "title": "Introducing 'How the Deck Is Stacked'", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/GettyImages-500799129.jpg", "creator": "@newshour", "site": "@newshour", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "fb": {"app_id": 114150878604116}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/newshour", "tag": "Vote 2016"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "APM's Marketplace, frontline, how the deck is stacked, Vote 2016"}, "article_summary": "FRONTLINE, APM\u2019s Marketplace and PBS NewsHour are joining forces to investigate the American economy.\nWe at APM\u2019s Marketplace, FRONTLINE and PBS NewsHour are joining forces to investigate why.\nHear more from Kai today on both APM\u2019s Marketplace and on tonight\u2019s PBS NewsHour (check local listings) in an interview with him and PBS NewsHour co-anchor and managing editor Judy Woodruff.\nThese stories will explore different facets of the individual economic unease that persists across the country, despite booming big-picture indicators.\nWe\u2019ll bring our unique strengths to telling these stories together across radio, digital, and broadcast platforms in the coming months."}
