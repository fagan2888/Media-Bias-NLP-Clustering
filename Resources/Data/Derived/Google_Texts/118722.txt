Apparently the United States can fight a world war in less time than it can put together a successful website.

In an email to Fox News’ Bret Baier, a man identified as Bill from Kentucky certainly took less than three years to put the entire Obamacare fiasco into perspective. Bill compared the time it took to launch healthcare.gov to the United States’ entire involvement in World War II.

“Putting things in perspective: March 21st 2010 to October 1 2013 is 3 years, 6 months, 10 days. December 7, 1941 to May 8, 1945 is 3 years, 5 months, 1 day. What this means is that in the time we were attacked at Pearl Harbor to the day Germany surrendered is not enough time for this progressive federal government to build a working webpage. Mobilization of millions, building tens of thousands of tanks, planes, jeeps, subs, cruisers, destroyers, torpedoes, millions upon millions of guns, bombs, ammo, etc. Turning the tide in North Africa, Invading Italy, D-Day, Battle of the Bulge, Race to Berlin – all while we were also fighting the Japanese in the Pacific!! And in that amount of time – this administration can’t build a working webpage.”

Baier read the email on his show “Special Report” on Friday night, eliciting an astounding outcry from viewers demanding to see Bill’s email online. Their voices were heard as Baier posted the entirety of the email to his blog.

Despite the healthcare exchange site’s snafus of late, the Obama administration has promised a working site by the end of November. The administration reportedly has hired a private firm to handle working out the site’s kinks since President Obama admittedly can’t write code.
