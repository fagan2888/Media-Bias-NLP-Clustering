(Mark Gormus/Richmond Times-Dispatch via AP)\n\nThe worry these days on the eight-member Supreme Court is finding five votes on a controversial issue. But so far the justices have been unanimous in staying out of the political upheaval that has engulfed their court.\n\nAnd they received a stern warning last week from Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) to keep it that way.\n\nIt seems beyond question that Judge Merrick Garland is respected by the justices and a friend to many; the next step for the bright young lawyers who clerk for him at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit is often a coveted move down the street to a spot in someone\u2019s chambers at the marble palace at 1 First St. NE.\n\n[Merrick Garland\u2019s instinct for the middle could put hin in influential spot]\n\nAnd there is little debate that, as Justice Elena Kagan noted last week, there\u2019s a reason that courts work better with an odd number of judges. Stalemates and tie votes already have become an issue in the wake of Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s death in February.\n\nBut so far, at least, no justice has been willing to publicly comment on Garland\u2019s qualifications for moving from the second most important court in the land to the first, nor to render an opinion about the Republican Senate\u2019s refusal to consider President Obama\u2019s nominee in this election year.\n\nBefore Justice Sonia Sotomayor spoke and answered questions at St. John\u2019s College in Santa Fe, N.M., last week, for instance, audience members were told not to ask about either Garland or the nomination process.\n\nKagan also refused to talk about her old friend at an appearance at New York University Law School. As dean of Harvard Law School, their shared alma mater, Kagan had lauded Garland and ribbed him about making it to the bench before she did.\n\n[Merrick Garland\u2019s record of respectful disagreements]\n\nShe had the last laugh, of course, but has demonstrated her regard for Garland by hiring eight of his former clerks since she joined the Supreme Court in 2010.\n\nJustice Stephen G. Breyer has shooed away questions about the nomination process in appearances since Scalia\u2019s death, and Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. told students at Georgetown Law School that the court has had an even number of justices before and \u201cwe will deal with it.\u201d\n\nIt is the justices\u2019 natural inclination to try to stay out of the political fray, of course. But it is not unheard of for them to venture an opinion about a nominee. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, for instance, came to Sotomayor\u2019s defense before she was confirmed in 2009.\n\nBut University of Chicago law professor David A. Strauss, who interviewed Obama last week as Obama made the case for Garland, said the silence from the justices is not surprising.\n\n\u201cI think their inclination would be to avoid doing anything that takes sides in this political fight,\u201d Strauss said.\n\nThat made the unusual preemptive warning from Grassley even more surprising.\n\nHe was reacting to remarks that Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. made before Scalia\u2019s death about the nomination process.\n\n[Political wars damage Supreme Court\u2019s reputation, Roberts says]\n\nRoberts lamented the public\u2019s growing perception of the court as a political body, and the chief justice said the blame started with the Senate confirmation process.\n\n\u201cWhen you have a sharply political, divisive hearing process, it increases the danger that whoever comes out of it will be viewed in those terms,\u201d Roberts said in a speech to law students just before Scalia\u2019s death.\n\n\u201cIf the Democrats and Republicans have been fighting so furiously about whether you\u2019re going to be confirmed, it\u2019s natural for some member of the public to think, well, you must be identified in a particular way as a result of that process,\u201d he said.\n\nRoberts noted that the last three nominees \u2014 Alito, Sotomayor and Kagan, all of whom he called highly qualified \u2014 were confirmed on largely party-line votes.\n\n\u201cThat suggests to me that the process is being used for something other than ensuring the qualifications of the nominees,\u201d said the 61-year-old chief justice.\n\nRoberts has been silent since Scalia\u2019s death and Garland\u2019s nomination, and in his speech on the Senate floor last week, Grassley warned the chief justice should keep quiet on the subject.\n\nGrassley, 82, and running for what would be his seventh term in the Senate, noted a New York Times column in which a law professor said it would be an important move for Roberts, nominated by President George W. Bush, to call for the Republican Senate to make the court whole.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a political temptation the chief justice should resist,\u201d Grassley said.\n\nIn his criticism, Grassley said, Roberts \u201chas it exactly backwards.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe confirmation process doesn\u2019t make the justices appear political,\u201d Grassley said. \u201cThe confirmation process has gotten political precisely because the court has drifted from the constitutional text and rendered decisions based instead on policy preferences.\u201d\n\nOh and by the way, Grassley said: \u201cMany of my constituents believe, with all due respect, that the chief justice is part of the problem.\u201d\n\n[Obamacare threatens John Roberts\u2019 dream of a nonpartisan court]\n\nGrassley didn\u2019t mention which of Roberts\u2019s votes \u201creflected political considerations, not legal ones,\u201d but apparently he is among the conservatives who feel let down by the chief justice\u2019s votes on the Affordable Care Act.\n\nObama was partly to blame, too, Grassley said. \u201cNot surprisingly, [the court\u2019s] approval rating has dropped most drastically in recent years following the president\u2019s appointment of Justices Sotomayor and Kagan,\u201d he said.\n\nThe confirmation of Sotomayor and Kagan to replace Republican appointees David Souter and John Paul Stevens, respectively, have not changed the balance of power on the court that would accompany Garland\u2019s ascension to Scalia\u2019s seat.\n\nIt would make a court where Democratic presidents have installed five liberals, while Republican presidents have named the four who are most conservative.\n\nBut the next president is likely to make a mark on the court as well, and Obama warned Republicans to think of the future if they recapture the White House.\n\n\u201cSo now the Democrats say, well what\u2019s good for the goose is good for the gander,\" Obama said, adding, \u201cIf different parties control the White House and the Senate during that period of time, you\u2019re not going to get any appointments done \u2014 which is a disaster for the courts, generally.\u201d\n\nObama, of course, is an imperfect messenger. As a senator, he voted against Roberts, who he said was qualified for the court but lacked empathy for the little guy. And he was part of an effort to deny a vote on Alito.\n\nHe says now that he regrets that decision.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Grassley warns Roberts and the justices to stay out of political fight.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/robert.barnes.3139", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Grassley warns Roberts and the justices to stay out of political fight.", "title": "So far, Supreme Court has found unanimity in silence on Garland nomination", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/so-far-supreme-court-has-found-unanimity-in-silence-on-garland-nomination/2016/04/10/e9da30de-fdba-11e5-886f-a037dba38301_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2016/04/10/National-Politics/Images/US-Supreme_Court-Sotomayor-09102.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@scotusreporter"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/so-far-supreme-court-has-found-unanimity-in-silence-on-garland-nomination/2016/04/10/e9da30de-fdba-11e5-886f-a037dba38301_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "courts, supreme court, court politics, scalia, merrick garland, grassley", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/robert.barnes.3139"}, "eomportal-uuid": "e9da30de-fdba-11e5-886f-a037dba38301", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "courts, supreme court, court politics, scalia, merrick garland, grassley"}, "article_summary": "Justice Sonia Sotomayor, seen here at a Nov. 17, 2015 event in Richmond, hasn\u2019t spoken publicly about the latest Supreme Court nomination.\nHe was reacting to remarks that Chief Justice John G.
