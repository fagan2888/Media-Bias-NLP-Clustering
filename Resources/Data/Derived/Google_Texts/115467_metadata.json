This makes sense: the book is a compilation of her lifetime\u2019s work, a meaningful effort by any measurement.\n\nIn a lecture to Harvard students, Noonan discusses working at the White House the day the Challenger blew up: \u201cSometimes, and I\u2019m not sure it happens more than half a dozen times in a professional life, you will have a day, or a week, or a moment, or a season, when you think to yourself, \u2018This is why I\u2019m here. This is why I\u2019m in this office on this day. This is why God put me here.\u2019 I had one of those days that day.\u201d But even less dramatic days seem to have provided opportunities for beneficial labors.\n\nSometimes the work collected here takes aim at her own side. Despite her conservative record, Noonan has often gone after those leading the Republican Party. But it was typically friendly criticism: pieces collected here do not scold, so much as point to alternatives.\n\nIn this volume, we are reminded that Noonan did not care for President George W. Bush\u2019s Inaugural Address in 2005 and was not afraid to write that opinion. Despite immediate pushback and questions of her loyalty to the administration, she defended her claim that Bush\u2019s speech was grandiose without any realistic possibility of follow through. She also sounded the alarm after Romney\u2019s infamous \u201c47 percent\u201d gaffe, a misstep that may very well have cost him the election. Noonan did not try to soothe concerns or defend his words; she called for an intervention within the Romney campaign to avoid petty calculation and right the Republican Party.\n\nNoonan often strikes an elegiac tone in this collection, reflecting on lost friends and personal heroes like Joan Rivers, Tim Russert, Margaret Thatcher, and, of course, her boss Ronald Reagan. In her eulogy for Russert, Noonan offers this challenge: \u201cQuestion: When you die, are people in your profession going to feel like this? Why not? What can you do better?\u201d Thatcher, Noonan says, never shied away from her gender. But she found no virtue in victimhood, unlike some notable others. And Noonan\u2019s effusive praise of Reagan demonstrates the pride she wears for serving in the administration: \u201cTo be young and working in his White House at that time in human history was\u2014well, we felt privileged to be there, with him. He made us feel not that we were born in a time of trouble, but that we\u2019d been born at a time when we could end some trouble.\u201d\n\nFrom a detailed breakdown of the flaws of Obamacare, to stories about little-known fallen heroes, Noonan\u2019s collection is reflective of the wide range of materials she has worked with as a journalist. The Wall Street Journal columnist often celebrates the unique freedoms offered in this land, bemoans the vulgarity of Hollywood, condemns the divisiveness in Washington, and reflects on a post 9/11 trauma era. Noonan\u2019s writing always seems to be striving for moments to showcase the good in America. In another life, she would have found meaningful work as a teacher teacher\u2014which, in a sense, she has become, with her lucky readers filling the role of students.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "Evident in every speech, column, news report, or lecture in Peggy Noonan\u2019s collection, The Time of Our Lives, is the author\u2019s respect for the virtue of work, and for meaningful work, at that.
