Where we\u2019re going, we don\u2019t need roads!\u201d\n\nThat was Doc Brown, the mad scientist of \u201cBack to the Future\u201d fame \u2014 and today, Oct. 21, 2015, is the future date he and Marty McFly plugged into the DeLorean in the movie\u2019s 1989 hit sequel.\n\nIn that futuristic world, Americans enjoyed any number of advanced technologies: flying cars, hoverboards, power-lacing shoes, you name it. And who could blame us for thinking this was possible by 2015? The \u201980s was one of the most economically strong decades in history, driven by falling taxes, a strengthening dollar and deregulation of entire industries. As far as anyone was concerned, the only way was up \u2014 and we were going there fast.\n\nYet while technology has certainly advanced since then, it has been far surpassed by the growth of our government. The massive regulatory state has stifled countless entrepreneurs and innovators since Doc Brown and Marty McFly\u2019s heyday.\n\nAs a result, the boundless possibilities we saw in \u201cBack to the Future\u201d have too often been held back by bureaucratic proliferation.\n\nJust look at the explosion in federal regulations. According to the Competitive Enterprise Institute, last year there were 77,687 pages of federal regulations that cost American consumers and businesses nearly $1.9 trillion. The Obama administration alone has added more than $600 billion in annual economic costs.\n\nThat\u2019s money that could develop the next world-changing technology, surpassing the personal computer, the iPhone, or the self-driving car. Instead, it\u2019s going to lawyers, accountants, and lobbyists \u2014 none of whom move America forward.\n\nThere have also been unprecedented government intrusions into entire industries. While both parties have played their part, two of the worst examples have happened under the Obama administration: the Affordable Care Act and the Dodd-Frank financial legislation.\n\nWhile the Affordable Care Act may have been passed with noble intentions, it has turned American health care into a monolithic bureaucracy. Its 2,700 pages of legislation and accompanying 13,000 pages of new regulations have put a straitjacket on insurers, physicians and patients. This has spurred a mass consolidation of the health-care industry, leaving the rest of us with higher costs and fewer options.\n\nDodd-Frank is hardly any better. This single federal law has spawned 398 new regulations that added $22 billion in compliance costs and 61 million hours of paperwork each year.\n\nThis is crippling to small- and mid-size banks, the ones making most of the small business loans that spur entrepreneurship and innovation. Thanks to the regulatory burdens they face, it\u2019s all but impossible to compete against the biggest banks. Goldman Sachs\u2019 CEO put it bluntly, saying federal regulation has \u201craised the barriers to entry higher than at any other time in modern history.\u201d Perversely, consumers also lose with fewer options at higher cost.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just the health-care and banking industries suffocating under an out-of-control federal government. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, more businesses are now dying than are being created, something that\u2019s never happened in recorded history.\n\nThat\u2019s not the future Doc Brown and Marty McFly imagined when they plugged Oct. 21, 2015, into the DeLorean. That\u2019s why it\u2019s imperative we elect leaders who will reverse this trend. We must get government out of the way so entrepreneurs and innovators can make the breakthroughs, the discoveries, the radical advances that seem like science fiction but could be right around the corner.\n\nThe next year will be crucial in determining whether this actually happens. As we evaluate the various candidates running for the White House, we should ask ourselves a simple question: Which candidate will actually bring us closer to making \u201cBack to the Future\u201d a reality?\n\nNancy Pfotenhauer is the president of MediaSpeak Strategies and the former chief economist for President George H.W.
