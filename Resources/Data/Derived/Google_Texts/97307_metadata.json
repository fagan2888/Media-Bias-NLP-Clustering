Some of it is the result of personal slights \u2013 real or perceived \u2013 that occurred during the nomination race. Some of it comes from establishment types who are terrified they can\u2019t control a President Trump. These folks will probably never vote for him.\n\nBut those people are louder than they are numerous. A lot of the conservatives whose votes Trump will need to beat Hillary Clinton are slow to get on board because they keep hearing Trump is not really a conservative. One of the most frequent claims of the #NeverTrump crowd is that Trump is actually a New York liberal posing as a conservative, and that he is in fact no different at all from Hillary.\n\nThose who believe this are concerned about Trump\u2019s history of taking liberal issue positions in the past, not to mention his financial support of the Clintons and other Democrats. They suspect his conversion to conservatism is not only recent but suspiciously convenient, and they take a rather dim view of conservative voters who they think got conned by it.\n\nI know Donald Trump well enough to know that\u2019s not true. He would never claim to have spent his life as a committed, ideological conservative. He\u2019s spent most of his life as a businessman, as have I. People in business think differently about how to solve problems. We don\u2019t just choose an ideological side and instantly embrace everything people on that side believe. We learn from our experiences how to think about problems and their solutions, and because those experiences are always happening, sometimes we change our minds.\n\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s so essential that Donald\u2019s general election campaign has to shift its focus to the solutions he wants to bring our nation. The media would rather focus on his most bombastic statements, so most people don\u2019t know he wants to replace our tax code with lower rates and a simpler structure. Most people don\u2019t know he wants to replace ObamaCare with the sort of free-market concept that conservatives have long been calling for.\n\nHis foreign policy speech two weeks ago was the sort of thing people need to hear more about, and Trump\u2019s campaign has to take the initiative to make sure they do. The news media don\u2019t care about substance, and they\u2019ll ignore Trump\u2019s issue positions unless he makes them the centerpiece of his campaign. He needs to do that.\n\nThis is not to say he shouldn\u2019t attack Hillary. He needs to, because Hillary\u2019s shortcomings and flaws are so glaring it would be irresponsible not to warn the nation what a mistake it would be making to elect her. The media will try to cover up her awfulness so it\u2019s up to the Trump campaign not to let them get away with it.\n\nBut Trump\u2019s path to victory now is to tell us more about how he would make America great again. It\u2019s a much better plan than most conservatives probably suspect because they haven\u2019t heard about it. If we\u2019re going to win this thing, and keep Hillary from getting her hands on the power she craves so badly, that needs to change and change right now.\n\nGet your copy of Herman Cain\u2019s new book, The Right Problems, here!", "article_metadata": {"description": "And only he can lead the discussion.
