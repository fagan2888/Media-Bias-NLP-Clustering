(AP) - Whatever Quinten Rollins lacks in actual on-field experience at cornerback position, the Green Bay Packers\u2019 second-round pick makes up for with his personality.\n\nRollins played four years of basketball at Miami of Ohio before going out for football with his final year of eligibility - and was the Mid-American Conference defensive player of the year.\n\nStill, one would have thought Rollins\u2019 transition to the NFL game with such limited football experience beyond his high school days would be more difficult than he has made it look.\n\nOn Thursday night in the preseason opener at New England, he broke up a pair of passes - including a potential touchdown - and had a hard hit on running back James White that caused another incompletion.\n\nWith the Packers playing without cornerback Damarious Randall, the team\u2019s first-round pick who sat out the game with a groin injury, it was something of a coming-out party for Rollins.\n\n\u201cHe had a nice night,\u201d Packers coach Mike McCarthy said Saturday before practice. \u201cHe did a lot of good things, particularly getting his hands on the ball. I\u2019m sure when you talk to him he\u2019s going to be disappointed he didn\u2019t have those two interceptions. But I thought he played very well, played with a lot of confidence.\n\n\u201cHe was definitely poised - and that\u2019s one thing you always look for in your rookies the first time they get out there.\u201d\n\nPoise is actually a key component of Rollins\u2019 game, and given the position he plays, that\u2019s important. In a pass-happy league, even the top cover men lose their one-on-one battles, and the better ones move on quickly to the next play.\n\n\u201cI played basketball. That aspect helps me. I was a point guard. You can\u2019t dwell on one play. You have to have a next-play mentality,\u201d Rollins said Saturday. \u201cThat\u2019s just kind of my nature. I\u2019m on to the next play. The next play is going to be coming at you, so you have to get ready for that one.\u201d\n\nThat approach was on display Saturday afternoon, as the Packers returned to practice following their 22-11 victory over the Patriots. As good as Rollins was in that game, he was beaten by rookie wide receiver Larry Pinkard on back-to-back plays during a competitive 2-minute drill at the end of practice - a 57-yarder from Brett Hundley and then an 8-yard touchdown.\n\n\u201cI definitely was not pleased with giving up those, especially not in 2-minute,\u201d Rollins said. \u201c(But) I feel like my personality goes right with the position. I\u2019ve just never been a real big guy on, \u2018Oh, I made one play, let\u2019s get excited.\u2019 That\u2019s your job. That\u2019s what you\u2019re supposed to do. Just play the game like it\u2019s supposed to be played and let the rest of it take care of itself.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s cornerback. You\u2019re not going to be perfect every play. That\u2019s what you strive for, you always strive for perfection, but that\u2019s a far-fetched idea.\u201d\n\nNOTES: Starting left tackle David Bakhtiari did not practice because of what a club spokesman said was a knee injury. Given that Bakhtiari was at practice, it\u2019s likely not a severe injury. \u2026 The Packers practiced in shells instead of pads Saturday, in part because it was the hottest day of camp with the heat index in the 90s. ..
