Meritus says that figure has since soared and exceeds projections.Adding the second report also more than doubled the losses reported by the co-op.Mary Kahn, a spokeswoman for the inspector general, said the HMO report was unavailable on the database it accessed and would not change the agency's conclusions or its recommendation.Kahn also noted that the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare services did not point out any discrepancies in its review of the audit before it was released.The AP search for annual reports on the insurance association's subscription-only public site pulled up both reports with ease.The federal analysis issued last month said Arizona's co-op had insured only 869 people by the end of 2014, its first year of operation. That number, however, was just for its PPO plan known as Meritus Mutual Health Partners.The company's HMO, Meritus Health Partners, signed up an additional 2,662 people, according to filings with regulators.The federal audit showed Meritus lost $7.2 million last year. But its two units actually lost a combined $16.6 million, according to the reports reviewed by the AP.Co-ops were set up as part of a compromise in the Affordable Care Act to compete with for-profit insurance companies.Overall, the inspector general said 13 of the 23 co-ops it reviewed had lower than projected signups and 21 had net losses.Enrollment in Meritus plans has surged this year as a result better marketing and improved operation of the government's insurance marketplace website, vice president Veronica Piotrowski said when the report was released. The company also lowered its premiums.Piotrowski said Thursday that the not-for-profit also believes the federal analysis missed the second filing, but the company hasn't asked for it to be changed.\"Frankly we're at this juncture not interested in having a debate with that agency,\" she said.She said the insurer now covers nearly 56,000 Arizonans and most of them bought their policies on the federal health insurance marketplace, boosting Meritus' marketplace share from less than 2% last year to 28% now, according to AP estimates.The AP began reviewing the discrepancies in the
