It's the girls right below that who came up with a really good meet.\"\n\nMonarch freshman Sidney Trimm sheds a winning smile after placing first in the 50 freestyle at the Boulder County Invitational.\n\nBeetcher won 200 and 500 freestyle races, setting a meet record in the 200 in 1 minute, 53.11 seconds (.59 better than Monarch's Anna Lobazon in 2010).\n\n\"I was super happy to get the record,\" Beetcher said. \"Even though it wasn't a personal best, I was still really proud of myself and it was fun to win it for Fairview.\"\n\nThe Knights scored a whopping 909 points, easily distancing themselves from second-place Monarch (524) and No. 3 Boulder (451). Fairview won nine of the 12 events, including triumphs by Box in the butterfly and backstroke.\n\n\"I'm pretty content with all my races today,\" Box said. \"None of them were bests, but they were all close so I'm super happy with where I am. Looking at state, I think I'm going to do pretty well.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFairview winners also included Sandra Freeman (200 individual medley) and Julia Benz (diving) in addition to victories in all three relays.\n\nThe Knights also had a goal of qualifying 24 swimmers for state this season. They qualified five new ones Saturday to push their total to 28. Included were Lucia Majeticova, Hannah Keay and Cassidy Waldrip (all in breastroke), Greta Dunn (butterfly) and Victoria Felton (50 and 100 free).\n\nMonarch freshman Sidney Trimm broke through the Fairview curtain to post two victories of her own. She won the 50 freestyle in 24.34 and the 100 free in 52.61.\n\n\"It feels good,\" Trimm said. \"We had some tough competition here and I just wanted to do the best for my team. It was a lot of fun.\"\n\nTrimm swims club with the Front Range Barracudas, who use VMAC as their home pool. She felt right at home in that regard and continued a stellar freshman season that's soon to make her a household name on the circuit.\n\n\"I thought I was going to do well this year, but it's a shock for me,\" said Trimm, who also assisted the Coyotes to a third-place finish in the medley relay amd a second-place finish in the 200 freestyle relay.\n\nMonarch also got good production from Courtney Roeber (fourth in 50 free), Brie Yost (fifth in 500 free) and diver Savannah Magness, who finished second.\n\nThe only other non-Fairview winner was Niwot's Hannah Driscoll, a breaststroke extraordinaire who won the event in 1:06.26.\n\nBoulder earned its third-place finish despite competing without standouts Amanda Richey, Natasha Reidenbach and Miranda Sullivan, who were at club meets. Panthers sophomore Josie Valette finished fourth in the 200 IM and sixth in the butterfly, and junior Hannah Varner placed sixth in each the 200 and 500 free style.\n\n\"Varner got her cut for the 200 free which was good, because we've had nine individual people qualify for state,\" said Boulder coach Curt Colby, who team also posted two top-four relay finishes. \"Josie was solid and a couple other girls saw some drops.\"\n\nContact BoCoPreps.com Writer Paul Willis at willisp@dailycamera.com\n\n\n\n\n\nBoulder County Invitational\n\nAt Veterans Memorial Aquatic Center\n\nTeam scores \u2014 Fairview 909, Monarch 524, Boulder 451, Niwot 359.5, Chatfield 306, Silver Creek 269, Broomfield 262, Centaurus 195.5, Skyline 154, Arapahoe 60, Longmont 27, Mountain Range 22, Legacy 21.\n\n200 medley relay \u2014 1.
