Police are searching for suspects after two Wichita businesses were robbed Saturday evening.

The first robbery happened around 5:20 p.m. at the Phillips 66 Express at 565 North Market, just north of Kellogg. The clerk told officers two men with handguns entered the store and demanded money and cigarettes.

The clerk complied, and the suspects left the scene.

Twenty minutes later, two teen boys with handguns entered the Arby's at 4308 East Harry. That's just west of Oliver. Again, the suspects demanded money and were last seen exiting the fast food restaurant with an unknown amount of cash.

There is no indication from police that these crimes are connected. Anyone with information is asked to call Wichita police or Crime Stoppers at (316) 267-2111.
