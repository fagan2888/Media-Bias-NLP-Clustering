Rotation matters. In the last two games, the Nuggets have doled out the lion\u2019s share of the minutes to these five players \u2013 Ty Lawson, Arron Afflalo, Wilson Chandler, Kenneth Faried, Timofey Mozgov. Here\u2019s how that breaks down: Those five, the Nuggets\u2019 starting five, have played 44 minutes out of a possible 96, so 45 percent of the time.\n\nTwo other lineups have played 16 minutes apiece. The first one is the reserve five: Randy Foye, Nate Robinson, Danilo Gallinari, Darrell Arthur and JaVale McGee. The second one is the starting lineup minus Faried. What that means is the quartet of Lawson, Afflalo, Chandler and Mozgov have played 60 out of the possible 96 minutes (62.5 percent) in the last two games. It is a huge shift from the more even-handed approach to handing out court time that coach Brian Shaw has become known for. But most importantly for the Nuggets, is proving to pay dividends with players able to get in a groove, and for the team with back-to-back victories.\n\n2. Wilson Chandler. Chandler did a little bit of everything on Wednesday night. He moved well without the ball, which resulted in a number of good looks for him. And he was just in a good rhythm with his jump shot. He was frequently used in screen/roll action with Ty Lawson and popped open for good looks. He didn\u2019t settle for just jump shots, and took the ball to the rim a few times as well. And he rebounded well, obviously, with nine on the night.\n\nHis help on the defensive glass has been a big reason why Nuggets\u2019 defensive stops have not resulted in offensive rebounds by the opponent in recent games. The bonus for the Nuggets is when he gets the ball, he\u2019s a capable ball handler and can sprint the ball to the front court for a fast break layup/dunk or to initiate the offense. Quietly, Wilson Chandler has been putting together a solid season on both ends of the court. His rebounding is up over last season and lately he\u2019s starting to find the range with his shot.\n\n3. Limiting turnovers. In the midst of areas that need improving is one that has quietly been a boon for the Nuggets early on: Keeping the turnovers to a minimum. They turned the ball over just nine times against Oklahoma City, which was the second time this season that they\u2019ve had fewer than 10 in a game. Their season average of 13.8 to this point is the lowest turnover average in team history. You read that right: Team History. If they finish the season anywhere under 13.9, they\u2019ll set a new franchise record for lowest turnover average in a season.\n\nThe Nuggets have not had a game in which they\u2019ve committed more than 17 turnovers thus far \u2014 last season they had 17 games of 20 or more. Last season, the Nuggets averaged 15.9, so they are down a smidge over 2 per game this season. The biggest drop is with Randy Foye, who has shaved a full turnover of his average from last season so far, going from 1.8 to 0.8. I know you\u2019re wondering: Ty Lawson has held steady. He finished with 3.2 turnovers per game last season, and that\u2019s his average so far this season.\n\nChristopher Dempsey: @dempseypost or cdempsey@denverpost.com", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Arron Afflalo,Brian Shaw,Chris Dempsey,Denver,JaVale McGee,Kenneth Faried,Nate Robinson,Nuggets,Randy Foye,Timofey Mozgov,Ty Lawson,Wilson Chandler", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"site_name": "Nuggets Ink", "description": "Observations from the Nuggets game on Wednesday night against Oklahoma City.", "title": "The Morning After: 3 Nuggets vs. Thunder observations", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/nuggets/2014/11/20/morning-3-nuggets-vs-thunder-observations/12109/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/nuggets/files/2014/11/NATEROBOKC-495x419.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Observations from the Nuggets game on Wednesday night against Oklahoma City.", "title": "The Morning After: 3 Nuggets vs. Thunder observations", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/nuggets/2014/11/20/morning-3-nuggets-vs-thunder-observations/12109/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/nuggets/files/2014/11/NATEROBOKC-495x419.jpg", "creator": "@dempseyPost", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "language": "en, sv", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Observations from the Nuggets game on Wednesday night against Oklahoma City."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc1d2\"", "article_summary": "Their season average of 13.8 to this point is the lowest turnover average in team history.\nLast season, the Nuggets averaged 15.9, so they are down a smidge over 2 per game this season.\nHe finished with 3.2 turnovers per game last season, and that\u2019s his average so far this season.\nHere\u2019s how that breaks down: Those five, the Nuggets\u2019 starting five, have played 44 minutes out of a possible 96, so 45 percent of the time.\nIn the last two games, the Nuggets have doled out the lion\u2019s share of the minutes to these five players \u2013 Ty Lawson, Arron Afflalo, Wilson Chandler, Kenneth Faried, Timofey Mozgov."}
