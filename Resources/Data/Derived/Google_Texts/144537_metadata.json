The proper response to his executive orders threatening gun rights is thus to recognize and uphold a national duty to bear arms. Here\u2019s why.\n\nObama seethes in anger at a Congress that protects the fundamental Second Amendment and claims that \u201cgun violence\u201d is \u201cone of the greatest threats to public health and to the safety of the American people.\u201d Yet \u201cgun violence\u201d doesn\u2019t exist. It is as much a chimera as \u201ccar violence,\u201d \u201calcohol violence,\u201d \u201cknife violence,\u201d \u201crock violence,\u201d \u201cpower tool violence,\u201d \u201cswimming pool violence,\u201d \u201cdoctor violence,\u201d \u201ccigarette violence,\u201d and \u201cmedicine violence.\u201d\n\nForty thousand Americans die in traffic accidents every year, a third of these from drunk driving. In each case, the drunk driver, not the car, caused the fatality. And since Cain smashed Abel\u2019s head with a rock, people have killed with knives, hammers, clubs, fists, ropes, poison, and pillows, yet none of these objects acted independently.\n\nHundreds of thousands of Americans are killed every year by power tools, physicians, drugs, cigarettes, and swimming pools. But a human act or omission, rather than violence by any inanimate object, caused each death.\n\nGuns are no different. They become deadly only through human action.\n\nGuns are not the problem; Obama\u2019s gun control is no solution\n\nSo, when people commit crimes using guns, the solution is to deter and punish these criminals. But the Left, unwilling to enforce existing laws, has conjured up the dishonest phrase \u201cgun violence\u201d to shift responsibility away from criminals. For if guns commit \u201cgun violence,\u201d it is guns, rather than criminals, that merit apprehension, confinement, and destruction. That this narrative is false is irrelevant to liberals whose primary objective is banning guns.\n\nThis is a travesty. The right to keep and bear arms is, per the Supreme Court, an \u201cancient and fundamental right\u201d recognized by the Second Amendment to enable Americans to defend themselves, particularly against a tyrannical government. No other tangible object is the subject of such extensive constitutional protection.\n\nIndeed, hundreds of thousands of times a year, guns prevent injury and death. Men closed Auschwitz and opened Southern universities to blacks using guns. Women deter and kill rapists with guns. By Obama\u2019s bizarre logic, these might be labeled acts of \u201cgun peace.\u201d But guns are dumb hunks of metal, no better or worse than the humans using them and the ends to which they are put.\n\nObama\u2019s \u201cgun violence\u201d executive orders are addressed in detail elsewhere. It suffices to note the most egregious. One modifies federal privacy laws to allow government access to confidential medical records in deciding whether to permit gun sales. Veterans might find post-traumatic stress associated with their service strips them of their gun rights.\n\nParents will suffer pediatricians authorized to ask their children whether Mommy or Daddy have guns.\n\nHealthcare providers and the Social Security Administration can report the bare fact of gun possession by disabled seniors to the Department of Homeland Security. Individuals whose guns are improperly seized by police will find it harder to compel their return. And mental health is now politicized: outspoken conservatives, registered Republicans, even those who merely challenge the \u201cgun violence narrative\u201d in cyberspace may find themselves branded \u201ccrazy\u201d and unfit to possess guns by federal bureaucrats.\n\nSurgeon General appointee confirms Obamacare\u2019s gun control agenda\n\nThat Obama, whose fidelity to the Constitution mirrors Bill Clinton\u2019s fidelity to Hillary, bypassed Congress with unlawful executive orders is no surprise. His attack on the Second Amendment\u2014the \u201cmaster right\u201d that guarantees the others by enabling American armed resistance to tyranny\u2014is deliberate. Obama\u2019s ultimate goal, and that of his would-be successor Hillary Clinton, is gun confiscation.\n\nOnly by making the U.S. a \u201cgun-free zone\u201d can the Constitution be shredded\u2014a precondition for the triumph of the radical progressivism of Obama, Clinton, and their ilk.\n\nOf course, gun-free zones don\u2019t just infringe the Second Amendment. They advertise the availability of defenseless innocents to criminals and terrorists looking to kill quickly and in volume at near-zero risk. Gun-free zones are murder magnets that attract lawless evildoers and stand as monuments to sheepish idiocy.\n\nOpponents of the Obama gun-grab call for businesses and municipalities imposing gun-free zones to guarantee the safety of those entering them. Others would ban gun-free zones under \u201cguns everywhere\u201d legislation some form of which is in place in 28 States that legalizes gun possession in all places.\n\nBut these are partial measures. The \u201cObama 180 Degree Rule\u201d mandates a diametrically opposed policy.\n\nHere it is. Instead of disarming Americans and converting the U.S. into a gun-free zone, let\u2019s require all American adults to be armed. The Second Amendment guarantees the right to keep and bear arms, but does not compel anyone to do so. Let\u2019s go a step further. Let\u2019s impose a national duty to keep and bear arms. Crazy?\n\nNo. This duty is already law in municipalities in Southern, Rocky Mountain, Northeastern states, and elsewhere. Most of these towns lack funds to pay for police officers and require each individual to own an operable firearm as part of his or her responsibility to individual and public safety. Those with mental or physical disabilities, conscientious objectors, convicted felons, and persons too poor to purchase a gun are exempt.\n\nViolations incur only a small civil fine.\n\nAnd costly threats to public safety aren\u2019t a uniquely U.S. affliction, nor is widespread bearing of arms confined to our shores. The top Swiss military officer recently urged vigilance due to the risk of terrorism and rape posed by Islamist \u201crefugees\u201d violating his country. Despite their neutrality, the Swiss are a heavily-armed people who carry guns openly in public and root firearm ownership in a civic duty to defend their nation and its identity. Not coincidentally, the Swiss have been independent and war-free for centuries.\n\nGuns, gun laws and the Second Amendment\n\nAdvocates of a civic \u201cduty to keep and bear arms\u201d to ensure individual and public safety can cite Supreme Court opinions upholding its wisdom and constitutionality.\n\nIn 2005, the Court ruled police have no legal duty to protect and that an individual\u2019s self-defense is his own responsibility. So we\u2019re on our own against bad guys.\n\nAnd in 2012, the Court allowed Congress to tax those who refuse to buy health insurance because sooner or later everyone needs healthcare and it is unfair for uninsureds to shift the cost of the free care the law mandates they receive onto others. Thus, per ObamaCare, individuals must either purchase insurance or make a \u201cshared responsibility payment\u201d of 2.5% of their incomes. Everyone has a social responsibility to participate, to the extent of their financial ability, in insuring their own health. No one can \u201cfree-ride\u201d off others.\n\nIn effect, with Obamacare, Congress declared healthcare a public good\u2014meaning it is beneficial to all, no one can be excluded from it, and access by one does not reduce availability to others\u2014while solving the free-rider problem by making the purchase of insurance an individual duty.\n\nSo too, then, is public safety a public good. We all need it but can\u2019t know when or where it will be threatened. Military personnel and those who keep and bear arms wherever they go provide public safety against terrorists and criminals while subsidizing those who do not serve and are unarmed. On the theory elaborated by Congress in ObamaCare and blessed by the Court, individuals cannot free ride and must insure their individual and public safety, either through military service, arms-bearing, and/or by making a \u201cshared responsibility payment\u201d based on income.\n\nIndeed, it is unfair for those who perform no military service and bear no arms to shift their safety costs onto others. A 2.5% tax on the incomes of free-riders would induce some military service, convince some Americans to arm themselves, and generate revenue to fund needed military and police services and subsidize firearm and ammunition purchases by arms-bearers. All of these rational responses would enhance individual and public safety.\n\nGeorge Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley and other liberals brand a duty to keep and bear arms unconstitutional and \u201cmoronic\u201d because it compels doing something some oppose philosophically. But so does ObamaCare. So too do many of the responsibilities of citizenship impose unwelcome burdens.\n\nBy the logic Congress adopted and the Court blessed in mandating individuals purchase health insurance or be taxed as part of their social responsibility, Americans are duty-bound to contribute to individual and public safety through taxes, military service, or the bearing of arms.\n\nAux armes, citoyens! To arms, citizens! A national \u201cduty to bear arms\u201d protects us and guards against tyranny. And it directly opposes Obama\u2019s recent edicts. That alone guarantees that it\u2019s the right policy for America.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The proper response to President Obama's executive orders threatening gun rights is to recognize a national duty to bear arms.", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "author": "William Brute Bradford", "og": {"site_name": "Communities Digital News", "description": "The proper response to President Obama\u2019s executive orders threatening gun rights is to recognize a national duty to bear arms.", "title": "Defying Obama\u2019s gun grab: A national duty to bear arms", "url": "http://www.commdiginews.com/politics-2/opposing-obamas-gun-grab-a-national-duty-to-bear-arms-55671/", "image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://www.commdiginews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/BattleofLongisland-800.jpg", "height": 482}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The proper response to President Obama's executive orders threatening gun rights is to recognize a national duty to bear arms.", "title": "Defying Obama's gun grab: A national duty to bear arms", "image": "http://www.commdiginews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/BattleofLongisland-800.jpg", "creator": "@commdiginews", "site": "@commdiginews", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "barack obama,election 2016,second amendment,gun control,gun rights,islamist terrorism,republican,terrorism,u.s. military,u.s. supreme court", "propeller": "a20eada6e38f74d5c5bf31354ee9760c", "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-12T19:54:36+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-17T19:21:19+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Barack Obama, election 2016, gun control, Islamist terrorism, republican, second amendment, terrorism, U.S. military, U.S. Supreme Court"}, "article_summary": "It is as much a chimera as \u201ccar violence,\u201d \u201calcohol violence,\u201d \u201cknife violence,\u201d \u201crock violence,\u201d \u201cpower tool violence,\u201d \u201cswimming pool violence,\u201d \u201cdoctor violence,\u201d \u201ccigarette violence,\u201d and \u201cmedicine violence.\u201dForty thousand Americans die in traffic accidents every year, a third of these from drunk driving.\nThe proper response to his executive orders threatening gun rights is thus to recognize and uphold a national duty to bear arms.\nA national \u201cduty to bear arms\u201d protects us and guards against tyranny.\nThe Second Amendment guarantees the right to keep and bear arms, but does not compel anyone to do so.\nFor if guns commit \u201cgun violence,\u201d it is guns, rather than criminals, that merit apprehension, confinement, and destruction."}
