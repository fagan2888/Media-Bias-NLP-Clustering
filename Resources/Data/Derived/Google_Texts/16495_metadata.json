Susan Collins Susan CollinsGOP lawmaker: 'Republicans were wrong\u2019 to block Garland Senate passes broad spending bill with .1B in Zika funds Senators unveil bill to overhaul apprenticeship programs MORE (R-Maine) and Claire McCaskill Claire McCaskillSanders aide: Easier for Dems to unify if Wasserman Schultz steps down Dem senator: DNC head \u2018has to make a decision\u2019 on her own future Wasserman Schultz fights to keep her job MORE (D-Mo.), is scheduled to hold a hearing Wednesday featuring the CEO of embattled drugmaker Valeant Pharmaceuticals.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe executive, Michael Pearson, is slated to make his long-awaited appearance about two weeks after standing up the committee and violating a subpoena. His absence had Collins and McCaskill threatening to hold him in contempt, though they said he later reversed course and agreed to testify.\n\nValeant has drawn scorn for its drug pricing strategy, which critics liken to price-gouging. The company, along with Turing Pharmaceuticals, drew widespread public scorn after word spread about its practice of buying the rights to decades-old drugs and then quickly raising prices.\n\nBeyond Capitol Hill, a pair of influential policy groups plan to hold events on drug pricing.\n\nOn Monday, the Campaign for Responsible Drug Pricing is scheduled to unveil a slate of \"market-based policy solutions\" that it says will help control price increases.\n\nIts event, at the Newseum, is slated to feature leaders from across the healthcare sector: the American Hospital Association, AARP, American College of Physicians and Kaiser Permanente will be represented.\n\nOn Tuesday, the liberal think tank Center for American Progress plans to also hold a drug pricing summit, featuring Rep. Lloyd Doggett (D-Texas) and representatives from AARP, Quest Diagnostics and the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.\n\nMarilyn Tavenner, president and CEO of America's Health Insurance Plans, is scheduled to speak. The summit will be moderated by Dr. Zeke Emanuel, an influential voice in the first drafts of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nMany of the groups speaking out this week are major players in the drug pricing debate, from insurers to doctors. But so far, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America remains absent.\n\nElsewhere on Capitol Hill, the House Energy and Commerce Committee is scheduled to take up a package of bipartisan bills to fight opioid abuse. GOP leaders are hoping to bring those bills \u2013 mostly noncontroversial \u2013 to the floor the first week of May.\n\nThe House's package would then be combined with a Senate's, which passed in March. Neither would provide new funding to fight the epidemic, though they would redirect existing funds.\n\nWorking toward another bipartisanship initiative, the Senate Finance Committee is hoping to move forward on reforming the mental healthcare system and has planned a hearing on Thursday.\n\nThe Senate GOP is also trying to advance a Zika funding package, which could be attached to an appropriations bill on the floor in the coming week. Lawmakers in charge of the emergency package have declined to say how much money it is scheduled to include, but it is sure to fall short of President Obama's $2 billion request.\n\nRecent stories:\n\nUnitedHealth pulling out of most ObamaCare markets: http://bit.ly/1T44zBD\n\nSuicide rate hits 30-year high: http://bit.ly/1rqvYYC\n\nHouse opioid response is scheduled to not include new funding: http://bit.ly/1VN6iBA\n\nRepublicans, Dems battle over new documents in fetal tissue probe: http://bit.ly/1NG1qpZ\n\nGOP group promises ObamaCare replacement plan -- soon: http://bit.ly/1NollyM", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "A Senate committee will hear from the CEO of embattled drugmaker Valeant.", "description": "A Senate committee will hear from the CEO of embattled drugmaker Valeant.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Sarah Ferris", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "A Senate committee will hear from the CEO of embattled drugmaker Valeant.", "title": "Week ahead: Drug pricing back in focus", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/277330-week-ahead-drug-pricing-back-in-focus", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-04-25T06:00:01-04:00", "type": "article"}, "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-04-25T06:00-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/277330-week-ahead-drug-pricing-back-in-focus", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "dcterms.date": "2016-04-25T06:00-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Meghashyam Mali", "dcterms.type": "Text", "article": {"published_time": "2016-04-25T06:00:26-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-25T06:00:01-04:00"}, "keywords": ",Claire McCaskill, Susan Collins,", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/277330-week-ahead-drug-pricing-back-in-focus", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "A Senate committee will hear from the CEO of embattled drugmaker Valeant.", "card": "summary", "title": "Week ahead: Drug pricing back in focus"}, "dcterms.title": "Week ahead: Drug pricing back in focus"}, "article_summary": "Many of the groups speaking out this week are major players in the drug pricing debate, from insurers to doctors.\nValeant has drawn scorn for its drug pricing strategy, which critics liken to price-gouging.\nLawmakers from both parties are trying to make clear they're serious about fair drug pricing, a topic likely to dominate healthcare headlines in the coming week.\nBeyond Capitol Hill, a pair of influential policy groups plan to hold events on drug pricing.\nOn Monday, the Campaign for Responsible Drug Pricing is scheduled to unveil a slate of \"market-based policy solutions\" that it says will help control price increases."}
