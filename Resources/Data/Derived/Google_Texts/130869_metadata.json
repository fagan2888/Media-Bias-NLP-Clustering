Justice Scalia relentlessly\u2026 drove the message that many of the ideas that are out there today are inconsistent with the rule of law and the American tradition.\u201d\n\nSessions noted on that Scalia\u2019s approach was at odds with most jurists when he was first appointed to the High Court by President Ronald Reagan.\n\n\u201cThe Constitution, they say, is a \u2018living\u2019 document,\u201d Sessions explained. \u201cHow ridiculous is that? The judges said that because it gave them the power to update it and advance it and make it say what they would wish it to say.\u201d\n\nScalia was known for his \u201ctextualist\u201d reading of the Constitution, which adheres strictly to the meaning of the actual text, rather than taking into account legislative history or other external variables.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a living document,\u201d Scalia remarked in 2013. \u201cIt\u2019s dead, dead, dead.\u201d\n\n(Video below: Sessions discusses Scalia on the Senate floor)\n\nSessions noted how Justice Scalia\u2019s philosophy changed the legal world. He recalled his time as a law student at the University of Alabama when the idea of Judicial Activism dominated the mainstream.\n\n\u201cThis has been a long, tough, intellectual battle,\u201d he said, declaring his support to Scalia\u2019s theory that the Constitution is a contract that grants the federal government limited powers.\n\nSessions also praised Scalia for his commitment to religious freedom.\n\n(Video below: Sessions discusses Scalia\u2019s stance on religious liberty)\n\nTo Sessions, Scalia was instrumental for protecting the expression of faith in the public realm.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ve forgotten the free exercise clause and I think we\u2019ve misinterpreted the establishment of religion clause,\u201d he said.\n\nThe court will be hearing a religious freedom challenge to ObamaCare this term, where a group of nuns has challenged the contraception mandate of ObamaCare on First Amendment grounds.\n\nGiven the current makeup of the court, the result in these religious freedom cases is up in the air.", "article_metadata": {"description": "On the floor of the U.S. Senate, Jeff Sessions recognized the tremendous accomplishments of Justice Scalia and the need for another conservative judge", "og": {"site_name": "Yellowhammer News", "description": "WASHINGTON, D.C. \u2014 Senator Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) on Monday took to the Senate floor to remember the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, who passed away one month ago after[...]", "title": "Sessions hails Scalia as 'one of the greatest Justices ever,' slams 'living' Constitution theory - Yellowhammer News", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 820, "identifier": "http://yellowhammernews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/SessionsScalia.jpg", "height": 410}, "updated_time": "2016-03-15T14:17:00-05:00", "url": "http://yellowhammernews.com/politics-2/sessions-hails-scalia-slams-living-constitution/", "type": "article"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "1bb21e647809aaf739789565c0783008"}, "fb": {"pages": 303363616352436}, "article": {"section": "Politics", "tag": "U.S. Senate", "published_time": "2016-03-14T15:58:41-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-15T14:17:00-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "\u201cI think we\u2019ve forgotten the free exercise clause and I think we\u2019ve misinterpreted the establishment of religion clause,\u201d he said.\n(Video below: Sessions discusses Scalia\u2019s stance on religious liberty)To Sessions, Scalia was instrumental for protecting the expression of faith in the public realm.\n\u201cIt\u2019s dead, dead, dead.\u201d(Video below: Sessions discusses Scalia on the Senate floor)Sessions noted how Justice Scalia\u2019s philosophy changed the legal world.\n\u201cThe Constitution, they say, is a \u2018living\u2019 document,\u201d Sessions explained.\nSessions also praised Scalia for his commitment to religious freedom."}
