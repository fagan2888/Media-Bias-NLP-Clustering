James Inhofe (R-Okla.) said a pair of Republican senators will have to find a different way to bring a renewal of the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) to the floor rather than blocking a chemical bill they hope to attach it to.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSens.(R-N.C.) and(R-N.H.) are stopping the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) reform bill from hitting the Senate floor unless they get a vote on the LWCF as well. On Monday, Burr told Politico , \u201cI\u2019ll allow it to the floor if it\u2019s open for amendment, even if it\u2019s limited to one amendment.\u201d\n\nBut Inhofe said TSCA isn\u2019t the right vehicle for the measure.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a germane amendment,\u201d he said after a press conference plugging TSCA on Thursday. \u201cThey need to find something else for their amendment and I think they will.\u201d\n\nSen. Tom Udall Tom UdallHonor Frank Lautenberg by protecting our kids House, Senate roll out chemical safety compromise Overnight Energy: Lawmakers closing in on chemical safety deal MORE (D-N.M.), a lead TSCA sponsor, agreed.\n\n\u201cI think he wants a vote [on LWCF], and he should get a vote, and we\u2019re going to work with him on that,\u201d Udall said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to try to work through this so we can get the bill to the floor as it is.\u201d\n\nBackers of the TSCA bill secured their 60th co-sponsor last week, setting up an effort to soon push the legislation through the Senate, with Udall suggesting a window as early as this Thursday.\n\nA varied group of senators and interest groups \u2014 ranging from the Environmental Defense Fund to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce \u2014 rallied outside the Capitol to promote the bill on Tuesday.\n\nBut Burr and others, still stinging from seeing the LWCF\u2019s authorization lapse last week, want to tie the two popular provisions together into one package.\n\nBurr is a co-sponsor of the TSCA bill and Udall said he supports an extension of the conservation fund. But Udall said Tuesday that linking them together could end up sinking the chemical legislation.\n\n\u201cThe thing that happens: As soon as you open up one amendment, then you\u2019ve opened it up to 100 amendments,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve seen that happen many times around here, where as soon as you get to that point, you don\u2019t get a bill. And I think all of us want to see a bill.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Sens. Burr and Ayotte are holding up a long-sought chemical reform bill.", "description": "Sens.
