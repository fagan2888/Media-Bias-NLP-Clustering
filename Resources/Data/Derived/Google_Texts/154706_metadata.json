As displaced residents returned after Hurricane Katrina, medical staff adjusted locations, hours and even the type of care they offered, depending on what was needed.\n\nMoments like these are rare in the field of medicine, which is so often hidebound by payment models and protocol. \u201cWe put the population in front and evolved the model to wrap around the patients,\u201d says Dr. Karen DeSalvo, who helped to create what became a citywide network of safety-net clinics and continued to work closely on the issue during her tenure as city health commissioner.\n\nSpurred by generous post-disaster funding, 52 neighborhood clinics in four parishes (Louisiana\u2019s term for counties) quickly evolved and have largely replaced a less-efficient pre-Katrina system. As the Affordable Care Act and its wave of newly insured patients force cities to ramp up numbers of primary-care clinics despite a national primary-care doctor shortage, the New Orleans experience could prove instructive, says DeSalvo. \u201cNew Orleans had some of the lowest rates in primary-care providers \u2013 it used to be at the bottom of the pile. This shows that you can quickly build primary-care access. It can be done.\u201d\n\nThe New Orleans clinics also broke new ground by pairing mental and physical healthcare, sharing electronic records, agreeing on uniform coding for common conditions such as diabetes \u2013 which sometimes carried a number of different codes even within the same hospital \u2013 and by determining payment based upon certain indicators of quality, including patient-satisfaction ratings.\n\nThe fast-moving process was able to create distinctly different clinics for patients, because each clinic expanded based on existing strongpoints such as mammography, for instance, or dental care, med-school training, or Latino or homeless patient outreach. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t as though the flood walls broke, there was water, and somebody said, \u2018We\u2019ll create 88 medical homes and XYZ,\u2019\u201d says DeSalvo, likening the process to a jazz performance rather than a conductor-directed, structured symphony. \u201cEverybody had a strength, like an instrument,\u201d she says.\n\nThe network reaped national acclaim. \u201cAfter the healthcare safety net was destroyed in New Orleans, they built something new and better from the ground up,\u201d says Melinda Abrams, vice president of delivery-system reform for the Commonwealth Fund, which has supported evaluation of the New Orleans network and finds it greatly improved, although \u201cnot a grand-slam on every single dimension.\u201d\n\nIts weakest point may be lack of sustainability. Despite its successes, the New Orleans clinics have yet to find a stable source of funding to cover working-poor parents whose income tops $2,801 each year \u2013 Louisiana\u2019s paltry Medicaid threshold for non-disabled adults \u2013 but is less than $11,670 annually, which would qualify them for subsidized care under the Affordable Care Act. Unless Louisiana accepts Medicaid expansion, the clinics will always need financial help providing care to those parents and another broad segment of the city\u2019s population: low-income single adults, who are never eligible for Medicaid in Louisiana unless they have children or are pregnant.\n\nAt one point, it looked like stability was close, because the uninsured patients would have been covered by Medicaid if Louisiana had chosen expansion. Instead, funding is slated to run out this summer, the latest in a series of near-death experiences for the network. \u201cIt\u2019s a constant crisis,\u201d says Susan Todd, executive director of 504HealthNet, a nonprofit clinic collaborative.\n\nBefore Hurricane Katrina, there were a handful of safety-net clinics, but most patients went through Charity Hospital, known as Big Charity, which served as the hub of a system of public hospitals in Louisiana that provided care for the poor. The massive concrete building near City Hall may have been built into the shape of an H for better air flow, but legend says it was in honor of Gov. Huey P. Long, the egalitarian egoist who commissioned the new hospital in the 1930s.\n\nThe hospital\u2019s care was also legendary. Politicians and musicians born there proclaim themselves \u201cCharity Hospital babies.\u201d The staff was so trusted that some people would go nowhere else, even if they landed a job with insurance. But the hospital\u2019s walk-in clinics and emergency rooms became increasingly overloaded, especially in the days before Katrina, as it was hit with repeated state cutbacks. To see specialists, patients often faced year-long waits. It was a system badly in need of reform and, after Katrina, the state shuttered the whole building.\n\nThe city\u2019s handful of existing safety-net clinics first worked with other healthcare providers to see patients from makeshift locations, but they also wanted to rebuild better and provide care that better addressed patients\u2019 needs.\n\nFor instance, doctors found that returning residents not only suffered from physical ailments but also with anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder brought on by the disaster and its aftermath. \u201cSo we did something early that others are very keen to do: we integrated mental healthcare into primary care,\u201d says DeSalvo, noting how \u2013 thanks to more flexible post-disaster funding streams \u2013 each clinic was able to assess patients\u2019 mental health at intake and, if flagged, deliver cognitive behavioral treatment, a type of psychotherapy. Clinic staff found that addressing mental health helped improve physical health, she said. In those early days, under a better-funded holistic model, clinics also added legal-aid lawyers and social workers to their staff, to help people navigate post-Katrina New Orleans.\n\nAt its inception, the clinic network also structured its funding in an unconventional way that incentivized quality care, through criteria that included \u201cmystery-shopper\u201d patients who rated care and ease of access. These incentives, evaluations and expanded care were also made possible because the post-disaster funding that didn\u2019t require typical fee-for-service models. Later, as the clinics shifted to more traditional Medicaid funding and were forced to shed some of the key mental-health and community \u201cextras\u201d that had been part of the network, DeSalvo could feel a change. \u201cIt brought home for me that how you\u2019re paid really matters,\u201d she said.\n\nThis time, saving the clinic network requires both matching funds from a tight Louisiana budget and a federal waiver to allow Medicaid to pay the clinics for patients technically ineligible for Louisiana Medicaid. If that\u2019s okayed, the feds will pay roughly 61 percent of each dollar and the state will have to allocate the remainder from its general fund. The state legislature last week sent Gov. Bobby Jindal a budget that included a clinic allocation of $10 million, which will draw down an additional $16 million in federal money.\n\nThat money will last until June 2015, the end of the state fiscal year.\n\nAfter that, it\u2019s back to crisis.\n\nSign-up for our newsletters Sign Up Daily Weekly", "article_metadata": {"description": "The emergency healthcare that emerged in the wake of the storm has morphed into an innovative model other cities could copy.", "og": {"url": "https://nextcity.org/daily/entry/new-orleans-groundbreaking-post-katrina-healthcare-system", "image": "https://nextcity.org/images/daily/_resized/NolaClinics.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The emergency healthcare that emerged in the wake of the storm has morphed into an innovative model other cities could copy.", "title": "Ice Chests on Sidewalks: New Orleans\u2019 Groundbreaking Post-Katrina Healthcare System"}, "twitter": {"domain": "nextcity.org", "description": "The emergency healthcare that emerged in the wake of the storm has morphed into an innovative model other cities could copy.", "creator": "@NextCityOrg", "image": {"src": "https://nextcity.org/images/daily/_resized/NolaClinics.jpg"}, "title": "Ice Chests on Sidewalks: New Orleans\u2019 Groundbreaking Post-Katrina Healthcare System", "site": "@NextCityOrg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 310796842303514}, "thumbnail": "https://nextcity.org/images/daily/_resized/NolaClinics.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cNew Orleans had some of the lowest rates in primary-care providers \u2013 it used to be at the bottom of the pile.\nSpurred by generous post-disaster funding, 52 neighborhood clinics in four parishes (Louisiana\u2019s term for counties) quickly evolved and have largely replaced a less-efficient pre-Katrina system.\nIt was a system badly in need of reform and, after Katrina, the state shuttered the whole building.\nMoments like these are rare in the field of medicine, which is so often hidebound by payment models and protocol.\nThese incentives, evaluations and expanded care were also made possible because the post-disaster funding that didn\u2019t require typical fee-for-service models."}
