The clinic in Woodbridge doesn\u2019t charge for services and provides acute treatment to patients with chronic ailments.\n\n\u201cThese are the people who don\u2019t even qualify for Obamacare, so we wanted to give back to an organization that is providing care for those who otherwise wouldn\u2019t have access to it,\u201d said Lake Ridge Ambulatory Surgery Center Administrator Janet Smith.\n\nSmith used to volunteer for the free clinic as a registered nurse prior to becoming an administrator for the ambulatory center.\n\nPrince William Area Free Clinic Executive Director Linda Franklin gladly accepted the donation and said funds would come in handy to offset the operating costs of their newer facility off Prince William Parkway on Church Hill Drive, across from Fred M. Lynn Middle School.\n\nThe free clinic has increased the number of its weekly operating hours from 16 to 44 per week since opening their new facility on Church Hill Drive last year. The expansion also means more staff had to be hired to work with patients.\n\nPartnerships with Sentara and NOVA Scripts Central has allowed to clinic to offer low or no cost services like lab work and managed medication distribution to their patients, said Franklin.\n\nThe clinic saw 15,000 patients in 2013 and its volunteers logged 20,000 hours. Some $1 million in services were donated to clinic last year, said Franklin.", "article_metadata": {"shareaholic": {"site_name": "Potomac Local", "language": "en-US", "url": "http://potomaclocal.com/2014/03/18/prince-william-area-free-clinic-accepts-donation/", "article_author_name": "Potomac Local", "image": "http://potomaclocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/031814-free-clinic.png", "site_id": "21d11a6178e95e48c5d3d01ae35422fe", "article_published_time": "2014-03-18T13:53:31+00:00", "shareable_page": "true", "article_modified_time": "2016-05-24T02:30:54+00:00", "keywords": "health, home sub featured, news, prince william, woodbridge local", "wp_version": "7.7.1.0"}, "generator": "NextGEN Gallery Optimizer Basic v2.1.3", "og": {"site_name": "Potomac Local", "description": "WOODBRIDGE, Va. \u2014 The Prince William Area Free Clinic received financial help from a good neighbor.
