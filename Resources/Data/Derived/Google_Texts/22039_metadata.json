BlueCross BlueShield said it would notify Medicaid clients of the withdrawal by the end of August, giving them two months to make the switch.\n\n\u201cIn every one of the six counties, there are other providers that will be able to offer these programs,\u201d said Stephen T. Swift, executive vice president and chief financial officer at BlueCross Blue Shield.\n\nBlueCross BlueShield said it would work to make sure the transition goes smoothly, and state officials agreed.\n\n\u201cThe state Department of Health will work with Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Western NY to ensure a smooth transition as this process moves forward,\u201d the Department of Health, which manages the Medicaid program, said in a statement. \u201cThe department will ensure continuity of high-quality care and no disruption in eligibility for Medicaid members in the region.\u201d\n\nBlueCross BlueShield is the fourth-largest provider of Medicaid managed care in Erie County, with a 19 percent share of the market. Independent Health has the largest share \u2013 29 percent \u2013 while Univera Community Health has 27 percent and New York State Catholic Health Plan has 25 percent.\n\nThe move means those other insurers will have to pick up those former BlueCross BlueShield subscribers \u2013 a move that Rep. Chris Collins, R-Clarence, said could be prohibitively expensive.\n\n\u201cMy fear would be that the other carriers follow suit,\u201d Collins said.\n\nIndependent Health acknowledged that it has faced the same financial pressures in the program as its rival did.\n\n\u201cAs a nonprofit health plan, Independent Health faced similar financial losses to its Medicaid program,\u201d Frank J. Sava, a spokesman for Independent Health, said in a statement. \u201cThese losses were driven by carved-in pharmacy benefits and unique challenges in serving Medicaid beneficiaries in certain counties where there are provider access challenges.\u201d\n\nThe Independent Health statement said nothing, though, about the insurer leaving the Medicaid managed care program. Instead, it said the company is working with state officials to identify new sources of funding that could improve care under the program.\n\nThe Department of Health statement on the issue included no reference to the funding issues that, according to BlueCross BlueShield, drove the insurer out of the Medicaid managed care business.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve struggled with this program over a number of years,\u201d said Swift, who noted that BlueCross BlueShield terminated its Medicaid managed care program in Niagara and Genesee counties last year and its programs in northeastern New York seven years ago. Excellus Blue Cross in Central New York also abandoned the Medicaid managed care program several years ago.\n\nAnd while Obamacare, which took effect last fall, vastly expands the number of New Yorkers on Medicaid, Swift said: \u201cThis really is not driven by the Affordable Care Act.\u201d Over many years, \u201cwe\u2019ve tried many different avenues to remediate the business.\u201d\n\nBut Collins, a consistent critic of Obamacare, said he wasn\u2019t so sure.\n\n\u201cI would argue that BlueCross BlueShield now has a lot more clients on Medicaid because of Obamacare, so they would lose a lot more money,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t see how they could say that this doesn\u2019t have a connection to Obamacare.\u201d\n\nemail: jzremski@buffnews.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Some 53,000 Medicaid recipients in the region, including nearly 29,000 in Erie County, will have to look for new insurance coverage this fall because BlueCross BlueShield of Western New York is withdrawing from the Medicaid managed care program.The insurer, which plans ...", "og": {"site_name": "www.buffaloNews.com", "description": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Some 53,000 Medicaid recipients in the region, including nearly 29,000 in Erie County, will have to look for new insurance coverage this fall because BlueCross BlueShield of Western New York is withdrawing from the Medicaid managed care program.The insurer, which plans ... - The Buffalo News", "title": "BlueCross BlueShield withdraws from Medicaid managed care program  - The Buffalo News", "url": "http://www.buffalonews.com/city-region/medical/bluecross-blueshield-withdraws-from-medicaid-managed-care-program-20140717", "image": "http://www.buffalonews.com/images/BNSocialShareLG.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@TheBuffaloNews", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": "51000084,100004991951001"}, "__sync_contentCategory": "PayWall", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd94ea\"", "article_summary": "Excellus Blue Cross in Central New York also abandoned the Medicaid managed care program several years ago.\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Some 53,000 Medicaid recipients in the region, including nearly 29,000 in Erie County, will have to look for new insurance coverage this fall because BlueCross BlueShield of Western New York is withdrawing from the Medicaid managed care program.\nThe Department of Health statement on the issue included no reference to the funding issues that, according to BlueCross BlueShield, drove the insurer out of the Medicaid managed care business.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve struggled with this program over a number of years,\u201d said Swift, who noted that BlueCross BlueShield terminated its Medicaid managed care program in Niagara and Genesee counties last year and its programs in northeastern New York seven years ago.\n\u201cThe department will ensure continuity of high-quality care and no disruption in eligibility for Medicaid members in the region.\u201dBlueCross BlueShield is the fourth-largest provider of Medicaid managed care in Erie County, with a 19 percent share of the market."}
