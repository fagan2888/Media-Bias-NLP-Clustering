Bush. Also on the list are a former California State University professor who advocates for Palestinian causes and the head of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, a prominent Washington advocacy group.\n\nAll five denied working as foreign agents or terrorists to The Intercept and suggested that their race and religion alone may have singled them out.\n\n\u201cI believe that they tapped me because my name is Asim Abdur Rahman Ghafoor, my parents are from India, I travelled to Saudi Arabia as a young man, and I do the pilgrimage,\u201d Ghafoor, the lawyer, told the outlet.\n\nOther documents seemed to show an anti-Muslim bias at the intelligence agencies.\n\nOne instructional form from 2005, for instance, uses the name \u201cMohammed Raghead\u201d as an example name for a target of surveillance.\n\nCivil rights groups immediately jumped on the new revelations.\n\nThe head of the Center for Constitutional Rights said that the targeting \u201cfits the same pattern\u201d as the FBI\u2019s tracking of top civil rights leaders like Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcom X in previous decades.\n\n\u201cThe government is targeting an organization for its lawful political activity and conflating peaceful support for Palestinians and equal treatment for Muslims in the U.S. with suspicious activity,\u201d Vincent Warrant said.\n\nThe group Muslim Advocates added that the report \u201cconfirms the worst fears of American Muslims: the federal government has targeted Americans, even those who have served their country in the military and government, simply because of their faith or religious heritage.\u201d\n\nPresident Obama and Congress should \u201cimmediately\u201d act to rein in the NSA, the group said.\n\nIn a statement on Wednesday morning, the administration denied that its activities were based on politics or religion.\n\n\u201cIt is entirely false that U.S. intelligence agencies conduct electronic surveillance of political, religious or activist figures solely because they disagree with public policies or criticize the government, or for exercising constitutional rights,\u201d the Justice Department and Office of the Director of National Intelligence said in a joint statement.\n\nAny U.S. citizens or organizations targeted by the government, they note, must first be approved by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.\n\n\u201cNo U.S. person can be the subject of surveillance based solely on First Amendment activities, such as staging public rallies, organizing campaigns, writing critical essays, or expressing personal beliefs,\u201d the agencies added.\n\nCritics have claimed that the secretive spy court effectively acts as a rubber stamp for intelligence agencies.\n\nThe FBI has previously come under hot water for training materials that taught agents to treat all U.S. Muslims as potential terrorists.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Civil rights groups immediately jumped on the new revelations.", "description":
