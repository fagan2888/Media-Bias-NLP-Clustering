In the book, \u201cWho Told You That You Were Naked?\u201d Cochran addressed issues of homosexuality, gay marriage and premarital sex from a biblical perspective.\n\n\u201cMany Christian men struggle with issues of sexual sin and sexuality, and so I spoke to that in the book\u2014why God created sex and that God\u2019s purpose for sex was for procreation, and to do it his way it has to be done in holy matrimony,\u201d Cochran explained. \u201cThat led to the controversy.\u201d\n\nCochran has been a firefighter since 1981 and was appointed Atlanta\u2019s fire chief in 2008. In 2009, President Obama appointed him as U.S. fire administrator for the United States Fire Administration in Washington, D.C. In 2010, he returned to serve as Atlanta\u2019s fire chief.\n\nIn his 34 years of service, Cochran had never been accused of discrimination.\n\nThe controversy with his book began in late 2014, when gay activist groups caught wind of the literature and demanded that Cochran be dismissed.\n\nAtlanta Mayor Kasim Reed then acted to suspend Cochran and ordered him to undergo \u201csensitivity training.\u201d\n\n\u201cI profoundly disagree with and am deeply disturbed by the sentiments expressed in the paperback regarding the LGBT community,\u201d Reed said in a statement. \u201cI will not tolerate discrimination of any kind within my administration.\u201d\n\nIn January, the mayor fired him.\n\n\u201cThis is about judgment,\u201d Reed said in defense of his actions. \u201cThis is not about religious freedom, this is not about free speech \u2026 Judgment is the basis of the problem.\u201d\n\nCochran told The Daily Signal that he does not judge anyone.\n\n\u201cMy profession for 34 years was to be willing to die for anyone under any condition where I could possibly save a life, and I am still committed to doing that today,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no hatred. Love is the foundation of the Christian faith and I have lived that out in my profession for 34 years.\u201d\n\nUpon being fired, Cochran filed his own federal lawsuit against the city of Atlanta, alleging that he was wrongfully terminated and being discriminated against for his Christian beliefs.\n\n\u201cIn the United States of America, we are guaranteed the freedom to live without fear of being terminated or experiencing any adverse action for the free expression of our beliefs and thoughts,\u201d Cochran said. \u201cIt was an injustice against me on that basis.\u201d\n\nThe case is still ongoing.\n\nHis lawyer, David Cortman, who serves as senior counsel and vice president of litigation with Alliance Defending Freedom, said the lawsuit has national implications \u201cfor several reasons.\u201d\n\n\u201cFirst off, do we want the government deciding that anyone that holds views that are in conflict with the government\u2019s views can\u2019t work\u2014can\u2019t make a living?\u201d Cortman asked.\n\nHe continued:\n\nThat should worry all of us regardless of your religious viewpoints, your ideological viewpoints, your political viewpoints. It should not matter your viewpoints to hold a job. The second thing that should worry everyone is, we have a right to religious freedom to free exercise in the Constitution and that gives a person the right to say look, I don\u2019t have to choose between my faith and making a living. But that\u2019s exactly the choice that the city put on Chief Cochran.\n\nCochran maintains that \u201ctolerance is a two-way street.\u201d\n\nHe believes Reed showed \u201czero tolerance\u201d by firing Cochran for expressing his beliefs.\n\n\u201cPeople of any faith, when they\u2019re strong in their faith, they would choose to live out their faith over keeping their job,\u201d Cochran said. \u201cBut that should not even be a dilemma for any American in this country.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "\u201cIn the United States, Americans should not have to choose between keeping your job and living out your faith,\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "\u201cIn the United States, Americans should not have to choose between keeping your job and living out your faith,\u201d", "title": "Atlanta Fire Chief Fired \u2018Absolutely\u2019 Wants His Job Back", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/Cochran_Obama_Cover.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-07-10T13:51:39+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1Iw3f9K"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "\u201cIn the United States, Americans should not have to choose between keeping your job and living out your faith,\u201d", "title": "Atlanta Fire Chief Fired \u2018Absolutely\u2019 Wants His Job Back", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/Cochran_Obama_Cover.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "religious liberty", "published_time": "2015-07-06T03:01:45+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-10T13:51:39+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "gay marriage, religious liberty, fire chief fired, Kelvin Cochran, same-sex marriage, lgbt"}, "article_summary": "After being fired for writing what\u2019s been described as an \u201canti-gay\u201d book, former Atlanta Fire Chief Kelvin Cochran says he \u201cabsolutely\u201d wants his job back.\n\u201cPeople of any faith, when they\u2019re strong in their faith, they would choose to live out their faith over keeping their job,\u201d Cochran said.\n\u201cIn the United States of America, Americans should not have to choose between keeping your job and living out your faith,\u201d Cochran told The Daily Signal in an exclusive interview.\nHe continued:That should worry all of us regardless of your religious viewpoints, your ideological viewpoints, your political viewpoints.\n\u201cThat led to the controversy.\u201dCochran has been a firefighter since 1981 and was appointed Atlanta\u2019s fire chief in 2008."}
