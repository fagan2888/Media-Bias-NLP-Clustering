Soda. However you call it, the beverage can mean big trouble, according to a revised estimate of a 2013 study on the negative impact of sugary drinks.\n\nWorldwide, sugary drinks are responsible for 184,000 deaths each year, with 25,000 of those deaths in America, according to the study published in the journal Circulation. This is larger than the estimate two years ago of 180,000 deaths in the same time frame. Researchers counted deaths from diabetes, heart disease, and cancer that are linked to sweetened soda, fruit drink, sports/energy drink, and iced tea consumption. The researchers found 133,000 annual deaths happen at the hands of type 2 diabetes, 45,000 deaths are due to cardiovascular disease, and 6,450 deaths are linked to cancer.\n\nDr. Dariush Mozaffarian, senior author of the study and dean of Tufts University\u2019s Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy, told Live Science that this means people ought to consume less sugary beverages. Though not all humans have access to healthy foods, lowering one\u2019s sugary drink intake can make a difference.\n\n\u201cMany countries in the world have a significant number of deaths occurring from a single dietary factor, sugar-sweetened beverages,\u201d Dr. Mozaffarian said. \u201cIt should be a global priority to substantially reduce or eliminate sugar-sweetened beverages from the diet. Some population dietary changes, such as increasing fruits and vegetables, can be challenging due to agriculture, costs, storage, and other complexities. This is not complicated. There are no health benefits from sugar-sweetened beverages, and the potential impact of reducing consumption is saving tens of thousands of deaths each year.\u201d\n\nStudy lead Gitanjali Singh added that the U.S. in particular sees a significant number of deaths by sugary drinks each year.\n\n\u201cAmong the 20 countries with the highest estimated sugar-sweetened beverage-related deaths, at least eight were in Latin America and the Caribbean, reflecting the high intakes in that region of the world,\u201d Singh said.\n\nWhen the American Beverage Association said in a statement that the research \u201cdoes not show that consuming sugar-sweetened beverages causes chronic diseases and the authors themselves acknowledge that they are at best estimating effects of sugar-sweetened beverage consumption,\u201d Mozaffarian explained to the publication that obesity and sugary drinks are very much related. As ATTN: wrote earlier this year, the CDC finds sugary drinks are connected to poor dental health and obesity, among many other risks. Two years ago, General Dentistry found that years of diet soda drinking does similar damage to one\u2019s teeth as years of meth or cocaine smoking. The acid wears down a person\u2019s enamel and consequently increases that individual\u2019s chances of getting cavities, developing cracks, discoloring, and sensitivity.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A chilling new Circulation study reveals just how dangerous our daily habit has become VIDEO", "title": "Sugar is literally killing us: The stunning fatality rates behind our soda addiction", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "A chilling new Circulation study reveals just how dangerous our daily habit has become VIDEO", "title": "Sugar is literally killing us: The stunning fatality rates behind our soda addiction", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/07/05/heres_how_many_deaths_sugary_drinks_cause_each_year_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/07/shutterstock_169952210.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A chilling new Circulation study reveals just how dangerous our daily habit has become VIDEO", "title": "Sugar is literally killing us: The stunning fatality rates behind our soda addiction", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/07/shutterstock_169952210.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "LAURA DONOVAN", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Attn:, beverage industry, Coca-Cola, pepsi, Soda, Sugar", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd13c1\"", "article_summary": "Though not all humans have access to healthy foods, lowering one\u2019s sugary drink intake can make a difference.\nAs ATTN: wrote earlier this year, the CDC finds sugary drinks are connected to poor dental health and obesity, among many other risks.\n\u201cIt should be a global priority to substantially reduce or eliminate sugar-sweetened beverages from the diet.\nResearchers counted deaths from diabetes, heart disease, and cancer that are linked to sweetened soda, fruit drink, sports/energy drink, and iced tea consumption.\n\u201cMany countries in the world have a significant number of deaths occurring from a single dietary factor, sugar-sweetened beverages,\u201d Dr. Mozaffarian said."}
