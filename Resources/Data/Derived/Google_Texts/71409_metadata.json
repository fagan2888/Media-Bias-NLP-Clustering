That\u2019s because too few insurance companies are participating in places with sparse populations, a cost analysis by the New York Times says.\n\n\u201cIndividuals and families that can actually purchase health insurance on the glitch-filled HealthCare.gov website are going to be in for a rude awakening when they find out their premiums will skyrocket,\u201d said Brett Healy, president of Wisconsin\u2019s MacIver Institute. \u201cRates are expected to double in parts of Wisconsin, which serves as further proof that the Affordable Care Act is anything but affordable.\u201d\n\nWisconsin will experience the nation\u2019s 10th highest premium rate hike under Obamacare, according to a report released this week by Forbes and the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research.\n\nThe only other states that face larger increases are Nevada (179 percent), New Mexico (142 percent), Arkansas (138 percent), North Carolina (136 percent), Vermont (117 percent), Georgia (92 percent), South Dakota (77 percent), Nebraska (74 percent) and Iowa (72 percent).\n\nWisconsin and Delaware are tied for 10th at 69 percent.\n\nOnly eight states are projected to actually benefit from premium decreases, and that\u2019s because a majority of them already had heavily regulated individual insurance markets prior to Obamacare, the study shows.\n\nMost Badger State residents are not going to be that fortunate.\n\nA 27-year-old Wisconsin man will be hit with a premium rate hike of 125 percent, and a woman the same age will pay 78 percent more for health insurance on the individual market, according to the report.\n\nA 40-year-old Wisconsin man will be charged an additional 73 percent and a 40-year-woman will see an increase of 31 percent.\n\nSixty-four-year-old Wisconsin men and women will encounter rises of 38 and 68 percent, respectively.\n\nThe fact that a majority of Wisconsinites will be paying more for health insurance under Obamacare does not surprise Yevgeniy Feyman, a fellow at the Manhattan Institute\u2019s Center for Medical Progress.\n\nFeyman points to the underlying regulations in the Affordable Care Act as one of the main factors in the escalating insurance costs.\n\nGuaranteed issue, for example, requires policies to be offered to any eligible candidate without regard to health status, Feyman said.\n\nBut those patients cannot be charged more than someone who doesn\u2019t have a pre-existing condition, which drives up the price for everyone, Feyman added.\n\nCosts are also ascending under Obamacare because the number of required benefits in health plans has grown larger, according to Dave Jensen, editorial director at HCTrends, a health care research organization based in Wisconsin.\n\n\u201cMen, for instance, on an individual policy, like for me, I have to have maternity coverage \u2026 They become richer benefits \u2013 basically is what it is \u2013 and if you have richer benefits, you have to have a richer premium,\u201d Jensen said.\n\nBut even though a large number of Wisconsinites will be paying more out of their pockets for health insurance, they might not get the same access to care because of the ACA.\n\nThe state has a shortage of more than 105 primary medical care physicians and close to 200 mental health doctors, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Services.\n\nSome are predicting that Obamacare will add to that scarcity.\n\nDr. Jane Orient, executive director of the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, said doctor shortages will be exacerbated under the ACA because many of the uninsured are being shoved onto Medicaid.\n\n\u201cDoctors are increasingly unwilling to take Medicaid,\u201d Orient said. \u201cIt is a huge expense, a huge hassle, and the payment doesn\u2019t cover the cost of providing the service.\u201d\n\nSome physicians also are considering other options because of Obamacare\u2019s stricter regulations, some of which deal with cumbersome data reporting, Orient said.\n\n\u201cI think if doctors do all that stuff, they won\u2019t have any time to take care of sick people,\u201d Orient said. \u201cIt drives a lot of them nuts, so many doctors are just saying, \u2018Well, we\u2019re going to quit or we\u2019re going to try to escape into a fully direct pay, cash-based practice.\u201d\u2019\n\nDemand also is expected to go up because the average number of people with health insurance should increase every year for the foreseeable future, Feyman said.\n\nFeyman also anticipates a demographic shift in the next several decades that will result in an older population that is more inclined to need medical assistance on a more regular basis.\n\nOthers also are convinced that those who have been uninsured for years and get insurance will seek a significant amount of health care resources right off the bat.\n\n\u201cIf it turns out that the people who get insured in the first and second year are less healthy, it\u2019s very possible that they are going to put a heavier strain on the physician workforce,\u201d Feyman said.\n\nAn estimated 100 additional new physicians are needed in the state each year to keep up with health care demands, according to a report released in 2011 by the Wisconsin Hospital Association.\n\nIf those 100 doctors are not added each year, the state\u2019s economy will be $5 billion less than what it could be by 2030, the study claims.\n\nProjections show that Wisconsin could have a shortfall of more than 2,000 physicians by 2030, WHA officials say.\n\nContact Adam Tobias at atobias@watchdog.org or follow him
