Hundreds of dog owners and their furry friends gathered Saturday in Springfield for Responsible Dog Ownership Day.

The annual event was held at the Greater Panama City Dog Fanciers Association's Clubhouse on West 11th street.

NewsChannel 7's Neysa Wilkins sang the national anthem and Carly Hildyard emceed the event.

There were several vendors at the clubhouse giving information on vaccinations, microchipping, spaying and neutering.

And some of the dogs were even able to show off their best moves in agility and fly-ball demonstrations.

"Every year it gets bigger and bigger because the word gets out and more events come about," said Peggy Wilson, a Board Member for the Greater Panama City Dog Fancier's Association. "We have so many different things such as obedience, agility, fly-ball. And now that the AKC recognizes mixed breeds, it's open to everybody and everyone in the community can come have fun and enjoy everything that our dog club has to offer."
