That will increase the amount of necessary capital investment and lead to higher energy production costs.\u201d\n\nNickels added: \u201cThis second analysis does not alter our earlier conclusion that additional infrastructure \u2013 and time \u2013 is needed to meet the (EPA\u2019s) proposed carbon emission goals. It takes time to develop a stable, secure, efficient and effective bulk electric power system necessary to support changes of the magnitude being proposed by the CPP.\u201d\n\nSPP, which has over 570 employees, is one of the nation\u2019s 12 regional transmission organizations (RTOs) that independently operate the nation\u2019s electric energy grid. Currently, SPP ensures that power gets to consumers safely and reliably across parts of eight states, including Arkansas, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Nebraska, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas.\n\nPRESSURE BUILDS AS EPA PLANS TO ADOPT NEW RULES IN JUNE\n\nSouthwest\u2019s analysis of estimated costs to comply with the president\u2019s controversial carbon emission plans comes while state regulators, energy stakeholders, business lobbies, environmental groups and politicians are ratcheting up pressure on the EPA ahead of the federal agency\u2019s self-imposed June 1 deadline to adopt the proposed carbon emission rules.\n\nGov. Asa Hutchinson has questioned the legality of so-called rule 111(d), saying that the Obama administration\u2019s environmental mandate will drive up power costs across the state, reduce jobs and lower the standard of living for most Arkansans.\n\n\u201cThis means that additional mandates \u2026 that close coal powered plants or increase the cost of generating power from coal will cause an increase in costs to Arkansas\u2019s residents and manufacturers,\u201d Hutchinson argued in his letter to EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy on Dec. 1. \u201cSuch increases will negatively affect the economic growth and well-being of Arkansans.\u201d\n\nMore recently, Federal Energy Regulatory Commissioner Colette Honorable warned Arkansas regulators during an appearance in Little Rock in late March that they should not get \u201ccaught flat-footed\u201d by waiting until the EPA adopts proposed greenhouse gas rules before making plans on how to clean up carbon emissions from the state\u2019s coal-fired power plants.\n\n\u201cThis (EPA) rule will come out this summer, and I know Arkansas has certainly joined the litigation effort as there has been several other states who have, but my point has been this \u2026 that (legal) tract can move along and it will, but we are not harmed and we are better served if we engage in this effort now,\u201d said the former Arkansas Public Service Commission (PSC) chairwoman.\n\nLast week, ADEQ Director Becky Keogh told Talk Business & Politics that she fully expects the EPA to adopt proposed guidelines in June, although she was uncertain what those rules would look like.\n\n\u201cWe fully expect the EPA to move forward with final plans sometime in the mid-summer,\u201d Keogh said in an interview. \u201cWe are looking at what that means for Arkansas. We are in conversations (or debate) about what Arkansas actions should take \u2013 in terms of developing a state plan or watching to see what the final rule will say.\u201d\n\nKeogh said she believes that comments submitted to the EPA by Arkansas stakeholder groups will be taken into consideration in the final rules. \u201cWe believe those comments are being listened too, and anticipate there will be some changes,\u201d Keogh said. \u201cRight now, as an agency, we are trying to evaluate what\u2019s the best route forward and really understand what is being asked of the state \u2026 to make sure we have factored in both environmental and economic development (considerations).\u201d\n\nAlso, when SPP rival Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) announced the grand-opening of its new $22 million regional command center in West Little Rock on March 24, CEO John Bear said the regional grid operator will remain neutral concerning the ongoing EPA debate on the stringent \u201cdirty air\u201d rules, despite the fact the costs to comply with the president\u2019s mandate could reach as high as $90 billion over 20 years.\n\nLike SPP, MISO has conducted an internal analysis that estimates potential costs to comply with the EPA order will top about $3 billion annually to cut carbon emissions at existing power plants in the grid operator\u2019s 15-state footprint across the U.S.\n\n\u201cOur view is that the rules are going to be what the rules are going to be,\u201d Bear said. \u201cWe are going to figure out the most efficient and reliable way to implement it, whatever it comes out to be.\u201d\n\nSPP spokesman Tom Kleckner said the Little Rock grid operator is currently conducting a third study, which will look at state-by-state costs to comply with the EPA\u2019s carbon emission rules. To date, Arkansas regulators and stakeholders have not decided whether to submit a regional or state compliance plan to the EPA.\n\nAccording to the EPA, states will have a year after the final rules are adopted in June to create their own long-term strategies to reduce emissions, whether through cutting coal consumption, increasing renewable energy, or implementing a cap-and-trade program. Similar to the Affordable Care Act, if states don\u2019t make a plan of their own, then the federal government would step in and create one for them.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Local & Regional News", "description": "Grid operator Southwest Power Pool (SPP) said Wednesday that it would cost up to $2.9 billion a year to develop a regional plan to comply with President", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://ualrpublicradio.org/post/southwest-power-pool-29-billion-annual-price-tag-comply-epa-dirty-air-rules", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/kuar/files/styles/medium/public/201504/southwest_power_pool_logo.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Grid operator Southwest Power Pool (SPP) said Wednesday that it would cost up to $2.9 billion a year to develop a regional plan to comply with President", "title": "Southwest Power Pool: $2.9 Billion Annual Price Tag to Comply With EPA \u2018Dirty Air\u2019 Rules"}, "wordCount": 1291, "twitter": {"site": "@kuarpublicradio", "card": "summary"}, "author": "Wesley Brown/ Talk Business &amp; Politics", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Southwest Power Pool: $2.9 Billion Annual Price Tag to Comply With EPA \u2018Dirty Air\u2019 Rules"}, "nid": 39716, "datePublished": "2015-04-09", "story_id": 398550170, "keywords": "Arkansas Environment", "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0f18\"", "article_summary": "\u201cRegional compliance with the (Clean Power Plan) by 2030 is possible, and is likely to be less costly than state-by-state compliance,\u201d said Lanny Nickell, vice president of engineering for SPP.\nTo date, Arkansas regulators and stakeholders have not decided whether to submit a regional or state compliance plan to the EPA.\nSPP\u2019s analysis, which is the second such study by the regional power grid operator, also indicates up to 13,900 megawatts of coal-fired production would likely have to be taken offline, which goes beyond SPP\u2019s current transmission-planning assumptions for power generation across eight different states.\nGrid operator Southwest Power Pool (SPP) said Wednesday that it would cost up to $2.9 billion a year to develop a regional plan to comply with President Obama\u2019s proposed Clean Power Plan (CPP) that the federal Environmental Protection Agency is expected to hand down later this summer.\nAsa Hutchinson has questioned the legality of so-called rule 111(d), saying that the Obama administration\u2019s environmental mandate will drive up power costs across the state, reduce jobs and lower the standard of living for most Arkansans."}
