The study described the workers as a \u201cvulnerable population\u201d with median incomes of $14,333 among individuals and $29,126 among families.\n\nNine out of 10 of those workers do not have a college degree, and 600,000 of them work in the retail industry, 225,000 in education and nearly 590,000 in restaurants, according to the study.\n\nLanhee J. Chen, a Hoover fellow and adviser on GOP nominee Mitt Romney\u2019s campaign for president in 2012, outlined the study\u2019s findings in hearing before the House Ways and Means Committee.\n\nThe hearing delved into the controversial \u201cemployer mandate\u201d tied to the Affordable Care Act, which requires firms with 50 or more full-time workers to provide health coverage or pay fines.\n\nThe Obama administration delayed the mandate\u2019s implementation by one year, to 2015, but lawmakers from both parties are concerned about its potential effect on the workforce, particularly its use of a 30-hour work week instead of the more traditional 40-hour threshold.\n\nGOP leaders on the Ways and Means Committee said the 30-hour cutoff provides a perverse incentive for companies to make sure part-time employees work less than 30 hours, so they do not have to pay for expensive health coverage.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A new study says 2.6 million part-time workers with relatively low incomes could have their hours or pay cut because an Obamacare mandate defines a full-time work week as 30 hours of labor.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "A new study says 2.6 million part-time workers with relatively low incomes could have their hours or pay cut because an Obamacare mandate defines a full-time work week as 30 hours of labor.", "title": "Obamacare mandate jeopardizes hours, pay for millions of part-timers: Study", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jan/28/study-millions-workers-hours-pay-cut-obamacare/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/12/28/obamas-yearjpeg-0fbe6.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/12/28/obamas-yearjpeg-0fbe6.jpg", "description": "A new study says 2.6 million part-time workers with relatively low incomes could have their hours or pay cut because an Obamacare mandate defines a full-time work week as 30 hours of labor.", "card": "summary", "title": "Obamacare mandate jeopardizes hours, pay for millions of part-timers:"}, "Author": "Tom Howell Jr.", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Labor, Social Issues"}, "article_summary": "A new study says 2.6 million part-time workers with relatively low incomes could have their hours or pay cut because an Obamacare mandate defines a full-time work week as 30 hours of labor.\nThe study described the workers as a \u201cvulnerable population\u201d with median incomes of $14,333 among individuals and $29,126 among families.\nThe hearing delved into the controversial \u201cemployer mandate\u201d tied to the Affordable Care Act, which requires firms with 50 or more full-time workers to provide health coverage or pay fines.\nThe Obama administration delayed the mandate\u2019s implementation by one year, to 2015, but lawmakers from both parties are concerned about its potential effect on the workforce, particularly its use of a 30-hour work week instead of the more traditional 40-hour threshold.\nGOP leaders on the Ways and Means Committee said the 30-hour cutoff provides a perverse incentive for companies to make sure part-time employees work less than 30 hours, so they do not have to pay for expensive health coverage."}
