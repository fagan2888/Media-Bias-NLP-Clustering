The new members of their team, former Oracle executive Steve Brugman and former Hospital Corporation of America executive Robert England sat beside Valdez.\n\nFor Valdez and Ryon, 30, they say a unique set of circumstances led them to put a camera on a remote-controlled helicopter when few others were doing it.\n\n\u201cIt just made sense\u201d\n\nBrugman, now Snap-roll\u2019s CEO, recalls pulling out a notebook during the first meeting he and England had with Valdez and Ryon and asking them to go over who they had worked for in the past. He said that by the time they finished, he had filled the page with a who\u2019s who list of production companies.\n\n\u201cI was shocked at what these two young men had accomplished in so little time, and at the progression of it,\u201d he said.\n\nBrugman and England were not long ago the new owners of a struggling internet service provider in Nashville, the Nexus Group, where they partnered, remodeled and sold the company to a private equity firm in October 2014.\n\nThey heard about the \u201ctwo young men they should know about\u201d through an accountant in Franklin, and a meeting was arranged in January 2015, where the two founders shared their story.\n\nValdez and Ryon met at a Lewisburg, Tenn., airport in 2006 and hit it off. For the next three years, they bonded over flying.\n\nToward the end of that period, Valdez had taken on a photo hobby that earned him extra cash and toyed with remote-controlled helicopters on the side.\n\n\u201cI was taking RC helicopters and building camera mounts for them,\u201d he said. \u201cI was taking video and working on it to make it smoother and more stable.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Ryon was a corporate pilot and project manager for a development company. He was taking pictures from the air for developers while he flew over their sites in a full-sized helicopter. When he compared the images he captured with those Valdez took, Ryon said saw an opportunity.\n\n\u201cI realized the cost difference for him to put a camera on a drone,\u201d Ryon said. \u201cI saw that we could do the same thing with a 10-pound helicopter. We could get crowds, do shots of buildings. That was key for me.\u201d\n\nIn 2009, they started Snaproll Media LLC.\n\nThe gigs came in mainly by word of mouth.\n\nFirst they were doing real estate, then low-budget music videos, then bigger names \u2014 Rodney Atkins, Josh Thompson, Taylor Swift, Tim McGraw.\n\nAs the jobs got bigger and the equipment fancier, so did the warehouse. Valdez purchased welding equipment and remodeled the drones and camera mounts for more stability.\n\nBy the time they had started flying with $20,000 worth of cameras on board, they were in a league of their own.\n\n\u201cWe started realizing, \u2018We\u2019re the only ones doing this,\u2019 \u201d Ryon said. \u201cThere were maybe two or three other companies flying cameras for a while.\u201d\n\nThis led to four years of globetrotting for Valdez and Ryon, jumping from continent to continent for high-profile productions.\n\n\u201cThey had this kind of courage to stand up to immense pressure, and I think they had youth to thank for that,\u201d Brugman said.\n\nEngland agreed.\n\nHe recounted that one of their first major productions for a country music video, they flew a $20,000 camera over a lake for an aerial shot of the boat.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think they even knew if the camera was insured,\u201d said England, a business partner in Snaproll. \u201cThat\u2019s more of a risk than I would have taken.\u201d\n\nThe FAA and a changing world\n\nIn the years since the advent of affordable drone technology, the do\u2019s and don\u2019ts of personal and commercial use has been a veritable mine field for the Department of Transportation administration tasked with policing the skies.\n\nStories of drones interfering with law enforcement investigations, crossing paths with police helicopters or other aircraft and invading privacy have become more common. In Southern California, for instance, drones have flown over wildfires and interfered with air tankers battling the blazes. There\u2019s even a $75,000 reward in one county for information on who was behind the drone flights.\n\nBut drones offer a compelling alternative for many dangerous jobs.\n\nBrugman said that even in the film industry, Snaproll has replaced cranes as much as helicopters.\n\n\u201cWhen you think about how you have to risk human life to do some of these jobs, it\u2019s hard not to see they are the way to go,\u201d he said.\n\nIn February 2015, the FAA proposed a framework that would allow certain small unmanned aircraft to fly legally, for both personal and commercial uses. The restrictions for personal use were lax and said basically don\u2019t fly over people, into restricted airspace or in areas that may be hazardous.\n\nFor those wishing to make money flying drones, the bar is higher. The rules require a pilot-in-command to possess a private pilot certificate and have logged 25 hours flying drones. The rules also mandate an additional visual observer.\n\nIn June, FAA Deputy Administrator Michael Whitaker said new rules would likely be finalized in the next year that would open drone use to a broad spectrum of companies, so long as regulations are followed.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://tnne.ws/1SvQbaG", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "The collective buzz of the octocopter\u2019s tiny rotors was about as loud as a lawn mower.", "og": {"site_name": "The Tennessean", "description": "The collective buzz of the octocopter\u2019s tiny rotors was about as loud as a lawn mower.", "title": "Franklin startup at heart of drone industry\u2019s cutting edge", "url": "http://www.tennessean.com/story/news/2015/08/01/franklin-startup-heart-drone-industrys-cutting-edge/30912757/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/tennessean.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The collective buzz of the octocopter\u2019s tiny rotors was about as loud as a lawn mower.", "title": "Franklin startup at heart of drone industry\u2019s cutting edge", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6b5c4772f5f722050f9c512a7865118a37436cf8/c=252-0-2631-2379&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/08/01/Nashville/B9318002962Z.1_20150801171139_000_GFFBFPEUG.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@tennessean", "site": "@tennessean", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600028886", "fb": {"app_id": 121487414583460}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Companies/Amazon", "gci-asset-type": "data", "gci-categories": "Companies/Amazon", "title": "Franklin startup at heart of drone industry\u2019s cutting edge", "author": "Jordan Buie", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "news", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c9deb5bf80fb9a761208302f3b5944f56579706c/c=1394-0-3178-2379/local/-/media/2015/08/01/Nashville/B9318002962Z.1_20150801171139_000_GFFBFPEUG.1-0.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/508168c08870206f87764d2d4e4b165d60fe77db/c=252-0-2631-2379/local/-/media/2015/08/01/Nashville/B9318002962Z.1_20150801171139_000_GFFBFPEUG.1-0.jpg", "contenttype": "data", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/7f36c60c74ea56684a14230758f79bb66ca003a9/c=324-0-3488-2379/local/-/media/2015/08/01/Nashville/B9318002962Z.1_20150801171139_000_GFFBFPEUG.1-0.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/8e7b0ba2e0d0d10556f371a565adde527e27730c/c=0-163-3922-2379&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/2015/08/01/Nashville/B9318002962Z.1_20150801171139_000_GFFBFPEUG.1-0.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-08-02T07:02:28.853000-05:00", "shorthed": "Franklin startup at heart of drone industry\u2019s cutting edge", "articleid": 30912757, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f96f14cef0a37a019913468afbe75f2ffea1b2f4/c=0-163-3922-2379/local/-/media/2015/08/01/Nashville/B9318002962Z.1_20150801171139_000_GFFBFPEUG.1-0.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2009a8eaf076d5add371c99538ca8591c71d954e/c=1544-0-2876-2379/local/-/media/2015/08/01/Nashville/B9318002962Z.1_20150801171139_000_GFFBFPEUG.1-0.jpg"}}, "news_keywords": "Drones, Franklin, Williamson County, Snaproll Media, FAA, Nexus Group, Oracle"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe12c8\"", "article_summary": "The rules require a pilot-in-command to possess a private pilot certificate and have logged 25 hours flying drones.\n\u201cI realized the cost difference for him to put a camera on a drone,\u201d Ryon said.\nFor those wishing to make money flying drones, the bar is higher.\nBuy Photo SnapRoll Media co-founder and pilot Spencer Valdez demonstrates flying an unmanned aerial vehicle outside the company's headquarters in Franklin on July 11, 2015.\nJust before the demonstration in Franklin, Valdez reclined on a sofa in an unassuming warehouse on Mallory Station Road and discussed the future."}
