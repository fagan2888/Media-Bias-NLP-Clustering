Their actions are not necessarily criminal; creating an offshore shell company is legal, and anyone with an Internet connection and a few thousand dollars can do it. But Mossack Fonseca, the Panama-based law firm where the documents originated, and others like it provide the expertise that allows their clients to stay just on the right side of the law.\n\nMitigating the Migration Crisis: European officials released new proposals that would ease some of the burden on Greece and Italy, the countries under the most strain by the influx of migrants and refugees from the Middle East, Africa, and elsewhere. Europe\u2019s refugee policy has been in tatters since rates of migration soared last summer, and disagreement among European Union member states has hampered attempts at any large-scale regulations.\n\nHello, Wisconsin: Ted Cruz and Bernie Sanders prevailed in the Wisconsin primaries last night, but they still trail Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton in the number of delegates required to secure the presidential nomination for their parties. Meanwhile, it\u2019s not too late for anti-Trump Republicans\u2014or Trump himself, should he lose the nomination\u2014to launch a serious third-party run.\n\nSnapshot\n\nQuoted\n\n\u201cIf it turns out that what you really have to do is go to college and make sure your roommate is the next Mark Zuckerberg in order to get ahead \u2026 that doesn\u2019t work.\u201d \u2014Kevin Leicht, a sociologist\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a groundbreaking work, but Freudenthal\u2019s book is the most boring I have ever read. Logarithm tables are cool compared to it.\u201d \u2014Yvan Dutil, an astrophysicist, on a 1960 book about communicating with extraterrestrials\n\n\u201cIf you want to incorporate, fine. You pay the fee. Nevada doesn\u2019t investigate, so why should I?\u201d \u2014Robert Harris, a Nevadan who helps people avoid taxes\n\nEvening Read\n\nYoni Applebaum on the Andrew Jackson supporters who, over a century ago, set the pattern for Donald Trump\u2019s success:\n\n\u201cBorderers\u201d\u2014who hailed from northern Ireland, Scotland, and northern England\u2014brought with them a distinctive culture. The constant conflict, insecurity, and poverty of the borderlands led their inhabitants to stress sharply differentiated gender roles, to prize aggressiveness, and to disdain weakness. Strong familial loyalty was matched with a clannish suspicion of outsiders. The settlers took these attitudes with them to Appalachia, [historian David Hackett Fischer] argued, where they were reinforced, and in some measure altered, by harsh conditions along the frontier. \u2026 Borderers adhered to a distinctive conception of natural liberty, which put the individual\u2019s right to pursue his private interests at its core. \u2026 Politicians won support from Borderers by promising to make their nation great again\u2014and to make it theirs. They stood within a distinctive cultural tradition\u2014one that shaped their appeal within one region of the country, even as it limited its reach. And any of these descriptions of their style could be applied, with no changes whatsoever, to the current Republican frontrunner. Donald Trump is their direct heir.\n\nContinue reading here.\n\nNews Quiz\n\n1.

One, who chose not to be baptized, writes:\n\nOnly if you are baptized can you be disfellowshipped. Baptism is not a requirement in the church nor is it a choice one can frivolously make. \u2026 For one to act as though they were shocked by their disfellowshipping and the subsequent behavior of baptized family and friends is like one being surprised that their spouse has divorced them and doesn\u2019t wish to communicate after cheating. They chose to make a lifelong vow and broke it, fully aware of the potential consequences. No one forced them to be baptized; it was their own free will and choice. Again, without that choice, they would not have been in a position to be disfellowshipped in the first place.\n\nBut another reader, who was baptized at 14, objects:\n\nShe presumes that the commitment to baptism is a free one, and that the consequences of breaking the commitment are thus chosen. \u2026 What if your experience of the world is completely filtered through Watchtower-shaped lenses? \u2026 I wanted to fit in, please my parents, and do what I thought would save me. I was bright, highly adept at acting as though I believed everything I ought to\u2014so adept that I fooled not only the elders and my parents, but myself. I\u2019ve been \u201cinactive\u201d for over a decade, and the reason I\u2019m not disfellowshipped is because I refuse to subject myself to the \u201cjudicial\u201d procedures your reader describes. If I were to become disfellowshipped, I know that my parents and brother would probably stop talking to me, and my mother has said as much. So, I remain in a limbo, which I don\u2019t mind at all, considering that I think the entire process is abused and abusive.\n\nContinue reading here.\n\nVerbs\n\nCairo psychiatrists threatened, country music\u2019s outlaw hero remembered, Polish anti-abortion law protested, lead-exposure risk mapped, law school renamed, FIFA ethics expert resigned, wine wars waged.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Panama Papers buzz continued, Europe grappled with its migration crisis, the U.S. presidential front-runners tripped, and more.", "author": "Marina Koren and Rosa Inocencio Smith", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "The Panama Papers buzz continued, Europe grappled with its migration crisis, the U.S. presidential front-runners tripped, and more.", "title": "The Atlantic Daily: Panamania, Refugee Rules, Cruz and Sanders", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2016/04/RTSDV5Z/facebook.jpg?1459976175", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/personal/archive/2016/04/the-atlantic-daily-panama-papers-refugees-cruz-sanders/477189/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "Hello, Wisconsin: Ted Cruz and Bernie Sanders prevailed in the Wisconsin primaries last night, but they still trail Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton in the number of delegates required to secure the presidential nomination for their parties.\nDonald Trump is their direct heir.\nAn American company scrapped its $160 billion merger with an __________ company because of new U.S. tax rules.\nMeanwhile, it\u2019s not too late for anti-Trump Republicans\u2014or Trump himself, should he lose the nomination\u2014to launch a serious third-party run.\nThis article is part of a feature we also send out via email as The Atlantic Daily , a newsletter with stories, ideas, and images from The Atlantic , written specially for subscribers."}
