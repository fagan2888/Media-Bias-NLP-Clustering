It flourishes in our White House. Thomas Jefferson, our third president, tried to pass term limits, but failed in the face of those who love power and expect to maintain it.\n\nJudicial Watch, the public interest group that investigates and prosecutes government corruption, released its 2013 list of Washington's \"Ten Most Wanted Corrupt Politicians.\" www.JudicialWatch.org, the list, in alphabetical order, includes:\n\n\u2022 Speaker of the House John Boehner (R-OH)\n\n\u2022 CIA Director John Brennan\n\n\u2022 Senator Saxby Chambliss\n\n\u2022 Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton\n\n\u2022 Attorney General Eric Holder\n\n\u2022 Former IRS Commissioner Steven T. Miller / Former IRS Official Lois Lerner\n\n\u2022 Former DHS Secretary Janet Napolitano\n\n\u2022 President Barack Obama\n\n\u2022 Senator Harry Reid (D-NV)\n\n\u2022 Health Secretary Kathleen Sebelius\n\nDishonorable Mentions for 2013 include:\n\n\u2022 Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg\n\n\u2022 Outgoing Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell (R) / Incoming Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D)\n\n\u2022 Former Rep. Rick Renzi (R-AZ)\n\n\u2022 National Security Adviser Susan Rice\n\nAs a 27 year old staff attorney for the House Judiciary Committee, Ms. Hillary Clinton suffered firing by her supervisor, lifelong democrat Jerry Zeifman who said, \u201cShe is a liar. She was unethical and dishonest. She conspired to violate the Constitution, the rules of the House, the rules of the committee and the rules of confidentiality.\u201d\n\nIf you remember the murders at the U.S. embassy in Benghazi that suffered a terrorist attack that killed four people, her reply, \u201cWhat difference does it matter?\u201d\n\nMr. Barack Obama continues his cover-up of his incompetence in fortifying the embassy and ignoring all calls for help. Good men died because of malfeasance and ineptitude.\n\nLet\u2019s start with Speaker of the House John Boehner (R-OH):\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner became a master at what Government Accountability Institute President Peter Schweizer calls the \u201cTollbooth Strategy.\u201d As Schweizer explains in his new book, Extortion: How Politicians Extract Your Money, Buy Votes, and Line Their Own Pockets:\n\n\u201cYou pay money at a tollbooth in order to use a road or bridge. The methodology in Washington is similar: if someone wants a bill passed, charge them money to allow the bill to move down the legislative highway.\u201d\n\nAccording to Schweizer, Boehner used the \u201cTollbooth Strategy\u201d to collect more than $200,000 in political donations from executives just days before holding votes on bills critically important to their industries. [Reference]\n\nAdditionally, Boehner continues his blockade of the E-Verify Bill to force employers to check legal status of anyone seeking employment. I suspect the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, up to its eyeballs in promoting illegal immigration cheap labor, paid big bucks to keep E-Verify from passing into law. No doubt Marriott, Holiday Inn, Tyson Chicken, McDonald\u2019s, Chipotle\u2019s, Hormel, La Quinta, endless restaurant chains, construction, painting, landscape and other huge companies paid huge bribes to make sure they continue to hire illegal aliens rather than American citizens at a living wage.\n\nSpeaker Boehner does not stand-alone.\n\nAttorney General Eric Holder lies so much, hides so much, aka, Fast and Furious, that he cannot tell the truth from a lie.\n\nSenator Saxby Chambliss (R-GA) makes the \u201cTen Worst\u201d list for what he actually did in 2012, but which was finally exposed in 2013. Just as with House Speaker Boehner, Chambliss\u2019s misdeeds were revealed in Peter Schweizer\u2019s book, Extortion: How Politicians Extract Your Money, Buy Votes, and Line Their Own Pockets.\n\nJudicial Watch said, \u201cChambliss is highlighted as one of the key abusers who used leadership PAC loopholes to convert campaign cash into lavish lifestyle upgrades for themselves and their family members.\n\nThe New York Times reported, \u201cThe book details the extravagant expenses of Senator Saxby Chambliss, Republican of Georgia, for instance, whose leadership PAC spent $10,000 on golf at Pebble Beach, nearly $27,000 at Ruth\u2019s Chris Steakhouse, and $107,752 at the exclusive Breakers resort in Palm Beach, Fla. The amount Mr. Chambliss spent at the Breakers in the 2012 election cycle, the book reports, is three times what the senator gave to the National Republican Senatorial Committee during the same period.\u201d\n\nFormer DHS Secretary Janet Napolitano may be one of the biggest liars of all. In August 2013 Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano stepped down from her post with \u201cpride and regret\u201d stemming from her failure to help push through the so-called \u201cDevelopment, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors (DREAM) Act.\u201d The truth: Napolitano played a major role in doing an end run around existing immigration law by helping President Obama implement his Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) directive in lieu of DREAM Act passage.\n\nDocuments obtained by Judicial Watch in June 2013 revealed that Napolitano\u2019s Department of Homeland Security (DHS) U.S. Citizenship & Immigration Services (USCIS) \u201cAbandoned required background checks in 2012, adopting, instead, costly \u201clean and lite\u201d procedures in effort to keep up with the flood of amnesty applications resulting from the DACA directive.\u201d\n\nThe granddaddy liar of them all: Barack Hussein Obama.\n\nPresident Barack Obama actually tops this \u201cTop Ten Most Wanted Corrupt Politicians\u201d list for 2013 as the driving force behind so many of the misdeeds.\n\nThis is Obama\u2019s seventh straight year on the list, dating back all the way to 2007 (in 2006, he earned a \u201cDishonorable Mention\u201d). He is a master at catch-me-if-you-can, corrupt politics.\n\n\u201cThis year, he has again acted as a one-man Congress, rewriting entire sections of federal law on his own,\u201d said Judicial Watch. \u201cNot only is his administration secretive and dishonest; its callous disregard for the rule of law undermines our constitutional republic. Examples include:\n\nPerhaps Obama\u2019s most outrageous actions over the past year were his continual lies about the ability of Americans to keep their own health insurance under Obamacare. According the Free Beacon, Obama misled the American people a total of 36 times between 2008 and 2013 with his promise, \u201cIf you like your health insurance, you can keep it.\u201d And according to NBC News, Obama knew, even as he repeated his lie, that \u201cmore than 40 to 67 percent of those in the individual market would not be able to keep their plans, even if they liked them.\u201d\n\nLet us not forget Nevada Senator Harry Reid and all the senators that voted for the S744 Amnesty Bill that legalizes 20 to 25 million illegal aliens. They and he never stood up for enforcement of internal employment laws against employers of illegal aliens, or our borders, but they bend over for big business\u2019 cheap labor interests\u2014against American workers.\n\nLast year, Harry Reid made the Judicial Watch Ten Worst list for his influence-peddling scandal involving ENN Energy Group, a Chinese \u201cgreen energy\u201d company for which Reid \u201capplied his political muscle\u201d \u2013 and which happened to be a major client of the Nevada law firm in which Reid\u2019s son, Rory, is a principal.\n\nSubscribe to NewsWithViews Daily E-Mail Alerts!
