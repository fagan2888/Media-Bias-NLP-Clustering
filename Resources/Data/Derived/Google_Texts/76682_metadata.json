Politically, America has swung back and forth between liberal and conservative administrations as evidenced by the elections of the previous century and this new one.\n\nMoreover, many have noticed that there is often scant distance between Democrat and Republican administrations. Both have been led by patricians, often the graduates of Harvard and Yale. Seigel refers to them as the \u201cclerisy\u201d defined as educated people being a class unto themselves.\n\n\u201cLiberalism has been a very expensive failure,\u201d says Seigel and points to the Obama administration as an example of \u201cthe apparent disdain for the copybook maxims of faith, family, and hard work.\u201d When liberals go to court to force schools to remove a daily prayer or a pledge of allegiance to start the day, support abortion on demand and gay marriage, seek to expand so-called \u201centitlement programs\u201d and put as many people as possible on some form of government dole, this should be obvious to anyone.\n\nThe seizure of one-sixth of the nation\u2019s economy in the form of Obamacare is yet another example and the failure of this program, passed near midnight by a straight party vote by Democratic legislators who had no idea what was in the bill, demonstrates the liberal preference for a massive central government.\n\n\u201cLiberalism has been dedicated to preserving the problems for which it presents itself as the solution.\u201d\n\nSeigel traces the beginnings of liberalism in America. \u201cAmerican liberals don\u2019t like to compare themselves with other twentieth-century ideologues. But, like all ideologies that emerged in the early twentieth century\u2014from communism and fascism to socialism, social democracy, and its first cousin, British Fabianism\u2014liberalism was created by intellectuals and writers who were rebelling against the failings of the rising middle class.\u201d\n\nAmong the intellectuals who advanced liberalism was Herbert Croly, the editor and co-founder of The New Republic whose 1909 book, \u201cThe Promise of American Life\u201d, was the first manifesto of modern American liberalism. Croly \u201crejected American tradition with its faith in the Constitution and its politics of parties and courts.\u201d This reeks of the intellectual snobbery that has dominated liberal thinking for more than a century at this point.\n\nA distinguishing element of liberalism has been its admiration of autocratic leaders and this explains its embrace of dictators from the likes of the German Kaiser, Lenin and Stalin, through to men like Fidel Castro and his murderous sidekick, Ernesto \u201cChe\u201d Guevera. The appeal of communism has always played a large role in the ideology of liberalism.\n\nWhat distinguishes liberalism today in the minds of conservatives is its rejection of the utter failure of communism and its cousin, socialism. One need only look to Russia and Europe for evidence of this, but it is manifest in America as it struggles to deal with the costs of New Deal creations such as Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, absorbing and redistributing some sixty percent of the national budget. The liberal belief in Keynesian economics whereby the government maintains the economy through massive expenditures has left America today with the largest debt in his history.\n\nLiberalism has been driven by its disdain for America\u2019s middle class that emerged from the large wave of immigration in the early 19th century and the success it has had in the business sector, entering the professions, and raising incomes. Liberalism has a deep distrust of \u201cthe masses\u201d while claiming to represent them.\n\nLiberal ideology produced Lyndon Johnson\u2019s failed \u201cWar on Poverty\u201d and embraced environmentalism with its doomsday predictions, none of which has come true. It explains President Obama\u2019s rejection of American exceptionalism. \u201cLiberal interests never reexamined their assumptions, even when faced with social and political failure. They never asked why, despite the vast sums expended, poverty had become worse rather than better.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, in the latter half of the last century, liberals invented a laundry list of \u201crights\u201d you will not find in the Constitution such as women\u2019s rights, gay rights, children\u2019s rights and even the Gaia concept of the Earth\u2019s right to be protected against human activity.\n\n\u201cIt was attitude and intentions\u2014not outcomes\u2014that matter to liberals,\u201d says Seigel.\n\nLiberalism is the ideology of intellectuals who looked down on the masses that became America\u2019s middle class and produced the greatest economy the world had ever known. Now they exist to live parasitically off of it.\n\nThe great frustration of conservatives is the inability to have a rational debate or discussion with liberals. They don\u2019t make sense. It is the curse of liberalism.\n\n[First Published by Warning Signs]", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://blog.heartland.org/2013/09/the-curse-of-liberalism/", "type": "activity", "image": "http://blog.heartland.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/middle-class-stock.jpg", "site_name": "Somewhat Reasonable", "title": "The Curse of Liberalism"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf7c1\"", "article_summary": "\u201cLiberalism has been dedicated to preserving the problems for which it presents itself as the solution.\u201dSeigel traces the beginnings of liberalism in America.\nIt is the curse of liberalism.\nWhat distinguishes liberalism today in the minds of conservatives is its rejection of the utter failure of communism and its cousin, socialism.\n\u201cAmerican liberals don\u2019t like to compare themselves with other twentieth-century ideologues.\nThe appeal of communism has always played a large role in the ideology of liberalism."}
