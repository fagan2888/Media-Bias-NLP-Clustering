Having been one of the \u201cviolators\u201d mentioned, let me tell you how I was treated.\n\nI was sent a notice for debris. I called the office of ordinance control officer Daniel Trelka to have them clarify. He then showed up at my residence, with a smug smile and a demeaning demeanor. I asked him what he had a problem with and why. I was told I couldn\u2019t have anything in my yard, not even garden fence. Everything must be inside.\n\nRELATED: City doubles code violation profits in 2015\n\nHe had a very cop attitude of \u201cI\u2019m the boss here.\u201d He told me to read the ordinances and if I don\u2019t like it, take it up with the mayor. Then I went to my mailbox, and he left me a present: a $100 bill for his time.\n\nNext, I went to the mayor\u2019s office and received no answers from Mayor Wiza. I did, however, get his assurance that he would look into and get back to me. I\u2019m still waiting.\n\nAfter about a week, I sent a request to Mr. Wiza and Mr. Trelka for clarification. I still have not heard from either.\n\nIt seems from my experience and the experiences of others around town, Trelka\u2019s job is to harass and fine citizens. Our city\u2019s ordinance code is so vague that Mr. Trelka can do as he sees fit, without question.\n\nI, for one, think that is wrong.\n\nI never thought I would say this, but I would rather have Mayor Halverson back in office.\n\nDave Czerwinski,\n\nStevens Point\n\nRead or Share this story: http://wdhne.ws/1RWNJXK", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Ordinance control seems to be about harassment, fines", "og": {"site_name": "Daily Herald Media", "description": "Ordinance control seems to be about harassment, fines", "title": "Stevens Point city inspector rude, smug", "url": "http://www.wausaudailyherald.com/story/opinion/readers/2016/04/05/city-inspector-rude-smug/82665410/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/wausaudailyherald.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Ordinance control seems to be about harassment, fines", "creator": "@wausauherald", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9856f0f423f3111be114386cf07026f1a631cc8b/c=360-0-1770-1410&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/04/05/Wausau/B9321633974Z.1_20160405155544_000_GH0DVOQCK.1-0.jpg", "title": "Stevens Point city inspector rude, smug", "site": "@wausauherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=884268453", "fb": {"app_id": 187427251271455}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "article_summary": "After about a week, I sent a request to Mr. Wiza and Mr. Trelka for clarification.\nOur city\u2019s ordinance code is so vague that Mr. Trelka can do as he sees fit, without question.\nYoung engineer at work (Photo: Getty Images/iStockphoto)Editor: I found the Journal\u2019s recent article on city ordinances to be very enlightening.\nNext, I went to the mayor\u2019s office and received no answers from Mayor Wiza.\nI called the office of ordinance control officer Daniel Trelka to have them clarify."}
