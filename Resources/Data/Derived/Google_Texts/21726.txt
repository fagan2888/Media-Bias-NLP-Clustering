A driver was killed in a crash on Interstate 91 south in Windsor Locks early Saturday morning.

Reynol Roblero Orozco, 27, of Hartford, lost control just before the exit 44 on-ramp and struck the jersey barrier on the left shoulder, state police said. The car then careened across the highway to the right and continued through a grassy area, across an on-ramp and into a wooded area, ultimately striking a tree.

Orozco died at the scene.

East Windsor firefighters and Emergency Medical Services and Windsor Locks firefighters responded.

A state police accident reconstruction team is assisting with the investigation of the crash.

State police ask witnesses to contact Trooper First Class S. Menard at Troop H in Hartford at 860-534-1062.
