Byne will also become the first physician in recent memory in the town of about 360 people, and more importantly, will help provide primary care at Medical Associates Plus@Keysville.\n\nIt is the third MAP clinic, joining one in south Augusta and one in Wrens, aimed at providing care to the underserved in the area, said J.R. Richards, CEO of MAP.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very important because of access barriers\u201d to care for residents in the area, particularly with transportation, he said. One thing the clinic is planning to do is hire community liaisons to go out into the community and talk to residents about the services available there and how they can access the care, Richards said.\n\n\u201cThey are going to be very key to the success of the facility,\u201d he said.\n\nThe clinic is housed in a building that formerly held the Keysville Family Health Center opened by Medical College of Georgia in July 2001 but abandoned years ago, town officials said. The new clinic was funded by a $920,000 grant under the Affordable Care Act to expand primary health care into underserved areas.\n\nByne, who is a family medicine physician who has also worked in Emergency Medicine, said he expected that will be the bulk of what the clinic provides and will help to \u201cget people into the system.\u201d\n\nKeysville Mayor Linda Wilkes said the new clinic is a \u201cstarting point\u201d for the town. There is a general store and a nursing home and \u201cthat\u2019s pretty much it,\u201d she said. People seek their health care in Waynesboro, or Wrens or maybe Augusta but many can\u2019t or don\u2019t like to drive.\n\n\u201cThis will give everyone the care they need,\u201d she said.\n\nAnd also might encourage growth, Wilkes told center officials.\n\n\u201cWith your coming here, we\u2019re hoping other people will follow,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need restaurants.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Augusta, georgia, newspaper, classifieds, augusta chronicle news, news, sports, entertainment, local information, masters, golf, masters tournament, local businesses, shopping, daily deals, north augusta, SRS, south carolina, CSRA, aiken, Health, Metro, Tom Corwin", "og": {"site_name": "The Augusta Chronicle", "description": "It is the third MAP clinic, joining one in south Augusta and one in Wrens, aimed at providing care to the underserved in the area, said J.R.
