The task force aims to ensure immigrants and refugees have the tools, support and encouragement they need to move forward.\n\nNew efforts include public service announcements in digital and print media, an additional $10 million of grant money to be awarded to organizations that help immigrants obtain citizenship, and the commitment of 150 AmeriCorps volunteers to help communities build welcoming teams.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re eligible, commit to becoming a citizen today,\u201d Obama says in a video kicking off the campaign.\n\nIt\u2019s an an important step for you and an important step for our nation,\u201d he adds. \u201cJoin us.
