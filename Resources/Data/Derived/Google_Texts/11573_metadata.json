The system--which was years behind schedule and millions of dollars over budget--is more complicated to use, so applications are taking longer.\n\nIn addition, some Kansans say they\u2019ve been mistakenly dropped from KanCare. They say they\u2019re being forced to go without needed care while they wait for their coverage to be restored.\n\nA spokesperson for the state agency says it\u2019s adding staff to address the problems.\n\nMore from KHI News Service's Andy Marso:\n\nThousands of Kansans seeking Medicaid benefits are being forced to wait months because of continuing problems with a new computer system and a change in the state agency responsible for handling some eligibility determinations.\n\nThe application backlog began to form in July when state officials moved Medicaid eligibility processing to the long-delayed Kansas Eligibility Enforcement System, or KEES. The software switch forced employees to use dozens of time-consuming workarounds to make the system function.\n\nThen on Jan. 1, the state transferred all Medicaid eligibility determination for elderly and disabled Kansans from the Kansas Department for Children and Families to the Kansas Department of Health and Environment.\n\nOrganizations that serve those populations say that since then, their clients have been improperly dropped from Medicaid, which in Kansas is a privatized program called KanCare.\n\nBut they\u2019re not the only ones reporting problems.\n\nPregnant women traditionally had little trouble getting Medicaid in Kansas. They are presumed eligible, and by law their applications are sent to the top of the list.\n\nBut late last month the Wyandotte County Fetal and Infant Mortality Review Board warned legislators that even those applications, which used to take seven to 10 days to process, are now taking three or four months.\n\n\u201cThis delay in service is highly detrimental to pregnant women, new mothers, newborns and infants,\u201d the review board\u2019s community action team told the Joint Committee on Home and Community Based Services and KanCare Oversight on Jan. 22. \u201cIf pregnant women are unable to present a medical card to initiate medical treatment, then prenatal care becomes delayed or nonexistent.\u201d\n\nAaron Dunkel, KDHE deputy secretary, told the group he\u2019d look into the problem.\n\nKDHE spokeswoman Sara Belfry said via email that the department has about 10,000 Medicaid applications pending, which is up from about 6,000 prior to taking on DCF\u2019s eligibility responsibilities.\n\nBelfry said \u201ca number of factors\u201d contributed to the backlog, including the open enrollment period for insurance through the healthcare.gov marketplace, which refers some Kansans to Medicaid.\n\n\u201cWe continue to take steps to address and eliminate the pending applications for all Medicaid populations,\u201d Belfry said. \u201cWe have added and redeployed staff to increase application processing capacity and continue to make system improvements to decrease application processing times.\u201d\n\nNursing homes feeling financial pinch\n\nMeanwhile, since Jan. 1, Belfry\u2019s department has instructed every Kansan having problems with Medicaid processing to call the KanCare Clearinghouse \u2014 a single 800 number associated with a small KDHE outpost of 336 state and contract employees at Forbes Field in Topeka.\n\nBut the calls are often of little help, said Shari Coatney, president and chief executive of the SKIL Resource Center, which serves Kansans with disabilities in southeast Kansas.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re telling me it\u2019s like a four-hour-plus process to get ahold of a person, and then getting your answer is a nightmare,\u201d she said.\n\nOfficials with the Kansas Health Care Association, which represents for-profit nursing homes, and LeadingAge Kansas, which represents nonprofits \u2014 both of which rely heavily on Medicaid \u2014 tell similar stories.\n\nCindy Luxem, president and chief executive of KHCA, said as nursing home residents wait for or lose their Medicaid coverage, the facilities her organization represents are feeling the financial pinch. Meadowbrook Rehabilitation Hospital in Gardner has more than $1 million in unpaid services, she said, while several other facilities are eating thousands of dollars in unreimbursed costs.\n\n\u201cThose are the kind of outstanding monies these homes are being asked to carry right now because of inefficiencies in the frickin\u2019 system,\u201d Luxem said. \u201cOur providers need to get paid, otherwise there\u2019s no reason to stay in the KanCare program.\u201d\n\nRachel Monger, director of government affairs for LeadingAge Kansas, said her organization\u2019s members started reporting similar problems around the time KEES went live that have \u201csteadily worsened\u201d since then.\n\nFor about eight months, a significant number of LeadingAge nursing homes have been carrying hundreds of thousands of dollars in outstanding bills on their books for care provided to residents waiting on their Medicaid eligibility.\n\nAs the financial strain grows, many facilities can no longer admit new residents if their Medicaid application is pending, she said.\n\n\u201cThey can\u2019t take on more liability,\u201d Monger said. \u201cSo what\u2019s actually happening is you will have frail elders who need intensive nursing care who are being denied access to that care because of these delays. If the homes aren\u2019t taking them, they\u2019re waiting months and months and months to get care, which is very serious.\u201d\n\nIndividual Kansans affected\n\nBehind every complaint from groups like SKIL, KHCA and LeadingAge, there are individual Kansans struggling to pay their medical bills.\n\nEllen Brannan was diagnosed with acute leukemia in 2013, when she was 62 years old. She lost her house and car before she could get on disability and Medicaid, and she now lives with her sister in Prairie Village.\n\nFor two years Medicaid has paid for medications and treatments that keep Brannan alive. But when she went to the pharmacy earlier this month, she was told her coverage had expired.\n\nWith the help of Haylie Colby, her social worker at the University of Kansas Cancer Center, Brannan contacted the KanCare Clearinghouse several times to find out what happened. After long waits on hold, the two of them finally got through to a clearinghouse worker. But that worker could only tell them that Brannan\u2019s Medicaid eligibility was \u201cunder review\u201d and could offer no reason why.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s under review, and they won\u2019t even let her reapply at this point,\u201d Colby said. \u201cBut she shows (up as) uninsured. So any time she goes to pick up medicine, she has to pay the full cost for all of her medicine, which she doesn\u2019t have. Then, of course, any of the bills she has from KU, she shows up uninsured when she comes in for her treatment.\u201d\n\n\u201cI just got a bill today from the hospital,\u201d Brannan said. \u201cThey want $65,371.91 by Feb 2. \u2026 If I had my disability check go straight to them, it would take almost five years (to pay off).\u201d\n\nColby said she would work with the hospital\u2019s financial department to try to prevent Brannan\u2019s bill from being sent to a collection agency.\n\nStill, she expressed frustration that she could not do more for Brannan, who will be eligible for Medicare in March.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s a survivor,\u201d Colby said. \u201cOne like I haven\u2019t seen in five years of being here, quite frankly.\u201d A three-way call with 911\n\nChristine Gordon\u2019s daughter, Autumn, also is a survivor.\n\nThe Lenexa 4-year-old has endured countless seizures in her brief life \u2014 seizures that have set her back physically and developmentally despite several prescription drugs for which Gordon says her daughter has now developed a dependence.\n\nMedicaid had paid for Autumn\u2019s treatments since she was born. But, as in Brannan\u2019s case, that changed in January when Gordon went to refill Autumn\u2019s prescriptions and was told her daughter\u2019s coverage ended Dec. 31.\n\nGordon sought an explanation. After getting passed around to case workers in her daughter\u2019s managed care company, Sunflower State Health Plan, their pharmacy benefits subcontractor and DCF, she called the clearinghouse and was on hold for two hours.\n\n\u201cWhen I was finally able to reach somebody, Autumn started to have seizures, so I had to put them on three-way with 911 because I refused to let them off the phone after spending so long trying to get ahold of them,\u201d she said. \u201cSo she was able to hear my 911 call trying to get help for my daughter.\u201d\n\nGordon said the clearinghouse worker told her Autumn\u2019s Medicaid renewal form had been filled in correctly and sent in on time, but her coverage had not been renewed.\n\n\u201c(She said that) with the transfer from DCF to KanCare, they did not have enough workers, the computer system has not been working and they were not able to get reviews processed in time,\u201d Gordon said. \u201cHowever, they did not notify any of us. I had no idea Autumn had no coverage.\u201d\n\nThe worker told her she would mark Autumn\u2019s case as urgent and in need of immediate attention, but it would take at least two days for them to begin processing Autumn\u2019s renewal.\n\nGordon\u2019s pharmacy has agreed to give her a partial refill of one of Autumn\u2019s medications without immediate payment, but can\u2019t do that with another drug, which costs more than $3,000 per refill.\n\nGordon said she and her daughter are out of options.\n\n\u201cShe has two days left of her medicine, and then we\u2019re hospital-bound,\u201d Gordon said. \u201cIf she doesn\u2019t get these medicines, this is life-threatening to her. She\u2019s addicted to them at this point and without them she goes through withdrawal.\u201d\n\n\u2018A heck of a mess\u2019\n\nRay Flickner of Kingman, a small town near Wichita, received a little more warning about the end of his mother\u2019s Medicaid coverage.\n\nFlickner said he received a letter dated Jan. 15 letting him know that his mother\u2019s coverage would be terminated at the end of the month for failure to provide some information during the review process.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know we were reviewing it,\u201d he said.\n\nHis mother, who is 84, has for about 12 years used Medicaid as a backstop to fill gaps in her Medicare coverage. This is the first time Flickner has received such a letter.\n\nHe called the clearinghouse last week and left a voicemail after waiting on hold for an hour. He left two more messages after that but as of last week had yet to get a call back.\n\nFlickner initially was reluctant to go public but said someone needs to speak up for his mom and other vulnerable Kansans who might not have people advocating for them in the Medicaid enrollment process.\n\n\u201cThat thing is broke,\u201d Flickner said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a heck of a mess.\u201d\n\nContacting legislators\n\nFlickner said he had started contacting legislators about the problem.\n\nOthers are doing the same, after responses from executive branch agencies left them unsatisfied.\n\nCoatney said SKIL repeatedly has been told that the KanCare enrollment problems will smooth out once the transition to the new computer system is complete. But she\u2019s skeptical.\n\n\u201cI would say it\u2019s gotten worse,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know that it won\u2019t get better. It is new and there\u2019s always quirks for new systems, but right now it\u2019s hard for us to see that light.\u201d\n\nCoatney\u2019s organization reached out to Senate Vice President Jeff King, an Independence Republican who represents SKIL\u2019s area. King said last week that he\u2019s aware of SKIL\u2019s concerns.\n\nBrannan and Colby spoke with Rep. Barbara Bollier, a Republican from Mission Hills, who said Brannan\u2019s situation is intolerable.\n\n\u201cIt is unconscionable for a cancer patient to be forced to spend precious energy worrying about insurance coverage when her efforts should be focused on fighting her disease,\u201d Bollier said.\n\nLinda MowBray, who works with Luxem as director of the Kansas Center for Assisted Living, said a lot of the problems go back to the KEES switch. The state had time to work things out with providers who have residents who should be on Medicaid but hasn\u2019t done so, she said.\n\n\u201cEverybody knew there was a glitch in the system,\u201d MowBray said. \u201cBut instead of saying, \u2018Let\u2019s have some amnesty, let\u2019s have some cooperation, let\u2019s send this information out again and try to get it right,\u2019 they\u2019re now just rudimentarily denying claims.\u201d\n\nLuxem questioned the wisdom of providing one KanCare Clearinghouse helpline number for more than 400,000 Kansans on Medicaid plus thousands of providers.\n\nShe said KHCA will be looking for help from Rep. Will Carpenter, a Republican from El Dorado, who chairs the House Social Services Budget Committee.\n\nMonger said LeadingAge Kansas also is looking to legislators for help because the executive branch has not responded quickly enough.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to be told, \u2018Oh just wait another month or so until we work the kinks out,\u2019\u201d Monger said. \u201cThis is actually a systemic problem that has been happening for eight months, and it does have actual human costs. So it needs to be fixed immediately, and I don\u2019t know why they\u2019re ignoring the problem.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health", "description": "Medicaid applications are piling up in Topeka because of problems with a new computer system, which are also causing some Kansans to lose their coverage.", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://kmuw.org/post/kancare-backlog-forcing-thousands-wait-coverage", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/kmuw/files/styles/medium/public/201602/kancare_clearinghouse_andy_marso.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Medicaid applications are piling up in Topeka because of problems with a new computer system, which are also causing some Kansans to lose their coverage.", "title": "KanCare Backlog Forcing Thousands To Wait For Coverage"}, "story_id": 465320205, "twitter": {"site": "@kmuw", "card": "summary", "creator": "@kmuw"}, "author": "Jim McLean", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "KanCare Backlog Forcing Thousands To Wait For Coverage"}, "nid": 62908, "datePublished": "2016-02-02", "keywords": "KanCare, Medicaid, Affordable Care Act", "wordCount": 2348, "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Cindy Luxem, president and chief executive of KHCA, said as nursing home residents wait for or lose their Medicaid coverage, the facilities her organization represents are feeling the financial pinch.\nThe application backlog began to form in July when state officials moved Medicaid eligibility processing to the long-delayed Kansas Eligibility Enforcement System, or KEES.\nBut that worker could only tell them that Brannan\u2019s Medicaid eligibility was \u201cunder review\u201d and could offer no reason why.\nThey say they\u2019re being forced to go without needed care while they wait for their coverage to be restored.\nThe agency that now handles all eligibility determinations for the state\u2019s privatized Medicaid program \u2013 known as KanCare \u2013 has about 10,000 pending applications."}
