The employee's contribution would be deducted from his or her pay.\n\n\n\nSo far, nearly 100 small-business customers in Michigan have signed up through private exchanges with iSelect and GlidePath, executives said.\n\n\n\n\n\nSteve Selinsky, director of new business and consumer solutions at HAP, said there has been some hesitation from some companies to move into private exchanges because they have extended their current policies.\n\n\n\n\"This fall, many are going to make choices. We could see increased interest in private exchange products,\" Selinsky said. \"The defined-contribution approach is a cost containment strategy if they know they only have 'X' amount to spend for benefits.\"\n\n\n\nBruce Marwil, president of Farmington Hills-based Marwil Associates, said many small businesses with 10 or fewer covered lives and up to 200 lives are exploring private exchanges and defined-contribution approaches to funding health benefits.\n\n\n\n\"The concept is sound. The problem is the rates are not competitive yet with other options,\" he said. \"I have looked at several private exchanges, and if the prices are more expensive than renewal rates, why do it?\"\n\n\n\nBut Marwil expects some companies facing high rates if they renew their current coverage to look into private exchanges and the defined-contribution approach.\n\n\n\nJay Greene: (313) 446-0325, jgreene@crain.com.
