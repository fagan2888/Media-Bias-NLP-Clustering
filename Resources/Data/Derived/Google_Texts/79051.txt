Is Fox News playing favorites with how the network is reporting on the polling of the various GOP Republican presidential candidates?

Nick Morphus, writing for Rare, noticed that Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., has consistently earned bad placement in the graphics Fox News shows its viewers regarding the poll results.

For example, earlier this week, Fox reported on a poll it conducted and displayed a graphic on the screen showing the match-ups of eight potential GOP nominees–but missing from that image was Rand Paul. Not only was Paul missing from the image; he wasn’t even included in the poll match-up with Hillary Clinton, despite other polling showing the Kentucky senator beating her in some early battleground states like New Hampshire, Iowa, and Colorado.

If Paul got the Fox snub once, it could be chalked up to an oversight in the polling (a pretty big one); but last month, the network put a graphic on its screen from an NBC/Wall Street Journal poll. Despite Paul having the best results in a match-up against Clinton, he was placed at the bottom of the list, which was not in alphabetical or any other discernible order.

The one common denominator between the two images is that Jeb Bush always gets top billing.

Do you think Fox News is purposely trying to give Rand Paul the short end of the stick? Please leave your comments below.
