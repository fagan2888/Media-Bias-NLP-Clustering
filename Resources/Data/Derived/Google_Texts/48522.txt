JACKSONVILLE, Fla. - The Jacksonville Sheriff's Office is asking for the public's help in identifying an armed robber.

Police said the man robbed an Exxon gas station at 12753 Atlantic Blvd. on Wednesday. They said he went in and walked around for a moment, waiting for customers to leave. He then approached the front counter and asked the clerk for cigarettes.

The clerk obtained the cigarettes and the robber then pulled a gun from his waistband, police said. The man said "I am taking these," grabbed the items and left the store, police said.

The robber was last seen fleeing south across Atlantic Boulevard.

He is described as a white man, 27-30 years old, 6 feet tall and between 165 and 180 pounds. He was wearing a black T-shirt, black Jaguars hat, and armed with a black handgun. The man appears to have tattoos on his right wrist and back tricep.

Anyone who has any information on his identity is asked to call JSO at 904-630-0500 or Crime Stoppers at 866-845-TIPS.
