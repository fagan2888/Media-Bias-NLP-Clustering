Intuition and rational-choice theory would suggest that, as the gap between the wealthy and everybody else increases, support for redistribution goes up. But a number of empirical studies published in recent years have cast doubt on this theory, finding that support for redistribution has remained flat, or even that it has fallen.\n\nFor instance, a 2010 study by Nathan J. Kelly, of the University of Tennessee, and Peter K. Enns, of Cornell University, concluded, \u201cWhen inequality in America rises, the public responds with increased conservative sentiment.\u201d In a 2013 paper by Matthew Luttig, of the University of Minnesota, backed up this finding, noting, \u201cthe absolute level and the changing structure of inequality have largely been a force promoting conservatism, not increasing support for redistribution as theoretically expected.\u201d\n\nIn the Times on Wednesday, Thomas Edsall argued, \u201cRedistribution is in trouble, and that is likely to tie America in knots for years to come.\u201d The Economist\u2019s Free Exchange column this week said that \u201cpoliticians betting on their Robin Hood credentials\u201d should be wary of voters, particularly older ones, because they \u201cmay be more inclined to back the Sheriff of Nottingham.\u201d On Friday, the Times published another piece, by Neil Irwin, that was headlined \u201cWhy Americans Don\u2019t Want to Soak the Rich.\u201d\n\nOn the face of it, these warnings seem justified. In addition to citing some recent academic studies, Edsall points to data from Gallup showing that, between 2006 and 2014, support for the proposition that the federal government should guarantee health-care coverage to all U.S. citizens has fallen from sixty-nine per cent to forty-five per cent. The Economist article cites a more recent study by three economists\u2014Ilyana Kuziemko, of Princeton, and Vivekinan Ashok and Ebonya Washington, both of Yale\u2014which says that declining support for redistributive policies is largely due to a shift in sentiment among the elderly. In the nineteen-seventies and eighties, people aged sixty-five and over were more favorably disposed to redistributive policies than the rest of the population. Today, they are less supportive than other age groups.\n\nIf that were all there is to say, it would be worrying news indeed for those, myself included, who support using the tax code and other policies to offset some of the alarming rise in inequality. Fortunately, it\u2019s not the entire story. Although the survey data mentioned above shouldn\u2019t be dismissed, it needs to be placed in the context of other findings suggesting that Americans have a favorable attitude to redistribution, particularly when it is couched in terms of taking from the rich rather than giving to the poor.\n\nLast year, for example, Gallup asked a random sample of people for their views on \u201cthe way income and wealth are distributed in the U.S.\u201d Almost seventy per cent of the respondents said that they were \u201cvery dissatisfied\u201d or \u201csomewhat dissatisfied\u201d with the status quo. Fewer than one in three respondents said that they were \u201cvery satisfied\u201d or \u201csomewhat satisfied.\u201d\n\nO.K., you might say, but that was just a snapshot, and the survey didn\u2019t ask about redistributive policies. What does Gallup have to say about how attitudes toward redistribution have changed over time? Quite a lot, it turns out. For the past thirty years, the polling firm has been posing two questions that specifically concern this topic.\n\nThe first question is \u201cDo you feel that the distribution of money and wealth in this country is fair, or do you feel that money and wealth should be more evenly distributed among a larger percentage of people?\u201d Since 1985, a majority of people have said that income and wealth should be more evenly distributed. The numbers have fluctuated quite a bit over the years. In the most recent survey, from 2013, fifty-nine per cent of respondents favored redistribution\u2014a similar proportion to the first survey, thirty years ago, which found sixty per cent in favor. Yet the 2013 number represents a recent drop in support: in 2008, sixty-eight per cent of respondents said they favored redistribution. That might provide more support for Edsall\u2019s suggestion that the Obama Administration\u2019s policies, particularly the Affordable Care Act, have produced a backlash among some voters. Or it might confirm the theory, supported by a number of recent studies, that these days, in contrast to the nineteen-thirties, economic recessions tend to erode support for any form of government activism.\n\nThe other Gallup question is more pointed: \u201cDo you think our government should or should not redistribute wealth by heavy taxes on the rich?\u201d In 1985, forty-five per cent of respondents chose the option \u201cYes, should,\u201d and fifty-one per cent chose \u201cNo, should not.\u201d By 2008, the numbers had flipped, and a majority had emerged favoring heavy taxes the rich: fifty-one per cent of respondents chose \u201cYes, should,\u201d and forty-three per cent chose \u201cNo, should not.\u201d Did this more liberal attitude survive the Great Recession and its aftermath? Yes, it did. In 2013, the last time Gallup asked the question, fifty-two per cent of respondents chose the \u201cYes, should\u201d option. \u201cAt this point, the American public would generally agree with Obama that wealth should ideally be more evenly distributed\u2014and a modest majority, consisting mainly of Democrats and independents, appears to support the idea of bringing about that redistribution through heavier taxes on the rich,\u201d Frank Newport, Gallup\u2019s editor-in-chief, noted.\n\nOther survey data confirm Gallup\u2019s findings. Last year, for example, the Pew Research Center found that sixty-five per cent of Americans believe the gap between rich and poor has increased during the past decade. Even more striking, sixty-nine per cent of respondents, including forty-five per cent of Republicans, said that the government should do \u201ca lot/some\u201d to reduce the income gap. Just twenty-six per cent of respondents said that the government should do \u201cnot much/nothing.\u201d\n\nIn addition to considering these findings, it is worth parsing the numbers in some of the recent academic studies. The paper by Kelly and Enns as well as the one by Luttig both use a sophisticated statistical model derived from economics (an error-correction model, if you must know) that can be difficult to interpret. The new paper by Ashok, Kuziemko, and Washington looks directly at data from the General Social Survey, which is conducted by the University of Chicago\u2019s National Opinion Research Center and has been carried out every year since 1972.\n\nAlthough the fitted trend line the authors present appears to show that the level of support for the proposition \u201cThe government ought to reduce the income differences between rich and poor\u201d slopes slightly downward, the researchers acknowledge that they can\u2019t statistically reject the hypothesis that it is actually flat\u2014i.e., that support for redistribution hasn\u2019t declined. Indeed, there is even a suggestion in the data that, since 2008, support might have increased a bit.\n\nThe researchers say that it\u2019s too early to tell whether their findings reflect a sustainable trend, which is fair. Interestingly, though, the General Social Survey also asks people what they believe the government\u2019s spending priorities should be. In recent years, \u201cassistance to the poor\u201d has been moving up the list. In 1996, it was ranked tenth, behind things like health care, the environment, and Social Security. But in the 2010 and 2012 surveys it moved up to second place, trailing only education\u2014a finding that appears to contradict the idea that the electorate is getting more conservative.\n\nAnother important consideration in looking at attitudes toward inequality is whether voters adopt more liberal policy positions as they learn more about the issue. In an article collected in a 2013 book about political representation, the political scientists Jacob Hacker, of Yale University, and Paul Pierson, of the University of California, Berkeley, point to evidence from the American National Election Studies project, a long-running survey, that suggests having more information does change people\u2019s attitudes. For many years, the survey has asked people whether it is the government\u2019s responsibility to reduce the income gap between rich and poor. Typically, the positive responses were low\u2014only about twenty-five per cent. In 2007, the survey changed the wording of the question, to detail how much money people at the top and bottom of the income distribution actually earned. \u201cThis time, 57 percent favored reducing income inequality,\u201d Hacker and Pierson write.\n\nIn a 2013 paper, four economists\u2014Kuziemko; Michael Norton, of the Harvard Business School; Emmanuel Saez, of Berkeley; and Stefanie Stantcheva, of Harvard\u2014reported some less supportive evidence. Using Amazon.com\u2019s Mechanical Turk platform, which pays people to take part in surveys, the economists presented their subjects with some pertinent information about inequality, such as how much money the rich make compared with the middle class, and the fact that average family incomes have grown more slowly during periods when the top tax rate was low. Then they asked the subjects some policy questions. Perhaps surprisingly, the researchers found that supplying information didn\u2019t increase support for redistribution to the poor. Support for taxing the rich did go up, but not by very much. \u201cOf course, a single paper can only say so much,\u201d Kuziemko wrote in an e-mail. \u201cBut I do think our results cast some doubt on the argument that if only Americans knew about the high levels of inequality, they would surely demand more redistribution.\u201d\n\nThat sounds like a reasonable conclusion. However, it isn\u2019t the only significant finding from the experiment. When the researchers presented to their subjects a slide showing that the estate tax currently affects only about 0.1 per cent of estates\u2014the very richest ones\u2014they found that this knowledge \u201chas an extremely large positive effect on estate tax support, even increasing respondents\u2019 willingness to write to their U.S. senator about the issue.\u201d Since changing the way estates are taxed\u2014by, for instance, eliminating the \u201cstep-up in basis\u201d loophole\u2014seems likely to be part of the Democratic platform in 2016, this result has immediate political implications. And, more generally, it suggests that giving people more information about specific inequities and policy proposals, as opposed to citing over-all statistics about inequality, can have a big impact on voters\u2019 attitudes.\n\nSo what\u2019s the takeaway from all of this? It is important to acknowledge that rising inequality doesn\u2019t, by itself, generate a surge in support for redistributive policies. It\u2019s also a concern that the passage and implementation of the Affordable Care Act appears to have undermined support for guaranteed health-care coverage\u2014although it\u2019s not absolutely clear to me whether this finding reflects a shift against the redistributive subsidies that are part of the act, or a lack of enthusiasm for the reform in general. (Polling data from the Pew Research Center, the Kaiser Foundation, and other organizations suggest that the public has been cool on the A.C.A. since before it was passed, in 2010.) But taking all of the evidence together, my take is that a progressive policy agenda, if carefully presented, can still win popular support.\n\nTo be sure, it isn\u2019t enough to simply point to the rise in inequality and expect an outpouring of mass support for any and all liberal policies. The argument for each proposal has to be made on its own terms, and Americans still show little enthusiasm for anything that smacks of welfare. Would-be reformers also need to avoid alienating seniors, whose declining support for redistributive measures probably reflects a fear that such policies would come at their expense, in the form of cuts to Social Security and Medicare. Still, the polling data shows that a healthy majority of Americans believe that income and wealth should be more evenly distributed, and that a smaller, but steady, majority believe that the current situation justifies heavier taxes on the rich. That surely gives the Democrats something to work with.\n\nIt all comes down to individual policies. In the cases of the estate tax, the \u201ccarried interest\u201d deduction enjoyed by hedge-fund managers and private equity, and other loopholes that benefit the very wealthy, would-be reformers can appeal to the voters\u2019 sense of fair play, which remains undiminished. In seeking to expand support for working families\u2014for example, by expanding the earned-income tax credit\u2014progressives can appeal to the widespread sympathy for the working poor. When presented in general or ideological terms, redistribution has always been a tough sell. But when the debate gets down to specific proposals, redistributive arguments can still win out.", "article_metadata": {"cache-version": 20160525190933, "description": "Redistribution has always been a tough sell, and rising income inequality doesn\u2019t, by itself, generate a surge in support.", "account-url": "https://account.newyorker.com", "wp-parsely_version": "1.7", "og": {"site_name": "The New Yorker", "description": "Redistribution has always been a tough sell, and rising income inequality doesn\u2019t, by itself, generate a surge in support.", "title": "Is Support for Income Redistribution Really Falling? - The New Yorker", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.newyorker.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Cassidy-Income-Redistribution-1200-630-17160949.jpg", "height": 630}, "updated_time": "2015-04-17T18:13:35-04:00", "url": "http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/is-support-for-income-redistribution-really-falling", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Redistribution has always been a tough sell, and rising income inequality doesn\u2019t, by itself, generate a surge in support.", "creator": "@JohnCassidy", "image": "http://www.newyorker.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Cassidy-Income-Redistribution-1200-630-17160949.jpg", "title": "Is Support for Income Redistribution Really Falling? - The New Yorker", "site": "@newyorker", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "The New Yorker", "robots": "noodp", "parsely-metadata": "{\"id\":\"3030822\",\"title_alt\":\"Is Support for Income Redistribution Really Falling?\",\"featured_image_url\":\"http:\\/\\/www.newyorker.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2015\\/04\\/Cassidy-Income-Redistribution-728-375-17160949.jpg\"}", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "environment": "prod", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1081530898", "fb": {"admins": 757909316}, "article": {"section": "John Cassidy", "tag": "Taxes", "published_time": "2015-04-17T18:13:33-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-17T18:13:35-04:00"}, "google-site-verification": "_jvLA9pRQom0-f6587wRKrNwfRtqyKzjfYWvwcZ5fxc", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "id": 3030822, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0", "news_keywords": "Economics, Gallup Polls, Income Inequality, Pew Research Center, Taxes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2e0a\"", "article_summary": "Yet the 2013 number represents a recent drop in support: in 2008, sixty-eight per cent of respondents said they favored redistribution.\nIntuition and rational-choice theory would suggest that, as the gap between the wealthy and everybody else increases, support for redistribution goes up.\nIn the nineteen-seventies and eighties, people aged sixty-five and over were more favorably disposed to redistributive policies than the rest of the population.\nIt is important to acknowledge that rising inequality doesn\u2019t, by itself, generate a surge in support for redistributive policies.\nPerhaps surprisingly, the researchers found that supplying information didn\u2019t increase support for redistribution to the poor."}
