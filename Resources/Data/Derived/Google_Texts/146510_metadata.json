The study polled Americans with less than $100,000 in household income and investible assets of less than $100,000.\n\nA third of the people surveyed aren\u2019t currently contributing anything to retirement savings (though they may have some savings already), while 19 percent said they have no retirement savings at all.\n\nNearly 70 percent of those surveyed said that saving for retirement is harder than they anticipated. More than half the people plan on saving \u201clater\u201d for retirement in order to make up for not saving now.\n\nRelated: Retirement Savings Fears Grip Americans: \u2018I Don\u2019t Have Enough\u2019\n\nBroken down by age, the median amount saved by middle-class savers in their 40s is $40,000 \u2013 but those in their 50s who answered this survey said they had only $20,000 in savings.\n\nA majority of respondents said they\u2019re not sacrificing a lot to save for retirement, but 72 percent said they should have started saving for retirement earlier.\n\nAmong those with access to a workplace retirement plan, two-thirds contribute enough toward the plan to get an employer match, with a median contribution rate of 7 percent.\n\nHere are some wise retirement savings tips, as shared by Wells Fargo in its report:\n\nMake it automatic: The beauty of a 401(k) plan is that once it\u2019s set up, it automatically deducts the cash from your paycheck so you can\u2019t forget to save. Even if you don\u2019t have access to a workplace retirement plan, you can set up auto-deposits into an IRA account.\n\nRamp it up: The number-one factor in saving for retirement is your contribution rate and regular contribution rate increases. See if your employer offers an option in which you can automatically increase your contribution on a regular basis, or set a reminder to do so on your own.\n\nLeave your savings alone: It can be tempting to pull cash out of your retirement accounts for unexpected expenses, but doing so can jeopardize your financial future.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Middle-class Americans with a written financial retirement plan are saving more than t", "title": "A Written Retirement Plan Can Double Your Savings", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/10/23/Written-Retirement-Plan-Can-Double-Your-Savings", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/09272012_retirement_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/10/23/Written-Retirement-Plan-Can-Double-Your-Savings", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/09272012_retirement_article.jpg", "creator": "@bethbrav", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Middle-class Americans with a written financial retirement plan are saving more than t", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "A third of the people surveyed aren\u2019t currently contributing anything to retirement savings (though they may have some savings already), while 19 percent said they have no retirement savings at all.\nMiddle-class Americans with a written financial retirement plan are saving more than twice as much as people without one, according to a new Wells Fargo Retirement survey.\nRamp it up: The number-one factor in saving for retirement is your contribution rate and regular contribution rate increases.\nAmong those with access to a workplace retirement plan, two-thirds contribute enough toward the plan to get an employer match, with a median contribution rate of 7 percent.\nEven if you don\u2019t have access to a workplace retirement plan, you can set up auto-deposits into an IRA account."}
