OK I don\u2019t really wonder. Here, for example, are his comments, apparently made here in Chicago:\n\nOf all the forms of inequality, injustice in health care is the most shocking and inhumane.\n\nMartin Luther King supported health care as a human right. He also knew how far we had to go as a nation in making that right a reality.\n\nKing was the energizing force behind the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC). I suspect he would be ashamed but unsurprised to see his home region so resistant to the basic expansion of health insurance coverage to Americans with incomes below the poverty line. To some extent, the extent of southern resistance is obscured by maps such as the one below, that display which states have rejected the Medicaid expansio\u00ad\u00ad\u00adn around the country:\n\nMany of the shaded states such as Wyoming and Montana are huge but sparsely populated. Others such as Wisconsin have small populations left uncovered for other reasons.\n\nHarvard post-doctoral researcher Laura Yasaitis is an expert at drawing different kinds of maps. At my request, she made me a map in which the size of every state was proportional to the number of people who landed in the \u201cMedicaid gap.\u201d (She couldn\u2019t quite do that, since states such as California and New York would simply vanish. We drew each of these states as if they had shut out 2,000 state residents instead of zero. She also taught me how to make Cartograms. SO you may see more such items in this space.)\n\nWhen we did all that, here\u2019s what the US map would like if it were scaled by the number of affected people in each state (see below):\n\nYeah, it looks a bit different, doesn\u2019t it? Nearly 90% of U.S. adults who fell in the Medicaid coverage gap live in the south.\n\nThese states have chosen to shut their poorest residents out of Medicaid. They have chosen to do so despite 100% federal subsidies (tapering down to the scandalously low level of\u202690%) for such expanded coverage. Two border states have rejected this hard-line approach. Arkansas reached a challenging compromise with the federal government. So did Kentucky. These states displayed the nation\u2019s largest declines in their proportion of uninsured residents.\n\nMeanwhile, the biggest southern states with large, poor, non-white populations have conspicuously demurred\u2014despite ample evidence that the Obama administration is willing to make significant compromises with conservative governors and Republican legislatures across the nation to make this work.\n\nWhy have southern states have taken such a hard line that punishes so many people? I suspect the best explanation is complicated. Political party, the region\u2019s historic legacy of racial inequality, the limited political influence of poor people\u2013not least the word Obama in ObamaCare\u2013all surely play a role. Whatever the explanation, millions of the nation\u2019s poorest people are locked out of basic health coverage.\n\nIf Martin Luther King, Jr. were alive today, I am confident that he would be supporting causes such as North Carolina\u2019s Moral Mondays movement, which is working to expand Medicaid. I wish they had more company.Governor Romney has recently announced that poverty reduction would be a major theme of his potential 2016 presidential run. He didn\u2019t earn much credibility on this subject last time around. If Romney is looking for his own \u201cSista Souljah moment\u201d to confront his party\u2019s excessively conservative base, he might start by urging Republican colleagues across the south to address this disgraceful situation.", "article_metadata": {"robots": "noodp,noydir", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Nearly 90% of U.S. adults who fell in the Medicaid coverage gap live in the south.\nWhatever the explanation, millions of the nation\u2019s poorest people are locked out of basic health coverage.\nWhy have southern states have taken such a hard line that punishes so many people?\nI wonder what Dr. King would think about the current health reform debate.\nMartin Luther King supported health care as a human right."}
