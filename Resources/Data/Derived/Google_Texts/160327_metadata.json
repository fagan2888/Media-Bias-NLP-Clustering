That\u2019s why The Economist magazine noted last week that the important question in America\u2019s latest fiscal crisis is not who\u2019s to blame but \u201cWhat the hell are you doing on the edge of a cliff?\u201d\n\nThat question could be asked of rookie Republican Congressman Mark Meadows who has been credited with firing the starting pistol on this most recent example of extreme politics.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t, of course, just him. Others had their fingers on the trigger, but not many. The overall tale of the tape reveals the astonishing ability of a handful of people, some of whom hold no public office, to lead the world\u2019s largest economy to the brink of what many fear would be economic chaos should the U.S. ultimately fail to pay its debts on time.\n\nOn Aug. 21 Meadows sent a letter urging House Speaker John Boehner and House Majority leader Eric Cantor to make the defunding of Obamacare a prerequisite for the continued funding of the U.S. federal government.\n\nTwo budget deadlines were fast approaching. By Sept. 30, congress had to renew appropriations to pay for salaries and programs. By Oct. 17, Congress has to renew the Treasury Department\u2019s authority to continue to pay U.S. debts. Meadows thought it was time to play some hardball with the U.S. economy.\n\nAt the urging of a prominent conservative lobbying group FreedomWorks, Republicans signed the letter with fellow Tea Party senators Ted Cruz and Rand Paul urging them on. The letter has since become known as the \u201csuicide pact\u201d with reference to the pending destruction of the Republican Party in the likelihood that the ploy would fail and/or the self-implosion of the U.S. economy.\n\nMeadows is a small Florida developer and Sunday school teacher who once owned a restaurant in North Carolina. In 2011 he returned to that state to run in a district whose borders the Republican state government had just redrawn in an act of \u201credistricting.\u201d\n\nThe new borders transformed a competitive district with a significant minority of African Americans and Latinos into a predominantly white suburban and rural district that heavily favoured Republicans.\n\nUnwilling to bet on a sure loser, the incumbent Democrat retired. Last year Meadows, running on a Tea Party platform of Christian values and small government, easily took the seat.\n\nMeadows came to Washington having signed the Tea Party\u2019s 10-point \u201cContract from America\u201d that includes the demand for the repeal of Obamacare. The contract was the result of a 2010 online request for suggestions for a Tea Party political platform that ultimately all lawmakers would be asked to sign. Texas Tea Party leader and lawyer Ryan Hecker, with the help of FreedomWorks, whose president is Tea Party member Matt Kibbe, created it.\n\nKibbe and Meadows both went to the conservative George Mason University, whose funders include the billionaire oil magnate and libertarian Koch Brothers. The Kochs, David and Charles, also fund FreedomWorks along with other wealthy conservatives such as Steve Forbes, who owns Forbes magazine.\n\nFreedomWorks\u2019 states that it \u201crecruits, educates, trains and mobilizes millions of volunteer activists to fight for less government, lower taxes, and more freedom.\u201d\n\nIt is generally considered among the most effective right-wing grassroots organizers in the country. Atlantic magazine once called it \u201cone of the most influential groups in American politics today.\u201d Repealing Obamacare is a main goal, according to its website.\n\nTo justify his daring tactics, Meadows\u2019 five-paragraph letter cited the words of founding father James Madison: \u201cThe power over the purse may, in fact, be regarded as the most complete and effectual weapon . . . for obtaining a redress of every grievance.\u201d\n\nMeadow\u2019s letter concluded, \u201cWe look forward to collaborating to defund one of the largest grievances in our time and to restore patient-centered healthcare in America.\u201d\n\nThe shutdown has lasted 16 days and the 80 Tea Party Republicans who signed the letter are insistent that Boehner remain firm. The more serious issue of a national default comes to a head Thursday. Whatever the repercussions, it\u2019s unlikely the gang of 80 will be affected. Like Meadows, they hold safe seats whose boundaries have been designed to capture strong Republican majorities and assure their re-election.\n\nwmarsden@postmedia.com", "article_metadata": {"DC.identifier": "http://o.canada.com/news/how-a-sunday-school-teacher-turned-politician-helped-trigger-the-u-s-fiscal-crisis", "application-name": "canada.com", "twitter": {"account_id": 1510104401, "creator": "@canadadotcom", "url": "http://o.canada.com/news/how-a-sunday-school-teacher-turned-politician-helped-trigger-the-u-s-fiscal-crisis", "image": "http://wpmedia.o.canada.com/2013/10/budget_battle.jpg", "title": "How a Sunday school teacher-turned-politician helped trigger the U.S. fiscal crisis", "site": "@canadadotcom", "card": "summary", "description": "WASHINGTON \u2014 It\u2019s generally believed that wrestling on the edge of a cliff is not a good idea.
