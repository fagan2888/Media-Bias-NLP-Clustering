(Photo: AP)\n\nIt felt like d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. I spent time with Iraqi journalists and intellectuals recently. They talked, anguished about the disintegration of their country. One female journalist lamented that she no longer dares go out on the streets. Her husband was killed for belonging to the wrong sect. Another desperately wanted Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki to understand that if he isn't more inclusive, Iraq is doomed to civil war.\n\nTwo decades ago, I heard identical anguish as Yugoslavia fell apart. A Serb friend didn't want to fight for the Serb cause. He wanted to identify himself, as he always had, as a Yugoslav. A Croat cab driver had had two wives, one Serb, one Muslim. His kids were a mixture. How to take sides? Impossible, he said.\n\nThis is increasingly a 21st century story: old borders and identities challenged, seized, changed. With a force Americans sometimes find hard to grasp, history, and historical grievances, are alive in many parts of the world.\n\nNew borders in Ukraine and Sudan are just two of the latest. The Kurdish part of Iraq is making secession noises, including a referendum on independence, echoing the move of Slovenia that launched the Yugoslav wars.\n\nTribal trouble is erupting in once-stable countries such as Kenya. Even Scotland is holding an independence referendum.\n\n'Isms' disappear\n\nOne reason is clear. The Cold War choice of \"isms\" that held tribalism in check \u2014 communism or capitalism, America or the Soviet Union \u2014 is gone. Borders drawn by the Great Powers are no longer inviolate.\n\nSince the Cold War, 34 countries have been created: The Soviet Union divided into 15; Czechoslovakia became the Czech Republic and Slovakia; Yugoslavia has spun off into seven countries. Russian President Vladimir Putin earlier this year simply seized Crimea from Ukraine.\n\nThe Sunni Islamic group that has declared an Islamic state in Iraq has also understood that borders are again up for grabs. Its sophisticated PR has honed in on the British-French Sykes-Picot agreement that drew Iraq's borders almost a century ago. It has declared it dead.\n\nWhat is the U.S. to do? Keeping countries together is almost always best. But this is the age of split-ups. Next up, almost certainly: Kurds, Sunnis and Shiites in Iraq. Secretary of State John Kerry recently traveled to Kurdish Iraq to stop a Kurdish secession \u2014 as U.S. officials once did in Yugoslavia.\n\nBut the Kurdish leaders aren't listening. The failed Texas court order this week to seize a Kurdish oil tanker off the U.S. coast \u2014 Iraqi leaders claim it \u2014 is one more sign.\n\nIt may be time to pragmatically consider what forces can keep stability if Iraq splits up.\n\nYugoslavia, two decades on, offers some lessons for Iraq, and hope. The parts of Yugoslavia that have best moved forward are the parts that are predominantly of one \"tribe.\" Most have already got, or are working for, European Union membership. The EU imposes standards that curb corruption, discrimination and lack of democracy.\n\nDivisions on identity\n\nIn the unhappiest part, three groups in Bosnia \u2014 Serbs, Croats and Muslims \u2014 have been forced into a new country. Not only did they lose their Yugoslav identity, they also gained a Bosnian one with the people they bitterly fought in the 1990s. The Bosnian parliament barely functions. Unemployment is high. EU membership is stalled.\n\nThe winds of sectarian war in Iraq uncannily echo Yugoslavia's. Not only is Kurdish Iraq pushing a referendum on independence, as Slovenia did. Sunni fundamentalists have seized swaths of northern Iraq and are massacring Shiites \u2014 as Serb militants once swept into towns and villages to \"ethnically cleanse\" non-Serbs.\n\nThe U.S. helped end Yugoslavia's wars with airstrikes, peacekeepers and peace accords. Though the U.S. has military advisers in Iraq and might help with airstrikes, Iraq is in a more volatile neighborhood. It could go down differently. Even so, Iraq can still follow the path of Yugoslavia's best parts. That would require a continued insistence on inclusive leadership. Plus the accountability the U.S. could not impose after U.S. forces left. That's hard, but not impossible. There is no Middle Eastern EU. But a sensible Iraqi constitution and many laws the U.S. helped craft are still in place.\n\nMuch of Yugoslavia got the 21st century new-old tribalism genie back in the bottle. Time to think about post-breakup ways to a better Iraq-Yugoslavia d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.\n\nAuthor and journalist Louise Branson is a member of USA TODAY's Board of Contributors.
