Most people who have the virus don\u2019t have any symptoms, sometimes for decades. But for some people like Lawrence, waves of intense fatigue hit several times a day.\n\nLawrence said he sometimes gets up in the morning, eats breakfast, and then heads straight back to bed for a nap. \u201cI get really bad tired spells. It\u2019s like you have to go to sleep,\u201d he said. \u201cIt takes away probably three or four hours of my waking day.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s also an increased risk of liver cancer or liver failure. So when Lawrence heard last year that there was a new drug regimen that could cure his disease, he went straight to his insurance company.\n\n\u201cThe first thing they did, of course, was deny it,\u201d Lawrence said.\n\nBut the real problem, once he did get approval, was the price tag. Each pill costs $1,000.\n\n\u201cThe first quote I got was $140,000 \u2014 and I would be responsible for $14,000 of it,\u201d he remembered.\n\nLawrence, 71, lives on Social Security. There was no way he could come up with $14,000 on his own.\n\n\u201cI went to everybody I knew of and fussed and fumed and all that stuff,\u201d he said.\n\nEventually, Lawrence got financial aid from a nonprofit to help him cover his out-of-pocket costs. Every morning at 10 a.m., he stood over his bathroom sink and swallowed two capsules.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d go, \u2018There\u2019s one thousand. And there\u2019s another thousand,\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nHealth advocates hear scenarios like this all the time from patients with a range of chronic conditions, including hepatitis C, HIV, multiple sclerosis, and rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nLast year, more than a half-million patients in the U.S. had medication costs that exceeded $50,000, according to a recent report from Express Scripts, a company that manages prescription benefits.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve heard stories of people who\u2019ve emptied their retirement savings to cover their drug needs,\u201d said Betsy Imholz, special projects director at Consumers Union, an advocacy group. \u201cIt\u2019s a really frightening, wild west situation for people who need these specialty drugs.\u201d\n\nShe and other advocates took their concerns to Covered California, the agency that implements the Affordable Care Act in the state. In May, the health exchange became the first in the country to put a cap on how much consumers pay for these drugs.\n\nStarting in 2016, most people will pay a maximum of $150 or $250 per prescription, per month. These caps are for Covered California\u2019s so-called silver and platinum plans. Bronze plans will have caps of $500.\n\nThis policy will apply only to the 2.2 million people who buy coverage on the individual market. A bill under consideration in the California legislature would extend that protection to many people with employer-based plans, as well.\n\nSeveral other state legislatures are considering similar specialty drug price caps, some as low as $100.\n\nCovered California board member Marty Morgenstern said the agency should do even more by going to the root of the problem: the pharmaceutical companies.\n\n\u201cThey charge irrational prices,\u201d Morgenstern said, \u201con specialty drugs, and on all drugs, as a matter of fact.\u201d\n\nHe said the health exchange should band together with other agencies in the state to negotiate lower drug prices.\n\n\u201cMedi-Cal, Covered California, Calpers [the benefit group for state employees], workers comp, the prison system, the state mental hospital system \u2014 we buy a hell of a lot of drugs,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m just wondering if there\u2019s some way we can leverage that, to have some impact on the drug companies.\u201d\n\nGov. Jerry Brown called for a task force earlier this year to do just this, after realizing the new hepatitis C drugs alone would cost the state more than $200 million in the next fiscal year.\n\nInsurance companies in California have also been calling for lower drug prices.\n\n\u201cThis is unsustainable, and it\u2019s going to have a major impact on the price of health care,\u201d said Nicole Kasabian Evans of the California Association of Health Plans.\n\nInsurers see a correlation between the cost of a drug and adherence, she said. Patients who can\u2019t afford what they\u2019re prescribed will sometimes split pills or not take them at all.\n\n\u201cIf you ultimately have to go back and take a second round, because you didn\u2019t take it right the first time, or you never took it and you develop a more serious health condition, it\u2019s not good for the consumer,\u201d Kasabian Evans said. \u201cAnd it costs the health care system more money.\u201d\n\nInsurers say it\u2019s only a matter of time before the costs of specialty drugs will force them to raise monthly premiums for everyone in the health plan.\n\nThe pharmaceutical industry adamantly defends its prices.\n\n\u201cThe cost and time it takes to bring new medicines to the marketplace is increasing, as biopharmaceutical companies go after harder and harder to treat diseases,\u201d said Robert Zirkelbach of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the drugmakers\u2019 trade group known as PhRMA.\n\nHe said you have to put drug prices in context. Hepatitis C drugs, like the ones Mikkel Lawrence takes, are expensive. But the cost of treating the complications of hep C is much higher.\n\n\u201cThe average annual cost of a patient with liver cancer today is over $110,000. If that patient needs to get a liver transplant, the cost is over $500,000,\u201d Zirkelbach said. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about a medicine here that cures the disease.\u201d\n\nIn most people, but not Mikkel Lawrence. Turns out that $140,000 hep C regimen he took last year didn\u2019t work. He fell into the 5 percent of patients who don\u2019t respond.\n\nBut now he\u2019s caught wind of a new drug that\u2019s coming through the pipeline. And he\u2019s already drafting a series of emails and letters to get it approved by his insurance plan.\n\n\u201cAs soon as they\u2019re out, I\u2019m taking them,\u201d he says.\n\nThis story is part of a reporting partnership that includes KQED, NPR and Kaiser Health News.\n\nKaiser Health News is an editorially independent program of the Henry J.
