BOISE, Idaho (KBOI) - Boise Police say they have arrested a man in connection to two bomb threats that were made at a west Boise business last fall.



Police say Michael Scott Fox, 52, of Boise, was arrested Thursday for making the threats in September and October of last year.



Police are not identifying the business involved, however, KBOI 2News reported on two evacuations at the HP campus in Boise in that same time period last year due to bomb threats, at least one of which involved a note left inside the building.



The building in both incidents is currently being used by Maximus, which is a call center dedicated to customer service involving the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.



Police say Fox was arrested after an intensive five month investigation that culminated in a warrant issued Thursday.



Officers say Fox was arrested at his west Boise home later Thursday afternoon.



He is being charged with two counts of felony false reporting of explosives in public places which carry a maximum sentence of five years in prison for each charge.



Police say the case continues to be investigated and more charges are possible.
