If you really want a new iPhone next Friday, and haven't ordered one yet, your only hope might be one apparently unloved model.

Apple's new iPhone 6 and 6 Plus went on sale Friday, and demand was massive.

Apple reported record pre-orders for the device, and AT&T also said it was the biggest day for pre-orders ever.

As of 9 a.m. ET Sunday, these are the estimated "available to ship" dates for each model of both phones, if ordered directly from Apple's online store.
