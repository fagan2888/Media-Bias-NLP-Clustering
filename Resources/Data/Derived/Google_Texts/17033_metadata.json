Spoiler alert\u2026 it was Hillary Clinton\u2019s daughter Chelsea. This wasn\u2019t some sort of charity event for the Clinton Foundation or a family reunion, but three full fledged campaign events in the state of New Hampshire where her mother is currently struggling in the polls. (WMUR)\n\nFormer first daughter Chelsea Clinton held events in Concord, Manchester and Portsmouth. While visiting Clinton headquarters in Salem, she mentioned the issues that are most important to her this election, including a woman\u2019s right to choose, the chance for everyone to go to college and early childhood education \u2014 topics, she said, that are motivated by the fact that she is a mother now herself.\n\nWell isn\u2019t that nice. We should also stress that she wasn\u2019t just visiting with the natives to talk up her mom. She was on the attack, taking on both Bernie Sanders and pretty much the entire GOP. (CBS News)\n\n\u201cI never thought we would be arguing about the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, in the Democratic primary,\u201d Clinton told Democrats in Manchester, one of three stops she made during her swing. She said Sanders would \u201cdismantle\u201d Obamacare, the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, and Medicare \u2014 along with private insurance programs\u2026 \u201cShe also, unlike Sen. Sanders, has articulated how she\u2019s going to pay for that proposal,\u201d Chelsea Clinton said of Hillary Clinton\u2019s plan. \u201cCurrently, there\u2019s a $19 trillion gap, give or take, between what Sen. Sanders has proposed and how he\u2019s articulated paying for those proposals,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cSo that, to me, is troubling.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m taking care to point out not only what Chelsea is saying, but who she is saying it about, and that\u2019s for a reason. I\u2019ve written virtually nothing about the woman for longer than I can remember because, with a few notable exceptions, Chelsea Clinton has stayed out of direct combat in politics. Sure, she\u2019s done all sorts of things for the Clinton Global Initiative and the Clinton Foundation, but that\u2019s ostensibly charity work. (Even though it obviously plays into her parents\u2019 ongoing political activity.) As long as she mostly stuck to those types of activities and raised her family in New York, I was fine with treating her in accordance with the usual rules as they apply to politicians\u2019 children and other relatives. Hands off. It\u2019s no fault of hers who she was born to and she\u2019s entitled to her privacy and the right to live her own life.\n\nNow, however, the worm has turned. If she\u2019s going to go out, put on the gloves and start taking shots then she has placed herself on the playing field in our American Game of Thrones. And like any other surrogate out there making the case for a candidate or policy, she is open to the same scrutiny as every other Democrat spokesperson on the trail. What do they bring to the table? What is their background which lends credence to their advocacy? In the case of Chelsea Clinton it\u2019s an easy question to answer: nothing. A big, fat zero. Chelsea Clinton is a young woman of privilege with little or no accomplishments to her credit and no real substance to champion any cause. After high school she gained admission to a prestigious university (Stanford) which may well not have even given her a second look had her surname been anything else. She\u2019s gotten a series of very well paying \u201cjobs\u201d in the media and with her parents\u2019 foundation, none of which would have been possible without the strong arm of her mother and father. She had the world handed to her on a silver platter and really hasn\u2019t had to work for a thing in her entire life. And now she wants to lecture all of the \u201chard working people\u201d of America.\n\nShe did manage to hit some of her own strengths, however, when she talked about one of her mother\u2019s primary qualifications to be president. It turns out that Hillary Clinton can sing Wheels on the Bus with the best of them.\n\nI\u2019d have been happy to continue to ignore Chelsea Clinton for the rest of her life if she\u2019d stayed in her lane. But now she\u2019s decided to dive into our pool at full speed. In the immortal words of John McClane, welcome to the party, pal.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Empty pantsuit part two", "title": "Another Clinton of no substance or accomplishments hits the campaign trail", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2016/01/13/another-clinton-of-no-substance-or-accomplishments-hits-the-campaign-trail/", "image": "http://media.hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ChelseaClinton.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@JazzShaw"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "keywords": "Bernie Sanders, Chelsea Clinton, democratic primary, Hillary Clinton,", "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-13T15:41:50+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-13T16:52:20+00:00"}, "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "article_summary": "Chelsea Clinton is a young woman of privilege with little or no accomplishments to her credit and no real substance to champion any cause.\nI\u2019d have been happy to continue to ignore Chelsea Clinton for the rest of her life if she\u2019d stayed in her lane.\nIt turns out that Hillary Clinton can sing Wheels on the Bus with the best of them.\n(WMUR)Former first daughter Chelsea Clinton held events in Concord, Manchester and Portsmouth.\nSure, she\u2019s done all sorts of things for the Clinton Global Initiative and the Clinton Foundation, but that\u2019s ostensibly charity work."}
