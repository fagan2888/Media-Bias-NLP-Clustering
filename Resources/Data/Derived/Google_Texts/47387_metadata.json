The West will not stop him. The will does not exist.\n\nPresident Obama\u2019s foreign policy in dealing with Putin can best be described as Chicken Kiev. Obama speaks briefly and hides from the media while Putin acts forcefully. Putin wants to swallow up the Ukraine, and he will because he can. Obama promised to unite people in all the states into one nation. Who knew he meant the U.S.S.R.?\n\nObama is the leader of the free world, but he has shown over the course of his presidency that his words carry zero weight. His red line on Syria meant absolutely nothing. Bashar Assad continues to kill with impunity, knowing that Putin has his back. Putin holds Obama in contempt, and Obama supporters revel in the delight that cowboy warmonger George W. Bush is no longer around. Now America can be nicer, which by itself works spectacularly everywhere except in the real world.\n\nThe reset button Hillary Clinton pressed was the beginning of the end of American influence over Russia. Now with Secretary of State John Kerry hell-bent on forcing a Palestinian State on Israel, Putin is free to control the Eastern hemisphere.\n\nObama and Kerry have proven to be everything that retired Democratic Georgia Governor Zell Miller warned America about at the 2004 Republican Convention. Miller pointed out that no group was \u201cmore weak\u201d and \u201cmore wobbly\u201d on national security than modern liberal Democrats. Told Democrats would defend us, Miller asked, \u201cWith what? Spitballs?\u201d\n\nObama desperately wanted to project a Rambo image as the guy who got Osama bin Laden, but Obama is a dove to his core. Putin knows this. Obama\u2019s most recent speech was even weak by his own low bar.\n\nNormally Obama gives a speech where the words \u201caccountable,\u201d \u201cresponsible,\u201d and \u201cunacceptable\u201d are followed by absolutely nothing. Now even that meaningless language is too tough for Obama.\n\nHe \u201curged\u201d Russia to think about what it is doing. He \u201cencouraged\u201d Putin to think about his actions.\n\nHe said \u201cwe\u2019ve made clear\u201d there will be consequences, but never defined who the \u201cwe\u201d or what the \u201cconsequences\u201d are.\n\nObama is \u201cdeeply concerned,\u201d as if anybody, anywhere cares.\n\nObama\u2019s remarks made as much sense as a bus stop vagrant high on hallucinogens screaming about the hair of the eye of the dog.\n\nHe insisted that a United Ukraine would be \u201cgood for Russia\u2019s interests.\u201d\n\nSomebody forgot to tell him he is not president of Russia. Obama loves to tell everybody what is best for them despite consistently being wrong.\n\nHe said that Putin waging war on Ukraine would be \u201cdeeply destabilizing.\u201d\n\nThat is the entire point, which everybody except Obama liberals understands.\n\nSuch an action would \u201cnot be in the interest of Russia,\u201d which again comes from a man who cannot figure out what is best for his own nation that he has run into the ground, much less somewhere else.\n\nIt would be a \u201cviolation of Russia\u2019s commitment.\u201d\n\nSomeone should remind Obama that KGB agents do not care about commitments to the West. Trained assassins do not get bogged down in paperwork.\n\nRussia would earn the \u201ccondemnation of nations around the world.\u201d\n\nRussia is not Israel. Putin does not spend every waking minute trying to be liked. He knows college students will not lead protests against his country. Leftist professors do not criticize leftist governments. Syria earned condemnation, which apparently did not impress Assad. Putin is Assad on steroids.\n\nObama claimed that \u201cthe United States supports his (Ukraine\u2019s) government\u2019s efforts,\u201d which again did not move Putin.\n\nAfter offering a bunch of hollow phrases, what was Obama\u2019s plan of action?\n\nHe would \u201ccoordinate closer with European allies.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s it everybody. A bunch of impotent European plutocrats will meet in New York City at expensive restaurants to coordinate joint expressions of concern. Meanwhile, Putin will do whatever he pleases.\n\nThe Obama Chicken Kiev policy will get more people killed, just as his tough inaction on Syria led to over 100,000 innocent civilian casualties.\n\nAmerica may be war-weary, but wars do not end when one side refuses to fight. That is called surrender. Babbling about consequences means nothing unless those consequences actually exist.\n\nObama will go back to partying with celebrities and enjoying the Academy Awards. He will go back to giving speeches on investing in education.\n\nWhat he will not do is stop a single foreign leader from carrying out plans that harm America\u2019s interests. That would be culturally insensitive of an arrogant American nation that needs to be more humble in the face of the world burning.\n\nRussia has three years to run wild, and Putin will enjoy every moment of it. If all Ukraine has is the Obama-led West to count on, then Ukraine is already finished.\n\n[youtube]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idqnFKQNHdc[/youtube]\n\nBrooklyn born, Long Island raised and now living in Los Angeles, Eric Golub is a politically conservative columnist, blogger, author, public speaker, satirist and comedian.
