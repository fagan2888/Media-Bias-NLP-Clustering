Both rejections were based on misleading accounts of divestment which created straw men of the divestment movement, and downplayed the remarkable prospects for a clean energy revolution.\n\nActivists (and kayaktivists alike) were quick to point out the flaws in Gates\u2019 argument and to highlight that by not divesting Gates is supporting the very industries that are lobbying against climate progress and whose business models are deeply out of line with averting the climate crisis. A disconcerting example of this came when Exxon Mobil endorsed Bill Gates\u2019 view. They did so, furthermore, as part of an article attempting to deny their culpability for intentionally misleading the public about the reality of human-caused climate change, and by extension the risks of its product. Like Big Tobacco before them, Exxon are facing calls for federal investigation under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act by no less than Bernie Sanders, Hillary Clinton and more. In order to try and vindicate themselves and justify their deeply problematic position on climate change, Exxon turned to Gates\u2019 views as support.\n\nGates\u2019 problematic statements remain the only response a representative of the foundation has given, and for a foundation dedicated to a better world, sharing worldviews on climate change with a corporation implicated in one of the more egregious corporate scandals arguably in human history seems like a poor position to be in.\n\nThus, while the Gates Foundation has, of course, done much good work, such a response to divestment and framing of the climate change issue should lead us to question the intentions and motivations behind Bill Gates, the Foundation and its leaders.\n\nFor instance, Warren Buffett, who owns much fossil fuel infrastructure, is the largest donor to the Gates Foundation, with donations of over $31 billion. What role does this play in the Foundation\u2019s unwillingness to divest? Also, does Bill Gates\u2019 chairman role on TerraPower, a nuclear power company, make him more willing to knock down clean energy in order to position TerraPower and their nuclear reactors favorably in the market? After all, the Atlantic interview in which Gates rejected divestment read almost like an advert for TerraPower.\n\nDivest-Invest: Two Sides of the Same Coin\n\nTo Bill Gates\u2019 credit he got the equation partly right, when he said that \u201cthe solution is investment\u201d in clean energy \u2013 a statement he backed up by committing to invest $2 billion in clean energy. However, clean energy investments are only part of the equation; if we are to solve climate change, we also need to wind down investments in the fossil fuel industry and related infrastructure, while breaking the fossil fuel industry\u2019s corrupting stranglehold on politics so that we can unlock the sorts of policies, societal changes and investments needed to tackle the climate crisis.\n\nWhile Gates claims that divestment is a \u201cfalse solution\u201d that \u201cwon\u2019t emit less carbon\u201d and that there is no \u201cdirect path between divesting and solving climate change,\u201d the 2\u00b0 Investing Initiative (and the International Energy Agency) point out that \u201cdivesting from fossil fuels is an integral piece to aligning the financial sector with a 2\u00b0C climate scenario,\u201d with reductions in fossil fuel investments of $4.9 trillion and additional divestment away from fossil-fueled power transmission and distribution of $1.2 trillion needed by 2035 if we are to achieve the internationally agreed upon 2\u00b0C target.\n\nIt seems that even Peabody, the largest private-sector coal company in the world, has a more enlightened view on divestment than Bill Gates. Peabody have recognized that by shifting perceptions around fossil fuels and spurring on legislation, divestment efforts \u201ccould significantly affect demand for [their] products and securities.\u201d Peabody\u2019s conclusion aligns closely with that of the researchers at Oxford University\u2019s Stranded Assets Program, whose influential report on divestment illustrates that the political and social power that divestment builds through stigmatizing the fossil fuel industry could also \u201cindirectly influence all investors\u2026 to go underweight on fossil fuel stocks and debt in their portfolios.\u201d\n\nContradicting Bill Gates\u2019 claim that divestment \u201cwon\u2019t emit less carbon,\u201d the \u201cradical\u201d environmentalists over at HSBC bank recently issued a research report showing that divestment could lead to less fossil fuel production and less carbon emissions. According to HSBC, divestment could help \u201cextend the carbon budget\u201d by creating \u201cless demand for shares and bonds, [which] ultimately increases the cost of capital to companies and limits the ability to finance expensive projects, which is particularly damaging in a sector where projects are inherently long term.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cMiracle\u201d of Clean Energy\n\nGates also provided a misleading assessment of the economics of the clean energy transition (seemingly out of the pages of a fossil fuel industry misinformation handbook or his favored climate contrarian adviser Bjorn Lomborg). Gates claimed that the only way current technology could reduce global emissions is at \u201cbeyond astronomical cost,\u201d such that a \u201cmiracle\u201d on the level of the invention of the automobile was necessary to avoid a climate catastrophe.", "article_metadata": {"description": "When Exxon shares your view, time to reconsider.
