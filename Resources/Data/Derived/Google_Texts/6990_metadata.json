It lists the collection of symptoms normally included in the moniker instead as \u201cantisocial personality disorder.\u201d And businesspeople may be more prone to having it.\n\nResearchers from the University of Huddersfield recently conducted a study that found an ability to mask galvanic skin responses among high-IQ individuals could indicate the presence of antisocial personality disorder, referred to in the language of this particular research as psychopathy. It\u2019s believed a combination of cunning smarts and a knack for social manipulation could help explain why psychopathic behavior is found more often in business than in the general population.\n\n\"I thought that intelligence could be an explanation for this, and it could be a problem if there are increased numbers of psychopaths at a high level in business,\u201d said lead researcher and psychological scientist Carolyn Bate in a statement.\n\nBate\u2019s research draws upon prior findings that showed out of 203 corporate professionals, roughly three percent scored high enough on two tests of psychopathic traits to qualify as embodying psychopathy \u2014 although no formal diagnoses were made. This three percent was the fuel for Bates\u2019 study because it stands in contrast to the general population\u2019s rate of only one percent. Why, she wanted to know, were business people three times more likely to embody this behavior?\n\nHer team\u2019s study recruited 50 people to answer the question. First, each person took a standard IQ test. Then they took a second test, called the Levenson Self-Report Psychopathy Scale, to assess whether they had either Factor One or Factor Two psychopathic tendencies. Factor One tendencies include boldness and extreme assertiveness. Factor Two tendencies include poor impulse control and exploitative tendencies.\n\nThe meat of the study came next: Bate hooked each participant up to a machine that read galvanic skin response (GSR). She showed them either neutral images or ones intended to shock the average person, and she recorded how people with each set of psychopathic tendencies reacted to the shocking images. Her hypothesis, that people with higher IQ scores and psychopathic tendencies were more likely not to register a GSR, was confirmed.\n\nThe upshot, she says, isn\u2019t all that clear. The findings may point in one direction, namely that people with psychopathic tendencies are usually smarter, but whether businesses need to change their practices to accommodate the research is debatable. On the one hand, she concedes \u201cthis could have a detrimental effect on our everyday lives,\u201d but she also acknowledges that business has been run the same way for many years; the necessary changes could be systemic.\n\n\"Perhaps businesses do need people who have the same characteristics as psychopaths, such as ruthlessness,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I suspect that some form of screening does need to take place, mainly so businesses are aware of what sort of people they are hiring.\u201d\n\nIn other words, of course businesses would rather higher bulldogs. But the net effect of high-ranking managers who would just as quickly step on someone\u2019s throat to get where they\u2019re going certainly seems like a negative outside the office. They might not actually kill anyone to get a promotion, but, to revert back to the language of the DSM, their antisocial tendencies may kill with kindness. Or at least what looks like kindness.\n\nSource: Bate C, Boduszek D, Dhingra K, Bale C. Psychopathy, intelligence and emotional responding in a non-forensic sample: an experimental investigation.
