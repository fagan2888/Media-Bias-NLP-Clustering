Some things, even if they share certain characteristics, shouldn\u2019t be compared. Sui generis is the braking system on a rhetorical locomotive, or at least it should be. That was a metaphor, by the way, and not a very good one.\n\nWe in the news business could stand to apply the brakes to our runaway impulse to \u201csimilize.\u201d I personally love a good simile, which can inject levity into a column. But lately we\u2019ve seen instances of simile-itis that might have saved readers and viewers some angst, even if writers and pundits were left with less to say. (Let\u2019s go light on the air horns, please.)\n\nIn the past several days, we\u2019ve heard news people and others compare Obamacare to Hurricane Katrina and Iraq. Sarah Palin compared our national debt to slavery. Countless times in recent years we\u2019ve seen \u201cNazi\u201d applied to people with whose policies or politics we disagree, none so frequently as George W. Bush, though President Obama, too, has had a few turns.\n\n1 of 8 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 What Obama didn\u2019t know View Photos The many controversies that the White House says the president was kept in the dark about.

Thousands who had bought insurance have been receiving cancellations notices from insurers. The president said he wasn\u2019t aware his promise before the rollout would result in cancellations, and Obama had repeatedly stated that, although new health-care insurance would be available through the Affordable Care Act, those willing to stay on their plan would be able to do so.In fact, that wasn\u2019t the case.

Katrina is like Sandy because they were both natural disasters, though significantly more people died in Katrina than in Sandy. Iraq is sui generis and nothing like Vietnam, to which it was sometimes compared.\n\nNazis and the Holocaust shouldn\u2019t be compared to anything else. The systematic, state-sponsored extermination of 6 million Jews, as well as others, is sufficiently horrific to stand alone. Pro-lifers who sometimes characterize abortion as a Holocaust are probably not helping the cause of revelation.\n\nFinally, slavery merits its own place in America\u2019s memory. To compare it to anything else, especially something as mundane as debt, is wrong on its face. Indentured servitude to China might have been a better choice for Palin, who qualified her remark with, \u201cThis isn\u2019t racist, but. . . .\u201d\n\nNote: Whenever you start a sentence with \u201cThis isn\u2019t racist, but . . . ,\u201d you probably shouldn\u2019t finish it.\n\nIn Palin\u2019s defense, she obviously meant no offense, and the attacks in response have been so vicious that the attacks themselves are beyond comparison. One in particular was so awful that I won\u2019t repeat it. Just as Palin didn\u2019t deserve such an onslaught, people reading this column in good faith don\u2019t deserve to have such wretched thoughts imposed on their psyches.\n\nThese recent examples of similes gone awry raise two questions: What is the impulse that drives our need to make such comparisons? And why do we react so viscerally when we do?\n\nThe impulse is usually to elucidate, i.e., this is as bad as that. But it is also partly lazy. Do we really have so little imagination that all we can do is summon Katrina every time an administration fails to meet our expectations? Or Hitler to denote our impression of bad? Surely it is a rhetorical crime to turn someone so evil into a cliche.\n\nFrom a purely political perspective, the impulse may be driven by the desire to remind people of the past transgressions of political foes. Thus, when commentators say Obamacare is like Katrina, the mind flits from Barack Obama to George W. Bush and only the differences, rather than the single similarity of administrative incompetence, register: People died in Katrina and President Obama only wants to help people. Through subliminal jujitsu, the real comparison lands in the community psyche.\n\nConversely, as Salon political writer Brian Beutler suggested during a recent conversation, even Republicans may see benefits to this comparison in that it neutralizes the ongoing, negative liability of Katrina for the GOP. But then the cycle continues into absurdity. If Obamacare collapses and Republicans present Americans with Ryancare, we likely can expect Democrats to characterize every glitch as the GOP\u2019s Katrina II.\n\nTo the most important point, comparing a horrific tragedy or atrocity to any other thing else trivializes and diminishes it. By trying to capture, quantify and categorize others\u2019 suffering, we trespass on the sacred.\n\nSome things are like nothing else \u2014 and should be left to rest in peace.\n\nRead more from Kathleen Parker\u2019s archive, follow her on Twitter or find her on Facebook.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Do we have to summon Katrina every time an administration fails?", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/kathleenparker", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Do we have to summon Katrina every time an administration fails?", "title": "Kathleen Parker: The rhetorical crimes we commit", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/kathleen-parker-the-rhetorical-crimes-we-commit/2013/11/19/0231ad56-515b-11e3-9e2c-e1d01116fd98_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2013/11/19/Editorial-Opinion/Images/Health_Overhaul_Canit_Be_Saved--0b640-1682.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@kathleenparker"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/kathleen-parker-the-rhetorical-crimes-we-commit/2013/11/19/0231ad56-515b-11e3-9e2c-e1d01116fd98_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Kathleen Parker, obamacare, health care reform, affordable care act, obamacare katrina, aca katrina, aca, affordable care act katrina, obama's katrina, obama, obama's iraq, iraq, aca iraq, obamacare iraq, rhetoric, similes, sarah palin, sarah palin debt slavery", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/kathleenparker"}, "news_keywords": "Kathleen Parker, obamacare, health care reform, affordable care act, obamacare katrina, aca katrina, aca, affordable care act katrina, obama's katrina, obama, obama's iraq, iraq, aca iraq, obamacare iraq, rhetoric, similes, sarah palin, sarah palin debt slavery", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "eomportal-uuid": "0231ad56-515b-11e3-9e2c-e1d01116fd98"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf8b5\"", "article_summary": "Sui generis is the braking system on a rhetorical locomotive, or at least it should be.\nSui generis, the Latin phrase meaning unique or one of a kind, is a helpful restraint upon the former.\nIraq is sui generis and nothing like Vietnam, to which it was sometimes compared.\nMeet Simile and Sui Generis.\nCountless times in recent years we\u2019ve seen \u201cNazi\u201d applied to people with whose policies or politics we disagree, none so frequently as George W.
