The winning ticket was in fact a 'Jackpot Prize' for $1,000,000,\" police said in a statement.\n\nThe man, who police said \"didn't speak English very well,\" became suspicious and returned to the deli on Friday to question the younger Jaghab.\n\nThe clerk told him, \"OK, I will pay you $10,000 as long as you don't involve the police,\" the police statement said.\n\nThe elder Jaghab confirmed what his son said, telling the customer, \"You only won $10,000,\" police said.\n\nIncreasingly doubtful about the Jaghabs' claims, the victim called police.\n\nDetectives determined the father and son attempted to deceive the victim and claim the winnings for themselves. Any prize worth $600 or more must be redeemed at a New York State Lottery Office and cannot be cashed in at the place of purchase.\n\nThe father and son were arraigned on grand larceny charges on Saturday. Their lawyer, Matthew Fleischer, said in court that the incident was a \"simple mistake\" on a lottery machine payout, local media reported.\n\nFleischer, who works for the law firm of Jaghab, Jaghab & Jaghab in Mineola, did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.\n\n(Reporting by Barbara Goldberg; Editing by Eric Walsh)", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Reuters Editorial", "Author": "Reuters Editorial", "DCSext.PageNumber": 1, "twitter": {"description": "A Long Island convenience store owner and his son, accused of duping a customer who spoke limited English out of a $1 million winning lottery ticket, were charged on Saturday with grand larceny.", "title": "New York shop owner, son charged in theft of $1 million lottery ticket", "image": {"src": "http://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}, "creator": "@Reuters", "site": "@Reuters", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "DCSext.rChannel": "Article - News", "sailthru.tags": "US, USA, LOTTERY, NEWYORK", "sailthru.title": "New York shop owner, son charged in theft of $1 million lottery ticket", "keywords": "US,USA,LOTTERY,NEWYORK,United States,Judicial Process / Court Cases / Court Decisions,Casinos and Gaming (TRBC),Crime / Law / Justice,New York,White Collar Crime / Fraud / Corporate Crime,Crime,Human Interest / Brights / Odd News", "DCSext.Comments": 1, "DCSext.ContentType": "Article", "news_keywords": "US;USA;LOTTERY;NEWYORK;United States;Judicial Process / Court Cases / Court Decisions;Casinos and Gaming (TRBC);Crime / Law / Justice;New York;White Collar Crime / Fraud / Corporate Crime;Crime;Human Interest / Brights / Odd News", "WT.cg_n": "World", "DCSext.ContentID_domesticNews": "USBRE9AM0ES20131124", "DCSext.ContentChannel": "domesticNews", "sailthru.date": "2013-11-24T00:01:29+0000", "DCSext.ChannelList": "domesticNews;Inspiration;SAP;everything;treasuryMarkets;Continental;Shell;Amtrak;Amtrak2;yahoo3;Adfriendly1;VerizonMap;echoActivityStream;Boston;FedExSMB;Goldman;everythingButHugin;SprintNow;OutloudFeed;chsfood;sapawareness;sapawarenesslife;MastercardTravel;statestreetetf;samsung;Pfizersafe;merrilledge;nonegative;HSBCGlobal;ubs;Intel", "DCSext.ContentHeadline": "New+York+shop+owner%2C+son+charged+in+theft+of+%241+million+lottery+ticket", "DCSext.ContentID": "USBRE9AM0ES20131124", "WT.cg_s": "U.S", "description": "A Long Island convenience store owner and his son, accused of duping a customer who spoke limited English out of a $1 million winning lottery ticket, were charged on Saturday with grand larceny.", "sailthru.contenttype": "Article", "sailthru.description": "A Long Island convenience store owner and his son, accused of duping a customer who spoke limited English out of a $1 million winning lottery ticket, were charged on Saturday with grand larceny.", "robots": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "WT.z_inlinetype": "false", "DCSext.rAuthor": "Reuters Editorial", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters"}, "DCSext.rCountry": "BETAUS", "DCSext.DartZone": "us.reuters/world/us/article", "viewport": "width=1100", "DCSext.PageTotal": 1, "WT.z_navid": "nav-Text-domesticNews", "site edition": "Reuters", "og": {"site_name": "Reuters", "description": "A Long Island convenience store owner and his son, accused of duping a customer who spoke limited English out of a $1 million winning lottery ticket, were charged on Saturday with grand larceny.", "title": "New York shop owner, son charged in theft of $1 million lottery ticket", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-lottery-newyork-idUSBRE9AM0ES20131124", "article": {"section": "World", "tag": "US,USA,LOTTERY,NEWYORK,United States,Judicial Process / Court Cases / Court Decisions,Casinos and Gaming (TRBC),Crime / Law / Justice,New York,White Collar Crime / Fraud / Corporate Crime,Crime,Human Interest / Brights / Odd News", "published_time": "2013-11-24T00:01:29+0000", "modified_time": "2013-11-24T00:01:29+0000", "author": "Reuters Editorial"}, "type": "article"}, "REVISION_DATE": "Sun Nov 24 00:01:29 UTC 2013", "DCSext.contentversion": "original"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe222d\"", "article_summary": "Fleischer, who works for the law firm of Jaghab, Jaghab & Jaghab in Mineola, did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.\nHe handed the card to store clerk Karim Jaghab, 26, the son of deli owner Nabil Jaghab, 57, police said.\nNEW YORK A Long Island convenience store owner and his son, accused of duping a customer who spoke limited English out of a $1 million winning lottery ticket, were charged on Saturday with grand larceny.\nAny prize worth $600 or more must be redeemed at a New York State Lottery Office and cannot be cashed in at the place of purchase.\nThe elder Jaghab confirmed what his son said, telling the customer, \"You only won $10,000,\" police said."}
