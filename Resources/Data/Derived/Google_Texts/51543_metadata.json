And because of that, he is The Denver Post\u2019s NBA player of the week.\n\nWhat\u2019s up: In four games, Vucevic averaged 27.5 points, 12.0 rebounds and 2.3 assists as the Magic went 2-2. He shot 63.6 percent from the field.\n\nBackground: In four NBA seasons, Vucevic has been a steady climber, and this season he\u2019s starting to gain the attention that his game deserves. A double-double machine, he leads the league in the category this season. One of his most significant \u201cdoubles\u201d came in a win over the Chicago Bulls on Jan. 12. He had 33 points and 11 rebounds as he wreaked havoc on a formidable Bulls frontcourt of Pau Gasol and Joakim Noah. Two nights later, Vucevic posted 25 points and 12 rebounds against Dwight Howard in Orlando\u2019s win over the Rockets.\n\nDempsey\u2019s take: Vucevic is one of my favorite players. He\u2019s not a household name, but he might become one. He\u2019s so consistent for a young player, and while NBA teams know about him, he still gets his numbers almost every night. He\u2019s as tough as they come in the paint and always stays on an even keel. It\u2019s just a pleasure to watch a player go out and do his job every night. He\u2019s part of a talented, young nucleus of players at Orlando that has that team on the rise.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Magic,NBA,Nikola Vucevic,spotlight", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"site_name": "Nuggets Ink", "description": "In four NBA seasons, Nikola Vucevic has been a steady climber, and this season he's starting to gain the attention that his game deserves.", "title": "Nikola Vucevic: Spotlight on Orlando Magic center", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/nuggets/2015/01/17/nikola-vucevic-spotlight-on-orlando-magic-center/12406/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/nuggets/files/2015/01/Nikola-Vucevic.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "In four NBA seasons, Nikola Vucevic has been a steady climber, and this season he's starting to gain the attention that his game deserves.", "title": "Nikola Vucevic: Spotlight on Orlando Magic center", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/nuggets/2015/01/17/nikola-vucevic-spotlight-on-orlando-magic-center/12406/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/nuggets/files/2015/01/Nikola-Vucevic.jpg", "creator": "@dempseyPost", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "language": "en, sv", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "In four NBA seasons, Nikola Vucevic has been a steady climber, and this season he's starting to gain the attention that his game deserves."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc11c\"", "article_summary": "Spotlight on \u2026 Nikola Vucevic, center, MagicWhen: It\u2019s not often these days that a player from the Orlando Magic gets a look, but Nikola Vucevic had an eye-opening week.\nAnd because of that, he is The Denver Post\u2019s NBA player of the week.\nWhat\u2019s up: In four games, Vucevic averaged 27.5 points, 12.0 rebounds and 2.3 assists as the Magic went 2-2.\nHe\u2019s part of a talented, young nucleus of players at Orlando that has that team on the rise.\nHe\u2019s so consistent for a young player, and while NBA teams know about him, he still gets his numbers almost every night."}
