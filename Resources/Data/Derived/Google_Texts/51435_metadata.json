The last thing the Buffaloes (3-4, 0-4) need is a game at a No. 17 UCLA team that has been dusted each of the last two weeks.\n\nOr is it?\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a two-edged sword there, but I\u2019ve always thought that a team that was winning and on a roll, they\u2019re always more focused,\u201d first-year Buffs coach Mike MacIntyre said. \u201cThey\u2019re always on top of everything, and they know what\u2019s at stake. Those are more dangerous.\n\n\u201cNow, they can come out and kill us, too, or we could kill them.\u201d\n\nWith star receiver Paul Richardson (ankle/probable) and leading rusher Michael Adkins II (concussion/game-time decision) limited in practice this week, CU\u2019s sputtering offense could be further slowed.\n\nThere is no shame in losing to Stanford and Oregon, which UCLA (5-2, 2-2) just did. It only knocked the Bruins out of the top 10. They\u2019re still tied for second in the South Division and control their destiny to the Rose Bowl.\n\nThis brings up MacIntyre\u2019s timing. He came to Colorado during a Pac-12 renaissance that has seen it nipping at the SEC\u2019s heels as the best league in the land.\n\nMacIntyre\u2019s San Jose State team nearly won at UCLA two years ago and at Stanford last year. His Colorado team, a 27-point underdog, has lost its four league games by an average score of 50-17.\n\n\u201cIn the league, all those young quarterbacks have matured,\u201d Mac Intyre said. \u201cAll those young players have matured. It\u2019s kind of at a good peak right now in the upper-echelon teams. My hope and my plan is those guys will ease out and my guys will keep growing and getting better, and we\u2019ll be there.\u201d\n\nHe needs his defense to get better. Now. In league play, it\u2019s giving up 624.2 yards a game, including 287.5 on the ground. It has been especially vulnerable to running quarterbacks and faces another Saturday in Brett Hundley.\n\n\u201cHonestly, we\u2019ve done some things that if you sat down and watched the film with me you\u2019d think I was crazy, but we were in every spot (in Saturday\u2019s 44-20 loss to Arizona) except one time,\u201d MacIntyre said.\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, Hundley is slumping. Against Stanford and Oregon he was 37-of-58 for 256 yards with four interceptions and two touchdowns. He ran for 99 yards in those two games.\n\nThen again, those were Stanford and Oregon. And Hundley had three true freshmen starting on his line. UCLA started eight freshmen against the Ducks.\n\n\u201cYou ask any quarterback, college or pro, guys that are aware players, they\u2019d tell you, if they\u2019re being honest, that has an effect on them when there\u2019s some uncertainty in their mind as to who\u2019s playing in front of them,\u201d UCLA coach Jim Mora said. \u201cIf it\u2019s a new group, a lack of continuity, that\u2019s going to affect you mentally.\n\n\u201cBut what Brett has taken from the Oregon game is that group played well.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not good news for a Colorado team with a struggling defense and a banged-up offense. The Buffs just hope they don\u2019t land on another sword.\n\nJohn Henderson: jhenderson@denverpost.com or twitter.com/johnhendersondp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "CU Buffs take on 17th-ranked UCLA team coming off two straight losses", "title": "CU Buffs take on 17th-ranked UCLA team coming off two straight losses", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/11/01/cu-buffs-take-on-17th-ranked-ucla-team-coming-off-two-straight-losses/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131101_105505_colorado.jpg", "height": 518}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131101_105505_colorado.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-11-01T19:16:27+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-29T09:24:35+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc0e8\"", "article_summary": "17 UCLA team that has been dusted each of the last two weeks.\nHis Colorado team, a 27-point underdog, has lost its four league games by an average score of 50-17.\n\u201cBut what Brett has taken from the Oregon game is that group played well.\u201dThat\u2019s not good news for a Colorado team with a struggling defense and a banged-up offense.\nThere is no shame in losing to Stanford and Oregon, which UCLA (5-2, 2-2) just did.\nMacIntyre\u2019s San Jose State team nearly won at UCLA two years ago and at Stanford last year."}
