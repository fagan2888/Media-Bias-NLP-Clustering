She\u2019s expected to recover but is still in intensive care at UF Health Jacksonville.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just lucky that she\u2019s alive,\u201d her brother said.\n\nChristina Nutt moved to St. Augustine about two years ago from Michigan after quitting her job. She wanted to own a business and work for herself. She had worked as a pet groomer for about 20 years and it made sense to open a similar business.\n\nPortable Pooches Spa brought the dog groomer to the customer. She quickly had success with her outgoing personality and professionalism, said Melissa Kramer, whose dog, Belle, was often groomed by Nutt.\n\nJohn Nutt said his sister had a three-month waiting list for new clients.\n\nThe well-liked dog groomer always found time for her current clients, Kramer said. She remembers once forgetting to make the appropriate appointments and how Christina Nutt still groomed her dog even though it was past when she made house calls.\n\n\u201cYou can just tell she has a good heart and she\u2019s very friendly,\u201d Kramer said.\n\nChristina Nutt had bought the 2015 Harley-Davidson motorcycle about three weeks before she crashed it. She did take a few classes to learn how to operate the vehicle as she had plans to ride across the state with her boyfriend. On June 13 her boyfriend was ahead of her on his motorcycle and a mutual friend was riding behind her. She wobbled to the right, then veered left before smashing into the guardrail, John Nutt said.\n\nShe does have health insurance as the self-employed business owner gained coverage through the Affordable Care Act. But there\u2019s still going to be thousands of dollars in medical bills.\n\nFamily in Michigan and friends in Florida have posted parts of Nutt\u2019s story on fundraising websites and trying to raise money to help her.\n\n\u201cWe want to stand with her and support her through the community,\u201d Kramer said. We don\u2019t want her finances to fall apart while she\u2019s dealing with her health.\u201d\n\nThe two websites have already raised about $4,000.\n\nAnyone can donate at youcaring.com/christina-nutt-372378 or youcaring.com/christina-nutt-371921.\n\nDerek Gilliam: (904) 359-4619", "article_metadata": {"description": "Things have gotten slightly better for John Nutt\u2019s 48-year-old sister since a trooper with the Florida Highway Patrol knocked at his door about two weeks ago.They couldn\u2019t have gotten much worse.Christina Nutt fractured her skull, ribs, hip and pelvis and lost her left arm and right leg at the knee in a St. Johns County motorcycle crash on Florida 207 June 13.
