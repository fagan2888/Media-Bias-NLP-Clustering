Ralph Prows is president and CEO of Oregon’s Health. President and CEO of Oregon's Health CO-OP

The president and CEO of Oregon’s Health CO-OP, one of Oregon’s relatively new players in the insurance marketplace, will resign and take a job as a health care executive in Louisiana, the organization announced Wednesday.

Oregon’s Health CO-OP is a consumer-operated and -oriented nonprofit, a type of insurance company that the Affordable Care Act created and supported with loans. The intent was to add to the competition in the new government-run health insurance exchanges as well as ensure that consumers were being represented in the market.

Prows is the founding leader of Oregon’s Health CO-OP, having served as its CEO since 2012.

Prows will leave in June and in July start his new job as president of Ochsner Health Network, part of Ochsner Health Systems, Louisiana’s largest nonprofit health system.

“I’m excited to return to New Orleans,” Prows said in a press release. “My family and I have strong ties to New Orleans. It’s where I trained and began my medical practice. This is a chance for us to return to a part of the country we love, for me to lead health care change across the Gulf South.”

The CO-OP’s board of directors has begun its search for a new CEO.
