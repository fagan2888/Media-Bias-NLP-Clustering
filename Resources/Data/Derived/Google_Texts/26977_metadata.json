The physicians and nurses who work there all do so voluntarily. Another sizeable cost is the rent for its space at the Mill Mall.\n\n\u201cWhen we get a good grant, that\u2019s everything for us,\u201d Seger said. \u201cBut when we don\u2019t, we\u2019re pretty hand-to-mouth.\u201d\n\nThe lean times come during a greater period of transformation in the American health care industry. The Affordable Care Act (ACA), aka Obamacare, was passed in 2010. In the last enrollment period, almost 75,000 Mainers got onto health insurance plans created under that law.\n\nEFMC serves adults who don\u2019t have health insurance or can\u2019t afford the out-of-pocket expenses \u2014 called the deductible \u2014 required before their insurance plans kick in.\n\nThe clinic\u2019s doctors provide primary care, write prescriptions and screen for some acute illnesses. They steer patients to the cheapest available options for lab work and generic medications. They also help qualifying patients to enroll in ACA-subsidized health plans, among other services.\n\nBut many of the clinic\u2019s uninsured patients fall into the so-called \u201ccoverage gap\u201d that was created when Governor Paul LePage refused to expand the number of individuals who qualify for Medicaid, known here as MaineCare, Seger said.\n\nAs originally passed, the ACA required states to allow adults below a certain income level to get on Medicaid, then offer insurance plans to all the rest. But a 2012 decision by the Supreme Court made Medicaid expansion optional for states.\n\nLePage has vetoed several attempts by the state legislature to approve those federal funds, citing costs that would fall to the state and eventually grow. That\u2019s left an estimated 70,000 low-income Mainers without health insurance, as they make too little to qualify for subsidized plans created under the ACA, yet too much to qualify for Medicaid at its pre-expansion levels.\n\nAnother free clinic in the area, Peninsula Free Health Services in Blue Hill, serves a similar group of uninsured patients, according to Administrator Pat Saunders. In January, it reopened at a new location at 26 Hinckley Ridge Road after operating at the First Congregational Church of Blue Hill. It\u2019s now open every Monday afternoon from 3 to 6.\n\nBoth Saunders \u2014 the lone employee at the Blue Hill clinic \u2014and Seger stressed that they\u2019re always looking for volunteer doctors, nurses, assistants and administrators \u2014 in addition to grants and donations.\n\nIf the needed funds don\u2019t materialize, Seger said, she\u2019d recommend that her clients turn to MCMH for primary care. According to state law, hospitals must provide coverage to patients below a certain income level.\n\nCharlie Therrien, president and chief executive officer at MCMH, said he was aware of the Ellsworth clinic\u2019s tough financial situation. If closure looks likely, he said he\u2019d try to coordinate with health care providers around the area \u2014 possibly Blue Hill Memorial Hospital and Mount Desert Island Hospital \u2014 to see if they could take any of the new patients.\n\n\u201cHaving said that, the majority [of EFMC patients] do come from the Ellsworth area. We\u2019d have to figure out how to absorb them into our system,\u201d Therrien said.\n\nAlthough financial screenings would be necessary to determine whether patients qualify for free or subsidized care, Therrien added, \u201cWe take care of anybody who presents to us.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "ELLSWORTH \u2014 Without the arrival of a large grant or donation, administrators at Ellsworth Free Medical Clinic (EFMC) are worried the facility won\u2019t be able", "og": {"site_name": "The Ellsworth American", "description": "ELLSWORTH \u2014 Without the arrival of a large grant or donation, administrators at Ellsworth Free Medical Clinic (EFMC) are worried the facility won\u2019t be able", "title": "Again short of funding, Ellsworth Free Medical Clinic may close  - The Ellsworth American", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 945, "identifier": "http://www.ellsworthamerican.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2015/04/Ellsworth-Free-Clinic-CE-2.jpg", "height": 630}, "updated_time": "2015-04-27T18:34:39-04:00", "url": "http://www.ellsworthamerican.com/featured/again-short-of-funding-ellsworth-free-medical-clinic-may-close", "type": "article"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100002128785475}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/ellsam/", "section": "Health", "tag": "_stickit", "published_time": "2015-04-27T15:47:35-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-27T18:34:39-04:00"}, "thumbnail": "http://www.ellsworthamerican.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2015/04/Ellsworth-Free-Clinic-CE-2-1024x682.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb363\"", "article_summary": "In the last enrollment period, almost 75,000 Mainers got onto health insurance plans created under that law.\nEFMC serves adults who don\u2019t have health insurance or can\u2019t afford the out-of-pocket expenses \u2014 called the deductible \u2014 required before their insurance plans kick in.\n\u201cBut when we don\u2019t, we\u2019re pretty hand-to-mouth.\u201dThe lean times come during a greater period of transformation in the American health care industry.\nAt that point, Seger said, her board would probably close the clinic and advise its 400-plus patients to seek care elsewhere.\nAlthough financial screenings would be necessary to determine whether patients qualify for free or subsidized care, Therrien added, \u201cWe take care of anybody who presents to us.\u201d"}
