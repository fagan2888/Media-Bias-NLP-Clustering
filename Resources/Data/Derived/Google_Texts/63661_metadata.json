Still, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s unflinching allegiance to the group could become a liability on the campaign trail with the activists who shot the videos promising more is to come and Congress opening investigations of Planned Parenthood\u2019s activities.\n\nRepublican presidential candidates and GOP lawmakers have called for cutting nearly $500 million in taxpayer funds that go each year to Planned Parenthood.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have all the facts but Planned Parenthood has apologized for the insensitivity of the employee that was taped and they will continue to answer questions for Congress and others,\u201d said Mrs. Clinton.\n\nShe later added: \u201cPlanned Parenthood still remains a very important part of the whole healthcare delivery system, particularly, but not exclusively, for poor women. And I just strongly believe that we need to make sure that it can continue to do that into the future.\u201d\n\nMrs. Clinton trumpeted measures that she said would empower women by breaking down barriers to higher wages, including equal pay laws, mandatory paid sick leave and affordable child care.\n\nAt an early campaign stop in West Columbia, South Carolina, she said that she viewed her quest to the first female president of the United States as an honor and a responsibility.\n\n\u201cClearly, I\u2019m not asking people to vote for me simply because I\u2019m a woman. I\u2019m asking people to vote for me on the merits,\u201d she said. \u201cI think one of the merits is I am a woman. And I can bring those views and perspectives to the White House.\u201d\n\nMrs. Clinton also took on the issues of racism and justice, saying that Americans must \u201cdig deeper\u201d to root out systemic racism that helps keep too many black families in poverty and sends too many black men to prison.\n\n\u201cAnybody who says we don\u2019t have to make any more progress is blind to what we need to do to deal with race and justice questions,\u201d she said. \u201cI think we first have to acknowledge and believe that black lives matter. It\u2019s not just a slogan.\u201d\n\nMrs. Clinton\u2019s defense of Planned Parenthood came as other top Democrats begin circling the wagons.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi joined several Democrats Thursday in calling for a federal investigation into the Center for Medical Progress, the nonprofit anti-abortion group responsible for the videos.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s have an investigation of those people who were trying to ensnare Planned Parenthood in a controversy that doesn\u2019t exist,\u201d said Mrs. Pelosi.\n\n\u201cPlanned Parenthood has said that they have done nothing illegal,\u201d she added. \u201cThey do not ever charge, which would be illegal, for fetal tissue. They have only defrayed the cost of mailing that to someone, which is not breaking the law.\u201d\n\nIn a letter to U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch and California Attorney General Kamala Harris, the Democratic lawmakers demanded an investigation of whether the Center for Medical Progress broke California\u2019s two-party consent law by secretly recording private conversations.\n\nMrs. Lynch has said hat she would review \u201call information\u201d available before deciding to launch a full investigation.\n\nCecile Richards, the president of Planned Parenthood, has insisted the organization does nothing illegal and does not profit form the sale of fetal organs for scientific research.\n\nCommercial sale of human fetal tissue is illegal under federal law. Noncommercial tissue donation is allowed if the woman undergoing an abortion gives her consent, and Planned Parenthood can collect payments to cover the cost of harvesting the specimens.\n\nHowever, Ms. Richards apologized for the \u201ctone and statements\u201d of a top Planned Parenthood official shown in the first video discussing in ghoulish detail procedures for performing partial-birth abortions, including crushing heads and leaving bodies intact to preserve organs for sale.\n\nA second video released this week by the non-profit anti-abortion group Center for Medical Progress showed another Planned Parenthood executive haggling over the price for fetal specimens.\n\n\u2981 Jessica Chasmar contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hillary Rodham Clinton rallied behind Planned Parenthood on Thursday, in the wake of multiple videos showing the group's representatives haggling over the prices for fetal organs and joking about \"less crunchy\" abortion methods that keep tissues intact.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Hillary Rodham Clinton rallied behind Planned Parenthood on Thursday, in the wake of multiple videos showing the group\u2019s representatives haggling over the prices for fetal organs and joking about \u201cless crunchy\u201d abortion methods that keep tissues intact.", "title": "Hillary Clinton defends Planned Parenthood in wake of undercover videos", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jul/23/hillary-clinton-defends-planned-parenthood-wake-un/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/07/22/HillaryClinton.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/07/22/HillaryClinton.jpg", "description": "Hillary Rodham Clinton rallied behind Planned Parenthood on Thursday, in the wake of multiple videos showing the group's representatives haggling over the prices for fetal organs and joking about \"les", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Hillary Clinton defends Planned Parenthood in wake of undercover video"}, "Author": "S.A.
