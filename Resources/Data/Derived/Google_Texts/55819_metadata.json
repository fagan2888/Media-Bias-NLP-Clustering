Decisive. Successful. Brave. Committed. True American.\n\nThat\u2019s how voters described Donald Trump in a focus group moderated by Frank Luntz on Monday night. Twenty-nine men and women from the Washington, D.C., region, out of 33 invited, participated in the session\u2014offering impassioned critiques of the GOP establishment.\n\nThe sample of supporters included Democrats, Independents, and Republicans: Most were all in for Trump.\n\nWhy? \u201cHe\u2019s voiced what everyone else is saying,\u201d one male participant said, \u201cAmerica is a brand and the brand has been hurting a very long time, and it takes somebody like Trump to bring that brand back.\u201d\n\nThat Trump is competing in a crowded GOP field doesn\u2019t seem to faze his supporters. Since his June announcement, Trump has positioned himself as the Republican frontrunner. And last week, a CNN/ ORC poll also found that he\u2019s closing the gap with Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton.\n\nBut his surge in the polls hasn\u2019t come quietly. The presidential hopeful has come to be known for calling Mexican immigrants rapists, saying that John McCain is not a war hero, and attacking Megyn Kelly following the first GOP debate. And, while his comments have stirred controversy, they are also generating traction among voters, according to the focus group. Many found his flamboyant style entertaining. Participants reported positive feelings after being shown clips of Trump criticizing Rosie O\u2019Donnell at the first debate, and flaunting his wealth.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not a politician. I won\u2019t vote for an established politician.\u201d\n\nThe panelists ranked Trump\u2019s promise to repeal Obamacare and \u201crestore the balance between U.S. trading partners\u201d highest among his various stands on the issues. Some respondents, including a woman from Mexico, pointed to Trump\u2019s visit to the U.S.-Mexico border as the moment they decided to support him.\n\nBut Trump\u2019s biggest selling point isn\u2019t what he\u2019s done\u2014it\u2019s what he hasn\u2019t. A majority of respondents are simply happy that he\u2019s not a politician, based on their negative views of members of Congress.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A focus group sheds light on the enthusiasm with which many voters have greeted his candidacy.", "author": "Priscilla Alvarez", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "A focus group sheds light on the enthusiasm with which many voters have greeted his presidential candidacy.", "title": "Why Trump Supporters Are Ready to Vote for Him", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2015/08/AP_659306779292/facebook.jpg?1440499272", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/08/donald-trump-2016-luntz/402217/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe14e6\"", "article_summary": "The sample of supporters included Democrats, Independents, and Republicans: Most were all in for Trump.\nThat\u2019s how voters described Donald Trump in a focus group moderated by Frank Luntz on Monday night.\nParticipants reported positive feelings after being shown clips of Trump criticizing Rosie O\u2019Donnell at the first debate, and flaunting his wealth.\nA majority of respondents are simply happy that he\u2019s not a politician, based on their negative views of members of Congress.\nSince his June announcement, Trump has positioned himself as the Republican frontrunner."}
