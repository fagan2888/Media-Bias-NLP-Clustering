As both patient satisfaction scores and readmission rates play a newly important role to hospital finances, determining patient and cafeteria menus has become a more delicate operation than ever before.\n\nMany food service directors are re-calibrating their menu options as a response to the law, searching for a balance of food that will nourish patients, but also leave them with positive feelings about their hospital stay.\n\nIn one study by FoodService Director Magazine, out of a sampling of 136 hospitals surveyed across the country, 40 percent said that Obamacare would impact their food service department, and 20 percent said Obamacare would greatly impact their food service (19 percent said it would have a minimal impact, and the rest said it would have no impact or weren\u2019t sure).\n\n\u201cOn the patient side, you now get penalized for high readmission, and hospitals are looking at food service as a way to bump down the readmission rate,\u201d says Becky Schilling, Editor of FoodService Director Magazine.\n\nBut here\u2019s what\u2019s really going on. The ACA reduces Medicare reimbursement payments to hospitals with excess patient readmission rates (as determined by this formula). To help lower readmission rates, many major food service providers have committed to serving lighter food that isn\u2019t smothered in cream sauce, slathered in butter, or battered and fried; meals that would make a healthy person feel like complete shit, too.\n\nIn the past year, for instance, Morrison Healthcare, a food service company that serves more than 585 hospitals and health care systems across the country, rolled out a new menu for patients that reduces sodium and calories from its standard hospital patient menu\u2014its \u201cstealth health\u201d options include multigrain pancakes, freshly prepared soups, steel-cut oats and whole wheat pasta dishes.\n\nBut like most people who\u2019ve been stripped naked, placed in a hospital gown, and forced to watch a marathon of soap operas for an extended period of time, most hospital patients often prefer a hamburger to a quinoa salad.\n\n\u201cWhat people tend to want in the hospital is comfort foods,\u201d says Angelo Mojica, director of food and nutrition services at University of North Carolina Hospitals. \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s making people happy, in a lot of cases.\u201d\n\nFrom a food service director\u2019s perspective, this is a bit of a catch-22. If a hospital\u2019s patient satisfaction scores are below a certain threshold (as determined by a survey called HCAHPS) it deals a blow to the hospital\u2019s Medicaid reimbursement under Obamacare.\n\nSo the dilemma on the hospital\u2019s food front is: do you keep patients happy by serving them onion rings, while risking increased readmission rates, or do you stick with a menu full of healthy grilled chicken dishes and risk lowering overall satisfaction scores?\n\nEven though it sounds like a case of the twilight zone, there are ways to compromise. UNCH is one example. In January, UNCH put a new, more liberal system in place, where no food item from the (outrageously exhaustive) menu is entirely off-limits to a patient. This is how it works: suppose you\u2019re recovering from a double bypass surgery as a result of a lifetime of bad food choices. A dietician puts you on something called a \u201cheart-healthy flex diet,\u201d designed to steer you toward healthier options. But none of UNCH\u2019s low-fat, low sodium menu items appeal to you\u2014not the chili lime shrimp burrito, the tilapia en papillotte, the wok-seared tofu or California rolls. You only have eyes for the fried chicken breast. UNCH will serve it to you, with a slap on the wrist.\n\n\u201cThe patient will get yellow-carded\u2014like in soccer,\u201d says Mojica.\n\nA yellow card placed on the tray of your artery-clogging meal of choice explains exactly why the hospital recommended a low-fat diet for you in the first place. Then, if you order fried chicken (or a similarly un-heart-healthy choice) for your next meal, you get red-carded, and a dietician drops in to talk you through how diet affects your overall health and well-being. But do patients actually give a shit? UNC has found that in the first few months of the program, red-carded patients have, in fact, begun to stick to their diets in statistically significant numbers.\n\n\u201cWhat happens when you take something away from someone is they get mad,\u201d says Mojica. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to drive education so that patients can be happy with the decisions they make for themselves.\u201d\n\nUNCH says the system is still too new to track whether red-carded patients have changed their food choices outside the hospital. Under Mojica\u2019s tenure, with the introduction of the hospital\u2019s lengthy and varied \u00e0 la carte menu, and this new \u201cheart healthy flex\u201d initiative, patient satisfaction scores have jumped about 70 percentage points.\n\nOn the other hand, some dieticians scoff at the idea of hospitals serving comfort food, ever.\n\n\u201cAs a dietician, I think hospitals should not compromise on health. It seems to me that should go without saying,\u201d says Susan Levin, a registered dietician at the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine. \u201cHospitals shouldn\u2019t be catering to the standard American dietary preferences, which are typically higher in salt, fat and sugar.\u201d\n\nPCRM has published multiple studies shaming \u201cthe worst hospital food environments\u201d in the country. Offenders this year include the Greenville Memorial Hospital\u2019s Heart and Vascular Institute, which PCRM noted serves hot dogs to patients, and the Virginia Commonwealth University Medical Center, which lists roast beef on the patient menu.\n\nRegardless of new financial pressures under Obamacare, hospitals should take responsibility and base their menus on low-fat, low-sodium and high-fiber options, says Levin. From her point of view, patient satisfaction scores and money aren\u2019t as important as serving nutritious food to patients and staff.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any excuse for catering to bad dietary habits,\u201d says Levin. \u201cYou have to trust that patients are smart enough to know that they are not being admitted into an Outback Steakhouse. They\u2019re being admitted into a healthcare facility whose goal is to heal them.\u201d Au revoire, fluorescent orange jello.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.column_name": "post", "sailthru.author": "Antonia Massa", "description": "Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, American patients can say au revoire to jiggly jello and stinky, gray meatloaf.", "generator": "WPML ver:3.3.6 stt:12,39,1,4,3,2,65;", "sailthru.image": "http://munchies-images.vice.com/wp_upload/jello.jpg?crop=1xw:0.84375xh;*,*&resize=700:*", "og": {"site_name": "MUNCHIES: Food by VICE", "description": "American patients can say au revoire to jiggly jello and stinky, gray meatloaf.", "title": "The End of Terrible Hospital Cuisine Is Here", "url": "https://munchies.vice.com/en/articles/americans-can-kiss-shitty-hospital-food-goodbye", "image": "http://images.vice.com/munchies/wp_upload/jello.jpg?crop=0.66666666666667xw:1xh;*,*&resize=700:*", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "https://twitter.com/munchies", "description": "American patients can say au revoire to jiggly jello and stinky, gray meatloaf.", "title": "The End of Terrible Hospital Cuisine Is Here", "image": "http://images.vice.com/munchies/wp_upload/jello.jpg?crop=0.66666666666667xw:1xh;*,*&resize=700:*", "site": "@munchies", "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.publish_date": "2014-08-12", "sailthru.header": "Think", "sailthru.title": "Americans Can Kiss Shitty Hospital Food Goodbye", "sailthru.expire_date": "2016-06-02", "sailthru.tags": "MUNCHIES, food, heart attack, hospital food, hospitals, insurance, obamacare, outcare, patients, en_US", "fb": {"admins": 100004040752840}, "keywords": "food,heart attack,hospital food,hospitals,insurance,obamacare,outcare,patients", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-12T16:20:16Z", "modified_time": "2014-08-18T13:20:29Z"}, "sailthru.description": "Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, hospitalized Americans can say au revoire to jiggly jello and stinky meatloaf.
