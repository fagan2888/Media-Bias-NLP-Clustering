The Chiefs chased Walker in free agency last March, turning him into their prized offseason acquisition, and almost immediately he became lost on their depth chart.\n\nWalker played well. If he played. He started twice and logged more than 20 snaps in only three games. Seen as a catalyst to an evolving defensive line mix, he turned into a casualty, released after one year.\n\n\u201cI dealt with that when it happened. It\u2019s an unfortunate situation. I can complain about it, but I\u2019ve let it go months ago,\u201d Walker said last week.\n\nFor the Broncos, Walker\u2019s inability to crack the Chiefs\u2019 rotation might be the best thing to happen for them. He remained a productive, if sparingly-used player, last season. The Chiefs guaranteed Walker $3.75 million on a three-year, $13.75-million contract. The Broncos kept him from signing with the Seattle Seahawks when he agreed to a two-year, $4-million contract with a $1.5-million signing bonus.\n\nValue and versatility make Walker an intriguing offseason addition in the highly anticipated switch to a 3-4 defense that, nonetheless, features uncertainty along the defensive line.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s obviously a priority as we move forward, and we\u2019ll play a lot of people,\u201d coach Gary Kubiak said.\n\nWalker, 28, didn\u2019t produce as expected in Kansas City, unable to supplant Allen Bailey or Jaye Howard. The Chiefs saved $1.7 million in salary cap space by cutting ties. Their desire to move on doesn\u2019t mean Walker can\u2019t move blockers. Insert a DVD from last season, and you will see the 6-foot-2, 305-pound Walker line up from end to nose and everywhere in between on multiple series.\n\nHe has consistently done one thing well, making him a potential fit for defensive coordinator Wade Phillips, who looks \u201cto put players in position to succeed.\u201d\n\nPressure Point\n\nVance Walker signed a two-year deal for $4-million with the Broncos, choosing Denver over Seattle. He will be counted on to provide versatility along the defensive line. A look at how he stacks up against the Broncos\u2019 two remaining defensive tackles from last season, according to Pro Football Focus:\n\n.tg {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;border-color:#ccc;}\n\n.tg td{font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;padding:3px 5px;border-style:solid;border-width:0px;overflow:hidden;word-break:normal;border-color:#ccc;color:#333;background-color:#fff;border-top-width:1px;border-bottom-width:1px;}\n\n.tg th{font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-weight:normal;padding:3px 5px;border-style:solid;border-width:0px;overflow:hidden;word-break:normal;border-color:#ccc;color:#333;background-color:#f0f0f0;border-top-width:1px;border-bottom-width:1px;}\n\n.tg .tg-ls8f{font-family:Georgia, serif !important;}\n\n.tg .tg-oa1s{font-weight:bold;font-family:Georgia, serif !important;}\n\nDefensive Lineman QB Sacks QB Hits QB hurries Snaps Vance Walker 2 1 8 238 Sylvester Williams 0 3 13 468 Marvin Austin 0 1 5 299\n\nWalker boasts pass-rushing skills. He posted 32 quarterback hurries in 2013 with Oakland, fifth best among 3-4 defensive tackles, and eight last season in 238 snaps, nearly half of which came in just two games.\n\n\u201cThe nose has a lot of versatility in this system,\u201d Walker said. \u201cThe biggest thing is really getting after the quarterback. That\u2019s something that I like to do. I\u2019m just looking forward to it.\u201d\n\nPressure up the middle defines strong defenses. In NFL parlance, it means moving the quarterback off his spot. A hand in the face or a push of the center, preventing the quarterback from planting to throw, can lead to turnovers. The Broncos delivered in many ways last season \u2014 their defense ranked first in franchise history in rushing yards allowed per game \u2014 but they were not consistently disruptive. Denver ranked 13th in turnovers produced at 25. Phillips\u2019 defense features interchangeable parts, aggressive schemes, and a focus on reaching the pocket with purpose. DeMarcus Ware spent four seasons with Phillips in Dallas, earning three first-team All-Pro berths, while averaging 15 sacks.\n\n\u201cThe new guys, the guys already here, everybody\u2019s going to be able to thrive to a new level in this type of defense,\u201d Ware said. \u201cThe offenses really have to be keen on who\u2019s bringing the pressure because this is a pressure defense.\u201d\n\nWalker, a teammate at Georgia Tech with Broncos receiver Demaryius Thomas and WWE star Roman Reigns, can help by providing impact and depth. The Broncos\u2019 want to use a rotation of players, but effectiveness is required to share snaps.\n\nIt didn\u2019t happen in Kansas City. That, Walker said, is over. Denver presents an unrivaled opportunity.\n\n\u201cWe have super high expectations. Just to be the best. We\u2019ve got a really good group of guys between the D-Line, the linebackers, the ends obviously, the cornerbacks and safeties. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been on a team more talented,\u201d Walker said. \u201cWe have high expectations. We\u2019ve just got to go out there and work every day to live up to those.\u201d\n\nTroy E.
