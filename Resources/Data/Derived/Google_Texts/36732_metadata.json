The incident has sparked several nights of violent protests.\n\nAs Jim Howard of St. Louis Public Radio writes:\n\n\n\n\"The protestors were met by heavily armored combat vehicles and officers in camouflage combat-grade body armor, some with sniper rifles. The material came via the 1033 program, under which surplus military hardware is made available from the Department of Defense to local law enforcement agencies across the country. \"The images of what appeared to be combat-ready forces arrayed against protestors flashed around the world in news and social media reports and quickly added to the tension on the streets.\"\n\n\n\nIn June, the American Civil Liberties Union issued a report that warned of the excessive militarization of American law enforcement.\n\nAs we reported at the time, the report highlighted, among other things, the growing use of SWAT teams for such seemingly mundane tasks as serving drug warrants.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"category": "Politics", "description": "President Obama has ordered a review of federal programs that supply local law enforcement agencies with military weapons and equipment after concerns over", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://wnpr.org/post/obama-orders-review-transfers-military-surplus-local-police", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/shared/npr/styles/medium/nprshared/201408/342754191.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "President Obama has ordered a review of federal programs that supply local law enforcement agencies with military weapons and equipment after concerns over", "title": "Obama Orders Review Of Transfers Of Military Surplus To Local Police"}, "story_id": 342739540, "twitter": {"site": "@wnpr", "card": "summary", "creator": "@wnpr"}, "author": "Scott Neuman, Steve Mullis", "org_id": 1, "dc": {"title": "Obama Orders Review Of Transfers Of Military Surplus To Local Police"}, "nid": 27441, "datePublished": "2014-08-23", "keywords": "military, police, violence, White House", "wordCount": 422, "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc1dc\"", "article_summary": "The material came via the 1033 program, under which surplus military hardware is made available from the Department of Defense to local law enforcement agencies across the country.\nIn June, the American Civil Liberties Union issued a report that warned of the excessive militarization of American law enforcement.\n\"There is a big difference between our military and our local law enforcement, and we don't want those lines blurred,\" the president told reporters at the White House.\nPresident Obama has ordered a review of federal programs that supply local law enforcement agencies with military weapons and equipment after concerns over how the police handled unrest in Ferguson, Mo., in the aftermath of the shooting death of Michael Brown.\nObama telegraphed the likelihood of a review on Monday when he urged a reexamination of such programs."}
