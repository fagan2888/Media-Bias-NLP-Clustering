People have until 11:59 p.m. Tuesday to complete their applications.\n\nIf you don\u2019t have insurance you may have to pay a penalty on your taxes next year \u2014 as much as 1 percent of income.\n\nDana Howard from the state marketplace Covered California says the deadline is real. There will be no more grace periods for people who encounter long lines or technical difficulties on the website. There will be no special dispensation this time for people who wait until the last minute.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not making up a new policy for people who have not taken this seriously,\u201d Howard said. \u201cThis is your health. This is a new law.\u201d\n\nOrganizers with the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) hosted health fairs through the weekend where people who had trouble signing up online by the original March 31st deadline could get help in person. They have two fairs on Monday in Los Angeles and Sacramento.\n\n\u201cI also find tons of people who say, ya know what, \u2018I was able to get all the way through the process, but I didn\u2019t pick a plan. I wasn\u2019t sure,\u2019\u201d said Elliott Petty, an organizer overseeing fairs in LA.\n\nAfter Tuesday, people will be able to sign up for insurance only if they have what is known as a \u201cqualifying life event.\u201d\n\n\u201cThings like get married, you have or you adopt a child, as well if you lose a job and therefore your health coverage goes out the door,\u201d says Howard.\n\nEnrollment in Medi-Cal, the state\u2019s no- or low-cost coverage for low-income people, has no deadline for enrollment. People who qualify can sign up anytime.\n\nThose who do not have insurance in 2014 may have to pay a penalty \u2014 1 percent of income or $95, whichever is greater.", "article_metadata": {"description": "You have until 11:59pm Tuesday to sign up for health insurance or risk paying a penalty.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Deadline Tuesday: Final Days to Enroll for 2014 Health Insurance\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2014\\/04\\/14\\/obamacare-deadline-tuesday-final-days-to-enroll-for-2014-health-insurance\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-04-14 09:50:42\",\"mod_date\":\"2014-04-16 13:28:03\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":18665,\"author_id\":\"3205\",\"author_name\":\"April Dembosky\",\"author_display_name\":\"April Dembosky\",\"tags\":[\"Covered California\",\"Tax Penalty\"],\"categories\":[\"Obamacare\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2013\\/12\\/154126477-e1387233135649.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "You have until 11:59pm Tuesday to sign up for health insurance or risk paying a penalty.", "title": "Deadline Tuesday: Final Days to Enroll for 2014 Health Insurance", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2014/04/14/obamacare-deadline-tuesday-final-days-to-enroll-for-2014-health-insurance/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2013/12/154126477-640x412.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "covered california,tax penalty", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbd37\"", "article_summary": "After various extensions, the deadline to finish signing up for a health plan under the Affordable Care Act is here.\nIf you don\u2019t have insurance you may have to pay a penalty on your taxes next year \u2014 as much as 1 percent of income.\nThose who do not have insurance in 2014 may have to pay a penalty \u2014 1 percent of income or $95, whichever is greater.\nDana Howard from the state marketplace Covered California says the deadline is real.\nEnrollment in Medi-Cal, the state\u2019s no- or low-cost coverage for low-income people, has no deadline for enrollment."}
