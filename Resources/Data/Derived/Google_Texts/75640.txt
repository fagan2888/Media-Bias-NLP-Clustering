GASTON COUNTY, N.C. -- Gaston County Government has a money problem. Human resources director Pam Overcash said they had to do something in 2015 after finding out they would pay 10 percent more in October for the county employee health insurance plan.

“We weren't looking at who should be on the health plan. We're looking at how are we going to mitigate our rising costs within the health plan,” said Pam Overcash of Human Resources Director, Gaston County.

They settled on cutting coverage for employees' spouses who can get insurance through their own jobs.

Overcash said it will save the meat of the benefits plan, an imporant recruiting and retention tool for the county and save them roughly $500,000.

“It's not just about making sure people have insurance, but I will also say the Affordable Care Act is changing everything in the nature of the insurance industry,” said Overcash.

Other self-insured counties are cutting spouses entirely saying spousal claims make up the majority of their costs.

This isn't just a county government problem. It's a growing problem in the private sector as well.

“I've talked to several companies this week,” said Cathy Graham, a benefit services director of The Employers Association.

Graham said the employers association says more companies locally are cutting spousal coverage and it's all about the money.

“There are a lot more taxes under the Affordable Care Act that plans are being required to pay, a lot more benefits that they're having to offer,” said Graham.

The Non-Partisan Kaiser Family Foundation said this is a limited problem nationally and tends to show up in companies who offer lower wages.
