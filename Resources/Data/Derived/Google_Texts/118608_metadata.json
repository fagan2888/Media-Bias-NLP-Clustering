Andrew Cuomo signed last weekend legislation aimed at easing the process for municipalities to buy their own streetlights.\n\nYes, what we\u2019re saying is there are a number of municipalities in New York that don\u2019t actually own the streetlights within their borders. Rather, the utility companies that provide electricity own them.\n\nThe result is difficulty for some with saving energy when utility companies aren\u2019t ready to switch over to more energy efficient lighting sources, such as LEDs. In cash-strapped Albany\u2019s case, finding streetlight cost savings was one of the recommendations made by the state\u2019s Financial Restructuring Board.\n\nThe legislation largely eases the process by which a municipality can attempt to purchase streetlights from a utility company, though it does not appear to make things considerably less costly. Essentially the legislation provides a clear set of guidelines for municipalities to begin the process of buying their streetlights. As state Senate sponsor Joe Griffo\u2019s office explains it, the new law:\n\nwould facilitate discussions between the parties involved by requiring that all investor-owned utilities have the appropriate tariff in place that allows municipalities to purchase streetlights. This legislation, while not forcing utilities to sell their property, would also establish specific steps to make it easier for a municipality to initiate a proceeding for the Public Service Commission (PSC) to review and approve the sale of these streetlights.\n\n\u201cAs municipalities struggle to find ways to save money while retaining adequate services for taxpayers, this legislation will make a significant difference in reducing the utility bill of localities, in which the cost savings can be truly substantial,\u201d Assembly sponsor Patricia Fahy of Albany said in a statement. \u201cThrough owning their own streetlights, villages, towns, and cities can now pave their way to an energy-efficient and taxpayer-friendly future.\u201d\n\nIn its comprehensive review report released in February, the Financial Restructuring Board suggested that changing over to LEDs in the City of Albany\u2019s streetlights would undoubtedly save money. According to the report, the annual cost is about $4.2 million with things the way they are.\n\nBut there have been issues with purchasing the lights from National Grid.\n\n\u201c(Albany) could approach National Grid in an attempt to buy the infrastructure,\u201d the report states. \u201cBased on early indications, this option could be cost-prohibitive as the City would have to pay National Grid for the present amortized value of each applicable light/pole, and potentially associated wiring, as well as the cost of the \u201cbusiness model\u201d \u2013 the future value of operations to National Grid. On top of this, the City would then have to purchase the necessary materials to upgrade and/or replace the light fixtures, and staff the necessary personnel to maintain the new infrastructure the City would then own. The costs to address over 10,000 units could be quite significant.\u201d\n\nThe report also stated that Albany could encourage National Grid to upgrade, though any work would be entirely at the company\u2019s discretion.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Capitol Confidential", "description": "Gov.
