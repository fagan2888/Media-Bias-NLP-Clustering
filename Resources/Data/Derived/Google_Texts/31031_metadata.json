The video records the deputy yell \u201cAwwww!\u201d Then the audio cuts off.\n\nManchego has a history of driving under suspension, according to a background and court record check.\n\nIn 2012, during his wife\u2019s campaign for commissioner, Manchego was arrested on an outstanding traffic ticket after a heated argument at the couple\u2019s home, where deputies had responded to a call.\n\nThe sheriff\u2019s office said its policy is to issue a ticket for driving with a suspended license.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not perfect either, but that sounds like my deputies made a mistake,\u201d Sheriff Kirk Taylor said Friday, back from a hunting trip.\n\nThe sheriff\u2019s office issued a statement earlier this week standing by the actions of its deputies \u2014 three went out on the call, including a lieutenant \u2014 to allow McFadyen to call for a ride home.\n\nShe and Ron Greenwell, chairman of the Pueblo Democratic Party, were found in McFadyen\u2019s vehicle suspected of being too intoxicated to drive.\n\nNo one was ticketed or arrested in the incident.\n\nThe two were found in McFadyen\u2019s parked vehicle, which wasn\u2019t running, and keys weren\u2019t in the ignition. They had been dropped off at their cars after visiting a Florence hot springs with friends.\n\nEarly last week, in response to information requests from news organizations, McFadyen released the deputy report and video along with a statement about the events of that night.\n\nTaylor has denied media requests for the information since March, when The Pueblo Chieftain started looking into the matter.\n\nTaylor stood by his decision on Friday.\n\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t meet the threshold of an intoxicated driver. Fundamental fairness, isn\u2019t that what the community wants? I think that\u2019s what we\u2019re looking for. We deal with facts as they are, not as what people want them to be. I think that encapsulates what I\u2019m talking about,\u201d Taylor said.\n\n\u201cThat type of incident and that type of report I would not have released to a normal citizen and because it\u2019s a commissioner, that doesn\u2019t enter into the balancing test. If this was Jane Q. Public or Joe Citizen, my decision would\u2019ve been the same and I think that\u2019s what needs to be highlighted here.\u201d\n\nThe county explains the \u201cbalancing test\u201d in its response letter to The Chieftain on March 28.\n\n\u201cIn balancing the competing public and private interests here Sheriff Taylor concludes that where there is a minor, incidental law enforcement contact and that combines with potential harm to individuals mentioned in the report through possible misunderstanding or distortion, then sound discretion calls for denial of a request to release the record.\u201d\n\nDistrict Attorney Jeff Chostner said he had requested reports and evidence in the case for some time and finally received it last week.\n\nTaylor said Chostner had asked for the information verbally and that he asked Chostner at least twice for a written request.\n\nTaylor said he forwarded the information to the DA before leaving on vacation.\n\nChostner said his office has reviewed that information and forwarded it to El Paso County prosecutors for review.\n\nThe response letter from the sheriff is attached to the online edition of this story at chieftain.com.\n\nnickb@chieftain.com", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.chieftain.com/news/1992751-120/mcfadyen-sheriff-taylor-information", "site_name": "http://www.chieftain.com", "image": "http://www.chieftain.com/csp/mediapool/sites/dt.common.streams.StreamServer.cls?STREAMOID=z8BU9mnC1Xk0Gjy4emu$P8$daE2N3K4ZzOUsqbU5sYtYG361qVY6tLPmEEseK6JbWCsjLu883Ygn4B49Lvm9bPe2QeMKQdVeZmXF$9l$4uCZ8QDXhaHEp3rvzXRJFdy0KqPHLoMevcTLo3h8xh70Y6N_U_CryOsw6FTOdKL_jpQ-&CONTENTTYPE=image/jpeg", "type": "article", "title": "McFadyen\u2019s husband allowed to drive illegally"}, "fb": {"admins": 166812535600, "app_id": 323205824384149}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Chieftain.com"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda25e\"", "article_summary": "Manchego told Barlow he didn\u2019t have it with him, so the deputy asked for his name and date of birth.\ngovernmentSheriff\u2019s office admits mistake in letting him go with suspended licenseBy nick bonham the pueblo chieftainSheriff\u2019s deputies allowed Pueblo County Commissioner Liane \u201cBuffie\u201d McFadyen\u2019s husband to drive her home with a suspended license from a controversial incident earlier this year.\nShe and Ron Greenwell, chairman of the Pueblo Democratic Party, were found in McFadyen\u2019s vehicle suspected of being too intoxicated to drive.\nRelated documentsToward the end of the dash-cam video from the Jan. 25 incident, Deputy Eric Barlow asked Troy Manchego for his license.\nThat information was relayed to a dispatcher to scan the name for criminal history and warrants, which is normal procedure."}
