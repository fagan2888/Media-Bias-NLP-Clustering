School has been back in session for a few weeks now and weekends allow kids and their families time off to have fun away from the classroom.

Local businesses, like Wonderworks in Panama City Beach could be a place the family can go to have fun, but also learn a thing or two.

Bay County's favorite upside down building features more than 100 exhibits and games for the whole family to enjoy.

"We've got just a lot of stuff for kids that are four and kids that are 84, so there's a lot of stuff to do with for kids, teenagers and parents and stuff," said Mark Bocon, a Manager at Wonderworks.

Wonderworks is open daily starting at 10 a.m. and for more information about the amusement park, their Panama City Beach website is http://www.wonderworksonline.com/panama-city-beach/
