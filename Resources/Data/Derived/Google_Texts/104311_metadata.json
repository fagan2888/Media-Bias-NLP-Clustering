The group says it\u2019s an issue of workplace safety.\n\nBut it\u2019s also an issue of constitutional rights. A law requiring performers to wear condoms is a law that changes the content of entertainment, which is speech, and the content of speech is protected by the First Amendment from government meddling.\n\nThe issue of workplace safety may be a legal front for the real goal of the law.\n\nEver since screen legend Clark Gable took off his shirt in a 1934 film to reveal his bare chest, triggering a nationwide plunge in the sales of men\u2019s undershirts, people have known that entertainment has a tremendous influence over behavior.\n\nThe director of \u201cIt Happened One Night\u201d later explained that the actor didn\u2019t wear an undershirt because removing it slowed down the scene. Frank Capra wasn\u2019t lobbied by anti-undershirt activists or contacted by government officials about public wardrobe issues.\n\nToday, that kind of outreach is part of the entertainment landscape. White House adviser Valerie Jarrett met with Hollywood writers and producers about creating storylines featuring the Affordable Care Act. The Centers for Disease Control has an \u201cEntertainment Education Program\u201d to get health information into the scripts of TV shows. \u201cBecause 88 percent of Americans learn about health issues from television, CDC recognizes that prime time and daytime television programming are great outlets for our health messages,\u201d the CDC\u2019s website explains.\n\nSo the proposed statewide law requiring condoms in porn may be aimed more at influencing the public than protecting the health of performers. The goal may be to turn porn stars into role models for safe sex.\n\nLos Angeles County voters passed a similar requirement in 2012. The immediate result of Measure B was a sharp decline in jobs in the San Fernando Valley. According to industry estimates and film permit records, the number of adult films produced in Los Angeles went from 5,000 in 2011 to just 40 last year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe productions didn\u2019t leave L.A. because the regulation increased costs, although it did, but because it required a change in the content of the films. Producers who chose not to change the content of their films could not legally make them in Los Angeles County.\n\nThat\u2019s what makes this an issue of freedom of speech. Even when the motives are good, freedom is the first casualty when government exercises control over the content of entertainment.\n\nThe writers and producers who met with Valerie Jarrett work for media conglomerates, subject to federal regulations and affected by administration policies. There\u2019s an implicit pressure that accompanies a request from a top White House official.\n\nWe soon could see similar pressure from our state government. In September, Gov. Jerry Brown signed a law that increases to $400 million a year the subsidies available for film and TV productions in California, but the subsidies will no longer be awarded by a random lottery drawing. Under the new law, government officials will decide which eligible productions bring the greatest benefit to Californians.\n\nWill studio executives quietly avoid projects with storylines that contradict the views of those government officials? Could writers be asked to include a few lines here and there in support of the governor\u2019s policy goals?\n\nIn places like North Korea, the state-run media present only the content that meets with the government\u2019s approval. All other viewpoints are invisible, silenced, cowering in anonymity.\n\nFor people who believe in freedom of speech, that\u2019s really obscene.\n\nSusan Shelley is a San Fernando Valley author, a former television associate producer and twice a Republican Assembly candidate.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The AIDS Healthcare Foundation announced recently it will launch a signature drive seeking to put a condoms-in-porn measure on California\u2019s 2016 ballot.
