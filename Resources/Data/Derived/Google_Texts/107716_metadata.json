The alleged crimes happened in 1999-2000 and involved at least one young girl when he lived in Belle Chasse, according to investigators.\n\nThe Plaquemines Parish Sheriff\u2019s Office believes more victims are possible and are urging them to come forward.\n\nThe investigation began in May 2014 when a victim came forward, telling investigators that Wallis abused her at his home in the 100 block of Brentwood Drive when she was between 4 and 5 years old.\n\n\u201cThe victim reported that Wallis forced her to perform oral sex on him and that he performed oral sex on her,\u201d the Sheriff\u2019s Office said in a news release. \u201cThe victim also related that on several occasions, Wallis touched her inappropriately on her genital area and that he made her touch his genital area.\u201d\n\nSeveral witness were interviews about the allegations and later discovered that Wallis had video-recorded at least one of the sexual acts.\n\nHowever, that piece of evidence will never be seen.\n\n\u201cWhen the video was allegedly brought to the attention of Wallis\u2019 mother, she reprimanded those who found it and questioned them on why were they in his room and using the camcorder,\u201d the Sheriff\u2019s Office said. \u201cWallis\u2019 mother allegedly informed a family member that she burned this particular videotape in order to destroy the evidence and to \u2018make this all just go away.\u2019\u201d\n\nWallis\u2019 parents admitted that they destroyed the videotape, authorities said.\n\nAccording to Commander Eric Becnel, Wallis' parents won't face any charges because \"the statute of limitations is six years, so unfortunately, we're unable to charge them with the crimes they are responsible for.\"\n\nThe sexual abuse wasn\u2019t all a silent matter, according to investigators.\n\nInvestigators learned that about the same time of the tape\u2019s destruction, a second victim allegedly came forward and spoke with the bishop of Wallis\u2019 church about the matter.\n\nThe church was identified by the Sheriff\u2019s Office as the Church of Jesus Christ Latter Day Saints based in Harvey.\n\n\u201cIt is believed that Wallis subsequently met and spoke with the bishop of the church about the alleged crimes and possibly \u2018confessed his sins\u2019 to the religious leader at the time,\u201d the news release said.\n\nWitnesses told investigators that Wallis allegedly went through a \u201crepentance program\u201d with the church.\n\nWhen investigators interviewed a bishop of the Harvey-based church who was assigned there during the time period, the leader confirmed his assignment and acknowledged remembering the suspect\u2019s family.\n\nHowever, the bishop said he did not recall being told of the alleged sexual abuse committed by Wallis on either victim.\n\nThat\u2019s when investigators learned that there was another bishop assigned to the church during the time in question. That bishop is now deceased and is believed to be the one who \u201cabsolved Wallis of his sins.\u201d\n\nIn early-August, investigators obtained a warrant for Wallis\u2019 arrest and discovered he was living in Ogden, Utah.\n\nWallis was arrested by U.S. marshals and extradited back to Plaquemines Parish.\n\nWallis did not provide a statement to investigators.\n\nOn Wednesday, Wallis appeared in Magistrate Court in the 25th Judicial District Court. His bond was set at $100,000.\n\nWallis posted bond and was released from custody after the hearing.\n\nOther victims or people with information in this matter are asked to contact PPSO Detective Aaron Verrette at 504-564-2525 or 504-297-5277 or Crimestopppers at 504-822-1111 or toll free at 877-903-STOP.\n\nSexual abuse victims under the age of 17 have up to 30 years to report a crime once they reach the age of 18.\n\nSign up for our email newsletters to get breaking news right in your inbox.
