Trump repeated \u2013 favorably \u2013 an apparent myth about how General John Pershing summarily executed dozens of Muslim prisoners in the Philippines with tainted ammunition during a guerilla war against the occupying United States.\n\n\u201cHe took fifty bullets, and he dipped them in pig\u2019s blood,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd he had his men load his rifles and he lined up the fifty people, and they shot 49 of those people. And the fiftieth person he said \u2018You go back to your people and you tell them what happened.\u2019 And for 25 years there wasn\u2019t a problem, okay?\u201d\n\nThe story appears to be a hoax spread via e-mail forwards, according to rumor tracker Snopes.com,with no evidence it occurred.\n\nThe moral of the tale, according to Trump: \u201cWe better start getting tough and we better start getting vigilant, and we better start using our heads or we\u2019re not gonna have a country, folks.\u201d\n\nTrump was unimpressed with waterboarding, a banned interrogation tactic that he has pledged to bring back against suspected terrorists, and supplement with far worse forms of abuse.\n\n\u201cIs it torture or not? It\u2019s so borderline,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like minimal, minimal, minimal torture.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2016/02/trump_goes_full_visigoth_in_last_south_carolina_rally.html", "image": "http://www.americanthinker.com/assets/images/at-painter-og-image.png", "title": "Blog: Trump goes full Visigoth in last South Carolina rally"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "\u201cIt\u2019s like minimal, minimal, minimal torture.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m really good at the trade,\u201d the billionaire told a crowd of thousands.\n\u201cI\u2019m really good at the borders.\u201dThe standout topic, however, was terrorism and national security.\nDonald Trump closed his South Carolina campaign on Friday with a rambling speech highlighted by a giddy, almost childlike, enthusiasm for torturing and summarily executing the suspected enemies of America in the name of safety.\n\u201cHe took fifty bullets, and he dipped them in pig\u2019s blood,\u201d Trump said."}
