That article is Andy McCarthy\u2019s \"Drawing an Al-Qaeda Red Line\" over at NRO. What\u2019s so good about it? Several things.\n\nItem: Andy calls attention to the enormous hypocrisy on the part of the Obama administration about Assad.\n\nOr maybe it\u2019s not \u201chypocrisy,\u201d but bumbling inconsistently, which when translated to the stage of world diplomacy equals stunning incompetence. Remember, this is an administration that just a few short years ago\n\n-- reopened diplomatic ties with Syria.\n\n-- Hillary Clinton called Assad a \u201creformer\u201d (no where near as dangerous as that hapless chap who made the anti-Muslim internet video and who was sent to federal prison for . . . for what? Jay-walking? Failing to abate a smoking chimney? Violating the terms of his parole? Something that for people who do not attract the ire of the president merits a stern talking-to?)\n\n-- John \u201creporting for duty\u201d Kerry and his wife were photographed having an intimate dinner with Dr. & Mrs. Assad, the \u201cwildly democratic\u201d couple Vogue celebrated in a puff piece just a couple of years ago.\n\nIt was all part of Obama\u2019s love-thy-Muslim-brother initiative. Bang! Burka Burka Mohammed Jihad blows up another church, mows down 13 fellow soldiers, wounding another 30, at a Texas army base, detonates homemade IEDs at a road race in Boston, murders a U.S. ambassador and three other Americans at a U.S. diplomatic mission in some African hellhole, etcetera, very much etcetera. Who\u2019s to blame? \u201cViolent extremists,\u201d the president\u2019s favorite bad guys. Not \u201cMuslim violent extremists,\u201d just your ordinary, run-of-the-mill extremist \u2014 please let it be a white, male, Christian, gun-toting, tea-party extremist.\n\nBottom line: what\u2019s happening in Syria is the latest assault \u2014 the salt in the fields, as it were \u2014 on the establishment narrative about the Muslim world.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing: from a certain distance and in a certain light Obama looks like an Important Person, the president of the United States, leader of the free (or at least formerly free) world, just as John Kerry looks (well, sort of looks) like something more than an insufferable prig and blowhard.\n\nBut take a closer look. You see that they are both completely out of their depth. Obama jets around on Air Force One. He spends tens of millions of dollars of taxpayer money on an African adventure for himself and his family while closing the White House to school tours because of the sequester. He swaggers just like he\u2019s a big deal, but here\u2019s the rub: the least-experienced president in the the history of the republic, the man whom nobody knew, the guy whose college transcripts we can\u2019t see, whose legislative record was one long evasive \u201cPresent,\u201d whose repellent racialist pandering has set race relations back decades in this country, whose Alinskyite demonize-your-opponents radicalism has further poisoned the character of American politics: this mountebank has succeeded mightily in fulling his promise of \u201cfundamentally transforming the United States of America,\u201d making us poorer, less secure, less free, and less influential than we were when he came to office. He was the man who was supposed to repair the damage done to U.S. prestige by that evil cowboy George W. Bush=Hitler (that\u2019s just fine, calling Bush Hitler, but just try wearing an Obama mask if you\u2019re a clown and see what happens). How\u2019s that working out? Obama was also the fellow who, when not making the oceans recede and healing the plant, was going to work miracles in the U.S. economy, take care of Julia cradle-to-grave, and help enact a 2000-page monstrosity that will go down in infamy, before it goes down to repeal, as ObamaCare. It\u2019s all in shambles now, isn\u2019t it? You can tell how serious the damage is by this first: Obama actually cancelled a fund-raising event the other day -- yes, really. Why? Because his support in Congress for an attack on Syria had gone wobbly. When Ambassador Chris Stevens and three men from his security detail were murdered last September 11 (September 11, mind you), the first thing Obama did was fly to Las Vegas for a fund-raiser. That\u2019s what he means by \u201cleading from behind.\u201d It\u2019s what you or I call \u201cabdicating responsibility.\u201d One of the great things about Andy\u2019s column is that it highlights the discrepancy between the confused reality of the Obama administration and its well-oiled public face.\n\nHere\u2019s an interesting question: if Obama does not bomb Syria, will John Kerry survive as secretary of State? As Andy points out, in his congressional testimony, \u201cKerry was desperately trying to portray the \u2018rebels\u2019 as predominantly \u2018moderate.\u2019\u201d What\u2019s his definition of \u201cmoderate\u201d? He didn\u2019t actually say, but here\u2019s the reality:\n\n[T]he Obama Left and the GOP\u2019s McCain wing are applying Washington\u2019s lunatic definition of \u201cmoderate.\u201d By this thinking, the Islamic ummah is divided into two camps: an al-Qaeda fringe in one, and in the other the teeming millions of \u201cmoderate,\u201d tolerant, peace-loving \u201cdemocracy\u201d activists. In this fantasy, the Muslim Brotherhood \u2014 whose name the Beltway strains to avoid uttering in discussions of Syria \u2014 is moderate . . . and never you mind the bloody catastrophe the Brothers have wrought in nearby Egypt over the last few weeks and months. In truth, the Brotherhood is an implacably Islamic-supremacist organization that is \u201cmoderate\u201d only by comparison with al-Qaeda, and, even then, only if we are talking about al-Qaeda\u2019s methodology of full-time savagery \u2014 the Brothers are part-timers who, unlike al-Qaeda, think violent jihad is just one item on the sharia-installation menu. As far as ideology goes \u2014 i.e., the imperative that sharia be installed \u2014 the two are on exactly the same page. If anything, the Brotherhood\u2019s influence over the \u201coppositionists\u201d is even greater than al-Qaeda\u2019s. The Brothers are the antithesis of moderate. They are anti-American (though they\u2019ll happily take our help before using it against us), anti-democratic (though they\u2019ll happily hold popular elections in Muslim-majority countries), and rabidly anti-Semitic.\n\nSo here\u2019s the question: just whom are we fighting for?", "article_metadata": {"page-title": "The Single Best Article I Have Read on Syria | Roger\u2019s Rules", "pinterest": "nopin", "og": {"site_name": "Roger\u2019s Rules", "description": "Or maybe it\u2019s not \u201chypocrisy,\u201d but bumbling inconsistently, which when translated to the stage of world diplomacy equals stunning incompetence.", "title": "The Single Best Article I Have Read on Syria", "url": "https://pjmedia.com/rogerkimball/2013/9/7/the-single-best-article-i-have-read-on-syria/", "image": "https://pajamasmed.hs.llnwd.net/e1/user-content/4/files/2012/12/obama_whisper_silence_thumbnail_12-12-12-1.jpg", "updated_time": 1464069905, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Or maybe it\u2019s not \u201chypocrisy,\u201d but bumbling inconsistently, which when translated to the stage of world diplomacy equals stunning incompetence.", "title": "The Single Best Article I Have Read on Syria", "url": "https://pjmedia.com/rogerkimball/2013/9/7/the-single-best-article-i-have-read-on-syria/", "image": "https://pajamasmed.hs.llnwd.net/e1/user-content/4/files/2012/12/obama_whisper_silence_thumbnail_12-12-12-1.jpg", "site": "@PJMedia_com", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "The Single Best Article I Have Read on Syria | Roger\u2019s Rules", "pinterestDescription": "The Single Best Article I Have Read on Syria", "fb": {"app_id": 149848758413844}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1678\"", "article_summary": "The Single Best Article I Have Read on SyriaWhere by \u201cSyria\u201d I mean our response to the civil war in Syria, i.e., efforts by terrorist thugs (the \u201crebels,\u201d freedom fighters, etc.)\nNot \u201cMuslim violent extremists,\u201d just your ordinary, run-of-the-mill extremist \u2014 please let it be a white, male, Christian, gun-toting, tea-party extremist.\nIn this fantasy, the Muslim Brotherhood \u2014 whose name the Beltway strains to avoid uttering in discussions of Syria \u2014 is moderate .\nAs Andy points out, in his congressional testimony, \u201cKerry was desperately trying to portray the \u2018rebels\u2019 as predominantly \u2018moderate.\u2019\u201d What\u2019s his definition of \u201cmoderate\u201d?\nHere\u2019s an interesting question: if Obama does not bomb Syria, will John Kerry survive as secretary of State?"}
