(snip)\n\n\u201cThe main forces behind this movement are fanatics who actively seek to eliminate Israel. Unfortunately, they are occasionally joined by fools who naively believe that in promoting BDS, they are advancing peace between Israelis and Palestinians,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201c[T]he fanatics and the fools are simply promoting a new anti-Semitism\u2026.\n\nThe latest example of this, he said, was the EU\u2019s recent move to specially label products made by Jews in the West Bank, east Jerusalem and the Golan Heights. Despite the more than 200 other international territorial disputes, the EU decided to label only Jewish-made products, the ambassador wrote. (snip)\n\nDermer called the EU singling out of Israel \u201call the more shameful\u201d because \u201cIsrael upholds the highest democratic values in the darkest region on earth and while facing threats faced by no other nation.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn response to this effort to cast a beacon of freedom, tolerance and decency as a pariah state, I have decided this holiday season to send you products that were made in Judea, Samaria and the Golan Heights. I hope you will enjoy them,\u201d the ambassador wrote.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2015/12/the_perfect_christmas_gift_for_idiots_and_fools.html", "image": "http://www.americanthinker.com/images/bucket/2015-12/195790_5_.png", "title": "Blog: The perfect Christmas gift for idiots and fools"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Unfortunately, they are occasionally joined by fools who naively believe that in promoting BDS, they are advancing peace between Israelis and Palestinians,\u201d he wrote.\nDespite the more than 200 other international territorial disputes, the EU decided to label only Jewish-made products, the ambassador wrote.\n(snip)\u201cThe main forces behind this movement are fanatics who actively seek to eliminate Israel.\n\u201c[T]he fanatics and the fools are simply promoting a new anti-Semitism\u2026.\nI hope you will enjoy them,\u201d the ambassador wrote."}
