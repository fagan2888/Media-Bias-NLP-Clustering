The host spent several minutes trying to explain himself, through various circumlocutions, then finally gave up. \"You know what,\" he said finally, \"there are 24 hours in a day and you have to fill them. Sometimes you say stupid shit.\"\n\nThat conversation came to mind several times while I was reading GQ's new profile of CNN's Don Lemon. Lemon, the journalist Taffy Brodesser-Akner writes, \"has become associated with what might politely be called missteps, like asking an Islamic scholar if he supports the terrorist group ISIS, or declaring on the scene at Ferguson that there's the smell of marijuana in the air, 'obviously.' This is the guy who asked if a black hole could be responsible for the disappearance of Flight MH370; who asked one of Bill Cosby's alleged rape victims why she didn't stop the attack by, as he put it, 'the using of the teeth.'\"\n\nBrodesser-Akner is ultimately sympathetic to Lemon \u2014 \"I went and watched those clips again, and it turns out none of them are quite as dumb as advertised\" \u2014 and to the plight of cable news hosts in general: \"Very few of us have our conversations laid bare every single night. Hardly any of us are being recorded for stupid-thing-we-said Vine posterity. ... And remember, this is cable, not network news. Lemon's directive in many cases is to get up there and talk. On ratings-hungry CNN, there is virtually nothing you can say that is worse than silence.\"\n\nThe most pervasive criticism of cable news is that it's boring. And yet one feature of the Twitter age is that we \u2014 journalists, news consumers, whoever \u2014 spend so much time beating up on people for saying \"stupid shit\" that we end up encouraging cable news to be more boring. Or, as Jon Ronson writes in his new book, we are \u201ccreating a world where the smartest way to survive is to be bland.\u201d Sixteen different sites pull a video of some errant remark and put it under clicky headlines. Twitter users start calling for heads to roll. Readers post and email the links to their friends, asking, \"Can you believe what Don Lemon just said?\"\n\nOf course, you probably can believe what Don Lemon just said, because people say stupid shit to each other all the time. The problem is that, despite living in a world where the majority of television programming is stupid on purpose, many people still believe that their news anchors should be Murrow or Cronkite. And the problem with that is that Murrow and Cronkite were boring.\n\nDon Lemon is ... a little less boring. Which is why he's beating MSNBC's Lawrence O'Donnell in the ratings. It's also why he's getting profiled in GQ, and why CNN President Jeff Zucker is probably quite pleased with all the press \u2014 positive and negative. \"There's certainly a lot of interest in Don Lemon, and that's a good thing for Don and for CNN,\" Zucker tells Brodesser-Akner. \"You know, Don is a little bit of a lightning rod. Frankly, we needed a little bit of lightning.\"\n\nCable news, generally speaking, needs lightning. It needs something besides sedate news anchors, partisan blowhards and purveyors of conventional wisdom. It needs people who laugh and are personable and who say stupid shit.\n\nBrodesser-Akner writes that Lemon \"may not be the steady, infallible news anchor America needs right now. But he sure feels like the anchor we deserve.\" I'm actually not so sure we deserve him. With all our faux-outrage, I feel like we deserve boredom.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "<p>Sometime during the 2012 presidential campaign, I called up a popular cable news host to ask him if he wanted to comment on some controversial remark he had made on air.
