Detroit, MI

Problems with exploding Takata air bag inflators continue to spread to more vehicles, this time hitting a small number of 2015 General Motors cars and SUVs.



Documents posted Saturday by U.S. safety regulators say GM is recalling more than 400 vehicles because the side air bag inflators could rupture and send shrapnel into drivers and passengers.



The recall means that the air bag problems are growing to more newer models and into side air bags. Previously the problem was limited mainly to older vehicles and front air bags. Eight people have been killed worldwide because of the faulty inflators and more than 100 have been hurt.



The latest recall covers certain 2015 Chevrolet Equinox, Malibu and Camaro vehicles as well as the Buick LaCrosse, Cadillac XTS and GMC Terrain.
