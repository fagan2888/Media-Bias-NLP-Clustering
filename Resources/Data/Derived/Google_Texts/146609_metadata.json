Do you find it at least encouraging that it is tilted to fish, particularly catfish?\u201d\n\n\u201cI find it not encouraging at all,\u201d the doctor responded, \u201cbecause basically what we\u2019re trying to do now is take a whole \u2018nother industry \u2014 the farm industry \u2014 and put them also completely under the thumb of the government. It\u2019s a systematic thing. \u2026 I hope people are able to see what\u2019s going on, be able to look at the big picture here. There\u2019s an utter contempt for the intelligence of the people, the things that this administration is doing.\u201d\n\n\u201cHey doctor, not just this administration,\u201d Cavuto retorted. \u201cWith all respect, sir, Republicans signed onto this thing. \u2026 I\u2019m wondering as you \u2014 someone who says conservatives have to stand on principle and go line-by-line through this stuff \u2014 when you see the shenanigans on the part of both parties to keep foisting this stuff under the guise of a farm bill that sounds good, how different is that from just wasting gazillions of dollars on a health-care law that\u2019s not panning out?\u201d\n\nCarson took aim at his own party. \u201cI have to confess that both parties have people who believe in big-government control,\u201d he noted. \u201cI want people to start vocalizing, in a tangible way, their dissent, so that we can present this to Congress and we can get the kind of people in there who have the courage that is necessary to stand up to the abuses.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe abuses come from both parties,\u201d he continued. \u201cSo what we\u2019re fighting against here \u2014 it\u2019s not Republicans and Democrats. We\u2019re fighting [between] those who believe in the freedom of the people \u2014 and that this country is for, of, and by the people \u2014 and those who feel that it\u2019s for, of, and by the government.\u201d\n\nFollow Brendan on Twitter\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
