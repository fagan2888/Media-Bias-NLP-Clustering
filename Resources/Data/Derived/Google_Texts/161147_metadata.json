Since Carson has actually been saying stuff on video for a good quarter-century, it is becoming increasingly difficult to keep up with both the unearthed and the real-time cray. With all of this to choose from, it\u2019s absolutely confounding that the media has chosen Carson\u2019s fish story about West Point as their hill to die on.\n\nAs a public service to my readers, I\u2019ve decided to gather all of it in one place, or as much as the internet and I can come up with. For liberals and Trump fans, consider this a trove from which to throw together your own homemade anti-Carson ads. For conservatives and Carson supporters, just throw these links into a Facebook post entitled \u201cHow the Media Smears Ben Carson By Playing Things He Said Exactly How He Said Them With His Own Mouth,\u201d since we\u2019re only including things you can hear, not things by \u201creporters\u201d that you have to \u201cread.\u201d I\u2019ve arranged them with those you\u2019re less likely to have seen already first, then down to the more well-known ones.\n\nEnjoy, and share with your friends!\n\nShit Ben Carson Says: The Complete Collection", "article_metadata": {"description": "Think of this as The Compleat Beatles, for wingnuts.", "generator": "WordPress 2016.21", "og": {"image": "http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/carson-slideshow-300x2011.jpg", "title": "Sh*t Ben Carson Says: The Complete Collection"}, "twitter": {"description": "Think of this as The Compleat Beatles, for wingnuts.", "title": "Sh*t Ben Carson Says: The Complete Collection", "image": "http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/carson-slideshow-300x2011.jpg", "creator": "@TommyXtopher", "site": "@mediaite", "card": "summary"}, "NextGEN": "1.5.5", "date": "2015-11-07T14:18:54+00:00", "keywords": "columnists,online,opinion,print,tv", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.5, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Shit Ben Carson Says: The Complete Collection\nSince his sharp rise in the Republican primary polls, retired neurosurgeon and self-styled worst knife-fighter in the world Ben Carson has become well-known for saying lots of crazy, unfounded, or just plain weird things.\nSince Carson has actually been saying stuff on video for a good quarter-century, it is becoming increasingly difficult to keep up with both the unearthed and the real-time cray.\nFor liberals and Trump fans, consider this a trove from which to throw together your own homemade anti-Carson ads.\nWith all of this to choose from, it\u2019s absolutely confounding that the media has chosen Carson\u2019s fish story about West Point as their hill to die on."}
