The study is published in the Journal of the American Medical Association.\n\nThey looked at the stage of the cancer at diagnosis, in particular focusing on women whose cancers were found at the earliest stage, when the cancers were less than two centimetres.\n\nWith some types of breast cancer, the earlier the tumour is found the more likely it is that the woman will survive. So looking only at cancers diagnosed early should have eliminated the survival differences one might have expected if one racial group\u2019s problems accessing care meant their cancers were typically found later.\n\nThe researchers saw that black women were less likely to be diagnosed with Stage 1 cancer than women of Japanese heritage. But even if they were first diagnosed with a Stage 1 tumour, black women were more likely to die from the cancer than white women or women of Japanese ethnicity.\n\nFor one thing, the cancer was more likely to have spread at the time of diagnosis, even though the tumours were small. And black women were more likely to have the hardest form of the disease to treat, known as triple negative breast cancer.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s more likely to have already spread when it\u2019s detected. And if it hasn\u2019t spread when it\u2019s detected, it\u2019s more likely to spread in the future. Both things are true, compared to a white woman,\u201d Dr. Narod said.\n\nAn editorial that accompanied the study suggested the survival gap will be closed only when large numbers of women from minority groups are included in studies aimed at finding the genomic basis of different types of breast cancers.\n\nEditorial co-author Olufunmilayo Olopade called the paper \u201cfundamentally important,\u201d saying she has been pressing the breast cancer research field to look at racial differences for some time.\n\n\u201cYes, you can talk about access [to care],\u201d said Dr. Olopade, director of the Center for Clinical Cancer Genetics at the University of Chicago Medical School.\n\n\u201cBut if you treat all cancers the same in all populations, you are not recognizing the biological differences that happen in human beings.\u201d\n\nShe said the advent of registries like the one Dr. Narod and his colleagues mined finally gives researchers granular data to study. \u201cThe data are speaking to us in very different ways than we had been accustomed to because they now break everybody down by their race and their ethnicity.\u201d\n\nBut Otis Brawley, chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society, suggested the differences in survival outcomes may not be down to race but rather socio-economic factors.\n\nHe said girls who are born into poor families have poorer diets, are more likely to gain weight in childhood and are more likely to start menstruating early. Early start of menstruation is linked to an increased risk of breast cancer.\n\nDr. Brawley said studies done in Scotland \u2014 in an all-white cohort \u2014 showed that women who were economically deprived in childhood had higher rates of breast cancer later in life and were more likely to develop breast cancer at a younger age than women who were more economically advantaged.\n\nHe said the American Cancer Society would expect to see similar survival outcomes among poor white women as among poor black women \u2014 and even middle- and upper-income black women who grew up poor.\n\n\u201cI believe it\u2019s race for social reasons, and not race for biologic reasons,\u201d Dr. Brawley said. \u201cThere are a lot of lifestyle factors that actually do affect biology and change biology.\u201d\n\nDr. Olopade disputed Dr. Brawley\u2019s position, saying there are many poor Asian immigrants in the United States but their breast cancer outcomes are not on a par with those of black women.\n\nDr. Narod said that among all racial or ethnic groups, the seven-year survival rates were good when breast cancers were detected when the tumour was under two centimetres in size.\n\nFor women of Japanese heritage, the survival rate was nearly 99 per cent. For white women, it was 95 per cent, and for black women it was 91 per cent, he said.\n\n\u201cThose are all pretty good, but there\u2019s a hell of a big difference between a 1-per-cent chance of dying and a \u2026 9-per-cent chance of dying,\u201d Dr. Narod said. \u201cThat\u2019s an extraordinary difference from that point of view.\u201d\n\nReport Typo/Error", "article_metadata": {"website": "http://www.theglobeandmail.com", "application-artifactId": "gam-webapp", "application-version": "14.0.339", "description": "Black women found to have higher risk of dying than white or Japanese women, even when access to health care is equal", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=429228415", "og": {"site_name": "The Globe and Mail", "description": "Black women found to have higher risk of dying than white or Japanese women, even when access to health care is equal", "title": "Race may influence a woman's breast cancer outcome, study finds", "url": "http://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/health-and-fitness/health/race-influences-breast-cancer-outcome-study-finds/article22426124/", "image": {"width": 400, "secure_url": "https://sec.images.theglobeandmail.com/media/www/images/flag/gam-square.png", "type": "image/png", "identifier": "http://static.theglobeandmail.ca/d0a/life/health-and-fitness/health/article19309175.ece/ALTERNATES/w620/web-he-cancer24nw1.jpg", "height": 400}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Black women found to have higher risk of dying than white or Japanese women, even when access to health care is equal", "creator": "@globeandmail", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "tgam://article/22426124", "iphone": "tgam://article/22426124"}, "country": "CA", "name": {"ipad": "The Globe And Mail", "iphone": "The Globe And Mail"}, "id": {"ipad": 429228415, "iphone": 429228415}}, "site": "@globeandmail", "card": "summary", "account_id": 1512948019}, "robots": "noarchive", "last-modified": "2015-01-13 07:15:55 EST", "fb": {"app_id": 126045934076200}, "location": "Canada", "application-contextName": "globeandmail", "keywords": "Journal of the American Medical Association;women;health care;black women;race;breast cancer;health;", "article": {"onpage": 1, "engagement": "true", "comments": "false", "pages": 1, "type": "news", "id": 22426124}, "viewport": "width=device-width", "identifier-URL": "http://www.theglobeandmail.com"}, "article_summary": "For white women, it was 95 per cent, and for black women it was 91 per cent, he said.\nDr. Narod and his co-authors analyzed data on nearly 375,000 women with invasive breast cancer that was diagnosed between 2004 and 2011.\nEarly start of menstruation is linked to an increased risk of breast cancer.\nAnd black women were more likely to have the hardest form of the disease to treat, known as triple negative breast cancer.\nWith some types of breast cancer, the earlier the tumour is found the more likely it is that the woman will survive."}
