Some place the blame squarely on our seasonal extremes.\n\n\"It's hard to get good veggies, especially in winter,\" said Shawn Goodchild of Lake Park, Minn., who picked up fresh herbs and vegetables last week at the Northern Plains Farmers Market, in the west parking lot of West Acres in Fargo.\n\n\"We're both actually probably in the low tier,\" said his wife, Heather Hundt.\n\nT-Roy Anderson of West Fargo, also perusing the brightly colored produce that day, said he thinks he comes close to eating the recommended amount of veggies.\n\n\"But throw some meat in there too, right?\" Anderson said with a laugh.\n\nIt might be an availability problem, but it also comes down to upbringing and habit.\n\n\"We do tend to be meat and potatoes,\" said Kim Lipetzky, public health nutritionist at Fargo Cass Public Health.\n\nBut the landscape is improving on all fronts, Lipetzky said, with the growing popularity of greenhouses, community gardens and community supported agriculture or CSAs, where members purchase a share of fresh produce from a regional farmer.\n\nHer department is also part of a new program that aims to ensure all residents have access to safe, nutritious and affordable foods.\n\nThe Cass Clay Food Systems Initiative will investigate ways to support smaller growers who supply produce to farmers markets and CSAs and make sure the right policies are in place to help those entities thrive.\n\nLipetzky offered these tips for increasing fruit and vegetable consumption:\n\n\u2022 Get involved in a community garden or CSA or shop at a local farmers market.\n\n\u2022 Add vegetables to everything, from pasta mixes to pizza and sandwiches.\n\n\u2022 Cut fruits and vegetables up shortly after purchasing, so they're ready to eat.\n\n\u2022 Advocate for more fruits and vegetables in the workplace and social settings.\n\n\u2022 Check with NDSU Extension on how to preserve fresh vegetables.\n\n\u2022 Eat frozen and canned vegetables in the winter, as they can be just as nutritious.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "News,Health,Vegetables,weight,CDC,Fruits,North Dakota,Minnesota", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Robin Huebner", "og":
