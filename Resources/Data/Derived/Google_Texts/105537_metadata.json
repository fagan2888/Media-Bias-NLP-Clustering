They always do about this time of the year.\n\nWhy?\n\nHe doesn\u2019t play the game as if he doesn\u2019t care. On the contrary, in a season that has gone down the tubes quickly, one where he has clashed intermittently with coach George Karl \u2014 and, at least once, has had good reason to \u2014 he still goes out and gives his team its best chance to win. The Kings have a bad record with him, but they are worse, 2-8, without him.\n\nHe impacts both ends of the court. If he were doing it for a winning team, he would be celebrated.\n\nThis is the point when some will say, \u201cIf he\u2019s so great, he\u2019d lead his team to more victories.\u201d\n\nAll the greats do, right?\n\nThis a roll call of some of his teammates over the years: Tyreke Evans, Francisco Garcia, Samuel Dalembert, Jason Thompson, Marcus Thornton, Jimmer Fredette, Rudy Gay, Chuck Hayes, John Salmons, Derrick Williams, Travis Outlaw and Isaiah Thomas.\n\nMany of those players are very talented. This is not a slight on them. But the fact of the matter is none has been an indispensable cog in winning anything of consequence in the NBA. So why would they be in Sacramento, where the coach changes almost every year, where the general manager changes every couple of years, and where questionable decision after questionable decision is made?\n\nWho wins in that environment?\n\nNobody.\n\nCousins, since he arrived in Sactown as the fifth overall pick in 2010, is nearly the only constant. In six seasons he has had five coaches (including interims) and three general managers. He has seen five lottery picks for the Kings. He has had countless teammates constantly rotating through the turnstiles. It\u2019s impossible to get comfortable with that much change and upheaval, let alone thrive. Show me great players doing championship-level things and I\u2019ll show you a stable organization making it all possible.\n\nWe\u2019re still talking about someone in the top 12 in the league in player efficiency ratings \u2014 higher than Damian Lillard, Blake Griffin and LaMarcus Aldridge \u2014 and higher than his former teammate who became an all-star in Boston, Thomas. Cousins is an elite player and an effective player. But put him in a tumultuous situation, and he\u2019ll be volatile.\n\nHe has worked on calming down and not flying off the handle at the drop of a dime and, by and large, he doesn\u2019t anymore. He does lead the league in technical fouls. He\u2019ll have the occasional eruption, but what team doesn\u2019t need players with that kind of passion? If you have to live with 15 technical fouls in the 58 games he has played into get 27.3 points, 11.4 rebounds, 3.3 assists, 1.4 blocks and 1.5 steals per game, wouldn\u2019t you do it?\n\nAnd as traditional a center as he is, dominating on the block, Cousins is also a \u201cstretch five.\u201d His 34 percent shooting from the 3-point line says so. If he played for the Nuggets, he\u2019d rank fifth on the team in that statistic among players who have played in at least 55 games.\n\nIn defense of Cousins, he shouldn\u2019t be expected to be happy in a losing culture. But he doesn\u2019t mail it in. He plays. He plays well. He doesn\u2019t accept games and nonsense from a coach or an organization and isn\u2019t afraid to voice it. And that\u2019s fine.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t have the look of a player failing an organization.\n\nThis has every bit the look of an organization that to this point has failed him.\n\nChristopher Dempsey: cdempsey@denverpost.com or @dempseypost\n\nSpotlight on \u2026\n\nStephen Curry, G, Golden State\n\nThough the months change, one thing in the NBA hasn\u2019t \u2014 Stephen Curry\u2019s dominance on a weekly basis. In the thick of a battle with San Antonio to finish with the West\u2019s No. 1 seed, Curry is The Denver Post\u2019s player of the week.\n\nWhat\u2019s up: In four games Curry averaged 31.8 points, 6.3 assists, 5.8 rebounds and 1.0 steals. He shot 53.5 percent from the field, including 50 percent from the 3-point line, and he did all of this in just over 32 minutes per game. The Warriors won all four contests.\n\nBackground: This is how you average 31 points in just 32 minutes per game \u2014 by being a plus-21.3 when you\u2019re on the court. That\u2019s an astronomical number, meaning Golden State simply obliterated the opponent when he was on the court. And when you take care of business in the first three quarters, you can sit out of most of the fourth. Curry\u2019s best game of the bunch was against the Dallas Mavericks on Friday. He logged 31 points, 10 assists and nine rebounds, and he had just one turnover.\n\nDempsey\u2019s take: If another player gets a first-place MVP vote this season, well, let\u2019s just say he shouldn\u2019t. And that includes LeBron James, as great a player as he is. No player has been as outstanding as Curry this season, and it\u2019s not even close. He has been the most dominant player in games against other dominant players. And his Warriors are on track to break the single-season victories record.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Dempsey: DeMarcus Cousins\u2019 volatility is outpaced by ability", "title": "Dempsey: DeMarcus Cousins\u2019 volatility is outpaced by ability", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/03/19/dempsey-demarcus-cousins-volatility-is-outpaced-by-ability/", "image": {"width": 512, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg", "height": 512}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-03-19T21:26:18+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-23T02:37:21+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Christopher Dempsey"}, "article_summary": "He\u2019ll have the occasional eruption, but what team doesn\u2019t need players with that kind of passion?\nWhat\u2019s up: In four games Curry averaged 31.8 points, 6.3 assists, 5.8 rebounds and 1.0 steals.\nHe doesn\u2019t accept games and nonsense from a coach or an organization and isn\u2019t afraid to voice it.\nCousins, since he arrived in Sactown as the fifth overall pick in 2010, is nearly the only constant.\nNo player has been as outstanding as Curry this season, and it\u2019s not even close."}
