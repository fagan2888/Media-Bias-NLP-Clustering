OLIVIA S. MITCHELL: Many parents and financial experts tend to be dead-set against young people borrowing from their 401(k) retirement accounts. After all, that money is intended for your old age, not for a quick trip to Hawaii when the cold weather gets you down. So does it ever make sense?

Because most 401(k) money is contributed pretax, both tax and employer rules shape when you can get at the cash and how the loans must be repaid. Tax law allows you to borrow only $50,000 or half your account value, whichever is less, and you must repay the loan plus interest, usually in the form of payroll deductions. And it’s up to your firm to decide if it will permit any loans at all, how much the interest rate will be, and how many loans you can take at once. But most critically, if you do borrow from your plan and then leave your job, you must repay the entire loan at once. If you don’t, you’re on the hook for income taxes on the loan outstanding, along with a 10% penalty (if you are younger than 59½).

Today most of us with 401(k)s can access our retirement money via plan loans, and the interest rates charged tend to be very low–much below credit-card and most student-loan rates. So if your credit card’s melting, it could make sense to substitute a cheaper 401(k) loan.

Yet, as usual, life’s not that simple. Our new research study shows that one-fifth of all participants have loans outstanding, and happily, nine in 10 people do repay. Yet almost 90% of the borrowers who leave their jobs (including those laid off) do not repay their loans, resulting in $1 billion of revenue handed over to the government annually from workers paying penalty fees. That is money they will surely miss in retirement!
