Cisco Systems Inc. said it would stop selling data-storage hardware, a business that it entered with its $415 million acquisition of Whiptail in 2013.

New Jersey startup Whiptail specialized in equipment that stores data on chips known as flash memory rather than disk drives, a technology that has attracted many large and small competitors. Cisco CSCO, -0.07% which had previously moved beyond networking gear to server systems, had said Whiptail’s technology could help boost the performance of those systems.

But Cisco said Friday it would discontinue the resulting line of products, known as Invicta, as part of recent efforts to narrow its focus on the most promising businesses. A Cisco spokeswoman said some employees would lose their jobs, but she declined to disclose how many people would be affected.

Cisco entered the storage market despite the risk of angering longtime partners that sold competing hardware. Tim Stammers, a senior analyst at 451 Research, said the company tried to use other terms than “data storage” when discussing Invicta, a tactic he called a “silly dance.”

The Invicta products also suffered from technical problems, Mr. Stammers noted. The Cisco spokeswoman said the company recently held shipments for several months while it addressed the issues.
