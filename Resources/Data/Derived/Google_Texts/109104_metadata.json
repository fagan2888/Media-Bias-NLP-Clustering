There are two ways to go from here: several thousand feet up, eventually summiting the 14,048-foot Handies Peak, or several thousand feet down in one of the vehicles beckoning those too exhausted or medically unable to continue \u2014 a 30-minute drop into town where a warm bed and a hot shower await.\n\nBy nightfall here, heavy rain and brilliant flashes of lightning crack across the sky. Dale Garland, the run\u2019s respected veteran director, radios down to Silverton to request a weather service forecast from NOAA, worried about having groups of runners and pacers \u2014 those who help weary and delirious competitors find their way along the course \u2014 stuck at high altitudes with little shelter. It will be several more hours until the storm blows over.\n\nSome will forge ahead, but many will wait out the storm in two small tents, drinking hot soup, consuming food to restore energy, sleeping until it is safe to continue. Sit down, and you may not get up.\n\n\u201cBeware the chair,\u201d hardened veterans of ultrarunning say.\n\nBut this is no worry for K\u00edlian Jornet Burgada, the Spanish super endurance athlete who three weeks ago summited Alaska\u2019s Denali in record time, and by the next checkpoint at Burrows will be leading one of the most difficult endurance runs in the world by 16 minutes. He is one of three who made it over Handies before the worst of the storm.\n\nThe course record set in 2008 by Kyle Skaggs stood at 23 hours, 23 minutes \u2014 and now it was in jeopardy. Sure enough, at 4:41 a.m., well before the sun rose, Jornet came trotting through Silverton with his pacer, Anna Frost, and knelt down to kiss \u201cThe Rock\u201d \u2014 the stone that runners must peck to officially finish the run. A few dozen passionate spectators and media had gathered under the street lamps to witness history.\n\nFinal time: 22:41:35. Someone shouts out from the crowd, \u201cAre you a mountain goat?\u201d Laughter.\n\n\u201cThe record is a thing you think about during the race,\u201d Jornet said. \u201cBut I was mostly thinking about finishing the race. It\u2019s difficult to finish a 100-mile race always.\u201d\n\nJornet had just obliterated one of the most revered records in North American ultradistance running in the most competitive field in the run\u2019s history, and now he appeared to have done it with ease. Had he started faster early on, it\u2019s likely he would have gone under 22 hours. To conserve energy in the early parts of the race, he briskly walked the uphills and ran the flats and downhills, he said. In the late miles, his lead grew as he and his pacer ran the uphills.\n\n\u201cThe altitude affects everybody,\u201d Jornet said, sitting in a chair answering questions in front of the Hardrock. \u201cYou can\u2019t run as fast as you do lower. But it didn\u2019t affect me any more than normal.\u201d\n\nAt 26, Jornet is the most accomplished endurance athlete of his generation, observers of this sport say, smashing long-held endurance records with such breathtaking aplomb that it\u2019s a wonder he has much left to accomplish. He called Hardrock the last of the major ultramarathons on his list to complete and win.\n\nHe didn\u2019t rule out a return next year \u2014 where he will be offered one of two automatic slots in the 140-person field \u2014 to run the course in the opposite direction (it switches each year).\n\n\u201cI need to do the other side now,\u201d he said.\n\nThe run, now in its 21st year, began Friday at 6 a.m. with 140 people and has a cutoff time of 48 hours after the start. Its difficulty is due to altitude, steep climbs and remoteness. \u201cWild and Tough,\u201d the race\u2019s slogan declares.\n\nTales of courageous pursuit of the finish abounded. Runner Jason Koop was caught in chilling rain after Grouse Gulch and suffered hypothermia, Garland said. A group of campers near Handies Peak ushered him into their tent to warm him, and he continued, but he had to drop at the Sherman Aid Station at Mile 72. A night rescue via helicopter in bad weather would have been impossible.\n\nTimothy Olson, one of the top athletes coming in, suffered an uneasy stomach throughout, unable to keep down any food for energy other than \u201cFritos and Sprite\u201d for half the race. He willed himself to finish 12th, knelt before the Hardrock, bowed his head, took a deep breath, and kissed the rock face. He finished in 30:18:45.\n\n\u201cThat was some work,\u201d he said. \u201cI did it. That was the goal coming in \u2014 to kiss The Rock. I just had a lot of things go wrong. I threw up everything \u2014 a lot.\u201d\n\nHe was ready to quit after Ouray at Mile 44. It took him an hour and a half to do the next mile. When did he know he was going to finish? \u201cProbably when they kicked me out of Grouse (aid station). The lightning scared the [expletive] out of me.\u201d\n\nJulien Chorier of France, who suffered back problems during the rain and lightning, limped to the finish in second in 25:07:56, missing his goal of finishing under 24 hours.\n\nMany of the race\u2019s top athletes pulled out for various medical issues. Sebastien Chaigneau of France, the defending champion, pulled out at Grouse Gulch aid station for stomach issues. At Mile 87.1, women\u2019s leader Diana Finkel dropped out of the race for the third straight year for reasons that weren\u2019t immediately known. It opened the door for Darcy Piceu Africa \u2014 her main rival \u2014 who finished in 29:49 as the top woman for the third year in a row.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s bittersweet,\u201d Africa said of her win. \u201cI wish Diana could have kept going.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe lightning was close,\u201d she said of the storms. \u201cWe didn\u2019t stop, but we had to squat once. It\u2019s par for the course in the mountains.\u201d\n\nAfter the impromptu news conference, Jornet hung around the finish waiting for others, talking with fans, media and other athletes. He retreated eventually to eat, get a hot shower and sleep (he said he might need only eight hours). After the awards ceremony Sunday, he\u2019ll leave and \u2014 depending on how he recovers \u2014 be ready for a race in Italy by Thursday: a 1-kilometer vertical ascent.\n\nDaniel Petty: dpetty@denverpost.com, 303-954-1081, twitter.com/danielpetty\n\nUpdated July 15 at 3:31 p.m.The following corrected information has been added to this article: Because of an error by a reporter, the name of Kilian Jornet\u2019s pacer was originally misspelled.
