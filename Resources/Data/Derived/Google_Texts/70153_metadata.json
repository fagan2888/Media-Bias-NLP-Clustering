That, of course, is true with the struggle against the Islamic State. But while American presidents sent American troops onto foreign soil in Iraq and Afghanistan, no American GIs will be on the ground in Syria or in the parts of Iraq occupied by the Islamic State.\n\nThere have been other occasions when the United States was in a war without Americans being at war. That is probably true of the Mexican-American War and the Spanish-American War, but of hardly any other conflict. Those two wars involved American soldiers fighting in isolated locales for relatively short periods of war during which there were limited privations at home and, in fact, little evidence of war at home \u2014 besides, of course, the isolated homes where families mourned their wartime losses.\n\nThe Revolutionary War was fought on the East Coast, and the War of 1812 endangered the ports of New England, the capital at Washington and the Great Lakes region. The Civil War had both military and civilian fronts, especially in the border states and in the South, where the devastation was the most severe.\n\nBoth World Wars were such monumental efforts that virtually every family was affected, either by war work or by virtue of having brothers, sisters, fathers or mothers actually deployed abroad or in support roles domestically. The same was true in the conflicts in Korea and Vietnam. Even the so-called Indian wars of the 19th century exposed American civilians, on the frontier at least, to danger and perhaps death, and the target of those military engagements were, by many definitions, Americans.\n\nThe current war involves the vast majority of Americans only if \u2014 and this is what the struggle against the Islamic State is designed to prevent \u2014 our terrorist foes bring the battle to our shores.\n\nThey might, of course, and that is part of the risk of engagement, and maybe even a greater risk of not engaging.\n\nDespite the implicit threat to what is now called the American homeland, the conflicts in the Middle East and central Asia seemed like affairs faraway.\n\nBut the terrorist attacks of 2001 changed more than our outlook; they changed our vocabulary as well. Until 2001, that evocative word \u201chomeland\u201d was customarily applied in the Western Hemisphere to the countries of Americans\u2019 immigrant forebears, rarely to the United States itself, and it was employed far more in fiction than in fighting.\n\nThe president still has vast latitude in his fight against the Islamic State, in part because that fight right now seems popular \u2014 and urgent. Even so, a Congress that has held more than 50 votes on Obamacare \u2014 efforts to repeal or de-fund the measure have become routine in the House \u2014 seems uneasy with intruding on White House prerogatives in national security affairs.\n\nThat may change after this autumn\u2019s midterm congressional elections. But until and unless that happens, congressional uneasiness actually has given the president freer reign, in effect affirming the president\u2019s views of what those White House prerogatives are.\n\nThere are two ironies here.\n\nOne is that Congress, especially the House, is content to let Obama expand the powers of the presidency even as it seeks in other realms to thwart his will.\n\nThe other is that by inaction, Congress seems willing to grant the president broad flexibility in interpreting the authority it has granted earlier.\n\nIn another case of Obama leaning on the very pinions of Bush administration policy that he deplored in order to win the White House \u2014 some of the others were in economic affairs \u2014 the president\u2019s implicit legal defense of his actions has rested on authorizations Bush won more than a decade ago to battle al-Qaida and invade Iraq.\n\nThose authorizations were far more narrow in reality than they are in memory. But, then again, a sense of unreality cloaks everything about America at war in the 21st century.\n\nDavid Shribman is executive editor of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://detne.ws/1uB0OsG", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "This is the paradox of our time: America is in a war, but Americans aren\u2019t at war", "og": {"site_name": "Detroit News", "description": "This is the paradox of our time: America is in a war, but Americans aren\u2019t at war", "title": "America is in a war, but not at war", "url": "http://www.detroitnews.com/story/opinion/editorials/2014/09/23/america-war-isis-terror/16068459/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/detroitnews.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "This is the paradox of our time: America is in a war, but Americans aren\u2019t at war", "creator": "@detroitnews", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/dc5050ae504cf748f055b908e0704654e55d74c4/c=272-0-1528-1256&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/DetroitNews/2014/09/22/isistoon092314.jpg", "title": "ISIS: America's reluctant war", "site": "@detroitnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=904391631", "fb": {"app_id": 175422022549521}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "David Shribman, America, war, ISIS"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fded3d\"", "article_summary": "There have been other occasions when the United States was in a war without Americans being at war.\nThat is probably true of the Mexican-American War and the Spanish-American War, but of hardly any other conflict.\nJeff Koterba cartoon for September 17, 2014 \"ISIS ISIL Islamic Iraq Soldiers\"This is the paradox of our time: The United States is in a war, but Americans aren\u2019t at war.\nAnd we are using the word \u201cwar\u201d because the Obama administration, in a subtle but important rhetorical adjustment, abruptly substituted \u201cat war\u201d for \u201ccounterterrorism\u201d a few days ago.\nThe president still has vast latitude in his fight against the Islamic State, in part because that fight right now seems popular \u2014 and urgent."}
