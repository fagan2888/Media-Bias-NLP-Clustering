(Photo: TRIBUNE PHOTO/LARRY BECKNER)Buy Photo\n\nNearly a year after a prominent Shelby doctor\u2019s access to the county hospital was revoked, the actions taken against Dr. Robert Clary continue to provoke strong opinions on both sides of the controversy.\n\nOn Dec. 17, 2013, board members of Marias Healthcare Services Inc. voted to terminate Clary\u2019s contract with the clinic amid allegations the veteran doctor had repeatedly threatened, intimidated and berated staff, creating a hostile and unsustainable workplace environment at the Shelby physician\u2019s clinic.\n\nSeven weeks later, the county-owned hospital, Marias Medical Center, revoked Clary\u2019s hospital access privileges based upon similar allegations.\n\nOver the past year, Toole County and Marias Medical Center have been named as defendants in at least two Clary-related lawsuits. Clary has established a private medical clinic that now diverts a substantial percentage of former patients away from the financially distressed Marias Medical Center.\n\nThe hospital\u2019s chief executive officer has resigned, Marias Medical Center\u2019s board of trustees has been dissolved and on Wednesday, the Toole County Clerk and Recorder\u2019s Office certified 407 signatures on a petition to recall Toole County Commissioner Allan Underdal. All of it has come as result of the controversy surrounding Clary.\n\nDue to his involvement in ongoing litigation, Clary was advised by his attorney not to comment for this story.\n\nCounty Commission Chairman Ben Ober said the dispute has alienated neighbors and divided families. Several Marias Medical Center trustees have resigned over the past year \u2014 either because they received a threatening phone call or because their business was losing customers. Ober said Clary\u2019s supporters are responsible for most of these retaliatory acts.\n\n\u201cWe had a trustee from Sunburst who has a fertilizer/chemical business,\u201d Ober said. \u201cHe had several people call and cancel their business for the next year. It was a substantial amount of money that he was losing, so he just said \u2018I can\u2019t take any more of this. I\u2019m getting off the board.\u2019\u201d\n\nSupport for doctor\n\nThe fierce loyalty of many of Clary\u2019s patients was demonstrated early on at a Jan. 10 town meeting in Shelby. Roughly 400 people packed into a middle school auditorium to confront the Marias Medical Center board of trustees. The large majority of them expressed outrage that the hospital would even consider revoking Clary\u2019s hospital privileges.\n\n\u201cDr. Clary has served our community for 30-plus years, and I am appalled at the shabby way he has been treated,\u201d an emotional Barb Kohl told the trustees.\n\nNo one has alleged Clary is incompetent or that he has neglected his patients. The sanctions against him are based upon an alleged pattern of abusive and disruptive behavior stretching back many years. Matters came to a head in December 2013 when Clary reportedly told a young, female hospital employee that he would \u201ckill her\u201d if she didn\u2019t fix a problem with a new electronic medical records program. The threat was allegedly witnessed by several other staff members.\n\nMany of Clary\u2019s supporters argue that while the doctor was undoubtedly angry, the threat was never intended to be taken seriously. Some suggest the criticism of Clary is rooted in a generational divide.\n\nAt the time of Clary\u2019s dismissal, several veteran nurses spoke publicly in his support. Some of these have now left employment at Marias Medical Center, citing co-worker intimidation as the reason for their departure. Months later, when it appeared the hospital board was edging toward fully reinstating Clary\u2019s hospital access, a group of approximately 12 health care professionals threatened to take legal action to prevent that eventuality. Most of these were significantly younger than Clary, who is now in his mid-60s.\n\nThe implication is that the younger generation of health care professionals lack the dedication and work ethic of Clary\u2019s generation and are too thin-skinned to accept pointed criticism.\n\n\u201cI truly believe that these ones who were threatening the lawsuit \u2014 Clary was on their case to make them better,\u201d former hospital board trustee Rick Aschim said. \u201cI had several reports from the gals that were leaving \u2014 they admitted that they had been chewed out by Clary, but it was always for the right reasons. It just seems like that newer generation isn\u2019t willing to do that. If it\u2019s shoveling a sidewalk that\u2019s one thing, but if you\u2019re working with meds and things like that and you screw up, that\u2019s life and death.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t grow up in the warm and fuzzy world where you\u2019ve got to be kinder in the way you say things,\u201d said Dwaine Iverson, a Clary supporter who is also in his 60s. \u201cWe\u2019re blunt and to the point, and doing that offends some people. If you could do it over you probably would have said it differently, but in the heat of the moment it\u2019s what you do. To criticize Clary for that, I think is inappropriate.\u201d\n\nBut comments from several of Clary\u2019s former colleagues belie the argument that only younger health care professionals were offended by his behavior. Most declined to be quoted directly, but Drs. Delmar Williams, Dan Raush, Patsy Vargo and advanced practice registered nurses Lori Oltz and Dave Tafford all said they left their practices in Shelby, to a large degree, because of the hostile work environment created by Clary.\n\n\u201cI think this is probably one of the reasons why the clinic (Marias Healthcare Services Inc.) decided to fire him,\u201d Ober said. \u201cThey had this known history of former employees, and when they asked them why they left, several told them \u2018I left because I couldn\u2019t stand to be with Dr. Clary.\u2019\u201d\n\nFinancial health\n\nStaff retention has been a long-standing problem at Marias Medical Center. William Hartley, interim chief executive officer for the hospital, said Marias Medical Center has had 23 different doctors over the past 12 years, and of those only one has chosen to stay in Shelby.\n\nHartley did not suggest that all those departures were due to Clary, but he did say the lack of staff retention was one of a number of factors that has led to a reported $1.5 million deficit at Marias Medical Center.\n\n\u201cYou have got to adapt and be able to work with people \u2014 that\u2019s a constant change we\u2019ve all got to deal with,\u201d Hartley said. \u201cIn any business you\u2019re going to have to deal with that. The younger generation are the ones who are going to be working into the future, and we\u2019ve got to figure out how we are going to bring them forward.\u201d\n\nCritics of the hospital\u2019s dismissal of Clary attribute a large part of Marias Medical Center\u2019s burgeoning financial problems to the doctor\u2019s departure, and the large volume of patients who followed him to his newly established clinic and admissions at Northern Rockies Medical Center in Cut Bank.\n\nSeveral Toole County officials, including Ober, Aschim and Iverson, attribute 40 percent to more than half of Marias Medical Center\u2019s past patient admissions to Clary, and question how the hospital can recover from such a dramatic decline in paying customers.\n\n\u201cWhen 40 to 50 percent of your admissions are coming from one doctor, I don\u2019t see how you can cut that out of your system and still make the money,\u201d Aschim said. \u201cIt will take a long time I think \u2014 if it\u2019s going to happen at all.\u201d\n\nBut Hartley said the percentage of billable procedures attributed to Clary has been grossly overstated.\n\nAccording to Hartley, a more accurate figure over the past three or four years is that Clary was responsible for 20 to 30 percent of hospital income, and that Marias Medical Center\u2019s financial problems have more to do with national trends in health care, such as the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, changing community demographics, new Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement formulas and the high cost of new electronic health record systems.\n\nThough he did not provide specific financial details, Hartley said the greatest drain on Marias Medical Center\u2019s financial health has been losses incurred by Toole County\u2019s long-term care facility, the Marias Heritage Center.\n\nHartley said at least $600,000 in the hospital\u2019s long-term debt load is attributable to the Marias Heritage Center, and that the figure may be closer to $1 million. Toole County commissioners are now considering contracting with a nursing home specialist corporation to assume the lease or management of the county-owned facility.\n\n\u201cThe nursing home here has lost money for at least the past four or five years,\u201d Hartley said. \u201cIf we can get that out from under the hospital\u2019s umbrella, to the point where someone else is managing it \u2014 we think that\u2019s a big piece in the financial turnaround.\u201d\n\nFrom a broader perspective, Hartley said Marias Medical Center cannot depend upon the fortunes of a single doctor to determine its long-term financial viability.\n\n\u201cThe whole other part of this thing that I\u2019ve told people is \u2014 how old is he?\u201d Hartley said of Clary. \u201cHow much longer is he going to practice? This isn\u2019t only about the fact that there was a battle with Dr. Clary and he left \u2014 but what happens five, 10, 15 years down the road? We were always going to have to get along without him one way or another. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s as simple as, \u2018Dr. Clary comes back and everything\u2019s fine.\u2019\u201d\n\nThat future was thrown into greater uncertainty on Oct. 6 when the Toole County commissioners voted to dissolve the Marias Medical Center board of trustees.\n\nIn a prepared pubic statement issued at the regularly scheduled October meeting, Commissioner Debbie Brandon said the vote to dissolve the board was made in response to \u201cthe emotional toll\u201d many board volunteers had experienced.\n\n\u201cI had hoped that the public pressure on you as board members would lessen over time, but I no longer believe that is the case,\u201d Brandon said, \u201cand thus my decision.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat was just an excuse,\u201d Iverson said. \u201cNone of the board members requested it be done.\u201d\n\nIverson was a primary force in the creation of the hospital board 23 years ago, and served as board chairman during the first six years of its existence.\n\nProblems resurface\n\nAccording to Iverson, the hospital board was established in 1992 in response to a situation nearly identical to the one Marias Medical Center is confronted with again today. The hospital was operating under a heavy debt load, and Toole County commissioners were engaged in a bitter conflict with one of its doctors \u2014 the same Dr. Robert Clary.\n\n\u201cLee Gibbs, Larry Bonderud and I sat down with the commissioners and Dr. Clary, and the board was formed at that time as a solution to the thing,\u201d Iverson said.\n\nThe seven-member board was empowered to set hospital policy and to draft and oversee the hospital\u2019s annual budget. Iverson said it was also intended to encourage greater community involvement, and to establish a layer of separation between hospital operations and the politics of the Toole County commissioners\u2019 office.\n\nThat separation is now gone. The Toole County commissioners have assumed all the past authority once held by the board of trustees, and there is little doubt the dissolution of the board was prompted, in part, by the likelihood that newly installed trustees would vote to reinstate Clary\u2019s access to the hospital.\n\n\u201cI was going to make a motion to restore full and unrestricted privileges to the hospital,\u201d Aschim said of his intended future actions. \u201cI think they fully knew we were going to bring it to a vote so we could see where they stood.\u201d\n\nUnderdal does not dispute that the commission was at odds with trustees over the continued discussion of Clary\u2019s status.\n\n\u201cI told them at least a half a dozen times \u2014 and I was really straightforward about it \u2014 we\u2019re not going to talk about this at the hospital board meetings,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that\u2019s all we talked about. Every meeting we talked about the same things.\u201d\n\nMarias Medical Center is fully owned by Toole County. Both the hospital and the county were named as defendants in a lawsuit filed by Clary, seeking injunctive relief to re-establish his privileges at Marias Medical Center.\n\nIt is Underdal\u2019s position that only Toole County can respond to any legal liabilities incurred by the hospital, and that the county commissioners were obligated to put an end to the possibility the board of trustees would vote to restore Clary\u2019s access to Marias Medical Center.\n\n\u201cWhen you get sued and they name Toole County, the Toole County commissioners are the only ones who can settle or deal with that issue,\u201d Underdal said. \u201cWe can\u2019t hand that off to somebody else. By law there are some things you just can\u2019t delegate, and we, as elected officials for Toole County, are responsible for anybody that sues us.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t really want to dissolve the board, but I think we were forced to,\u201d he added. \u201cWe would have had a lot more trouble now than we would have, had we not done that.\u201d\n\nUnderdal said the yearlong controversy over Clary has been a costly distraction from the efforts to re-establish Marias Medical Center\u2019s financial health. However, he said the commission and hospital administrators are making advances, and he hopes 2015 will offer some degree of resolution to the swirling controversies.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re serious about staying in business, and we think we have a good chance of doing that,\u201d Underdal said. \u201cTomorrow, we\u2019re not going to be in the black and everything is just great, but I think we\u2019re moving forward, and we\u2019re going to get past this.\u201d\n\nHe also questioned the motivations of that vocal segment of Clary supporters.\n\n\u201cFor some people it\u2019s the \u2018Chicken Little\u2019 approach,\u201d Underdal said. \u201cI really hate to say it, but for some people, they\u2019re hoping the sky does fall because they want to be right. We have some good doctors and we have a good plan there. Clary\u2019s supporters were saying, \u2018He\u2019s the only good doctor, the other doctors are terrible. The hospital\u2019s terrible now because he\u2019s not there.\u2019 That\u2019s not the case, and that really makes me upset. It\u2019s a bad deal, and it\u2019s not true.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: http://gftrib.com/16EuEXx", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "One year later", "og": {"site_name": "Great Falls Tribune", "description": "One year later", "title": "Community remains divided over doctor, medical center", "url": "http://www.greatfallstribune.com/story/news/local/2014/12/20/community-remains-divided-doctor-medical-center/20717117/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/greatfallstribune.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "One year later", "title": "Community remains divided over doctor, medical center", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a6b4db7c7b09b42d650838530f7d9fc582af69f2/c=0-0-2039-2039&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/GreatFalls/2014/12/20/B9315571616Z.1_20141220234430_000_GD99F77MN.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@GFTribune", "site": "@GFTribune", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=863095595", "fb": {"app_id": 137930962930704}, "article": {"author": "www.facebook.com/greatfallstribune"}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc45f\"", "article_summary": "Seven weeks later, the county-owned hospital, Marias Medical Center, revoked Clary\u2019s hospital access privileges based upon similar allegations.\nRoughly 400 people packed into a middle school auditorium to confront the Marias Medical Center board of trustees.\nSome of these have now left employment at Marias Medical Center, citing co-worker intimidation as the reason for their departure.\n\u201cWhen you get sued and they name Toole County, the Toole County commissioners are the only ones who can settle or deal with that issue,\u201d Underdal said.\nOver the past year, Toole County and Marias Medical Center have been named as defendants in at least two Clary-related lawsuits."}
