Law enforcement would be required to record some interrogations under a bill influenced by the case of a Kansas man who spent nearly 16 years behind bars for a killing his brother eventually admitted to committing.

The Topeka Capital-Journal reports that the legislation mandates recorded interrogations of suspects arrested for capital murder, first-degree murder and second-degree murder.

Rep. Ramon Gonzalez, a Perry Republican, says the bill he introduced Tuesday is "partly" a response to the wrongful conviction of Floyd Bledsoe. He was sentenced to life in prison but released Dec. 8, 2015, after a DNA test and suicide notes indicated his brother, Tom Bledsoe, killed Zetta Camille Arfmann in 1999.

Alice Craig, Bledsoe's attorney with the Project for Innocence at the University of Kansas, supports recording interrogations.
