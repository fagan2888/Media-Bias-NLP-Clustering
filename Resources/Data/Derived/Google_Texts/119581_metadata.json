Mass killings have also been emerging \u201cfrom the confused, zigzagging battlefields around the country\u201d as the security forces of Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki attempt to make amends for their losses a week ago, according to The Post.\n\nRelated: Iraq Could Become a Three-Headed Monster\n\nSome experts say that despite the dire threat from the well-financed, al Qaeda-inspired ISIS, Maliki\u2019s Shiite-dominated government will be able to defend the capital city for the foreseeable future.\n\nMoreover, President Obama has announced he had ordered as many as 275 members of the U.S. armed forces into Iraq to protect the American Embassy in Baghdad and is considering other military action to help prop up the Iraqi forces.\n\nKenneth M. Pollack, a Middle Eastern military expert at the Brookings Institution, suggests that despite their early successes, the Sunni militants are likely to encounter \u201ca far more determined and numerous foe\u201d than they have seen up until now. \u201cThe most likely outcome is that fighting will be a vicious stalemate at or north of Baghdad, basically along Iraq\u2019s ethno-sectarian divide.\u201d\n\nRelated: Terrorist Tycoons on a Horrific March to Baghdad\n\nAs Steve LeVine writes in Quartz, power sometimes changes hands amid chaos and rebellion \u2013 not in armed conflict, but in a \u201cnegotiated\u201d conquest. \u201cThat is,\u201d LeVine says, \u201cthe folks inside the capital city sense the momentum shifting against them, perceive either gain or survival by changing sides, and hand the place over through defection or assassination.\u201d\n\nPollack of Brookings suggests that Anbar Province, the large region west of Baghdad with a substantial concentration of Sunni militants, might prove a pivotal conquest for ISIS that could lead to an invasion of Baghdad.\n\nIf brutal force doesn\u2019t work, however, the cash-laden ISIS might try outright bribery to buy off or weaken Shia resolve. Money, after all, has been at the heart of the success of many insurgent armies, according to LeVine. It was a major factor, for example, in the Taliban\u2019s original capture of Kabul in 1996: The Taliban simply \u201cbought off key commanders on the other side,\u201d he wrote.\n\nISIS may be the wealthiest terrorist group on the globe right now, with plentiful resources to buy off Shiite military forces and allies and purchase state-of-the art weaponry. ISIS may have as much as $1.3 billion in cash and assets at its disposal, according to a report in The Guardian. That includes $875 million it accumulated in Syria before its advance into Iraq, in part by seizing oil reserves.\n\nRelated: Iraq: We Broke It, But We Can\u2019t Fix It\n\nMore notably, ISIS last week \u201cmay have made off with some $420 million worth of Iraqi dinars when it captured Mosul\u201d last week and raided the major bank there, says LeVine.\n\n\u201cThat may not sound like a lot when you\u2019re buying what amounts to the keys to an entire country, but it could be sufficient \u2013 the Taliban needed only a few million dollars, including $3 million from Osama bin Laden, to bribe the final group of commanders standing between Jalalabad and Kabul,\u201d according to LeVine.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "For now, at least, Baghdad appears safe from the onslaught of the murderous ISIS.
