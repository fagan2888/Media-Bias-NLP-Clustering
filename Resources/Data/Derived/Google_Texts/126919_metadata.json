The first column discussed many of the basics, and the second column answered reader questions. You can find more readers\u2019 questions and answers on In Practice, with the latest series below. If you\u2019re still not sure how the law affects you and your family, please e-mail me your questions: tsbernard@nytimes.com.\n\nHousehold Members Want Different Plans\n\nQ. My husband and I are self-employed and file our taxes jointly. We will qualify for subsidies. Do we have to get identical policies since we file jointly? Or can one of us get, say, a bronze plan and the other get a silver plan? \u2013Annah\n\nA. It\u2019s your choice. \u201cThey can buy one plan that covers them both or they can buy two separate plans,\u201d said Karen Pollitz, a senior fellow at the Kaiser Family Foundation. If you decided to get two separate plans, and you qualify a tax credit, you can also allocate the credit across the two plans. But that starts to get complicated, so it might be best to ask for more specific advice from your state\u2019s exchange.\n\nWhy Premiums Increased\n\nQ. My 33-year-old husband is self-employed. For the past three years, he has purchased an insurance plan on the individual market from Kaiser Permanente. The plan is a high-deductible, health savings account eligible plan. The deductible is $4,000 and the out-of-pocket maximum is $5,500. He pays about $140/month for it.\n\nThis plan will be eliminated at the end of the year, and the closest option from Kaiser is $250 a month. Plus, the deductible and out-of-pocket maximum are higher. All of the bronze-level plans offered in California are approximately the same price so he can\u2019t switch and get a better deal.\n\nThis was shocking to both of us. We absolutely support the president and the goal of insuring everyone in the U.S., but we didn\u2019t expect to be so negatively affected. Fortunately, this 75 percent increase in premium does not present a financial hardship for us, although it does significantly increase his business costs.\n\nSo I guess my questions are: Why did the premium go up so much and yet the benefits have gotten worse? Is Kaiser taking advantage of this opportunity to raise their rates? Are relatively young, healthy people seeing a similar increase in premiums? Is there anything we can do? \u2013Christine Fry, Oakland, Calif.\n\nA. I sent your question to Kaiser Permanente. To summarize, the company said they haven\u2019t had to raise the premiums on your husband\u2019s plan for the past three years. The increase between your husband\u2019s existing coverage and the new plans available next year may seem especially stark because the insurance will now cover an entire population of individuals, not just healthy ones, a spokesman said. In addition, the plans will also include several essential services, which also contributed to the price increase.\n\nHere\u2019s a more specific explanation, as explained by Christian Stenrud, a Kaiser spokesman:", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20131007152656, "BN": "affordable-care-act", "DISPLAYDATE": "October 7, 2013", "article": {"section": "U.S.", "tag": "Uncategorized", "published_time": 1381174016, "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/us/index.jsonp", "modified_time": "2013-10-07T19:26:56-04:00"}, "keywords": "Health Insurance and Managed Care,Insurance,Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010),Kaiser Permanente,Uncategorized", "PT": "Blogs", "author": "Tara Siegel Bernard", "SCG": "affordable-care-act", "sourceApp": "blogs", "CLMST": "Tara Siegel Bernard", "byl": "Tara Siegel Bernard", "twitter": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/news/affordable-care-act/2013/10/07/readers-ask-about-families-who-want-different-plans-and-rise-in-costs/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "description": "More answers to readers\u2019 questions about how the online insurance exchanges will affect them.", "card": "summary", "title": "Readers Ask About Families Who Want Different Plans, and Rise in Costs"}, "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/affordable-care-act/post", "description": "More answers to readers\u2019 questions about how the online insurance exchanges will affect them.", "CG": "U.S.", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "October 7, 2013", "org": "Kaiser Permanente", "utime": 20131007192656, "PUD": 20131007, "pdate": 20131007, "des": "Health Insurance and Managed Care;Insurance;Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010)", "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "og": {"site_name": "In Practice", "description": "More answers to readers\u2019 questions about how the online insurance exchanges will affect them.", "title": "Readers Ask About Families Who Want Different Plans, and Rise in Costs", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/news/affordable-care-act/2013/10/07/readers-ask-about-families-who-want-different-plans-and-rise-in-costs/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs_v3/../../packages/images/nytdesign/2013/national/inPractice/inPractice-75.png", "type": "article"}, "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "Readers Ask About Families Who Want Different Plans, and Rise in Costs", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "PST": "Blog Post"}, "article_summary": "For the past three years, he has purchased an insurance plan on the individual market from Kaiser Permanente.\nHere\u2019s a more specific explanation, as explained by Christian Stenrud, a Kaiser spokesman:\nIf you decided to get two separate plans, and you qualify a tax credit, you can also allocate the credit across the two plans.\nIn the last two installments of the Your Money column, I answered questions about the new health insurance exchanges.\nIn addition, the plans will also include several essential services, which also contributed to the price increase."}
