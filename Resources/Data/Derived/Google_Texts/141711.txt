On the latest Sports Retort podcast, Jason Gay and Jim Chairusmi join the show from Sochi to ponder which Winter Olympic sport they would feel least embarrassed competing in with no training. Besides curling, obviously. Jim offers his thoughts after his first experience viewing cross-country skiing (in 60-degree weather) and Geoff divulges his surprising number of beefs with the sport.

Jason, recovered from finding a stranger sleeping in his hotel room, explains how Sochi reminds him of an early morning at Disney World’s Epcot Center and defends U.S. sports fans who resent Olympic spoilers. Plus, we wonder about the MLB front offices biting their nails about whether retiring Yankees great Derek Jeter requires the same level of sendoff his teammate Mariano Rivera got last season.
