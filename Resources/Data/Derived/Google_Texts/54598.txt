A nursing home employee was arrested and charged with stealing a resident’s credit card.

Police arrested Dorothy Duckworth, 54, of Colerain Township, Wednesday and charged her with theft and misuse of a credit card.

Investigators said Duckworth works at the Marjorie P. Lee Retirement Community in Hyde Park and entered the 96-year-old victim’s private room while she slept and stole her credit card.

Duckworth then used the credit card to make $185 worth of purchases at the Red Bank Road Walmart, officers said.

Store surveillance video caught Duckworth making the purchases.

Duckworth was booked into the Hamilton County Jail. She will be arraigned Friday morning on the felony charges.
