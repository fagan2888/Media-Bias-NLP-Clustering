They start losing their consumer; their differentiation fades, and they become replaceable. At some point, everyone will lose their advantage,\u201d said Elevation Forum founder and strategist Dan Mack, throwing down the gauntlet at a Friday morning meeting of Mack\u2019s Elevation Forum, which brings together a group of leading sales and marketing executives from a number of fast-growing health and beauty companies in the CPG industry.\n\nAt the April 15th meeting, keynote speaker Jason Reiser, EVP and chief merchandising officer at Family Dollar, led a discussion on the value economy, examining how companies can create innovation and loyalty with the new value consumer. \u201cThere\u2019s a new normal in the value channel and within the value economy,\u201d Reiser told Elevation Forum attendees. \u201cAnd if your marketers don\u2019t understand my consumers\u2019 financial pain, you don\u2019t understand my business, or this consumer.\u201d\n\nAccording to Bain Consulting, the average U.S. company loses 50% of its customers every five years, a defection rate of 10% to 30% per year. At some point every company loses its advantage. Such events as the Elevation Forum \u201ckeep organizations and leaders in tune with their blind spots and discovering new trends effecting the industry,\u201d Mack told Drug Store News.\n\nExecutives from 40-plus Forum member companies engaged in a wide-open dialogue on The Pareto Principle \u2014 also known as the Law of the Vital Few, but perhaps more commonly known as the the \u201c80\u201320 principle.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is an unbalance between effort and reward, and threats versus risks,\u201d Mack told attendees. \u201cWe all know that 20% of your customers deliver 80% of the revenue, but we fail to recognize that 20% of competitive threats create 80% of the risk. These risks often arrive as new, disruptive business models, emerging technologies and consumer behavioral shifts.\u201d\n\nThe group examined the challenges that companies experience \u201cbecause we don\u2019t know what we don\u2019t know, or we fail to understand new trends that will disrupt our business,\u201d Mack said. \u201cEveryone needs a trusted advisor to help them uncover personal blind spots and biases.\u201d\n\nRecognizing that elite sales organizations are purpose-driven, Elevation Forum members explored the traits, behaviors and philosophies that characterize elite sales organizations. Key themes revolved around sharing uncommon insights, addressing the retailer\u2019s high-agenda priorities and cultivating a stubborn resolve to see the best ideas through to the end. \u201cThe elite [sales organizations] never let a great idea die,\u201d Mack explained. \u201cThey are courageous and they think winning is when the retailer and brand win with the customer. [They] learn to deliver bad news about their own items before the buyer does. [They display] insatiable curiosity, [they are] present and [they are good listeners]. The elite also understand the broader context of the industry, emerging new trends and what\u2019s next.\u201d\n\nThe next Elevation Forum event will be held next month in an intimate meeting in New Jersey, featuring Wakefern Food VP health and beauty care Chris Skyers. The theme for the discussion will be \u201cDisruption, agility and corporate flexibility: How to drive advantage for your organization.\u201d For more information, visit MackElevationForum.com/.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.drugstorenews.com/sites/drugstorenews.com/files/field_thumbnail_image/04-2016/mack-elevation-main-image.jpg", "description": "At Saturdays Mack Elevation Forum, keynote speaker Jason Reiser, Family Dollars EVP and chief merchandising officer, discussed the value economy, examining how companies can create innovation and loyalty with the new value consumer.", "og": {"image": {"width": 200, "identifier": "http://www.drugstorenews.com/sites/drugstorenews.com/files/field_medium_image/04-2016/mack-elevation-main-image.jpg", "height": 200}, "type": "article", "title": "Family Dollar\u2019s Reiser explores the \u2018new normal\u2019"}, "twitter": {"description": "WEST PALM BEACH, FLA. \u2014 \u201cTwenty percent of public companies experience growth stalls, losing 50% of their capitalization due to poor strategic decisions.
