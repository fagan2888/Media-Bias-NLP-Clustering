But a new analysis by this newspaper shows city leaders ultimately gave up all those additional cuts -- worth some $49 million a year -- and more in the settlement with police and firefighters they announced with great fanfare earlier this month. Details released since the initial announcement show significant givebacks to retirees and new hires that were not initially revealed. Still, it may have been the best city leaders could do. Faced with an increasingly unfavorable legal outlook and an exodus of cops and other workers, city leaders acknowledge they struggled to reach an accord that preserves the roughly $25 million in annual retirement savings they gained when voters overwhelmingly passed the Measure B pension reforms three years ago. \"We didn't get everything I wanted or that the council wanted,\" Liccardo said. \"But we met our key objectives.\" But whether the city could have achieved that same, lower level of savings without three years of backbiting and bad blood with its own employees may be argued over for years to come. Advertisement Approved by nearly 70 percent of city voters over union objections in June 2012, Measure B reduced pensions for new hires, eliminated extra \"bonus\" checks to retirees from the city's underfunded pension plans, made it harder to qualify for disability retirement and called for veteran workers to either pay a lot more for their pensions or choose a reduced benefit. City unions immediately sued to overturn the measure. A judge in 2013 blocked the higher pension contributions from city workers -- the most controversial and valuable of the measure's provisions -- citing state legal precedents effectively forbidding changes to government employees' retirement benefits after they're hired. While both sides threatened appeals, the city saw cops, wastewater technicians, planners and other workers bolt for better compensation elsewhere, leaving several departments in a staffing crisis and amplifying critics' calls to end the legal battle. The city hopes it did so with the settlement announced July 15. The firefighters ratified the proposed settlement, but it still needs ratification from the police union and City Council approval. The city next month will push for similar agreements with the city's other unions. Among the proposed settlement's changes: Current employees: The settlement abandons nearly $50 million in court-blocked annual savings from having workers hired before Measure B pay more for their pensions or choose a smaller benefit. New hires: The settlement increases the pension benefit for newly hired city workers to align with those in the state retirement system under changes the Legislature adopted after Measure B. New cops and firefighters will have a lower retirement age and higher maximum pension of 80 percent of pay than Measure B allowed. But city officials note the state system has no maximum pension cap, and say the settlement keeps key Measure B provisions: forbidding retroactive pension increases that create massive debt in the retirement system, and an agreement to split the full cost of the benefit with the city. Liccardo said it keeps about 80 percent of Measure B's new-hire pension savings. Retiree bonus checks: The settlement maintains elimination of these but substitutes a more limited benefit for veteran workers and retirees that would guarantee their pensions keep 75 percent of their \"purchasing power.\" City officials say only about 55 older police and fire retirees would qualify, and that its added costs are about 5 percent of the original bonus check tab. A court ruling this year blocking San Francisco's elimination of bonus checks left San Jose officials uneasy about their chances of eliminating them entirely. Retiree health care: One of the city's biggest retirement bill savings came not from Measure B but an administrative change in the medical plan offerings that reduced health benefits for retirees. Under the proposed settlement, new hires would no longer be promised full premium coverage in retirement for the cheapest health plan offered city workers. Instead, they would pay into a retirement health savings plan with no city contribution. Veteran employees and retirees would have the option of switching to that savings plan. Otherwise, the city would tie the value of their retirement health benefit to the \"silver\" plan under President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act. City officials said eliminating the defined retirement health benefit will yield substantial savings not only for the city but employees, who saw big paycheck deductions for costs of the deeply underfunded plan. Disability: The proposed settlement reverses Measure B provisions that required injured workers to take other city jobs if they could, but retains having an independent medical expert panel make disability determinations. Legal fees: The proposed settlement calls for the city to pay $1.5 million in legal fees and to have an arbitrator resolve remaining union claims for legal fees. Liccardo said it was the most distasteful part of the deal and the one that nearly hung up a settlement, but he called it \"a bargain in the big picture\" that would be dwarfed by annual savings in the deal. Overall, Liccardo said, \"The savings we obtained in Measure B were very much in peril, so we got them in other places,\" adding the deal would allow the city to \"hang on to nearly every dollar\" of savings it has gained since the measure's passage. Former Mayor Chuck Reed, Measure B's leading champion, called the settlement reasonable under the circumstances. \"These changes protect much of the savings of Measure B,\" Reed said, calling the battle with city unions the measure unleashed \"painful, but necessary\" to ease the bite of retirement costs that more than tripled in a decade and now consume a quarter of the city's operating funds. The city's retirement costs continue to grow, from $305 million now to an estimated $320 million in five years. Reed said it was either take on the fiscal issues -- which included Measure B -- or lay off 500 employees and potentially file bankruptcy. Still, critics argued that what's left after the proposed settlement could have been achieved through negotiations years ago, without need for the Measure B battle. \"You look at the deal they now have on the table -- that probably would've been a reasonable conclusion had the two sides come to the table,\" said Pat Waite, a longtime resident and retired finance executive. Councilman Ash Kalra credited Liccardo with settling the contentious issue, but said the mayor also helped create the problem. \"It's ironic that he's being hailed for his leadership for doing something that should have been done years ago,\" Kalra said. The settlement framework only covers cops and firefighters, but set the stage for talks with the city's other employee unions, which begin next month. John Mukhar, president of the city's Association of Engineers and Architects, predicted other unions will support similar settlements, calling the retiree health changes \"a huge advantage to both the city and the employees.\" A big question is how to implement the settlement of voter-approved charter changes. The soonest the city could take the measure to voters is November 2016. Both sides want it enacted now, but some experts say making changes without voter input could expose San Jose to lawsuits. \"After all, voters are paying for it,\" said Mark Hinkle, president of the Silicon Valley Taxpayers Association. \"I trust the taxpayers more than I trust the special interests and City Hall.\" Follow Ramona Giwargis at Twitter.com/ramonagiwargis or contact her at 408-920-5705.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.mercurynews.com/bay-area-news/ci_28538051/settlement-details-show-struggle-keep-san-jose-pension", "sailthru.author": "By Ramona Giwargis    rgiwargis@mercurynews.com", "ag": {"canon": "TheMercuryNews:article:28538051:view"}, "startDate": "2015-07-25T14:24:43-0600", "twitter": {"domain": "mercurynews.com", "description": "Details of the proposed settlement of San Jose's pension measure lawsuits show givebacks to workers as city struggled to hang on to savings.", "title": "Settlement details show struggle to keep San Jose pension cuts", "url": "http://www.mercurynews.com/bay-area-news/ci_28538051/settlement-details-show-struggle-keep-san-jose-pension", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site568/2015/0725/20150725__SJM-PENSION-0726~1.JPG", "site": "@mercnews", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "San Jose Mercury News for iPad", "iphone": "San Jose Mercury News for iPhone", "googleplay": "San Jose Mercury News"}, "id": {"ipad": "id551437906", "iphone": "id479955259", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.californianewspaperpartnership.sanjosemercurynews"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Bay Area News", "modificationDate": "2015-07-25T15:27:45-0600", "endDate": "2025-07-25T14:24:40-0600", "news_keywords": "Bay Area, silicon valley, san jose, mercury news, Bay Area headlines", "byline": "By Ramona Giwargisrgiwargis@mercurynews.com", "pubDate": "2015-07-25T14:26:14-0600", "sailthru.date": "2015-07-25T13:24:43-0700", "sailthru.title": "Settlement details show struggle to keep San Jose pension cuts", "verify-v1": "cgRcFjhKBsmYEfbwi2qePjkOzvy8XWnvfTpK75N3BmQ=", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site568/2015/0725/20150725__SJM-PENSION-0726~1_300.JPG", "description": "Details of the proposed settlement of San Jose's pension measure lawsuits show givebacks to workers as city struggled to hang on to savings.", "sailthru.site": "mercurynews.com", "fb": {"admins": "702185068,661331474,100001900804139", "page_id": 63095136336, "app_id": 328320203930030}, "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "og": {"url": "http://www.mercurynews.com/bay-area-news/ci_28538051/settlement-details-show-struggle-keep-san-jose-pension", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site568/2015/0725/20150725__SJM-PENSION-0726~1.JPG", "type": "article", "description": "Details of the proposed settlement of San Jose's pension measure lawsuits show givebacks to workers as city struggled to hang on to savings.", "title": "Settlement details show struggle to keep San Jose pension cuts"}, "google-site-verification": "jvnaFa4kq5tUDhFMQZ84bDI74A2qnu0gfhxZjZXlkko", "y_key": "8cb7e37d57339cb3", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site568/2015/0725/20150725__SJM-PENSION-0726~1.JPG"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc192\"", "article_summary": "Print Email Font Resize Font Resize Settlement details show struggle to keep San Jose pension cutsSan Jose police officers at City Hall for a National Police Week event in 2009.\n(KAREN T.
