Denver released Montee Ball on Sunday, leaving the fourth slot behind C.J. Anderson, Ronnie Hillman and Juwan Thompson to Bibbs, who has strong chance of being called up to the active roster.\n\nWATCH: Denver Broncos Week 1 report by beat writer Troy E. Renck\n\n\u201cIt had a lot to do with being able to get Kapri back on the football team. It had nothing to do with Montee,\u201d Kubiak said Monday. \u201cYou better have four backs in this league.\u201d\n\nBibbs spent four weeks of his rookie season last year on the 53-man roster after signing with the team as a college free agent, but didn\u2019t play a game.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m blessed,\u201d Bibbs said. \u201cWhen I get my opportunity, I\u2019m going to be ready for it. I want to show everyone I\u2019m better than they think I am.\u201d\n\nKyle Roberts, a 6-foot-6, 305-pound tackle out of Nevada, started at right tackle for the Broncos in their preseason finale Saturday against the Cardinals. Roberts, one of the Broncos\u2019 undrafted free agents, played every snap against Arizona.\n\nUko, a 4-3 tackle in the Buccaneers\u2019 defense last season, played one game for Tampa Bay after spending two stints on its practice squad. At 6-foot-3, 284 pounds, Uko played both defensive end and tackle at Southern California. In his three seasons (2011-13) at USC, he recorded 83 tackles (34 solo) and 11.5 sacks.\n\nLynch, a 6-foot-5, 258-pound tight end out of Georgia was a 2013 first-team All-Southeastern Conference selection and fifth-round pick by the Dolphins that year. He was placed on the injured reserve his rookie season with a back injury and was subsequently waived by Miami before the Jets claimed him.\n\nNew York waived Lynch on Saturday.\n\nNot on the Broncos\u2019 10-player practice squad? Ben Garland, an offensive linemen out of Air Force Academy whom the team had hoped to retain on the practice squad after it waived him Saturday. Garland entered training camp as the Broncos\u2019 starting left guard, but lost out to rookie Max Garcia and eventually slid off the depth chart.\n\nPractice notes\n\n\u2022 The Broncos\u2019 slimmed-down roster allowed for three noticeable absences: defensive ends Kenny Anunike (knee) and Derek Wolfe (suspension) and safety T.J. Ward (suspension). Wolfe and Ward will both be absent from the team and all activities until they are reinstated by the league from their suspensions.\n\nKubiak said that Anunike is making considerable progress from his knee injury and has been working with the trainers. During camp, Kubiak had expressed hope that Anunike would be available for the opener against Baltimore.\n\n\u201cThe second I get the go-ahead, I\u2019m out there. This is not me on the sideline. I\u2019m ready to make some plays,\u201d Anunike said.\n\nMore than anything Anunike said he\u2019s ready to hit a quarterback again.\n\n\u201cOne thing about Kenny is he works extremely hard and has a tendency to come back very quickly from things,\u201d Kubiak said Monday. \u201cI\u2019m expecting him back pretty quickly.\u201d\n\n\u2022 The Broncos\u2019 new backup center, James Ferentz, is a quick, undersized lineman who Kubiak said reminds him of starter Matt Paradis.\n\n\u2022 Peyton Manning was in regular-season mode Monday as he wore a glove on his right throwing hand.\n\n\u2022 Outside linebacker Lerentee McCray practiced Monday, but he is still considered day-to-day.\n\n\u2022 Safety David Bruton (in place of Ward) and defensive end Antonio Smith (in place of Wolfe) will both start Sunday for their suspended teammates, but Kubiak said he would expect a rotation for both positions.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to see us defensively and offensively have a lot of guys on the field,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s very important early in the NFL season. Not many people have been past 30 plays in this league.\u201d\n\nJersey number changes\n\nThe Broncos, in addition to announcing the final pieces of their practice squad, announced jersey number changes for some players:\n\nQuarterback Trevor Siemian will shed No. 3 for No. 13 and inside linebacker Zaire Anderson will ditch No. 47 for No. 50. And cornerback Curtis Marsh gave up No. 38 for 32.\n\nFor the newcomers, center James Ferentz will wear No. 53, tight end Mitchell Henry will take No. 84, tight end Arthur Lynch will don No. 83 and George Uko will get No. 99.\n\nTracing their steps\n\nSeveral former Broncos found a home on practice squads across the league Sunday: receiver Nathan Palmer (Patriots), tight end Marcel Jensen (Falcons), linebacker Lamin Barrow (Bears) and quarterback Zac Dysert (Texans).\n\nBroncos\u2019 2015 practice squad:\n\nZaire Anderson, ILB\n\nKapri Bibbs, RB\n\nDillon Day, C\n\nChuka Ndulue, DE\n\nArthur Lynch, TE\n\nDanny Mason, OLB\n\nTaurean Nixon, CB\n\nKyle Roberts, T\n\nJordan Taylor, WR\n\nGeorge Uko, DE", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Broncos finalize 10-man practice squad, sign RB Kapri Bibbs", "title": "Broncos finalize 10-man practice squad, sign RB Kapri Bibbs", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/09/07/broncos-finalize-10-man-practice-squad-sign-rb-kapri-bibbs/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150907__SP03FBNBRONCOS_JA29965ap1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150907__SP03FBNBRONCOS_JA29965ap1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-07T08:46:40+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-21T17:29:59+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddd1a\"", "article_summary": "The Broncos\u2019 practice squad is complete.\nNot on the Broncos\u2019 10-player practice squad?\nLynch, a 6-foot-5, 258-pound tight end out of Georgia was a 2013 first-team All-Southeastern Conference selection and fifth-round pick by the Dolphins that year.\nUko, a 4-3 tackle in the Buccaneers\u2019 defense last season, played one game for Tampa Bay after spending two stints on its practice squad.\nBen Garland, an offensive linemen out of Air Force Academy whom the team had hoped to retain on the practice squad after it waived him Saturday."}
