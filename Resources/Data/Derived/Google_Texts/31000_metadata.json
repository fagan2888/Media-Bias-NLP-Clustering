Students were required to audition to participate in the band, and seven different local high schools were represented.\n\nAdmission to the event was free, and fans were encouraged to bring their own chairs and blankets, but several food vendors were on scene, and artists' CDs also were for sale. By mid-afternoon, the crowd was estimated at at least 200 strong.\n\nSix bands were advertised on the program, concluding with the Fat City Mardi Gras Band, slated to take the stage last at 5:45 p.m. Additionally, Paul Romaine and the Longmont Jazz All Stars offered a clinic earlier in the program.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.timescall.com/longmont-local-news/ci_26180184/jazz-fest-fills-summers-day-smorgasbord-sound", "sailthru.section": "Local News", "sailthru.author": "by Times-Call staff", "description": "The Roosevelt Park Pavilion was ground zero for an explosion of sound Saturday as the 16th Annual Jazz Festival offered music from across the contemporary landscape throughout the warm summer day.", "ag": {"canon": "LongmontTimes-Call:article:26180184:view"}, "startDate": "2014-07-19T15:57:19-0600", "og": {"url": "http://www.timescall.com/longmont-local-news/ci_26180184/jazz-fest-fills-summers-day-smorgasbord-sound", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2014/0719/20140719__20tcajazw.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The Roosevelt Park Pavilion was ground zero for an explosion of sound Saturday as the 16th Annual Jazz Festival offered music from across the contemporary landscape throughout the warm summer day.", "title": "Jazz fest fills a summer's day with smorgasbord of sound"}, "twitter": {"domain": "timescall.com", "description": "The Roosevelt Park Pavilion was ground zero for an explosion of sound Saturday as the 16th Annual Jazz Festival offered music from across the contemporary landscape throughout the warm summer day.", "title": "Jazz fest fills a summer's day with smorgasbord of sound", "url": "http://www.timescall.com/longmont-local-news/ci_26180184/jazz-fest-fills-summers-day-smorgasbord-sound", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2014/0719/20140719__20tcajazw.jpg", "site": "@TimesCall", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-07-19T15:57:19-0600", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "sailthru.title": "Jazz fest fills a summer's day with smorgasbord of sound", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "byline": "by Times-Call staff", "google-site-verification": "lLtD9ZooxmJUEEdRSCVzkO06t_hYKtyDqZF7EA3N2U0", "modificationDate": "2014-07-19T16:04:10-0600", "endDate": "2024-07-19T15:57:19-0600", "sailthru.site": "timescall.com", "pubDate": "2014-07-19T16:04:35-0600", "news_keywords": "Longmont Colorado TimesCall local news"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb959\"", "article_summary": "The event kicked off with the Longmont All Star Jazz Band, featuring the top jazz students from the Longmont area.\nThe Roosevelt Park Pavilion was ground zero for an explosion of sound Saturday as the 16th Annual Jazz Festival offered music from across the contemporary landscape throughout the warm summer day.\nStudents were required to audition to participate in the band, and seven different local high schools were represented.\nSix bands were advertised on the program, concluding with the Fat City Mardi Gras Band, slated to take the stage last at 5:45 p.m. Additionally, Paul Romaine and the Longmont Jazz All Stars offered a clinic earlier in the program.\nBy mid-afternoon, the crowd was estimated at at least 200 strong."}
