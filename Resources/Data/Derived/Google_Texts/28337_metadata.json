Zuckerberg was in Beijing to attend an economic forum.\n\nChina has called for the creation of a global Internet \u201cgovernance system\u201d and cooperation between countries to regulate Internet use, stepping up efforts to promote controls that activists complain stifle free expression.\n\nFacebook and other Western social media, including Twitter, are banned in China. Zuckerberg has long been courting China\u2019s leaders in a so far futile attempt to access the country with the world\u2019s largest number of Internet users - 668 million as of last year.\n\nChina has been increasing control over its Internet, dubbed the Great Firewall because it is already heavily censored. Liu, a member of the Politburo Standing Committee, the ruling Communist Party\u2019s top leadership panel, recently said that all Internet users must not cross the \u201cbaseline\u201d when discussing China\u2019s governance.\n\nChinese censors have introduced a slate of new regulations to better enable them to police digital and social media as closely as traditional publications. The country\u2019s top Internet regulator has repeatedly warned that an untamed cyberspace would pose a risk to domestic security, and that the government should decide who to allow into \u201cits house.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg held a rare meeting with China's propaganda chief, at a time when Chinese authorities are tightening control over their cyberspace.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg held a rare meeting with China\u2019s propaganda chief, at a time when Chinese authorities are tightening control over their cyberspace.", "title": "Facebook\u2019s Zuckerberg meets with China\u2019s propaganda chief", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/20/facebooks-zuckerberg-meets-chinas-propaganda-chief/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/03/19/china_development_forum.jpeg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/03/19/china_development_forum.jpeg", "description": "Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg held a rare meeting with China's propaganda chief, at a time when Chinese authorities are tightening control over their cyberspace.", "card": "summary", "title": "Facebook\u2019s Zuckerberg meets with China\u2019s propaganda chief"}, "Author": "LOUISE WATT", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "BEIJING (AP) - Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg held a rare meeting with China\u2019s propaganda chief, at a time when Chinese authorities are tightening control over their cyberspace.\nChinese censors have introduced a slate of new regulations to better enable them to police digital and social media as closely as traditional publications.\nZuckerberg has long been courting China\u2019s leaders in a so far futile attempt to access the country with the world\u2019s largest number of Internet users - 668 million as of last year.\nFacebook and other Western social media, including Twitter, are banned in China.\nLiu, a member of the Politburo Standing Committee, the ruling Communist Party\u2019s top leadership panel, recently said that all Internet users must not cross the \u201cbaseline\u201d when discussing China\u2019s governance."}
