More than 2.7 million people have enrolled in the exchange, including 1.9 million in Medicaid and 827,000 in private coverage, the state Health Department said.\n\n\u201cToday more than 2.7 million New Yorkers now have access to quality, affordable health care, a testament to our progress in helping those without insurance find coverage that works for them,\u201d said Donna Frescatore, the program's executive director, in a statement.\n\nDespite its success in enrolling uninsured New Yorkers, there are concerns about the solvency of the program, Standard and Poor's, the credit agency, said in a report Tuesday. The agency said 12 insurers in the exchange sustained losses of about $160 million for 2014.\n\nAdditionally, one of the state's largest insurers, Health Republic, was shut down last fall because of mounting losses, and insurers and providers are seeking a state fund of at least $200 million to help offset costs associated with Health Republic's demise.\n\n\"If insurers continue to lose money, it's only a matter of time before many drain their capital cushions and are forced to either significantly raise prices or drop out of the New York exchange,\" the S&P report said.\n\nS&P said that while larger insurance companies can sustain the losses \"for some time,\" small insurers may be imperiled \u2014 which could lead consumers to have fewer plans to choose from in the exchange, as well as higher costs.\n\nThe problem with the program is one that states across the nation are facing, but in New York, one of 13 states with a state-run exchange, the situation may be more acute, the report suggested.\n\nProviders and insurers pointed to the report as another sign of looming problems with the fiscal health of the state's exchange.\n\n\u201cPlans cannot be expected to continue losing money year after year and remain viable,\" said Paul Macielak, president of the state Health Plan Association, which represents insurers, in a statement.\n\nThe state Health Department and the Department of Financial Services have hailed the exchange, saying it has successfully enrolled New Yorkers in health insurance \u2014 even if the majority have been on the government-funded Medicaid program for the poor and disabled. The Department of Financial Services has limited increases in insurance rates in recent years, which has been praised by consumers but derided by insurers.\n\nThe S&P report said the uninsured rate in New York declined to about 7 percent last year, down from 11 percent in 2013.\n\n\"We\u2019re reminding New Yorkers there\u2019s still time to get affordable health insurance through the marketplace,\" Frescatore said.\n\nPeople who do not enroll in a health plan by Sunday will be unable to access a plan for the rest of the year \u2014 unless they have a qualifying \u201clife event,\u201d such as marriage, losing employer coverage or, under a new law this year, become pregnant.\n\nBut enrollment in Medicaid, Child Health Plus and the Essential Plan, which is new this year for lower income New Yorkers, is open all year.\n\nTo enroll in a health plan, visit nystateofhealth.ny.gov/ or call (855) 355-5777.\n\nThe call center is open Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m., and from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. on Saturday and Sunday.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://press.sn/1SOhpIP", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "A new report questioned the long-term viability of New York's health exchange as the deadline to enroll is Sunday.", "og": {"site_name": "Pressconnects", "description": "A new report questioned the long-term viability of New York's health exchange as the deadline to enroll is Sunday.", "title": "NY health exchange questions remain; deadline Sunday", "url": "http://www.pressconnects.com/story/news/local/new-york/2016/01/29/ny-exchange-questions-remain-deadline-approaches/79519390/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/pressconnects.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A new report questioned the long-term viability of New York's health exchange as the deadline to enroll is Sunday.", "creator": "@pressconnects", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/60f6a11c8d13e491aa22d40588f2e1ba99f37463/c=44-0-210-166&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/01/29/Westchester/Westchester/635896668213901863-Health-exchange-logos.png", "title": "NY health exchange questions remain; deadline Sunday", "site": "@pressconnects", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=887930428", "fb": {"app_id": 176086195755788}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "article_summary": "The emblem for New York's health exchange (Photo: Albany Bureau)ALBANY \u2014 A new report questioned the long-term viability of New York's health exchange as the deadline to enroll is Sunday.\nNew Yorkers have through Sunday to enroll in the \"NY State of Health,\" the state's health exchange established through the federal Affordable Care Act.\nMore than 2.7 million people have enrolled in the exchange, including 1.9 million in Medicaid and 827,000 in private coverage, the state Health Department said.\nTo enroll in a health plan, visit nystateofhealth.ny.gov/ or call (855) 355-5777.\nProviders and insurers pointed to the report as another sign of looming problems with the fiscal health of the state's exchange."}
