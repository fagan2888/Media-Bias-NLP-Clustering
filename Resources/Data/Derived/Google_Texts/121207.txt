On June 19, The Morning Star Institute, a national Native rights organization, will hold a respectful observance to honor sacred places, sacred beings, and all who care for them, and protect them from harm.

The National Sacred Places Prayer Day gathering will be held on the U.S. Capitol Grounds in the west front grassy area at 8:30 a.m., and be in the form of a talking circle. The public is welcome to attend, and all are welcome to share words, songs, or a moment of silence for all sacred places, especially those being desecrated now.
