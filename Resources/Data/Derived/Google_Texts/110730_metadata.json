But at a fundraiser in California on Monday, Obama warned them they shouldn\u2019t expect him to do an end run around them to force change on major issues instead.\n\n\u201cSomebody keeps on yelling, \u2018Executive order,\u2019\u201d Obama said. \u201cWell, I\u2019m going to actually pause on this issue because a lot of people have been saying this lately on every problem, which is just sign an executive order, and we can pretty much do anything and basically nullify Congress.\u201d\n\nIt was the second time in less than 24 hours the president had addressed the issue. Earlier Monday, an immigration activist interrupted a speech by Obama in San Francisco, calling out \u201cYou have a power to stop deportation for all undocumented immigrants in this country!\u201d\n\n\u201cActually, I don\u2019t,\u201d Obama replied.\n\nAt his fundraiser later that night, Obama pressed the argument, telling donors that his administration could only do so much on its own and that \u201cthere is no shortcut to democracy.\u201d Sure, Congress may be a barren unforgiving wasteland where legislation goes to die a long and painful death, but it\u2019s the only game in town.\n\n\u201cAs laborious as it seems sometimes, as much misinformation as there is out there sometimes, as frustrating as it may be sometimes, what we have to do is just keep on going, keep on pushing, he said. \u201cAnd eventually, we move in a better direction.\u201d\n\nObama offered a specific example, the military\u2019s Don\u2019t Ask Don\u2019t Tell policy, which his supporters called on him to end through executive order alone. Instead, he spent two years building support for the change before passing it through Congress with bipartisan backing. Lately, LGBT rights activists have urged Obama to ban discrimination against gay and transgender federal employees, an issue the White House has preferred to address through Congress.\n\nThere have been a number of key points where the White House and progressives have disagreed over the limits of Obama\u2019s powers. One notable case is the debt limit, where many observers have argued the Constitution empowers the Treasury Department to either ignore Congress or get around its requirements by minting trillion dollar coins to fill its coffers. The White House ruled out both paths as legally unsound.\n\nRegardless of Obama\u2019s claims that his hands are tied, there\u2019s a good reason activists push so hard for administrative solutions to their problems: they sometimes win.\n\nWhen he first took office, the president used to tell immigration activists it was beyond his power to halt deportations for young undocumented immigrants. But as protests mounted, he changed his mind and did just that in 2012. Obama also told gay rights activists that his administration was required to protect the Defense of Marriage Act in court, despite his personal desire to repeal the law. He ended up reversing his position on that too and eventually a Supreme Court decision overturned parts of the law.\n\nIronically, while Obama is beset by progressive demands that he take a more aggressive tack through administrative action, it\u2019s a given on the right that the president has engaged in unprecedented abuse of power through executive orders. The most prominent recent example is the administration\u2019s tweaks to various Affordable Care Act deadlines, which Republicans argue only Congress can approve.\n\nBut Obama has issued fewer executive orders than most modern presidents and mainstream legal experts don\u2019t see much that\u2019s particularly unusual about their scope.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always hard to quantify, but he seems to me well within the mainstream of recent presidents in his use of executive orders and other instruments for directing policy,\u201d Eric Posner, a professor of law at University of Chicago, told msnbc.\n\nNo one\u2019s making the case that Obama\u2019s various administrative fixes, especially on immigration, are a better solution than changing the law. For one thing, they\u2019re vulnerable to being reversed by whoever takes office next. For another, they can poison relations with Congress and make legislation harder to enact, though these days those complaints seem almost quaint.\n\nBut they do move the ball forward in the short term. And given that the Republican Congress is unlikely to approve policy changes of any significance over the next three years, you can expect liberal calls for action to swell over time.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "Democrats sick of House Republicans blocking their agenda want the president to use executive orders, but he warned supporters that \"there is no shortcut.\"", "original-source": "http://www.msnbc.com/hardball/what-obama-cant-do", "og": {"site_name": "MSNBC", "description": "Democrats sick of House Republicans blocking their agenda want the president to use executive orders, but he warned supporters that \"there is no shortcut.\"", "title": "Obama to progressives: My power is limited", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/hardball/what-obama-cant-do", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/obama.jpeg-0cd01.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "msnbc.com", "account_id": 2836421, "creator": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/hardball/what-obama-cant-do", "image": {"width": 830, "identifier": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--3-2--512x342/public/obama.jpeg-0cd01.jpg?itok=hN3fhqLG", "height": 553}, "title": "Obama to progressives: My power is limited", "site": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Democrats sick of House Republicans blocking their agenda want the president to use executive orders, but he warned supporters that \"there is no shortcut.\""}, "robots": "follow, index", "DC.date.issued": "2013-11-26T17:30:00-05:00", "jenga-session-config": "{\"when_to_init\":\"after_dom_ready\"}", "fb": {"app_id": 351594351545594}, "nv": {"author": "fb-benjysarlin", "title": "Obama to progressives: My power is limited", "tags": "democrats,equality,immigration,hardball", "published": 1, "date": "11/26/2013 17:30:00 EST", "address": "http://www.msnbc.com/hardball/what-obama-cant-do"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/msnbc", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/msnbc"}, "abstract": "Democrats sick of House Republicans blocking their agenda want the president to use executive orders, but he warned supporters that \"there is no shortcut.\"", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Democrats, Equality, Immigration"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9d7d\"", "article_summary": "Earlier Monday, an immigration activist interrupted a speech by Obama in San Francisco, calling out \u201cYou have a power to stop deportation for all undocumented immigrants in this country!\u201d\u201cActually, I don\u2019t,\u201d Obama replied.\nThere have been a number of key points where the White House and progressives have disagreed over the limits of Obama\u2019s powers.\nPresident Obama\u2019s supporters aren\u2019t thrilled that House Republicans keep blocking any and every legislative item on his agenda.\nThe White House ruled out both paths as legally unsound.\nLately, LGBT rights activists have urged Obama to ban discrimination against gay and transgender federal employees, an issue the White House has preferred to address through Congress."}
