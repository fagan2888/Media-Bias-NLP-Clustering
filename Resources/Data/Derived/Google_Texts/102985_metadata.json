When we saw the revenue shortfall...we thought this was a good opportunity that there are good ways to put more revenue into the state budget without raising taxes....\"\n\nShe says it would also allow current funds to be shifted elsewhere in the budget...\n\n\"....if we accepted Medicaid expansion, the funding would be coming from the federal government rather than state revenues. It would allow some of the (money) that is currently going into Medicaid programs to be moved over and used in other programs in the state....\"\n\n.
