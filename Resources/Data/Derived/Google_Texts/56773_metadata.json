Those guys fire strikes that just nip the black of home plate. This fools batters. Hitters don\u2019t know whether to swing or not. Make an offering and you might not even nick the pitch as it crosses the plate. Sit back on your heels and take the pitch? Well, frozen pizza. You risk being rung up on strikes on a pitch that just catches the strike zone.\n\nPainting the corners.\n\nHouse Republicans approved a surfeit of tax-reform measures recently, all tied thematically to tax day, April 15. Republicans voted to eliminate the so-called death tax, the penalty wealthy families pay in real estate and other holdings when a relative dies. They voted on a \u201cTaxpayer\u2019s Bill of Rights\u201d to give Americans more options when dealing with the IRS. They approved a measure to allow for additional fairness when deducting state and local taxes. Finally, the House OK\u2019d a plan to make permanent the deduction of those taxes.\n\n\u201cI think we've got a better approach on the Republican side. Reduce the tax burden that American families have to pay and raise their incomes through a better economy and better jobs,\u201d trumpeted House Speaker Rep. John Boehner, R-Ohio.\n\n\u201cWith tax day right around the corner, I certainly heard a lot about taxes, and the question as to when Congress is going to pass tax reform --which across the board, people recognize as long overdue,\u201d opined House Republican Conference Chairwoman Cathy Rep. McMorris Rodgers, R-Wash. \u201cWe really do need a tax code that puts people first.\u201d\n\nAll well and good. Except these exercises are far from fundamentally reforming the nation\u2019s tax system. In other words, Republicans mimicked Clayton Kershaw or Johnny Cueto, painting the corners. They worked the edges of the plate when it comes to tax policy.\n\nBut executing a major retrench of the nation\u2019s tax laws isn\u2019t baseball. Republicans and many Democrats have crowed for decades that Congress needs to drastically overhaul America\u2019s tax system. Congress hasn\u2019t ushered to passage a major piece of tax reform legislation since 1986. And to do tax reform, lawmakers can\u2019t nibble around the edges of the plate like Messrs. Kershaw and Cueto. No. They need to take a different approach and serve up a real watermelon, right down Broadway. Down the heart of the plate. Such an approach is precisely the opposite tactic pitchers want to take with good hitters like Mike Trout or Giancarlo Stanton. But dusting the corners won\u2019t work when it comes to tax reform.\n\n\u201cEverything is on the table except raising taxes,\u201d declared House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., when asked by reporters at a recent forum about what shape a potential tax-reform package might take.\n\nRyan\u2019s the guy to ask. He, along with Senate Finance Committee Chairman Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, would be tasked with crafting a big tax-reform bill. But in a similar setting with scribes over the winter, Ryan signaled that even though we\u2019re not even four months into the 114th Congress, time for a major bill is already running short.\n\n\u201cTax reform is a 2015 thing for sure,\u201d said Ryan when asked about a possible timetable. \u201cIt has to be done by the end of the summer \u2026 . If it goes back past summer, it\u2019s hard to see how that gets done.\u201d\n\nRyan believes that tax reform must be comprehensive. Reporters asked him if it was possible to alter some specific tax areas in lieu of a grand package.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s helpful to do tax reform overall if you carve out sections,\u201d said Ryan about changing some overseas business rates. \u201cIf you just do a narrow, international (bill), that may make it harder to do tax reform later.\u201d\n\nSo what is Congress left with? Painting the corners, which is what the House voted on last week -- timing the votes to coincide with April 15.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re going to reform this tax code sometime between one and three years\u201d from now,\u201d said Ryan, even arguing that tax reform was the real way to fix the Internal Revenue Service.\n\nBut don\u2019t doubt Ryan\u2019s determination to do tax reform in the near future. In fact, he said one of the reasons he elected to forgo a presidential bid next year was because of his commitment to authoring tax reform.\n\n\u201cI see a window of getting things done and I don\u2019t want to be clouded by\u201d running for president, Ryan said.\n\nReforming the tax code resides as one of the most powerful mantras of the GOP. But it\u2019s an elusive goal. The revolutionary, Republican House and Senate of the mid-1990s didn\u2019t pull it off. Nor did Republicans when they had President George W. Bush in the White House for six years. Perhaps not reforming the tax code actually works to the GOP\u2019s advantage. Consider all of the various tax-reform ideas spewing from bona fide or possible Republican presidential candidates. The GOP seemingly \u201cowns\u201d the tax issue. Presidential hopefuls can talk ad nauseam about fixing the tax code. Eliminating shelters. Lowering rates. Making the code flatter and fairer. And yet hold none of the responsibility -- because it makes for a fabulous issue -- be it on the presidential stump or campaigning for a House seat at a fire department fish fry.\n\nListen to Boehner from earlier this week in an interview on Fox:\n\n\u201cWe want tax reform. It\u2019s critically important for our country. We\u2019ve got a tax system that no one understands. Not even the IRS understands,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we had a flatter, simpler tax code that would allow 95 percent of the American people to do their own taxes, we\u2019d have a much healthier economy.\u201d\n\nOf course, the trouble with actually reforming the tax code is the sheer breadth and scope of the problem. Fixing the code will require buy-in from both parties. Various groups and well heeled K Street lobbyists will push to protect their respective interests. In other words, there is a lot of political muscle that opponents can deploy against tax reform. And that\u2019s what makes it the Herculean challenge.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to do tax reform without the active involvement of the administration,\u201d criticized Boehner during his Fox interview.\n\nThere is, however, a possibly unique parliamentary option lingering that could smooth some rough roads if Republican leaders elect to tackle tax reform this year. It\u2019s called budget reconciliation.\n\nMembers from both bodies will soon vote to blend separate budgets crafted by the House and Senate. \u201cReconciliation\u201d is a special process that lives in the congressional budget bailiwick. Congressional leaders sometimes use budget reconciliation to advance major, nettlesome issues. The quintessential rights of senators are unlimited debate and an unlimited amendment process. But budget reconciliation quashes that. It curbs debate, virtually eliminates Senate filibusters and reduces the threshold to adopt almost anything to a simple majority. It sets aside the super-majorities that often derail the Senate\u2019s legislative aspirations.\n\nRemember when Democrats ran the show on Capitol Hill and struggled to approve ObamaCare? Guess how they ultimately did it? They used the Senate\u2019s budget reconciliation process.\n\nCongressional leaders haven\u2019t quite put the kibosh on tucking an option to do tax reform into the pending, final version of the budget, called \u201creconciliation instructions.\u201d But it\u2019s possible.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019d like to have a little more flexibility when it comes to what we use reconciliation for,\u201d said Boehner when asked whether Congressional negotiators would leave the door open for tax reform via reconciliation.\n\nBoehner refused to elaborate on what he meant by \u201cflexibility,\u201d whether he was referring to tax reform, repealing the Affordable Care Act (ACA) or something else.\n\n\u201cFlexibility,\u201d Boehner reiterated when asked for clarification, drawing laughter.\n\nHouse Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy also kept it vague when asked for more detail of the GOP\u2019s reconciliation goals, during a weekly colloquy on the floor with Minority Whip Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Md., about the House schedule. But McCarthy did go a little further than Boehner when he huddled with reporters.\n\n\u201cI want as much flexibility as possible,\u201d said the California Republican when asked about the GOP\u2019s approach.\n\nBut then McCarthy got specific, perhaps even tipping his hand a bit.\n\n\u201cI would like to have the option to do more than repeal the ACA,\u201d McCarthy said when speaking about reconciliation. \u201cI look forward to getting tax reform done. The last time, they used reconciliation.\u201d\n\nFor his part, Ryan\u2019s not committed to reconciliation, saying at a winter-time gathering with reporters: \u201cI don\u2019t know if we\u2019ll use reconciliation\u201d and \u201cWe probably don\u2019t need to.\u201d\n\nBut Hatch was skeptical reconciliation was on the table this round for tax reform.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not opposed,\u201d Hatch said. \u201cBut there are enough things we have to work through.\u201d\n\n\n\nHowever, Hatch indicated he willing to use the reconciliation maneuver if leaders indicated that a tax-reform plan was ripe.\n\nThat said, a relative, new optimism for wrestling with seemingly intractable issues is gripping Washington. Such was the case when Republicans and Democrats came together to work out a bipartisan deal on the so-called \u201cdoc fix.\u201d That\u2019s the expensive and controversial proposition in the Medicare system. The pact staved off what could have been a public-health and actuarial nightmare.\n\n\u201cThis tells me there\u2019s a formula there for getting things done, and maybe tax reform,\u201d Ryan said shortly after the House adopted the doc fix replacement in late March.\n\n\u201cIt was a good opportunity to work with Ms. Pelosi in a bipartisan way to do the right thing for the country,\u201d said Boehner, speaking about House Minority Leader Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. \u201cThe window\u2019s never closed.\u201d\n\nAnd so congressional observers are watching the budget to see what sort of options for reconciliation wind up in the final package. Will there be the possibility of a big, fat, fastball, grooved right down the middle of the plate for tax reform? Or will lawmakers revert to the Rembrandt status of Kershaw and Cueto, merely painting the corners.", "article_metadata": {"classification": "/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES/Legislation", "dcterms.modified": "2015-04-25 11:49:05 EDT", "dcterms.abstract": "If this were baseball, they might say House Republicans are painting the corners when it comes to changing the tax code.", "twitter": {"description": "If this were baseball, they might say House Republicans are painting the corners when it comes to changing the tax code.", "creator": "@foxnews", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/04/25/overhauling-tax-code-is-trendy-on-presidential-stump-but-real-issue-is-will.html", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-news/politics/2015/04/25/overhauling-tax-code-is-trendy-on-presidential-stump-but-real-issue-is-will/_jcr_content/par/featured-media/media-0.img.jpg/0/0/1438303060215.jpg?ve=1", "title": "Overhauling tax code trendy on presidential stump, but real issue is will House GOP finally pass major reform?", "site": "@foxnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.publisher": "Fox News", "parsely-metadata": "{\"tags\":[\"/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES/Legislation\"],\"author\":\"Chad Pergram\",\"subSection\":\"politics\",\"title\":\"Overhauling tax code trendy on presidential stump, but real issue is will House GOP finally pass major reform?\",\"image_url\":\"http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-news/politics/2015/04/25/overhauling-tax-code-is-trendy-on-presidential-stump-but-real-issue-is-will/_jcr_content/par/featured-media/media-0.img.jpg/0/0/1438303060215.jpg?ve=1\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-04-25T14:27:16Z\",\"link\":\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/04/25/overhauling-tax-code-is-trendy-on-presidential-stump-but-real-issue-is-will.html\",\"type\":\"article\",\"identifier\":\"8aff113a-48cb-4abb-b03b-813af83532f8\",\"section\":\"politics\"}", "prism.aggregationType": "subsection", "prism.channel": "fnc", "dc.description": "If this were baseball, they might say House Republicans are painting the corners when it comes to changing the tax code.", "dc.identifier": "8aff113a-48cb-4abb-b03b-813af83532f8", "dc.language": "en-US", "pagetype": "article", "classification-isa": "legislation", "description": "If this were baseball, they might say House Republicans are painting the corners when it comes to changing the tax code.", "prism.section": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 113186182048399}, "dc.source": "FoxNews.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "dc.title": "Overhauling Tax Code Trendy On Presidential Stump, But Real Issue Is Will House Gop Finally Pass Major Reform?", "dcterms.created": "2015-04-25 11:49:05 EDT", "og": {"site_name": "Fox News", "description": "If this were baseball, they might say House Republicans are painting the corners when it comes to changing the tax code.", "title": "Overhauling tax code trendy on presidential stump, but real issue is will House GOP finally pass major reform? | Fox News", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/04/25/overhauling-tax-code-is-trendy-on-presidential-stump-but-real-issue-is-will.html", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-news/politics/2015/04/25/overhauling-tax-code-is-trendy-on-presidential-stump-but-real-issue-is-will/_jcr_content/par/featured-media/media-0.img.jpg/0/0/1438303060215.jpg?ve=1", "type": "article"}, "dc.type": "Text.Article", "dc.date": "2015-04-25", "parsely-page": "{\"tags\":[\"/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES/Legislation\"],\"author\":\"Chad Pergram\",\"subSection\":\"politics\",\"title\":\"Overhauling tax code trendy on presidential stump, but real issue is will House GOP finally pass major reform?\",\"image_url\":\"http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-news/politics/2015/04/25/overhauling-tax-code-is-trendy-on-presidential-stump-but-real-issue-is-will/_jcr_content/par/featured-media/media-0.img.jpg/0/0/1438303060215.jpg?ve=1\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-04-25T14:27:16Z\",\"link\":\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/04/25/overhauling-tax-code-is-trendy-on-presidential-stump-but-real-issue-is-will.html\",\"post_id\":\"8aff113a-48cb-4abb-b03b-813af83532f8\",\"type\":\"article\",\"section\":\"politics\"}", "dc.creator": "Chad Pergram"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdf5a\"", "article_summary": "If this were baseball, they might say House Republicans are painting the corners when it comes to changing the tax code.\nAnd to do tax reform, lawmakers can\u2019t nibble around the edges of the plate like Messrs.
