He credited the backlash to Obamacare in 2010 with generating an unprecedented wave of top-tier Republican politicians, from Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker to Ohio Gov. John Kasich.\n\n\u201cI was doing fundraising calls \u2026 to a bunch of former chairs going back to the mid-1960s and almost all of them agree that people are holding out longer than usual in making their selections and settling on a candidate,\u201d said Jeff Kaufmann, the GOP chairman in Iowa, an early state already inundated by candidates. \u201cWith 17 Republicans now in the race, I really think the polls are nearly meaningless in terms of predictability for [the Iowa Caucus date of] Feb. 1. I think it\u2019s going to be fluid until late fall.\u201d\n\nFor all of the Republican National Committee\u2019s best-laid plans to have a streamlined and efficient primary process after a lengthy and bruising 2012 primary season, the size of the 2016 field \u2014 the largest in modern presidential campaign history \u2014 is working to unravel those efforts. Many chairs expect that it will be well into the spring of 2016 before the field is seriously winnowed, even though few expect all 17 candidates to still be in the contest by early next year.\n\nThe absence of an obvious front-runner is an observation that many state chairs made. While Donald Trump has opened up a lead in recent polls and sucked up oxygen from other candidates, few state chairs expect him to be the nominee \u2014 though, for the most part, they\u2019ll say so only privately.\n\nIt might not be the orderly procession the RNC envisioned, but the chairs aren\u2019t exactly watching with alarm. If anything, they view the sprawling field as a positive.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a sense of dread about where things are,\u201d said John Hancock, chairman of the Missouri GOP. \u201cI\u2019m very optimistic that we\u2019ve got some phenomenal candidates who are going to wear very well as they get more and more exposure.\u201d\n\nThe chairs expect the deep GOP presidential bench to inject energy into the party and force campaigns to visit often-ignored states under the assumption that the nominating contest will be prolonged well beyond the traditional early voting states.\n\n\u201cThere are no clear front-runners,\u201d said Diana Waterman, chairwoman of the Maryland GOP. \u201cIn a field of 16 or so candidates, it\u2019s really hard to have a strong front-runner.\u201d\n\nAnother factor contributing to the general uncertainty is the fact the primary rules are still being written and some dates are still being finalized.\n\nTo win the Republican nomination, candidates will have to amass enough delegates to ensure victory at the party convention in July. But many states that are typically primary afterthoughts are still in the process of revising the methods by which they allocate delegates, in part because they expect an extended nomination process \u2014 and they view the wide open 2016 primary as a unique opportunity to capture attention from delegate-hungry candidates.\n\nNebraska, for example, is considering a shift to a winner-take-all system that could enhance the impact of the sparsely populated Midwestern state\u2019s May primary. Chairman Dan Welch said his state is accustomed to being overlooked but might get more attention this time if the rules are altered. Similarly, Minnesota Chairman Kevin Downey noted that his state updated its rules to bind convention delegates to the results of a March 1 straw poll \u2014 unlike last time, when the state\u2019s delegates went to the 2012 GOP convention unbound. That change adds heft to the party\u2019s caucuses and addresses concerns that erupted in 2012, when several states saw delegates veer from the choice of their party\u2019s voters.\n\nThe already complicated patchwork of rules \u2014 some states award all delegates to the winner, others assign them proportionally, and those in a third group use a hybrid approach \u2014 will continue to be tweaked over the next two months. States are under orders from the RNC to finalize their rules for awarding delegates by Oct. 1, and several are seeking approval and support for their updated plans.\n\nExpectations are running highest in the South as candidates eye March 1, the date of the so-called SEC primary, when a host of often-overlooked states in that region will vote on the same day.\n\n\u201cThe move to an earlier primary has sparked interest by many of the candidates,\u201d said Doyle Webb, the Arkansas GOP chairman. \u201cWe\u2019ve had at least 10 of the announced candidates contact us directly for information [on how to file, the filing fee, the process]. We\u2019re excited to see all the candidates, but we\u2019ll wait and see who files in Arkansas.\u201d\n\nAdded Tennessee GOP Chairman Ryan Haynes, \u201cWe anticipate that Tennessee is going to get a lot of attention \u2026 Tennessee is a relatively easy state to get on the ballot, and campaigns are starting the process much earlier than they have in prior presidential elections. They\u2019re reaching out to the state party about what the process is, how to get the delegates lined up. The process seems to be starting much earlier this time than four years ago.\u201d\n\nThe Republican Party of Virginia, which also chose to compete on March 1, has already disseminated detailed ballot information to all of the campaigns, said Chairman John C. Whitbeck Jr., something that \u201creminded [campaigns] strongly to get started now on their work.\u201d\n\nOther states are still sorting out when to host their primary or caucus, and how to position themselves to attract the maximum number of candidates. For example, Kansas didn\u2019t decide until the end of last month on the caucus date (now set for March 5).\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been contacted by almost all of the campaigns, and ones we\u2019ve seen have been a lot more active in Kansas,\u201d said state Chairman Kelly Arnold, who says Ted Cruz is organizing effectively in Kansas, and that Scott Walker\u2019s Midwestern appeal is resonating there. \u201cIt is early \u2014 it\u2019s not one of the first few states, it\u2019s only 40 delegates \u2014 but we\u2019re becoming a strong state on the national stage.\u201d\n\nCox noted that New York state just agreed to set its primary for April 19, a week ahead of Pennsylvania and five weeks later than the pivotal contest in Florida. He argued that the move positions relatively late-voting New York \u2014 typically an afterthought despite its trove of 95 delegates \u2014 to win considerable attention from candidates, since few other states are holding contests in the intervening weeks. It\u2019s all predicated, he noted, on a slew of viable candidates remaining after those early contests.\n\nNew York isn\u2019t the only big state looking to cast a bigger-than-usual footprint this year as a result of the contours of the 17 candidate field.\n\n\u201cJust by the number of candidates running \u2026 Texas will be a player in this,\u201d said Lone Star State GOP Chairman Tom Mechler. \u201cWe\u2019re delighted. We always felt like the strongest Republican state in the union should have some impact on the nomination \u2014 and, in this election, we think that will be the case.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "Republican state party chairs say the 2016 nomination fight is as unpredictable and wide-open as any they can remember.", "title": "A GOP primary in chaos", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/08/a-primary-like-no-other-120977.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2015/08/04/lede_150803_vote_sign_ap_1160.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Republicans,2016 Elections,Fox News,2016 Presidential Debates,GOP,White House", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "Republican state party chairs say the 2016 nomination fight is as unpredictable and wide-open as any they can remember.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThe move to an earlier primary has sparked interest by many of the candidates,\u201d said Doyle Webb, the Arkansas GOP chairman.\n\u201cJust by the number of candidates running \u2026 Texas will be a player in this,\u201d said Lone Star State GOP Chairman Tom Mechler.\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen this number of candidates,\u201d said New York State Republican Party Chairman Ed Cox, noting he\u2019s been involved in Republican politics since 1968.\nOn the eve of the first Republican primary debate, state party leaders across the nation say the 2016 contest is in a state of flux, as unpredictable and wide open as any they can remember.\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a sense of dread about where things are,\u201d said John Hancock, chairman of the Missouri GOP."}
