Rival Infosys also reported slower annual revenue growth of 6.9 percent from 24.2 percent in 2013/14.\n\nBoth TCS and Infosys declined to comment ahead of their quarterly results.\n\nResearchers Gartner estimate global IT spending will this year fall 5.5 percent from a year ago to $3.5 trillion, which means competition for booming sectors like healthcare will be fierce.\n\nAnalysts, however, say Indian outsourcing firms must address U.S. concerns about privacy, and spell out how they intend to protect sensitive medical and personal data for U.S. patients that will be processed half a world away in India.\n\n\"The best chance that Indian companies will have is to make acquisitions of companies that specialize in healthcare technologies,\" said Kevin Parikh, chief executive of U.S.-based management consulting firm Avasant.\n\n(Additional reporting by Tripti Kalro in BENGALURU; Editing by Sumeet Chatterjee)", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Nivedita Bhattacharjee", "Author": "Nivedita Bhattacharjee", "DCSext.PageNumber": 1, "twitter": {"description": "India's IT outsourcing firms are betting on U.S. President Barack Obama's healthcare reform to rev up revenue growth which is slowing as the $146 billion industry's key financial and manufacturing clients spend less on software services.", "creator": "@ReutersIndia", "image": "http://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20150708&t=2&i=1062434444&w=&fh=545px&fw=&ll=&pl=&sq=&r=LYNXNPEB6702Y", "title": "India IT outsourcing firms seek booster shot from Obamacare", "site": "@ReutersIndia", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "DCSext.rChannel": "Article -
