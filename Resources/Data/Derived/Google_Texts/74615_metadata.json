As reported by the Waco Trib\u2026\n\nDespite the lack of a birth certificate, the state was able to verify Barber\u2019s citizenship by finding her birthday in a U.S. census taken in the 1940s, [Barber\u2019s son, Jimmy] Denton said. She also showed her Social Security card, two utility bills and her Medicare card.\n\nNow, if we can just get national media coverage for each and every one of the hundreds of thousands of registered voters who still don\u2019t have the requisite Photo ID now needed to vote under the Texas law. Or, as in the case with the Republican nominee for Governor in Arkansas during Tuesday\u2019s primary, perhaps we can just hire each one of those otherwise legal voters a staffer to take care of the problem.\n\nOriginal post:\n\nHere is just one more of the hundreds of thousands of reasons that have led the U.S. Department of Justice to file suit against Texas Republicans\u2019 polling place photo ID restriction law.\n\nThe same law had been previously blocked by the DOJ and again by a federal court under the federal Voting Rights Act, after the state\u2019s own data showed the law discriminated against racial minorities and others, while failing to deter actual voter fraud in the state.\n\nBut, literally minutes after SCOTUS gutted the heart of the Voting Rights Act last summer, the section that was used to strike down the law previously, Texas Republicans announced their intention to reenact the law that, of course, they knew to be discriminatory.\n\nAs the Waco Tribune reports, 92-year old Ruby Barber has tried, but has so far failed, to obtain one of those so-called \u201cfree\u201d photo IDs from the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS), now that one is required for her to cast her legal vote this year, as she has for decades, until now, without a problem.\n\nBarber\u2019s story is heartbreaking and maddening but, unfortunately, probably not entirely rare. The DOJ estimated, based on the state\u2019s supplied data when the federal agency blocked the law in 2012, \u201cthe total number of registered voters [in Texas] who lack a driver\u2019s license or personal identification card issued by DPS could range from 603,892 to 795,955.\u201d\n\nBarber\u2019s driver\u2019s license expired in 2010 and she\u2019s now having difficulty locating \u201cher nearly century-old birth certificate that she\u2019d need to obtain a voter ID under a new state law.\u201d As the New York Daily News reports, the details of Barber\u2019s story and her fight to try and cast her vote are simply absurd.\n\nA frail 92-year-old woman is the latest victim of new voter identification laws sweeping across the U.S. Ruby Barber, a senior citizen in the small town of Bellmead, Texas, has been unable to vote because she can\u2019t find her nearly century-old birth certificate that she\u2019d need to obtain a voter ID under a new state law. \u201cI\u2019m sure (my birth) was never reported because I was born in a farmhouse with a coal oil lamp,\u201d Barber, 92, told the Waco (Texas) Tribune. \u201cDidn\u2019t have a doctor, just a neighbor woman come in and (delivered) me.\u201d Barber visited the state\u2019s Department of Public Safety office last week to request the newly required election identification certificate, but was declined after she didn\u2019t have a birth certificate. Under Texas\u2019s new strict voter ID law, enacted in June 2013, all voters must show one of six forms of valid photo identification \u2013 including a driver\u2019s license, a passport, a military ID or concealed gun permit \u2013 to be able to vote. Those who lack a valid photo ID, can apply for an election identification certificate (EIC) \u2013 a process that requires a birth certificate or other proof of citizenship. Barber, unfortunately, no longer has any of the documents she\u2019d need to obtain a ballot. According to the Tribune, her driver\u2019s license expired in 2010 and her marriage license was lost in a 1992 house fire. She took her Medicare card, Social Security card and expired driver\u2019s license to state officials when she sought her EIC, but agency staff insisted she needed to provide a birth certificate. \u201cI\u2019ve voted all my life, and not to be able to vote, it just breaks my heart,\u201d Barber said of the possibility that she may not able to vote in this year\u2019s Texas gubernatorial election \u2013 expected to be a close race between Republican Greg Abbott and Democrat Wendy Davis.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Want another reason to abhor idiotic voter ID laws?
