Mazur. \u201cToday\u2019s final regulations phase in the standards to ensure that larger employers either offer quality, affordable coverage or make an employer responsibility payment starting in 2015 to help offset the cost to taxpayers of coverage or subsidies to their employees.\u201d\n\nThe new regulations also allow employers to offer coverage to only 70% of their workers in 2015. They will have to provide coverage to 95% of full-time workers in 2016.\n\nThe requirement that companies with more than 50 full-time workers provide insurance or pay a fine is designed to prevent firms from dropping health benefits once the government offers subsidies to help individuals buy coverage.\n\nThe law's authors worried that firms would be tempted to stop offering coverage, shifting the cost of healthcare to the government.\n\nUnder the law, large employers that do not provide insurance will be fined $2,000 per employee beyond the first 30 employees.\n\nThe new regulations are almost certain to provide new fuel to Republican critics of the law, who have charged repeatedly that the administration has exceeded its authority in selectively implementing parts of the law.\n\nBut administration officials said Monday that the law allows such adjustments.\n\n\u201cThe secretary has very broad authority to implement the tax law in a way that benefits tax administration, and we think the phase-in approach really is a way to administer the law better and enhance overall compliance,\u201d a senior Treasury Department official said.\n\nnoam.levey@latimes.com\n\nTwitter: @NoamLevey", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Obama administration to further delay healthcare employer mandate", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times", "author": "Los Angeles Times", "og": {"site_name": "latimes.com", "description": "WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration will phase in a requirement that large employers provide their workers with health benefits in 2015 and 2016, offering businesses more relief from the so-called employer mandate in the president\u2019s healthcare law .", "title": "Obama administration to further delay healthcare employer mandate", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/politicsnow/la-pn-obama-delay-healthcare-mandate-20140210-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-52f946c6/turbine/la-pn-obama-delay-healthcare-mandate-20140210", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp09.13", "twitter": {"site": "@latimes", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "robots": "index,follow", "keywords": "obama obamacare employer mandate", "fb": {"admins": 100000786395051, "page_id": 5863113009}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=373238146, app-argument=http://www.latimes.com/deeplinkid/79247432", "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2014-02-10", "Description": "WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration will phase in a requirement that large employers provide their workers with health benefits in 2015 and 2016, offering businesses more relief from the so-called employer mandate in the president\u2019s healthcare law.
