They found that the vast majority of their enrollees, 82 percent, were receiving subsidies for their premiums. According to the study, the only way to grow enrollment is to attract those who are not eligible for subsidies and who buy coverage directly.\n\n\u201cIf all states improved to at least the average of the 10 best-performing states, we estimate that total marketplace signups would reach 16.3 million,\u201d the report states. \u201cAssuming that around 10% of these people would not pay their first month\u2019s premium, this would translate into an \u201ceffectuated\u201d enrollment total of 14.7 million. This may provide a reasonable estimate of a ceiling on what marketplace enrollment could grow to over the next several years, assuming current levels of premium subsidies and outreach.\u201d\n\nThe report finds that enrollment growth has run under Congressional Budget Office projections and says substantial increases in enrollment are unlikely.\n\n\u201cIn March 2015, CBO projected average monthly marketplace enrollment of 21 million in calendar year 2016, though recently lowered that forecast to 13 million,\u201d the group states. \u201cEven if all states signed people up at the rate of the top 10 states, enrollment would still fall well short of projections by CBO, suggesting that those forecasts may have been unrealistic.\u201d\n\n\u201cAbsent a substantial boost in outreach or changes to the subsides to make insurance more affordable, substantial increases in marketplace enrollment are unlikely.\u201d\n\nIn response to this report, the Department of Health and Human Services touted their enrollment numbers. \u201cLast week we announced that almost 5 million new customers signed up for 2016 coverage,\u201d said a spokesperson from the agency. \u201cIn total, 12.7 million people signed up or automatically renewed their plans for 2016 coverage\u2014more than ever before.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Obamacare enrollment will hit an estimated ceiling of 14.7 million people over the next several years.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "Obamacare enrollment will hit an estimated ceiling of 14.7 million people over the next several years, according to a report from the Kaiser Family Foundation.
