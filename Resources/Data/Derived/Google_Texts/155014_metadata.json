The Medicaid Expansion program would raise the qualifying income to 138 percent of the poverty level, giving those Utahns access to healthcare. \u201cThey are stuck,\u201d Bell said, \u201cbelow the poverty line, but not qualified for Medicaid\u2026what reasonable proposal do we have for them?\u201d Bell noted that the only options for these individuals is to let illnesses and wounds go untreated, until they become so severe they are forced to go to the emergency room\u2014far more expensive than regular doctor visits, and the unpaid bills are passed along to everyone else in the form of higher insurance premiums and more expensive treatments. \u201cIt is estimated that 15 percent of insurance and hospital costs are just cost shifts from those who exclusively use the ER for healthcare\u2026that affects you, even if you do have insurance.\u201d Bell continued, after expressing frustration at the partisan sticking points he perceives within his own Party.\n\n\u201cI understand that there are ideological objections, but what is your solution for these people?\u201d Bell asked the group. \u201cCharity care is great to have, but you are never going to get donated brain surgery,\u201d Bell added. \u201cNor do you want to,\u201d quipped Dabakis. Bell was referencing a common talking point from many Republicans in Utah\u2019s House, who have maintained for the last few years that Utah\u2019s uninsured population could be covered by doctors providing free, donated services. However, none of these lawmakers have been able to produce a plan that would actually create a comprehensive program with charity care that would provide regular doctors office visits, medication, or emergency services through charity care.\n\nBell views Republican push-back as a side effect of Republican lawmakers never being directly challenged by their constituents to answer questions related to Medicaid. In general, he says, constituents misunderstand and mischaracterize Medicaid as a handout, missing the bigger issues surrounding healthcare for the working poor.\n\nDemocratic Representative Rebecca Chavez-Houck (Salt Lake City), who was also on the panel, noted that attitudes are starting to change, but that a critical mass of supporters is necessary to give Herbert the support he needs to ensure that, as she put it, the state \u201cdoes what is right for those that need medical coverage.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.2.8", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "In general, he says, constituents misunderstand and mischaracterize Medicaid as a handout, missing the bigger issues surrounding healthcare for the working poor.\nBell views Republican push-back as a side effect of Republican lawmakers never being directly challenged by their constituents to answer questions related to Medicaid.\nThe Medicaid Expansion program would raise the qualifying income to 138 percent of the poverty level, giving those Utahns access to healthcare.\nIt is estimated that 123,000 low-income Utahns are too poor to afford private insurance, but make slightly too much to qualify for Medicaid under the current system.\n\u201cCharity care is great to have, but you are never going to get donated brain surgery,\u201d Bell added."}
