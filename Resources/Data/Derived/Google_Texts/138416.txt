PITTSBURGH — Alexander Ovechkin picked up his NHL-leading 37th goal and assisted on Joel Ward’s winner with just over four minutes remaining to lift the Washington Capitals to a testy 3-1 win over the Pittsburgh Penguins on Tuesday night.

Ovechkin beat Marc-Andre Fleury on a breakaway in the first period. He then helped set up Ward’s first career goal against the Penguins as Washington improved to 3-0 against Pittsburgh. John Carlson added a short-handed empty-net goal with 11 seconds remaining.

Braden Holtby made 30 saves for the Capitals, who pulled within a point of the third-place Penguins in the crowded Metropolitan Division.

Steve Downie collected his 10th goal of the season for Pittsburgh. Marc-Andre Fleury stopped 29 shots but surrendered a pair of power-play goals, including Ward’s in a 5-on-3 with 4:13 to play.
