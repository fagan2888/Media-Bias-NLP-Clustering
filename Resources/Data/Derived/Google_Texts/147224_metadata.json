What\u2019s the occasion?\u201d\n\nI glance down at my bubblegum-pink polish and smile inwardly. The color is in celebration of the fact that I\u2019m giving birth to a baby girl on the 27th of April. I saw her on the ultrasound yesterday, distracted from the grainy image of my future daughter swimming in amniotic fluid by the emails piling up on my iPhone. I\u2019m 30 years old, single, and 22 weeks pregnant. I\u2019m also tenuously employed, and, like most American women in my situation, I\u2019m very nervous about what will happen to my job once work knows about my status as a mom-to-be.\n\n\"I was just in a pink mood.\" I shrug toward my co-worker.\n\nI work as a full-time in-office freelancer, meaning my job is in no way protected. My workplace broadly falls into the fashion industry; although my department is female-dominated, few of the women I work with have children. I got pregnant unexpectedly, on a one-night stand halfway through what was supposed to be a yearlong trip around the world. The father is a personal trainer from New Zealand. I don\u2019t know his last name, haven\u2019t spoken to him since that night, and hadn\u2019t planned to have sex with him when I\u2019d invited him back to the room I was renting after we\u2019d met at a bar. In the heat of the moment, one thing led to another. My supply of birth-control pills had run out in Montenegro two months prior, but I figured, based on where I was in my cycle, everything would be fine. Plus, I took the morning-after pill as soon as he left.\n\nFour weeks and five countries later, when I found out I was pregnant, I seriously considered having an abortion. I felt betrayed by my body. Then I thought about how I\u2019d always wanted kids, how the sight of the positive sign on the test made me feel more excited than panicked, how deep down, even if I didn\u2019t have a permanent address, having a baby seemed like the right move in my life.\n\nAnd just like that, I\u2019d made my decision: I knew that I wanted this baby, on my own. I didn't want to tell the father because I didn't know the father, not really. There was no way I wanted to force some sort of relationship with a stranger halfway around the world whom I'd only spent two hours of my life with. Selfish? Maybe. And while I kept his contact information and knew there could be a slight possibility I might change my mind on my decision to get in touch with him in the future, I also I knew I had other things in the moment to worry about, including getting my career back on track, ASAP. So at ten weeks pregnant, I flew back to New York City and threw myself into interviewing, trying not to hurl while ordering iced coffee during early morning meetings and wondering why every single person I knew in a position to hire suggested we meet for lunchtime sushi to catch up. Three weeks later, I found what seemed like the perfect gig: an open-ended, in-office freelance position as a copywriter that paid more than double what I\u2019d been making at my last full-time job. Although I have a high deductible, the insurance I purchased as a freelancer is covering the cost of maternity care (thanks, Obamacare!). During the interview, I made it clear that it was unlikely I could commit past the spring, but didn\u2019t give details as to why.\n\nNow, nearly three months into the job, the thought of announcing my pregnancy makes me feel like I have a lot to lose and very little to gain. So I haven\u2019t said anything. Thanks to a relatively long torso, an allegiance to a 500-crunch-a-day regimen as a teen, and sheer force of sucking-in will, I don\u2019t yet have a discernible bump. My doctor thinks I can maybe go another month without it being obvious. I wear maternity skinny jeans with an oversize sweater or button-down shirt almost every day. I make sure my hair is blown out, my makeup is perfect, my manicure is never chipped, and my accessories are immaculate. I hope that my attention to detail makes up for the fact that I\u2019m wearing a variation of the same outfit every day and am the only person at the office who eats snacks at her desk (to stop myself from fainting, which has been a recurring issue throughout my pregnancy). I wear six-inch heels and ignore that my feet are swelling. I fake-sipped Champagne at our holiday party and make up stories about what I did over the weekend instead of telling the truth \u2014 that while I used to go out, now I do what I like to call \u201cbumping out,\u201d where I wear a form-fitting maternity top as I run errands. I like the attention I receive; I like looking pregnant.\n\nIt\u2019s a different story Monday through Friday. It\u2019s no secret that the job world is hostile to parents-to-be. Pregnancy discrimination has reached the Supreme Court in the case of a UPS worker placed on unpaid leave after disclosing her pregnancy. The Chicago Board of Education is being sued for discrimination against pregnant teachers. A story line in a 2011 30 Rock episode had Jack Donaghy\u2019s pregnant wife, Avery Jessup, wear wizard robes to work during her third trimester to keep her pregnancy under wraps. And I\u2019ve seen it in my own career: the co-worker fired two weeks after she came back from maternity leave, the assumption that moms-to-be suddenly are no longer interested in assignments that require late hours or travel.\n\nI know that not wearing a wedding ring has bought me even more time before I have to tell \u2014 even if I may look a little bit pregnant, it\u2019s easy for co-workers to chalk it up to too many cookies rather than a bun in the oven. But if I were coupled up, at the very least, I\u2019d have someone to strategize with when it came to a work-life-balance plan, as well as to share the financial burden that comes with a baby-to-be. Just the thought of day care alone \u2014 the average annual cost is $15,000 in New York, but much higher in the actual city \u2014 makes me panic. The financial burden and stress about the future is intense. And that's why it just seems easier to at least go through my work life without a baby onboard.\n\nOf course, \"easier\u201d is relative. I threw up every other morning during my first trimester; an initially inconclusive genetic test result had me panicking during the first half of my second. And the worries keep piling up: At my last ultrasound, my doctor found that while my baby girl looks great, I have what\u2019s known as placenta previa, which is where the placenta covers the cervix. Not only does this lead to an almost-certain C-section delivery, it also means I have to be worried about internal hemorrhaging in the interim. Now, I cringe remembering my own clueless pre-pregnancy days, when I\u2019d ask clearly expecting colleagues how they were feeling or whether they knew if they were having a boy or a girl. It wasn\u2019t any of my business, and I had no idea about the internal struggles the women I spoke with may have been experiencing.\n\nI have told one person at work. (Once I heard the phrase \"possible hemorrhage\" from my doctor, I realized it was in my own best interest to let someone else know what was going on.) Sure, I didn\u2019t want to risk her blabbing to other colleagues \u2014 but I also didn\u2019t want anyone to find me covered in blood with no idea what was going on. She was surprised, excited \u2014 and just as in the dark as I was about how anyone we worked with would react.\n\nThat\u2019s the thing: This is the first time in my professional life I\u2019ve ever truly felt I was truly navigating uncharted territory. In the past, whenever I was ready to ask for a promotion or had trouble dealing with a difficult boss, it was easy to get advice from mentors who\u2019d been there and done that. But pregnancy seemed shrouded in secrecy, with every woman\u2019s story vastly different, and all dependent on her unique relationship with her bosses, her savvy networking and negotiating skills, or simply the fact that she'd done pregnancy the \u201cright\u201d way \u2014 waiting until she got a full-time gig with benefits, working the requisite year, knowing that maternity leave benefits were available for the taking.\n\nNot following the traditional script makes me feel completely uncertain, not just about my career, but about my life. Which is why at least part of the reason I\u2019ve kept it a secret \u2014 beyond the political and professional reasons, beyond the fact it simply hasn\u2019t come up \u2014 is because I\u2019m afraid my pregnancy will define me, and I\u2019m still trying to figure out what that means. In my \u201creal\u201d life, where everyone now knows I\u2019m pregnant, I\u2019m constantly peppered with questions I don\u2019t know how to answer, from whether I\u2019ve researched day-care options to where I plan on living when my lease runs out next fall. At work, I feel in control. I know what I\u2019m doing and I\u2019m good at it. I also like the fact there\u2019s a little corner of my life where I can still be the \u201cold\u201d me, where I can sympathize when a single co-worker talks about a date gone awry during a conversation in the office kitchen. While I do know how to be a fun single girl, I don\u2019t yet know how to be a mother. I\u2019m navigating this brave new in-between world one day \u2014 and one sideways glance at my profile view in my bathroom mirror to make sure the bump is still under wraps \u2014 at a time. I do sometimes worry that my two lives will collide \u2014 and sometimes I wish they would. It would at least put an end to the when do I tell drama I'm putting myself through.\n\nBut I\u2019m not delusional: I know that this baby is coming. I know it\u2019ll soon be obvious, and that I\u2019d rather announce it myself than have people wonder behind my back. And when I do, I sincerely hope they\u2019ll follow my lead and keep the focus on my work, not on my bump. I promise to do the same in the future for any co-workers who are probably pregnant, possibly freaking out, and clearly working for two.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#000", "description": "I feel I have a lot to lose and very little to gain.", "generator": "the-factory", "og": {"site_name": "The Cut", "description": "I feel I have a lot to lose and very little to gain.", "title": "Why I\u2019m Keeping My Pregnancy a Secret From Work As Long As I Possibly Can", "url": "http://nymag.com/thecut/2014/12/why-im-keeping-my-pregnancy-a-secret-from-work.html", "image": "http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2014/12/30/30-hiding-pregnancy-at-work.w1200.h630.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@TheCut", "image": "http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2014/12/30/30-hiding-pregnancy-at-work.w190.h190.2x.jpg", "description": "I feel I have a lot to lose and very little to gain.", "card": "summary", "title": "Why I\u2019m Keeping My Pregnancy a Secret From Work"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "The Cut", "fb": {"app_id": 343556435754245}, "msapplication-TileImage": "//cache.nymag.com/media/thecut/icon.144x144.png", "application-name": "The Cut", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "keywords": "pregnancy, motherhood, careers, first person", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Cut", "tag": "pregnancy,motherhood,careers,first person", "published_time": "2015-01-16T15:00:00.000Z"}, "topics": "topics-test, pregnancy, motherhood, careers, first person", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no"}, "article_summary": "And that's why it just seems easier to at least go through my work life without a baby onboard.\nI didn't want to tell the father because I didn't know the father, not really.\nI\u2019m 30 years old, single, and 22 weeks pregnant.\nI know what I\u2019m doing and I\u2019m good at it.\nPregnancy discrimination has reached the Supreme Court in the case of a UPS worker placed on unpaid leave after disclosing her pregnancy."}
