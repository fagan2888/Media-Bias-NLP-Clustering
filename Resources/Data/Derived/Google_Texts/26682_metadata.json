That would lower the top rate to just below 5 percent. Majority Republicans stripped increases on certain business and sales taxes used to help fund an income tax cut. The measure now goes to the GOP-dominated Senate. Ohio Public Radio's Andy Chow reports.\n\nThe two-year budget bill that tops $71 billion looks a lot different than the original proposal from Governor John Kasich. There\u2019s still an income tax cut - though at 6.3%, it\u2019s smaller than the 23% cut in Kasich\u2019s budget - and there are still tax breaks for small businesses. But proposed tax increases on cigarettes, oil and gas drilling, commercial activity and sales were all left on the cutting room floor.\n\n\n\nRepublican Representative and House Finance Committee Chair Ryan Smith of Gallipolis says the House put a lot of work and thought into their changes, especially the school funding portion, which added another $270 million to what the governor proposed. Smith believes this will give a major boost to struggling schools.\n\n\n\n\u201cI think that you\u2019re going to see districts that maybe only offered one foreign language or didn\u2019t have any advanced placement courses now will have the opportunity to do that,\u201d Smith said.\n\n\n\nWhen the governor unveiled his budget plan it included the controversial piece that sent a rift down party lines two years ago\u2014Medicaid expansion. Last time Kasich had to go through a smaller legislative panel to get support for the expansion. This time\u2014however\u2014it seemed like House Republican leaders were ready to play ball. But there were still some representatives in the Republican caucus who were bothered by the expansion\u2014which they relate back to the Affordable Care Act also known as ObamaCare.\n\n\n\nThat includes Republican Representative Nino Vitale of Urbana, who liked several parts of the budget but believed Medicaid expansion puts the federal government further in debt.\n\n\n\n\u201cBut unfortunately this one thing\u2014this ObamaCare Medicaid expansion is something that puts us in a position that creates the problem and continues the problem instead of us helping the problem,\u201d said Vitale.\n\n\n\nSmith says he understands the reservations behind supporting Medicaid expansion but believes the bill\u2019s added provisions to help bring people out of the system create a good balance.\n\n\n\n\u201cOne side you know we need to give health care to these folks that deserve health care. The other side says we can\u2019t afford to do this and we need to be fiscally minded let\u2019s try to figure out where we can land. I think that by putting the necessary reforms on here it gives us the sustainability into the future to at least have a further discussion on this,\u201d said Smith.\n\n\n\nDemocratic leaders, including Representative Denise Driehaus of Cincinnati, believe the budget falls short of truly helping all economic classes in Ohio.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis budget doesn\u2019t work for the middle class when the tax cuts in this budget primarily benefit the wealthy. This budget doesn\u2019t work for small businesses when the tax relief to small businesses isn\u2019t strategic,\u201d Driehaus said.\n\n\n\nThat was the general tone from House Democrats. Most leaders weren\u2019t overly upset about what was in the bill but what they believed to be lacking, such as expanded access to health care, measures to make college more affordable, and increased funding to local governments.\n\n\n\nWhile two Democrats voted for the budget bill the rest voted against it\u2014joined by a handful of Republicans.\n\n\n\nKasich\u2019s spokesperson Rob Nichols released a statement following the House vote. He said the governor is troubled by the bill which he said increases spending with rosy budget projections. Nichols also said removing Kasich\u2019s tax reform is a missed opportunity.\n\n\n\nHouse Speaker Cliff Rosenberger of Clarksville was asked about the possible changes the Senate could make\u2014such as bringing back the proposed increased tax on oil and gas drilling. The speaker said he respects the process and welcomes further discussion.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe do this every\u2014it\u2019s like Groundhog Day\u2014budgets come you try to do all this major policy in two or three short months and we\u2019re trying to say \u2018hey look we need to extenuate this a little bit, we need to examine some of this stuff a little longer,\u201d said Rosenberger.\n\n\n\nThe Senate has already started holding informal hearings on the budget.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"category": "News", "description": "The Ohio House has approved its version of the state budget that overhauls the governor's tax plans, steers more money to schools and revises certain", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://wcbe.org/post/ohio-house-approves-amended-state-budget-plan", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/wcbe/files/styles/medium/public/201504/1362089122_9503_OhioHouseElevated.JPG", "type": "article", "description": "The Ohio House has approved its version of the state budget that overhauls the governor's tax plans, steers more money to schools and revises certain", "title": "Ohio House Approves Amended State Budget Plan"}, "org_id": 0, "has_audio": 1, "author": "Jim Letizia, Associated Press, Ohio Public Radio", "wordCount": 823, "dc": {"title": "Ohio House Approves Amended State Budget Plan"}, "nid": 73323, "datePublished": "2015-04-23", "keywords": ", ,", "twitter": {"site": "@WCBE905Columbus", "card": "summary", "creator": "@WCBE905Columbus"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb2e9\"", "article_summary": "\u201cOne side you know we need to give health care to these folks that deserve health care.\nWhile two Democrats voted for the budget bill the rest voted against it\u2014joined by a handful of Republicans.\nThe two-year budget bill that tops $71 billion looks a lot different than the original proposal from Governor John Kasich.\nMajority Republicans stripped increases on certain business and sales taxes used to help fund an income tax cut.\nThe Ohio House has approved its version of the state budget that overhauls the governor's tax plans, steers more money to schools and revises certain health care policies."}
