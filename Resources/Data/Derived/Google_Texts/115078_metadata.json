Bernie Sanders praised the candidate\u2019s plan to \u201credistribute\u201d wealth.\n\n\u201cI really believe in his vision for the working class, expanding the middle class, and redistributing the income in this country,\u201d Erin Bilbray, a Democratic superdelegate for Sanders, told Varney, who was visibly flustered.\n\n\u201cOK, alright, you\u2019re going to take it off me and give it to somebody else. I got it. OK,\u201d Varney said, seemingly frustrated.\n\n\u201cNo, no, no, that\u2019s not what I\u2019m saying,\u201d Bilbray replied.\n\nBut the \u201cVarney & Co.\u201d host was not convinced, telling the Sanders supporter, \u201cLet\u2019s not beat around the bush.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe is going to take it off me. I already pay 60 percent of my income in taxes, and he wants more. Please, don\u2019t confuse the issue, he is going to take it off me and give it to somebody else. If you think that\u2019s OK, that\u2019s fine with me. I don\u2019t. Let me move on,\u201d Varney continued.\n\nIn response to his comments, Bilbray asserted that she is a middle-class, working mother who is \u201cexcited\u201d about Sanders\u2019 tax plan and his tuition-free college policy.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got two young daughters, and I know their college is going to be paid for,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd so I\u2019m very happy about that.\u201d\n\n\u201cOK. I\u2019ve got six kids, nine grandchildren, and I don\u2019t like paying 60 percent of my income in taxes, and I\u2019m damned if I\u2019m going to pay any more,\u201d Varney shot back.\n\nLater, the conversation turned toward morality.\n\n\u201cDo you think it\u2019s moral that I, as the father of six, grandparent of nine, 67 years old, works five or six days a week, 12 hours every day, you think it\u2019s moral for me to lose 6 cents on every 10 cents that I earn? And Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton want more. Explain the morality of that, will you?\u201d Varney inquired.\n\nBilbray responded by telling Varney that it\u2019s \u201cimmoral\u201d that people cannot find jobs with good hours and livable wages.\n\n\u201cDo you think that\u2019s got something to do with Obamacare?\u201d Varney asked before the conversation ended.\n\n\u2014\n\nFollow the author of this story on Twitter:\n\nFollow @tregp", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "Fox Business host Stuart Varney got a little, as he said, \"hot under the collar\" Monday when a supporter of Democratic presidential hopeful Vermont Sen.
