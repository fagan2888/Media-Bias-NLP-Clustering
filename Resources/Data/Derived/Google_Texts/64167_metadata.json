He was in his 80s and had dementia. Every morning Almodovar would lift Roy out of bed, bathe him, shave his face, and dress him in slacks and a button-down. \u201cTo the nines,\u201d she said. \u201cHe always looked good.\u201d As she does for most of her clients, Almodovar cooked meals for Roy, took him to the doctor, and tended to his increasingly demanding needs as his condition deteriorated. She was also with him in the hours before he died. \u201cIt\u2019s an emotional job. It\u2019s also real physical work,\u201d she said. When Almodovar, who lives in Cleveland, Ohio, gets home, around 9 p.m., sometimes later, her son is already asleep and she\u2019s exhausted. But, she said, she\u2019s happy to have work.\n\nJasmin Almodovar is the face of the women\u2019s jobs recovery. She works in the fastest-growing occupation in the largest job category for women: education and health services. With so many aging boomers, demand for home health aides is expected to skyrocket. The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects an expansion of 48 percent between 2012 and 2022. New positions primarily in service occupations have allowed women to regain more jobs than they lost during the recession\u2014and more than men have reclaimed. In the past few years, stories taking note of this new gender divide have peppered the media with headlines like \u201cWomen Reach Milestone in Job Market\u201d from the Wall Street Journal and \u201cIt\u2019s Women on Top in Jobs Recovery\u201d from the New York Post.\n\nAlmodovar\u2019s story is emblematic of the women\u2019s jobs recovery\u2014while work is plentiful, the pay and working conditions are often abysmal.\n\nBut a closer look reveals that the bounty of new jobs isn\u2019t such a triumph for women. Take Almodovar. The 35-year-old single mother earns just $9.50 an hour. (Minimum wage in Ohio is $7.95 and will rise to $8.10 on Jan. 1.) After more than a decade on the job, she has inched her way up from $7.85 an hour but hasn\u2019t had a raise in four years. Home health workers earn a median wage of less than $21,000 a year. That\u2019s well below the median annual wage across all occupations, which is almost $35,000, and just above the federal poverty line for a family of three. Similarly low wages are common in other growing job sectors that employ mostly women, including retail and food service. Also common to low-wage, mostly female work: long hours, unpredictable schedules, and no sick days or benefits. As Sarah Leberstein, a staff attorney at the National Employment Law Project, said, \u201cAll these new jobs show there\u2019s a real need for workers and there are some bright spots as far as job creation, especially in female-dominated sectors\u2014but not for job quality.\u201d Almodovar\u2019s story is emblematic of the women\u2019s jobs recovery\u2014while work is plentiful, the pay and working conditions are often abysmal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe most troubling aspect of Almodovar\u2019s job is the nine to 12 hours of work she isn\u2019t paid for each week. The time it takes Almodovar to drive from house to house between clients is off the clock, even though the travel is for work. She averages 1\u00bd hours in the car on each of the six days a week she works, and that adds up fast. Almodovar can lose up to $456 a month.\n\nThere are other ways Almodovar misses out on pay. If she\u2019s sick and has to stay home, she\u2019s not covered. If a client suddenly must be hospitalized, she\u2019s out those shifts. If a client goes to a nursing home or dies, the company she works for doesn\u2019t guarantee her another client right away, and she isn\u2019t paid without one. And despite working 60 hours a week at times, in her 11 years as a home health care worker, Almodovar has never been paid overtime. (Federal lawmakers have exempted home-based caregivers from many protections under the Fair Labor Standards Act. However, the Department of Labor recently ordered these workers included; the new regulations go into effect in mid-2015.)\n\nAlmodovar, a single mother, is compensated for 47 hours a week and earns about $22,000 a year before taxes. That barely covers her bills: her share of the rent is $320\u2014a few years ago she took in a friend, a single mother with four kids, as a roommate to cut costs\u2014plus her cellphone, food, cable, and utilities combined with clothes, school, and sports supplies for her 12-year-old son, Cortez. Because of the Affordable Care Act, Almodovar has just signed up for the first health insurance she\u2019s had in years. But the $80 a month she\u2019ll pay strains her pocketbook for what doesn\u2019t seem like real coverage. She could only afford a skimpy policy with high copayments and a steep deductible. \u201cI can\u2019t pay $50 to go see the doctor,\u201d she said. She will only use it, she said, if there\u2019s a catastrophic emergency.\n\nTo get health coverage, many low-wage workers shave their hours just enough to qualify for Medicaid. But Almodovar can\u2019t afford to. \u201cFood stamps, Medicaid\u2014that\u2019s not going to pay for gas. If something goes wrong with my truck, I can\u2019t give the mechanic my food stamp card,\u201d she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nIn today\u2019s labor market there are what seem like conflicting developments for female workers. Gender inequality has declined\u2014women have more access to jobs and more women have advanced degrees than ever before\u2014but in many cases this is because pay, benefits, and working conditions have gotten worse across the board, including for men.\n\n\u201cWomen\u2019s gains are happening in a period when the labor market has deteriorated,\u201d said Ruth Milkman, a sociology and labor studies professor at the City University of New York Graduate Center. \u201cGender inequality has lessened but overall inequality\u201d\u2014between rich and poor\u2014\u201chas increased dramatically.\u201d Milkman pointed out that income polarization isn\u2019t a new development, but rather one of the deindustrialization, deunionization, and deregulation that reaches back to the 1970s. \u201cThis is a long-term trend but it was accelerated by the recession,\u201d she said.\n\nEven still, according to the National Women\u2019s Law Center, women in low-paid jobs suffer a wage gap of 13 percent compared to men in these same positions.\n\nNot surprisingly, the long hours, tough conditions, and small paychecks affect many aspects of life. \u201cI don\u2019t see my son a lot,\u201d said Almodovar. \u201cI\u2019ve missed basketball games, football, awards ceremonies, performances.\u201d During the week they spend just one or two hours together a day. Most often he\u2019s asleep when she gets home. Sunday is their only real time (Almodovar works on Saturdays), which they spend at home or the park, doing activities that don\u2019t cost money. They have a big family meal on Sunday night\u2014\u201cIt\u2019s like Thanksgiving,\u201d Almodovar said\u2014because she finally has time to cook. Cortez is forgiving but often tells his mom he wishes she didn\u2019t work so much. He says it\u2019s not fair. \u201cI give my clients more time than my own family,\u201d Almodovar said. \u201cThat hurts.\u201d\n\nFor the post-recession jobs gains to be a real recovery for women like Almodovar, it will take more than high numbers of hires. \u201cWe often hear politicians talk about the great need to add jobs back,\u201d said Leberstein, the employment lawyer. \u201cBut we haven\u2019t paid enough attention or put enough pressure on companies to make sure the jobs they\u2019re creating are good enough.\u201d\n\nPressure, in legislative terms, means establishing new labor standards, including \u201cfair scheduling laws so employers would have to give employees their schedules ahead of time,\u201d said Joan Entmacher, vice president for family economic security at the National Women\u2019s Law Center, plus guarantees of minimum hours if a worker is on call.\n\nAlmodovar, who has joined the Fight of $15, a campaign run by the Service Employees International Union to agitate for a higher hourly rate for low-wage workers in the service sector, hopes change is imminent. \u201cAs it is now,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019ve worked all week, I\u2019ve paid my bills but there\u2019s no fallback money, there is no what-if money, no emergency money. In my employer\u2019s eyes I\u2019m making enough, but me, I\u2019m struggling every week.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.subheadline": "The jobs recovery was supposed to be great for women.
