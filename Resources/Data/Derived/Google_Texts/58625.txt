The Hoboken Police Department is hosting its Junior Police Academy from Monday through Aug. 8 for residents ages 12 to 15.

This year, the state Police Aviation Unit, FBI, Hudson County Prosecutor's Office Homicide Unit and the Hoboken Volunteer Ambulance Corps will have representatives instructing the "new recruits" at Stevens Institute of Technology during the two-week program.

Forty applicants for the program were chosen through a public lottery on the Hoboken Police Department's website.

"They'll get to go on a gun simulator machine and a driving simulator machine that will simulate driving a police car and shooting a firearm," Hoboken Police Officer Daniel Simone III said.

Other law enforcement agencies will show the kids their equipment and possibly do demonstrations, he added.

The Prosecutor's Office will show the recruits a mock crime scene and have a mock trial in relation to the crime. Additionally, all the recruits will be certified in CPR upon completion of the Junior Police Academy program.

"They'll experience what it's like to go to a scene and take notes, and then be questioned on it," Simone said.

The participants will also

be brought to the 9/11 Memorial in New York, Simone

said, to see what the first responders did when the towers collapsed.

Michael Fowlin, a motivation speaker at the Junior Police Academy, will present exciting programs on race, discrimination, violence prevention and personal identity.

The guest speaker at the Junior Police Academy graduation will be legendary St. Anthony High School basketball coach Bob Hurley, a former parole officer.
