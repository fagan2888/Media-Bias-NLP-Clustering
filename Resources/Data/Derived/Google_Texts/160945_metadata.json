The global population of great whites has been in recovery since 1990.\n\nOne of the key components in this environmental success story is the passage of the Marine Mammal Protection Act in 1972. With the legislation, seal and sea lion populations began to rebound along the West Coast. Great white sharks eat both seals and sea lions and having more food available most likely boosted their comeback.\n\nA healthy shark population makes for a more balanced ecosystem, leading to healthier oceans that support all lives, both human and non-human. Oceans produce over half of the oxygen in the atmosphere and absorb the majority of carbon in it.\n\nThe increase in the number of sharks suggests that some of the damage humans have caused in the oceans has been reversed. However, it will take a while for sharks to rebuild their populations completely. It takes sharks at least eight years to reach a reproductive age and gestation periods can last 18 months.\n\nEven though \u201cSharknado: Oh Hell No!\u201d is getting awful reviews this week, everyone should applaud this other bit of shark-related news.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "While recent headlines about the above average number of shark attacks in the U.S. this year may have rethinking your summer vacation, the incidents could be good news for the ocean\u2019s ecosystem.", "title": "Why Shark Attacks Have a Silver Lining", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/07/23/Why-Shark-Attacks-Have-Silver-Lining", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/jaws-shark-cage.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/07/23/Why-Shark-Attacks-Have-Silver-Lining", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/jaws-shark-cage.jpg", "creator": "@milliedent", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "While recent headlines about the above average number of shark attacks in the U.S. this year may have rethinking your summer vacation, the incidents could be good news for the ocean\u2019s ecosystem.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Conservation measures implemented to prevent the decline of great white sharks are paying off, scientists have found.\nA healthy shark population makes for a more balanced ecosystem, leading to healthier oceans that support all lives, both human and non-human.\nGreat white sharks eat both seals and sea lions and having more food available most likely boosted their comeback.\nWhen That Shark BitesWhile recent headlines about the above average number of shark attacks in the U.S. this year may have rethinking your summer vacation, the incidents could be good news for the ocean\u2019s ecosystem.\nThe global population of great whites has been in recovery since 1990."}
