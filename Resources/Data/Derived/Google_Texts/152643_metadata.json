Bautista said he didn\u2019t consider the problem to be serious.\n\n\u201cIf I would\u2019ve run it out I probably would\u2019ve strained it,\u201d Bautista said. \u201cI think I did the right thing.\u201d\n\nAfter Bautista\u2019s departure, Toronto had to use catcher Russell Martin at second base in the ninth.\n\nAll-Star shortstop Troy Tulowitzki, acquired by Toronto from Colorado, was not active and is expected to make his Blue Jays debut on Wednesday.\n\nToronto is 10-22 in one-run games.\n\nThe Phillies won their first game after trading All-Star closer Jonathan Papelbon to Washington and got their ninth victory in 10 games since the All-Star break.\n\nMorgan stopped a four-start winless streak and Cody Asche drove in two runs for the Phillies, who had lost their previous eight games against Toronto.\n\nThe Blue Jays came in batting .290 against left-handers but couldn\u2019t get the job done against Morgan.\n\n\u201cHe shut us down us as well as any lefty has all year,\u201d manager John Gibbons said.\n\nMorgan (2-2) allowed two runs and five hits in six innings to win for the first time since his major league debut, June 21 against St. Louis.\n\n\u201cHe pitched very well,\u201d interim manager Pete Mackanin said.\n\nMaking his fourth start for Toronto, left-hander Felix Doubront (1-1) allowed three runs and six hits in four-plus innings. Doubront has not won in his past three outings.\n\n\u201cHe lost the zone and started scattering,\u201d Gibbons said.\n\nPhiladelphia took the lead with a three-run fifth. Ryan Howard led off with an infield single that bounced off his leg. Gibbons asked for a review but was denied.\n\n\u201cI figured one of the umpires must have saw that,\u201d Gibbons said. \u201cThought it was pretty obvious.\u201d\n\nDarin Ruf, Asche and Andres Blanco followed with consecutive doubles.\n\nMartin doubled off the glove of center fielder Ben Revere to begin the fourth, but Morgan responded by setting down the next nine batters.\n\nNUMBERS GAME\n\nBlue Jays third base coach Luis Rivera changed his jersey number from 2 to 4 so that Tulowitzki could wear his preferred number. Tulowitzki was assigned the locker that once belonged to Reyes.\n\nHOMER HAPPY\n\nToronto has gone deep in 10 straight games, matching their longest streak of the season. They also did it from May 21 to May 31.\n\nSOLID DEBUT FOR HAWKINS\n\nVeteran RHP LaTroy Hawkins, acquired from Colorado along with Tulowitzki, made his debut with a perfect, eight-pitch sixth.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nPhillies: Phillies LHP Cole Hamels is being pushed back one day and is not scheduled to start for again until after Friday\u2019s trade deadline has passed. Hamels threw a season-high 129 pitches in Sunday\u2019s no-hitter over the Cubs at Wrigley Field. He is 6-7 with a 3.64 ERA in 20 starts.\n\nBlue Jays: Travis left after two innings with a sore left shoulder. Travis missed 36 games earlier this season because of a shoulder injury, suffered when he was hit by a bad hop grounder in an April 30 game at Cleveland.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nPhillies: RHP Jerome Williams (3-7, 6.28 ERA) pitched six innings against the Chicago Cubs on July 24, his first start after missing more than a month with a strained left hamstring. He\u2019s 2-0 in four career appearances against Toronto.\n\nBlue Jays: RHP R.A. Dickey (4-10, 4.53 ERA) pitched 8 1-3 innings to beat Oakland on July 23, snapping a five-start winless streak. Dickey has allowed three earned runs or fewer in nine of his past 10 outings.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Blue Jays lost another close game and watched two players leave with injuries Tuesday night.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The Blue Jays lost another close game and watched two players leave with injuries Tuesday night.", "title": "Bautista, Travis hurt as Blue Jays lose to Phillies 3-2", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jul/28/bautista-travis-hurt-as-blue-jays-lose-to-phillies/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/07/28/1afa8dbbcc2689217d0f6a7067002e1f.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/07/28/1afa8dbbcc2689217d0f6a7067002e1f.jpg", "description": "The Blue Jays lost another close game and watched two players leave with injuries Tuesday night.", "card": "summary", "title": "Bautista, Travis hurt as Blue Jays lose to Phillies 3-2"}, "Author": "IAN HARRISON", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "Blue Jays: Travis left after two innings with a sore left shoulder.\nTORONTO (AP) - The Blue Jays lost another close game and watched two players leave with injuries Tuesday night.\nSecond baseman Devon Travis left with a sore shoulder and slugger Jose Bautista hobbled off with cramps in his right hamstring as Toronto lost 3-2 to the Philadelphia Phillies.\nAll-Star shortstop Troy Tulowitzki, acquired by Toronto from Colorado, was not active and is expected to make his Blue Jays debut on Wednesday.\nBlue Jays: RHP R.A.
