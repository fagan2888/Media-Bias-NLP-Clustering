Others may put the highest priority on rebounding totals.\n\nAnd players, of course, look for the number of points they scored.\n\nWhen Colorado men\u2019s coach Tad Boyle spots a stat sheet, a bit of arithmetic is required. He\u2019s an absolute fanatic about assist-to-turnover ratio.\n\nThat\u2019s the number of assists divided by the number of turnovers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the first thing I look for,\u201d Boyle said. \u201cI look at assists and turnovers. I want every player, whether it\u2019s a post player or a perimeter player, to take pride in his assist-to-turnover ratio.\u201d\n\nBoyle said he continues to be frustrated by the inability of his team to improve on its assist-to-turnover ratio.\n\nColorado (8-5, 1-0 Pac-12) opened league play Friday night at the Coors Events Center with a 62-56 victory over UCLA. Boyle praised his team for its intensity and tenacity. But he was disappointed in the negative assist-to-turnover ratio compiled by the Buffaloes: 12 assists against 18 turnovers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a function of being able to make plays for others,\u201d Boyle said of assist-to-turnover ratio. \u201cAnd it\u2019s taking care of the basketball. You have to do those two things.\u201d\n\nIn the most recent Pac-12 statistics, Colorado ranked at the bottom (0.9) among conference teams in assist-to-turnover ratio. CU and Southern California (also 0.9) were the only Pac-12 teams with a negative assist-to-turnover ratio. A ratio of 1.1 or higher stands in positive territory.\n\nBoyle does not expect his entire starting lineup to rank among the league leaders in assist-to-turnover ratio. But he has set standards.\n\nFor post players (centers and forwards), Boyle wants to see a 1-to-1 ratio. Perimeter players (wing forwards and shooting guards) should be 2-to-1, with twice as many assists as turnovers. Point guards, Boyle said, should strive for a 3-to-1 assist-to-turnover ratio.\n\n\u201cIf you do that, it means you\u2019re playing at an elite level,\u201d Boyle said. \u201cBut if it\u2019s negative, you\u2019re hurting the team.\n\n\u201cIt really comes down to a player making good decisions on the court,\u201d he explained. \u201cThat\u2019s something everybody can improve on.\u201d\n\nOf the Buffaloes\u2019 top nine players, only four have a positive assist-to-turnover ratio: junior forward-center Josh Scott (2.1), senior combination guard Askia Booker (1.3), freshman point guard Dominique Collier (1.3) and junior combination guard Xavier Talton (1.1).\n\n\u201cCoach (Boyle) wants us to play hard but also smart,\u201d Booker said.\n\nOnly Scott\u2019s ratio reaches the standards set by Boyle relative to a player\u2019s position.\n\n\u201cJosh Scott has 15 assists in 12 games (he missed the victory over UCLA because of back spasms), and that\u2019s certainly not earth shattering,\u201d Boyle said. \u201cBut he has only seven turnovers. It\u2019s the ratio that\u2019s important.\u201d\n\nRelative to assist-to-turnover ratio, several key Colorado players have a long way to go before pleasing Boyle. Junior forward Xavier Johnson has 24 turnovers and just eight assists (0.3). Sophomore forward Dustin Thomas has 19 turnovers and 10 assists (0.5). Sophomore guard Jaron Hopkins has 19 assists but also 23 turnovers (0.8).\n\nColorado\u2019s poor assist-to-turnover ratio no doubt has contributed to the Buffs\u2019 disappointing record thus far. Committing a turnover or failing to pass to an open shooter especially rears its ugly head during crunchtime. CU has lost three games \u2014 to Colorado State, George Washington and Hawaii \u2014 by three points or fewer.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s funny, we\u2019ve worked more in practice this year on passing than we ever have,\u201d Boyle said. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t helped. But as a coach, you watch film with players and try ball-handling and passing drills.\n\n\u201cWhat I have found is, there are certain players that seem to have a knack for a good (assist-to-turnover) ratio. It\u2019s a feel thing. Especially when players become juniors and seniors, they should have a feel for how to get that done.\u201d\n\nColorado has another opportunity to earn a Pac-12 victory and, yes, improve on its assist-to-turnover ratio at noon Sunday against visiting Southern California (8-5, 0-1).\n\nTom Kensler: tkensler@denverpost.com or twitter.com/tomkensler\n\nA passing grade?\n\nCU\u2019s assist-to-turnover ratio under coach Tad Boyle:\n\n*2014-15: 0.87 (12th in the Pac-12)\n\n2013-14: 0.85 (12th in the Pac-12)\n\n2012-13: 0.74 (12th in the Pac-12)\n\n2011-12: 0.90 (ninth in the Pac-12)\n\n2010-11: 1.18 (fourth in the Big 12)\n\n* Through 13 games\n\nSources: Pac-12, Big 12", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "To Colorado coach Tad Boyle, it\u2019s about assist-to-turnover ratio", "title": "To Colorado coach Tad Boyle, it\u2019s about assist-to-turnover ratio", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/01/03/to-colorado-coach-tad-boyle-its-about-assist-to-turnover-ratio/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150103__cu-tad-boylep1.jpg", "height": 458}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150103__cu-tad-boylep1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-01-03T13:06:29+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T03:30:03+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "University of Colorado"}, "article_summary": "It\u2019s the ratio that\u2019s important.\u201dRelative to assist-to-turnover ratio, several key Colorado players have a long way to go before pleasing Boyle.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a function of being able to make plays for others,\u201d Boyle said of assist-to-turnover ratio.\n\u201cWhat I have found is, there are certain players that seem to have a knack for a good (assist-to-turnover) ratio.\nBoyle does not expect his entire starting lineup to rank among the league leaders in assist-to-turnover ratio.\nColorado\u2019s poor assist-to-turnover ratio no doubt has contributed to the Buffs\u2019 disappointing record thus far."}
