We must warn the court against another exercise of \u201craw judicial power\u201d like that handed down with its infamous 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling. That cruel and unjust ruling is viewed as illegitimate by tens of millions of Americans. Young people especially are turning against abortion-on-demand. We see this in every pro-life march. And this public outcry is being translated into a bumper crop of pro-life legislation bubbling up in state legislatures.\n\nThe lethal Roe v. Wade ruling did serious harm to the Supreme Court\u2019s reputation. Now, the Court may once again overstep its authority. The justices are being asked not merely to redefine marriage, but to end it. That is because once marriage is no longer recognized as the union of one man and one woman, there is no legal or logical stopping point.\n\nThe radical theorists who signed on to www.beyondmarriage.org know this. That\u2019s why they want to rip marriage from its traditional place in society and replace it with a fluid and ever-changing set of relationships. These radicals say in their \u201cBeyond Marriage\u201d manifesto that any number of consenting adults should have legal custody of any number of children.\n\nI believe the Court may be headed for more than a Roe II ruling. It is also headed for another Dred Scott opinion. That 1857 ruling of the Supreme Court said it was legal to take slaves from slave states into free territories and the slaves would remain slaves.\n\nThis Supreme Court ruling caused an uproar in the country and endangered the rights of Americans in the free states. It spurred the growth of the new anti-slavery party, the Republicans. It brought Abraham Lincoln new prominence in the state of Illinois and the nation.\n\nWhen Chief Justice Roger B. Taney wrote his Dred Scott opinion, he falsified U.S. history. He tried to argue that Negroes were never a part of the political community that had ratified the Constitution. Thus, Taney maintained, black Americans were excluded from the famous words of the Constitution\u2019s Preamble: \u201cWe the People\u201d (We see echoes of Taney\u2019s flawed reasoning in President Obama\u2019s bitter complaint that he could not have entered the front door of the Constitutional Convention).\n\nNo, Lincoln said. He quoted Justice Curtis\u2019s dissent in Dred Scott. Black Americans were indeed a part of the political community that authorized the Constitution. Blacks were voters in five of the original thirteen states that voted to ratify the Constitution. Known then as free Negroes, these Americans, Lincoln maintained, \u201cin proportion to their numbers had the same part in making the Constitution that white people had.\u201d\n\nPresident Lincoln and many others knew the so-called 3/5 compromise was more than a political equation, they knew it was an affront to the \u201cLaws of Nature and Nature\u2019s God\u201d.\n\nLincoln protested against the injustice of the Dred Scott ruling, to be sure. But he also challenged the factual basis of this deeply flawed ruling.\n\nPresident Obama went to Selma, Alabama recently to commemorate the massive 1965 demonstration there led by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. That demonstration demanded voting rights for black Americans. We should remember Selma and the \u201cBloody Sunday\u201d that was necessary to achieve the too-long-denied equal voting rights for all our citizens.\n\nToday, rogue federal judges are engaged in the most massive case of voter suppression we have seen since the days of Jim Crow! Across the country, but especially in the South, black Americans joined other citizens in voting to affirm true marriage. They helped place protections for natural marriage in their state constitutions. In Alabama, an astonishing 81 percent voted for marriage. This may have been the highest vote of blacks and whites united on any political issue in the state\u2019s history.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Ken Blackwell", "description": "A Roe II would be a death blow to the integrity of the Supreme Court.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "As the U.S. Supreme Court prepares to consider whether to overturn the marriage laws of all the states \u2014 as some activist federal judges have already done in\u00a0some\u00a0of the states -- conservatives ar", "title": "A Dred Scott Decision For Unborn Children?", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2015/03/10/a-dred-scott-decision-for-unborn-children/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/2015-03-04T165122Z_1_LYNXMPEB230UA_RTROPTP_4_USA-COURT-HEALTHCARE-e1425581829790.jpg", "height": 516}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A Roe II would be a death blow to the integrity of the Supreme Court.", "title": "A Dred Scott Decision For Unborn Children?
