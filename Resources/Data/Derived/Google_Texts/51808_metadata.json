Politico reports that Trump has inspired a movement of people that now hold positions at the Republican National Committee and other jobs within the party. Many of those come with four-year terms, meaning the 2020 presidential election could have some Trump in it too, at least in some form.\"The one thing that I've seen across the country are change agents getting involved,\" Citizens United CEO and Trump supporter David Bossie told the Politico. Bossie secured a job at the RNC over the weekend.\"Whether they are 100 percent with me or not, I appreciate people who will stand up and be counted. That's really I think what Mr. Trump's done is given voice to a whole bunch of people who are going to be heard.\"Trump is the presumptive Republican presidential nominee and he is expected to take on Democrat Hillary Clinton in November's general election.Whoever takes a seat in the Oval Office next January, however, Trump's legacy will live on in the Republican Party. Also helping to push some change in the party has been Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who suspended his presidential campaign last month but who has a strong base of support among the tea party.\"The Trump and Cruz forces are natural allies and reflect a lot of the conservative orientation that you've seen historically in the party,\" former RNC member Jim Bopp told Politico. \"Every four years over the last decade, the RNC is becoming increasingly conservative.\"Trump's rise to the top of the polls has irked many Republicans in Washington, including House Speaker Paul Ryan. Trump, however, has held several meetings in recent weeks with some of the nation's most powerful Republicans as he tries to earn their support, help fix the broken party, and even spruce up his foreign policy chops.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "politico, trump, influence, republican party, presidential, election", "pubdate": "2016-05-19T18:35:12", "og": {"site_name": "Newsmax", "description": "Donald Trump's influence on the Republican Party will be felt far beyond the 2016 presidential election whether he wins the presidency or not.", "title": "Politico: Win or Lose, Trump Is Here to Stay", "url": "http://www.newsmax.com/Politics/politico-trump-influence-republican-party/2016/05/19/id/729764/", "type": "article", "image": "http://www.newsmax.com/CMSPages/GetFile.aspx?guid=fdddcee0-4f15-43de-8006-6ca6842e9f48&SiteName=Newsmax", "page_id": 85452072376}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.newsmax.com/Politics/politico-trump-influence-republican-party/2016/05/19/id/729764/", "title": "Politico: Win or Lose, Trump Is Here to Stay", "description": "Donald Trump's influence on the Republican Party will be felt far beyond the 2016 presidential election whether he wins the presidency or not.", "site": "Newsmax"}, "fb": {"admins": 100002083767056, "app_id": 323020797885219}, "msvalidate.01": "FAF1322EC761685A5DD9344A1C19E82A", "epoch": 1463682912, "google-site-verification": "Jt2HUKgzJJw9VwIQJv31ETytuvNNm5ypTWN6j0nYvHM", "keywords": "politico, trump, influence, republican party, presidential, election", "article": {"section": "Politics", "published_time": "2016-05-19T18:35:12"}, "original-source": "http://www.newsmax.com/Politics/politico-trump-influence-republican-party/2016/05/19/id/729764/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "description": "Donald Trump's influence on the Republican Party will be felt far beyond the 2016 presidential election whether he wins the presidency or not."}, "article_summary": "Donald Trump's influence on the Republican Party will be felt far beyond the 2016 presidential election whether he wins the presidency or not.\nPolitico reports that Trump has inspired a movement of people that now hold positions at the Republican National Committee and other jobs within the party.\n\"The one thing that I've seen across the country are change agents getting involved,\" Citizens United CEO and Trump supporter David Bossie told the Politico.\nMany of those come with four-year terms, meaning the 2020 presidential election could have some Trump in it too, at least in some form.\n\"The Trump and Cruz forces are natural allies and reflect a lot of the conservative orientation that you've seen historically in the party,\" former RNC member Jim Bopp told Politico."}
