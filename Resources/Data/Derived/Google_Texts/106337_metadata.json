However, a panel of experts believes that less government intrusion combined with millennials\u2019 entrepreneurial spirit could create a stronger America.\n\nThe panel, hosted Monday by The Heritage Foundation, included Diana Furchtgott-Roth and Jared Meyer, co-authors of \u201cDisinherited: How Washington is Betraying America\u2019s Young\u201c, along with Heritage education policy expert Lindsey Burke and Patrice Lee, manager of outreach for Generation Opportunity, a leadership development group for millennials.\n\nThe discussion centered on how they believe policies of the past have impeded chances for a positive future.\n\nBurke pointed to the $12,000 per student per year spent on an education system that she said doesn\u2019t fit the needs of too many of its students.\n\nShe spoke of educational savings accounts, which give parents 90 percent of what the state would have spent on a child to spend on private schools or other educational products and services that they think best serve their children\u2019s needs.\n\n\u201cWe can get a better quality product and actually bring down prices,\u201d Burke said. \u201cIt all comes back, in my opinion, to funding the child and not the physical school building.\u201d\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just the educational system that holds back millennials, panelists said. Government regulation hits young entrepreneurs particularly hard, they argue.\n\nCurrently, more than one in three workers need permission from the government in a form of a license or permit to do their job. In some cases, public safety is an issue. But it takes an average of almost six years to be a licensed interior designer, a job unrelated to public health.\n\n\u201cA lot of young people should be \u2026 seeing a need and learning to fill that need in the market,\u201d said Meyer, a fellow at the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research.\n\n\u201cWe need to question these things that are taking opportunity away from young people.\u201d\n\nMillennials do have important ideas, like the shared economy approach demonstrated through successful entrepreneurship ventures such as Uber and Airbnb. Lee said 87 percent of young adults see innovation and entrepreneurship as critical to maintaining America\u2019s strength.\n\n\u201cAs the most innovative generation, we\u2019re using technology to create our own opportunities,\u201d Lee said.\n\nThis generation also will have to be creative about its approach to paying for government, panelists said.\n\n\u201cThe [entitlement] programs, as they are now, are unsustainable. They\u2019re not going to be there when you retire,\u201d Furchtgott-Roth said.\n\nAccording to Furchtgott-Roth, a Manhattan Institute senior fellow and former chief economist of the U.S. Department of Labor, the answer is simple.\n\n\u201cWe need strong leaders, strong politicians, who have the courage of their principles, and who actually make the changes,\u201d Furchtgott-Roth said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A panel at The Heritage Foundation discussed how public policy can help millennials achieve a positive future.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A panel at The Heritage Foundation discussed how public policy can help millennials achieve a positive future.", "title": "Can Millennials Achieve the American Dream?", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/millennial.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-06-09T18:13:33+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1HmI3CK"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A panel at The Heritage Foundation discussed how public policy can help millennials achieve a positive future.", "title": "Can Millennials Achieve the American Dream?", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/millennial.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "individual freedom", "published_time": "2015-06-09T16:06:49+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-09T18:13:33+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Millennials, Social Security, School Choice, Entrepreneurship, Diana Furchtgott-Roth, Jared Meyer, Lindsey Burke, Patrice Lee, Manhattan Institute, Generation Next"}, "article_summary": "Are millennials in line for their share of the American Dream?\n\u201cWe need strong leaders, strong politicians, who have the courage of their principles, and who actually make the changes,\u201d Furchtgott-Roth said.\nHowever, a panel of experts believes that less government intrusion combined with millennials\u2019 entrepreneurial spirit could create a stronger America.\n\u201cIt all comes back, in my opinion, to funding the child and not the physical school building.\u201dAnd it\u2019s not just the educational system that holds back millennials, panelists said.\nSome have deemed millennials the \u201clost generation\u201d of the Great Recession."}
