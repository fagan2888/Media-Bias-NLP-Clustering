But the AD hiring was put off until a decision on whether to proceed with the on-campus stadium project was made, so presumably that search now will move forward too.\n\nCSU is working with DHR\u2019s Glenn Sugiyama and Pat Richter.\n\nSugiyama works out of DHP\u2019s Chicago office.\n\nRichter, based in the firm\u2019s Lansing, Mich., office, was a two-time All-America end at Wisconsin and played nine seasons in the NFL with the Washington Redskins. After his retirement from football, he was an attorney in a Madison law firm and then an executive at Oscar Mayer before serving as Wisconsin\u2019s athletic director from 1989-2004. This picture of us was taken at a book launch party for Third Down and a War to Go in Madison in 2004.
