The story tells of Scrooge\u2019s transformation from a greedy misanthrope who reviles Christmas and dismisses it as so much \u201chumbug\u201d to a benevolent, charitable man. Playwright Doris Baizley\u2019s dramatic adaptation departs from the traditional story with a tale about a traveling company whose key cast members leave its production of A Christmas Carol, forcing crew members to fill in the missing roles. Santa Fe Playhouse\u2019s production is based on Baizley\u2019s script, a lighthearted romp that retains the key elements of the traditional story while adding a play-within-a-play twist.\n\nThis production, directed by actor and radio personality Dan Gerrity, almost didn\u2019t happen. The death of Gerrity on Nov. 20, just a few weeks into rehearsals, left the cast and crew, as well as the community, shaken. Those involved in the production had a dilemma: move ahead with the play or cancel it. \u201cWe met that night, and obviously that was the first question on our minds,\u201d said Carla Garcia, the show\u2019s stage manager, who joined musical director Campbell Martin at the playhouse for an interview with Pasatiempo. \u201cWhen I first called everybody, they were so stunned. Campbell even said he was not ready to move forward, but once we actually got together in the evening, we really felt we needed to move on. He would have wanted us to. So we did.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "The Santa Fe New Mexican", "description": "Santa Fe Playhouse\u2019s production of \"A Christmas Carol\" is based on Doris Baizley\u2019s script, a lighthearted romp that retains the key elements of the traditional story while adding a play-within-a-play twist.", "title": "Working out the humbugs: A light take on \u201cA Christmas Carol\u201d", "url": "http://www.santafenewmexican.com/pasatiempo/performance/theater/working-out-the-humbugs-a-light-take-on-a-christmas/article_cb4f2ec0-55ec-510f-aabd-0116a125a056.html", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/santafenewmexican.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/6/d5/6d5300d8-5df1-11e3-b478-0019bb30f31a/52a0ebf6cd537.preview-600.jpg?resize=600%2C400", "height": 400}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@thenewmexican", "card": "summary"}, "description": "Santa Fe Playhouse\u2019s production of \"A Christmas Carol\" is based on Doris Baizley\u2019s script, a lighthearted romp that retains the key elements of the traditional story while adding a play-within-a-play twist.", "fb": {"app_id": 1519422651719737}, "keywords": "michael abatemarco,a christmas carol,charles dickens,ebenezer scrooge,santa fe playhouse,doris baizley,dan gerrity,campbell martin,carla garcia,ksfr-fm,tom mason,jerry ferraccio,deborah dennard,emma scherer,karen leigh,quinn mander,theater", "news_keywords": "michael abatemarco,a christmas carol,charles dickens,ebenezer scrooge,santa fe playhouse,doris baizley,dan gerrity,campbell martin,carla garcia,ksfr-fm,tom mason,jerry ferraccio,deborah dennard,emma scherer,karen leigh,quinn mander,theater"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc700\"", "article_summary": "Playwright Doris Baizley\u2019s dramatic adaptation departs from the traditional story with a tale about a traveling company whose key cast members leave its production of A Christmas Carol, forcing crew members to fill in the missing roles.\nThe story tells of Scrooge\u2019s transformation from a greedy misanthrope who reviles Christmas and dismisses it as so much \u201chumbug\u201d to a benevolent, charitable man.\nThe death of Gerrity on Nov. 20, just a few weeks into rehearsals, left the cast and crew, as well as the community, shaken.\nSanta Fe Playhouse\u2019s production is based on Baizley\u2019s script, a lighthearted romp that retains the key elements of the traditional story while adding a play-within-a-play twist.\nThose involved in the production had a dilemma: move ahead with the play or cancel it."}
