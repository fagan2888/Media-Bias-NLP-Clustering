A piratic flycatcher.

A small bird that's typically found hundreds of miles away in Mexico and South America apparently made its way to western Kansas, watchers say, giving the Sunflower State a couple of possible birding firsts.

The piratic flycatcher, a migratory bird that nests as far away as Argentina, has been seen as far north as New Mexico, Texas and Florida. But it hasn't been reported in Kansas until earlier this month.

Mike Rader, with the Kansas Department of Wildlife, Parks and Tourism, says if the May 8 sighting at Scott State Park is confirmed by the Kansas Bird Records Committee, it would be the most northerly sighting of the bird.

Mark Robbins, records committee chairman, says the documentation with this sighting is so detailed, it's recognition is a "no-brainer."
