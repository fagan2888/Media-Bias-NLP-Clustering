She and Freeman then went back to the network with the idea of a series about what it\u2019s like to be the female Secretary of State \u201cand how it translates overseas when rights for women are not what they are here.\u201d\n\n\u201cMadam Secretary\u201d will star T\u00e9a Leoni as Elizabeth McCord, \u201cthe shrewd, determined, newly appointed Secretary of State who drives international diplomacy, battles office politics and circumvents protocol as she negotiates global and domestic issues, both at the White House and at home,\u201d according to a CBS news release.\n\nThe show is set about five years in the future. McCreary did not mention whether or not the actual Benghazi attacks would be included in the series or if Hillary would have any sort of role in the show\u2019s direction. Former secretary of state Madeleine Albright, however, will be involved with the production, according toDeadline.\n\nT\u00e9a Leoni doesn\u2019t bear too much of a likeness to Hillary, except in one area \u2014 their shared affinity for the pantsuit. The show\u2019s trailer does indicate that her wardrobe and lack of style might come up over the course of the series.\n\nWatch the full trailer below:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "Executive Producer Lori McCreary, from left, Executive Producer Morgan Freeman, Tea Leoni, Tim Daly and Executive Producer/Creator Barbara Hall participate during the \u201cMadam Secretary\u201d panel at the CBS 2014 Summer TCA at the Beverly Hilton Hotel on Thursday, July 17, 2014, in Beverly Hills...", "title": "New CBS Show 'Madam Secretary' inspired by Hillary Clinton and...", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://redalertpolitics.com/files/2014/07/Screen-Shot-2014-07-19-at-2.22.41-PM-600x315.png", "height": 315}, "url": "http://redalertpolitics.com/2014/07/19/new-cbs-show-madam-secretary-inspired-hillary-clinton-benghazi/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 1285945407, "app_id": 529886110401651}, "msvalidate.01": "0F003B4674EABE0F24651B476B61A43C", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/RedAlertPolitics", "tag": "television-series", "published_time": "2014-07-19T14:25:11+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-19T14:25:11+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd839d\"", "article_summary": "A new CBS television series was inspired by Hillary Clinton and Benghazi, the show\u2019s producer announced this week at the Television Critics Association summer tour.\nThe show\u2019s trailer does indicate that her wardrobe and lack of style might come up over the course of the series.\nFormer secretary of state Madeleine Albright, however, will be involved with the production, according toDeadline.\n\u201cAnd then, guess what happened \u2014 the Benghazi hearings,\u201d McCreary said.\nT\u00e9a Leoni doesn\u2019t bear too much of a likeness to Hillary, except in one area \u2014 their shared affinity for the pantsuit."}
