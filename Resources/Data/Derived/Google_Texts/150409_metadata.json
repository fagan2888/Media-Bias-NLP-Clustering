The HBO host noted the state\u2019s ranking in largest global economies \u2014 8th \u2014 and touted that once the Golden State makes a charge, the rest of the country follows suit, referencing the state\u2019s ability to pass gun control legislation before Congress.\n\n\u201cYou know it\u2019s so ironic. The two things conservatives love the most, the free market and states rights, are the two things that are going to bend this country into California\u2019s image as a socialist fag-topia,\u201d Maher said. \u201cMaybe our constipated Congress in Washington can\u2019t pass gun control laws, but we just did. Because we don\u2019t give a s**t about the NRA. Out here that stands for nuts, racists and a**holes.\u201d\n\nBut Maher didn\u2019t stop there. He continued, taking a shot at Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), who launched a 21-hour \u201cfilibuster\u201d earlier this week to protest the Affordable Care Act. Cruz\u2019s speech won him admiration from the voters, but Maher saw it differently, comparing the Tea Party darling to Miley Cyrus and saying a filibuster is the \u201cpolitical version of twerking.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was thinking the other night, he reminds me of Miley Cyrus, Ted Cruz. Because he is not afraid to incur the wrath of even some of his fans for the greater good of drawing attention to himself,\u201d Maher said.\n\nCyrus gained notoriety for her performance at the \u201cMTV Video Music Awards\u201d last month for her \u201ctwerking\u201d and suggestive dance moves.\n\n\u201cI really think that a filibuster is the political version of twerking. And for those people who say, \u2018Ted Cruz, he hung himself.\u2019 No. Just like Miley Cyrus, she came out the winner in that. Everybody said, \u2018oh, she\u2019s ruined her career.\u2019 She\u2019s on the cover of Rolling Stone, her records are outselling anybody else\u2019s. I think Ted Cruz is going to be the winner too,\u201d Maher said.\n\nCheck out Maher\u2019s segments below.
