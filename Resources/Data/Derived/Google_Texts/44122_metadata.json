On Friday, a White House official said that the glitches would be smoothed out by the end of November.\n\nBut that timetable isn\u2019t good enough for the \u201cMalcolm in the Middle\u201d star.\n\n\u201cThis Obamacare launch is an embarrassment to the American people,\u201d Muniz tweeted. \u201cHow many more promises have to be broken?\u201d\n\nAlso read: Jon Stewart on Evil Obamacare: Poor People Can Always Go to the ER!\n\nMuniz, who briefly tried a racing career and later became a drummer for the band Kingsfoil, has been largely absent from the big or small screens since \u201cMalcolm in the Middle\u201d wrapped up its seven season run in 2006. He did have a starring role in 2011\u2019s \u201cPizza Man\u201d and logged guest appearances on \u201cLast Man Standing and \u201cDon\u2019t Trust the B\u2014- in Apartment 23.\u201d\n\nFor the most part, his Twitter feed has been devoted to tales from the road with his band and details of his fast food excursions, but he has made a few brief forays into politics. In June, for instance, he criticized a key foreign policy adviser appointment.\n\n\u201cReally? Susan Rice? National Security Adviser? Really? Another # ObamaFail. Wake up people,\u201d Muniz tweeted.\n\nRice has been loudly criticized in conservative circles for her handling of questions related to the 2012 Benghazi attack that left four people dead, including U.S. Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens.\n\nNo word yet on how Muniz views the president\u2019s handling of the crisis in Syria or the debt ceiling debate, but we\u2019ll remain glued to Twitter.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Screen-shot-2013-10-26-at-10.48.59-AM-150x150.png", "sailthru.author": "Brent Lang", "description": "\"Malcolm in the Middle\" star is no fan of the president", "generator": "WooFramework 6.2.0", "og": {"site_name": "TheWrap", "description": "\"Malcolm in the Middle\" star is no fan of the president", "title": "Frankie Muniz Slams Obamacare as 'Embarrassment' on Twitter", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 614, "identifier": "http://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Screen-shot-2013-10-26-at-10.48.59-AM.png", "height": 412}, "updated_time": "2014-07-10T20:31:29+00:00", "url": "http://www.thewrap.com/frankie-muniz-slams-obamacare-embarrassment-twitter/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "&#8220;Malcolm in the Middle&#8221; star is no fan of the president", "creator": "@brentalang", "url": "http://www.thewrap.com/frankie-muniz-slams-obamacare-embarrassment-twitter/", "image": {"src": "http://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Screen-shot-2013-10-26-at-10.48.59-AM-340x300.png", "identifier": "http://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Screen-shot-2013-10-26-at-10.48.59-AM-340x300.png"}, "title": "Frankie Muniz Slams Obamacare as \u2018Embarrassment\u2019 on Twitter", "site": "@thewrap", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2013-10-26T15:21:00+00:00", "sailthru.title": "Frankie Muniz Slams Obamacare as \u2018Embarrassment\u2019 on Twitter", "wp-parsely_version": "1.6", "fb": {"app_id": 228236404181023}, "google-site-verification": "-PpFSIrGHybVDxbndrL6MCngw3j6BXdy0xDVBVVOacI", "sailthru.tags": "frankie muniz", "article": {"publisher": "http://facebook.com/thewrap", "section": "TV", "tag": "Frankie Muniz", "published_time": "2013-10-26T08:21:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-10T20:31:29+00:00"}, "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"Frankie Muniz Slams Obamacare as \u2018Embarrassment\u2019 on Twitter\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/www.thewrap.com\\/frankie-muniz-slams-obamacare-embarrassment-twitter\\/\",\"image_url\":\"http:\\/\\/www.thewrap.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2013\\/10\\/Screen-shot-2013-10-26-at-10.48.59-AM-150x150.png\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":\"173123\",\"pub_date\":\"2013-10-26T15:21:00Z\",\"section\":\"TV\",\"author\":\"Brent Lang\",\"tags\":[\"frankie muniz\"]}", "sailthru.category": "tv", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Screen-shot-2013-10-26-at-10.48.59-AM.png", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=6.0, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda73c\"", "article_summary": "\u201cMalcolm in the Middle\u201d star is no fan of the presidentAdd Frankie Muniz to the chorus of critics of Obamacare.\n\u201cThis Obamacare launch is an embarrassment to the American people,\u201d Muniz tweeted.\nNo word yet on how Muniz views the president\u2019s handling of the crisis in Syria or the debt ceiling debate, but we\u2019ll remain glued to Twitter.\n\u201cHow many more promises have to be broken?\u201dAlso read: Jon Stewart on Evil Obamacare: Poor People Can Always Go to the ER!\nOn Friday, a White House official said that the glitches would be smoothed out by the end of November."}
