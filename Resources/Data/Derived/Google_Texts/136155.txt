It seems like the new Common Core educational standards suddenly appeared out of nowhere, doesn’t it? All of a sudden, every kid was getting a Common Core education. The whole thing just materialized before we got a chance to think about it!

It seems that way, right? Well, that’s because it is that way. By design.

Through a combination of lavish spending by Microsoft’s Bill Gates and swift movement by the Obama administration, the Common Core standards that have now become so controversial were instituted pretty much before anyone knew what was happening. And of course – this is the Obama administration we’re talking about – without the cumbersome, annoying intrusion of democratic processes.

That’s the point of a superb article published recently in the Washington Post. Here’s what happened, according to the Post:

The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation didn’t just bankroll the development of what became known as the Common Core State Standards. With more than $200 million, the foundation also built political support across the country, persuading state governments to make systemic and costly changes . . . Money flowed to policy groups on the right and left, funding research by scholars of varying political persuasions who promoted the idea of common standards . . .

President Obama seized the opportunity to push something through without congressional input. Gates’ influence permeated the administration.
