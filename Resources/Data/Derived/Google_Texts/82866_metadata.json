It is fair to say that when people think back on the past six years, they will likely remember that Republicans were responsible for damaging the world\u2019s financial system and America\u2019s economy twice, and are right on schedule to do it again. Americans should be used to regularly-scheduled financial crises due to Republicans playing hostage politics, and quite likely they have learned to accept it as the consequence of electing fascists to serve in Congress.\n\nThe current debt ceiling crisis marks the third time in six years Republicans were instrumental in creating havoc with the world, and America\u2019s, economy through economic malfeasance and manufactured financial emergencies. Now that they are creating another crisis, they are maneuvering to plan the next emergency to take another shot at thwarting the Affordable Care Act before the end of the 2013 calendar year.\n\nEach of the GOP\u2019s economic disasters has cost the nation dearly including the 2007-08 crash that killed tens-of-millions of jobs and decimated the world\u2019s economy, and in 2011 they cost America a million jobs, nearly $19 billion in interest fees, and a sequester slated to kill over a million jobs within the next year. There is no telling what the current crisis will cost the nation or how devastating the next planned crisis will be will be to the economy, but if Republicans prevail there is little doubt the cost will be painful because the GOP is highly motivated to keep the economy in dire straits. While Americans may be getting accustomed to Republican-created financial crises, world leaders remember the level of damage they are capable of and lashed out at Congress for shutting down the government and playing politics with the debt ceiling.\n\nWhile neo-confederates Rafael Cruz and Sarah Palin were minimizing the Republican shutdown in Washington D.C. over the weekend, world economic leaders were pleading, warning, and pressing America to \u201craise its debt ceiling and reopen its government or risk massive disruption the world over\u201d according to Christine Lagarde, the International Monetary Fund\u2019s (IMF) managing director. The World Bank, IMF, and world leaders were in Washington to talk about the international economic recovery until \u201cthey found out that the debt ceiling was the issue\u201d and that Republicans shut down the government and made sure \u201cthere was no remedy in sight.\u201d As if Treasury Secretary and Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke were unaware of the threat to the world\u2019s economy, the leaders lectured them and predicted that even a near-default would lead to higher borrowing costs and a slowdown of the global economy; just what Republicans want.\n\nThe chairman of the French bank, BNP Paribas, said \u201cThis cannot happen, and this shall not happen. The consequences of this would be absolutely disastrous,\u201d but he was preaching to the choir and likely unaware that Republicans could not care less about the consequences of their actions. Secretary Lew readily acknowledged that \u201cOur work begins at home, and we recognize that the United States is the anchor of the international financial system, and the United States cannot take this hard-earned reputation for granted.\u201d Based on the parade of economic experts decrying America\u2019s flirtation with an economic catastrophe, the nation\u2019s reputation as an economic leader is rapidly vanishing and likely damaged irreparably.\n\nMany of the world\u2019s high-ranking economic officials made open appeals to Congress replete with warnings from America\u2019s allies and creditors alike. World Bank leader Jim Yong Kim said the \u201cworld is days away from a very dangerous moment\u201d and that \u201cthe closer we get to the deadline the greater the impact will be for the world.\u201d The German finance minister issued a stern directive to Congress that \u201cthe fiscal standoff has to be resolved without delay,\u201d and IMF\u2019s Lagarde said \u201cthat the lack of certainty, that lack of trust in the U.S. signature\u201d will disrupt the world economy.\u201d Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase painted a bleak picture of the days ahead if there is no resolution and warned that \u201cAs you get closer to it, the panic will set in and something will happen\u201d and that \u201cJPMorgan has spent huge amounts of time and money and effort to be prepared\u201d because they remember the damage Republicans wreaked in 2008 and 2011 and understand their willingness to repeat their past performances.\n\nIt is a sad day indeed when the Secretary of the Treasury and Federal Reserve chairman of the world\u2019s financial leader have to be chastised and dressed-down by foreign leaders because a group of fascist Republicans threaten the world\u2019s economy and financial system. However, it is becoming a regular occurrence for leaders of foreign nations to question the legitimacy of America as a global leader as evidenced by criticism that \u201cnobody knows if the country will still be solvent in three weeks. What is clear, though, is that America is already politically bankrupt,\u201d or that \u201ca rump in Congress is holding the whole place to ransom that doesn\u2019t really jibe with the notion of the United States as a global leader.\u201d The insults prompted Secretary of State John Kerry to tell world leaders that \u201cWhen we get this moment of political silliness behind us, we will get back on a track the world will respect and want to be part of.\u201d\n\nAfter three different financial crises in six short years, it is highly unlikely that any nation will ever respect America again and they certainly will think twice about being any part of this country\u2019s \u201ctrack;\u201d at least as long as Republicans remain a toxic political movement. The world\u2019s problem now is that toxic Republicans are as unfazed at the prospect of creating a worldwide financial catastrophe as they are destroying America\u2019s economy, and they appear legitimately pleased at the ruin their hostage politics are already wreaking on American citizens and financial markets around the world.\n\nAmerica had gone from being a respected nation under the last Democratic president to a hated warmonger and world economy destroyer under the Bush administration, and just when another Democrat saved this nation\u2019s economy and brought stability to the world\u2019s financial markets, Republicans deliberately caused a financial crisis within 8 months of taking control of the House of Representatives in 2011. Within a year-and-a-half they threatened to send the economy over the fiscal cliff in December 2012, and ten months later are two days away from sending the world\u2019s economy back into the recession they created in 2007-2008.\n\nThe state of this nation under assault by Republican fascists is beyond embarrassing; it is distressing to say the very least. For their part, Republicans are undaunted at the level of damage they have wreaked on the nation thus far, and are seemingly delighted to create an economic catastrophe that will affect the entire world. It is a sad commentary indeed that a country that was once a respected and exceptional world leader has fallen so far from the world\u2019s graces due to one political party that still cannot accept the result of two presidential elections, and their willingness to decimate the world\u2019s economy and commit political suicide to punish the people for electing an African American man as President puts them in the same league as any extremist terrorist.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Tea party Republicans who are willing to  commit political suicide to punish the people for electing an African American man as President are in the same league as any extremist terrorist.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Rmuse", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "Tea party Republicans who are willing to  commit political suicide to punish the people for electing an African American man as President are in the same league as any extremist terrorist.", "title": "Tea Party Terrorist Republicans Are on an Economic Suicide Mission to Harm Obama", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2013/10/15/tea-party-terrorist-republicans-economic-suicide-mission-harm-obama.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/tea-party-terrorism.jpg", "updated_time": "2013-10-15T16:08:30+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "Featured News,Ben Bernanke,Congress,credit default,debt ceiling crisis,economic terrorism,House of Representatives,International Monetary Fund,JPMorgan Chase,Republican Party,Republican shutdown,Shutdown,Treasury Secretary,World Bank,world recession,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,barack obama,hillary clinton,bernie sanders,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "Featured News", "published_time": "2013-10-15T16:08:30+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-10-15T16:08:30+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Ben Bernanke, Congress, credit default, debt ceiling crisis, economic terrorism, House of Representatives, International Monetary Fund, JPMorgan Chase, Republican Party, Republican shutdown, Shutdown, Treasury Secretary, World Bank, world recession"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcff88\"", "article_summary": "Many of the world\u2019s high-ranking economic officials made open appeals to Congress replete with warnings from America\u2019s allies and creditors alike.\nThe current debt ceiling crisis marks the third time in six years Republicans were instrumental in creating havoc with the world, and America\u2019s, economy through economic malfeasance and manufactured financial emergencies.\nThe state of this nation under assault by Republican fascists is beyond embarrassing; it is distressing to say the very least.\nWithin a year-and-a-half they threatened to send the economy over the fiscal cliff in December 2012, and ten months later are two days away from sending the world\u2019s economy back into the recession they created in 2007-2008.\nFor their part, Republicans are undaunted at the level of damage they have wreaked on the nation thus far, and are seemingly delighted to create an economic catastrophe that will affect the entire world."}
