(KSAT) â€” Talk about sticking together.

Australians Glen and Anthea "Cookie" Jackson-Rushford's twins were born 11 weeks early, but their drive to stick together is inspiring people around the world.

The couple gave birth to the twins, each weighing a little more than 2 pounds, on Jan. 4 at 28 weeks.

Their mother took an amazing video of the twins at a week old on their dad's chest, where they seemingly grab each other's hand. The video has been shared over 140,000 times.
