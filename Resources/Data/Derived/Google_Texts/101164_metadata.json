Beginning in 2014, parents who chose to send their children to a private school can deduct up to $4,000 paid in tuition for children in grades K through 8 and up to $10,000 for high school students. This is a tax deduction, as opposed to a tax credit, and is available to all parents, regardless of income level, which by design will benefit mostly wealthy families.\n\nThe cost to Wisconsin funding is estimated at $30 million for the 2014-2015 school year, according to Sen. Luther Olsen.\n\nTypically, tax deductions have been sold to the public as a means to spur economic activity. The original argument for vouchers \u2014 similar to the tax breaks as public money is being paid to private schools \u2014 was that they benefit only low-income families. Now, these private-school subsidies have been expanded to families regardless of income.\n\nThis tax deduction and voucher subsidies don\u2019t increase economic activity, aren\u2019t focused on helping the poor and come at a substantial cost to the funding for our state and local governments. The only thing that these subsidies accomplish is to take money from public schools and give it to private schools.\n\nNow, we\u2019re projected to have a structural deficit in state funding. This is just bad policy and not good for Wisconsin.\n\nMarcia Engen,\n\nFox Cities Advocates for Public Education,\n\nAppleton\n\nRead or Share this story: http://post.cr/1sFqcRF", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "It doesn\u2019t serve to spur economic activity, as deductions are typically meant to do", "og": {"site_name": "Post-Crescent Media", "description": "It doesn\u2019t serve to spur economic activity, as deductions are typically meant to do", "title": "Letters: Private-school tax deduction wrong", "url": "http://www.postcrescent.com/story/opinion/readers/2014/09/28/letters-private-school-tax-deduction-wrong/16263663/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/postcrescent.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "It doesn\u2019t serve to spur economic activity, as deductions are typically meant to do", "creator": "@postcrescent", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/5d7da0b6b47bc55deb4a6411645a7153d8d9e457/c=644-0-3222-2578&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Appleton/2014/09/26/school1.jpg", "title": "Letters: Private-school tax deduction wrong", "site": "@postcrescent", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=880652726", "fb": {"app_id": 117306038338949}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": ""}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd18bc\"", "article_summary": "This is a tax deduction, as opposed to a tax credit, and is available to all parents, regardless of income level, which by design will benefit mostly wealthy families.\nIt doesn\u2019t serve to spur economic activity, as deductions are typically meant to dodesks in row in classroom (Photo: Getty Images )Recently, a private-school tuition tax deduction was passed into law.\nTypically, tax deductions have been sold to the public as a means to spur economic activity.\nThis tax deduction and voucher subsidies don\u2019t increase economic activity, aren\u2019t focused on helping the poor and come at a substantial cost to the funding for our state and local governments.\nThe original argument for vouchers \u2014 similar to the tax breaks as public money is being paid to private schools \u2014 was that they benefit only low-income families."}
