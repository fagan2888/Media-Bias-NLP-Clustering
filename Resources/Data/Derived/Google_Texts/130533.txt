Navigating Obamacare: Where to get help with health insurance sign-ups

With healthcare.gov on the road to recovery and President Barack Obama pivoting from explaining computer glitches to encouraging people to sign up for subsidized health insurance, organizations that have been certified to help people navigate the rocky waters of the nation's new health insurance system are expecting a surge of interest in the next several weeks.



The Dec. 23 deadline is fast approaching to sign up for health insurance on healthcare.gov and be covered by Jan. 1.



People have until March 31 to purchase health insurance or face a $95 first-year IRS penalty, or 1 percent of taxable income. The small business mandate has been postponed for a year, as has the online function of the Small Business Health Insurance Option Program, but small businesses can still file paper applications to enroll their 50 or under workforces.



A quick place to start online is at Enroll Michigan. There is additional information at Enroll America. Small businesses and individuals can find navigators and certified application counselors to help guide them through the enrollment process.

On Monday, Oakwood Healthcare is co-sponsoring two community education forums at Oakwood Hospital & Medical Center in Dearborn. The other co-sponsors are ACCESS Community Health and Research Center, Dearborn, Enroll America and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The first session, called Understanding the Health Insurance Marketplace, is scheduled for 2-3 p.m. and the second is 6-7 p.m.



“It’s really about education, not just enrollment,” Adnan Hammad, director of ACCESS, said in a statement. “Our community at large lacks information, lacks knowledge of what the Affordable Care Act is all about.”



Computer glitches derailed and slowed enrollment on healthcare.gov, the website that Michigan residents use to search for 43 different health insurance plans, for most of October and November. But more than 125,000 people so far have signed up for health insurance on healthcare.gov with more than 150,000 on the 14 state exchanges. The federal government projected more than 7 million will sign up for private health insurance or Medicaid by March 31.



“We understand that there are a lot of questions about this process,” Mary Zatina, Oakwood’s senior vice president of government relations and corporate communications, said in a statement.



“We want to make ourselves available, like we always have, as a resource where the community can get those answers. Improving access to quality health care is what we are all about.” Oakwood has also dedicated a Web page to the Affordable Care Act: oakwood.org/affordable-care-act. The page includes a subsidy calculator consumers can use to determine how much financial assistance they can garner from the federal government.
