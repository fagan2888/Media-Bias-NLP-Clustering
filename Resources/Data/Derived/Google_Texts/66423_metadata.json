Here\u2019s why.\n\nPart of being a doctor is learning to suppress your feelings. You get good at being what people need you to be. But it slowly transforms you into something you couldn\u2019t have foreseen\u2014a sort of Stepford doctor\u2014pleasing everyone with your perfect smile and agreeable demeanor, hoping that your patient satisfaction survey will be favorable, no matter the cost.\n\nPress Ganey is one of the top providers of patient satisfaction surveys, according to the Forbes article, Why Rating Your Doctor Is Bad For Your Health.\n\nThe government has bet big on these surveys, as a recent article in Forbesnotes. Armed with the idea that \u201cpatient is always right,\u201d Washington figured that more customer satisfaction data \u201cwill improve quality of care and reduce costs.\u201d\n\nThat turns out to have been a bad bet.\n\nIn fact, the most satisfied patients are 12 percent more likely to be hospitalized and 26 percent more likely to die, according to researchers at UC Davis. \u201cOvertreatment is a silent killer,\u201d wrote Dr. William Sonnenberg in his recent Medscape article, Patient Satisfaction is Overrated. \u201cWe can over-treat and over-prescribe. The patients will be happy, give us good ratings, yet be worse off.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s Economics 101. If we ask drug-addicted patients to grade their physicians on how satisfied they are with the \u201cservice,\u201d then a high score will likely indicate they got the opposite of good medical care. It doesn\u2019t take a genius to figure out how putting addicts in charge of the patient encounter contributes to the $24 billion in excess medical costs caused by prescription opiate abuse. Nevertheless, some emergency rooms are even offering Vicodin \u201cgoody bags\u201d to improve their ratings.\n\nThanks to patient satisfaction scoring, unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions are also on the rise, adding to the deadly menace of drug-resistant bacteria. A patient demanding unnecessary antibiotics is one of the things that doctors hate most, yet nearly half of physicians surveyed said they\u2019ve had to \u201cimproperly [prescribe] antibiotics and narcotic pain medication in direct response to patient satisfaction surveys,\u201d as reported in Forbes.\n\n\u201cThe mandate is simple,\u201d wrote Dr. Sonnenberg. \u201cNever deny a request for an antibiotic, an opioid pain medication, a scan, or an admission.\u201d So instead of better care and cheaper care, satisfaction scoring is making patients sicker and driving up costs. Indeed, the UC Davis researchers found the most satisfied patients account for 9 percent more in total health-care costs\u2014and that does not include the excess monies wasted on trying to please the rest.\n\nBut when physicians don\u2019t acquiesce, they pay a price. Last year, The Atlantic profiled a physician who quit due to the pressure to prescribe narcotics. In many cases, doctors can\u2019t keep their jobs or make partner if their scores aren\u2019t\u2014not just good\u2014but stellar. And many physicians claim that hospital administrators explicitly tell them to do whatever it takes to raise scores even if it means compromising their professional standards.\n\nSo why is this happening? As one fed-up physician blogger explained in a story he entitled The Focus on Patient Satisfaction is Enough to Make you Sick, it\u2019s for \u201cthe same reason the IRS collects taxes and not seashells: Money.\u201d\n\nAnd it\u2019s big money. The companies doing the studies\u2014and their investors\u2014are getting rich. According to Forbe, Press Ganey, the biggest of the survey firms, went from a valuation of $100 million to nearly $700 million in just four years\u2014bringing in over $200 million a year. And with cash comes political influence, so of course the government plays along. Medicare uses the surveys to withhold payment to doctors and hospitals that don\u2019t have high scores.\n\nAs Forbes points out, by 2017, Obamacare\u2019s \u201cpay for performance\u201d program mandates that hospitals will lose 2 percent of their Medicare payments if they perform poorly on quality measures\u2014some 30 percent of which will be based on patient satisfaction scores. Hospitals are investing in capital upgrades like escalators to improve the \u201ccustomer\u201d experience. Meanwhile, doctors are under even more pressure to \u201cplease the customers\u201d\u2014even if it means unnecessarily scoping them, irradiating them, or plying them with toxic and addictive pills.\n\nTo be sure, physicians know that good feedback is important, but these scores aren\u2019t even good feedback. \u201cWe are not given access to [the reasons] why they were dissatisfied. We can never learn from our mistakes,\u201d one emergency department doctor was quoted in Medscape.\n\nWhile patients who read this may be unmoved by the doctors\u2019 plight, understand that not all doctors are taking this lying down. In order to protect themselves, doctors are filling patients\u2019 charts with diagnoses like \u201cdrug addiction\u201d and \u201cmental illness\u201d\u2014not exactly the kind of thing you want in your permanent medical record.\n\nThe public should be outraged that they\u2019re being used like this and flattered into believing these scores ensure good care\u2014while putting their lives in jeopardy. They should be outraged that hospitals and health systems are so corrupt that they play along instead of demanding that scores create better outcomes, not just better profits. These scores should be aligning the interests of patients and physicians\u2014because in a perfect world, physicians\u2019 and patients\u2019 interests are exactly the same.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "Health", "publicationDate": 201405210945, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/tech-and-health", "description": "Some of the country\u2019s best doctors have the worst patient satisfaction scores.
