Republicans have shown they know how to repeal the Affordable Care Act by voting on it dozens of times. But when it comes to figuring out what they'd replace it with, not so much.

Since the very day in 2010 when President Barack Obama signed the health care reform package into law, GOP leaders have promised-- over and over and over again -- to reveal a plan of their own that would make the health care system better.

Meanwhile, Obamacare has provided health insurance to about 20 million people and slashed the uninsured rate to a historic low.
