FedEx strongly urges the U.S. not to take this or any other action on a unilateral basis.\n\n\u201cLooking beyond the situation with the Gulf Carriers, an open and flagrant violation of an Open Skies agreement by the U.S. would undermine the entire U.S. policy efforts to advance aviation liberalization,\u201d the company continued. \u201cIf unhappy, existing Open Skies partners would no longer feel the need to comply with the agreements now in place. Those countries considering a new Open Skies agreement would suddenly feel the cold wind of U.S. protectionism chilling their intentions.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The company said U.S. commercial airlines' arguments are protectionist.", "description": "The company said U.S. commercial airlines' arguments are protectionist.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Keith Laing", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The company said U.S. commercial airlines' arguments are protectionist.", "title": "FedEx warns of \u2018protectionism\u2019 in foreign airline subsidy fight", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/244088-fedex-warns-of-protectionism-in-foreign-airline-subsidy-fight", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/fed_ex_plane.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T03:39-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/244088-fedex-warns-of-protectionism-in-foreign-airline-subsidy-fight", "dcterms.date": "2015-06-04T17:37-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Keith Laing", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "FedEx, Emirates Airlines, Etihad Airways, Qatar Airways, Open Skies agreements,,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-04T17:37:06-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/244088-fedex-warns-of-protectionism-in-foreign-airline-subsidy-fight", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The company said U.S. commercial airlines' arguments are protectionist.", "card": "summary", "title": "FedEx warns of \u2018protectionism\u2019 in foreign airline subsidy fight"}, "dcterms.title": "FedEx warns of \u2018protectionism\u2019 in foreign airline subsidy fight"}, "article_summary": "Those countries considering a new Open Skies agreement would suddenly feel the cold wind of U.S. protectionism chilling their intentions.\u201d\n\u201cIf unhappy, existing Open Skies partners would no longer feel the need to comply with the agreements now in place.\n\u201cA violation of the existing Open Skies agreement would invite retaliation or renunciation of their agreement by the UAE,\u201d the FedEx statement said.\n\u201cFedEx is filing in this docket primarily to defend Open Skies, not the position of the Gulf Carriers,\u201d the cargo company wrote.\nFedEx is siding with Middle Eastern airlines in a fight over foreign flight subsidies that has roiled the U.S. aviation industry."}
