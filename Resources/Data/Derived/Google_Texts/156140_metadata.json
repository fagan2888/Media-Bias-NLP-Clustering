The San Antonio Raiders? Gag.\n\nLeila, Broncos fan\n\nKiz: By winning the battle for Los Angeles, our pal Stan Kroenke left Raiders owner Mark Davis and Chargers owner Dean Spanos stuck in traffic miles from where they want to go, re-creating the scene from \u201cDumb and Dumber\u201d when Harry tells Lloyd, \u201cAccording to the map, we\u2019ve only gone 4 inches.\u201d But here\u2019s the good news: While the Raiders might end up in San Antonio, it now seems possible Spanos could go crawling back to San Diego rather than trust Kroenke to be his partner in L.A. Maybe, just maybe, the Broncos haven\u2019t played their last game in beautiful San Diego, after all. As Lloyd once said: \u201cSo you\u2019re saying there\u2019s a chance?\u201d\n\nNeighborly thing to do. I\u2019ve been a Broncos season-ticket holder since 1977. My wife and I agree to never sell our seats for more than face value, and sell only to proven Broncos fans. I\u2019ve known the people who sit with me for years. I owe it to them not to put opposing fans in their midst, and the few hundred dollars we could make are not meaningful to us.\n\nDavid, representing the 303\n\nKiz: It\u2019s tempting for any Broncos fan to sell a seat in a cold stadium for $500. But the last thing a die-hard, loyal Denver fan wants to see is some loudmouth stranger wearing a Steelers jersey sitting nearby. If you care about your neighbors in the stadium, don\u2019t be a ticket traitor.\n\nBusiness decision. Don\u2019t be a ticket traitor? Really? Don\u2019t be just like the NFL itself? Football is about the money and nothing else. Team owners are all about the money and what it takes to get more money. Loyalty is a joke. The illusion the Broncos want supporters to buy is the team plays for us, when all they really play for is the big money, as evidenced by the Rams, the Chargers and the Raiders. In the end, the fans don\u2019t matter \u2014 especially if there are fans in another city willing to pay more for the illusion of having a home team. So what if Denver ticket holders sell their tickets and the whole stadium is packed with Steelers fans? It\u2019s simply another business decision. Sell two tickets, make $1,000 and watch millionaires play the game from the comfort of your warm living room? Really? There\u2019s some question as to the logic of that? Really?\n\nRobert, Lakewood\n\nKiz: Your very intelligent points are really well taken. Let\u2019s see if I can apply the knowledge. If I give you a quarter, will you go away?\n\nTime to move CarGo. And today\u2019s parting shot asks: If the Rockies have signed outfielder Gerardo Parra to a $27.5 million contract, can a trade of Carlos Gonzalez be far off?\n\nCarGo is my fave, but he needs to go while his value is high. Although, if Parra replaces Charlie Blackmon or Corey Dickerson, then Colorado\u2019s outfield defense has been upgraded a lot.\n\nMatt, stoking the hot stove", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Thankfully, San Diego still in NFL for now", "title": "Thankfully, San Diego still in NFL for now", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/01/16/thankfully-san-diego-still-in-nfl-for-now/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160116__502113842p1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160116__502113842p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-16T18:08:20+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-18T23:56:51+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Kickin' It With Kiz"}, "article_summary": "My wife and I agree to never sell our seats for more than face value, and sell only to proven Broncos fans.\nSo what if Denver ticket holders sell their tickets and the whole stadium is packed with Steelers fans?\nIn the end, the fans don\u2019t matter \u2014 especially if there are fans in another city willing to pay more for the illusion of having a home team.\nThe San Antonio Raiders?\nDavid, representing the 303Kiz: It\u2019s tempting for any Broncos fan to sell a seat in a cold stadium for $500."}
