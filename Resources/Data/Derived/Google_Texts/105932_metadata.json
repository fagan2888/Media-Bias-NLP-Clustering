Now that I\u2019m in the thick of planning the big wedding part, I can see why people intentionally elope. We are too far along in wedding mode to turn back now, but I would definitely say from my experience I would have reconsidered five months ago.\n\nFrom my experience, here\u2019s what I have discovered about the best of both options:\n\nHere\u2019s What\u2019s Better About An Elopement:\n\nLess Opinions To Consider: When you\u2019re planning a wedding, everyone needs to put in their two cents. A few suggestions here and there are welcomed, since there is so much to cover. But it is amazing how frequently and aggressively people will tell you what you should do. Worst of all, they tend to be the people most involved in the wedding so you can\u2019t escape them! I find myself avoiding my mother-in-Law because she\u2019s been kind of mean about our choices \u2013 and that\u2019s not how a marriage should begin. She is a well-intentioned, lovely lady, but she keeps poo-pooing our choices and turning our wedding into her family\u2019s reunion. It sucks. Planning a wedding can bring out the worst in people and strain relationships with family and close friends.\n\nElopements Save Money: We are spending 30 percent over what we originally budgeted for our wedding. Once you start adding every little detail together, you realize you are hemorrhaging money. And just a warning: even when you think you don\u2019t need everything fancy and can keep it to a minimum, you will hate the basic chair covers or feel the extra flower arrangements will really \u201cbring everything together.\u201d [Jessica\u2019s Note: This is so true. My husband and I got in an argument at Party City before our wedding because I wanted to buy more expensive napkins. They just looked a lot nicer!] It\u2019s the little stuff that adds up. When we eloped, our fancy dinner and champagne came to $216 and it was pretty darn satisfying when compared to the too-ashamed-to-share-how-expensive-it-actually-is bill we\u2019ll eventually be paying for this wedding.\n\nWe Have A Romantic Secret: One thing I do love about eloping is that once a year my husband and I have a secret day that is super special to us. No one else knows when it is (except maybe the great state of Connecticut). When you get married, you are building a teammate for life and part of maintaining a team is making something binding you together and intangible to others. For me, I really enjoy that my husband and I will always have something no one else can have or touch or really know. Our wedding is for everyone, but our elopement was just for our team of two.\n\nHere\u2019s What\u2019s Better About A Traditional Wedding:\n\nAll The Family Comes: When my husband and I made it legal at the courthouse, I felt sad that no one else was there. And even though I specifically picked a Justice of the Peace named Jane Austen, our ceremony didn\u2019t feel quite as romantic as I had envisioned. We had just enjoyed this momentous occasion between us, but I wanted my parents and siblings there. If you come from a big, festive family, you\u2019re going to want them there.\n\nThe Celebration Is More Enthusiastic: After we eloped, both of us were itching to go out and celebrate. We went to a fancy dinner with champagne, but celebrating is significantly more fun with more people. The celebratory feeling that overtakes you is overwhelming! We wanted to spread our happiness to everyone around us and the randoms at the bar we went to didn\u2019t seem to catch on to our enthusiasm.\n\nIt Feels Like More Of A Milestone: As I\u2019ve gotten older, I\u2019ve realized that life is really just a series of moments with some dull stuff in between. Our day to day is relatively boring and we keep motivated by all the plans we can look towards. A wedding is another one of those fun milestones that people love to celebrate and keep us all looking forward \u2013 even when it\u2019s not your own. It\u2019s the biggest plans you\u2019ll have for a good chunk of time until it is over. Eloping just says you\u2019re married, but a wedding gives you a plan to be excited for (until you find a new one!).\n\n[Image of a wedding chapel via Shutterstock]", "article_metadata": {"description": "Two years ago, I met my husband at a Foreigner concert.
