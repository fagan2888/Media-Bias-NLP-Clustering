While Sebelius faced a crowd that she hoped was on her side and a host typically supportive of liberal initiatives, the following morning\u2019s newspaper and blog headlines read: \u201cJon Stewart Destroys Kathleen Sebelius\u201d and \u201cKathleen Sebelius\u2019 Daily Show Disaster.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s true that Stewart and Sebelius sparred over several Obamacare issues, but it was the mandate that continued to vex the host throughout the interview.\n\nIs the employer mandate delay a sign that the administration is catering to big business? And if not, why is the issue still fit to broadcast?\n\nDetails of Mandates, Delay\n\nUnder the ACA, employers with at least 50 full-time workers must provide affordable health coverage or face a $2,000 fine per worker after the first 30 employees. In early July, the Obama administration announced that it was delaying the employer mandate until 2015 to provide businesses with more time to comply with its reporting requirements.\n\nHouse Republicans, in a letter sent a week after the announcement, questioned the decision to delay the employer mandate but leave the individual mandate intact. They wrote, \u201cPlease \u2026 provide to Congress your justification for only delaying the employer mandate at this time and not the new mandate on individuals and families,\u201d adding, \u201cWe agree with you that the burden was overwhelming for employers, but we also believe American families need the same relief.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, in August, the Treasury Department released a final rule governing how U.S. residents who fail to comply with the Affordable Care Act\u2019s individual mandate will be penalized once the provision takes effect in 2014.\n\nUnder the final rule, nonexempt individuals who fail to purchase insurance must pay a fine of $95 or 1% of the household income, whichever is greater. The annual penalty will increase to $695 per person beginning in 2016 \u2014 or 2.5% of taxable annual income \u2014 with the total amount increasing with inflation.\n\nSebelius\u2019 Defense\n\nOn \u201cThe Daily Show,\u201d Stewart said, \u201c[I]f I\u2019m an individual [who] doesn\u2019t want this \u2026 it would be hard for me to look at a big business getting a waiver. \u2026 I would think you are favoring big businesses who lobbied you to delay it because they didn\u2019t want to do it this year, but you\u2019re not allowing individuals the same courtesy.\u201d\n\nDefending the decision, Sebelius cited mechanisms of financial aid that already are in motion to help individuals buy coverage through state and federal health insurance exchanges. She said, \u201c[I]ndividuals have tax credits coming their way, have financial help for the first time, and the market we are now running is available for them. So that didn\u2019t delay and that didn\u2019t stop.\u201d\n\nWatch a video of the interview below:\n\nHer argument was simple: Nothing that helps an individual pay for insurance next year has been delayed, so why would it be necessary to delay the mandate?\n\nThat answer didn\u2019t really answer Stewart\u2019s question, which he asked again and again throughout the interview in search of a satisfactory answer: Even if individuals will have financial help next year, why can\u2019t they have a delay if large employers can?\n\nExperts Respond\n\nHealth care experts did not hesitate to engage this question directly \u2014 and some did it months before the interview aired on Comedy Central.\n\nIn July, Chris Conover of the Center for Health Policy and Inequalities Research at Duke University wrote in a Forbes\u2018 \u201cThe Apothecary\u201d piece about potentially higher premium rates in the exchanges that could greet some low-income individuals, especially those who are healthy. He said, \u201cWhich leads to the obvious question: if employers need one extra year to \u2018adjust\u2019 to the added burden imposed by Obamacare, why shouldn\u2019t the average American family be given the same relief? At a minimum, if the employer mandate is viewed as too onerous, then how could the individual mandate be any more palatable to the disproportionately low-income families who will confront it next January?\u201d\n\nHowever, more recent analyses have drawn on new data and rebuffed such a notion.\n\nEdwin Park of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities wrote that a similar delay for the individual mandate would not be \u201cfair,\u201d as some commentators and GOP lawmakers posit. First of all, think tanks \u2014 such as RAND Corporation and the Urban Institute \u2014 have found that delaying the employer mandate will barely affect health insurance coverage in that market (95% of large employers already offer health insurance to workers). Conversely, an individual mandate delay \u201cwould cause 11 million more Americans to remain uninsured in 2014,\u201d Park explained, citing Congressional Budget Office data.\n\nJosh Borrow, politics editor for Business Insider, wrote that the difference between the two mandates is \u201cnecessity.\u201d Borrow noted, \u201cIf you don\u2019t have an individual mandate, the risk is that only sick people will buy insurance, and then premiums will skyrocket, making it unaffordable for everyone.\u201d\n\nBasically, if you delay the individual mandate after the markets go live, then you ruin the centerpiece of the law.\n\nThe Big Sign-Off\n\nFew of these angles were covered during \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d interview \u2014 although Sebelius did say that most employers already provide health coverage and that delaying their mandate doesn\u2019t really matter.\n\nThis did not satisfy Stewart, who monologued about the issue one final time at the end of the show: \u201cI still don\u2019t understand why individuals have to sign up and businesses don\u2019t, because \u2026 if she\u2019s saying, \u2018Well, [businesses] get a delay because that doesn\u2019t matter anyway because they already give health care,\u2019 then you think to yourself \u2026 \u2018[T]hen why do they have to sign up at all?'\u201d\n\nStewart closed by saying, \u201cAnd then I think to myself, \u2018Well, maybe she\u2019s just lying to me.'\u201d\n\nAlthough there\u2019s no evidence that anything Sebelius said in the interview is a lie, it\u2019s worth asking why she didn\u2019t hammer home the point about the individual mandate being the centerpiece of the law or quote figures on the negative effect its delay would have. Maybe she was coached to push only the positive aspects of the new marketplaces or was just tired from the previous week\u2019s worth of questions about glitches on the federally run exchange website.\n\nBut because findings on the issue from RAND, Urban Institute and CBO are public, we must also ask why Republicans and some commentators \u2014 including Stewart himself \u2014 continue to ask why an individual mandate delay cannot happen. In Stewart\u2019s case, he\u2019s likely standing up for his audience \u2014 many of whom are healthy young adults wondering why they must purchase health insurance right now \u2014 and building a case for a single-payer system, which he described during the interview as his idea of true health reform. His single-payer argument is solid, but it\u2019s wishful thinking considering that Congress could not even pass a public plan option four years ago and that the more moderate health overhaul of Obamacare still became one of the most controversial laws ever.\n\nPark, of the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, assumed a more dire reason behind Republicans\u2019 calls for delaying the individual mandate, saying they are \u201ca central element of an effort to dismember health reform.\u201d This strategy makes some sense \u2014 skyrocketing premiums resulting from insurance pools filled with only sick people would bring a ton of negative press to the law \u2014 but the notion that the GOP is willing to play that roughly with U.S. residents\u2019 health and incomes on the line is a discouraging one.\n\nYet, such examinations seem more substantive than another back-and-forth on fairness in health insurance, like the interview on \u201cThe Daily Show.\u201d\n\nBorrow in Business Insider neatly summed it up: \u201cThe individual mandate is a tool that improves the overall fairness of the health care market by making insurance coverage broadly available and affordable. That\u2019s why it\u2019s fair. All the rest is noise.\u201d\n\nWeekly Roundup\n\nHere\u2019s a look at more recent health care reform news.\n\nEnrollment Period or Ellipses?: Expert Nick Bagley \u2014 in an email picked up by The Incidental Economist \u2014 says he is 95% sure that the Obama administration will not delay the open enrollment period because of glitches in health care exchange websites.\n\nSolutions in Question: Nicole Fisher at Forbes\u2018 \u201cThe Apothecary\u201d notes that President Obama in a recent speech presented no real solutions for the exchange glitches but sadly doesn\u2019t quite go as far as telling the president that he should learn to code.\n\nHealth Care Costnado: Jaan Sidorov at the Disease Management Care Blog says that early interest in the exchanges \u201ccould be an early sign of an incoming insurance death spiral,\u201d a proverbial torrent that would occur if persons with high levels of risk disproportionately enter the exchanges.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In a \"The Daily Show With Jon Stewart\" interview, HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius found herself unable to rebuff the host's frequent questions about whether it is fair to delay the Affordable Care Act's employer mandate but not its individual mandate.
