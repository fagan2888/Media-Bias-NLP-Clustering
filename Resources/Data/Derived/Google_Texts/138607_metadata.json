Ouellette bought the restaurant a little more than a year ago with three partners.\n\n..\n\nThe restaurant featured 40 years of collected memorabilia and photos of famous people, like actor Henry Fonda, who ate there. The restaurant building was valued at $401,500, according to town officials.\n\n..\n\nAccording to employees, the last person in the restaurant had left just before 9 p.m. The fire was reported just before 10 p.m., and by 11 p.m. the building was engulfed in flames.\n\n\n\nLocal and state fire investigators have completed most of the inspection at the site, but are still interviewing the 40 former Woodshed employees about what they saw.\n\n..\n\nNo cause has been ruled out, according to fire investigator Bill Clark of the state Fire Marshal\u2019s Office, not even arson.\n\n\n\n\u201cNothing has been found as the cause, and nothing has been ruled out,\u201d Clark said. \u201cWe are still interviewing people, and any one of those interviews could lead us to the cause.\u201d\n\n..\n\nBecause the cause of the fire is still unknown, the owners of the restaurant and their insurance companies haven\u2019t made a final decision about rebuilding.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe really can\u2019t do anything now.
