Wyden voted for it. Weaver would repeal it.\n\nWyden\u2019s campaign has raised more than $6 million. Weaver would like to spend less than $750 and won\u2019t be in the voter\u2019s pamphlet because it costs $3,000.\n\nAnd the list goes on and on.\n\n\u201cConventional wisdom would tell you I don\u2019t have a chance but I talk to a lot of people at my level, where I\u2019m coming from,\u201d Weaver said.\n\n\u201cThey tell me how disgusted they are with the way things are going in Washington. If I could touch base with those people, even if I don\u2019t win the vote, if I can get some Democrats that don\u2019t like the Democratic platform or the way things are going in Washington, to vote for me, at least it will send a message to the Democrats.\u201d Weaver has been a registered Democrat since 1979 but broke away from the party during the past two presidential races to vote for John McCain in 2008 and Mitt Romney in 2012.\n\nHe plans to vote for Bernie Sanders in the 2016 Democratic Primary but would prefer Republican Ted Cruz in the November general election.\n\n\u201cI did not vote for [Barack] Obama,\u201d Weaver said. \u201cI did not like the way he was presenting things. He never told us what he was going to do. When I started getting his literature, I switched over to Republican so I wouldn\u2019t get it and then after that was over, I switched back.\u201d\n\nAs a Democrat, Weaver ran against Senator Jeff Merkley as a write-in candidate in 2013.\n\nWeaver has decided to forgo retirement and run for Senate again because he doesn\u2019t like the country that is being left behind to his four children and eight grandchildren. He calls himself a conservative Democrat like past U.S. Presidents Harry Truman and John F. Kennedy.\n\n\u201cWhen Kennedy took over, he stimulated the economy by lowering taxes and the Republicans objected to it and now we\u2019re down to Republicans want to lower taxes and the Democrats object to it,\u201d Weaver said.\n\n\u201cI just think that we need to be working more together and get things done in Washington and clean up the financial mess that\u2019s developed the last 30 years.\u201d\n\nWeaver, who also wants to balance the budget and introduce term limits of 12 years for the House and Senate, said he didn\u2019t think about running for Senate as a Republican but would instead like to return the Democratic Party back to its roots.\n\n\u201cI think the Democratic Party has gone way too far left and if I have a little part about bringing them back to reality, I\u2019d sure like to be a part of it,\u201d he said.\n\nWeaver also has his sights set on Wyden, who has been in Congress since 1981 and served in the Senate since 1996.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s an Oregonian anymore,\u201d Weaver said of Wyden. \u201cHe always talks about going to all of the counties every year and having these town hall meetings. The rest of the time, as far as I know, he spends it in New York City with his wife and kids. They own a home in Manhattan.\u201d\n\nWhen asked how he could possibly defeat Wyden with so many financial disadvantages, Weaver replied, \u201cWith a lot of prayer and people being involved in helping spread the word because I don\u2019t have any money. It\u2019s no advertising and it\u2019s word of mouth.\u201d\n\nWeaver has purchased 5,000 business cards with the slogan, \u201cGod, Family, Country and Constitution,\u201d and a link to his website\u2014www.paulweaver\n\nforussenate.com. He hands them out at the grocery store and goes to as many events, like the Portland Swap Meet, as he can.\n\n\u201cI tell them \u2018That card that you\u2019re looking at is my campaign, share it with people, take pictures of it and put it on Facebook, put it everywhere out there,\u2019\u201d Weaver said. \u201cI get a lot of positive response.\n\nPhysically, I\u2019m limited because it\u2019s just me and my wife but the people I do talk to are very positive and very encouraging. Whether or not that translates into a win on May 17, I\u2019ll keep working until then and we\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msvalidate.01": "6F0F769B18C1F1E5145E5D36120FA2DD", "google-site-verification": "dr1NYOQ7L4IbMMoa9sXvO5M_zmQUi6VBoRGJSuF4BSg", "og": {"url": "http://www.thedalleschronicle.com/news/2016/apr/27/conservative-democrat-runs-senate/", "type": "article", "title": "Conservative Democrat runs for Senate"}, "viewport": "width=1020", "description": "Running in the May 17 primary, Paul Weaver, a retired locomotive engineer residing in Toledo, wants to give Oregon Democrats a clear choice for U.S. Senate.\r\nWeaver is a member of the National Rifle Association, which gives his opponent\u2014incumbent Ron Wyden an F grade. \r\nWeaver is pro-life while Wyden is pro-choice."}, "article_summary": "\u201cThey tell me how disgusted they are with the way things are going in Washington.\nHe calls himself a conservative Democrat like past U.S. Presidents Harry Truman and John F.
