The survey focuses on three areas: overall real estate conditions, access to capital markets, and real estate asset pricing.\n\nTopline findings included the following:\n\nOft-mentioned risks that could seriously affect real estate investments and property valuations include (the inevitable) increase in interest rates and the political uncertainty associated with all things political and Washington;\n\nAs it appears from the Feds statements over the past few weeks, increases in interest rates are likely to play out more slowly than expected; that said, current valuations appear \u201csteep\u201d;\n\nEquity and debt capital for real estate is widely available; and\n\nReturn expectations have been dialed down by some investors who feel we are nearing the top of the current cycle.\n\nWhat makes this survey so popular for some and required reading for others is that readers get a peek at the actual unedited and unfiltered written comments of survey participants.\n\nWhile the survey remains positive, we think its tone is beginning to reflect increasing concerns and questions regarding how fast we\u2019ve come to the current nexus.\n\nThe Boiling-Frog Syndrome\n\nWe thank Moody\u2019s Investors Service for reminding us of the dangers of \u201cboiling-frog syndrome\u201d in a research report published earlier this year. First, from Wikipedia, the free online encyclopedia:\n\n\u201cThe boiling-frog story is a widespread anecdote describing a frog slowly being boiled alive. The premise is that if a frog is placed in boiling water, it will jump out, but if it is placed in cold water that is slowly heated, it will not perceive the danger and will be cooked to death. The story is often used as a metaphor for the inability or unwillingness of people to react to significant changes that occur gradually, such as climate change.\u201d\n\nIs the real estate investment and finance business nearing its own boiling-frog moment? How else would you describe the steady progression of incremental declines in capitalization rates, the gravity-defying (low) level of interest rates combined with the availability of unlimited amounts of mortgage capital, the seeming collapse of risk premiums, increasingly higher loan-to-value ratios, lower debt yields and reduced debt-coverage ratios, increasingly lengthy periods of interest-only mortgage payments, forays into secondary and tertiary markets, acquisition of never-before-owned property types, implementing new investment strategies (i.e., such as value-added), and both the regulators and the rating agencies pointedly discussing deteriorating underwriting standards and procedures?\n\nCertainly, Hell is not going to freeze over on any near-term basis, and real estate investment and finance are not in line for another 2007-to-2009-type experience. But we may be facing an inflection period, as transaction volume continues to increase, huge amounts of capital from a wide array of sources are waiting impatiently on the sidelines, and investors and lenders alike are close to knee-deep in the secondary and tertiary markets.\n\nAs we near year-end, let\u2019s resolve to put our houses in order by reviewing and revising our business plans, dusting off and updating our \u201cPlan Bs,\u201d refinancing every property we can, and so on. You know the drill.\n\nThe capital markets remain fragile as evidenced by last week\u2019s gyrations in the indices, and the ever-present likelihood of a \u201cblack swan\u201d geopolitical/economic/cyber event upsetting the apple cart remains elevated.\n\nStephen Blank, ULI\u2019s Senior Fellow, Real Estate, to Retire at Year-end\n\nAfter 17 years with ULI as its senior fellow, finance, I have decided to retire, effective December 31, 2014.\n\nDuring my tenure with ULI, we were able to make measurable progress in expanding the Institute\u2019s real estate finance and capital markets information and education programs, including transforming Emerging Trends in Real Estate into a global brand; expanding the scope of the invitation-only ULI/McCoy Symposium on Real Estate Finance; speaking, moderating, and acting as a panelist at ULI and real estate industry events worldwide; using the Institute\u2019s website as a vehicle for distributing current information, developing and teaching in-house and online courses on real estate finance, and being a founding member of ULI\u2019s Responsible Property Investment Product Council.\n\nMy thanks to the many members and nonmembers who have taken the time over the years to post comments, suggestions, and well-deserved criticisms; all were welcome and helped shape the program of work.\n\nBest wishes to all for a happy and healthy new year.\n\nSteve\n\nMonday\u2019s Numbers\n\nIf many of the following numbers look familiar, they should; because of the Christmas\u2013New Year holiday period, our usual data sources will be not be updating their surveys until the first or second week of January 2015.\n\nAsking Spreads over U.S. Ten-Year Treasury Bonds in Basis Points\n\n(Ten-year commercial and multifamily mortgage loans\n\nfor properties with 50 to 59 percent loan-to-value ratios) Individual investors 12/31/10 12/31/11 12/31/12 12/31/13 Last week\n\n(12/12/14) Week before last\n\n(12/5/14) Month earlier Office 214 210 210 162 147 149 148 Retail 207 207 192 160 143 141 139 Multifamily 188 202 182 157 137 138 135 Industrial 201 205 191 159 141 141 142 Averagespread 203 205 194 160 145 142 141 10-yearTreasury 3.29% 2.88% 1.64% 3.04% 2.10% 2.18% 2.37%\n\nThe Cushman & Wakefield Equity, Debt, and Structured Finance Group\u2019s monthly Capital Markets Update of commercial real estate mortgage spreads dated December 18, 2014, showed rates unchanged as compared with the prior survey period.\n\n30-Year Fixed-Rate Commercial Real Estate Mortgages\n\n(as of December 18, 2014) Property Maximum\n\nloan-to-value Class A Class B/C Multifamily (agency) 75\u201380% T +160 T +170 Multifamily (nonagency) 70\u201375% T +170 T +175 Anchored retail 70\u201375% T +185 T +195 Strip center 65\u201370% T +185 T +195 Distribution/warehouse 65\u201370% T +185 T +195 R&D/flex/industrial 65\u201370% T +190 T +200 Office 65\u201375% T +180 T +190 Full-service hotel 55\u201365% T +235 T + 255 Debt-service-coverage ratio assumed to be greater than 1.35 to 1.\n\nYear-to-Date Public Equity Capital Markets\n\nDow Jones Industrial Average: +7.41 percent\n\nStandard & Poor\u2019s 500 Stock Index: +12.03 percent\n\nNASD Composite Index (NASDAQ): +14.10 percent\n\nRussell 2000: +2.78 percent\n\nMorgan Stanley U.S. REIT Index: +22.51 percent\n\nYear-to-Date Global CMBS Issuance\n\n(in $ billions as of 12/12/14) 2014 2013 U.S. $90.4 $83.3 Non-U.S. 5.8 12.5 Total $96.2 $95.9 Source: Commercial Mortgage Alert.\n\nYear-to-Date U.S. Treasury Yields", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Urban Land Magazine", "description": "The Real Estate Roundtable released the results of its fourth-quarter 2014 Sentiment Survey.
