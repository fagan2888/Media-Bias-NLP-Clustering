Lincoln for less than two months, from July 28, 2014 to Sept. 26, 2014. (Source: KPHO/KTVK)\n\nThe call center will be open from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m., Monday Friday, and 8 a.m. to 6 p.m., Saturday and Sunday. (Source: MGN Online)\n\nA surgical technician who is at the center of a case that led to communicable disease testing for nearly 3,000 patients of a Colorado hospital has been identified as a former employee of John C. Lincoln Medical Center.\n\nRocky Allen worked at John C. Lincoln for less than two months, from July 28, 2014 to Sept. 26, 2014, according to a hospital statement. He was fired for violating workplace policy after he tested positive for use of a controlled substance.\n\nThe 28-year-old Allen is accused of stealing a powerful narcotic drug at Swedish Medical Center in Colorado and switching syringes. Hospital officials in that state have launched a massive testing program over concern that syringes tainted with bloodborne viruses like HIV and hepatitis could have been used on patients. Allen has since left Colorado, according to reports.\n\nJohn C. Lincoln Medical Center officials said they have not identified any harm to patients.\n\nTo be on the safe side, though, John C. Lincoln is offering free hepatitis B, hepatitis C and HIV testing to any patient who had a surgery in which Allen served as a surgical technician. The medical center said it has identified 97 patients who were in a surgery during which Allen served as a technician.\n\n\u201cAlthough the likelihood that patients were exposed is extremely low, we will be contacting patients directly by phone and certified mail with instructions about testing,\u201d according to Jeff Holeman, network director of communications for HonorHealth marketing & communications.\n\n\u201cAt this point we have no evidence of any patient exposure, but in the interest of patient safety, we're taking a position of extreme caution,\u201d he said.\n\nAny patient who had surgery from July 28, 2014 to Sept. 26, 2014 can contact John C. Lincoln at 623-580-5800, starting Sunday, Feb. 14, at 8 a.m. The call center will be open from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m., Monday-Friday, and 8 a.m. to 6 p.m., Saturday and Sunday.\n\n\u201cAs soon as we found out about the Colorado incident and became aware that Allen was our former employee, we immediately began looking into the matter,\u201d Holeman said.\n\nHe said John C. Lincoln is working in close collaboration with the Maricopa County Department of Public Health and the Arizona Department of Health Services.\n\n\u201cBecause of the situation in Colorado, we are taking action to ensure the well-being of our patients,\u201d Holeman said. \u201cProviding complimentary testing is the right thing to do.\u201d\n\nHe said the situation that happened in Phoenix \u201cis an isolated, unfortunate situation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no evidence at this time that what happened in Colorado happened here,\u201d he stressed.\n\n\u201cTo ensure patient safety, we are conducting a comprehensive review of our policies and procedures related to controlled substances,\u201d Holeman added.\n\nCopyright 2016 KPHO/KTVK (KPHO Broadcasting Corporation).
