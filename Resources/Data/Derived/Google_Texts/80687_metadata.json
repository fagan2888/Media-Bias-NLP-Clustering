Herring wrote in an advisory opinion dated Thursday that the ban, which is set to expire in July, \u201cprohibits the use of even a single remotely controlled aerial vehicle by state or local law enforcement for the purpose of gathering evidence pursuant to a search warrant.\u201d\n\nSEE ALSO: Virginia county revives debate about domestic drones\n\nVirginia lawmakers are expected to come back to the drawing board in next year\u2019s legislative session to debate drone use. But for now the standing moratorium bans government agencies from flying drones except in a handful of circumstances: in searches for missing children or seniors, for research purposes by universities and by the Virginia National Guard.\n\nLaw enforcement recently used drones to aid in the search for missing University of Virginia student Hannah Graham.\n\nIn a July 10 letter requesting an opinion from Mr. Herring, Wise County Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney Ron Elkins posed the question of whether the Wise County sheriff\u2019s office could use their two small, remote-controlled \u201cquad copters\u201d for other purposes. With a bit of wordsmithing, he noted that the moratorium approved by the Virginia General Assembly forbids the use of \u201can unmanned aircraft system.\u201d\n\nHe argued that use of a single drone \u201caccording to the parameters of a specific search warrant\u201d would not count as the use of a system as banned by lawmakers. Rather, he reasoned that the use of a squadron of drones used to regularly catch motorists who speed or run red lights would be more akin to a \u201csystem.\u201d\n\nIn his opinion, Mr. Herring disagreed, writing that \u201cthe term \u2018unmanned aircraft system,\u2019 in conformity with its accepted industry definition, encompasses a single unmanned aerial vehicle that has corresponding equipment and controls permitting its remote use by a human operator.\u201d\n\nUse of drones for \u201cspecified humanitarian purposes\u201d such as search and rescue missions remains a legal use under the moratorium, Mr. Herring wrote.\n\nA spokesman for Mr. Herring said his office had no additional comment, and would let the opinion speak for itself.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Virginia's attorney general affirmed that the use of drones by law enforcement to gather evidence or in conjunction with a search warrant is not allowed under the state's current drone ban.", "Author": "Andrea Noble", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Virginia\u2019s attorney general affirmed that the use of drones by law enforcement to gather evidence or in conjunction with a search warrant is not allowed under the state\u2019s current drone ban.", "title": "Drones can\u2019t be used in Va. for search warrants, gathering evidence: AG", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/oct/10/drones-cant-be-used-va-search-warrants-ag/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/05/11/63f6fdf40b129e12530f6a7067009dcc.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/05/11/63f6fdf40b129e12530f6a7067009dcc.jpg", "title": "Drones can\u2019t be used in Va. for search warrants, gathering evide", "description": "Virginia's attorney general affirmed that the use of drones by law enforcement to gather evidence or in conjunction with a search warrant is not allowed under the state's current drone ban.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Law Crime, Mark R Herring, Virginia Attorney, Ron Elkins"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfcf3\"", "article_summary": "Law enforcement recently used drones to aid in the search for missing University of Virginia student Hannah Graham.\nRather, he reasoned that the use of a squadron of drones used to regularly catch motorists who speed or run red lights would be more akin to a \u201csystem.\u201dIn his opinion, Mr.\nVirginia\u2019s attorney general affirmed that the use of drones by law enforcement to gather evidence or in conjunction with a search warrant is not allowed under the state\u2019s current drone ban.\nHerring said his office had no additional comment, and would let the opinion speak for itself.\nHerring, Wise County Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney Ron Elkins posed the question of whether the Wise County sheriff\u2019s office could use their two small, remote-controlled \u201cquad copters\u201d for other purposes."}
