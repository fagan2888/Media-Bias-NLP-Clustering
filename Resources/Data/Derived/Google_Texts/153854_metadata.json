CREDIT: Facebook The women behind the \"Don't Give it to a Russian\" campaign\n\nIn the wake of Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea and the escalating tensions in the region, some Ukrainian women are calling for an unusual addition to a widespread boycott of Russian goods. The new campaign, \u201cDon\u2019t Give It to a Russian,\u201d is encouraging Ukrainian women to withhold sex from Russian men as a method of fighting the enemy \u201cby whatever means.\u201d The organizers have created shirts with logos that resemble the female genitalia to spread their message.\n\nThe creative campaign \u2014 which borrows its name from a 19th-century Ukrainian poem that encouraged young women to \u201cfall in love, but not with the Moskaly [Russians]\u201d \u2014 has already spread quickly among Russian internet users. It\u2019s also been getting some predictable backlash; a few Russian bloggers have already denounced the organizers as \u201cprostitutes.\u201d\n\nOf course, this is hardly the first sex strike in history. This tactic can be traced back to the fifth-century Greek play Lysistrata, in which women withhold sex from their husbands to convince them to end the Peloponnesian War. Since then, women in Liberia, Colombia, the Philippines, Japan, Kenya, Italy, Togo, and here in the United States have attempted to use abstinence as a tool to enact social change. It\u2019s not even the first time organizers have tried to rally Ukrainian women to withhold sex \u2014 in 2010, the activist group Femen called on women to launch a sex boycott over sexist statements made by the prime minister.\n\nSex boycotts are definitely good at grabbing headlines. But are they effective tools to accomplish policy goals?\n\nIt depends. As Slate notes, this tactic tends to have the most success under specific circumstances: \u201cWhen the women involved have little economic autonomy, when their demands are specific and realistic, and when they possess endurance and strength in numbers.\u201d For instance, 300 women in rural Columbia withheld sex for months, demanding that the government pave a road to their isolated town \u2014 and government officials eventually gave in. And a group of women in a Filipino village successfully convinced their husbands to stop fighting with each other after they withheld sex for a week.\n\nOn the other hand, bigger political demands tend to fall short. Activists in Togo called for a sex strike in 2012, arguing it represented the \u201cbest weapon against dictatorship\u201d in their nation \u2014 but the same ruler remains in power today. And when U.S. women called for a sex strike to help curb the War on Women, it didn\u2019t have any effect on the mounting number of state laws enacted to chip away at reproductive rights.\n\nSometimes the media attention itself can help further activists\u2019 ultimate goals. Leymah Gbowee, who led a group of women in a sex strike to help end a civil war in Liberia, acknowledges that the protest had \u201clittle or no practical effect,\u201d but was invaluable in helping to raise attention for the cause. \u201cWe withheld sex from our spouses to get attention, and our husbands obviously noticed what we were doing. We said, \u2018we need you to take a stand.\u2019 And they did,\u201d Gbowee explained in an interview with the Huffington Post.\n\nIn countries where withholding sex is perhaps the only political capital available to women, it can be inspiring to see individuals using the tools at their disposal to fight for social change. But wielding female sexuality as a weapon has consequences, too. It furthers the worldview that men are entitled to sex, and essentially have a contractual relationship with the women who provide it for them, rather than approaching a sexual relationship on equal and consensual grounds. It also reinforces the message that women\u2019s power must come from their bodies, and particularly the way they use those bodies in relation to men.\n\nAnd it\u2019s perhaps important to remember that in many instances of conflict, women don\u2019t necessarily have the bodily autonomy to use sex as a weapon. Much more frequently, their bodies are used against them, as girls and women across the globe are raped as an act of warfare.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Are sex strikes actually an effective strategy for women to wield their power?", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "Are sex strikes actually an effective strategy for women to wield their power?", "title": "Ukrainian Women Are Calling For A \u2018Sex Strike\u2019 Against Russians \u2014 But Will It Work?", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2014/03/26/3419137/sex-strike-russian-men/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/dont-give-it-to-russian.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Are sex strikes actually an effective strategy for women to wield their power?", "creator": "@Tara_CR", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/dont-give-it-to-russian-321x214.jpg", "title": "Ukrainian Women Are Calling For A \u2018Sex Strike\u2019 Against Russians \u2014 But Will It Work?", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/dont-give-it-to-russian.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/dont-give-it-to-russian.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-03-26T11:30:45+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/tculpressler"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0d44\"", "article_summary": "Health Ukrainian Women Are Calling For A \u2018Sex Strike\u2019 Against Russians \u2014 But Will It Work?\n\u201cWe withheld sex from our spouses to get attention, and our husbands obviously noticed what we were doing.\nIt\u2019s not even the first time organizers have tried to rally Ukrainian women to withhold sex \u2014 in 2010, the activist group Femen called on women to launch a sex boycott over sexist statements made by the prime minister.\nThis tactic can be traced back to the fifth-century Greek play Lysistrata, in which women withhold sex from their husbands to convince them to end the Peloponnesian War.\nAnd a group of women in a Filipino village successfully convinced their husbands to stop fighting with each other after they withheld sex for a week."}
