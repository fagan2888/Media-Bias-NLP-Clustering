Myxie thought it was a shark but she couldn\u2019t really see anything and when we brought her into shore the paramedic thought it could have been a small shark,\u201d Ms Ryan said.\n\nMyxie was rushed to the Lismore Base Hospital, about 45 minutes from Lennox Head.\n\nOn Wednesday \u2013 the day after the fish or shark attack \u2013 Myxie underwent 3.5 hours of surgery to try and repair the severed nerves and tendon in her thumb.\n\n\u201cShe was in a bit of pain but the adrenaline and shock meant she didn\u2019t really know what was going on,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve tried their best to put it back together. There was a fair bit of skin missing on the wound. Myxie was actually upset about her cut wetsuit.\u201d\n\nMs Ryan said Dembe, 9, had already got back in the surf and her daughter was keen to get her cast off and paddle out.\n\n\u201cHe was a good little brother and helped bring her back in to shore. When it all happened he was pretty upset for his sister.\u201d\n\nMyxie and her mum spent the weekend at Sydney Olympic Park where she was set to compete in the 800m, 1500m and 1100m walk at the state athletics titles.\n\n\u201cThe funny thing is I had been telling her for weeks to be careful and to not hurt herself on the skateboard and then this happened.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe has been told she needs to keep her thumb out of the water for 6 to 8 weeks but she\u2019s keen to make that four weeks if she can.\u201d\n\nMyxie\u2019s father Craig has surfed Lennox Head for more than 20 years and has seen sharks and the family know they are in their territory.\n\nIt's hard to know what it was and we'll probably never know\n\nIn the frantic moments after the attack, NSW Ambulance tweeted that they were \u201ctreating a girl at #LennoxHead for a significant hand injury after allegedly being bitten in the water by a shark\u201d and the story went viral.\n\nFar North Coast surf life saving co-ordinator Jimmy Keogh said there had been no sightings of sharks or bait fish in the area around the time of the attack.\n\nAll Girls Surfriders Lennox Head president Berenice Roberts told The Sunday Telegraph it could have been a mackerel, tailor or small shark that had nipped Myxie.\n\nMyxie will return to school this week.\n\nEvery day after school, the 10-year-old and her brother Dembe make the short walk down to the Main Beach at Lennox Head. On day 95 of their challenge, the pair paddled out to the breakers about 20m from shore when Myxie felt a sting.\n\nThe Lennox Head Public School student didn\u2019t see what got her but her little brother could see the blood.\n\nMum Natasha had just \u00adarrived at the beach when her daughter, a member of the All Girls Surfriders, was bitten by what she still believes was a small shark.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to know what it was and we\u2019ll probably never know,\u201d she said. \u201cMyxie thought it was a shark but she couldn\u2019t really see anything and when we brought her in to shore the paramedic thought it could have been a small shark.\u201d\n\nMyxie was rushed to the Lismore Base Hospital, about 45 minutes from Lennox Head.
