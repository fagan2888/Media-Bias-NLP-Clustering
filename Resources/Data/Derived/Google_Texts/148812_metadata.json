Central Press/Getty Images\n\nLong before glitz and glamour came to accompany corporate packages, Ernest Hemingway likened expats to addicts: \u201cYou\u2019ve lost touch with the soil. You get precious. Fake European standards have ruined you. You drink yourself to death. You become obsessed with sex. You spend all your time talking, not working. You are an expatriate, see? You hang around cafes.\u201d\n\nThe accusations have stuck, with a few updates through the ages. According to critics, today\u2019s expats are adventure-junkies who live like royalty outside their home countries. They\u2019re hooked on domestic helpers and padded salaries. A heady cocktail of money, status and adrenaline is their drug.\n\nBut is this really the nature of the expat \u201caddiction\u201d? Are expats a shallow group roaming the globe with fat wallets in search of the next challenge high? Or does the lifestyle offer people something more attractive: a quality of life that satisfies the desire to feel like a self-determined individual?\n\nIt is impossible to make a sweeping statement about the thousands of expats around the world. Some go abroad to escape poor economies, while others want international experience on their resumes. Some are backpacker-like explorers of culture, and there are the opportunists after the corporate package and domestic staff. Motivations, lifestyles and tenures mix and match so much it almost renders the word \u201cexpat\u201d meaningless.\n\nHowever, across all walks of expat life, many foreigners are united in their hesitation to \u201cgo back,\u201d a description that often means more than just going home and implies returning to a previous state.\n\nIt isn\u2019t about the money, says Natalia Timmerman Blotskaya, a Belarussian expat of more than 20 years who has lived in the Middle East, Europe and Asia on both local and corporate packages. She says the moment people become expats, they enter a whole new state of mind.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like becoming a Switzerland, neutral \u2013 politically and emotionally \u2013 and experiencing a culture without having to be involved with the internal affairs.\u201d\n\nAre expat perks like frequent travel addictive? Some say yes. Getty Images\n\nThis is where the buzz of the lifestyle begins. Set apart from familiar external influences, some expats stop worrying about pressures to mold and keep the people around them happy. The challenge of living in a new place lets them see themselves as individuals rather than citizens of a specific country or members of a culture. This gives them a whole new internal perspective.\n\n\u201cIn time away from your \u2018home\u2019 environment, you can step away from all those things that have influenced your whole life and reflect on \u2018who am I?\u2019\u201d says Nicola Boughton-Smith, a Briton who has spent 7 \u00bd years abroad, with time split between North America and Asia. \u201cYou can deconstruct the things that have made you who you are.\u201d\n\nFor many, this process is liberating. Free from responsibility to family, culture, social pressures and history, they feel more in control of their own identity. This can lead to the arrogance and selfishness that sparks most expat stereotypes. But it can also lead to more tolerance and empathy.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve changed so much as an expat,\u201d says Linda Eunson, a Canadian who has spent 21 years in Singapore. \u201cI\u2019m more tolerant, have adopted different ways of doing things and am much more open\u2026I feel like a citizen of the world, a jet-setter and that feels pretty cool.\u201d\n\nThe effect snowballs. The more open and comfortable an expat becomes, the more he\u2019s able to network and make friends.\n\n\u201cThe ability to just randomly meet people is addictive,\u201d says Todd Middagh, a Canadian who has lived in Asia for 13 years. \u201cThere is no fear, no problem talking to people.\u201d Soon, one\u2019s group of friends can stretch around the globe.\n\nBeing part of this international community also can give expats access to new opportunities and ideas, and can help them feel more confident, both professionally and personally. Living temporarily planted can also soften fears of failure. Foreigners are sometimes granted unspoken permission to try things that might be discouraged in their home countries. The combination can lead expats to take more risks.\n\n\u201cNo matter how sour or discontent your previous experience was, the expat life always offers another chance to make it all different,\u201d says Ms. Blotskaya. \u201cYou can make amends with the mistakes you\u2019ve done or miscalculations and start anew.\u201d\n\nThe more challenges many expats overcome, the more they enjoy the adrenaline of feeling themselves grow. After awhile, this becomes the new normal and makes life \u201cback home\u201d seem boring in comparison.\n\nWhich is why so many expats \u2013 regardless of financial or social standing \u2013 resist giving up the lifestyle. Abroad, they feel free, independent, adventurous, curious, valued for their skills and self-aware. \u201cAs an expat, I have the ability to live in a foreign country and just be left alone to do,\u201d says Mr. Middagh.\n\nIn other words, a distilled sense of oneself in relationship to the world is the real expat \u201cdrug.\u201d But this isn\u2019t toxic, most expats argue. It\u2019s a fantastic way of experiencing life.\n\nRashmi J. Dalai is a Singapore-based freelance writer who just completed a seven year stint in Shanghai.
