(AP) - Andrew Collins no longer has a cocktail of 17 prescriptions coursing through his body.\n\nThe Army combat veteran stared death in the face while serving two tours of Iraq in the 2000s. He now battles post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of his wartime experiences.\n\nThe Olympia veteran has tried medications, meditation and hypnosis while adapting to the stresses of life in the civilian world. But more than any other treatment, Collins says marijuana has helped him cope with the psychological trauma he carries around \u2014 trauma that at times has filled his head with aggression and suicidal thoughts.\n\n\u201cI smoke a joint and the thoughts are gone,\u201d said Collins, 30.\n\nHe said medical marijuana has replaced most of those government-approved prescriptions he had been taking. \u201cI was overmedicated.\u201d\n\nCollins has launched a support group called Twenty22Many (pronounced \u201ctwenty-two too many\u201d), which is focused on reducing suicide rates among military veterans with help from medical marijuana.\n\nTwenty22Many meets every other Sunday at Rainier Xpress, a medical marijuana dispensary in downtown Olympia. The group got its name from a sobering statistic from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs: An average of 22 veterans commit suicide every day \u2014 or nearly 8,000 per year.\n\nHowever, some sources suggest the rate might be higher because only 21 states have submitted data to the department. Notable states missing from the report include California and Texas.\n\nThe Department of Veterans Affairs reports that \u201cPTSD has been found to be a risk factor\u201d for suicidal thoughts, which are often triggered by combat-related guilt that \u201ccan often overpower the emotional coping capacities of veterans.\u201d\n\nSome academic studies suggest a link between medical marijuana and a reduction in suicide rates and PTSD symptoms. In 2013, the American Journal of Public Health reported that suicides among men ages 20-39 were reduced by an average of 10.8 percent in states that have legalized medical marijuana compared to states that have not. In addition, a 2014 study by New Mexico psychiatrist Dr. George Greer concluded that marijuana provided relief for PTSD symptoms in 75 percent of patients in a controlled study.\n\nOther reports show potential drawbacks to treating PTSD with cannabis. For example, an individual could build up a tolerance to the drug\u2019s sleep-inducing effects, leading to increased use. Cannabis also comes with a high relapse rate for those trying to quit, according to a 2014 study co-authored by Marcel Bonn-Miller, clinical psychologist with the Department of Veterans Affairs. The study notes the likelihood of sleep disturbances due to cannabis use and withdrawal, along with reductions of activity in the brain\u2019s prefrontal cortex, which plays a key role in regulating sleep.\n\nA 2015 report published by Addiction Science and Clinical Practice says that PTSD is associated with \u201cgreater odds of a cannabis use disorder diagnosis,\u201d which describes significant impairment or distress caused by using the drug. \u201cCannabis use disorders have been associated with poorer PTSD treatment outcomes,\u201d according to the report, which acknowledges the lack of scientific evidence to support marijuana as a treatment for PTSD.\n\nFor many veterans, the positives outweigh the negatives. Rainier Xpress owner Patrick Seifert has been a tireless advocate for medical marijuana, especially for veterans. Seifert estimates he has helped more than 2,000 veterans at the Olympia dispensary, which includes a \u201cwall of honor\u201d for his military patients.\n\n\u201cTo me, the 22 a day is absolutely unacceptable,\u201d Seifert said of the veteran suicide rate. \u201cEvery one of those women and men who die have a belly full of pharmaceuticals that they got from the VA.\u201d\n\nSeifert has lobbied the Legislature to reform marijuana laws and points to a major victory in the movement. Effective July 24, PTSD and traumatic brain injury will be considered qualifying conditions for medical marijuana authorization in Washington.\n\nIn addition, Seifert has created the PTS Pen with veterans in mind. About 25 veterans are testing his prototype vaporizer and have agreed to keep a journal about the device\u2019s effectiveness in treating symptoms.\n\n\u201cPTSD isn\u2019t just a veteran issue,\u201d said Seifert, who served with the Marine Corps during the first Gulf War. \u201cIt\u2019s a human issue.\u201d\n\nOlympia resident and Twenty22Many board member Dante Cammarata has suffered from PTSD since his deployment to Iraq in 2003 as an Army medic. Medical marijuana has provided relief without the side effects of pharmaceuticals, he said.\n\nCammarata supports holistic and alternative treatments to the standard prescriptions from military doctors. One particular group he has tried to reach \u201cbefore the pills get them\u201d is active-duty soldiers with PTSD who are about to transition to civilian life without a support system in place.\n\n\u201cThis is a viable alternative,\u201d he said of marijuana, noting that without it, \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019d still be here.\u201d\n\nTwenty22Many will lead an awareness march and rally starting at 12:30 p.m. July 22 on the steps of the State Capitol. At 1 p.m., the group will march to Sylvester Park, where veterans are encouraged to speak about their experiences. Following a free community meal for veterans at 5:30 p.m., the event will feature a panel of guest speakers including Dr. Sue Sisley, who is known for her medical marijuana research.\n\nSisley, who lives in Arizona, has been commissioned by Colorado to study marijuana\u2019s effects on veterans with PTSD. The study has been delayed because the National Institute for Drug Abuse must provide federally grown samples of marijuana that are authorized for research.\n\nSisley said the anecdotal evidence is compelling, and she said she hopes more veterans will consider marijuana as an option for treating PTSD.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s surprising how many thousands of veterans are using it on the black market and just can\u2019t come out of the shadows,\u201d she told The Olympian. \u201cI feel we have a duty to these veterans to study this in a vigorous way.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Olympian, http://www.theolympian.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "Andrew Collins no longer has a cocktail of 17 prescriptions coursing through his body.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Andrew Collins no longer has a cocktail of 17 prescriptions coursing through his body.", "title": "Olympia vets: Switch from pharmaceuticals to pot", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jul/18/olympia-vets-switch-from-pharmaceuticals-to-pot/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/07/18/abab91713d1a1d1f7c0f6a706700bded.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/07/18/abab91713d1a1d1f7c0f6a706700bded.jpg", "description": "Andrew Collins no longer has a cocktail of 17 prescriptions coursing through his body.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Olympia vets: Switch from pharmaceuticals to pot"}, "Author": "ANDY HOBBS", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe191c\"", "article_summary": "Twenty22Many meets every other Sunday at Rainier Xpress, a medical marijuana dispensary in downtown Olympia.\nMedical marijuana has provided relief without the side effects of pharmaceuticals, he said.\nHe said medical marijuana has replaced most of those government-approved prescriptions he had been taking.\nEffective July 24, PTSD and traumatic brain injury will be considered qualifying conditions for medical marijuana authorization in Washington.\n\u201cTo me, the 22 a day is absolutely unacceptable,\u201d Seifert said of the veteran suicide rate."}
