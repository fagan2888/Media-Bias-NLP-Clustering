On Thursday, May 29, the California Senate passed a bill that would mandate obesity, diabetes, and tooth decay warning labels on sugary soft drinks. The bill now moves to the state assembly, and if it passes, to Gov/ Brown to sign into law.\n\nIt\u2019s no wonder Michael Bloomberg, who still reigns as king of the Nanny State, loved it so much.\n\nFans of \u201cFed Up\u201d seem to believe that sugar is the new tobacco and we need warning labels, marketing restrictions and heavy excise taxes to protect not only children, but adults, from making choices the activists think are unwise. But why compare sugar to tobacco, when you can say it is \u201cjust like\u201d heroin? That\u2019s what best-selling author and advocate Dr. Mark Hyman says in the film to manipulate emotions and claim that \u201cyou are going become an addict.\u201d That\u2019s the type of language that earned Hyman a coveted clip in the movie trailer. It won\u2019t help Americans be healthier.\n\nDoes the film give viewers an unbiased and factually balanced perspective on obesity in the United States?My answer is more succint than Mayor Bloomberg\u2019s one-word review. \u201cNo.\u201d\n\nIn fact, as I wrote for Politix,\n\n\u201cFed-Up\u201d is less a documentary, more an \u201cargue-mentary\u201d. Food police activists love the film - not only because they all seem to be in it. But because \u201cFed-Up\u201d pushes the premise that obesity is caused by industry and government, while \u201cpersonal responsibility\u201d is just a canard cooked up by \u201cbig food\u201d to lull us into reckless Twinkie-eating automatons.\n\nLaurie David even admits the film was meant to advance the nanny-state agenda.\n\nWhile the film never keeps the viewer guessing about who is to blame for obesity, (not the person with the fork,) advocates complain the film didn\u2019t go far enough because it didn\u2019t propose any actual policy solutions. But David dropped the ball, perhaps hoping the public wasn\u2019t paying attention to her talk at an elite Capitol Hill screening. \u201cWhatever issue you\u2019re working on, [\u201cFed Up\u201d] will help move that agenda,\u201d David told her DC soldiers.\n\nRead the entire piece on Politix, here.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"description": "In a piece featured on Politix today, I explain what&#8217;s going on behind the scenes in Kat...", "title": "Celebrity-Studded Anti-Obesity Film Is Pure\u00a0Propaganda - Amy Ridenour's National Center Blog - A Conservative Blog"}, "blogburst-verify": "B9EORVLmLdD0z2JKwETUEmoZ", "Robots": "index,follow"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9e10\"", "article_summary": "\u201cA masterpiece.\u201dAs my piece details,The film lays the groundwork for the nanny state food policies that Bloomberg and others are pushing.\nFood police activists love the film - not only because they all seem to be in it.\nLaurie David even admits the film was meant to advance the nanny-state agenda.\nIt\u2019s no wonder Michael Bloomberg, who still reigns as king of the Nanny State, loved it so much.\nOn Thursday, May 29, the California Senate passed a bill that would mandate obesity, diabetes, and tooth decay warning labels on sugary soft drinks."}
