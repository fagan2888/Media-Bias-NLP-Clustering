Which person do you think will better recall the information? The former can use their digital notes to create something new that builds on the topic, the latter \u2013 not so easy.\n\nYet we still keep reading reports, such as one recently in New Scientist, which suggest that writing notes on paper gives a person a definite advantage in terms of remembering content. That report was based in part on an article in Psychological Science on the advantages written notes have over those typed on laptops.\n\nRelated: Innovation - What It Really Takes to Market a Good Idea\n\nThe argument has been around for many years and is usually based on the idea that handwriting is slow and deliberate which allows the reader a deeper understanding of ideas and information, and therefore a better ability to remember it.\n\nThat, so the argument goes, is at odds with digitally recording ideas which typically is a quick, haphazard action that limits understanding and therefore recall.\n\nSimilar arguments are made over our ability to remember things that we read from a screen, such as a smartphone, tablet or e-reader, as opposed to a paper-printed form. My question, though, is should memorising information still be a priority?\n\nRemember Back When \u2026\n\nTime shapes knowledge and how we work with it. If it didn\u2019t, we\u2019d still be waiting on those handwritten books produced at the monastery. Important changes have emerged regarding the ideas and information available to us, and the ways we can engage with them that are worth considering.\n\nRelated: How Cost-Saving Innovations Are a Boon to the Middle Class\n\nWe now have more information available to us than ever. There\u2019s almost an infinite number of ideas and resources available at the tip of our keyboard, and the information is not just presented in writing. Digital technology allows a range of visual, audio and word based information and ideas. On a daily basis we can access podcasts, vlogs, videos, audio recordings and animations to name just a few.\n\nIn addition, the interactive aspect of screen-based content means that we can do more with the information and ideas than just read them. We are reading more than ever (three times more since the 1980s) but interactive components allow us to work with and develop information in many different ways.\n\nIt\u2019s common for children today to be able to create a multimodal presentation for a school project which has writing, images, video, sound, animation features and hyperlinks to websites. The days of photocopying information for a project and gluing it to cardboard are long gone. Against this backdrop, the question of whether we should be expected to, or even need to remember large amounts of information to develop knowledge becomes more complex.\n\nDeciding What We Need to Remember\n\nThere are of course times when we need to remember information but there are many more times when we do not \u2013 our smartphone usually helps us with whatever we need. Both standpoints have their value depending on the circumstance.\n\nRelated: How Online Education Can Save Our Universities\n\nWe need to remember things such as mum\u2019s birthday, things that are beneficial to our health and well being and those things that can cause us harm such as certain poisonous things, or how to get from home to work (although in all cases we can let technology remind us). At times we also need to understand some ideas deeply and have a very good memory of them, such as, knowing how to drive a car or how to do our job. Most professions expect you know and remember what to do.\n\nOn the other hand, there are many more times we need to use pieces of information for only a while \u2013 we don\u2019t need to remember them but they help us to learn at the time: details of an event, how to cook a recipe or finding out the breadth of changes in a recent government policy change.\n\nToday\u2019s school curriculum focuses on 21st century skills which are about processes of applying information, problem solving and collaborating.\n\nA key skill in our current era is the ability to draw on lots of different types of information and bring them together to work out a solution, to gain a new perspective on a situation or to develop our knowledge of something.\n\nRelated: Who Controls the Digital Data of the Deceased?\n\nIs it important to remember all the research you did for your trip to Hawaii? Probably not. As long as you can access, organise and use the information while you\u2019re there is what most people would need.\n\nWe also all have different learning styles. The availability of a range of platforms to create information and from which we can access information is important for all. Handwriting and reading text doesn\u2019t necessarily suit everyone.\n\nDeep Thought\n\nIf remembering and understanding are linked to deliberate action then editing some footage or composing a script for a YouTube clip needs to be well thought through. It\u2019s not about if it was written on paper first but just that deep thought has been given to it.\n\nAlso if the argument for turning back to books is about not being distracted by online ads or checking our social media or email accounts, then it\u2019s important that we learn to work well in our e-society. Technology is not going away.\n\nThe shift away from pen on paper has been driven by:\n\nconvenience \u2013 our devices are always close by\n\ncost, as cloud-based content eliminates expensive printing costs\n\nthe thrill of the latest innovation\n\n\n\n\n\nThese are important factors and suggest screens will become an even greater part of our lives in the future.\n\nSome may suggest that we are losing opportunities to learn because of our love affair with our screens, but our era today is about understanding and managing information and then developing knowledge from that. A turn back to focusing on remembering information is simply not important now.\n\nThis article was originally published on The Conversation.
