That includes I.U.D.s and implants. The society said these methods are best for teens who may have difficulty adhering to a routine such as never missing a birth control pill or always using condoms. (Failure rates for I.U.D.s are 0.8 percent; implants, 0.05 percent; birth control pills, 9 percent; condoms, 18 percent.)\n\nThe Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services issued a directive in August calling for all clinics that accept Medicaid to offer counseling on a complete range of FDA-approved contraception.\n\nBut despite these recommendations and regulations, access for Peoria females can be limited.\n\nTwo clinics operated by Heartland Community Health Clinic on Armstrong and Garden do not offer contraceptive counseling and refer patients to their other clinics, some of which have restricted hours for these services, said Mary Auer, clinical director at Heartland.\n\nHowever, Auer said this is not a barrier to women.\n\n\u201cWe rent from OSF and we go by their rules. This is not a (limiting) factor at all that we can\u2019t do this at all locations,\u201d she said.\n\nHeartland employees do not insert I.U.D.s or implants. Auer said some of the organization\u2019s primary care physicians choose not to receive training in these procedures, but OSF residents in obstetrics and gynecology have received training and work a half day a week at the Heartland clinic on Wisconsin, Auer said. Other Heartland clinics have health care professionals providing these family planning services.\n\nA full-range of FDA-approved contraception for patients on Medicaid is available at UnityPoint Health-Methodist Family Clinic on Main Street and UnityPoint-Health Clinic on Allen Road.\n\nAlthough the Affordable Care Act covers contraception without cost to patients, it is often difficult for patients to find a provider.\n\nDr. Amanda Wright, practicing at the UnityPoint clinic on Allen Road, said the best way to help girls avoid unwanted pregnancy is to start talking with patients early as part of regular primary care.\n\n\u201cThis discussion is natural with a family physician. It\u2019s another part of keeping yourself safe,\u201d she said. \u201cThis discussion is part of health care. It\u2019s not morality.\u201d\n\nWright puts in I.U.D.s and said residents at UnityPoint Health-Methodist are trained in this procedure.\n\nDr. Sarah Ramirez, women\u2019s health fellow, UnityPoint Health-Methodist Family Clinic on Main Street, said, \u201cThe beauty of seeing a family doctor is we see the whole family. We have a relationship with the family, and we can help the family navigate these conversations. We routinely start these conversations.\n\n\u201cWhen our patients hear or read something, it\u2019s nice when they come to us with questions. That\u2019s part of comprehensive family care.\u201d\n\nRamirez said adolescents are one of the hardest groups to talk with and no topic should be out of bounds.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s not an honest conversation, it will push them away,\u201d she said.\n\nBoth Wright and Ramirez expressed hope Peoria School District 150 will begin teaching comprehensive sex education including evidence-based information on contraception.\n\nLegislation passed by both houses of the state Legislature and signed into law in 2013 by Gov. Pat Quinn mandates that school districts teaching sex education must include evidence-based instruction in contraception in addition to abstinence. Peoria District 150 has historically taught an abstinence-based curriculum that has been documented to be ineffective. Some comprehensive instruction has been available in the schools by personnel provided by outside agencies.\n\nThe new law went into effect January 2014. District 150 expects to have a curriculum in place by September 2015 starting with sixth grade, said Maureen Langholf, director of special education who oversees health services.\n\nThe school district is partnering with the Peoria City/County Health Department, Hult Health Center and other social service agencies in Peoria to develop the curriculum.\n\nAccording to Langholf, the new curriculum will cover decision-making, access to health resources, discussion of safe touching, HIV, reproduction, pregnancy and birth.\n\n\u201cWe do have to teach abstinence . . . the importance of abstinence and the risks of contraception,\u201d Langholf said.\n\nAsked about missing the Janaury 2014 deadline, she said, \u201cWe can\u2019t just throw this together\u201d and partnering with other agencies in the community requires time, as does obtaining School Board approval for the curriculum.\n\nMonica Hendrickson, epidemiologist at Peoria City/County Health Department, said teen pregnancy and sexually transmitted infection rates are not \u201coutbreaks\u201d but are \u201cendemic in our community\u201d due in part to separating these issues from health care and making them moral issues.\n\n\u201cTeen births in the United States are comparable to Third World countries . . . countries without public education systems,\u201d Hendrickson said. \u201cTo see change, the community as a whole needs to talk about these rates as health issues.\u201d\n\nShe said school children study religions of the world, and parents don\u2019t have the right to opt out of these classes for fear their children will be converted. She views comprehensive sex education similarly and said if sex ed is viewed as health wellness, there is no need for parents to opt out for their children.\n\n\u201cAs a community, we cannot allow information not to be available,\u201d she said.\n\nAlthough Heartland does not provide a full range of contraceptive services at all clinics during all hours, Auer said Heartland does not refer patients to Planned Parenthood.\n\nPlanned Parenthood Illinois president Carole Brite said her organization is aware of the situation in Peoria and operates extended hours at its clinic at 705 NE Jefferson St.\n\n\u201cWe want to make sure we provide the most access we can,\u201d she said, noting that the Peoria clinic provides contraceptive counseling to about 4,000 women a year and the numbers are increasing.\n\n\u201cThe Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services requires every clinic that accepts Medicaid to provide patients with every FDA- approved form of contraception. This is a directive,\u201d Brite said, confirming that Planned Parenthood clinics comply with this regulation.\n\nDr. John Carroll, a Peoria physician who founded the charity Haitian Hearts, has labeled the issue concerning Heartland contraception \u201cdishonest and disingenuous.\u201d\n\nCarroll said as a Catholic he is personally opposed to contraception but was disappointed when the Peoria bishop railed against President Barack Obama and the Affordable Care Act concerning the contraception mandate after OSF has followed a practice for over 20 years allowing its doctors to write prescriptions for contraceptives by temporarily waiving their status as OSF employees during the moments they write on their private prescription pads.\n\nCarroll sees this as a market-driven exception to Catholic dogma.\n\nJoseph Piccione, the hospital ethicist attributed with devising the plan, did not respond to a request for an interview.\n\nCarroll, who advocates for health care for poor Haitians, called it \u201cironic\u201d that at locations owned by OSF, Heartland is restricted from dispensing contraceptives to poor women but physicians at the hospital can provide contraceptives to women covered by insurance.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The  Community Word", "description": "Contraceptives are accessible to some Peoria women, not all Teen-aged girls in some areas of Peoria have more than twice the pregnancy rate as their counterparts nationwide but limited access to lo...", "title": "Contraceptive counseling by zip code", "url": "http://thecommunityword.com/online/blog/2014/12/29/contraceptive-counseling-by-zip-code/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://thecommunityword.com/online/files/2014/12/Ramirezbw_6in.jpg", "height": 831}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-29T18:01:41+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-28T19:48:19+00:00"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://thecommunityword.com/online/files/2014/12/Ramirezbw_6in.jpg?w=640", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.3"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddee1\"", "article_summary": "Other Heartland clinics have health care professionals providing these family planning services.\nBoth Wright and Ramirez expressed hope Peoria School District 150 will begin teaching comprehensive sex education including evidence-based information on contraception.\n\u201cPart of the problem is it\u2019s difficult to obtain contraceptive counseling in Peoria .\n\u201cThis discussion is part of health care.\nTwo clinics operated by Heartland Community Health Clinic on Armstrong and Garden do not offer contraceptive counseling and refer patients to their other clinics, some of which have restricted hours for these services, said Mary Auer, clinical director at Heartland."}
