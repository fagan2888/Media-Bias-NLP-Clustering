Sometimes, we turn to coats and scarves for help. But humans may soon borrow certain \u201cantifreeze\u201d qualities from reptiles and insects in order to better protect themselves when the temperature drops, according to a new study published in PLOS ONE.\n\nThe study aimed to analyze how certain species among plants, fish, insects, amphibians, and reptiles use antifreeze proteins to create \u201ccold hardiness\u201d during the winter. These species are examples of ectotherms, or organisms that aren\u2019t capable of moderating their own body temperatures. Instead, they rely on external heat sources to stay warm. Both ticks and fish have antifreeze proteins that protect them from getting frozen tissues during winter months.\n\nTicks in particular are Erol Fikrig's, a professor of medicine at Yale and the lead author of the new study, main focus. They have a protein called IAFGP that is triggered during winter months, which protects them from the cold. Fikrig and his team bred special mice that contained the spliced genes responsible for antifreeze properties in ticks in order to see if mammals could derive similar protection from these proteins \u2014 especially since human's internal methods of temperature regulation (like body insulation and blood flow) only go so far.\n\nThrough skin sample tests, where the researchers placed skin cells in slightly above freezing temperatures for days, as well as tests on living mice (where their tails were placed in a cooling solution for 7 days), the team were able to test their bodies against cold. They found that the mice who contained the IAFGP protein showed higher resistance to frostbite; 60 percent of them had no frostbite on their tails compared to only 11 percent of the mice without IAFGP.\n\n\u201cAntifreeze proteins (AFPs) contribute to cold hardiness by reducing cold-induced damage in a non-colligative manner, binding directly to the surface of ice crystals,\u201d the authors explained. \u201cThis interaction inhibits the addition of water molecules to the developing ice lattice and impedes crystal growth. In turn, this prevents the formation of sharp ice needles that inflict tissue damage.\u201d In other words, these natural antifreeze proteins prevent ice from taking over the organisms\u2019 tissues during severe cold \u2014 and it\u2019s these qualities that allow such living things to persist in \u201cextreme niches\u201d of the earth, like arctic waters or glaciers.\n\nBut this is just a preliminary study, and it will be quite a while before researchers can even begin to test this in humans \u2014 mainly because they can\u2019t use the same method they used to inject the proteins into the mice. \u201cOur study doesn\u2019t address the question of how we\u2019d deliver the protein,\u201d Fikrig told The Washington Post. \u201cWe\u2019re using transgenic mice, and we\u2019re obviously not going to put this gene into people.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, as winter rasps out its last icy dying breaths, bundle up.\n\nSource: Heisig M, Mattessich S, Rembisz A, Acar A, Shapiro M, Booth C. \u201cFrostbite Protection in Mice Expressing an Antifreeze Glycoprotein.\u201d PLOS One, 2015.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "antifreeze, ticks, beating cold", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A new study tried to test whether antifreeze proteins found in certain reptiles and insects could help us stay warm during the cold months, too.", "title": "Fighting The Cold With The Antifreeze Proteins Of Ticks", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/how-using-antifreeze-proteins-ticks-may-protect-us-cold-323914", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/02/28/cold.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A new study tried to test whether antifreeze proteins found in certain reptiles and insects could help us stay warm during the cold months, too.", "title": "Fighting The Cold With The Antifreeze Proteins Of Ticks", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/how-using-antifreeze-proteins-ticks-may-protect-us-cold-323914", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/02/28/cold.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/02/28/cold.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Innovation", "published_time": "2015-02-28T13:49:43-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-28T13:49:42-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A new study tried to test whether antifreeze proteins found in certain reptiles and insects could help us stay warm during the cold months, too."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd5952\"", "article_summary": "Both ticks and fish have antifreeze proteins that protect them from getting frozen tissues during winter months.\nThe study aimed to analyze how certain species among plants, fish, insects, amphibians, and reptiles use antifreeze proteins to create \u201ccold hardiness\u201d during the winter.\n\u201cAntifreeze proteins (AFPs) contribute to cold hardiness by reducing cold-induced damage in a non-colligative manner, binding directly to the surface of ice crystals,\u201d the authors explained.\nWhen we get too cold, we suffer the risk of frostbite or hypothermia \u2014 but what if humans could borrow the antifreeze properties of certain organisms living in extreme cold?\nSource: Heisig M, Mattessich S, Rembisz A, Acar A, Shapiro M, Booth C. \u201cFrostbite Protection in Mice Expressing an Antifreeze Glycoprotein.\u201d PLOS One, 2015."}
