NEW YORK â€” Hoboken catcher Naomi Olacio is known for her clutch performances. Her solid play yesterday against Harlem helped guide her team to a 6-3 victory in the RBI Regional Tournament.

Olacio's first hit came in the form of a first inning double that scored Hoboken's first run of the game. She finished 2-for-5 with two RBIs.

"We fought really hard," Olacio said. "We had the lead but they started coming back. We didn't stop we didn't give up we just kept fighting."

Hoboken maintained a shutout and led 6-0 heading into the bottom of the seventh inning. Timely batting from Harlem coupled with a few wild pitches helped Harlem to get within three before Christina Mezey of St. Dominic induced a pop fly to end the game.

Mezey struck out seven batters in as many innings.

"We played a good team," coach Vinnie Johnson said. We left too many runners on base. You can't leave runners on and then expect this team to not come back."

Fortunately for Hoboken, they were able to shore up the shaky play and close to close out Harlem.

"We had to pick ourselves up," Olacio said. "The score was getting closer and closer but we just came back and started playing the game again and finished it out."

Hoboken is undefeated in pool play. They'll fight to stay perfect today at 11 a.m. against Boston at Harlem RBI Field of Dreams.

The plan for Hoboken is to play better defensively and capitalize when having base runners aboard.

"We have a decent team," Johnson said. "We gotta see what happens tomorrow."
