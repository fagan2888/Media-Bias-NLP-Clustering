The information comes from documents made public by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden.\n\nObama said he would not comment on details of NSA programs, but that while revelations of the agency's activities have raised legitimate concerns, some aspects have been exaggerated.\n\n\"Some of it has also been highly sensationalized and has been painted in a way that's not accurate,\" he said.\n\nSome surveillance is necessary to prevent terrorist attacks on U.S. soil, but the agency's activities are constrained in the United States, Obama said.\n\n\"They are not interested in reading your emails,\" he said. \"They're not interested in - reading your text messages.\" (Reporting by Mark Felsenthal; Editing by Mohammad Zargham)\n\nAlso on HuffPost: Politicians React To Obamacare Rollout Politicians React To Obamacare Rollout\n\n1 of 6 Michele Bachmann \"There\u2019s no sugarcoating it: Obamacare is forcing every American to purchase a health-insurance policy they don\u2019t want at a price they can\u2019t afford from a website that doesn\u2019t work.\" Share this slide:\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "WASHINGTON, Dec 5 (Reuters) - President Barack Obama said on  Thursday he intends to propose National Security Agency reforms  to reassure Americans ...", "sailthru.expire_date": "2013-12-06 19:03:00 -0500", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "WASHINGTON, Dec 5 (Reuters) - President Barack Obama said on  Thursday he intends to propose National Security Agency reforms  to reassure Americans ...", "title": "Obama Says NSA Isn't Interested In Reading Your Texts", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/12/05/obama-nsa-reform_n_4394842.html", "image": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1500239/images/o-BARACK-OBAMA-facebook.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@HuffPostPol", "image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1500239/images/o-BARACK-OBAMA-facebook.jpg", "height": 1000}, "description": "WASHINGTON, Dec 5 (Reuters) - President Barack Obama said on  Thursday he intends to propose National Security Agency reforms  to reassure Americans ...", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Obama Says NSA Isn't Interested In Reading Your Texts"}, "sailthru.date": "2013-12-05 19:03:00 -0500", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=4394842", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "nsa,video,nsa surveillance,reuters,obama nsa reform,National Security Agency,obama,Barack Obama,Chris Matthews", "article": {"section": "Politics", "tag": "nsa,video,nsa surveillance,reuters,obama nsa reform,National Security Agency,obama,Barack Obama,Chris Matthews", "published_time": "2013-12-05 19:03:00 -0500", "modified_time": "2014-02-04 05:59:02 -0500"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "article_summary": "WASHINGTON, Dec 5 (Reuters) - President Barack Obama said on Thursday he intends to propose National Security Agency reforms to reassure Americans that their privacy is not being violated by the agency.\nObama said he would not comment on details of NSA programs, but that while revelations of the agency's activities have raised legitimate concerns, some aspects have been exaggerated.\nSome surveillance is necessary to prevent terrorist attacks on U.S. soil, but the agency's activities are constrained in the United States, Obama said.\n\"Some of it has also been highly sensationalized and has been painted in a way that's not accurate,\" he said.\nThe information comes from documents made public by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden."}
