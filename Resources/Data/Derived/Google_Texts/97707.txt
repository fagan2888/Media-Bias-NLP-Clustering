To make Obamacare work, the government needs to persuade millions of young and healthy people to buy insurance. Nicknamed the "young invincibles," this group is critical to the equation because they would help subsidize the cost of insuring older and sicker people.

Those who resist will have to pay a penalty of $95, or 1 percent of their annual income -- whichever is greater. By 2016, the penalty will grow to $695, or 2.5 percent of income.

But to Steve Caracappa, of San Jose, the penalties are less painful than spending $138 for a monthly premium, the cheapest rate he could find on California's new health insurance exchange. That would represent 5ï»¿1/2 percent of his monthly take-home pay.

He's not alone. Nationwide, one study says, 3.7 million of those ages 18 to 34 will spend $500 less if they forgo insurance and pay the penalty during the first year of the new exchanges.

"Obamacare was supposed to make affordable health care available for everybody," said Caracappa, a 26-year-old community manager for a social-media website. But when he checked out the lowest prices available to him on the Covered California insurance exchange, he said there was "no way" he could keep up with his finances and pay for health insurance, too.

The cheapest Bronze plan is $138 a month, but has a $5,000 deductible. The cheapest Enhanced Silver plan costs $206 a month, with a $2,000 deductible.

Both are pretty rich for Caracappa's blood.

"Currently, my medical bills are zero," he said. "I don't go to the doctor, and I have not gone to the doctor in years. I can't even remember the last time I went."

When he needs minor medical care, he heads to an urgent care center, which he said is cheaper than paying a monthly premium.

''I hope it helps people," Caracappa said of the new law. "But, unfortunately, I don't think it's for me."
