(Photo: File/AP)\n\nEDITOR: I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve noticed all the signs posted around town encouraging us to vote on Feb. 16. I\u2019d like to call your attention to one sign in particular \u2014 the sign for the candidate with the long last name, Judge JoAnne Kloppenburg, running for Wisconsin Supreme Court.\n\nIn December I attended an event here in Stevens Point and met Kloppenburg. I was quite impressed with her background, experience, and expertise. Kloppenburg has a long, impressive record of serving the citizens of Wisconsin, first for 23 years as assistant attorney general for the Wisconsin Department of Justice and, for the past five years, as presiding judge in Wisconsin Court of Appeals District 4.\n\nIf you want to know more about her, you can visit her website at kloppenburgforjustice.com. There you can \u201cmeet\u201d this soft-spoken, clear thinking, nonpartisan candidate by viewing a short, one-minute video where she introduces herself.\n\nCharlene Figge,\n\nStevens Point\n\nTo submit a letter to the editor, visit: http://static.stevenspointjournal.com/submit-letter\n\nRead or Share this story: http://spjour.nl/1RNYwWr", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Vote for JoAnne Kloppenburg in Feb. 16 primary.", "og": {"site_name": "Stevens Point Journal Media", "description": "Vote for JoAnne Kloppenburg in Feb. 16 primary.", "title": "Read the signs, vote Kloppenburg", "url": "http://www.stevenspointjournal.com/story/opinion/readers/2016/01/27/read-signs-vote-kloppenburg/79410294/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/stevenspointjournal.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Vote for JoAnne Kloppenburg in Feb. 16 primary.", "creator": "@StevensPointJRL", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/61c1dd4a3b4755affd0bcc61b6e6cd3aff3a1aa8/c=709-0-2727-2018&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/01/27/StevensPoint/B9320666318Z.1_20160127134446_000_G5KD96DHA.1-0.jpg", "title": "Read the signs, vote Kloppenburg", "site": "@StevensPointJRL", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=884242174", "fb": {"app_id": 116784471723374}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "article_summary": "Wisconsin State Appeals Court Judge JoAnne Kloppenburg during her last Supreme Court campaign.\n(Photo: File/AP)EDITOR: I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve noticed all the signs posted around town encouraging us to vote on Feb. 16.\nI\u2019d like to call your attention to one sign in particular \u2014 the sign for the candidate with the long last name, Judge JoAnne Kloppenburg, running for Wisconsin Supreme Court.\nIn December I attended an event here in Stevens Point and met Kloppenburg.\nThere you can \u201cmeet\u201d this soft-spoken, clear thinking, nonpartisan candidate by viewing a short, one-minute video where she introduces herself."}
