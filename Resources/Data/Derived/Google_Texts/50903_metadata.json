Many victims and rescue workers began suffering from respiratory problems and various forms of cancer after breathing in toxic substances near Ground Zero.\n\nThe fund was originally expected to deal with roughly 34,000 claims, but it has approved just 10,549 so far.\n\nMany victims are only now coming forward with health claims, which could exhaust the fund in future years, said Michael Barasch, managing partner of New York-based Barasch McGarry Salzman & Penson, which represents roughly 1,000 Sept. 11 first responders and workers with cancer diagnoses.\n\n\u201cWe could hit 20,000 claims and there won\u2019t be enough money for everyone,\u201d Mr. Barasch said. \u201cI get calls every week from people, mostly young men, saying their asthma has turned into lung cancer.\u201d\n\nAs of March 31, 7,225 eligible claimaints had filed for compensation with the Sept. 11 Victim Compensation Fund, officials say. First responders account for 92% of the total amount that has been distributed. Other compensated victims include those who worked at Ground Zero, including those who performed maintenance and cleaning work.\n\nThose with cancer diagnoses account for 27% of the total compensation amount.\n\nThe awards are calculated based on economic loss, pain and suffering, minus other payments such as pensions or disability payments for injuries.\n\nThe minimum compensation is $10,000. The largest compensation amount was for $4.1 million, with an average compensation amount at more than $241,000.\n\nThere are nearly 7,000 claims for eligibility that haven\u2019t been decided yet because of incomplete paperwork or eligibility questions. The deadline to file a claim is Oct. 3, 2016. More than 65,000 people have registered for the program, although the vast majority have yet to file a claim.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "A congressional fund to compensate those who developed health problems after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks has agreed to dole out more than $1 billion so far, officials said Wednesday.", "title": "Fund to Give More Than $1 Billion to Ailing Sept. 11 Workers", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2015/04/08/federal-fund-compensates-sept-11th-terror-attack-sick-more-than-1-billion/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/img/WSJ_profile_lg.gif"}, "site": "WSJNY", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "New York", "article.headline": "Fund to Give More Than $1 Billion to Ailing Sept. 11 Workers", "description": "A congressional fund to compensate those who developed health problems after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks has agreed to dole out more than $1 billion so far, officials said Wednesday.", "article_section": "New York", "author": "Derek Kravitz", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Metropolis Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Metropolis", "article.summary": "A congressional fund to compensate those who developed health problems after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks has agreed to dole out more than $1 billion so far, officials said Wednesday.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2015-04-08T21:08:02-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-140", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2015/04/08/federal-fund-compensates-sept-11th-terror-attack-sick-more-than-1-billion/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-METROB-22867", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "New York", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "A congressional fund to compensate those who developed health problems after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks has agreed to dole out more than $1 billion so far, officials said Wednesday.", "title": "Fund to Give More Than $1 Billion to Ailing Sept. 11 Workers", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2015/04/08/federal-fund-compensates-sept-11th-terror-attack-sick-more-than-1-billion/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/blogs/img/WSJ_Logo_BlackBackground_1200x630social", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Metropolis", "article.id": "BL-METROB-22867", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2015-04-09T01:12:25-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd6ef\"", "article_summary": "A congressional fund to compensate those who developed health problems after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks has agreed to dole out more than $1 billion so far, officials said Wednesday.\n\u201cI get calls every week from people, mostly young men, saying their asthma has turned into lung cancer.\u201dAs of March 31, 7,225 eligible claimaints had filed for compensation with the Sept. 11 Victim Compensation Fund, officials say.\nMany victims and rescue workers began suffering from respiratory problems and various forms of cancer after breathing in toxic substances near Ground Zero.\nThe fund was originally expected to deal with roughly 34,000 claims, but it has approved just 10,549 so far.\nMany victims are only now coming forward with health claims, which could exhaust the fund in future years, said Michael Barasch, managing partner of New York-based Barasch McGarry Salzman & Penson, which represents roughly 1,000 Sept. 11 first responders and workers with cancer diagnoses."}
