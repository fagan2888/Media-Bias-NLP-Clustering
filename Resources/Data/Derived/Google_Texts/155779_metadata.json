This part isn\u2019t a surprise\u2014the two-day event was organized by Americans for Prosperity, the Koch-funded political advocacy group that wields considerable power and influence. What was surprising was the most interesting speaker isn\u2019t running for office. Rather, he\u2019s mostly concerned about how someone runs a bar. His name is Jon Taffer, host of the popular series Bar Rescue on Spike.\n\nOn the show, Taffer takes on struggling bars and bar owners and almost literally whips them into shape. The native New Yorker has decades of experience in the hospitality industry\u2014but it\u2019s his drill sergeant persona that grabs one\u2019s attention, translating into ever higher television ratings. (Take, for instance, his confrontation with a kitchen staffer who handles raw chicken and cooked food without washing her hands.)\n\nOn stage in Columbus, Taffer was just as furious\u2014but this time because of the plight of small business: \u201cFortunes lost, family security lost, and their American dream destroyed by a politically charged, economic environment that again destroyed\u2014not cultivated\u2014their American dream. How about this? Approximately 600,000 small businesses open every year, 720,000 close! We\u2019re bleeding to death!\u201d He paces angrily. \u201cLet\u2019s face it, regulations are being implemented by law and executive order that can only be chosen with a complete disregard for small business, right?!\u201d (Most of the audience applauds, but I can\u2019t help wonder if some were trembling in fear. Having met with Taffer in the past, I'd add that aside from his booming voice and towering stature, there\u2019s also the matter of his bulging eyes piercing your soul.)\n\nIn a phone interview earlier this week, Taffer sounded much more calm. And he seemed pleased by his performance at the summit, his first ever political event. \u201cIt felt fantastic,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know, honestly, I feel like I have a message.\u201d And he insists that the message was meant to be about policy, not politics. \u201cI put together a speech that I believe I could have given at a conservative or liberal, Democrat or Republican event.\u201d\n\nExcept I\u2019m not quite sure how Democrats would have responded to the health care segment of his speech: \u201cWith Obamacare, small business owners are forced to weigh the benefits of growing their business with the increased cost of mandated health care\u2026. Legislation that is passed in the dark of the night causes concern from the get-go, doesn\u2019t it? When our legislative leaders say, \u2018You\u2019ll see what\u2019s in it when we pass it,\u2019 that caused pause, didn\u2019t it? That caused fear, didn\u2019t it? The rumors flew! The fear of elevated cost grew\u2014the cost did go up! And the failures of the White House PR team was monumental! Lightweight! They totally blew it!\u201d\n\nPlus he\u2019s no Hillary Clinton fan. On Your World with Neil Cavuto and Varney & Co., Taffer said the Democratic candidate faces \"a serious credibility issue\" and \"I'm not sure she's electable.\" On the phone, he went further, calling her \"Nixonian.\" And although he says he isn\u2019t sure if he could ever vote for Donald Trump, he sees the attraction. \u201cI \u2026 think the fact that he doesn\u2019t owe anybody anything is very appealing to America,\u201d whereas \u201cwhen I look at Bush donations, I get terrified when I read that 50 percent of his donations are coming from people who donated to his father and his brother. So these are three generations of favors this guy owes. That scares me as much as I like him.\u201d\n\nA common criticism about Donald Trump\u2019s candidacy has been a lack of specific policy remedies. So I ask Taffer if he has a solution in mind\u2014any solution\u2014with regard to what ails small business.\n\nHow about if we turned our back on small business taxes, created federal enterprise zones, if you will, and created a moratorium on small business taxes for businesses that do under $2 million a year, are truly owned by individuals\u2014not corporations\u2014have under 50 employees, and they\u2019re going to be built in a downtown or economically hungry area that if we set not partial\u2014not 80 percent\u2014but a complete tax moratorium on those entities for one, two, or three years, what would that do to small-town America? Suddenly rather than people saying, \u201cI\u2019m going to wait another year and see what shakes out with Obamacare\u201d and everything, they would say, \u201cWe should start our business now and take advantage of the full tax opportunity.\u201d We would have businesses opening in months.\n\nTaffer admits \u201cI\u2019m being aggressive,\u201d but points to his experience in the restaurant industry. \u201cIf I do two-for-one cocktails or a moderate, or a slightly incentivized offer, I\u2019ll get 10 people to come. But if I give away free chicken wings all afternoon, they\u2019ll line up around the block. We need to be bold!\u201d\n\nBut why make any Trump comparison? Jon Taffer isn\u2019t running for president, is he? \u201cNo,\u201d he flat out states, although \u201cif a candidate puts together a small business platform, I\u2019ll go out on the road for him. You know, I\u2019ll support him. I\u2019ve got a good millennial base that I think can bring some votes, but I\u2019ve got to believe in their platform because of small business.\u201d\n\nStill, Taffer lingers on the thought: \u201cBetween you and me, I think I can do a far better job than the people in the White House who do it. You know, I\u2019d be more inclusive. I\u2019d get in the car, I\u2019d drive to Capitol Hill, I\u2019d walk up those stairs.\u2026 That\u2019s the kind of president I think we need\u2026. I\u2019d say, \u2018I\u2019m not leaving until we fix something.\u2019\u201d (It should also be noted that Taffer\u2019s major at the University of Denver was political science.)\n\nBut no, the host of Bar Rescue says he is perfectly content running his multiple business ventures and doing 20 more episodes for the network. \u201cAs long as people keep wanting to watch for me, honestly, the hug at the end [of each episode] means more to me than the check. And that\u2019s where I\u2019m at with it. And as long as I can keep getting that hug and helping people and saving jobs, it\u2019s really hard to stop doing it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Victorino Matus", "og": {"site_name": "Weekly Standard", "description": "Last weekend\u2019s Defending the American Dream Summit in Columbus played host to five presidential candidates: Jeb Bush, Ted Cruz, Bobby Jindal, Rick Perry, and Marco Rubio.
