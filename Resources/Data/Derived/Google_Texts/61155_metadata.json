Brothers bedding sisters. Whore-loving dwarves. \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d has explored every permutation of romance. Why not a chaste one? It strikes a sort of poetic balance that on the same night that \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d fans lost their beloved bi-furious champion Oberyn Martell \u2014 as renowned for his boundless libido as his warrior skills \u2014 we would see a genuine spark of mutual, but as-yet-unfulfilled, longing between the unassuming translator Missandei (Nathalie Emmanuel) and the eunuch Grey Worm (Jacob Anderson). But does the show have the balls to follow through and allow pure love to bloom between these two? Twitter fans hope so.\n\nBest scene at @GameOfThrones ep.8 (against popular belief) #missandei #GreyWorm the couple @tim_kiki and I been shipping for! Give us more.. \u2014 MariaManol (@maria_manol) June 2, 2014\n\nThis love affair between #GreyWorm and #Missandei is EXACTLY what this season needed. It's pure, innocent, and bitter sweet @GameOfThrones \u2014 Kristolyn Lloyd (@KristolynLloyd) June 2, 2014\n\nSo the ending was cray but how cute are #missandei and #greyworm #heartThem #GameOfThrones \u2014 Cassie Estrella-Roca (@divastyle99) June 2, 2014\n\nWhile it seems a forgone conclusion that the Khaleesi\u2019s two most dedicated disciples will inevitably hook up, as far as I am concerned, the uniqueness of their connection ultimately relies on its logistics. At one point in the episode, Daenarys asks Missandei whether or not the \u201cpillars\u201d and \u201cthe stones\u201d were removed when Grey Worm was indoctrinated into the Unsullied warrior class. Neither woman knew for certain \u2014 which leaves open the possibility that Grey Worm still bears enough equipment to seal the deal in the traditional sense.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Alongside the fight scene in last night's explosive episode, there was also a less bloody pairing", "author": "Neil Drumming", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Alongside the fight scene in last night's explosive episode, there was also a less bloody pairing", "title": "\u201cGame of Thrones\u201d recap: Unconsummated love", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/06/02/game_of_thrones_recap_unconsummated_love/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/game_of_thrones11.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Alongside the fight scene in last night's explosive episode, there was also a less bloody pairing", "creator": "@Neil_Salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/game_of_thrones11.jpg", "title": "\u201cGame of Thrones\u201d recap: Unconsummated love", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "\u201cGame of Thrones\u201d recap: Unconsummated love", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, eunuch, Game of Thrones, grey worm, Missandei, oberyn, TV", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcf47\"", "article_summary": "Topics: eunuch, Game of Thrones, grey worm, Missandei, oberyn, TV, Entertainment NewsLords cavorting with witches.\nNeither woman knew for certain \u2014 which leaves open the possibility that Grey Worm still bears enough equipment to seal the deal in the traditional sense.\nBest scene at @GameOfThrones ep.8 (against popular belief) #missandei #GreyWorm the couple @tim_kiki and I been shipping for!\nGive us more.. \u2014 MariaManol (@maria_manol) June 2, 2014This love affair between #GreyWorm and #Missandei is EXACTLY what this season needed.\n\u201cGame of Thrones\u201d has explored every permutation of romance."}
