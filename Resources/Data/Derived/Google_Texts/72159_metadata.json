The Colorado attorney general\u2019s Justice Review Project took up Dewey\u2019s case in 2011, and DNA tests with improved technology cleared him.\n\nDewey was released in in April 2012, when he was 51, but has been living in poverty. His ordeal attracted the attention of state lawmakers, and after hearing emotional testimony from Dewey, they passed a bill this year authorizing compensation in cases like his. Gov. John Hickenlooper signed it into law.\n\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m (angry),\u201d Dewey told lawmakers at a hearing in March. \u201cBut what good is that going to do?\u201d\n\nDewey is believed to be the first person to be compensated under the act.\n\nThe Attorney General\u2019s Office and the district attorney for Mesa County, where Dewey was convicted, proposed the award last month. A formula outlined by the law allows for compensation of up to $70,000 for each year served in prison, with payments capped at $100,000 a year.\n\nThe attorney general and the DA have denied wrongdoing or misconduct by investigators and prosecutors.\n\nAuthorities said the DNA tests that exonerated Dewey implicated another man, Douglas Thames, who is serving a life sentence for an unrelated slaying.\n\nProsecutors charged Thames with murder in Taylor\u2019s death. He has pleaded not guilty.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nInformation from: The Daily Sentinel, http://www.gjsentinel.com", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Man wrongfully imprisoned 17 years awarded $1.2M", "title": "Man wrongfully imprisoned 17 years awarded $1.2M", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/09/04/man-wrongfully-imprisoned-17-years-awarded-1-2m/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130308_015544_dewey.jpg", "height": 400}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130308_015544_dewey.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2013-09-04T08:45:21+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T11:30:40+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf218\"", "article_summary": "The Colorado attorney general\u2019s Justice Review Project took up Dewey\u2019s case in 2011, and DNA tests with improved technology cleared him.\nRobert Dewey will be paid $100,000 a year for 17 years, minus taxes, the Grand Junction Daily Sentinel reported Wednesday ( http://tinyurl.com/kbucpg6).\nA judge signed an order Aug. 28 authorizing compensation for Dewey after finding he was innocent.\nAuthorities said the DNA tests that exonerated Dewey implicated another man, Douglas Thames, who is serving a life sentence for an unrelated slaying.\nThe Attorney General\u2019s Office and the district attorney for Mesa County, where Dewey was convicted, proposed the award last month."}
