Since its inception, Joni and Friends has been dedicated to extending the love and message of Christ to people who are affected by disability whether it is the disabled person, a family member, or friend. Our objective is to meet the physical, emotional, and spiritual needs of this group of people in practical ways.\n\nCommentary by Doug Mazza, President and COO of Joni and Friends International Disability Center and is the co-author of \u201cAnother Kind of Courage: God\u2019s Design for Fathers of Families Affected by Disability.\u201d\n\n\u2013\n\nThe question \u201cWhen does life begin?\u201d has been at the center of the abortion issue since the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s Roe vs. Wade decision was announced in 1973.\n\nFor the sake of finding common ground, let\u2019s go beyond birth and agree that a living, breathing child asleep in a crib is to be considered both \u201cborn\u201d and \u201clife\u201d protected by the laws of the land. It is reasonable therefore to conclude that anyone who willfully and purposefully ends that life would be committing a murder.\n\nNot so, according to Princeton ethics (yes, ethics!) professor Peter Singer who was recently interviewed on New York radio (AM 970) defending his 1993 treatise \u201cTaking Life: Humans\u201d \u2013 in it, he promotes infanticide for severely disabled children.\n\nSinger argues that the health-care system under Obamacare should openly acknowledge health-care rationing and that the country should acknowledge the necessity of \u201cintentionally ending the lives of severely disabled infants.\u201d Singer calls it a nice, antiseptic, \u201cnon-voluntary euthanasia.\u201d\n\nI am the parent of one of Singer\u2019s potential victims. My son, Ryan, is blind, severely developmentally disabled, doesn\u2019t speak, and is fed through a tube. Exactly the person Singer is hunting and targeting for \u201cinvoluntary euthanasia.\u201d In Singer\u2019s world my consent would not be needed. Ryan would be \u201cnon-voluntarily\u201d euthanized. So my son would be, more accurately, found guilty of having a severe disability and executed by the state.\n\nMy disabled son has brought more significance to the work of my life than any other source. Share:\n\nBut there\u2019s more to this story than a technical, mechanistic elimination of a disabled child.\n\nWithout Ryan, I would not have found my purpose in life. Ryan, whom I mistakenly viewed as a tragedy when he was born, ultimately taught me the meaning of compassion, perseverance, kindness, and more. As I\u2019ve shared how Ryan\u2019s life transformed my own, my boy has inspired thousands across the country and throughout the world. I wouldn\u2019t have missed out on knowing him for anything.\n\nI would never have chosen to serve as President of the Joni and Friends International Disability Center were it not for his inspiring example. The lives of thousands of other special-needs families are changing through my partnership with Ryan. He has brought more significance to the work of my life than any other source.\n\nRyan will never pursue a degree, land a job, raise a family, pay taxes, or hold office. Yet his life demonstrates consummate purpose. His perseverance inspires me and countless others to press on, persevere, and never give up, no matter how intimidating the challenge. His will to live has birthed in me a voracious desire to not waste one precious day. His unfiltered expressions of joy drive me to serve others in a way I never could have realized on my own.\n\nRyan may deserve death in Singer\u2019s mind. He\u2019s got a chart to prove it. Yet last year, when Joni and Friends delivered its 100,000th wheelchair to a severely disabled child in Africa, everyone agreed that Ryan was an important impetus. Maybe he didn\u2019t personally deliver those 100,000 chairs, but because of him many have found their suffering eased and their abilities expanded and a bountiful harvest of joy would have been missed.\n\nAnd Dr. Singer, that same chart that would ensure his death, inspires more life and love than you could possibly imagine. And I\u2019ve got my own chart to prove it!\n\n\u2013\n\nTheBlaze contributor channel supports an open discourse on a range of views.
