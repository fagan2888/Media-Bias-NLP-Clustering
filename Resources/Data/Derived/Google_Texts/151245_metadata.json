One in seven is unsure where their next meal will come from and 1.6 million kids were forced to live in emergency shelters.\n\nIn his first State of the Union address 50 years ago, Lyndon B. Johnson called on Congress to declare war against this plight.\n\n\n\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsor\n\n\u201cLet this session of Congress be known as the session which did more for civil rights than the last hundred sessions combined; as the session which enacted the most far-reaching tax cut of our time; as the session which declared all-out war on human poverty and unemployment in these United States; as the session which finally recognized the health needs of all our older citizens; as the session which reformed our tangled transportation and transit policies; as the session which achieved the most effective, efficient foreign aid program ever; and as the session which helped to build more homes, more schools, more libraries, and more hospitals than any single session of Congress in the history of our Republic,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nAt the time that Johnson gave this speech, the national poverty level was at 19 percent. Despite Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s \u201cNew Deal,\u201d the nation has never had a federal relief program that assisted non-elderly, non-disabled poor people. Prior to Johnson\u2019s \u201ccall to war,\u201d assistance for the needy was relegated to the states \u2014 which had a very non-universal approach toward administering aid \u2014 and to private organizations.\n\nJohnson\u2019s \u201cWar on Poverty\u201d led to the passage of the Economic Opportunity Act, the first legislative representation of Roosevelt\u2019s Four Freedoms of 1941, or guarantees Roosevelt argued that people \u201ceverywhere in the world\u201d should be able to enjoy \u2014 the freedom of speech, the freedom of worship, the freedom from want and the freedom from fear.\n\nIn his 1941 State of the Union address, Roosevelt argued that the benefits of democracy include economic opportunity, employment, social security and the promise of \u201cadequate health care.\u201d\n\nEarlier this month, Republican Rep. Paul Ryan told NBC Nightly News\u2019 Brian Williams that the \u201cWar on Poverty\u201d has failed, decrying that \u201ctrillions of dollars\u201d have been spent on federal social spending while 46.5 million Americans remain under the poverty line.\n\n\u201cWe can do better than this,\u201d he said, calling on a return to community-based relief. \u201cToo many people don\u2019t know what the American idea is anymore.\u201d\n\nIn order to properly interpret Ryan\u2019s assertion, one must actually look at what it means to be impoverished in America and what has been the national response.\n\nA history of social spending\n\nJohnson\u2019s \u201cGreat Society\u201d \u2014 as the net effect of his sponsored legislation became known as \u2014 led to\n\nthe Social Security Act of 1965, which created Medicare and Medicaid\n\nthe Food Stamp Act of 1964, which created the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program, the School Lunch Program and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for women, infants, and children\n\nthe Economic Opportunity Act of 1964, which created the Community Action Program, Job Corps, Volunteers in Service to America, the collegiate Work Study program, Adult Basic Education and the Economic Opportunity Council\n\nthe Higher Education Act of 1965, which increased the amount of federal money given to American colleges and created the Pell Grant, the Federal Direct Student Loan Program, and the Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant Program\n\nthe Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, which has last been re-authorized as the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001.\n\nThe net sum of the effects of Johnson\u2019s legislation is undeniable: prior to the onset of the Great Recession, the national poverty rate was 13.2 percent \u2014 more than eight points lower than the rate in 1959, the first year the national poverty rate was measured, and more than five points lower than when Johnson declared war. In an ironic twist, it was this very success that led to the defeat of the \u201cWar on Poverty,\u201d as critics could point to the dropping poverty level and declare there was no problem at all.\n\nIn the whole of American history, there have been only four serious attempts made on the federal level to establish and strengthen the social safety net. Under Theodore Roosevelt, the \u201cSquare Deal\u201d \u2014 a set of health and public welfare reforms that included the establishment of the eight-hour workday for irrigation workers; the establishment of the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906, the Meat Inspection Act of 1906, the Federal Employers Liability Act of 1908 and the Federal Employee\u2019s Compensation Act of 1908; and reformed military pensions \u2014 was pressed into law.\n\nThese legislations, however, were seen as \u201cbusiness corrections;\u201d care for the poor and indigent were delegated to county-run poorhouses or poor farms, to privately-held foundations and trusts, personal and family efforts, workers\u2019 disability compensation and state-run programs in the wealthier states.\n\nFranklin Pierce\u2019s veto of the Bill for the Benefit of the Indigent Insane of 1854 \u2014 which would have permitted land grants to the states for the establishment of asylums for the indigent insane, as well as for the blind, deaf and dumb \u2014 created a precedent of federal non-intervention in social reform that was not overturned until Franklin D. Roosevelt 70 years later.\n\nIt was desperation, more than anything else, that forced Roosevelt\u2019s hand, in reality. The Great Depression created a situation that overwhelmed state and private capability to address. With astronomical levels of poverty and hunger facing the nation, the federal government first attempted to offer first loans and then grants to the states to shore up their social programs. The federal government also initiated a large number of public works program toward getting Americans working again. The Roosevelt administration authored and pushed through the Social Security Act of 1935 \u2014 which ensured the welfare of the elderly and the disabled \u2014 only after it grew convinced that the states will be incapable of acting on their own.\n\nAfter Johnson, the next president to address increasing social spending was Bill Clinton. Early into his presidency, then first lady Hillary Clinton proposed a single-payer healthcare system, which was universally and vehemently panned by Republicans. The suggestion was never seriously considered by the Congress. However, Bill Clinton is known as the president that signed into law the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act of 1996, which forced a work requirement for the receipt of federal relief funds. As Clinton claimed after signing the bill into law, it fulfilled his campaign promise to \u201cend welfare as we have come to know it.\u201d\n\nThe last significant social spending reform, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 \u2014 also known as the Affordable Care Act or \u201cObamacare\u201d \u2014 and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, sought to address concerns that have been plaguing the health care and education industries \u2014 namely, price-gouging for critical services and loans and a denial of equivalent service to all borrowers/customers. The laws ended the practice of private banks servicing federal insured loans, stopped insurers from denying coverage for pre-existing conditions or for demographic reasons, required the establishment of an affordable, publicly-available health care insurance option and established loan forgiveness after 20 years of timely payments.\n\nJohnson\u2019s impact\n\nHowever, Johnson\u2019s reforms were the largest and had the greatest impact. While social programming is responsible for 35 percent of the national gross domestic product, with 21 percent being pure public expenditures, per a 2009 Congressional Budget Office report, the expenditure of these monies keep more than 60 million Americans out of destitution.\n\nAccording to the report, the bottom quintile of American household by income have a total average household income of $7,500, less than half of the federal poverty line. The average federal transfer to these families \u2014 including the Earned Income Tax Credit, Medicaid, SNAP, Social Security and Supplemental Security Income \u2014 is $22,900, with Social Security and Medicare being overwhelmingly responsible for the increase.\n\nIn reality, almost all Americans \u2014 regardless of age, ethnicity, race or wealth \u2014 use a social program. It just happens to be that most do not realize that they are doing so.\n\nAccording to Suzanne Mettler\u2019s \u201cReconstructing the Submerged State: The Challenges of Social Policy Reform in the Obama Era,\u201d only 35 percent of all respondents knew that 529 or Coverdell saving plans are state-based educational prepayment programs authorized under section 529 of the Internal Revenue Code. Only 40 percent realized that their home mortgage interest deduction was backed under a special program under the auspice of the Internal Revenue Service. Only 40.4 percent knew that the Hope and Lifetime Learning Tax Credits were Clinton-era social programs.\n\nWhat made Johnson different from any other president is that Johnson had first-hand experience with poverty. Johnson\u2019s father was an once-successful businessman and politician who fell from grace. Impoverished by the rapid turn of fate, Johnson knew the humiliation and insecurity of hunger and poverty. Johnson hated poverty, and this single-mindedness created one of the most aggressive and frantic drives to undo what he saw as a denial of hope.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, many Americans live on the outskirts of hope \u2014 some because of their poverty, and some because of theft color, and all too many because of both,\u201d Johnson continued in his State of the Union address. \u201cOur task is to help replace their despair with opportunity.\u201d\n\nChallenging social reform\n\nIn Ryan\u2019s and in the responses to social spending from the Republicans, there is an apathy that is bred from an ignorance of the issues at hand. There has been a perception among the white middle class that social spending benefits minorities at the cost of increased taxes. Without seeing exactly how this benefited them, many in the white middle and upper classes lost sympathy for the effort, particularly, after the various economic declines. Eventually, it became fashionable to criticize social spending.\n\nIf Ryan\u2019s assertion was taken to be true and the \u201cWar on Poverty\u201d failed, it failed because of politicians like Ryan, who have been willing to sacrifice social spending for vote-friendly allocations, such as military increases. However, one must accept that without what have been done with the \u201cWar on Poverty,\u201d the national poverty rate would be in excess of 30 percent.\n\nBut this does not mean that social spending has been successful. The hard realization is that current social spending addresses short-term needs without effectively answering the long-term problem. For example, while it is important to feed the hungry now, without addressing why they cannot feed themselves, the nation will be forced to continue to feed these individuals indefinitely. Along with addressing short-term needs, there must be long-term investments in infrastructure reform, education, community development, skills training and social development.\n\nAn example of this is the current shortage of living-wage jobs for the minimally- or under-skilled. Per the University of California Davis Center for Poverty Research, the current poverty rate for full-time employees is 2.9 percent. However, for the unemployed, it is 33.1 percent. Arguably, the single-most important thing the government can do to reduce the poverty level is to encourage growth in higher-wage jobs for the nation\u2019s lower-skilled employee segment or promote affordable job training in low-income neighborhoods.\n\nWith America ranking 64th in the world for income inequality and with the income of most Americans shrinking with inflation, the need for relevant solutions has never been greater. While creating a bridge to cross the attainment gap is a good thing, closing the gap permanently would be better.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In the whole of American history, there have been only four serious attempts made on the federal level to establish and strengthen the social safety net.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "Frederick Reese", "og": {"site_name": "MintPress News", "description": "In the whole of American history, there have been only four serious attempts made on the federal level to establish and strengthen the social safety net.", "title": "If The \u201cWar on Poverty\u201d Failed, Then It Failed Because Of Politicians Like Paul Ryan", "url": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/war-poverty-failed-failed-politicians-like-paul-ryan/177912/", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Vice-Presidential-Deb_Webfthumb.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-01-27T09:08:16-05:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "In the whole of American history, there have been only four serious attempts made on the federal level to establish and strengthen the social safety net.", "creator": "@FrederickReese", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Vice-Presidential-Deb_Webfthumb.jpg", "title": "If The \u201cWar on Poverty\u201d Failed, Then It Failed Because Of Politicians Like Paul Ryan", "site": "@MintPressNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100003161352196}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MintpressNewsMPN", "section": "Front Page: National", "tag": "war on poverty", "published_time": "2014-01-25T05:00:37-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-01-27T09:08:16-05:00"}}, "article_summary": "If Ryan\u2019s assertion was taken to be true and the \u201cWar on Poverty\u201d failed, it failed because of politicians like Ryan, who have been willing to sacrifice social spending for vote-friendly allocations, such as military increases.\nThere has been a perception among the white middle class that social spending benefits minorities at the cost of increased taxes.\nThe hard realization is that current social spending addresses short-term needs without effectively answering the long-term problem.\nIn reality, almost all Americans \u2014 regardless of age, ethnicity, race or wealth \u2014 use a social program.\nHowever, one must accept that without what have been done with the \u201cWar on Poverty,\u201d the national poverty rate would be in excess of 30 percent."}
