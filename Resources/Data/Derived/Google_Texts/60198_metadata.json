(AP) - Comedian Jay Leno agreed to emcee a dinner next month in Las Vegas for the Newtown-based National Shooting Sports Foundation. He changed plans after Erica Lafferty Smegielski called him out.\n\nSmegielski is the daughter of Dawn Lafferty Hochsprung, the principal of Sandy Hook Elementary School who died trying to protect her staff from a shooter on a murderous rampage two years ago today.\n\n\u201cPretty sad that @jayleno thinks it\u2019s ok to make light of the murder of my mother and countless other Americans,\u201d Smegielski tweeted Nov. 19. \u201cBeyond disgusted with him.\u201d\n\nHer chastisement rocketed through gun control circles on social media. Later that night, Leno backed out, saying he thought the event was a sportsmen\u2019s show, not a pro-gun rally. Leno\u2019s decision prompted the National Shooting Sports Foundation to say Leno was lied to by the \u201canti-gun lobby.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are not deterred by their publicity seeking nor are we unfamiliar with the bullying political tactics of the gun control groups that seem to have little respect for the First Amendment as they continually demonstrate with regard to the Second Amendment,\u201d the statement read. A foundation spokesman declined to comment about Smegielski specifically, although she was one of the loudest voices in the Leno backlash.\n\nSuch is smegielski\u2019s new life, one thrust into being the morning of Dec. 14, 2012, the day her mother died of gunshot wounds in the school hallway. Smegielski channeled her grief into a mission that in a year\u2019s time would transform her into a nationally recognized face of the gun control movement.\n\nSmegielski (pronounced smeh-gel-ski) has taken stands on social media, reached out to victims of gun violence, addressed the nation\u2019s leaders from the Senate floor, and traveled to other states to step into their gun control fights. She has twice protested outside the National Rifle Association\u2019s annual convention.\n\nSmegielski spoke about her mother on NBC\u2019s Today show last year, and has been interviewed by hundreds of newspapers, magazines and television stations. This month more than 4,000 people shared a link to a remembrance of her mother she wrote that was published by the Huffington Post. Conservative bloggers revile her as misinformed and unfairly labeling all gun owners, including a self-described \u201cright-of-center\u201d blog called Gateway Pundit, which called her \u201ca committed leftist activist from Connecticut \u2026 now she attends town hall events in other states to harass Republicans who support the Second Amendment.\u201d\n\nSmegielski, who wasn\u2019t politically active before her mother\u2019s murder, dismisses the critics and says she will not sway until stricter federal laws make it more difficult to purchase guns. It\u2019s an issue that would not have prevented the Newtown shooting, but one she has adopted in its wake. Smegielski represents one of the most antagonistic political divides splintering the country, an emotionally volatile issue where constitutional rights and public safety concerns intersect in the most personal of ways.\n\nIf she could, she\u2019d wish it away in an instant, she said.\n\nSmegielski enjoyed a happy, private existence before the Newtown shootings. She worked as an admission counselor at Post University in Waterbury, was planning a wedding with a fiancee whom she had known since childhood. Her mother adored him and had always said she hoped they would marry. Smegielski was enjoying an adult relationship with her mother, whom she called her best friend.\n\nJust before 10 a.m. Dec. 14, 2012, Smegielski\u2019s phone pinged: a breaking news alert from NBC30. Shooting reported at Sandy Hook Elementary School.\n\nSmegielski, who had that day off, called her sister, Tina Lafferty Hassinger, who was with three of her four children at Target in Waterbury. Smegielski wanted to rush to Sandy Hook; her sister persuaded her to meet at her house in Watertown. \u201cTina said, \u2018Mom would be so mad at you if you walked into a dangerous situation where a gunman was on the loose,\u201d Smegielski said.\n\nParents at the scene told television reporters the principal had been shot.\n\n\u201cI just remember my brother-in-law throwing the remote down, and Tina frantically trying to find the batteries so she could rewind and make sure she heard it correctly,\u201d Smegielski said.\n\nThe daughters rushed to sandy hook, pulling up to confusion and panic. They found George Hochsprung, their mother\u2019s husband, and the three joined crowds of terrified relatives near the Sandy Hook firehouse searching for parents and wives and children.\n\n\u201cWe asked a father with his son, \u2018Have you seen the principal?\u2019 The kid looked up at us and said, \u2018No, she\u2019s \u2026\u2019 Before he finished his sentence, his father put his hand over the kid\u2019s mouth and said, \u2018No, I\u2019m sorry. We don\u2019t know anything.\u201d\n\nA firefighter escorted them into a back room of the firehouse. They waited for hours. They were told not to leave.\n\nBy mid-afternoon, Gov. Dannel P. Malloy walked in to address the families of 26 people. \u201cNo one left in the building is alive,\u201d the governor told them.\n\nPeople collapsed in shock. Screams pierced the air. \u201cChaos,\u201d Smegielski said.\n\n\u201cThe whole time, I\u2019m thinking that my mom should be here, because she needs to help these parents,\u201d she said.\n\nThat night, Smegielski curled herself into a love seat at her aunt\u2019s house in Naugatuck, overcome with grief.\n\nThe phone rang incessantly, reporter after reporter, from around the globe.\n\nDawn hochsprung had been helping to plan her daughter\u2019s upcoming wedding, including picking the gown. They envisioned a summer wedding for Erica Lafferty and Chris Smegielski in the backyard of a home Hochspring and her husband were building in the Adirondacks.\n\nMother and daughter had always been close. Smegielski, who lives in Prospect, grew up in a blue collar neighborhood on the west side of Naugatuck. Hochspring was a young, single mother who raised Erica and Tina as she worked her way through college.\n\nErica carries a strong resemblance of her mother: thin build, brown hair, large brown eyes and pearly smile. Both loved to laugh and joke, but Dawn Hochsprung, who was 47 when she died, was known for fiercely committed attitude when circumstances demanded it. It\u2019s how she died, yelling, \u201cShooter! Stay put!\u201d and running toward gunman Adam Lanza, according to multiple witness accounts.\n\nSmegielski didn\u2019t always possess her mother\u2019s determination or attitude. She dropped out of high school before later earning associate\u2019s and bachelor\u2019s degrees at Naugatuck Valley Community College and at Post. When her mother died, she told family and friends she did not think she could muster the strength to go through with the wedding, to take such a major step forward in her life.\n\nBut she did, eight months after the shooting, resplendent and glowing in her strapless white gown and flowing silk veil. She and her husband married in the Adirondacks, just as planned, except now it was also near her mother\u2019s grave, not just the house to which she dreamed of retiring.\n\nLike any wedding, the day focused on the couple, a celebration of their new life. Still, Smegielski visited her mother\u2019s grave that morning, wearing her gown and veil, and kissed the headstone. On her wrist, she wore a green bracelet, the color adopted by Sandy Hook shooting victims and supporters. It was the rubbery kind onto which people can have messages printed across the band. Erica\u2019s read: \u201cWhat would Dawn do?\u201d\n\nSmegielski decided to push for gun control after watching television one spring afternoon in 2013. She had been wrapped in a fleece blanket on her couch, which is how she had been spending a lot of time since her mother\u2019s death, uninterested in venturing into the warming weather or in hearing people say how sorry they were.\n\nShe saw a news report about the Manchin-Toomey bill stalling in Washington. The bill, proposed by Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Republican Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, sought to establish a federal law that would close some loopholes in requirements for background checks, particularly involving gun shows, online sales and private, rather than retail, transactions.\n\nSmegielski turned on her computer and looked up the word \u201cfilibuster.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was not into politics at all,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I learned it meant they possibly wouldn\u2019t vote, I was appalled.\u201d\n\nSmegielski started tweeting elected officials, including Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, who was threatening the filibuster. She sent pictures of her mother and tried shaming officials into voting.\n\n\u201cI told them that my mom did everything she could to protect what could have been considered my mom\u2019s constituents, the people in her school,\u201d Smegielski said. \u201cMy mom did her job that day - imagine how many more would have died if she didn\u2019t get in front of the gunman? So if she did her job, why weren\u2019t they going to do theirs?\u201d\n\nCruz called Smegielski. From that same couch where she had sought retreat, she engaged him in a passionate but respectful debate for about 20 minutes. They agreed to disagree.\n\nSomething within Smegielski stirred.\n\nWithin months, she stood at a town-hall meeting in New Hampshire - the one which prompted the conservative blogger to hail her as a liberal activist from Connecticut. She confronted Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-New Hampshire, who voted against the Manchin-Toomey bill, which by then had failed in a 54-46 vote.\n\n\u201cYou had mentioned \u2026 the burden on owners of gun stores that the expanded background checks would cause,\u201d Smegielski said to the hall packed with residents and journalists. \u201cI\u2019m just wondering why the burden of my mother being gunned down in the hallway of her elementary school isn\u2019t as important as that.\u201d\n\nSoon, Mayors Against Illegal Guns, founded and largely funded by former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, hired Smegielski. The organization has since merged with Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America and changed its name to Everytown for Gun Safety.\n\n\u201cI spent my entire working life in some form of customer or student service,\u201d Smegielski said. \u201cI worked at a Verizon call center, and I loved that job. But how do I go back to a job where my primary responsibility is to listen to someone complain about an overage on their cellphone bill when 86 Americans are being shot to death every day? There are bigger issues out there and bigger things for me to do.\u201d\n\nEverytown for gun safety focuses largely on expanded background checks, a step Smegielski acknowledges would have made no difference in the Sandy Hook murders, where the gunman stole his weapons from his mother, who had legally purchased them.\n\nSmegielski said the organization focuses on background checks because \u201cevery law enforcement officer and every study done says that is the single fastest and most effective way to save as many people as possible.\u201d\n\nStacey Radnor, deputy communications director for Everytown for Gun Safety, called Smegielski a fearless, passionate and dedicated advocate.\n\n\u201cShe is a beaming light of motivation,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can just tell with everything she does that the bond between her and her mother was so strong, and that comes through with everything she does.\u201d\n\nRadnor said much of Smegielski\u2019s work involves reaching out to survivors of gun violence to tell them about programs Everytown for Gun Safety has available and of efforts to curb gun violence. Radnor said that after the Isla Vista shootings near the campus of U.C. Santa Barbara in California on May 23, Smegielski immediately reached out to Richard Martinez, father of Christopher Michaels-Martinez, one of the six people who died in that shooting.\n\nRichard Martinez said he and Smegielski have become close. She has given him personal advice and told him ways to use his story to try to make a difference. He also said they are similar in the way they grieve.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t keep it inside, we speak out,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are committed \u2026 We are on a mission because the longer it takes to get background checks in place and reduce gun violence, the more kids like my son are going to die. For people like Erica\u2019s mother and all those kids at Sandy Hook to die is just not right.\u201d\n\nSmegielski has forged her new identity, and she\u2019s not letting go.\n\n\u201cOnce Erica puts her mind to something, she can do anything she wants,\u201d said Melissa Lewis of Woodbury, who has been friends with Smegielski since they met at Nonnewaug High School in 2001. Lewis saw her friend drop out of Nonnewaug, then go on to earn college degrees, and now rise from crippling grief to lobby for a mission that has become her life\u2019s calling.\n\nSmegielski said she tries to live her mother\u2019s words every day: \u201cBe Nice to Each Other. That\u2019s All That Really Matters.\u201d She says she receives hate mail, has been called a liar, and been the target of death threats.\n\nShe maintains she is not \u201canti-gun.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust show me that you can pass a background check, that you are a responsible person and that you will store it away from children and away from people with mental illness who may be a danger to themselves and others. I\u2019m all for the Second Amendment, but that does go hand in hand with responsible gun ownership.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Republican-American, http://www.rep-am.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "Comedian Jay Leno agreed to emcee a dinner next month in Las Vegas for the Newtown-based National Shooting Sports Foundation.
