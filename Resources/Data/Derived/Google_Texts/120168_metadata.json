In fact, peas, green vegetables, and beans have more protein per calorie than meat.\u201d\n\nMorissette, in a 2009 interview with People magazine, calls reading \u201cEat to Live\u201d a \u201credefining moment\u201d in her life. The singer had battled eating disorders her whole life and was mocked for being fat. After following Fuhrman\u2019s lifestyle change and diet plan, she lost weight and exercised more, running 20 miles a week.\n\n\n\nFuhrman laments growing rates of obesity and diseases resulting from unhealthy diets in America, saying, \u201cwe\u2019re destroying the land, we\u2019re destroying people\u2019s health, people are getting more sick, which is requiring more medical attention and care.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur population can\u2019t walk and can\u2019t perform; it\u2019s ruining their intellectual abilities on the job,\u201d he tells JNS.org. \u201cWe cannot compete worldwide and we are paying so much for medical care costs. If we\u2019re going to expect to compete in the world marketplace, and even to survive as a nation or as a species for hundreds of years, we have got to take better care of the Earth and our health.\u201d\n\n\n\nAccording to Mark Epstein, president of the National Health Association, Fuhrman presents a nutritional roadmap to optimum health.\n\n\u201cHis information is painstakingly researched and supported, yet he presents the results with an easy-to-follow style,\u201d Epstein says. \u201cHe states the facts and educates us to make the food choices that will help us overcome disease and regain health. His book \u2018Eat to Live\u2019 marks the beginning of a genuine, scientifically-based health revolution.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cEat to Live\u201d is not just about counting calories and eating less, but also about protecting the body against disease, says the author.\n\n\n\n\u201cI go through the biology and the physiology showing how higher nutrient consumption suppresses appetite and reduces food addictions and food cravings,\u201d Fuhrman says. \u201cThe diet I recommend is much more promotion of long life, heart attack protection, reduction of cancer risk, and prevention of dementia and strokes. It\u2019s much more aggressive as far as disease protection.\u201d\n\n\n\nFuhrman coined the word \u201cnutritarian\u201d for those who adopt a diet based on his simple formula: Health = Nutrients/Calories. Simply, your health is predicted by your nutrient intake divided by your intake of calories, in Fuhrman\u2019s estimation.\n\n\n\n\u201cYour key to permanent weight loss is to eat predominantly those foods that have a high proportion of nutrients to calories. Every food can be evaluated using this formula,\u201d he says.\n\n\n\nHealthy food can also taste great, notes Fuhrman.\n\n\u201cYou like what you get used to eating,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen you start eating healthy, you start liking it. It\u2019s all about changing your habits and giving your taste buds a chance to adapt.\u201d\n\n\n\nExercise is another key element to Fuhrman\u2019s proposed \u201cnutritarian\u201d lifestyle. A former member of the U.S. World Figure Skating Team, Fuhrman placed second in the U.S. National Pairs Championship in 1973. He came in 3rd place at the 1976 World Professional Pairs Skating Championship in Jaca, Spain, with partner Gale Fuhrman. At nearly 60, he still enjoys physical activities, such as playing tennis and skiing.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf we eat these foods that are dramatically protective, we can be protected,\u201d Furhman says. \u201cWhen you are protected, you feel well, you have energy, you maintain your youthful vigor, and you can live life and do what you want to do. You can exercise, you can climb mountains.\u201d\n\nDownload this story in Microsoft Word format here.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "JNS.org", "description": "While the national debate on \u201cObamacare\u201d rages on, bestselling Jewish \r\nauthor Dr. Joel Fuhrman says the \u201ccurrent disease care model of what we \r\ncall \u2018health care\u2019 cannot possibly be sustained.\u201d Fuhrman tells\u00a0JNS.org, \r\n\u201cThere is simply not enough money available to support a system in which \r\nthe lion\u2019s share of expenditures is devoted to acute care, with virtually \r\nnothing being spent on preventive medicine, i.e. health care.\u201d Fuhrman\u2014a \r\nmember of Jewish Vegetarians of North America\u2014is best known for his popular \r\n2011 book \u201cEat to Live,\u201d which tries to make a case for how Americans \r\nshould change their diets and for why what they usually eat is killing \r\nthem.", "title": "Jewish author of \u2018Eat to Live\u2019 dishes on health care, nutrition, disease prevention", "url": "http://www.jns.org/latest-articles/2014/4/11/jewish-author-of-eat-to-live-dishes-on-health-care-nutrition-disease-prevention", "image": "http://static1.squarespace.com/static/5126bbb4e4b08c2e6d1cb6e4/t/53484f6ce4b0531dce75da11/1431802845684/Fuhrman-pic.jpg?format=1000w", "longitude": "-74.00076130000002", "latitude": "40.7207559", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.jns.org/latest-articles/2014/4/11/jewish-author-of-eat-to-live-dishes-on-health-care-nutrition-disease-prevention", "image": "http://static1.squarespace.com/static/5126bbb4e4b08c2e6d1cb6e4/t/53484f6ce4b0531dce75da11/1431802845684/Fuhrman-pic.jpg?format=1000w", "description": "While the national debate on \u201cObamacare\u201d rages on, bestselling Jewish \r\nauthor Dr. Joel Fuhrman says the \u201ccurrent disease care model of what we \r\ncall \u2018health care\u2019 cannot possibly be sustained.\u201d Fuhrman tells\u00a0JNS.org, \r\n\u201cThere is simply not enough money available to support a system in which \r\nthe lion\u2019s share of expenditures is devoted to acute care, with virtually \r\nnothing being spent on preventive medicine, i.e. health care.\u201d Fuhrman\u2014a \r\nmember of Jewish Vegetarians of North America\u2014is best known for his popular \r\n2011 book \u201cEat to Live,\u201d which tries to make a case for how Americans \r\nshould change their diets and for why what they usually eat is killing \r\nthem.", "card": "summary", "title": "Jewish author of \u2018Eat to Live\u2019 dishes on health care, nutrition, disease prevention"}, "description": "While the national debate on \u201cObamacare\u201d rages on, bestselling Jewish \r\nauthor Dr. Joel Fuhrman says the \u201ccurrent disease care model of what we \r\ncall \u2018health care\u2019 cannot possibly be sustained.\u201d Fuhrman tells\u00a0JNS.org, \r\n\u201cThere is simply not enough money available to support a system in which \r\nthe lion\u2019s share of expenditures is devoted to acute care, with virtually \r\nnothing being spent on preventive medicine, i.e. health care.\u201d Fuhrman\u2014a \r\nmember of Jewish Vegetarians of North America\u2014is best known for his popular \r\n2011 book \u201cEat to Live,\u201d which tries to make a case for how Americans \r\nshould change their diets and for why what they usually eat is killing \r\nthem.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcedfe\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWhen you are protected, you feel well, you have energy, you maintain your youthful vigor, and you can live life and do what you want to do.\n\u201cHe states the facts and educates us to make the food choices that will help us overcome disease and regain health.\nHis book \u2018Eat to Live\u2019 marks the beginning of a genuine, scientifically-based health revolution.\u201d\u201cEat to Live\u201d is not just about counting calories and eating less, but also about protecting the body against disease, says the author.\n\u201cI go through the biology and the physiology showing how higher nutrient consumption suppresses appetite and reduces food addictions and food cravings,\u201d Fuhrman says.\nAfter following Fuhrman\u2019s lifestyle change and diet plan, she lost weight and exercised more, running 20 miles a week."}
