Their questions \u2014 most of which were held in closed session with Corporation Counsel attorneys \u2014 were enough to force a postponement of the vote until Feb. 3.\n\nIf approved then, that will still give the county time to seat the new members at the next scheduled Board of Ethics meeting Feb. 10, said Deputy Corporation Counsel J Yoshimoto, who represents the Ethics Board.\n\nCouncil members quizzed nominee Josephine Ibarra on whether she could vote independently, even if she had been recruited and supported by an Ethics Board member.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m coming in as an individual; I\u2019m coming in to listen; I\u2019m coming in to voice my opinion,\u201d Ibarra said.\n\nIbarra, of North Kona, is the care coordinator/resident manager of HI Affordable Properties and volunteers at St. Michael the Archangel Church in Kailua-Kona. She also volunteers with organizations that help the homeless in the Kona community, according to information provided the council.\n\nSouth Kona/Ka\u2018u Councilwoman Maile David said she knows Ibarra from Ibarra\u2019s community work.\n\n\u201cI applaud you because I know you\u2019re an independent thinker and you will be fair. I totally support your nomination,\u201d David told Ibarra.\n\nThe other nominee, G. Rick Robinson, of Kona, was not at the meeting. Robinson just completed a five-year term on the county Water Board.\n\nHe also served two terms on the Civil Service Commission, now the Merit Appeals Board. He is a member of the Kona Coffee Cultural Festival and Council, the Kona Soil and Water Conservation District and the Kona Farm Bureau.\n\nThe two West Hawaii members address concerns by the council and some members of the public that the Ethics Board had no West Hawaii representation.\n\nIn related action, the council again postponed a bill putting a charter amendment on the ballot changing the appointment process, number and length of term for Ethics Board members.\n\nThe measure would give the council more appointing authority that\u2019s typically held by the mayor.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just a matter of quorum, but it\u2019s a matter of diversity and independence,\u201d said Kohala Councilwoman Margaret Wille, sponsor of Bill 101 that would add the amendment to the November general election ballot and take effect Dec. 5.\n\nPaleka, however, pushed for the matter to be set to rest indefinitely. He said the earlier nomination vote postponement showed that the council has power to decide board membership.\n\n\u201cToday was an example,\u201d Paleka said. \u201cWe had the opportunity to name two individuals and we didn\u2019t. \u2026 We all have a job to do, us and the mayor.\u201d\n\nThe board handles ethics complaints from residents about public officials. It also provides advisory letters to public officials about ethics issues, such as whether they can take on outside jobs. And, it reviews annual gift disclosures and financial disclosures of a host of officials and county employees in certain positions.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Local News,topnews,", "og": {"site_name": "Hawaii Tribune-Herald", "description": "Despite a long wait to bolster the membership of the county Board of Ethics, the County Council on Friday postponed action on two nominees who would fill the five-member panel.", "title": "Council postpones action on Ethics Board nominees", "url": "http://hawaiitribune-herald.com/news/local-news/council-postpones-action-ethics-board-nominees", "image": "http://hawaiitribune-herald.com/sites/hawaiitribune-herald.com/files/field/image/2836011_web1_Ethics1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Despite a long wait to bolster the membership of the county Board of Ethics, the County Council on Friday postponed action on two nominees who would fill the five-member panel.", "viewport": "width=100%, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "Despite a long wait to bolster the membership of the county Board of Ethics, the County Council on Friday postponed action on two nominees who would fill the five-member panel.\nHilo Councilmen Dennis \u201cFresh\u201d Onishi and Aaron Chung questioned the involvement of Ethics Board Chairwoman Ku Kahakalau in recruiting and endorsing the new nominees.\nIn related action, the council again postponed a bill putting a charter amendment on the ballot changing the appointment process, number and length of term for Ethics Board members.\nCouncil members quizzed nominee Josephine Ibarra on whether she could vote independently, even if she had been recruited and supported by an Ethics Board member.\n\u2026 We all have a job to do, us and the mayor.\u201dThe board handles ethics complaints from residents about public officials."}
