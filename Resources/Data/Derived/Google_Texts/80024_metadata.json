But she didn't expect abortion opponents to make her church a target.\n\n\"The congregation had just lost two beloved members,\" said Vandiver, the community minister for the Greater New Orleans Unitarian Universalists and executive director for the Center for Ethical Living and Social Justice Renewal, recalling a service she led in July. \"We were holding this time of silence and meditation for all the grief in our hearts. And in that silence, in that meditative space of prayer, one of the members of this group started to speak out, 'You're an abomination, you're a great deceiver, these children are going to go to Hell,' in the midst of this very tender holy moment.\"\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\nAt the same time, other protesters milled about outside the church day care windows, holding up photos of bloody fetuses. The day care volunteers ushered the children into a classroom without windows, leaving a note on the door indicating their location for worried parents.\n\nThe church's crime? It had hosted an event to kick off the construction of a new Planned Parenthood clinic in New Orleans.\n\nThat clinic, a $4.2 million project, has exposed a deep fissure between many of the people who reside in this libertine, diverse town and those who control the moneyed religious institutions, the national anti-abortion movement, and the state government.\n\nMost Popular\n\nFor Planned Parenthood employees, the clinic is an urgent matter of public health: Louisiana has some of the highest rates of sexually transmitted infections in the country, and 58 percent of pregnancies are unintended. They began construction of the proposed 8,000-square-foot facility in May 2013, planning to open in late 2014 or early 2015. Planned Parenthood has never performed abortions in Louisiana. But with just five abortion clinics in the state, this new clinic would offer terminations as part of a long list of other reproductive health services, including annual exams, sexual health education, Pap smears, cancer screenings, birth control access, and STD testing and treatment.\n\nThe Catholic Church, the state, and the national anti-abortion movement caught wind of the new clinic early and swept in to block it. Contractors and subcontractors have been intimidated out of working on the project by the threat of being blacklisted from future construction projects and targeted for harassment by abortion foes. Those who stay find their names and personal information published on anti-abortion websites. And earlier this month, the Louisiana Department of Health denied Planned Parenthood's application to build a facility that performs abortions.\n\nMore than a year after the kickoff, the future clinic site is still an empty lot, overgrown with weeds aside from what appears to be the foundation of a building. On the partially broken fence, there are a few signs: \"High Quality Affordable Health Care for New Orleans. Coming Soon!\" \"More Health Care. Not Hate.\" \"Our New Health Center \u2013 Seeing Patients in 2015.\"\n\nReligious Opposition\n\nNew Orleans is a Catholic town, and the powerful church is a major owner of land and buildings in the city. The state and federal governments gave hundreds of millions of dollars to the church for post-Katrina building efforts, and money for church-led construction projects keeps pouring in. But in a letter printed in the archdiocese's newspaper in January 2014, Archbishop Gregory Aymond made himself clear: Help build that clinic, and you'll never work in this town again.\n\n\"The archdiocese is obliged to remind every person and organization involved in the acquisition, preparation and construction of this or any abortion facility that they are cooperating with the evil that will take place there,\" Aymond wrote (the archdiocese declined to comment for this article, saying Aymond wanted his letter to stand on its own). \"For this reason, the archdiocese, including its churches, schools, apartments for the elderly and nursing homes, will strive in its privately funded work not to enter into business relationships with any person or organization that participates in actions that are essential to making this abortion facility a reality. This policy applies to all businesses, regardless of religious affiliation or non-affiliation.\"\n\nHe stressed that \"no justification, including economic hardship,\" would make it acceptable to work with Planned Parenthood, and any support of Planned Parenthood whatsoever is \"a matter of serious scandal.\" With their ability to work on dozens of future schools, nursing homes, and other church-financed projects on the line, many New Orleans contractors decided working on one Planned Parenthood clinic wasn't worth the sacrifice.\n\n\"That proved to be a powerful threat,\" said Sharon Howard, the former assistant secretary of the Louisiana Office of Public Health, who came out of retirement to help build the clinic. \"You have all of that money that came in after Katrina, and [the archdiocese has] lots of money on the books to build schools back, and basically they ran off all the contractors.\"", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.contenttype": "article", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/04/160x160/square_nrm_1422048531-_p1a4939.jpg", "description": "Planned Parenthood has $4 million to build a new clinic in New Orleans.
