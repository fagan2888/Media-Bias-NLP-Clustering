Residents living on Bruce Jenner Lane in Austin, Texas, have expressed apprehension about changing the street name to follow the former Olympian’s public transition to a female identity, Caitlyn Jenner.

In the Olympic Heights neighborhood, homeowners live on streets named after famous Olympians, such as Georgia Coleman, Wilma Rudolph, and Jim Thorpe Lane. Bruce Jenner Lane, where the homes were built in 2006 and 2007, is about a third of a mile long, a local ABC affiliate reported.

Neighbors said tourists have been stopping by to snap photos of the street signs, the station reported. While most residents say they support Ms. Jenner’s decision to go by Caitlyn, they hope their street will remain the same, due to the hassle that a name change will cause, ABC said.

“We just hope that someone is smart enough to realize all the trouble it’s going to cause for regular people if you change the name,” homeowner Ray Briggs said.

Austin requires at least half of the street’s residents to approve the change as well as the city council before a street can be renamed, ABC reported.

Streets named after Bruce Jenner still remain in Clarksville, Tennessee, and El Paso, Texas.
