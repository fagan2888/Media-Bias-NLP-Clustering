Eissa said that the decision was in response to Tuesday\u2019s deadly bombing targeting a police headquarters in a Nile Delta city which killed 16 people and wounded more than 100. The Brotherhood has denied being responsible for Mansoura attack and an al-Qaida inspired group has claimed responsibility for the suicide bombing on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cEgypt was horrified from north to south by the hideous crime committed by the Muslim Brotherhood group,\u201d Eissa said. \u201cThis was in context of dangerous escalation to violence against Egypt and Egyptians (and) a clear declaration by the Muslim Brotherhood group that it is still knows nothing but violence.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not possible for Egypt the state nor Egypt the people to submit to the Muslim Brotherhood terrorism,\u201d he added.\n\nEissa offered no evidence in his speech linking the Brotherhood to Tuesday\u2019s attack.\n\nThe Brotherhood, founded in 1928, denounced violence in the late 1970s. Ibrahim Elsayed, a member of the Muslim Brotherhood\u2019s political group, the Freedom and Justice Party, said the government announcement will have no impact on the work or the beliefs of the group, because it has seen repeated government repression and continued to exist with a moderate view of Islam.\n\n\u201cThis decision is as if it never happened. It has no value for us and is only worth the paper it is written on,\u201d he told The Associated Press. \u201cIt won\u2019t impact us from near and far. Ideas won\u2019t be impacted by false accusations. We uphold this call only for the sake of God.\u201d\n\nThe declaration, Eissa said, means that those who \u201cparticipate in the group\u2019s activities, in the organization or promotion verbally or by writing or by any other means or financing its activities\u201d will be facing punishment according to the law. He said that the government had notified other Arab countries about its decision. The Brotherhood has organizations and political parties in other nations in the region.\n\nAhmed el-Borai, the Minister of Social Solidarity, told reporters in a news conference that the decision means \u201call activities of the Muslim Brotherhood group are \u2014 banned including the demonstrations.\u201d He said that members who abandon their membership and withdraw from the group \u201cwill be pardoned.\u201d\n\nThe declaration also gives the armed forces and the police the right to enter universities and prevent protests, as \u201cprotection to the students,\u201d el-Borai said.\n\nThe decision comes after a sweeping decision Tuesday aimed at draining the Brotherhood\u2019s finances by freezing the funds of more than 1,000 non-government organizations with links to the group and putting more than 100 schools run by the group under government supervision. That directly attacks the grassroots strength of the Brotherhood, where it has much of its power in Egyptian life.\n\nRifaat Laqoushah, a political analyst, said that the government decision is \u201cprocedural\u201d and that it could be overturned by the courts.\n\n\u201cThe government should present strong evidence of the Muslim Brotherhood collaboration in terrorism and present it to courts in order to win a court ruling branding the group as a terrorist one,\u201d Laqoushah said.\n\nEarlier Wednesday, Ansar Beit al-Maqdis, or the Champions of Jerusalem, said in an online statement that it carried out the attack in Mansoura police headquarters attack Tuesday to avenge the \u201cshedding of innocent Muslim blood\u201d at the hands of Egypt\u2019s \u201capostate regime\u201d \u2014 a reference to the security forces\u2019 crackdown on Islamists following the coup.\n\nWhile the claim posted on a militant website could not be absolutely verified, it corresponded with previous messages issued by the group on the same forum. It identified the suicide bomber in Tuesday\u2019s attack by the nickname Abu Mariam.\n\nThe explosion in Mansoura, 110 kilometers (70 miles) north of Cairo, was the deadliest bombing yet in a months-long wave of violence blamed on Islamic militants.\n\nThe blast was so powerful it collapsed an entire section and side wall of the five-floor building, incinerating dozens of cars outside and damaging several nearby buildings.\n\nA security official said it appears the Mansoura bomber drove a pickup truck laden with explosives close to the police headquarters, then detonated it. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the investigation with journalists, said that Cairo airport authorities arrested a Brotherhood member late Tuesday on suspicion that he was linked to the attack.\n\nThe suspect \u2014 identified as 22-year-old Adel Younis Rashid who runs a computer shop in Mansoura \u2014 was taken into custody as he was trying to fly to Turkey with his mother and a friend, the official said.\n\nThe suspect is the son of a leading Brotherhood member and former lawmaker from Mansoura, the official said, adding that authorities have confiscated Rashid\u2019s computers and telephones.\n\nAnsar Beit al-Maqdis has emerged as the main Sinai-based militant group staging attacks against Egyptian security forces. The group has claimed most major attacks in the Sinai and Suez Canal-area cities in recent months, as well as a failed attempt to assassinate the country\u2019s interior minister in September.\n\nOn Monday, Ansar Beit al-Maqdis issued a message threatening more attacks against Egyptian troops, saying it considers them to be infidels because they answer to the secular-leaning government.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Sarah El Deeb contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Egypt's military-backed interim government on Wednesday declared the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist group, criminalizing all its activities, its financing and even membership to the group from which the country's ousted president hails.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Egypt\u2019s military-backed interim government on Wednesday declared the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist group, criminalizing all its activities, its financing and even membership to the group from which the country\u2019s ousted president hails.", "title": "Egypt names Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist group", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/dec/25/egypt-names-muslim-brotherhood-terrorist-group/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/12/24/aptopix-mideast-egyptjpeg-0c8ac.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/12/24/aptopix-mideast-egyptjpeg-0c8ac.jpg", "description": "Egypt's military-backed interim government on Wednesday declared the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist group, criminalizing all its activities, its financing and even membership to the group from which t", "card": "summary", "title": "Egypt names Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist group"}, "Author": "Maggie Michael", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, War Conflict, Muslim Brotherhood, Mansoura, Egypt"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9677\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThis was in context of dangerous escalation to violence against Egypt and Egyptians (and) a clear declaration by the Muslim Brotherhood group that it is still knows nothing but violence.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not possible for Egypt the state nor Egypt the people to submit to the Muslim Brotherhood terrorism,\u201d he added.\n\u201cEgypt was horrified from north to south by the hideous crime committed by the Muslim Brotherhood group,\u201d Eissa said.\nCAIRO (AP) \u2014 Egypt\u2019s military-backed interim government on Wednesday declared the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist group, criminalizing all its activities, its financing and even membership to the group from which the country\u2019s ousted president hails.\nThe Brotherhood has denied being responsible for Mansoura attack and an al-Qaida inspired group has claimed responsibility for the suicide bombing on Wednesday.\n\u201cThe government should present strong evidence of the Muslim Brotherhood collaboration in terrorism and present it to courts in order to win a court ruling branding the group as a terrorist one,\u201d Laqoushah said."}
