Scott Shim\n\nIt could be the most usable clothing accessory you never realized you needed: A hairbrush with movable parts that allows you to easily clean out the gunk that builds up with regular use.\n\nCo-created by Scott Shin, an associate professor of design at Ohio State University, he hopes that his unique product, named the MAZE hairbrush, can encourage people to hold onto them for longer periods of time.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want people to have to throw away a perfectly good hairbrush just because it needs to be cleaned,\u201d Shim said in a statement.\n\nThe lightly-haired Shim was initially inspired by seeing his wife cleaning her hairbrush.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t understand why she had to do that. Obviously, this is not a problem for me,\u201d he said. \u201cThen I did some market research, and found out how often hairbrushes get thrown out \u2014 not because they\u2019re worn out, but because they\u2019re disgusting and people didn\u2019t maintain them well.\" According to Shim's research, many people only keep their brushes for six months to a year before throwing them out.\n\nTeaming up with co-creator Morris Koo, a MFA alumni at OSU, the two tried to design a brush that could simplify the process of cleaning up.\n\n\u201cOur goal was for the user to easily remove hair from the bristles. We latched on to this idea that brushes usually have a solid surface that gets in the way of cleaning,\u201d Shim said. \u201cWe decided that the best solution would be to create a brush with an open surface, where the user could actually open it and just grab the hair.\u201d\n\nCreated via a 3-D printer, with bristles added by hand afterwards, the two are hoping that they can make improvements in the composition of their patented product before beginning mass production, since the current type of plastic used now can be brittle and prone to snapping when the bristles are added.\n\nTheir prototype has already earned some high distinctions, however. It won first place in the Beauty, Personal Care and Cosmetic Products Design Category of the A' Design Awards in Italy, and won a Green Product Award from the German \u201cfull-service\u201d agency, white lobster, both in 2014.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "easy, clean, hairbrush, makes, it, snap, remove, hair, gunk, even, after, months, use", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "An Ohio State University professor has invented a hairbrush that's much easier to clean.", "title": "Meet The Hairbrush That's Easy To Clean", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/easy-clean-hairbrush-makes-it-snap-remove-hair-gunk-even-after-months-use-351046", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/09/02/mazebrushfull.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "An Ohio State University professor has invented a hairbrush that's much easier to clean.", "title": "Meet The Hairbrush That's Easy To Clean", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/easy-clean-hairbrush-makes-it-snap-remove-hair-gunk-even-after-months-use-351046", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/09/02/mazebrushfull.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/09/02/mazebrushfull.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-09-02T21:11:06-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-02T22:25:03-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "An Ohio State University professor has invented a hairbrush that's much easier to clean."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3905\"", "article_summary": "Called the MAZE hairbrush because of its patterning, its creators claim that cleaning the hair out of it is much easier than with an ordinary hairbrush.\nWe latched on to this idea that brushes usually have a solid surface that gets in the way of cleaning,\u201d Shim said.\n\u201cOur goal was for the user to easily remove hair from the bristles.\nThe lightly-haired Shim was initially inspired by seeing his wife cleaning her hairbrush.\nAccording to Shim's research, many people only keep their brushes for six months to a year before throwing them out."}
