As such, we have decided for the time being to suspend our participation in activities associated with the preparation of the scheduled G-8 Summit in Sochi in June, until the environment comes back where the G-8 is able to have a meaningful discussion.\n\nSome G8 members (the US and the UK) previously announced that they would not be participating in Summit planning following Russia's invasion of the Ukraine. Now it's all of them except for the one that's doing the invading.\n\nEarlier today, Secretary of State John Kerry said Russia could be kicked out of the G8 if it didn't pull out of Ukraine. President Putin is also the president of the G8, so that's awkward. Upon becoming the president of the G8 at the beginning of this year, Putin issued a statement saying: \"the motto of Russia's G8 Presidency in 2014\" is \"risk management for sustainable growth in a safe world.\" One way to do this, said the statement, was \"settling regional conflicts.\"\n\n\"Russia is open to cooperating and dialogue,\" the statement concluded. \"We have much to do, and we are confident that this work will bring about a significant, positive result.\"\n\nRussia joined the G7 to form the G8 in 1997. In last year's G8 summit, Putin was criticized by the other leaders for his support of Syria's president Bashar al-Assad. Good to see he took that to heart.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The 2014 G8 summit in Sochi just got a lot more complicated.
