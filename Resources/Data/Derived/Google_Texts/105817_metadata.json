Bruce Braley may yet become a senator from Iowa. Half a year has passed since Braley, a four-term Democrat from the state\u2019s bluest district, was filmed telling some out-of-state lawyers why they needed to donate to his campaign. If he lost, \u201cyou might have a farmer from Iowa who never went to law school, never practiced law, serving as the next chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee,\u201d said Braley. \u201cIf Democrats lose the majority, Chuck Grassley will be the next chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee.\u201d\n\nDavid Weigel David Weigel is a reporter for the Washington Post.\n\nIt was a gaffe par excellence, not just because Republicans got so much out of it. (Say \u201cfarmer from Iowa\u201d at any GOP rally there and the crowd stars laughing.) The candidate absorbed the damage, mostly, and has fought his Republican opponent to a tie with a razor-edged, ideological campaign about entitlements and wages.\n\nNo: This was a perfect gaffe because Braley was telling his donors the truth. If they cared about nothing else, they needed to realize how close Democrats were to losing committee chairmanships. They could have Vermont Sen. Pat Leahy holding the gavel, or they could have a tort reformer who wanted to eliminate three seats on the D.C. Circuit and lock in a conservative majority for years. Almost none of the campaign promises of 2014 would matter. The majority and the gavel would.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nRepublicans have had years to imagine what it would be like to have control of the Senate. If they win it, in six weeks, they won\u2019t be able to do much. With a sweep of the races in red states, they\u2019ll win a 52\u201348 majority. If they upset Democrats in the blue states where the GOP is polling the strongest\u2014Iowa, Colorado, and New Hampshire\u2014they\u2019ll finally restore the majority they lost in 2006. They won\u2019t get close to the 60-vote cloture threshold to pass legislation. Indeed, they\u2019ll already be tapping donors for a 2016 election in which most of the vulnerable seats belong to their party. \u201cIf we don\u2019t win the Senate in 2014,\u201d Rick Santorum says in his campaign speeches, \u201cwe won\u2019t win it in 2016.\u201d He\u2019s not wrong.\n\nSo, how would a Republican Senate change Washington? Conversations with senators, congressmen, and staffers from both parties suggest a brief period of conflict\u2014which would peter out as the presidential primaries got underway\u2014and a long war against the president getting any of the nominees he wants. That\u2019s a good place to start.\n\nNominations\n\nThe twin filibuster reforms of 2013 were probably the greatest achievements of President Obama\u2019s second term, ending the 60-vote chokepoint for all nominees for offices below the Supreme Court. They allowed the president to get his picks for the Cabinet, for circuit courts\u2014including the D.C. Circuit that is likely to squelch new challenges of the Affordable Care Act. If there was a voter backlash, Democrats never felt it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nSenate Republican leader Mitch McConnell has hinted at a new \u201cconversation,\u201d after the election, about undoing the rule change. There\u2019s some worry among Republicans about ramming this through with the majority\u2019s votes, instead of changing the rules with a two-thirds supermajority. That might be viewed as \u201cusing the nuclear option to undo the nuclear option.\u201d The change would need to be reframed as a house-cleaning measure, a stand against Harry Reid\u2019s recklessness. Everyone agrees this would be a slog if Republicans won a majority with six red-state wins, and exponentially easier with every seat they picked up in a blue state.\n\nBeyond Obamacare, the theory goes that a Republican Senate can liberate all of the House GOP\u2019s bottled-up dream bills.\n\nBut that might not matter. One Republican aide summed it up this way: \u201cYou don\u2019t need the filibuster if you have the committees.\u201d Even a 51\u201349 Republican majority could vote down Obama nominees. Grassley would get to strike out judicial nominees; Alabama Sen. Richard Shelby, who successfully blocked a Nobel Prize nominee for the Fed, would have new sway over candidates for Treasury and the IRS. The safest nominee, paradoxically, might be a high-profile theoretical pick for the Supreme Court, because those fights rally the base and several Republicans will be fighting for new terms in blue states\u2014Illinois Sen. Mark Kirk, Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson, Pennsylvania Sen. Pat Toomey. It could be tight. Five Republican senators backed Obama\u2019s last Supreme Court nominee, Elena Kagan. Only two\u2014Sens. Lindsey Graham and Susan Collins\u2014remain.\n\nInvestigations\n\nPreventing some Democratic nominee from putting on judicial robes\u2014that could have repercussions for a generation. Two years of adversarial hearings would inflict a sharper, shorter kind of pain, mostly from, yes, Sen. Grassley. \u201cLet\u2019s get to the bottom of something that\u2019s been out there a long time\u2014Fast and Furious,\u201d Grassley told Politico this month for a story about how he and other ranking members might lead. \u201cLet\u2019s get to the bottom of [the] IRS.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe other chairmen-in-waiting sound less intense. Wisconsin\u2019s Sen. Johnson was the guy whose needling of Hillary Clinton about Benghazi deaths led her to utter the immortal (and usually misremembered) line \u201cWhat difference, at this point, does it make?\u201d If Sen. John McCain decides to take the Armed Services Committee, Johnson is set to run Homeland Security. Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker, a Syria and ISIS hawk, would take over Foreign Relations. Both say they\u2019re more interested in policy than show trials; both of them happen to be extraordinarily good at starting media show trials. We are talking about a Wisconsin senator whose own lawsuit against the ACA was dismissed just two months ago.\n\nObamacare\n\nEvery Republican senator and candidate knows that the Affordable Care Act passed in the budget reconciliation process, the only way to get a bill through without the threat of cloture. Every one of them thinks reconciliation can be used to gut it. \u201cI think we got something with this tax issue,\u201d McConnell reportedly told aides after the Supreme Court upheld Obamacare while defining its health care mandate as a tax. \u201cFigure out how to repeal this through reconciliation.\u201d\n\nMcConnell no longer talks like that in public. In a revealing interview with Politico\u2019s Manu Raju, McConnell walked through all of his 2015 priorities, all the ways they could be forced through in the budget process. He didn\u2019t promise to repeal Obamacare. He didn\u2019t even say that in a secret (then leaked) speech to a donor conference organized by the Kochs. The current plan is to use next year\u2019s budget process to chip away at the law by ending the medical device tax, or ending the employer mandate, and forcing the president to veto or accept it. Basically, look at what the health care industry wants to change, then expect Republicans to agree with it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nOf course, in the summer of 2013, \u201cthe plan\u201d was to avoid a fight over funding Obamacare. Conservatives in the House and Senate forced one, and forced a shutdown. Plenty of Democrats expect a shutdown next year, because Republicans seem to think they can \u201cwin one.\u201d Texas Sen. John Cornyn, who\u2019ll be majority whip if his party takes over, has said the blame for a government implosion shifts dramatically if a Republican House and Senate send a bill to the president\u2019s desk. That may have been disproved by the 1995\u20131996 shutdown, but the theory is unkillable.\n\n\u201cIf we take the Senate, we\u2019ve got to deal with Obamacare,\u201d says Texas Rep. Blake Farenthold, a Tea Party winner in 2010 who now holds a safe seat. \u201cRemember, Obamacare was done through the reconciliation process and only took 51 votes.\n\nIf we take the Senate, we\u2019ve got the opportunity to either repeal, replace, or fix Obamacare.\u201d\n\nEverything else\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nBeyond Obamacare, the theory goes that a Republican Senate can liberate all of the House GOP\u2019s bottled-up dream bills. There are hundreds of them, bill after bill that would cut taxes or drug-test welfare recipients or make it easier to file lawsuits against the executive branch. Some of these priorities, like the deathless bill to allow the Keystone XL pipeline, already might have 60 votes in the Senate. Eleven Democrats are on record wanting Keystone, though five of them are either retiring or on the watch list in this midterm\u2014Montana Sen. John Walsh, North Carolina Sen. Kay Hagan, Louisiana Sen. Mary Landrieu, Arkansas Sen. Mark Pryor, and Alaska Sen. Mark Begich.\n\nMcConnell, who alternates between promises of a \u201cworking Senate\u201d and Bond villain descriptions of how he\u2019ll bring down Obama, has insisted that a Republican Senate would be collaborative. His caucus has other ideas. Oklahoma Sen. James Inhofe, for one, was raring to use the Congressional Review Act to overturn environmental rules.\n\n\u201cProbably the very first thing to do is to go after the EPA regulations,\u201d said Inhofe. \u201cAs these rules go into effect, and they become final, on that day you can file a CRA. I\u2019m going to do that and go after them all.\u201d\n\nYet Inhofe had a problem with the question. He\u2019d been asked, hypothetically, how Republicans could govern if they won the Senate.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.subheadline": "How the Republicans would run the Senate.", "fb-share": "How the Republicans Would Run the Senate", "sailthru.author": "David Weigel", "description": "Rep.
