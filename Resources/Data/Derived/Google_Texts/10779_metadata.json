Then it started to rain and that wasn't bad. Then it started to pour and then it started to hail,\" Fairgoer Troy Taylor said.\n\nThe storm swept in late Sunday afternoon. All the rides shut down at the first sign of lightning.\n\nBecause the storm forced the fair to shut down early, they are honoring ride tickets at next year's fair. For all wristbands purchased Sunday, they will be issuing a voucher that can be redeemed for a wristband at next year's fair.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "Rain and hail forced the fair to shut down early, Sunday afternoon.", "language": "english", "author": "Parrish Alleman", "og": {"description": "Rain and hail forced the fair to shut down early, Sunday afternoon.", "title": "Heavy Rain Puts Damper On Last Day Of Kansas State Fair", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Heavy-Rain-Puts-Damper-On-Last-Day-Of-Kansas-State-Fair-223853181.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/iupl/9C0/251/9C02511A5F22448F946097A153C2E41C", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/151/D23/151D231706484C54AEF00D129C481451.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kake.com", "description": "Rain and hail forced the fair to shut down early, Sunday afternoon.", "title": "Heavy Rain Puts Damper On Last Day Of Kansas State Fair", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Heavy-Rain-Puts-Damper-On-Last-Day-Of-Kansas-State-Fair-223853181.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/State_fair_rain.jpg", "creator": "@KAKEnews", "site": "@KAKEnews", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Heavy Rain Puts Damper On Last Day Of Kansas State Fair", "google-site-verification": "H0mev8O__gMqb34WcvOyZgBXFMRQZvDAQ0YTSGJ9hGQ", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Heavy Rain Puts Damper On, Last Day Of Kansas State"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc794\"", "article_summary": "Because the storm forced the fair to shut down early, they are honoring ride tickets at next year's fair.\nSunday, September 15, 2013A thunderstorm in Hutchinson Sunday dropped heavy rains and hail right on top of fair-goers, forcing the fair to shut down a little early.\nFor all wristbands purchased Sunday, they will be issuing a voucher that can be redeemed for a wristband at next year's fair.\nThen it started to pour and then it started to hail,\" Fairgoer Troy Taylor said.\nThen it started to rain and that wasn't bad."}
