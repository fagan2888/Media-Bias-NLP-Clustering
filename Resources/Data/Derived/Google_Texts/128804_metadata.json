If I hadn\u2019t come in, I wouldn\u2019t have learned so much.\u201d\n\nThe recent USF session was one of a series of community outreach and enrollment events scheduled to help consumers learn more about their coverage options as the Jan. 31 deadline to enroll through the federal Health Insurance Marketplace approaches.\n\n\u201cNavigators\u201d and others who help people sign up for coverage under the ACA, President Barack Obama\u2019s signature legislative achievement, are out in force.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re coming down the home stretch,\u201d said Tampa Mayor Bob Buckhorn, a major ACA advocate. \u201cMost of the low fruit has been picked; now the target audiences that we\u2019re going after are a little bit tougher to reach \u2014 students, Hispanics, African-Americans. So we are really going to aggressively go after it these last two weeks and try to finish strong.\u201d\n\nBuckhorn has opened up city parks and rec centers during the ACA open enrollment period. There is a slew of additional events lined up for people to get help with the marketplace. USF\u2019s Florida Covering Kids & Families, the Florida Community Health Action Information Network (CHAIN) and the Family Health Care Foundation are all providing one-on-one assistance.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just about health insurance, it\u2019s about having access to health care, and a lot of people didn\u2019t have that before,\u201d said Jodi Ray, director of Florida Covering Kids & Families. \u201cIt\u2019s having that conversation, it\u2019s about people leaving with access to health care and services that they didn\u2019t have before.\u201d\n\nRay is riding a record of success in ACA enrollment.\n\nFlorida leads the nation in the third open-enrollment period since Obama signed the ACA into law. Nearly 1.6 million Floridians had signed up as of Jan. 9; Texas is the only other state with more than 1 million enrollees, with 1.1 million. In the Tampa Bay area, more than 260,000 have signed up.\n\nNationwide, 8.7 million consumers have signed-up for health coverage through the HealthCare.gov website or had their coverage automatically renewed.\n\nThe Florida numbers are particularly impressive because the Sunshine State has the nation\u2019s second-highest rate of uninsured residents younger than 65, with 3.8 million people, or about one-fifth of the population, without coverage.\n\n\u201cAs we get to the end of the third year, it\u2019s permeating at a public level where people are able to articulate (the ACA), they are less uninformed about what it is when we talk about the marketplace, people know who to call, they know that there\u2019s a choice,\u201d said Ray. \u201cI think the message is getting out there.\u201d\n\nIn September, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services announced a $5.9 million grant for the USF-led effort. That was the largest to a sign-up group in the country and brought USF\u2019s haul to $14.5 million in federal Navigator grants over the last three years.\n\nHHS reported that for the last open enrollment season, 93 percent of Florida consumers who were signed up qualified for an average tax credit of $294 per month through the marketplace. The agency said 72 percent of Florida enrollees obtained coverage for $100 or less after any applicable tax credits.\n\nThe math didn\u2019t work for Francesca Morea, a senior physics major who attended the recent USF navigator session after doctors pressed her to obtain insurance coverage. Subsidies in the form of tax credits are only available to applicants whose incomes fall between 100 percent and 400 percent of the federal poverty level, which is $11,770 for a single-person household.\n\nNot everyone\u2019s aware that you can be too broke to qualify.\n\n\u201cI just didn\u2019t qualify for anything I could afford,\u201d Morea said. She lives on student loans and financial aid that doesn\u2019t qualify as income.\n\nBut navigators at the event steered her toward the Hillsborough County Health Care Plan, a program that provides residents living at or below the poverty level access to health care. She said her navigator \u201cwas very nice, and very helpful.\u201d\n\nIf the uninsured need any more motivation to enroll, consider that the penalties for going bare continue to rise.\n\nFor 2016, the penalty assessed upon filing the federal tax return is $695 per adult or 2.5 percent of household income, whichever is higher, and $347.50 for each child under 18.\n\n\u201cIf you miss the deadline, you could possibly find yourself paying a lot of money for a penalty and getting nothing for that,\u201d said Ray. \u201cMost people were surprised to get hit with higher penalty. ... They\u2019re realizing it\u2019s not nearly that affordable.\u201d\n\nAdvocates have their own motivation for getting more people enrolled on the exchange. Tampa is one of 20 cities nationwide with high percentages of uninsured participating in the \u201cHealthy Communities Challenge.\u201d Obama has promised to visit the city that makes the most progress during open enrollment.\n\n\u201cI would love to win, just because I\u2019m so competitive, but I would like to win for the right reasons,\u201d said Buckhorn, who was invited to a White House reception for ACA proponents in 2014. \u201cI think it would be a great honor to have the president here.\u201d\n\nBuckhorn offered this advice to those sitting on the fence as the deadline approaches:\n\n\u201cThink about your families. Think about your quality of life, think about lifting that burden of that fear of having a catastrophic illness that you can\u2019t pay for. It makes all the sense in the world. It shouldn\u2019t be a Democratic or a Republican issue, it\u2019s all about giving people the opportunity to purchase health care on the marketplace and make sure their families are taken care of.\u201d\n\nNeed help?\n\nHere is a list of events where people in the Tampa Bay area can get one-on-one assistance with the Affordable Care Act enrollment process.
