Instead, the university made the decision to simply end its healthcare coverage for students.\n\n\u201cBowie State University has suspended offering health insurance for domestic students for the 2013-2014 academic year,\u201d said the university in a statement.\n\nThe bad news at Bowie undercuts Obama\u2019s assurances that his domestic policies are helping young people and African Americans. As recently as August, a spokesperson for the White House told reporters that Obama was committed to providing vigorous support for historically black colleges and their students, according to Campus Reform.\n\n\u201cThe President and this administration have been strong supporters of historically black colleges and universities all across the country,\u201d said Deputy Press Secretary Josh Earnest in a statement in August. \u201cFunding for those colleges and universities has increased under President Obama.\u201d\n\nCampus Reform Reporter Kat Timpf interviewed Bowie students about the Obamacare-related cancellation of their healthcare policies.
