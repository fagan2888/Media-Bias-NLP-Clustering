Can freedom exist in a vacuum?\n\nThe answer to these questions will direct the course we take as a culture and shape the type of society in which we will live. It is among the fundamental questions of our age.\n\nBecause we are often able to discern principles more clearly through parable, allow me to recount, in brief, G.K. Chesterton\u2019s short story \u201cThe Yellow Bird.\u201d\n\nSome time ago, a Professor Ivanhov, a Russian scholar and author of the book \u201cThe Psychology of Liberty,\u201d was a guest at a grand English house. He was a zealot for the ideas of liberty and emancipation \u2013 he was an avowed enemy of all limits and constraint.\n\nIn that ancient house lived a yellow canary, whose sound filled the halls with beautiful melodies. Discontented to see such beauty confined to a cage, Professor Ivanhov liberated the delicate creature from his abode. Once free, the canary fled to the forest where the wild animals reduced him to feathers and bones.\n\nIn that same grand house lived several goldfish. They happily swam in their bowl, content with their existence and the space they occupied. But the wise Professor Ivanhov, disgusted by their confinement, hurled the fishbowl to the floor, liberating the goldfish from their glass dwelling. The poor creatures flopped at his feet until they perished.\n\nBut that was not enough. Professor Ivanhov\u2019s dedication to freedom knew no bounds. He could not endure the necessary limits of human existence. Constrained by the sky above him, he endeavored to free himself, which he did by blowing-up the old house, taking himself with it. Freedom as last!\n\n\u201cWhat exactly is liberty?\u201d asks Gabriel Gale, a witness to Ivanhov\u2019s madness, and the character who represents Chesterton\u2019s narrative voice.\n\n\u201cFirst and foremost, surely, it is the power of a thing to be itself. In some ways the yellow bird was free in the cage. It was free to be alone. It was free to sing. In the forest its feathers would be torn to pieces and its voice choked forever. Then I began to think that being oneself, which is liberty, is itself limitation. We are limited by our brains and bodies; and if we break out, we cease to be ourselves, and, perhaps, to be anything.\u201d\n\nChesterton believed that unrestrained freedom was not freedom at all, but itself a form of servitude. Does that make freedom and liberty a bad thing? Is all liberty the equivalent of licentiousness?\n\nTo James Fitzjames Stephen, the great English jurist and legal scholar, \u201cthe question whether liberty is a good thing or a bad thing appears as irrational as the question whether fire is a good or a bad thing. It is both good and bad according to time, place, and circumstance, and a complete answer to the question, in what cases is liberty good and in what is it bad?, would involve not merely a universal history of mankind, but a complete solution of the problems which such a history would offer.\u201d\n\nThe lessons of the past century have taught us that it is ridiculous to tolerate every opinion in the name of an amorphous, abstract conception of liberty.\n\nShould discussion on the merits of antisemitism or radical Islam be treated with respect or accorded the weight of reasonableness? Hardly.\n\nBut despite the knowledge that some ideas and activities are existentially wrong, this does not mean that there must be fixed boundaries by which freedom and liberty ought to be judged. Liberty is not an abstract principle, but, as Aristotle and Aquinas believed, something that must be ordered to appropriate ends.\n\nWhen we indulge in limitless freedom, when we confuse liberty for license, when we consistently act upon our impulses with no fear of reproach, we unwittingly enable the construction of our own psychological and spiritual prisons. Whether it is overeating, drinking in excess, sexual permissiveness, taking what rightfully belongs to others, obsessing over material things, or engaging in any type of behavior without the slightest care of the consequences for ourselves or others, we ensnare ourselves in the shackles of delusion and self-destruction.\n\nSuch debauchery invariably leads to torment and loneliness. This is the reason why so many celebrities, the very people who seem to have it all, are plagued by self-inflicted tragedy.\n\nFreedom and liberty are important aspects of our humanity, but when they are viewed as abstract rights and utterly divorced from the realities of social, political, and economic circumstances, they become dreadful things. As the French Revolution taught, despotism is nourished in the soil of unlimited freedom. We embrace freedom as an abstract principal at the risk of perpetual serfdom.\n\nJust as the yellow canary was happy doing what he was made to do, so should we. Aristotle believed that men are social animals, and as such, must live among others in mutual cooperation. Our actions affect others; our ideas have far-reaching consequences. Thus, to be free, we must have structure, understand our duties, and seek the virtue that is to be found in everything. We exist for certain ends (the Greek telos), and the more we understand those ends and direct our lives to them, the more we can know true freedom.\n\nGlen A.
