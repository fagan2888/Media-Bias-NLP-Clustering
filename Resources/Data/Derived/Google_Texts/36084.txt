It was just after 10 o'clock Saturday night when Meridian police responded to the call about a Dollar Tree employee being robbed at gunpoint in the parking lot of the store in the Bonita area.

Det. Dareall Thompson says the employee told police they had just left the store when two males ran up and demanded money. The two suspects were described as wearing hoodies and having on different colored masks at the time of the robbery.

Police say the victim stated after the armed robbery happened, the suspects took off running on foot toward the back of the store. Investigators say there is a trail behind the store and that it was searched, but nothing turned up. Thompson says the suspects made away with the night deposit bag, which was full of cash.
