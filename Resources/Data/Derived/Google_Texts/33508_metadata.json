Groundwater Quality Standards.\n\nThe results did however show a low pH level of 5.93. Officials who gave the state test results said that the water pH is not uncommon in the area and may vary each time it is measured.\n\nThe following statement was released in regards to the community's concerns about the safety of the water:\n\n\"Belews Creek is one of the most efficient and well-equipped coal stations in the country. The vast majority of ash that is produced there is managed in a state-of-the-art lined landfill, not an ash basin. We have been monitoring groundwater near the ash basin for many years and have no reason for concern for neighboring drinking water wells. As we consider the best way to close the ash basin, we're evaluating options that will continue to protect groundwater and the neighboring community.\"\n\nThe group plans to meet every third Sunday at Forest Chapel Church on Pine Hall Road.", "article_metadata": {"description": "STOKES COUNTY, N.C. -- Neighbors of the Duke Energy Belews Creek Steam Station have health concerns for their water quality.
