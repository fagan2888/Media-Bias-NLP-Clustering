Rates are much higher in Western countries than in Africa or the Far East.\n\nTo analyze the possible effects of diet and gut bacteria, scientists from Imperial College and the University of Pittsburgh in the United States worked with a group of 20 African American volunteers and 20 from rural South Africa.\n\nIn the American group, two weeks on the African diet led to significantly less inflammation in the colon and reduced biomarkers of cancer risk.\n\nIn the African group, measurements of cancer risk dramatically increased after 14 days on the Western diet, with lots of food like meat and cheese.\n\n\"We can't definitively tell from these measurements that the change in their diet would have led to more cancer in the African group or less in the American group, but there is good evidence from other studies that the changes we observed are signs of cancer risk,\" said Nicholson.\n\nThe analysis found one of the main reasons for the risk changes was the way in which bacteria in the gut -- known as the microbiome -- changed their metabolism to adapt to the new diet.\n\nIn the American group, the African diet led to a rise in the production of butyrate, a by-product of fiber metabolism that has important anti-cancer effects, the researchers said.\n\n\"Africanization\" of the diet increased total quantities of butyrate in one measure by 2.5 times, while \"Westernization\" reduced quantities by half, they wrote in their study.\n\n(By Kate Kelland; Editing by Andrew Heavens)", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "us, african, diet, swap, has, dramatic, impact, colon, cancer, risk", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Black Americans who switched diets with rural Africans experienced a steep drop in risk factors for colon cancer, while the Africans saw their risks rise.", "title": "Junk Food Diets Have A Dramatic Impact On Colon Cancer Risk", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/us-african-diet-swap-has-dramatic-impact-colon-cancer-risk-331008", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/04/28/diet-swap.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Black Americans who switched diets with rural Africans experienced a steep drop in risk factors for colon cancer, while the Africans saw their risks rise.", "title": "Junk Food Diets Have A Dramatic Impact On Colon Cancer Risk", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/us-african-diet-swap-has-dramatic-impact-colon-cancer-risk-331008", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/04/28/diet-swap.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/04/28/diet-swap.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Vitality", "published_time": "2015-04-28T12:06:57-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-28T12:08:14-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Black Americans who switched diets with rural Africans experienced a steep drop in risk factors for colon cancer, while the Africans saw their risks rise."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfc18\"", "article_summary": "Researchers said they were not surprised that eating more fiber appeared to lower colon cancer risk, but were struck by how quickly and dramatically the effects showed.\nIn the American group, two weeks on the African diet led to significantly less inflammation in the colon and reduced biomarkers of cancer risk.\nColon cancer is the fourth deadliest form of the disease, killing more than 600,000 people a year.\nLONDON (Reuters) - Black Americans who switched to a high-fiber African diet for just two weeks saw a dramatic drop in risk factors for colon cancer, a study published on Tuesday found.\nIn the African group, measurements of cancer risk dramatically increased after 14 days on the Western diet, with lots of food like meat and cheese."}
