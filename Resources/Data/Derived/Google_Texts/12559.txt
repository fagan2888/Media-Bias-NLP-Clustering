Walton County Sheriff's officials spent Saturday morning cleaning up a meth lab "shake and bake" outside of a Wal-Mart.

Just after 9:00 a.m. Saturday morning, a Santa Rosa Beach Wal-Mart employee called law enforcement after seeing a water bottle filled with a foamy substance in the parking lot.

Deputies confirmed it was a "shake a bake," a method to mix chemicals to produce meth.

They said it had exploded in the parking lot but no one was hurt.

Officials with the Sheriff's Office say it's not an uncommon problem in Walton County, and it's one they're actively trying to combat.

"Just earlier this week we had three arrested and an infant taken out of a house after a search warrant of our narcotics unit. I think that if you don't know somebody doing it, you have a friend who has a family member that knows somebody doing it. We're trying to combat that," Walton County Sheriff's Office Public Affairs Coordinator, Corey Dobridnia said.

Deputies believe the person responsible bought the supplies in the store before trying to make it in the parking lot. They cleared the spill and reopened the small section of parking lot.

Dobridnia says no arrests have been made and there are no suspects at this time. Anyone with information can call the Sheriff's Office at 892-8111.
