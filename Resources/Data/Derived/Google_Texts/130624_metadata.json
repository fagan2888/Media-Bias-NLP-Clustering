According to him, it\u2019s all Obamacare\u2019s fault.\n\n\u201cThe straw that broke the camel\u2019s back was really the Affordable Care Act for us,\u201d Clay County Director of Schools Jerry Strong told the Greenfield Reporter, \u201cand it has made it very difficult for us to have our employees properly covered and meet the mandates of the law.\u201d\n\nStrong wants the County Commission to increase taxes to get the schools open again by November.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c[Obamacare] was going to require new revenue and the commission felt like they couldn\u2019t do that through a tax increase.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with FOX 17, Strong called Obamacare \u201ca totally unfunded mandate.\u201d\n\nSponsored\n\nCounty Commissioner Parrish Wright says the schools, which have been struggling with budget issues for three years, actually have enough money to stay open through the academic year. A wheel tax referendum comes up for a vote in March, and if it doesn\u2019t pass, officials will still have the same options they have right now.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to hurt a lot of people,\u201d Wright said of the school closure, \u201cEither way it goes, Clay County has lost. Nobody\u2019s won.\u201d\n\nHe argues that Clay is a \u201cpoor, rural county,\u201d and property taxes there are already high by Tennessee standards, so taxing vehicle registration is a better option.\n\nTwo students have filed a lawsuit that will be heard Monday, Oct. 19, and a judge has issued an injunction to delay the school closures. Schools are closed this week anyway, for the regular fall break.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe state mandates 180 days of instruction, so the students at the county\u2019s three schools will likely have to make up the closure days at the end of the school year.\n\n[h/t Daily Beast, Screengrab of Jerry Strong via Fox17]", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "School&#39;s Out Forever, Thanks Obama, Schools, Tennessee, Gawker", "author": "Jay Hathaway", "og": {"site_name": "Gawker", "description": "One small county in Tennessee is running out of money, and its Director of Schools has taken it upon himself to address the problem by closing all schools in the middle of the academic year, affecting more than 1,100 students.
