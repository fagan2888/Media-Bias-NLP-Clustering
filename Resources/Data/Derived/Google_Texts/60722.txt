The collection of Nuggets at Pepsi Center during pre-draft workouts has grown by the session the past two weeks. Thursday, guard Nate Robinson was added to the group.

Robinson, rehabbing a torn anterior cruciate ligament, said he is still on track to be ready for training camp. He’s not doing any basketball-related activities now other than some shooting on the side. He anticipates that changing this summer.

“Hopefully August,” Robinson said of his return. “I’m trying to sway the doctors to give me a little more leeway.”

Robinson smiled while saying that. He knows speeding up the timeline on his rehab process probably won’t happen, and he’s fine with that. When he returns, he wants to be back to fully with no restrictions, and though the 5-foot-9 mighty mite is revved up and ready to go right now, he also wants to have no setbacks.

“For me it’s just, I can’t really wait to play,” Robinson said. “It’s been a long time.”

Robinson, who last played Jan. 29, is one of three Denver players dealing with ACL injuries. J.J. Hickson and Danilo Gallinari are the others.

Footnotes. The Nuggets conducted their latest pre-draft workouts Thursday, putting Clemson forward K.J. Daniels and Delaware forward Davon Usher through the paces. Earlier in the week, the Nuggets traveled to see Michigan guard Nik Stauskas and Creighton forward Doug McDermott, a three-time consensus All-American. … The Nuggets might have one more workout before the NBA draft next Thursday.
