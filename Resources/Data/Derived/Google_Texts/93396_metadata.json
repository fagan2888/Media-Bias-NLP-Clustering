But now that Republican sniping is in full effect, officials in the West Wing are, as Greg Sargent noted this morning, \u201c placing its bet on Da Crazy .\u201d\n\nGreg added, \u201cThat is to say, White House officials are bracing for months of assaults on Obama\u2019s handling of the swap, but they believe the Conservative Entertainment Complex will veer into over the top attacks that will alienate the broader public, which won\u2019t see the basics of the situation in such lurid terms.\u201d\n\nIf that is the plan, Obama administration officials won\u2019t have to wait too long for \u201cDa Crazy.\u201d Indeed, it\u2019s already here\n\nTexas Gov. Rick Perry (R) suggested the recovery of U.S. Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl was done to distract people from the Veterans Affairs controversy\u2026. Perry suggested the trade was done to distract from a controversy involving delays in healthcare for military veterans. \u201cHere\u2019s the bigger concern for me, and I really would like for somebody to take a look at this and answer it \u2013 was this done to take the VA off the front page of the newspapers? An absolute debacle that we\u2019ve seen this administration not taking care of the men and women of our military, and this kind of happened all of a sudden it seems like,\u201d Perry said during an appearance on Fox News\u2019 \u201cHannity.\u201d\n\nPerry added that his conspiracy theory is \u201creally troubling,\u201d which is an assessment I\u2019m inclined to agree with for entirely different reasons.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, it\u2019s not just the Texas governor \u2013 Rep. Tim Griffin (R-Ark.), himself a former military veteran, also suspects administration officials agreed to the prisoner swap as an elaborate ruse to distract the public.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting a couple of relevant details that Perry and Griffin may not be aware of. First, the diplomatic process that freed Bergdahl was initiated years ago (before the VA scandal was on front pages), and picked up speed months ago (also before the VA scandal was on front pages). To plan this as a distraction ploy, the White House would need a time machine.\n\nSecond, following Shinseki\u2019s resignation, much of the political world had already begun to shift its attention away from the VA scandal, suggesting that if this were the White House\u2019s motivation \u2013 it wasn\u2019t, but we\u2019re playing along with the nonsense for a moment \u2013 it didn\u2019t need an elaborate international scheme involving multiple countries talking over several years.\n\nSo why in the world would far-right policymakers say stuff like this?\n\nBecause it appears that for many Republicans, the conspiracy-theory reflex is uncontrollable. For quite a while, every development in every area was seen as a distraction from Benghazi. Or maybe the IRS \u201ccontroversy.\u201d Or perhaps \u201cFast and Furious.\u201d Or healthcare.gov\u2019s two-month troubles.\n\nThe idea of simply evaluating developments on their merits is too difficult. It\u2019s easier to see just about everything through a \u201cthere must be a conspiracy in here somewhere\u201d lens. In the immortal words of Rep. Pete Sessions (R-Texas), if Democrats believe Republicans are on a witch hunt, \u201c that must mean there is a witch somewhere .\u201d\n\n\u201cDa Crazy\u201d is only going to get worse. Dana Milbank\u2019s latest is a gem.\n\nRep. Buck McKeon displayed the probing intellect this week that we expect from a chairman of the House Armed Services Committee. Commenting on Fox News Channel about the prisoner swap with the Taliban that sprung U.S. Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, the California Republican explained why he plans to hold hearings on the matter. \u201cIt really is kind of ironic, because this is kind of playing out much like Benghazi,\u201d he said, \u201cwhere they kind of do or don\u2019t do something, and uh, and then kind of come up with a story afterward of why they did or didn\u2019t do something. This is really mind-boggling.\u201d So the prisoner exchange in Afghanistan is \u201cmuch like\u201d the 2012 attacks on U.S. facilities in Libya because, in both cases, the administration did or didn\u2019t do something and then later gave an account of why it did or didn\u2019t do that something. Scandalous.\n\nRemember, McKeon is not some random pundit saying dumb things on Fox; he\u2019s the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "The White House expects the right to go too far with Bergdahl allegations, alienating the American mainstream.
