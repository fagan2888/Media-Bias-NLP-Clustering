Now, as the Supreme Court prepares to hear a second challenge to the president\u2019s health care law, Mr. Roberts has an opportunity for another redo that could fix a far greater debacle featuring the chief justice and the chief executive.\n\nThe public face plant of the two Ivy Leaguers surprised adoring elitists who make it their business to fawn over academic and professional credentials.\n\nMr. Obama, the first African-American president of the Harvard Law Review, boasted \u201ca movie-star smile and more than a little mystique,\u201d gushed the Chicago Sun-Times. He was called the \u201cgreatest orator of his generation\u201d with the \u201crhetorical skill\u201d and \u201cability to captivate and inspire audiences with his powerful speeches,\u201d cooed the BBC. He had been elected on a \u201cgreat flame of ambition and excitement,\u201d said Piers Morgan. He was \u201cthe next messiah,\u201d according to Barbara Walters.\n\nFor his own part, Mr. Obama was no less impressed. \u201cWe are the ones we\u2019ve been waiting for,\u201d he had announced, \u201cWe are the change that we seek.\u201d The moment of his nomination in 2008, he said, was \u201cthe moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal.\u201d\n\nThe chief justice, too, had his own unnatural talents. Planet-healing does not appear on Mr. Roberts\u2019s resume, but his curriculum vitae still includes enough accomplishments to choke a horse. As a 13-year-old prep school applicant, he wrote, \u201cI won\u2019t be content to get a good job by getting a good education, I want to get the best job by getting the best education.\u201d\n\nMr. Roberts went on to become the youngest chief justice since John Marshall. Along the way, he racked up one achievement after another, including top honors from Harvard College and Harvard Law School. During his Senate confirmation hearings, even Democrats acknowledged that Mr. Roberts was \u201cbrilliant, talented and well qualified,\u201d and one senator recognized him as \u201cthe finest appellate lawyer of your generation.\u201d\n\nSo what happened when the perfect president-elect and the perfect chief justice took the dais on that perfect Inauguration Day for the oath of office prescribed in the constitutional text?\n\nNothing short of an oratorical slow-motion train wreck.\n\nOne of the largest global audiences in history tuned in to witness what the Associated Press called \u201cthe flub heard around the world.\u201d Mr. Roberts led off, working without notes. Mr. Obama interrupted Roberts in the opening line. The chief justice then rearranged the oath\u2019s wording, which seemed to throw Mr. Obama off, and he stopped abruptly. Mr. Roberts attempted to correct himself by repeating a botched phrase. Then the president-elect repeated the original,\n\nincorrect version. The inhabitants of our still-healing planet collectively cringed.\n\nAfter Mr. Obama finished his bungled oath, Michelle Obama gave him a raised eyebrow. Legal experts raised eyebrows as well, questioning whether the flawed recital had indeed vested Mr. Obama with presidential authority. As a result, Messrs. Roberts and Obama met again later for a constitutional do-over in which the president recited the oath properly, as required.\n\nNow, another constitutional do-over is imminent as the Supreme Court prepares to hear arguments in King v. Burwell. The case involves a statutory challenge to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, more commonly known as ObamaCare.\n\nThree years ago, as everyone remembers, Mr. Obama the former constitutional law professor lectured the justices that they could not possibly overturn his law. \u201cI am confident,\u201d he said, \u201cthat the Supreme Court will not take what would be an unprecedented, extraordinary step of overturning a law that was passed by a strong majority of a democratically elected Congress.\u201d\n\nSoon afterward, Mr. Obama got his wish. Mr. Roberts cast the deciding vote to uphold ObamaCare, explaining in an illogical muddle of an opinion why the Constitution permitted Congress for the first time in the history of the Republic to require every citizen to purchase a product. Many legal observers consider Mr. Roberts\u2019s decision an epic failure that makes the \u201cflub heard around the world\u201d seem trivial by comparison.\n\nIn the pending case, the challengers argue that the Internal Revenue Service exceeded its legal authority by making tax subsidies available to those who buy medical insurance policies on the federal exchanges established in 34 states, contrary to the statute\u2019s text limiting the subsidies to those who purchase policies on state exchanges.\n\nAs written, the statute provides that \u201cif you\u2019re a state and you don\u2019t set up an exchange, that means your citizens don\u2019t get their tax credits,\u201d according to ObamaCare architect Jonathan Gruber. If so, the millions who bought insurance on federal exchanges will lose their tax subsidies, the pool of insureds will shrink, premiums will balloon, and \u2014 the prediction goes \u2014 ObamaCare will collapse under its own weight.\n\nAs the Court prepares to hear oral arguments in King v. Burwell, all eyes once again are on Messrs. Roberts and Obama and the outcome of a far more significant constitutional do-over.\n\nGayle Trotter is an attorney and writer.", "article_metadata": {"description": "As the Court prepares to hear oral arguments in King v.
