She learned of her breast cancer diagnosis in June of 2015.\n\n\u201cIt was in several different areas of one side so I had a lot of decisions to make,\u201d Bennett said.\n\nBennett had a bilateral mastectomy after pre-cancerous cells were discovered in the other side.\n\nHer second surgery set for December couldn't be scheduled because she lost her Medicaid the month before in November.\n\nBennett was referred to Ohio's Breast and Cervical Cancer Project (BCCP); which provides cancer screenings, diagnostic testing and case management services at no cost to eligible women, who for some reason cannot get Medicaid.\n\nThe Missions team at Komen Columbus calls it a critical safety net.\n\n\u201cImagine a woman has an abnormal test and has to make a decision about feeding her kids or paying her rent or having a biopsy to find out if she actually has cancer.\u201d Julie McMahon, Missions Director at Komen Columbus said. \u201cThere are a lot of people who are working hard and have insurance but still are very low income and the cost of having a follow up test isn\u2019t covered by their insurance and so this would allow them to use that program.\u201d\n\nThe 2015 Review of Ohio Department of Health treatment programs shows enrollment peaked in 2010 and has been dropping since.\n\nThe report also cites the Affordable Care Act (ACA) for having had a significant impact on this program, helping to eliminate the gap BCCP was created to fill.\n\nState Senator Peggy Lehner from Montgomery County is leading a push to preserve and modernize the program with legislation to expand coverage to include diagnostic testing after routine screenings, expanded access to women as young as 25. Right now it's closed to women under 40 and it would expand the income eligibility.\n\nWomen\u2019s health advocates call it a smart move that would bring the program current and make it more effective.\n\n\u201cOne of the great things is that for every dollar put into this program which Ohio only puts about $800 into this program we get three dollars from the CDC to help fight breast cancer and cervical cancer in Ohio,\u201d McMahon said.\n\nMeantime Bennett's fight continues with a relaunch of this \u201cGo Fund Me\u201d page to help as she says she\u2019s paying high insurance premiums and high deductibles for her next surgery.\n\nShe told 10TV she was denied entry to the Breast and Cervical Cancer Project because she wasn\u2019t enrolled prior to her diagnosis and she's younger than 40.\n\nDespite her experience, Bennett believes the program still has a place.\n\n\"I think if they change the requirements more women could use it because it was frustrating for me because I needed it and couldn't use it,\" she said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ohio's Breast and Cervical Cancer Project which provides cancer screenings, diagnostic testing and case management services at no cost to eligible women, who for some reason cannot get Medicaid.", "og": {"site_name": "WBNS-10TV Columbus, Ohio", "description": "Ohio's Breast and Cervical Cancer Project which provides cancer screenings, diagnostic testing and case management services at no cost to eligible women, who for some reason cannot get Medicaid.", "title": "Lawmaker wants to change breast & cervical cancer project", "url": "http://www.10tv.com/content/stories/2016/04/14/columbus-ohio-lawmaker-wants-to-change-breast--cervical-cancer-project.html", "image": "http://www.10tv.com/content/videos/2016/04/14/bccp-legislation-.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 100480996669326}, "dfp-id": 8919, "dfp-adunit": "10TV_ROS/10TV_Lifestyles-Entertainment/10TV_Health", "google-site-verification": "oAfV5ExqDpMG7IN3s-onYSMOZYzGcQsWBAOUMvXCw_c", "dfp-targeting": "{\"cat\":[\"news\",\"life-ent\",\"health\"]}"}, "article_summary": "She learned of her breast cancer diagnosis in June of 2015.\nShe told 10TV she was denied entry to the Breast and Cervical Cancer Project because she wasn\u2019t enrolled prior to her diagnosis and she's younger than 40.\nBennett was referred to Ohio's Breast and Cervical Cancer Project (BCCP); which provides cancer screenings, diagnostic testing and case management services at no cost to eligible women, who for some reason cannot get Medicaid.\n\u201cOne of the great things is that for every dollar put into this program which Ohio only puts about $800 into this program we get three dollars from the CDC to help fight breast cancer and cervical cancer in Ohio,\u201d McMahon said.\nThey are the words no one wants to hear: You have cancer."}
