Republicans have attacked the law since its 2010 passage, and Democrats criticized the suit, announced by Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine, a Republican, before he and Warren County officials held their news conference this morning to announce it.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Columbus and joined by the Ohio Department of Administrative Services, the University of Akron, Bowling Green State University, Shawnee State University and Youngstown State University, does not attempt to knock out the Affordable Care Act, or ACA, directly. But like another case, this one pending before the U.S. Supreme Court, it represents a potential chipping away of the ACA's foundation and the manner in which the law \u2013 requiring most Americans to get health insurance \u2013 is financed.\n\n\"This tax assessment by the Obama Administration is an unprecedented attempt to destroy the balance of authority between the federal government and the states,\" said DeWine, whose office filed the lawsuit. \"The $5.3 million Ohio is being taxed is money that could be used for education, public safety, and roads and bridges. The states are not the federal government's tax collectors, and the Obama administration should refund these illegal taxes immediately.\"\n\nUnder the ACA, the \"tax,\" which the Obama administration calls a \"fee,\" must be paid by nearly all health insurers, including the plans of employers who provide group coverage for their workers. It comes to $63 per covered person in the first year, and is used primarily to fund a reinsurance pool.\n\nReinsurance protects insurance companies from losses if they estimate their premiums and costs incorrectly and face losses.\n\nCongressional Democrats who wrote the ACA, and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services under Obama, which championed and implemented it, wanted a reinsurance fund for 2014, 2015 and 2016 in case health insurance carriers underestimated the medical costs they'd incur for new clients.\n\nIndividual premiums on the ACA's marketplace were to be based on underwriting standards accepted by the insurance industry and state and federal regulators, but Obamacare was brand new -- and the parties wanted to be sure that insurers weren't wiped out financially if their estimates turned out wrong.\n\nReinsurance is a standard tool in the insurance industry. But in this case, the ACA \"Transitional Reinsurance Program\" was funded not only through the premiums of people participating in the ACA's new insurance marketplace, in which individual health insurance policies are purchased one at a time. Rather, the fee also had to be paid by employer group insurance plans \u2013 that is, by the people already providing insurance to their workers. That included state and local governments and public universities, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS.\n\nThe fee was levied on all employer-provided group plans, regardless of whether the employer was self-insured or used an outside insurer such as Aetna or Medical Mutual. Partial payments for the 2014 calendar year were due earlier this month. A small number of group plans will be exempted for the 2015 and 2016 calendar years, and the fee will go down for those who still must pay.\n\nIn addition to paying for the reinsurance program, a portion of the fee goes to the Treasury to pay for another ACA feature, called the Early Retiree Reinsurance Program. (A full explanation of how the fees and programs work, and of the rationale behind today's legal challenge, can be found here.)\n\nThe state, local governments and state universities recently paid the fee to the federal government rather than run afoul of the law. But they were displeased about it, questioning its legality.\n\nAmong other things, DeWine's office says that when Congress wrote the ACA, it used language that HHS should have interpreted as restricting the reinsurance fee to private-sector employers -- and exempting the public sector. This is a matter of legal dispute. When the Northeast Ohio Media Group recently asked Timothy Jost, a law professor at Washington and Lee University and an authority on Obamacare, about this, he reviewed the statutes and disagreed with DeWine.\n\nIt will be up to the courts to decide whether DeWine, the universities and Warren County are right -- and whether their money should be returned.\n\nBesides the $5.389 million paid by the state, the University of Akron recently paid $325,584 to the federal government, while Bowling Green paid $275,247, Youngstown State paid $108,527 and Shawnee State paid $56,007, according to the lawsuit. Warren County paid $94,710.\n\nThe federal government allowed employers to pay the 2014 fee in two installments, with the biggest due this month, so some of these employers have another payment for 2014 due later this year. Warren County, for example, will have paid $113,904 altogether when it makes its second installment. Withholding the fee and litigating first was not an option because failure to pay could have required a fine of $100 a day for each person covered in the county's health plan, or $180,800 a day, the county said.\n\nThe universities, DeWine and Warren County Commission president David Young raised other grounds on which they challenged the fee. The fee is unfair because, they say, the federal government may not impose a tax on state and local governments. The lawsuit says that the \"tax\" violates federalism protections in the Constitution, including the Tenth Amendment, which helps define the relationship between the federal and state governments, the related anti-commandeering doctrine, and the doctrine of intergovernmental tax immunity.\n\n\"It is not my role to question the ACA or its merits but it is my responsibility to protect the funds of the taxpayers I represent,\" Young said. \"This action simply protects a tradition as old as our republic that governments do not tax each other. The principle of no taxation without representation is something our country was founded on.\"\n\nLeaving open the possibility of more local governments signing onto the case, Young said, \"I call on all other affected state and local officials to join us in our stand against this unconstitutional seizing of taxpayer funds regardless of their political party.\"\n\nThe lead attorneys in the lawsuit are DeWine, Warren County Prosecutor David Fornshell, and Kyle Duncan, a Washington, D.C. attorney who was lead counsel in the Hobby Lobby challenge to Obamacare last year.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court ruled that Hobby Lobby, which is family owned, could not be forced under Obamacare to provide contraceptives that violate the owners' religious beliefs.\n\nThe Supreme Court in March will hear a different case that challenges the taxpayer subsidies that help individuals in most states afford their ACA premiums. That case, based on the ACA's specific wording, could affect whether the federal government can legally provide subsidies in states that failed to set up their own ACA marketplaces. Ohio is one of those states, although DeWine is not involved directly in that case.\n\nHHS has not commented on today's lawsuit directly but told the Northeast Ohio Media Group on Friday that the reinsurance program and related measures were intended to \"help keep premiums affordable from year to year, and we saw that from 2014 to 2015, premiums remained affordable.\"\n\n\"Eighty percent of Marketplace enrollees as of December 2014 could obtain coverage for $100 or less after tax credits in 2015,\" HHS said in a statement. \"With 25 percent more issuers participating in the Marketplace this year, new choices and more competition are giving consumers affordable options.\"\n\nThe Warren County Democratic Party issued a statement today in advance of DeWine's news conference announcing the lawsuit. It said, \"We believe that the real intent of our Republican state and county leaders is to score political points by attacking the Affordable Care Act. The cost of this program is minimal, approximately 92 cents per Warren County resident per year... The real question is, how much will Warren County spend to fight this unnecessary legal battle, led by Attorney General Mike DeWine?\"\n\nNotably absent from the lawsuit was Ohio State University. Asked if it DeWine had asked it to join the case, a spokeswoman said Tuesday night, \"Ohio State was contacted by the Ohio Attorney General's Office last week and invited to consider joining the lawsuit. The university has not yet completed its analysis on whether or not to join.\"", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "mike-dewine,obamacare,reinsurance", "title": "Ohio, several state universities sue Obama administration over Obamacare 'tax'", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Ohio, several state universities sue Obama administration over Obamacare \\u0027tax\\u0027\", \"link\": \"http://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/2015/01/ohio_several_state_universitie.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.cleveland.com/home/cleve-media/width620/img/cleveland-homepage-images/photo/obama-sotu-328jpg-64730b81c5deec73.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"15053658\", \"pub_date\": \"2015-01-26T16:39:05Z\", \"author\": \"Stephen Koff, Northeast Ohio Media Group Washington Bureau Chief\", \"tags\": [\"@frontpage\",\"@mobile\",\"mike-dewine\",\"obamacare\",\"reinsurance\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.cleveland.com/cleveland-homepage-images/photo/16821336-thumb_square_large.jpg", "creator": "@SteveKoff", "description": "They claim the reinsurance fee charged to all employer-funded health plans cannot be charged to state and local governments.", "card": "summary", "site": "@clevelanddotcom"}, "article_date_updated": "Tuesday, January 27, 2015, 10:40 AM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"image_url\": \"http://media.cleveland.com/cleveland-homepage-images/photo/obama-sotu-328jpg-64730b81c5deec73.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"skoff\", \"author_nickname\": \"Stephen Koff, Northeast Ohio Media Group Washington Bureau Chief\", \"author_id\": \"2490\", \"source_blog_name\": \"OPEN: Ohio Politics\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "cleveland.com", "description": "They claim the reinsurance fee charged to all employer-funded health plans cannot be charged to state and local governments.", "title": "Ohio, several state universities sue Obama administration over Obamacare 'tax'", "url": "http://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/2015/01/ohio_several_state_universitie.html", "image": "http://media.cleveland.com/design/alpha/img/logo_cleve.gif", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "cleveland.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Monday, January 26, 2015, 11:38 AM", "article_author": "Stephen Koff, Northeast Ohio Media Group Washington Bureau Chief", "Description": "They claim the reinsurance fee charged to all employer-funded health plans cannot be charged to state and local governments."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbc6d\"", "article_summary": "WASHINGTON, D.C. \u2013 The state of Ohio, several state universities and a county in southwest Ohio are suing President Barack Obama's administration over what they say is an unconstitutional tax baked into the Affordable Care Act.\nThe states are not the federal government's tax collectors, and the Obama administration should refund these illegal taxes immediately.\"\nWarren County paid $94,710.\nThe real question is, how much will Warren County spend to fight this unnecessary legal battle, led by Attorney General Mike DeWine?\"\nNotably absent from the lawsuit was Ohio State University."}
