Tuition and fees for in-state residents at public colleges in the United States have increased more than 40 percent since 2004.\n\nThe Clinton college affordability plan will be funded by capping the value of itemized deductions that wealthy families can receive from tax returns.\n\nClinton wants to create a $150 billion refinancing plan for those who are struggling with debt, as the U.S. student loan debt is more than $1.2 trillion and about eight million people are defaulting. She hopes Congress will approve proposals for borrowers to refinance loans at the current federal rate.\n\nThe proposals will be first unveiled during a campaign stop in Exeter, N.H., and then throughout the week.\n\nPlans also include the expansion of the AmeriCorps national service program, which Clinton hopes to grow from 75,000 members to 250,000 by allowing certain students to graduate from college without incurring debt if they join.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hillary Clinton is planning to unveil a $350 billion plan to help students pay tuition without needing to take out loans and to help students already indebted.", "og": {"site_name": "UPI", "description": "Hillary Clinton is planning to unveil a $350 billion plan to help students pay tuition without needing to take out loans and to help students already indebted.", "title": "Hillary Clinton unveils $350B plan allowing students to graduate without debt", "url": "http://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2015/08/10/Hillary-Clinton-unveils-350B-plan-allowing-students-to-graduate-without-debt/4981439207139/", "image": "http://cdnph.upi.com/sv/ph/og/upi/4981439207139/2015/1/ac272724cc245e2ce250cb800a87d448/v2.1/Hillary-Clinton-unveils-350B-plan-allowing-students-to-graduate-without-debt.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Hillary Clinton is planning to unveil a $350 billion plan to help students pay tuition without needing to take out loans and to help students already indebted.", "title": "Hillary Clinton unveils $350B plan allowing students to graduate without debt", "image": "http://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/4981439207139/2015/upi/ac272724cc245e2ce250cb800a87d448/v2.1/Hillary-Clinton-unveils-350B-plan-allowing-students-to-graduate-without-debt.jpg?lg=4", "creator": "@AVPLive9", "site": "@UPI", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 130795020312660}, "keywords": "Top Stories, U.S., Hillary Clinton", "google-site-verification": "vnkcuJA1Q89cLmy4OZpuQKOf5Jf6ny_RVh7BpxZ11a0", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Top Stories, U.S., Hillary Clinton"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb633\"", "article_summary": "The Clinton college affordability plan will be funded by capping the value of itemized deductions that wealthy families can receive from tax returns.\nTuition and fees for in-state residents at public colleges in the United States have increased more than 40 percent since 2004.\nPlans also include the expansion of the AmeriCorps national service program, which Clinton hopes to grow from 75,000 members to 250,000 by allowing certain students to graduate from college without incurring debt if they join.\nEXETER, N.H., Aug. 10 (UPI) -- Hillary Clinton on Monday is planning to unveil a $350 billion presidential campaign plan to help students pay tuition at public colleges without needing to take out loans and to help students already indebted.\nClinton wants to create a $150 billion refinancing plan for those who are struggling with debt, as the U.S. student loan debt is more than $1.2 trillion and about eight million people are defaulting."}
