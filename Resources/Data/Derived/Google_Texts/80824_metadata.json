Talk about getting health insurance. #GetTalking.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nAnd, sure enough, Pajama Boy is wearing pajamas\u2014a zip-up onesie in classic Lamar Alexander plaid\u2014and drinking hot chocolate. He is in his twenties, sporting hipster glasses he could have bought at Warby Parker and an expression of self-satisfied ironic amusement.\n\nPajama Boy is about as threatening as Michael Cera and so nerdy he could guest-host on an unwatched MSNBC show. He is probably reading The Bell Jar and looking forward to a hearty Christmas meal of stuffed tofurkey. If he has anything to say about it, Obamacare enrollments will spike in the next few weeks in Williamsburg and Ann Arbor.\n\nPerhaps the goal of OFA was to create a readily mockable image to draw attention to its message, in which case Pajama Boy was a brilliantly successful troll. The right immediately Photoshopped him into the Mandela funeral selfie and emblazoned his photo with derisive lines like, \u201cHey girl, I live with my parents,\u201d and, \u201cHow did you know I went to Oberlin?\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s hard not to see Pajama Boy as an expression of the Obama vision, just like his forbear Julia, the Internet cartoon from the 2012 campaign. Pajama Boy is Julia\u2019s little brother. She progressed through life without any significant family or community connections. He is the picture of perpetual adolescence. Neither is a symbol of self-reliant, responsible adulthood.\n\nAnd so both are ideal consumers of government. Julia needed the help of Obama-supported programs at every juncture of her life, and Pajama Boy is going to get his health insurance through Obamacare ( another image shows him looking very pleased in a Christmas sweater, together with the words \u201cAnd a happy New Year with health insurance\u201d).", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO Magazine", "description": "Opinion: The latest effort to promote Obamacare is just a picture of perpetual adolescence.", "title": "Pajama Boy, An Insufferable Man-Child", "url": "http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2013/12/opinion-rich-lowry-obamacare-affordable-care-act-pajama-boy-an-insufferable-man-child-101304.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2013/12/18/131218_lowry_pajamaboy.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Obama For America (11),Opinion,HealthCare.Gov (214),Obamacare (1196)", "twitter": {"site": "@politicomag", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politicomag"}, "description": "Opinion: The latest effort to promote Obamacare is just a picture of perpetual adolescence.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7ea8\"", "article_summary": "Opinion Pajama Boy, An Insufferable Man-Child Pajama Boy, An Insufferable Man-ChildPajama Boy\u2019s place in Internet infamy was secured as soon as the insufferable man-child was tweeted out by Organizing for America.\n#GetTalking.\u201dStory Continued BelowAnd, sure enough, Pajama Boy is wearing pajamas\u2014a zip-up onesie in classic Lamar Alexander plaid\u2014and drinking hot chocolate.\nPajama Boy is about as threatening as Michael Cera and so nerdy he could guest-host on an unwatched MSNBC show.\nPerhaps the goal of OFA was to create a readily mockable image to draw attention to its message, in which case Pajama Boy was a brilliantly successful troll.\nPajama Boy is Julia\u2019s little brother."}
