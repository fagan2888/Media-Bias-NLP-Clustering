If you are looking to do a little shopping after the Thanksgiving holiday, the DeFuniak Springs Hometown Christmas Show is one place to check out.

The event is hosted by the DeFuniak Business and Professional Association, and this will be the 25th year for the event.

It started in the downtown area to help benefit the businesses, but because of rain and cooler temperatures the past few years, the event has been moved to the fairgounds on Highway 83.

The event features a number of craft vendors from all over the panhandle, and surrounding states.

There is also entertainment, which this year is being funded by Waste Management.

And of course Santa will be there to visit with all the kids.

"It is a really great event, like I said it has been going on for 25 years, and it is one of the longest running in the panhandle, and we are really proud of that. And the money we make from the crafters, we don't charge adminission at all, but the money we make from the crafters goes to funding the 4th of July celebration here in DeFuniak Springs and north Walton," said Sara Comander of the DBPA.

Comander says this event is a great way to support the local DeFuniak Springs economy and businesses.

The event will take place the Saturday Novemeber, 29th at 9 a.m.
