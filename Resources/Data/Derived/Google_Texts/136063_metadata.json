In 2011, he and his wife were paying Anthem a combined premium of about $2,400 each month and had individual deductibles of $1,500.\n\nWith the mid-year change, Taub and his wife saw their deductibles rise to $1,750.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like you\u2019re playing a game and you think you\u2019re at the goal, and they move the goal post another 10 yards,\u201d says Taub.\n\nAnthem argued that its contracts allowed for mid-year increases, as long as it provided proper notice of the changes.\n\nTaub\u2019s suit and another case were combined into one class action. After extensive negotiations, the two sides agreed to settle. Anthem agreed to no longer make mid-year alterations to individual customers\u2019 plans, unless a change in law or regulation supports such modifications. As part of the deal, Anthem does not admit to wrongdoing.\n\n\u201cAnthem should be commended for listening to the heartfelt concerns of its policyholders,\u201d Jerry Flanagan, lead attorney for plaintiffs\u2019 co-counsel Consumer Watchdog, said in a statement. \u201cThis settlement gives consumers the peace-of-mind of knowing that their \u2018annual\u2019 out-of-pocket costs won\u2019t change in the middle of the year.\u201d\n\nAnthem issued a statement saying it \u201cis pleased that all parties were able to come to an agreement.\u201d\n\nThe Anthem members who saw their costs rise due to the 2011 plan changes do not need to file a claim to receive their part of the $8.3 million refund. Checks will be mailed to them in December, according to Consumer Watchdog.\n\nThe settlement is tentative pending Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Jane Johnson\u2019s final approval.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Two class-action lawsuits charged Anthem with breach of contract after it raised deductibles and out-of-pocket limits mid-year in 2011.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Anthem Blue Cross Will Repay $8.3 Million to 50,000 California Customers\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2015\\/10\\/28\\/anthem-blue-cross-will-repay-8-3-million-to-50000-california-customers\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-10-28 09:29:06\",\"mod_date\":\"2015-10-28 10:27:59\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":99417,\"author_id\":\"8344\",\"author_name\":\"State of Health\",\"author_display_name\":\"State of Health\",\"tags\":[\"Anthem Blue Cross\",\"News\"],\"categories\":[\"Health Insurance\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2015\\/07\\/GettyImages-96525183-e1437746938599.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "Two class-action lawsuits charged Anthem with breach of contract after it raised deductibles and out-of-pocket limits mid-year in 2011.", "title": "Anthem Blue Cross Will Repay $8.3 Million to 50,000 California Customers", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2015/10/28/anthem-blue-cross-will-repay-8-3-million-to-50000-california-customers/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2015/07/GettyImages-96525183-1440x960.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "anthem blue cross,news", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Anthem agreed to no longer make mid-year alterations to individual customers\u2019 plans, unless a change in law or regulation supports such modifications.\nAnthem, California\u2019s second largest insurer, had raised annual deductibles, prescription drug deductibles and out-of-pocket limits for about 50,000 customers in mid-year in 2011, prompting two lawsuits alleging breach of contract.\nAnthem Blue Cross has settled a class action lawsuit to refund $8.3 million to tens of thousands of its members and has agreed to forgo mid-year changes to the deductible and out-of-pocket limits on its members\u2019 annual plans.\nWith the mid-year change, Taub and his wife saw their deductibles rise to $1,750.\nIn 2011, he and his wife were paying Anthem a combined premium of about $2,400 each month and had individual deductibles of $1,500."}
