Struggling energy companies may have some difficulty repaying their debt as low oil and commodity prices put pressure on their cash flows, according to a report by Moody’s Investors Service.

Moody’s downgraded the liquidity ratings of 23 companies in September. More than half of those were in the energy sector. The rating measures companies’ ability to repay their debt.

Moody’s cut ratings for Sheridan Production Company LLC, Harvest Operations Corp., and Paragon Offshore PLC, among others, in recent weeks.

“The scale of downgrades is another sign of the extent to which energy companies are being hit by low commodity prices, which are taking an increasingly heavy toll on earnings and cash flow,” said Moody’s in its report.

The ratings service added that investors are becoming more attuned to the risks from China’s economic slowdown and the possibility of higher interest rates in the U.S.

That said, a weak jobs report on Friday may have reduced the possibility of an interest rate hike in the U.S. this year.

The ratings service also warned that “companies are becoming dependent on increasingly fickle capital markets to alleviate liquidity pressures, and this is putting upward pressure on defaults.”
