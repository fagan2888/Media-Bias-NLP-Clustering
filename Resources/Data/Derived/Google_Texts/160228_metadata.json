Does that mean I can\u2019t contribute the max for the year to an HSA? What\u2019s the deadline for my 2015 contribution?\n\nSee Also: 50 Ways to Cut Your Health Care Costs\n\nYou have until April 18, 2016 (the tax-filing deadline) to make your 2015 contribution. But because you had the HSA only part of the year, you may not be able to contribute the maximum amount ($3,350 for individual coverage or $6,650 for family coverage, plus an extra $1,000 if you\u2019re 55 or older anytime in 2015).\n\nThe amount you can contribute depends on when you had the eligible coverage. For a policy to be eligible in 2015, it must have a deductible of at least $1,300 for single coverage or $2,600 for family coverage and meet a few other requirements (for example, the policy cannot have a separate deductible for prescription drugs). Your contributions will be pretax if they\u2019re made through your employer or tax-deductible if you make them on your own.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you had an HSA-eligible policy for only the first few months of the year, the size of your HSA contribution is based on the number of months you had the eligible coverage. If you had the policy from January through April, for example, you can contribute one-third of the full year\u2019s contribution.\n\nBut there is a special rule if you had an HSA-eligible policy on December 1. In that case, you can make the full year\u2019s contribution, even if you didn\u2019t have an HSA-eligible policy for the entire year. Note, however, that you must continue to have an eligible policy for all of 2016 or you will have to pay taxes and a 10% penalty on the money you contributed for the months that you didn\u2019t have the policy in 2015, says Stephen Neeleman, founder of HSA administrator HealthEquity. For more information about the last-month rule and the penalty calculation, see the Instructions for IRS Form 8889.\n\nFor more information about HSAs, see FAQs About Health Savings Accounts.\n\nSee Also: 5 Ways Your Health Insurance May Change in 2016\n\nGot a question?
