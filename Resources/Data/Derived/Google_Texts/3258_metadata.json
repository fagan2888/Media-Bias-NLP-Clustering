Accordingly, the Times reports, advocates expect that the fight for such legislation could take 10 or more years.\n\nWith gay people lacking even basic employment protections in 29 states \u2014 and no gender identity protections in 32 \u2014 discrimination against LGBT people remains stubbornly persistent, despite the dramatic shift in public opinion on issues like marriage equality.

While the sacred right to discriminate is the overarching concern that guides the anti-LGBT movement, the public accommodations issue particularly riles its ranks. The Times turned to the Family Research Council\u2019s Peter Sprigg to elaborate on social conservatives\u2019 concerns.\n\n\u201cThis is where the term \u2018bathroom bills\u2019 has been coined,\u201d Sprigg told the paper. \u201cApplying gender protections to public accommodations would mean that you have situations in which people who are biologically male could claim that they have a civil right to use a female designated facility \u2014 including restrooms, showers and locker rooms.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Gray Lady doesn't bother to fact-check a debunked -- and deeply bigoted -- claim", "author": "Luke Brinker", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The Gray Lady doesn't bother to fact-check a debunked -- and deeply bigoted -- claim", "title": "A vile myth reemerges: How the New York Times fumbled an important LGBT story", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/12/05/a_vile_myth_re_emerges_how_the_new_york_times_fumbled_an_important_lgbt_story/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/11/new_york_times_building.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Gray Lady doesn't bother to fact-check a debunked -- and deeply bigoted -- claim", "creator": "@LukeBrinker", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/11/new_york_times_building.jpg", "title": "A vile myth reemerges: How the New York Times fumbled an important LGBT story", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "A vile myth reemerges: How the New York Times fumbled an important LGBT story", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, employment discrimination, employment non-discrimination act, enda, Family research council, housing discrimination, John Boehner, LGBT, Media Criticism, Mike Huckabee, peter sprigg, R-Ohio, The New York Times, Transgender, transgender rights", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The civil rights bill envisioned by LGBT advocates would outlaw employment discrimination, as well as discrimination in housing, education, jury service, lending, and public accommodations.\nAccordingly, the Times reports, advocates expect that the fight for such legislation could take 10 or more years.\nThe Times turned to the Family Research Council\u2019s Peter Sprigg to elaborate on social conservatives\u2019 concerns.\nWhile the sacred right to discriminate is the overarching concern that guides the anti-LGBT movement, the public accommodations issue particularly riles its ranks.\nGiven that the political dynamics just got even worse \u2014 an anti-gay Republican majority takes control of the U.S. Senate next month, and the House is slated to move even further to the right \u2014 we likely won\u2019t see a sweeping LGBT civil rights bill anytime soon."}
