(His other big brag: His habit of telling people to shut up.) \u201cI just stand on my record,\u201d he told conservative radio host Laura Ingraham. \u201cI\u2019m pro-life. I ran on a pro-life platform in 2009. I vetoed Planned Parenthood funding five times out of the New Jersey budget.\u201d\n\nThis was a big applause line. Showing how badly you\u2019ve gutted, or how much you\u2019d like to gut, funding for family planning services has become something of a litmus test for Republican presidential hopefuls. Like Christie, Scott Walker eliminated funding for Planned Parenthood under the mantle of attacking abortion access. Rand Paul has previously voted to defund Planned Parenthood and said he would \u201cstop the flow of tax dollars to groups who perform or advocate for abortion.\u201d Marco Rubio joined Paul in the vote to defund the health provider, and has made no secret of his plans to further restrict access.\n\nBut because state and federal laws already prohibit public dollars from funding abortion, it\u2019s not abortion access that\u2019s on the chopping block. Instead, going after family planning services eliminates funding for essential preventative care. That means access to cancer screenings, family planning services and STI tests.\n\nWhat that amounts to is a 2016 GOP platform of Let them have herpes and breast cancer.\n\nTake Christie\u2019s and Walker\u2019s records as a case study in what happens when you grandstand about abortion at the expense of thousands of low-income people who need basic healthcare. (And \u201cbasic healthcare\u201d means the ability to avoid pregnancy, safely carry pregnancies to term, check out a lump in your breast and treat syphilis before it makes you lose your vision/go insane. These are not luxury services.)\n\nChristie eliminated all funding for family planning in his 2010 budget. And as Tara Culp-Ressler noted in a report at ThinkProgress, the consequences were drastic. The National Family Planning & Reproductive Health Association found a 25 percent drop in the state\u2019s ability to provide care for New Jersey\u2019s poorest residents. According to data from Planned Parenthood, the cuts meant that providers performed \u201cfar fewer\u201d STI tests than in previous years: \u201cFrom 2009-2012, the number of gonorrhea tests declined by 24 percent, chlamydia by 28 percent, syphilis by 29 percent, and HIV by 18 percent.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Christie and Walker talk tough about their \"pro-life\" cuts to family planning.
