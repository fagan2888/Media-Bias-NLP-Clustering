I have a lot of prescriptions that\u2019ll just make a hardship for me,\u201d said patient Keith Clark.\n\nClark and thousands of Medicaid patients across Ohio will have to go to a new pharmacy to get their prescriptions filled.\n\n\u201cMy pharmacy is one mile away, they want me to go eight miles away,\u201d said Clark.\n\nThe changes are for patients who go through the United Healthcare Managed Medicaid Organizations program, the changes only impact United Healthcare patients.\n\nBeginning March 1, at least 800 pharmacies across Ohio will not be able to fill prescriptions under the new network plan.\n\nAccording to the Ohio Pharmacists Association, the Department of Medicaid doesn\u2019t have any plans to stop the changes United Healthcare is making.\n\nPatients said the move is restrictive, and will make it difficult for those who don\u2019t have access to transportation.\n\n\u201cThey sent me a letter indicating from UHC. They are forcing me to choose a different pharmacy and I don\u2019t want to go elsewhere,\u201d said patient Karen Hoover.\n\nIn response, United Healthcare sent a statement saying:\n\n\u201cAs part of our ongoing efforts to ensure Medicaid beneficiaries have access to quality pharmacies that offer affordable medications, we are making changes to the network. We are working with those individuals who are affected by the change to ensure they receive the medications they need\u2026\u201d\n\nSenior Vice President of Pharmacy Operations for Hometown Pharmacy, Ron McDermott, said UHC\u2019s claim the changes will help with affordable prescriptions doesn\u2019t add up.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t make any sense. Why would a Medicaid system shove them to a pharmacy that\u2019s going to charge them more or the Medicaid more than what we\u2019d charge them?\u201d said McDermott.\n\nThere is a silver lining for patients, though. If they wish to change to another Managed Medicaid Provider, they can do so through the end of April.\n\nState Senator Joe Schiavoni said his office has been working to find a solution to help patients however, he\u2019s not sure if a solution will come soon enough.\n\n\u201cThere has to be some way that everybody can get together on this and I\u2019m not sure if there is,\u201d said Schiavoni.\n\nFor now, patients across the state are working to find new pharmacies, or make changes with their insurance company.\n\n\u201cWe want to get our voice heard,\u201d said Hoover.\n\nPetitions across the state are being signed to show patient support behind the 800-plus pharmacies across Ohio.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Local lawmakers and frustrated patients alike weighed in on the grief these recent changes are expected to cause.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.linmedia.newstouch.wkbn", "og": {"site_name": "WKBN.com", "description": "Local lawmakers and frustrated patients alike weighed in on the grief these recent changes are expected to cause.", "title": "Recent changes to Ohio Medicaid cause grief", "url": "http://wkbn.com/2015/02/15/recent-changes-to-ohio-medicaid-cause-grief/", "image": {"width": 200, "identifier": "http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/6b669850d8c37f8641ad8027e102d151?s=200&ts=1464255050", "height": 200}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "WKBN.com", "description": "Youngstown, OH, Warren, OH and Sharon, PA local news, investigative news, weather and sports.", "title": "WKBN Youngstown news, weather, sports", "url": "http://wkbn.com/", "image": "https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/530521166868267008/--gcwa1L_400x400.png", "creator": "@WKBN", "site": "wkbn", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"iphone": "WKBN 27 FIrst News - Youngstown", "googleplay": "WKBN 27 First News"}, "id": {"iphone": 412441075}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "changes, grief, medicaid, ohio, Patients, pharmacies,27 Investigates, home, Local News, News,WKBN Staff", "msapplication-tooltip": "Youngstown, OH, Warren, OH and Sharon, PA local news, investigative news, weather and sports.", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://wkbn.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/6b669850d8c37f8641ad8027e102d151?s=16", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=412441075", "fb": {"app_id": 121775821624, "pages": 101928538694}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "application-name": "WKBN.com", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WKBN27", "published_time": "2015-02-16T02:29:30+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-16T18:19:41+00:00"}, "msvalidate.01": "482CE246B7060643327A0CDA3172B0E6", "google-site-verification": "LIwiJCyVg438RCDLx8Ytjk46NiwGsiadcaYSFBt4m3k", "yandex-verification": "49a086961d263e91"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce6a3\"", "article_summary": "The changes are for patients who go through the United Healthcare Managed Medicaid Organizations program, the changes only impact United Healthcare patients.\nAccording to the Ohio Pharmacists Association, the Department of Medicaid doesn\u2019t have any plans to stop the changes United Healthcare is making.\nLocal lawmakers and frustrated patients alike weighed in on the grief these recent changes are expected to cause.\nClark and thousands of Medicaid patients across Ohio will have to go to a new pharmacy to get their prescriptions filled.\nYOUNGSTOWN, Ohio (WKBN) \u2014 Hundreds of pharmacies across Ohio will start turning people away in less than two weeks because of major changes to the state Medicaid system."}
