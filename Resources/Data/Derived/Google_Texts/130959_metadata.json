Bill Walker in an effort to prevent him from unilaterally expanding Medicaid in the state.\n\nChristie Herrera, a senior fellow at The Foundation for Government Accountability, told The Daily Signal in an interview that the lawsuit is about \u201cseparation of powers.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho holds the power of the purse?\u201d Herrera asked. \u201cThis is a case about good government, not Medicaid.\u201d\n\nUnder Alaska law, the governor has the authority to introduce bills in the legislature. Walker introduced a Medicaid expansion bill in March, but the legislature did not pass it. In July, Walker announced he would act unilaterally to expand Medicaid in Alaska.\n\nWalker has argued that accepting federal funds to expand Medicaid is within his purview as governor because he is permitted to distribute these funds to existing state programs without the legislature\u2019s approval.\n\nCritics of Walker\u2019s decision argue that a Medicaid expansion is a new program and thus requires the approval of the legislature because it introduces individuals into the system who were not previously eligible.\n\nHerrera said the state legislature\u2019s rejection of an expansion \u201cis a lynch pin for other governors to follow.\u201d\n\nShe noted that 21 states\u2014including Alaska\u2014have rejected Medicaid expansion.\n\nAlaska\u2019s KTUU reports that the legislature has approved $450,000 for legal counsel from two law firms for their lawsuit against Walker.\n\nWalker, an independent, has long advocated expanding Medicaid in the state under Obamacare.\n\nIn a statement provided to The Daily Signal, Walker said the expansion would save taxpayer money.\n\n\u201cMedicaid expansion will save the state over $100 million in its first six years and provide more than 20,000 working Alaskans with access to health care,\u201d Walker said.\n\nAccording to a July press release from Walker\u2019s office, 29 states and the District of Columbia have expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Alaska Legislature approved funds on Tuesday to sue Gov.
