Centene Corp., a Medicaid insurer, is buying Woodland Hills-based insurer Health Net for $6.8 billion. Aetna is buying Humana for $35 billion in cash and stock, and Anthem is trying to buy Cigna.\n\nThe cash is flowing thanks to the Affordable Care Act, which requires every American to have a health insurance policy and provides taxpayer funds to insurance companies to help pay for it. The U.S. government is on track to spend $1.2 trillion over the next decade on these subsidies and related costs.\n\nYee-haw.\n\nOn June 30, the U.S. government\u2019s Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services released an interesting report about a temporary program that reimburses insurers for claims over $45,000 and up to $250,000. For 2014, the U.S. will pay about $7.9 billion to insurance companies, which pay a fee of $63 per customer to fund this reinsurance program.\n\nA second program for \u201crisk adjustment\u201d transfers money from insurance companies with a greater proportion of healthy customers to insurers with a greater proportion of sick customers.\n\nThe programs are intended to protect insurance companies from the full risks of covering people with expensive health problems.\n\nYou know, that\u2019s all we really needed in the first place.\n\nIf there was one thing everybody could agree on during the debate over health care reform, it was that people with pre-existing conditions needed help getting health insurance.\n\nAll the rest of the Affordable Care Act \u2014 the \u201cessential\u201d benefits required in every policy, the exchanges, the subsidies, the individual mandate, employer mandate, data collection, \u201cCadillac\u201d tax, medical device tax, Medicare tax on investment income, costly compliance requirements \u2014 was pushed through Congress on the coattails of guaranteeing coverage for pre-existing conditions.\n\nWe could have had a risk-sharing program for insurance companies, a subsidy for high-cost claims, and a guarantee that people who were willing to stay continuously insured could never be turned away for a pre-existing condition.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInstead we have a trillion dollars of taxpayer-funded subsidies pouring into insurance companies, which are gleefully merging away their competition and already raising rates for 2016.\n\nMeanwhile, employees are paying a greater share of their health premiums \u2014 an increase of 93 percent in 10 years \u2014 while wage growth has stagnated. And 37 million Americans now have high-deductible policies that require them to pay as much as $6,000 for medical care, sometimes even more, before the insurance company pays anything.\n\nThe ACA is giving us giant insurance companies, too big to fail, supported by government force against customers who have fewer and fewer choices.\n\nPerhaps an onslaught of angry voters, or math, will deliver the ACA to the fate of Penn Square Bank. Then what? Maybe this:\n\n\u2022 Preserve the risk-adjustment and reinsurance programs in a way that allows guarantees access to health insurance for people with pre-existing conditions.\n\n\u2022 Allow medical providers and insurance companies to decide for themselves what services and products to sell, and at what price.\n\n\u2022 Lift the mandates on individuals and employers.\n\n\u2022 Maintain Medicare and Medicaid/Medi-Cal with adequate funding.\n\n\u2022 Get the government out of the business of collecting personal health data and evaluating treatments.\n\nFor once, champagne all around.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Not long before the collapse of Oklahoma City\u2019s Penn Square Bank in 1982, the bank\u2019s high-flying executives were raucously handing out $2 billion in loans and drinking champagne out of cowboy boots.Today, executives in the health", "title": "Affordable Care Act\u2019s extra weight is unhealthy for taxpayers: Susan Shelley", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailynews.com/opinion/20150724/affordable-care-acts-extra-weight-is-unhealthy-for-taxpayers-susan-shelley", "image": {"width": "1500px", "identifier": "http://www.dailynews.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/LA/20150724/LOCAL1/150729725/AR/0/AR-150729725.jpg?Maxh=1500&Maxw=1500", "height": "1000px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Affordable Care Act\u2019s extra weight is unhealthy for taxpayers: Susan Shelley"}, "twitter": {"domain": "dailynews.com", "description": "Not long before the collapse of Oklahoma City\u2019s Penn Square Bank in 1982, the bank\u2019s high-flying executives were raucously handing out $2 billion in loans and drinking champagne out of cowboy boots.Today, executives in the health", "title": "Affordable Care Act\u2019s extra weight is unhealthy for taxpayers: Susan Shelley", "url": "http://www.dailynews.com/opinion/20150724/affordable-care-acts-extra-weight-is-unhealthy-for-taxpayers-susan-shelley", "image": {"src": "http://www.dailynews.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/LA/20150724/LOCAL1/150729725/AR/0/AR-150729725.jpg?Maxh=900&Maxw=900"}, "site": "@ladailynews", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id551745144", "iphone": "id502957174", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.ladailynews"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "keywords": "Columns, Columns news, Los Angeles Columns news, CA Columns news, US Columns news, world Columns news.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Columns, Columns news, Los Angeles Columns news, CA Columns news, US Columns news, world Columns news."}, "article_summary": "\u2022 Allow medical providers and insurance companies to decide for themselves what services and products to sell, and at what price.\nToday, executives in the health insurance industry may be drinking champagne out of specimen cups.\nThe ACA is giving us giant insurance companies, too big to fail, supported by government force against customers who have fewer and fewer choices.\nIf there was one thing everybody could agree on during the debate over health care reform, it was that people with pre-existing conditions needed help getting health insurance.\nThe cash is flowing thanks to the Affordable Care Act, which requires every American to have a health insurance policy and provides taxpayer funds to insurance companies to help pay for it."}
