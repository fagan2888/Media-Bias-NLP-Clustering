None. Zilch.\n\nSanders has persuaded not one of his fellow liberal Democrats to sign on.\n\nNot Elizabeth Warren (D-Massachusetts).\n\nNot Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio).\n\nNot Tammy Baldwin (D-Wisconsin).\n\nNot Ed Markey (D-Massachusetts).\n\nAnd no explanation as to why not.\n\nFacing no support in the Senate, Senator Sanders barged ahead yesterday and held a hearing on the benefits single payer would bring to the United States.\n\n\u201cWhat this hearing is really about is two fundamental issues,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cFirst, the U.S., the wealthiest country on the planet, is the only major industrialized country in the world that does not guarantee health care as a right to its citizens. Should we consider joining the rest of the world? I\u2019d argue we should.\u201d\n\n\u201cSecond, the U.S. spends twice as much as other countries that have much better health outcomes. What can we learn from these countries?\u201d asked Sanders, chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Primary Health and Aging.\n\nCiting World Health Organization data, Sanders said the U.S. spends as much as three times more on healthcare than other industrialized countries.\n\nHealth care outlays in the U.S. account for about 18 percent of our Gross Domestic Product, significantly more than in France, Germany, Denmark, Canada, Great Britain, Australia, Norway, Taiwan and Israel, Sanders said.\n\nIn Denmark, \u201call citizens have access to care; no one may be denied services on the basis of income, age, health or employment status,\u201d according to Jakob Kjellberg, an economist from Copenhagen.\n\nVictor Rodwin, an expert on the French health care system, said \u201cthe French have easy access to primary health care, as well as specialty services, at half the per capita costs of what we spend in the U.S.\u201d\n\nOther witnesses said the money Americans sink into their expensive health care system does not buy better care.\n\n\u201cCanada achieved health outcomes that are at least equal to those in the U.S. at two-thirds the cost,\u201d according to one witness at the hearing, Dr. Danielle Martin of Women\u2019s College Hospital in Toronto.\n\nThe United States ranks 26th in life expectancy compared to other countries ranked by the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.\n\nPeople who live in Italy, Spain, France, Australia, Israel, Norway and other countries live two to three years longer than Americans.\n\nSanders said that while the Affordable Care Act has improved access to insurance, \u201cmillions of Americans still lack insurance or have plans with such high deductibles and copayments that they cannot afford the care they need.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs a result, some 45,000 uninsured Americans die each year because they didn\u2019t go to a doctor in time,\u201d Sanders said.\n\nA major factor driving up health care costs in the U.S. is the high cost of prescription drugs, Sanders said.\n\nHospital stays also cost more. While hospitals in Germany and France charge $3,000 for an appendectomy, for example, the average price for the same procedure in American hospitals is $13,000. Some U.S. hospitals charge $28,000.\n\n\u201cIt is time for the U.S. to join the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee access to health care as a right of all people, not just a privilege for those who can afford it,\u201d Sanders said.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 3.8.14", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd293c\"", "article_summary": "Last December, Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont) introduced a single payer bill (S. 1782).\nA major factor driving up health care costs in the U.S. is the high cost of prescription drugs, Sanders said.\nCiting World Health Organization data, Sanders said the U.S. spends as much as three times more on healthcare than other industrialized countries.\nFacing no support in the Senate, Senator Sanders barged ahead yesterday and held a hearing on the benefits single payer would bring to the United States.\nWhat can we learn from these countries?\u201d asked Sanders, chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Primary Health and Aging."}
