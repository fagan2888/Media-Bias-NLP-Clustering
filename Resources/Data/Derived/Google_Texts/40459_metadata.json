This week\u2019s hearings give community members and commuters a chance to comment on the plan in person or in writing, said Amy Ford, spokeswoman for the Colorado Department of Transportation.\n\n\u201cFor the most part, we are looking for people to speak out and comment on the plan,\u201d she said.\n\nThe hearings will be from 5-8 p.m. Tuesday in Aurora at Sable Elementary School (2601 Sable Blvd.); Wednesday in Commerce City at Kearney Middle School (6160 Kearney St.); and Thursday in Denver at Bruce Randolph Middle School ( 3955 Steele St.).\n\nThe comment period has been extended to Oct. 31, Ford said.\n\nCDOT planners are advocating removing the deteriorating, 50-year-old viaduct on I-70 between Brighton Boulevard and Colorado Boulevard, lowering the highway below grade and adding two tolled express lanes in each direction.\n\nCrews also would build an almost four-acre landscaped cover over the interstate by Swansea Elementary School.\n\nCDOT says this alternative will reunite the Swansea and Elyria neighborhoods. The idea has also gathered support from various groups including the Denver Chamber of Commerce, National Western Stock Show, Union Pacific Railroad and the Elyria-Swansea Business Association, said CDOT executive director Don Hunt.\n\n\u201cWe have spent a decade working with area residents, the business community and regional civic and economic development leaders\u201d to produce this plan, Hunt said.\n\nCritics, however, say sending the highway below grade will be an environmental disaster. Many of them want to move I-70 completely out of the northeast Denver area, saying that will spark economic development in the area.\n\nThad Tecza, a CDOT opponent, says this week\u2019s hearings won\u2019t truly offer alternatives to CDOT\u2019s plan. \u201cThese hearings are a sham,\u201d Tecza said.\n\nThe draft report lays the groundwork for the final environmental impact statement, which will be produced in 2015 and forwarded to federal highway officials.\n\nThey will review the document and, if approved, likely will give the go-ahead for the project by 2016, with construction starting then or in early 2017, Ford said.\n\nMonte Whaley: 720-929-0907, mwhaley@denverpost.com or twitter.com/montewhaley", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "I-70 tunnel plan in Denver open for public review this week", "title": "I-70 tunnel plan in Denver open for public review this week", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/09/22/i-70-tunnel-plan-in-denver-open-for-public-review-this-week/", "image": {"width": 495, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140922__SIM_I-70EastEIS_Aerial_PartialCoveredLoweredAlt1p1.jpg", "height": 387}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140922__SIM_I-70EastEIS_Aerial_PartialCoveredLoweredAlt1p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-22T17:23:54+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T10:22:10+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb044\"", "article_summary": "Thad Tecza, a CDOT opponent, says this week\u2019s hearings won\u2019t truly offer alternatives to CDOT\u2019s plan.\nThe entire I-70 remake is laid out in a four-volume report, officially called the I-70 East Supplemental Draft Environmental Impact Statement.\n\u201cFor the most part, we are looking for people to speak out and comment on the plan,\u201d she said.\nThis week\u2019s hearings give community members and commuters a chance to comment on the plan in person or in writing, said Amy Ford, spokeswoman for the Colorado Department of Transportation.\nMany of them want to move I-70 completely out of the northeast Denver area, saying that will spark economic development in the area."}
