He favors reducing taxes and regulations, repealing ObamaCare and increasing domestic energy production. Challenger Erin McClelland, a Harrison Democrat, supports dubious \u201cpay equity\u201d legislation (there are ample laws already on the books), parrots other liberal talking points and brags of her union endorsements.\n\nMr. Shuster, of Hollidaysburg, chairs the powerful House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. Against ObamaCare, \u201cstimulus\u201d and EPA overreach, he's for tax and regulatory reform, strong defense and gun rights. Democrat opponent Alanna Hartzok, of Fayetteville, also favors gun rights but supports a job-killing hike in the minimum wage, extreme environmental policies, following the United Nations' lead internationally and \u201ccampaign finance reform\u201d that mocks free speech.\n\nMr. Kelly, a business-friendly Butler car dealer, advocates forcing government to live within its means and curbing its growth. How refreshing it is to hear his straight talk from the floor or during committee hearings. Political-novice Democrat challenger Dan LaVallee, of Cranberry, offers few details in urging \u201cnew leadership to get our economy moving\u201d but supports a higher minimum wage and spending more on ineffective Head Start.\n\nMr. Barletta, co-founder of a small business who's outspoken about federal debt, jobs and domestic energy, maintains the anti-amnesty immigration stance he took as Hazleton's mayor. His opponent, Susquehanna Township civil rights lawyer Andy Ostrowski, supports gun rights and is moderate \u2014 for a Democrat \u2014 on some other issues. But he lacks Barletta's experience and record of constituent service.\n\nRe-elect Keith Rothfus, Bill Shuster, Mike Kelly and Lou Barletta.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Tribune-Review", "description": "On Nov. 4, vote to keep Pennsylvania Republicans Keith Rothfus (12th District), Bill Shuster (9th), Mike Kelly (3rd) and Lou Barletta (11th) in the U.S. ...", "pubdate": "2014-10-23 20:55:11", "author": "Tribune-Review", "og": {"site_name": "TribLIVE.com", "description": "On Nov. 4, vote to keep Pennsylvania Republicans Keith Rothfus (12th District), Bill Shuster (9th), Mike Kelly (3rd) and Lou Barletta (11th) in the U.S. ...", "title": "For U.S. House, Pa.: Re-elect Rothfus, Shuster, Kelly and Barletta", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://triblive.com/csp/mediapool/sites/TribLIVE/assets2/img/logos/triblive/TribLIVELogo.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-10-23 21:07:45.23", "url": "http://triblive.com/opinion/editorials/6970777-74/barletta-kelly-rothfus", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"description": "On Nov. 4, vote to keep Pennsylvania Republicans Keith Rothfus (12th District), Bill Shuster (9th), Mike Kelly (3rd) and Lou Barletta (11th) in the U.S. ...", "creator": "@triblive", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "tribbird://", "iphone": "tribbird://"}, "name": {"ipad": "TribLIVE News and Sports", "iphone": "TribLIVE News and Sports"}, "id": {"ipad": 328217517, "iphone": 328217517}}, "title": "For U.S. House, Pa.: Re-elect Rothfus, Shuster, Kelly and Barletta", "site": {"identifier": "@triblive", "id": 20269833}, "image": "http://triblive.com/csp/mediapool/sites/TribLIVE/assets2/img/logos/triblive/TribLIVETwitter.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-10-23 20:55:11", "fb": {"app_id": 144410955752326}, "sailthru.title": "For U.S. House, Pa.: Re-elect Rothfus, Shuster, Kelly and Barletta", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=328217517", "sailthru.canonical": "http://triblive.com/opinion/editorials/6970777-74/barletta-kelly-rothfus", "keywords": "barletta, kelly, rothfus, shuster, democrat", "headline": "For U.S. House, Pa.: Re-elect Rothfus, Shuster, Kelly and Barletta", "sailthru.tags": "Newsletter, Opinion, Editorials", "article": {"category": "Opinion", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/triblive", "published_time": "2014-10-23 20:55:11", "subcategory": "Editorials", "mainsection": "Opinion", "section": "Opinion", "publishedtoweb": "2014-10-23 20:55:11", "modified_time": "2014-10-23 21:07:45.23", "tag": "barletta, kelly, rothfus, shuster, democrat", "subsection": "Editorials", "title": "For U.S. House, Pa.: Re-elect Rothfus, Shuster, Kelly and Barletta", "author": "Tribune-Review"}, "docauthor": "Tribune-Review", "sailthru.description": "On Nov. 4, vote to keep Pennsylvania Republicans Keith Rothfus (12th District), Bill Shuster (9th), Mike Kelly (3rd) and Lou Barletta (11th) in the U.S. ..."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf4cc\"", "article_summary": "For U.S. House, Pa.: Re-elect Rothfus, Shuster, Kelly & BarlettaEmail Newsletters Sign up for one of our email newsletters.\nRe-elect Keith Rothfus, Bill Shuster, Mike Kelly and Lou Barletta.\nOn Nov. 4, vote to keep Pennsylvania Republicans Keith Rothfus (12th District), Bill Shuster (9th), Mike Kelly (3rd) and Lou Barletta (11th) in the U.S. House.\nHis opponent, Susquehanna Township civil rights lawyer Andy Ostrowski, supports gun rights and is moderate \u2014 for a Democrat \u2014 on some other issues.\nAgainst ObamaCare, \u201cstimulus\u201d and EPA overreach, he's for tax and regulatory reform, strong defense and gun rights."}
