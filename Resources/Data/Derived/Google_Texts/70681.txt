Housing First is another cost-effective strategy that has been used by Utah and many other communities to provide ongoing housing and assistance to people as they transition out of homelessness and back into community lives. Substance treatment, mental health care and medical referral/attention are the focus of Housing First on-site programs and all of the tenants pay rent according to their income or ability to pay. Nationally, these programs have demonstrated a reduction in drinking among participants, dramatic reductions in costly community services and stability, often for the first time in many years for the tenants of these programs. Some studies suggest the magnitude of savings are profound -- each individual living on the street receiving emergency services generates social costs of approximately $50,000 to $60,000 per year; in contrast, the Housing First option is approximately $15,000 to $20,000. Here in Alaska, our Housing First programs have demonstrated similar results, and we will be promoting this housing approach for the homeless in Anchorage. Our goal is to generate 300 units in this niche.
