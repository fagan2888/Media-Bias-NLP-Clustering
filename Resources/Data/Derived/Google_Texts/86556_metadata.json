REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst (UNITED STATES - Tags: POLITICS) - RTX187YI\n\n4084143\n\nAmericans for Prosperity, a well-funded conservative group, is putting more than half a million dollars behind an attacking Arkansas Democratic Sen. Mark Pryor, considered one of the most vulnerable incumbents in the upcoming midterm elections.\n\nThe ad targets Pryor, who faces a tough re-election in a decidedly red state, on his support for Obamacare. It will begin running on television statewide on Thursday, and AFP has put $606,000 behind it.\n\n\u201cThis is I think the first of many fronts that we\u2019re going to approach Sen. Pryor on,\u201d AFP\u2019s Arkansas State Director Jason Cline told The Daily Caller. He says that the group will also have a \u201cvery aggressive\u201d ground game \u2014 knocking on doors and running phone banks \u2014 to tell voters \u201chow bad it\u2019s going to be for families and businesses\u201d under Obamacare, and that Pryor was one of the people who voted to enact the law.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a full assault,\u201d Cline said.\n\nThe ad features a woman speaking to straight to the camera speaking about why \u201cObamacare doesn\u2019t work. It just doesn\u2019t work.\u201d She is standing against a white background and there is no music.\n\n\u201cHealth care isn\u2019t about politics, it\u2019s about people \u2026 Tell Sen. Pryor to stop thinking about politics and start thinking about people,\u201d she says.\n\nThe ad does not mention Pryor\u2019s Republican opponent, U.S. Rep. Tom Cotton.\n\nAmericans for Prosperity, which is funded by the billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch, is spending big against vulnerable Democrats this cycle. They recently put $1.4 million behind ads attacking Democratic Sen. Kay Hagan in North Carolina, Politico reported, and they have also run ads attacking Democratic Senate candidates in Iowa and Michigan, and Democratic Rep. Nick Rahall in West Virginia.\n\nThe Pryor campaign dismissed the ad as \u201cmisleading.\u201d\n\n\u201cFolks here are sick of these misleading attacks from Congressman Cotton\u2019s special interest backers, groups that care nothing about Arkansas but know that Cotton will be a vote to privatize Medicare and add to Washington\u2019s partisan gridlock,\u201d said Erik Dorey, Pryor\u2019s deputy campaign manager, in a statement to TheDC. Pryor went up with a microsite Wednesday accusing Cotton of catering to special interest groups, like the Club for Growth and AFP, rather than Arkansans.\n\nFollow Alexis on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Alexis Levinson", "description": "Americans for Prosperity is putting more than half a million dollars behind an attacking Arkansas Democratic Sen.
