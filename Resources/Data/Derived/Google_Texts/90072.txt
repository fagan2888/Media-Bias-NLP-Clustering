Curtis Leskanic shaved his arms. It helped him pitch faster, he thought, with less wind resistance. That quirk of his personality is by far more memorable than when he walked out of the bullpen with a four-game, season-opening winning streak on the line.

Who can remember Leskanic’s blown save at Houston on April 30, 1995? Who can remember the last time the Rockies had won four games to open a season before this year?

“I don’t remember. I really don’t,” said Rockies manager Walt Weiss, the starting shortstop on that 1995 team. “I vaguely remember getting off to a good start.”

The Rockies were 4-0 again entering Saturday night’s game against the Chicago Cubs. After a series sweep at Milwaukee and a home-opening win Friday, the Rockies were undefeated and had veteran right-hander Kyle Kendrick on the mound. He wasn’t even in high school 20 years ago.

But like the 1995 Rockies, the streak stopped at 4-0. Two former Rockies — outfielder Dexter Fowler and pitcher Jason Hammel — helped cool Colorado’s sizzling start, and Kendrick allowed a career-high eight earned runs in the Cubs’ 9-5 victory.

This is the Rockies’ 23rd season, and they never have started a season 5-0. But they won seven of their first eight games in 1995 on their way to a 77-67 record. That team earned the Rockies’ first postseason berth.

“I’m sure people weren’t picking us to win the World Series that year,” Weiss said. “But I remember we had a pretty good feeling about the club.”

The same applies to the 2015 Rockies. Their 21 extra-base hits in the first three games were the second-most by a major-league team since 1900. They had three more Friday. That left the Rockies and their fans feeling fine.

But Fowler, who went 0-for-5 during his return to Coors Field on Friday, busted out Saturday. He tripled in the first and second innings, scoring twice and knocking in two runs.

“Dexter hits a lot of triples,” Weiss said. “We’ve seen him do it here.”

In 32 career at-bats against Kendrick, Fowler has four triples.

The Rockies, though, were hanging tough behind their new starter. After Fowler’s two-run triple in the second inning, the Rockies’ Nolan Arenado launched a 432-foot, two-run homer to left-center field, two-thirds of the way up the bleachers. That trimmed Chicago’s lead to 3-2.

But Kendrick served up back-to-back solo home runs in the third, to Chris Coghlan and Mike Olt. Starlin Castro hit another on the first pitch of the fifth inning.

Kendrick, pitching at Coors Field for the first time since signing with the Rockies during the offseason, allowed three homers and five walks in five innings. His ERA rose to 6.00.

“My command obviously wasn’t there,” Kendrick said. “Walking five guys, that wasn’t me.”

Hammel gave up eight hits, but he struck out six and walked none. He helped silence the top of the Rockies’ lineup — Charlie Blackmon and Carlos Gonzalez combined to go 1-for-9. But DJ LeMahieu’s 3-for-4 game lifted his average to .524.

Cubs’ Kyle Hendricks (7-2, 2.46 ERA in 2014) vs. Rockies’ Jordan Lyles (1-0, 3.00 in 2015), 2:10 p.m. Sunday, ROOT; 850 AM

Lyles skidded into the end of last season, as the Rockies lost in five of his final six starts. But he’s 5-1 with a 5.00 ERA in 11 career starts at Colorado. And he allowed just two runs on five hits in a 5-2 win at Milwaukee on Tuesday. When asked about Hendricks watching scouting video on a laptop, Cubs manager Joe Maddon said, jokingly: “He was checking out Wikipedia. … He’s researching something to do with the Flatirons and Chinook winds. I think they were the two big topics today.”
