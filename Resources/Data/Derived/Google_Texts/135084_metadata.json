The department itself would eventually become a Medicare-like payer entity.\n\nNumerous veterans' groups, however, have denounced the proposal, according to the article, writing in a letter to Commission Chairwoman Nancy Schlichting that not only did the drafting process lack transparency, the proposal demonstrated an \"utter lack of consideration that veterans would want to improve and expand the VA healthcare system.\"\n\nOfficials with the American Legion, of the letters' signatories, also suggested there was a conflict of interest among the seven members who issued the proposal, noting that three are from the private sector while a fourth sits on the board of a group that has proposed its own privatization plan for veterans' healthcare.\n\nMeanwhile, the embattled department continues to struggle to effectively discipline its employees and continues to employ people accused of serious misconduct and even crimes.\n\nFierceHealthcarae previously reported that it could take up to a year to fire three executives at the center of the original scandal. Now the Washington Times reports a VA nursing assistant in Alexandria, Louisiana, continues to draw a paycheck while awaiting manslaughter charges.\n\nMeanwhile, an employee in Puerto Rico was fired over armed robbery charges, but was reinstated with back pay after pointing to coworkers who kept their jobs despite being registered sex offenders and being arrested for driving intoxicated.\n\nThese reports come in the wake of allegations within the Texas VA system of falsified wait times akin to those that sparked the initial scandal.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read the Military Times article\n\n- here's the Washington Times article\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nVA scandal: Department may take more than a year to fire embattled execs\n\nScandal pushes officials to redesign the VA healthcare delivery system\n\nVA scandal: Heads finally roll as agency proposes removal of three execs at Phoenix VA Health System\n\nVA OIG still hasn't released months-old reports into wait-time scandal\n\nVA scandal: Internal investigations neglected whistleblower concerns\n\nVA troubles mount: Audit reveals department failed to spend $1.9B on healthcare\n\nVA scandal: Continued care access problems at Oklahoma facility reflect national concerns\n\nVA scandal: Department unveils plan to consolidate private doc networks\n\nVA paid $142M in bonuses during the year of scandal\n\nVA scandal: Claims that higher pay would improve care may not hold water", "article_metadata": {"description": "Nearly two years after the beginning of a scandal that rocked the Department of Veterans Affairs, a panel is considering a proposal that would turn veterans' care over to the private sector.
