(REUTERS/Larry Downing)\n\n4234434\n\nOne of Obamacare\u2019s ongoing structural problems is preventing close to 2 million low-income children from getting affordable health coverage, according to a report from the American Action Forum, a free market think tank.\n\nThe so-called \u201cfamily glitch\u201d is a well-known problem with Obamacare\u2019s treatment of what it means for an employer to offer affordable health coverage. The health-care law doesn\u2019t offer subsidies to workers whose employer offers what the federal government deems affordable coverage \u2014 but doesn\u2019t consider whether employer coverage for workers\u2019 families is affordable as well. The structure potentially bans spouses and children from receiving Obamacare\u2019s much-touted help with premium payments while their available insurance is extremely costly.\n\nBut the glitch also prevents children who would be eligible to participate in the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Plan, a program to insure low-income children, from getting access to their own subsidized coverage if the program is to end when it\u2019s up for reauthorization this year.\n\nWhile CHIP is supposed to help those who don\u2019t earn enough to purchase their own children health insurance but earn too much for Medicaid coverage, Obamacare doesn\u2019t have its own solution for children\u2019s coverage. When the program is up for its review this year, AAF warns that ending it and assuming Obamacare will take care of the rest could leave many children without access to coverage.\n\n\u201cThis flaw in the ACA\u2019s design prevents an estimated 1.9 million children from having access to subsidized health insurance through the Exchange,\u201d American Action Forum health care analysts Angela Boothe and Christopher Holt wrote Tuesday.\n\nObamacare\u2019s weaknesses means Congress should keep CHIP around past this year, AAF argues, but with some changes.\n\n\u201cBecause of the loopholes in the ACA, some children will still need CHIP, but any reauthorization of the program should be designed and funded in a way that allows states to meet the needs of their changing CHIP populations, streamlines program operations and maintains beneficiary responsibility,\u201d Boothe and Holt wrote.\n\nWhile it\u2019s unlikely that the program would be entirely discontinued, some states may make changes that could disadvantage children that fall int0 the glitch gap. Georgetown University health reform analysts warned in September that several states had already discontinued their CHIP programs in light of Obamacare, and more may follow suit.\n\nWhile children\u2019s coverage until CHIP will only be endangered if Congress fails to reauthorize the program, many families not eligible for CHIP are still currently banned from some of Obamacare\u2019s cushier benefits. Kaiser Family Foundation has estimated that the average cost of health coverage for families is as high as $15,700 per year.\n\nFollow Sarah on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Sarah Hurtubise", "description": "One of Obamacare's ongoing structural problems is preventing close to 2 million low-income children from getting affordable health coverage.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "One of Obamacare's ongoing structural problems is preventing close to 2 million low-income children from getting affordable health coverage, according to a report from the\u00a0American Action Forum,\u00a0a f", "title": "Report: Obamacare Glitch Could Endanger Coverage For Millions Of Kids", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2014/06/24/report-obamacare-glitch-could-endanger-coverage-for-millions-of-kids/", "image": {"width": 630, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/obama1.jpg", "height": 270}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "CHIP program's almost over", "creator": "@@SarahMHurtubise", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2014/06/24/report-obamacare-glitch-could-endanger-coverage-for-millions-of-kids/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/obama1.jpg"}, "title": "Report: Obamacare Glitch Could Endanger Coverage For Millions Of Kids Via @dailycaller", "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-06-24 21:52:09", "sailthru.title": "Report: Obamacare Glitch Could Endanger Coverage For Millions Of Kids", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "keywords": "obamacare", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "sailthru.tags": "obamacare,sarah-hurtubise", "sailthru.description": "One of Obamacare's ongoing structural problems is preventing close to 2 million low-income children from getting affordable health coverage, according to a report from the\u00a0American Action Forum,\u00a0a f", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/obama1.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe016c\"", "article_summary": "The so-called \u201cfamily glitch\u201d is a well-known problem with Obamacare\u2019s treatment of what it means for an employer to offer affordable health coverage.\nKaiser Family Foundation has estimated that the average cost of health coverage for families is as high as $15,700 per year.\nThe health-care law doesn\u2019t offer subsidies to workers whose employer offers what the federal government deems affordable coverage \u2014 but doesn\u2019t consider whether employer coverage for workers\u2019 families is affordable as well.\nWhile CHIP is supposed to help those who don\u2019t earn enough to purchase their own children health insurance but earn too much for Medicaid coverage, Obamacare doesn\u2019t have its own solution for children\u2019s coverage.\n(REUTERS/Larry Downing)4234434One of Obamacare\u2019s ongoing structural problems is preventing close to 2 million low-income children from getting affordable health coverage, according to a report from the American Action Forum, a free market think tank."}
