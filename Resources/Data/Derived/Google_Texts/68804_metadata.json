Certain models of home visiting, including the Nurse Family Partnership (NFP) and Child First, have demonstrated a positive impact on preventing emergency room visits and suspected child maltreatment.\n\nThe program will sunset without a reauthorization before next year.\n\n\u201cWith the reauthorization of that program pending, it\u2019s time to review whether it is really making that hoped-for difference,\u201d said Ways and Means Chairman David Reichert, in his announcement of the hearing.\n\n\n\nThe investment has likely yielded significant social impact, but may be too inclusive of unproven programs and lacks evidence of cost savings, according to the testimony of representatives from two public policy organizations.\n\nThe Coalition for Evidence-Based Policy \u201cstrongly supports\u201d the reauthorization of MIECHV, said President Jon Baron, who said the program differentiated itself from many federal programs by limiting spending to certain models that have been rigorously tested.\n\nBaron also suggested that a the list of allowable models could be further pared to exclude those with evaluations showing \u201cstatistically significant\u201d results but no \u201cpolicy or practical importance.\u201d\n\nHe named four models that lacked evidence of strong results: Healthy Steps; Healthy Families America; Parents as Teachers; and the Comprehensive Child Development Program, which was actually developed by HHS.\n\nRand Corporation Economist M. Rebecca Kilburn told the subcommittee that a \u201cdiverse set of home visiting models\u201d can improve outcomes for individual families. She expects the federal evaluation of MIECHV to reveal potential broader impacts, such as a measurable drop in entitlement spending or the size of a foster care system.\n\n\u201cDespite the large growth of in-home visiting funding at the national and state levels, not enough families are currently served to be able to detect impacts in population level data,\u201d Kliburn said.\n\nAnd while some cost-benefit analyses show return on investment, she said, only five of the 14 MIECHV models have even been subjected to a cost-benefit analysis.\n\nThe first results of the MIECHV evaluation should be released in 2015.\n\nThe committee heard direct reflections on the impact of home visiting from Crystal Towne, a nurse home visitor with the Nurse Family Partnership in Yakima Valley, Wash., and Sherene Sucilla, one of her clients.\n\nSucilla had spent her teenage years in foster care and was 10 weeks pregnant when she began the two-year, 64 appointment commitment with NFP. She credited Towne with helping her continue her education, strengthen her family and connect her to a career.\n\n\u201cAs I look toward my future, I don\u2019t think my family would be where we are today without her support,\u201d Sucilla said.\n\n\u201cStories like Sherene\u2019s are just a glimpse of the impact that Nurse-Family Partnership has on low-income, first-time parents,\u201d Towne said. \u201cNFP can help break the cycle of poverty by empowering young mothers to become knowledgeable parents.\u201d\n\nClick here to read all of the testimony from the hearing.\n\nJohn Kelly is the editor-in-chief of The Chronicle of Social Change.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Chronicle of Social Change", "description": "The Affordable Care Act (ACA) included a major federal investment in home visitation programs, which support new and expectant mothers by sending trained workers and/or health professionals into homes.
