They led a party-line vote to reject Democrats\u2019 attempts to add it to the proposed spending plan.\n\nRepresentative Randy Dunn (D-Kansas City), during budget debate, called that rejection, \u201cboneheaded,\u201d and, \u201cinhumane.\u201d\n\n\u201cI say it\u2019s boneheaded because we have over 300-thousand Missourians, over 50-percent from rural communities, who are currently uninsured but would be [insured] with expansion of Medicaid. It is boneheaded not to expand Medicaid because conservative numbers show it would create over 24-thousand new jobs here in Missouri. It is boneheaded not to expand Medicaid because each year that we don\u2019t we are turning our backs on over $2-billion in tax money paid by Missouri residents from coming back to this state,\u201d said Dunn.\n\nHouse Speaker Todd Richardson (R-Poplar Bluff) took exception with Dunn\u2019s choice of words, and accused Democrats of ignoring facts.\n\n\u201cMedicaid is bankrupting this state right now with existing eligibility limits. We have gone in a period of the last 15-months that we have added more than 60-thousand people to Missouri Medicaid. Our Medicaid spending \u2013 just the state General Revenue portion \u2013 up 26-percent in the last seven years,\u201d said Richardson. \u201cThe discussion needs to point back to Medicaid \u2026 because it\u2019s consuming this budget \u2026 so the solution to that is to add more people to a broken program?\u201d\n\nThe budget proposal heads to the Senate, where Republican leadership shares shares the opposition to Medicaid Expansion.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Missourinet", "description": "The state Senate this week will begin work with the budget proposed by the House that continues Republicans\u2019 opposition to expanding Medicaid.
