Top health lobbyist calls it quits at key moment for Obamacare\n\nKaren Ignagni was the woman who could have killed Obamacare.\n\nInstead, the nation\u2019s top health insurance lobbyist helped President Barack Obama to pass his sweeping health reform. And she became emblematic of the compromises and controversies that still define the Affordable Care Act today.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nIgnagni announced her departure from America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans on Thursday. After more than two decades as a D.C. lobbying powerhouse, she\u2019s going to run EmblemHealth, a big New York insurer.\n\nShe leaves at a watershed moment. Next month, the Supreme Court in King v. Burwell will decide whether people in states using the federal health exchange can keep getting government subsidies to buy insurance, or whether the financial assistance should only be allowed in states running their own Obamacare markets. A defeat for the administration would mean millions of people could lose their subsidies \u2014 and the insurance industry would face vast disruption.\n\nIt\u2019s not her first big moment.\n\nIgnagni was in charge of AHIP when the health insurance industry confronted its biggest policy challenge in 2009. It could kill health reform, as the health plans did during the Bill Clinton administration. Or it could embrace it \u2014 and try to shape it. Ultimately, the industry, with Ignagni at the helm, decided to back the Affordable Care Act, which reshaped how her industry operates.\n\n\u201cIt required the insurance industry to be behind it,\u201d said Joe Antos, a health care policy expert at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. \u201cIt was absolutely essential.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t always an easy alliance. It was later revealed that AHIP spent big behind the scenes to derail health reform legislation as it was being drafted, sending $86 million to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce to oppose the law. But Ignagni\u2019s outward support helped build confidence in the drive for reform.\n\nIgnagni\u2019s resignation marks the latest in a string of high-profile exoduses from Washington\u2019s most powerful health care trade associations \u2014some of whom joined Ignagni in playing significant roles in the passage and then the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. John Castellani has announced that he will retire as president and CEO of drug trade group PhRMA at the end of the year. Rich Umbdenstock, the president and CEO of the American Hospital Association, also plans to retire this year.\n\nBut Ignagni, one of the most powerful and visible women in the lobbying industry, who received roughly $2 million in compensation in 2013, was arguably the biggest player of the three.\n\nSome conservatives regard her as an Obamacare enabler, submitting the industry to vast government oversight in exchange for new customers receiving millions in federal subsidies. At the other end of the spectrum, progressives saw her defending for-profit insurers that made out like gangbusters under a flawed health law that could have done even more for consumers.\n\n\u201cShe knew that the industry would do better under the law,\u201d said Wendell Potter, a former insurance official turned consumer watchdog with the Center for Public Integrity. \u201cShe was able to envision, even with the new consumer protections, that the industry would get many billions of dollars in new revenue that can be converted into profits, and that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s happened.\u201d\n\nBut neither side underestimates her power or effectiveness. She may have the calm demeanor and soothing voice of a yoga instructor, but she\u2019s packed with the intelligence and savvy to eviscerate opponents\u2019 policy positions with a smile.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard not to argue that she was one of the most successful and effective advocates for an industry in the last 20 years. She\u2019s just an absolute powerhouse shaper of policy in this town for an industry that\u2019s not really loved,\u201d said John Gorman, an insurance consultant and former Clinton administration official.\n\nThat lack of love was one of the levers Obama pushed as he began to stir up support for health reform. He bashed the insurers, saying lax laws and a broken system enabled them to dump customers after a cancer diagnosis or deny treatment. The industry took it on the chin, but later decided to work \u2014 most of the time \u2014 with the White House on reform.\n\nAfter the law passed, much of the public animosity fell away.\n\nThere are still significant points of contention: The industry hates a health insurance tax that helps finance Obamacare, and was incensed when the administration allowed once-canceled plans to continue to operate beyond 2014, which cost the industry big bucks. AHIP has also been rallying Democratic and Republican lawmakers each year to oppose the law\u2019s massive cuts to private Medicare health plans.\n\nBut on the regulatory minutiae required to implement a major piece of legislation, Obama administration officials and the insurance industry largely worked together on a shared goal: making an extraordinarily complicated law work in a hostile political environment.\n\nIgnagni, who did not respond to an email Thursday, has defended the health law \u2014 though not without caveats. It provides millions of Americans with \u201cthe peace of mind that health insurance provides,\u201d she said soon after that rough first enrollment season. But challenges of affordability and access remain. In the last few months, a lot of her focus was not on the health law but the soaring prices of prescription drugs, and the risks of rising health care prices from hospital mergers and consolidation.\n\nPeople who have watched her understand why she might want to try her hand at actually running a health plan.\n\nJay Gellert, president and CEO of Health Net, an AHIP member company, said after all that Ignagni had accomplished in setting up the regulatory infrastructure for the ACA in Washington, she had to be tempted to play it out on the ground.\n\n\u201cAfter advocating for something like this, it\u2019s fun to actually do it,\u201d Gellert said. She \u201creally believes in this broader idea of quality coverage for all.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe was the face of the industry when it was attacked,\u201d Gellert said \u201cWithout compromising her beliefs, she handled all of that with integrity and dignity, and I think that was because form the start she was committed to the end point.\u201d\n\nAHIP\u2019s board is launching a national search for her successor. AHIP said Dan Durham, executive vice president for strategic initiatives, was appointed as interim CEO.\n\nVeteran headhunter Ivan Adler said the top job at AHIP \u2014 which was born out of the 2003 merger of Health Insurance Association of America and American Association of Health Plans, which Ignagni headed \u2014 will be much sought after.\n\n\u201cThe AHIP job is one of the more sexier jobs in Washington,\u201d Adler said. \u201cHigh profile with lots of internal and external resources and the comp doesn\u2019t hurt either.\u201d\n\nIgnagni led American Association of Health for 10 years before becoming head of AHIP after its merger with Health Insurance Association of America. She got her start in politics as an aide to then-Sen. Claiborne Pell (D-R.I.) and also worked at the AFL-CIO as director of its employee benefits\n\nEmblemHealth sent out an announcement of the move after POLITICO first reported Thursday about her departure.\n\nShe will serve as president and CEO of the company starting Sept. 1., although she\u2019s expected to leave AHIP in early June, before the Supreme Court ruling.\n\nAnna Palmer contributed reporting.", "article_metadata": {"description": "She has been a powerhouse in the insurance industry for decades.", "og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "She has been a powerhouse in the insurance industry for decades.", "title": "Top health lobbyist calls it quits at key moment for Obamacare", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/05/karen-ignagni-leaving-ahip-118182.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2015/05/21/150521_karen_ignagni_gty_1160.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "keywords": "Obamacare,Karen Ignagni,Health Care,America's Health Insurance Plans,Affordable Care Act,Emblem Health", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/Annapalmerpolitico/"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Top health lobbyist calls it quits at key moment for ObamacareKaren Ignagni was the woman who could have killed Obamacare.\nInstead, the nation\u2019s top health insurance lobbyist helped President Barack Obama to pass his sweeping health reform.\nStory Continued BelowIgnagni announced her departure from America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans on Thursday.\nIt could kill health reform, as the health plans did during the Bill Clinton administration.\n\u201cIt required the insurance industry to be behind it,\u201d said Joe Antos, a health care policy expert at the conservative American Enterprise Institute."}
