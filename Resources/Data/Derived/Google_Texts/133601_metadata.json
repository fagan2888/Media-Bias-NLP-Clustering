(John Sommers/Reuters)\n\nKentucky is poised to become the first state to shutter its fully functional independent health care exchange, if Republican Gov.-elect Matt Bevin makes good on one of his campaign promises.\n\nBevin had pledged to shut down Kynect, which was built under the Affordable Care Act through an executive order by outgoing Gov. Steve Beshear, a move that would force more than 500,000 Kentuckians to enroll in the federal exchange instead. In a video posted on his campaign website, he says the Healthcare.gov marketplace makes Kentucky's program redundant.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing we offer to our citizens at the state level that they can\u2019t get at the federal level,\u201d said Bevin, who was elected on Tuesday. \u201cThe only thing we can guarantee is it\u2019s going to cost taxpayers in this state more.\u201d\n\nKynect has been considered a success story of the ACA, even as other states, like Hawaii and Oregon, shuttered their state-based exchanges due to technical woes. But even if Bevin issues an executive order to end the state exchange, Kynect wouldn't immediately go dark: Beshear's administration estimated this summer that the process would take nine months and cost roughly $23 million.\n\nAnd while the state used $283 million in federal funds to build Kynect, the money to tear it down would have to come out of the state\u2019s general fund. Al Cross, director of the Institute for Rural Journalism and Community Issues at the University of Kentucky, told StateScoop that even if the administration's estimate is inflated, \"the budget situation is so bad that they can\u2019t afford to throw that away.\" Kentucky has approximately $86.2 billion in state debt.\n\n\u201cIt would be dumb to do away with Kynect. It\u2019s a national model,\u201d Cross said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to spend state taxpayer money to tear down something that\u2019s built with federal money.\u201d\n\nThe move could also cut the jobs of hundreds of workers who help people enroll in the exchange, said Emily Beauregard, executive director of the nonprofit Kentucky Voices for Health.\n\n\u201cThey live and work in the communities they serve all across Kentucky,\u201d Beauregard said. \u201cThese people have really become trusted resources.\u201d\n\nBeauregard said Kynect\u2019s state-specific \u201coutreach and education\u201d efforts would also shut down in favor of a federal outreach program that has to allocate resources for the 37 other states using Healthcare.gov.\n\nMeanwhile, some Kentucky politics experts question whether the public backs Bevin\u2019s Kynect plans. The businessman's victory over Democrat Jack Conway may not translate to support for Bevin's position on the exchange, according to Steve Voss, an associate professor of political science at the University of Kentucky.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really skeptical this was about economic or domestic policy,\u201d Voss said. \u201cI think this is far more likely about social and cultural issues that really didn\u2019t speak directly to the question of the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\nIn fact, a Bluegrass Poll showed that 54 percent of respondents supported Beshear\u2019s actions on health care. Similarly, a poll by the Foundation for a Health Kentucky showed that roughly 40 percent of respondents had a favorable view of the federal health care law. Yet, Voss said some of the polls showing that support \u201cwere also the polls that showed Bevin losing the race.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight now, we don\u2019t have a lot of good information on where the Kentucky electorate stands,\u201d Voss said. \u201cAnother possibility is maybe the majority of the public vaguely wants it, but a significant amount of the people who actually show up in an off-year election don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nIt's possible that the Legislature could act to codify the state exchange into law when it reconvenes in January \u2014 making it harder for the newly elected governor to dismantle the program. Yet Voss said he'd be \"shocked\" if lawmakers could secure a majority on the issue, and the Legislature may not have time to take it up.\n\n\"The state legislative agenda was already quite crowded,\" said Jasmine Farrier, an associate professor of political science at the University of Louisville. \"You have pension reform, tax reform, other major questions that are facing Kentucky.\"\n\nBut Cross notes that Bevin could always have a change of heart about Kynect once he's in office.\n\n\u201cI think is going to be a test of pragmatism versus ideology,\u201d Cross said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense to do away with Kynect unless you want to make a political point.\u201d\n\nContact the reporter who wrote this story at alex.koma@statescoop.com, or follow him on Twitter at @AlexKomaSNG.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://statescoop.com/kentuckys-healthcare-exchange-faces-uncertain-future-following-gov-election", "image": "http://s3.amazonaws.com/statescoop-media/uploads/2015-11-2015-11-04T012847Z_1_LYNXNPEBA3013_RTROPTP_3_USA-ELECTION-GOVERNORS-616x401.jpg?mtime=20160120170238", "site_name": "StateScoop", "description": "The victory of Republican Matt Bevin, who's pledged to dismantle the state-based exchange, has experts concerned for the system's survival.", "title": "Kentucky's health care exchange faces uncertain future following governor race"}, "description": "The victory of Republican Matt Bevin, who's pledged to dismantle the state-based exchange, has experts concerned for the system's survival.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Similarly, a poll by the Foundation for a Health Kentucky showed that roughly 40 percent of respondents had a favorable view of the federal health care law.\nSteve Beshear, a move that would force more than 500,000 Kentuckians to enroll in the federal exchange instead.\n(John Sommers/Reuters)Kentucky is poised to become the first state to shutter its fully functional independent health care exchange, if Republican Gov.-elect Matt Bevin makes good on one of his campaign promises.\nBevin had pledged to shut down Kynect, which was built under the Affordable Care Act through an executive order by outgoing Gov.\nThe victory of Republican Matt Bevin, who's pledged to dismantle the state-based exchange, has experts concerned for the system's survival."}
