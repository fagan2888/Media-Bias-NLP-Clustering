Mary Landrieu (D-LA) voting with President Obama 95% of the time and whether that is helpful to minorities. Dash\u2019s answer guaranteed she\u2019ll be invited back on Hannity\n\nHannity asked, \"Has voting with Obama 95% of the time and ObamaCare \u2013 has that helped the minority community in Louisiana in your view?\n\nThe Bronx-born Dash did nothing to indicate she knows a single thing about Louisiana \u2013 or anything else beyond Fox News talking points. \u201cNo, not at all.\u201d Dash said quickly, without bothering to offer a single fact in support of her opinion. Instead, she came up with the kind of soundbite that could have been pre-scripted for her by just about any of the other Fox News African American black attackers.\n\nDash \"explained\": \u201cBecause it still keeps them stuck. They\u2019re getting money for free, they feel worthless, they\u2019re uneducated. I mean, as long as you\u2019re that way, they can keep you under their control. \u2026They (the Democratic Party) have a plantation mentality. As long as I give you this much money, you\u2019ll stay right there. You don\u2019t need to know too much because if you do, you might start thinking for yourself.\u201d\n\nYou have to wonder if Dash really came up with this \u201cthought\u201d on her own. Fox News contributor \u2013 and hate monger extraordinaire \u2013 Allen West famously referred to Democratic black leaders as \u201coverseers of this 21st century plantation\u201d and boasted about himself as a \u201cmodern day Harriet Tubman\u201d who would lead people \u201caway from that plantation into a sense of sensibility.\u201d\n\nFox will never care if Dash ever comes up with an original thought or an informative comment. She says just the kinds of things about African Americans they love - and that's all the substance they care about.\n\nWatch the discussion below, from the October 14 Hannity, via Media Matters.", "article_metadata": {"csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "google-site-verification": "google51c0b549f514d464.html", "csrf-token": "DZpxdn6JiHw380mP4OT3lEDySqtIdmDhy/NiLdL6bGo=", "og": {"url": "http://www.newshounds.us/stacey_dash_accuses_democrats_of_having_a_plantation_mentality_toward_minorities_10152014", "site_name": "NewsHounds", "image": "http://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/newshounds/sites/1/meta_images/original/Newshound3_blue.png?1327001871", "type": "article", "title": "Stacey Dash Accuses Democrats Of Having A \u2018Plantation Mentality\u2019 Toward Minorities"}, "Title": "Stacey Dash Accuses Democrats Of Having A \u2018Plantation Mentality\u2019 Toward Minorities"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb8fa\"", "article_summary": "Stacey Dash was asked by Sean Hannity about Sen.
