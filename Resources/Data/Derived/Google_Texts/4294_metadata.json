The answers are as we received them, minus some small grammatical and editing changes.\n\nBedford\n\nIan Charles, Green. Did not respond.\n\n*Kelly Regan, Liberal. I've worked hard to represent all Bedford citizens. Together, we delivered a better high school, improved Lyme disease awareness, and halted the Bedford Waterfront infill. If re-elected, I\u2019ll work just as hard to reduce health wait times, improve our school system, control power rates, and secure a better waterfront.\n\nMike Poworoznyk, NDP: I have a strong community development background, bringing people together on poverty reduction, improved health care, and awareness of mental health. My focus is helping people. NDP policies put people first . As your NDP MLA, I would connect with Bedford residents more regularly and work for their better future.\n\nJoan Christie PC: I would offer as your MLA, to continue my tradition of getting things done for Bedford. I\u2019ve been the volunteer who sees a need, then works co-operatively with all concerned to get an acceptable solution to the problem. Elect me as a strong voice and worker for Bedford.\n\nChester-St. Margaret\u2019s\n\nTimothy Harris, Liberal: From eight years in the Arctic in construction, I know about hard work. Building Tradewinds from a one-man realty office to a province-wide company has given me experience in small business. Our future lies in educating our children, giving them tools and skills for good jobs in Nova Scotia. I think outside the box, and want to help build a prosperous future for Chester-St. Margaret\u2019s.\n\n*Denise Peterson-Rafuse, NDP: Since 2009, Denise Peterson-Rafuse has worked hard to make life better in Chester St. Margaret's. She fought for more than $28 million for road improvements, buying back the Bowater lands and improvements to health care. Denise is committed to working with you to build a better future for today's families.\n\nJanet Irwin, PC: Janet Irwin is the Progressive Conservative candidate in Chester-St. Margaret's. As a journalist at the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation for 31 years, Janet gave voice to people's concerns. As MLA, Janet will give voice to her constituents' concerns and work to build a better future for all in Chester-St. Margaret's.\n\nClayton Park West\n\n*Diana Whalen, Liberal: Clayton Park West is my home and community. As MLA for ten years, I have worked with you to address our needs. Our successes include the Canada Games Centre and preservation of wilderness. With your support on October 8th, I will continue building a safe and vibrant Clayton Park.\n\nBlake Wright, NDP: As a parent and an immigrant I understand the challenges and dreams of Clayton Park West residents. As a lawyer, I have regularly taken action to be both a voice and advocate for all, and have a record of getting things done fairly. I will do the same for you.\n\nJamie Allen, PC: Clayton Park West: NS needs change. We cannot keep on doing what we have always been doing, as it is not working. I am not looking to be a politician, but to be a leader at the provincial level, to help make the long-term changes that we need. I ask for your support.\n\nColchester-Musquodoboit Valley\n\nTom Martin, Liberal: Life experience would set me aside from the other candidates. Years of public service as a homicide investigator and hostage negotiator coupled with private sector experience as a national director for a local company and owning two small businesses in rural NS creates a unique skill set as a candidate.\n\n*Gary Burrill, NDP: Had the NDP not been elected in 2009, we wouldn\u2019t have seen improvements like expanded children\u2019s dental care coverage, Collaborative Emergency Centres, the first Mental Health Strategy, ambulance fees abolished for lower-income families, and the elimination of provincial income tax for seniors receiving the Supplement. We need to continue along this path.\n\nLarry Harrison, PC: Larry Harrison has a solid university education, deep community roots and is a well-respected volunteer on many groups including palliative care at the Colchester \u2013 East Hants Health Centre. A retired Reverend, he led congregations at Knox United Church in Brookfield and Middle Stewiacke United Church. He resides in Shorts Lake with his wife Susanne.\n\nCole Harbour-Eastern Passage\n\nJoyce Treen, Liberal: I am proud to call Cole Harbour-Eastern Passage my home. I am someone who has been, and continues to be, deeply rooted and committed to this community. First and foremost, I live, work and volunteer in the community. This gives me an appreciation for the issues we face and a passion to make a positive difference in our community.\n\n*Becky Kent, NDP: As MLA for the past 6 years, my skills and experience have proven to be effective on priorities in our communities such as our new EP High School, renovations to Cole Harbour High, economic development and healthy living initiatives. These skills will be even more important in the coming years.\n\nLloyd Jackson: PC: Serving in the Canadian Military since 1988, Major Jackson has served in such diverse postings as Sudan, Sierra Leone, the Golan Heights and Afghanistan. In the community, Lloyd has coached girls and boys minor basketball, and served as Association President. He has served on various School Advisory Committees.\n\nCole Harbour-Portland Valley\n\nTony Ince, Liberal: I am a conscientious and hard working person. As a youth worker, I have first-hand knowledge of the challenges our community faces. I have been successful bringing together diverse people of differing opinions, helping them find creative solutions. I know together we can strengthen Cole Harbour Portland Valley community.\n\n*Darrell Dexter, NDP: I've worked hard to improve opportunities for young people to find recreation, sports and support services. The trades centre at Cole Harbour High is a milestone achievement that will prepare young people for jobs in shipbuilding, marine technology and innovative resource industries and much progress has been made on jobs, healthcare and seniors issues.\n\nGreg Frampton, PC: I am a business person and have served from 1997 to 2010 working in the departments of municipal affairs, tourism, economic development and community services. My interests include improving customer services in government, creating an optimal environment for job growth, and working toward a bright future for Nova Scotia.\n\nDartmouth East\n\n*Andrew Younger, Liberal: As MLA I've worked with our community members to get things done, and represent your concerns in the legislature. I believe in creating an environment where young people stay in this province, where innovation is celebrated, and where community needs are supported. I ask for your support on Oct. 8.\n\nDeborah Stover, NDP: As your MLA, I would take the same approach to politics as I do to nursing \u2013 help everyone I can who is in need. The NDP is working on making Nova Scotia stronger, and Dartmouth East deserves an MLA focused on that goal.\n\nMike Macdonell, PC: Did not respond.\n\nDartmouth North\n\nJoanne Bernard, Liberal: I live and work in Dartmouth North and have developed programs that have changed the lives of many people in this community. As a former single mother on social assistance, I have faced many hardships in my life. I'm committed to economic development and social justice and will be a strong voice in government.\n\nSteven Estey, NDP: In my work with the United Nations, I have successfully fought for people who have been pushed aside by society. I want to bring that experience to our community. Dartmouth North needs the NDP to continue competing for good jobs, increasing the minimum wage, and strengthening health care.\n\nSean Brownlow, PC: As a former police sergeant, I understand the importance of helping others and working with the three levels of government to create a better community. I am committed to affordable housing for seniors and improvements to our education system. Every important community concern will be my concern.\n\nPreston-Dartmouth\n\n*Keith Colwell, Liberal. Did not respond.\n\nAndre Cain, NDP: Preston-Dartmouth is my community. Growing up, I was given opportunity, and learned responsibility. I earned a law degree, joined the Human Rights Commission and served as a volunteer to give back. Now I want to work for better health care, education, skills training and jobs here for our youth.\n\nAndrew Mecke, PC. Did not respond.\n\nDartmouth South\n\nJames (Jim) Anthony Murray, Independent: I feel I can best represent the people of Dartmouth South because I know every day what it\u2019s like to tighten the belt, or worry about the next NSP rate increase. Like many here, I am working-class, and can more than relate to their situation, unlike the Big 3.\n\nAllan Rowe, Liberal: I'm prepared to listen to the constituents, hear their concerns and advice, and then speak and act for them accordingly and effectively in our house of assembly. The Liberal party will put Nova Scotians first. If elected, I will put those Nova Scotians who live in Dartmouth South, first.\n\nMary Vingoe, NDP: We have in Nova Scotia 8,000 fewer people living in poverty and the highest credit rating this province has ever had. We have improved access to health care, supported seniors, protected our environment, invested in childcare, capped class sizes and have a clear plan for green, stable, sustainable energy.\n\nGordon Gamble, PC: Gord Gamble has 25 years of successful business experience. He has served his community as Chair of the Board for Feed Nova Scotia, President of the Rotary Club of Dartmouth and coached many youth in our community. He has a proven record of getting things done for others.\n\nEastern Shore\n\nKevin Murphy, Liberal: I have lived worked and contributed to the Eastern Shore since 1978. I care about the Eastern Shore and want to work for the betterment of our communities. I see great potential for our region and want to bring positive change. I ask for your vote on Oct. 8.\n\n*Sid Prest, NDP: It has been a privilege to serve the people of the Eastern Shore as the NDP MLA. People tell me my strong work ethic and my approachable - hands on \u2013 style to community issues is a big reason why they\u2019ll vote for me again this election.\n\nSteve Brine, PC: As your former elected school board member I achieved results, including saving Atlantic View School from closure, fighting for a skilled trades program at ESDH and courtesy busing for the safety of our children. As your MLA I will continue to dedicate my time to fight for \u201cThe Forgotten Shore.\u201d\n\nFairview-Clayton Park\n\nRaland Kinley, Green: As a Green candidate, I can offer my undivided attention to the issues that concern you. I am not a professional politician. I am a concerned resident. We need to collectively invest in education, renewable energy, active living, public transit and reform government. This is the path to future prosperity.\n\nKatie Campbell, Independent: I work, so I can live with a measure of comfort. I pay taxes for public programs (health, education, safety, etc.). I vote and support law making if it represents interests of the society I live in. I'm running because the system's not working.\n\nPatricia Arab, Liberal: As a teacher and guidance counselor, I am committed to listening and working with you to improve our schools, make our healthcare more accessible, and help our businesses succeed. I will be a strong voice for Fairview-Clayton Park while maintaining a positive and respectful approach to politics. Please join me.\n\nAbad Khan, NDP: I grew up in Fairview and Clayton Park, attending Halifax West High School and working in the family business on Dutch Village Road. Because of this I feel that I understand the issues facing voters in this riding. I've enjoyed getting to meet my neighbours during the campaign.\n\nTravis Price, PC: As the co-founder of Pink Shirt Day I am a proven leader. I have shown my ability and commitment to stand up and make change happen, in my own community and worldwide. If I have the privilege of becoming your MLA I will do the same for Fairview-Clayton Park.\n\nHalifax Armdale\n\nLena Diab, Liberal: I offer a balance of vision, energy and experience delivering results. I have served the community for 22 years as a trusted lawyer as well as 30 years in business. I am also a compassionate life-long volunteer. All combined have given me the skills and desire to effect positive change.\n\nDrew Moore, NDP: I will work hard every day to deliver results for the people of Halifax Armdale. I will work with our community groups and fight for our families and seniors. I will stand up in the legislature and ensure the voices of the community I love are heard. Every single day.\n\nIrvine Carvery, PC: Halifax Armdale needs an MLA who will listen to their concerns. Three local schools have leaking roofs. Old-growth neighbourhoods are being redeveloped without proper consultation. Homes are being expropriated for roads without adequate planning. Halifax needs leadership and partnership on urban issues. Irvine Carvery will stand up for Halifax Armdale.\n\nHalifax Atlantic\n\nBrendan Maguire, Liberal: For me, running is personal. I was raised in foster care in Halifax Atlantic \u2013 Spryfield, Harrietsfield and Herring Cove, and without their support, I wouldn\u2019t be who I am. I know this community, I love this community and I\u2019ll work for this community. It\u2019s time for me to give back.\n\nTanis Crosby, NDP: Raised by a low-income, single mother and now raising a family of my own, I know firsthand how the right supports can change lives. I have delivered results as a leader in the nonprofit sector, as a community volunteer, and I am ready to take that record to the legislature.\n\nRyan Brennan, PC: I am the best choice for MLA in Halifax Atlantic because I understand the issues better than my opponents. I have deep roots and a proven track record working with the community and delivering results. Our platform lowers taxes, freezes power rates and creates jobs for Nova Scotia.\n\nHalifax Chebucto\n\nMichael Marshall, Independent. I am running in opposition to plans to centralize the administration of all of NS rural hospitals in some big concrete tower in downtown Halifax. I do not think either Halifax Chebucto or rural Nova Scotia would be better off if everyone lives in expensive housing in HRM while rural Nova Scotia is reduced to summertime cottage country.\n\nJoachim Stroink, Liberal: I am deeply invested in this community and want it to thrive: I went to the same school that my kids now go to and own the Trail Shop. I helped save the Oval, was Race Director of the Bluenose Marathon for four years, and chaired the Learning Disabilities Association.\n\nGregor Ash, NDP: I\u2019m working hard to become the next MLA for Halifax-Chebucto because I want to build a stronger community and a better future for Nova Scotian families. If elected, I will use my proven record of bringing people and ideas together to advance the things that matter most, like healthcare, education and the environment.\n\nChristine Dewell PC: I'm looking for change within our education system. It's key that when our kids walk through their school doors, they feel safe, and that they are active, healthy and empowered to make smart choices. Equally as important, we must ensure that our teachers are supported with the proper tools to foster success.\n\nHalifax Citadel-Sable Island\n\nBrynn Horley, Green; A vote for Brynn Horley and the Green Party of Nova Scotia is a vote for the only party focused on our shared long-term futures. We recognize that implementing Full Cost Accounting is essential to our decision making process to ensure thriving healthy communities, environmental stewardship, and economic viability.\n\nFrederic Boileau-Cadieux, Independent: During the past 30 years in the western world, politicians\u2019 policies have worked against the working class. Democracy is about having the electors control the elected. Right now, it is the complete opposite. Atlantica\u2019s platform is truly democratic. That is why I am in the campaign.\n\nLabi Kousoulis, Liberal: I've been canvassing since January. People tell me things need to improve. Liberals will invest in local businesses, not write blank cheques to large corporations. We will refocus healthcare to provide seniors with the services they need. The Liberal Graduate Retention Program will help students stay here and succeed here.\n\n*Leonard Preyra, NDP: For many years I have participated in our community as an activist, academic and MLA. Our community comes first and my door is always open to anyone who wishes to make life better in our province. It would be an honour to return as your MLA.\n\nAndrew Black, PC: We lost 4,272 Nova Scotians in 12 months. They will not shop in our stores, ride our buses, attend our theatres, eat in our restaurants or pay taxes that support our services. More than ever we need to live within our means and make our province competitive.\n\nHalifax Needham\n\nKris MacLellan, Green: Elizabeth May. Andrew Weaver. Across this country, Green Party candidates are being elected and bringing their perspectives and passions to the legislative process. Halifax Needham is the perfect place to launch a Green voice into Nova Scotia\u2019s politics, and I ask for your support on Election Day #votegreen.\n\nChris Poole, Liberal: My roots are here, I work here and I'm raising my family here. I care about our health, opportunity for our children and stability in our lives. I have the experience to guide government in making decisions that better our community and the youth, energy and passion to deliver it.\n\n*Maureen MacDonald, NDP: I like people. The extensive experience and knowledge I have acquired as MLA, Minister of Health then Minister of Finance will allow me to continue to represent residents on our many complex issues of healthcare, education, the province\u2019s finances, housing, the environment, the arts, diversity and social justice.\n\nMary Hamblin, PC: I\u2019ll work toward a vision where Halifax Needham embraces all persons helping each and every resident to achieve their full potential. I see increased opportunities and prosperity for all in this vibrant community. I lived and worked here as a single mother, business owner, teacher, mature student (Dalhousie MBA-Law), advocate, and screenwriter.\n\nHammonds Plains-Lucasville\n\nJonathan Dean, Independent: Looming depopulation, collapsing electoral turnout, chronic malaise. Nova Scotia is the sick man of Canada. We need real substantive change. The tired Big 3 stand for status quo, we (Atlantica) stand for a grand new vision for this grand old province; Prosperity & Democracy. Vote Atlantica and let\u2019s get going.\n\nBen Jessome, Liberal: I am confident I am the best choice in HPL because I have a firm understanding of our challenges and strengths, combined with demonstrated experience in government relations, community development and elected representation. I am committed to protecting our integrity as we continue to grow. Elect Ben Jessome, homegrown representation.\n\nPeter Lund, NDP: There is no other candidate who recognizes our communities needs better than me. As HRM councillor, I worked with three MLAs to bring in the new high school, BMO centre and finally widen Hammonds Plains Road. There is more to do and I am ready to hit the ground running.\n\nGina Byrne, PC: As the PC candidate for HPL I know I bring the most business, governance, life and local experience to the constituency. As a mother, volunteer and business owner I know what a change in the economy will provide. I want to put my dedication and experience to work for you.\n\nSackville-Beaver Bank\n\nStephen Gough, Liberal: I am the best candidate to represent Sackville-Beaver Bank because I will be the strongest voice for our residents. As a life-long resident of this riding I am aware of our concerns, our strengths and our needs as we move forward. I commit to being your voice.\n\n*Mat Whynott, NDP: For me politics is about both our province and our people doing well. I have two young children and what I want for them I want for all families. As your representative I will continue to work with you to make Sackville-Beaver Bank even stronger for all our families.\n\nSarah Reeves, PC: Only the PC Party has a plan that addresses the priorities of hard working families. We\u2019ll lower taxes like the HST and freeze power rates; stop the wasteful spending that has taken dollars from front-line health care and education; and create an environment for job creation, not corporate handouts.\n\nSackville-Cobequid\n\nJohn H. Percy, Green: Did not respond.\n\nGraham Cameron, Liberal: I\u2019m committed to helping my community to grow and prosper. It\u2019s time for change; time to put Nova Scotia first. I want to be your voice in the NS legislature to address the concerns facing our community. A Liberal government will put you first on health care, education and jobs.\n\n*Dave Wilson, NDP: Sackville is where I grew up, work and am raising my family. I know and understand the issues facing families in our community. I will continue to work hard to maintain your trust and together we can build our community to benefit all our families.\n\nPeter MacIsaac, PC: As a government employee for 29 years and small business owner since I was 10, I have seen the problems with government. We have good people working in a broken bureaucracy. With your help, we can improve front line care, lower taxes, and put money back in your pocket.\n\nTimberlea-Prospect\n\nThomas Trappenberg, Green: I am a scientist, a teacher, a father, and much more, but I am not a politician. I am running so that you can stand up. Try it; it feels good to vote for a vision. This is for our kids and not a lost vote.\n\nIain Rankin, Liberal: I have grown up and reside in Timberlea-Prospect. I understand the diverse needs of each of our distinct communities. My community commitment is well known in environmental circles, the business community, and by participating in the many local community events. My business background will be a great asset in government, with ideas to make government more efficient.\n\nLinda Moxsom-Skinner, NDP: I\u2019m the best choice for Timberlea-Prospect because I will bring my experience, skills and knowledge as an entrepreneur, fundraiser, and community volunteer and senior political advisor to continue Bill Estabrooks\u2019 tradition of being a truly accessible and accountable MLA for the people of Timberlea-Prospect.\n\nBruce Pretty, PC: Did not respond\n\nWaverley-Fall River-Beaver Bank\n\nBill Horne, Liberal: An advocate and volunteer for 40 years in the riding presently involved in 10 groups, past chair of Lions, and chair of WAAA McDonald park and emergency preparedness team, v-chair of SWEPS, member of six other groups. I am also a former Halifax County councillor and Liberal candidate for the riding in 2009.\n\n*Percy Paris, NDP: As your MLA for the last eight years I have worked to improve healthcare, youth recreational facilities, schools and rebuild the Beaver Bank Community Hall. I am proud of our accomplishments. I have the experience needed to successfully advocate for the issues that are important for building a stronger community.\n\nBrian Wong, PC: This community has lost so many opportunities under its current representation. My background as an educator and entrepreneur gives me the experience to lead and contribute enthusiastically to positive change in our communities. I will work tirelessly with all levels of government on the important issues.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Nova Scotia election: 2013, Halifax, News", "application-name": "metronews.ca", "baseDomain": "http://www.metronews.ca/", "og": {"url": "http://www.metronews.ca/news/halifax/2013/10/06/having-their-say-meet-the-candidates-in-the-hrm-ridings-for-tuesdays-provincial-election.html", "site_name": "metronews.ca", "image": "http://www.metronews.ca/etc/designs/thestar/images/apple-touch.png", "type": "article", "title": "Having their say: Meet the candidates in HRM ridings for Tuesday's provincial election | Metro News"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.metronews.ca/content/dam/thestar/2013/10/06/10-07-hal4-election-candidates-jh.jpg", "card": "photo", "title": "Having their say: Meet the candidates in HRM ridings for Tuesday's provincial election | Metro News"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "metronews.ca", "msapplication-navbutton-color": "#0066a4", "p": {"domain_verify": "81d199f7387bc50974c9e161d71512bb"}, "msapplication-window": "width=1024;height=768", "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.metronews.ca/news/halifax/2013/10/06/having-their-say-meet-the-candidates-in-the-hrm-ridings-for-tuesdays-provincial-election.html", "storyId": "dc343674-929a-4e6b-80f2-e5f8da010c16", "keywords": "Nova Scotia election: 2013, Halifax, News", "pagetype": "article", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/metrocanada", "section": "News", "modified": "2013-10-06T14:18:26-04:00", "published": "2013-10-06T14:18:26-04:00"}, "thumbnail": "http://www.metronews.ca/content/dam/thestar/2013/10/06/10-07-hal4-election-candidates-jh.jpg.size.xxsmall.promo.jpg", "viewport": "width=1260"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc96bc\"", "article_summary": "*Sid Prest, NDP: It has been a privilege to serve the people of the Eastern Shore as the NDP MLA.\nAs your NDP MLA, I would connect with Bedford residents more regularly and work for their better future.\nColchester-Musquodoboit ValleyTom Martin, Liberal: Life experience would set me aside from the other candidates.\nThe NDP is working on making Nova Scotia stronger, and Dartmouth East deserves an MLA focused on that goal.\nMy community commitment is well known in environmental circles, the business community, and by participating in the many local community events."}
