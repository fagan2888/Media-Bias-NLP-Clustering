She’s kissed a girl and she’s liked it, she’s had some crazy Friday nights, and now pop star Katy Perry wants to sing about Hillary Clinton if she decides to run for president.

Last week, Perry met up with Clinton at a reception before the politician signed some copies of her new book “Hard Choices” at a Los Angeles Barnes & Noble, reports Daily Mail.

The singer captured her big moment next to the former secretary of State by posting a photo to Instagram with the caption, “I told @hillaryclinton that I would write her a ‘theme’ song if she needs it.” The possibilities for the tune are endless; she could combine birthdays with Benghazi, or perhaps sing about a wild party with Bill. The video could even feature Clinton dancing around with aliens.

Perry has never been shy about voicing her political support. She performed at President Obama’s most recent inauguration and refused to allow her parents to accompany her because of their conservative leanings.

She also encouraged her fans to vote for Obama in 2012 by wearing very loud, very tight dresses. Maybe there will be equally tight “Hillary” dresses in her future to compliment Clinton’s “theme song.”
