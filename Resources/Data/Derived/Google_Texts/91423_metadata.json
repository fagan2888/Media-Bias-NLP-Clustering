A National Retail Federation (NRF) commissioned study found that the cost to comply with the proposed FLSA, changes was estimated at $745 million and affect nearly three to five million workers. Regardless of your personal views on the issue, the simple equation for retailers is that the cost of retail labor is going up, substantially.\n\n\n\nThose retailers who rise to the challenge during this period of turmoil, will gain a competitive advantage over their rivals. Retail winners will thrive by embracing their retail workforce as a strategic asset, while minimizing the financial impact of labor law compliance. Retailers can maximize their workforce by following three principals.\n\n\n\nAttract and Retain the Best Retail Workforce\n\nQuite simply tomorrow\u2019s workforce will be significantly different than today\u2019s. As Rainer Strack elaborated on his research in the Ted Talk \u201cThe Workforce Crisis of 2030\u201d the future workforce is focused on culture and specifically on the personal relationship between employer and employee. Those employers who can provide the schedules, tools and interaction that create a positive culture will experience lower turnover and higher employee morale. The good news is technology is already available to help. Mobile applications that allow employees manage their schedules, swap shifts, enter time-off requests and review details such as hours worked, pending schedules and accrued benefits are growing in popularity. Further, advanced tools are providing retailers with prescriptive hiring and scheduling recommendations that allow Retailers to accurately hire and schedule their labor resources all while ensuring compliance with the rapidly evolving legal requirements.\n\n\n\nOptimize Workforce Productivity and Compliance\n\nStore managers cannot be expected to juggle variables, like associate requests and store sales requirements, and still arrive at an optimal schedule that ensures compliance with all legal requirements using only a spreadsheet or basic tools.\n\n\n\nToday\u2019s workforce also wants to feel empowered and productive. Associates want to help customers on their shopping journeys by providing the information and services customers need to complete their path to purchase. They can\u2019t do that if the customer has more information at their fingertips than the associate has. Therefore, associates need visibility to enterprise-wide inventory, knowledge about current and upcoming promotions, and the ability to handle endless aisle and save-the-sale transactions through mobile devices or readily available kiosks. Both for efficiency and to empower the workforce, mobile task management tools must also be provided to support new complicated fulfillment options, like buy online pickup in-store and buy online ship-from-store.\n\n\n\nLeverage Advanced Store Operations Tools\n\nRetailers have gone to great lengths to streamline their supply chains and develop competitive merchandising strategies, however, the store associate has generally received far less investment. In the new, consumer-driven omni-channel marketplace, a well-trained and well-equipped associate is a critical part of the supply chain to drive revenue, provide seamless omni-channel shopping experiences and create loyal customers.\n\n\n\nWorkforce Management and Tasking systems will increasingly be integrated with other retail systems, such as a Distributed Order Management (DOM) solution, Transportation Management Solution (TMS), or even point-of-sale (POS). Using existing and new sources of data store associates and managers can complete prioritized tasks based on store traffic, inbound orders/shipments, sales trends, weather events and many other variables\u2014all while maintaining compliance with work rules and labor legislation.\n\n\n\nWinning at Retail\n\nThe evolving role of the store and the demand for omnichannel shopping experiences is putting greater emphasis on the retail workforce as a driver of retail success. Retailers who elevate their workforces to a strategic level will gain competitive cost and service advantage, while protecting themselves from the growing legal requirements.\n\n\n\n-Tyler Owen, senior director, Global Solutions Strategy, Store Operations, JDA Software\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"expiry Date": "3/25/2066 1:42:50 PM", "description": "Retailers can maximize their workforce by following three principals.", "copyright": "Edgell Communications", "author": "Edgell Communications", "og": {"url": "http://risnews.edgl.com/retail-news/Winning-at-Retail--Maximizing-the-Strategic-Workforce-Amidst-the-Legal-Chaos104915", "image": "http://risnews.edgl.com/CMSPages/GetFile.aspx?guid=456f6b7a-45c7-404d-b734-e024ce90a549", "type": "Article", "description": "Retailers can maximize their workforce by following three principals.", "title": "Winning at Retail: Maximizing the Strategic Workforce Amidst the Legal Chaos"}, "sitename": "RIS News", "keywords": "Distribution, Distribution Center Management, Inventory Control Management, JDA Software Group, Inc., Labor Workforce Mgmt Scheduling, Mobile phones - apps, Mobile Retailing, Mobile workforce management (MWM), Point of Service (POS) Hardware, Point of Service (POS) Software, POS, Transportation Management, Warehouse and Distribution, Workflow Management, Workforce Management", "content type": "Retail News", "viewport": "width=device-width, maximum-scale=1 initial-scale=1 user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "Retail winners will thrive by embracing their retail workforce as a strategic asset, while minimizing the financial impact of labor law compliance.\nWinning at RetailThe evolving role of the store and the demand for omnichannel shopping experiences is putting greater emphasis on the retail workforce as a driver of retail success.\nRegardless of your personal views on the issue, the simple equation for retailers is that the cost of retail labor is going up, substantially.\nWorkforce Management and Tasking systems will increasingly be integrated with other retail systems, such as a Distributed Order Management (DOM) solution, Transportation Management Solution (TMS), or even point-of-sale (POS).\nLeverage Advanced Store Operations ToolsRetailers have gone to great lengths to streamline their supply chains and develop competitive merchandising strategies, however, the store associate has generally received far less investment."}
