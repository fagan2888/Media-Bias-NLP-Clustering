Those 65 and older are covered by Medicare, while those 18 and under qualify for MIChild, a Michigan insurance program for children whose parents lack insurance.\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause of MIChild, 96 percent of Michigan children were insured in 2012. In Kalamazoo County, it was 99 percent.\n\n\n\n\n\nStatewide, 14.4 percent of adults with a job lack insurance; 40 percent of those who are unemployed and seeking work, and 15 percent of adults under age 64 who don't work and aren't seeking work.
