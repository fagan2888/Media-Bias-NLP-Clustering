Of course the best solution for battling the cold weather is to stay indoors as much as possible, but for those that need to be outside they should follow a few guidelines.

Frostbite in these cold of temperatures can hit in as little as five minutes, so people should make to cover as much bare skin as possible, especially the ears, toes and fingers because those are more likely to get frostbite.

You should also wear as many layers of loose-fitting clothing and water-resistant coat and boots.

If you are traveling, make sure to have winter survival kits in your car as well as a full cell phone battery in case you get in an accident.

Vehicles themselves need to be taken care of in the cold as well. Make sure to start your car at least fifteen minutes before driving, and make sure to check the tires because they can lose air in the freezing temperatures.
