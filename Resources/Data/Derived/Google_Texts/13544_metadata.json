The goal was to maneuver the robot into position, then fire Frisbees through a target, competing against three other machines.\n\n\u201cSomething was wrong with the programming,\u2019 said Jaber, a 14-year-old freshman at Forest High School in Ocala. \u201cWe will have to work on recalibrating it.\u201d\n\nThe robot, designed, built and tested in six weeks, was taking part in Robocon Tampa Bay 2013, an event held at the Martinez Center at the University of Tampa which showcases talents of students interested in engineering and programming.\n\nPart of an organization called FIRST Robotics \u2014 For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology \u2014 Robocon was held in the University of Tampa\u2019s gymnasium, which was filled with dozens of students working on their robots or competing in different age groups, ranging from children age 6 to 9 using Legos, to the high school students who made robots that can move, shoot Frisbees and climb.\n\nJaber was one of 85 students at Forest High to work on the project, said Peggy Brookens, director of the school\u2019s engineering magnet program.\n\n\u201cThey had to understand electronics and computer programming and use 3-D cad/cam systems,\u201d said Brookens. \u201cThey had to build, model, draft, make a prototype, test it and redesign it. It is a pretty impressive endeavor.\u201d\n\nTo Ben Weiss, a 16-year-old junior at Dwyer High School in Palm Beach, building his team\u2019s robot, called Vertigo, was all-encompassing.\n\n\u201cWe worked all day, every day,\u201d said Weiss, who led mechanical aspects of the effort.\n\nFor the high school students, Robocon, which continues Sunday, takes place in the international robotics championship \u201coff season.\u201d\n\nWeiss said his team, made up of students from Dwyer High School and Jupiter High School, have competed around the state and even at the world championship which took place in St. Louis in April.\n\n\u201cI want to be some type of engineer when I grow up,\u201d he said.\n\nTerri Willingham, regional director for FIRST Robotics in Central Florida, said in addition to offering the students a chance to build robots and compete, Robocon is a way to show business leaders there is a lot of talent in the area.\n\nTalent, she said, that educators hope business leaders will want to keep here.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of bright kids here,\u201d said Willingham. \u201cThere are $17 million worth of scholarships available to students who take part in this program.\u201d\n\nhaltman@tamaptrib.com\n\n(813) 259-7629", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sat, 26 Oct 2013 18:52:19 -0400", "Description": "Imagine 4 balked at the command, moving backward instead of forward.", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "Imagine 4 balked at the command, moving backward instead of forward.", "title": "Tampa area\u2019s tech-savy kids show talents at Robocon", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/news/breaking-news/all/tampa-areas-tech-savy-kids-show-talents-at-robocon-20131026/", "image": {"width": 3010, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20131026/ARTICLE/131029354/EP/1/2/EP-131029354.jpg", "height": 2202}, "updated_time": "2013-10-26T18:52:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "tbo.com", "description": "Imagine 4 balked at the command, moving backward instead of forward.", "title": "Tampa area\u2019s tech-savy kids show talents at Robocon", "image": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20131026/ARTICLE/131029354/AR/0/AR-131029354.jpg", "site": "@TBOcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2013-10-26T18:52:19Z-04", "modified_time": "2013-10-26T18:52:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfee4\"", "article_summary": "\u201cSomething was wrong with the programming,\u2019 said Jaber, a 14-year-old freshman at Forest High School in Ocala.\nThe goal was to maneuver the robot into position, then fire Frisbees through a target, competing against three other machines.\nIt is a pretty impressive endeavor.\u201dTo Ben Weiss, a 16-year-old junior at Dwyer High School in Palm Beach, building his team\u2019s robot, called Vertigo, was all-encompassing.\nFor the high school students, Robocon, which continues Sunday, takes place in the international robotics championship \u201coff season.\u201dWeiss said his team, made up of students from Dwyer High School and Jupiter High School, have competed around the state and even at the world championship which took place in St. Louis in April.\nJaber was one of 85 students at Forest High to work on the project, said Peggy Brookens, director of the school\u2019s engineering magnet program."}
