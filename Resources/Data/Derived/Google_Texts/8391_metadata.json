O'Rourke, the amicus brief, written to defend against an Ohio law criminalizing inaccurate political speech, was dubbed the \"best ever\" by the legal-minded website \"Above the Law.\"\n\nThe oddball legal document defends lies as \"a key part of political discourse,\" and hammers home the point with an early footnote stating that the filers, \"their counsel, family members, and pets have all won the Congressional Medal of Honor.\"\n\nThe case stems from the complaint of a former Ohio Congressman over a billboard planned by an anti-abortion group that stated he voted for federally funded abortions. Ex-Representative Steven Dreihaus got the billboard company to halt the planned ad, arguing that the claim was false and violated an Ohio statute that made it a crime to make false statements about a candidate. Activist group Susan B. Anthony List said it was making the assertion based on Dreihaus' vote for Obamacare, and challenged Ohio's law in court. Dreihaus says the group's claim is false because Obamacare requires abortions to be funded with non-federal money.\n\nIn fact, the question of whether anyone receives abortions subsidized with federal funds is debatable -- and that's another of the brief filers' points.\n\nThough worth a read no matter what your political stripes, you might have to wear your right-wing goggles to fully appreciate some of the libertarian-leaning humor of the Cato Institute. For example:\n\n\"After all, where would we be without the knowledge that Democrats are pinko-communist flag-burners who want to tax churches and use the money to fund abortions so they can use the fetal stem cells to create pot-smoking lesbian ATF agents who will steal all the guns and invite the UN to take over America?\"\n\nPolitical discourse is weakened if Americans can't express not just truth, but \"truthiness,\" Colbert's term for a statement \"asserted 'from the gut' or because it 'feels right,' without regard to evidence or logic, the brief states.\n\nThe entire brief isn't funny -- after all, as it concludes, \"criminalizing political speech is no laughing matter\" -- but if you're interested in First Amendment issues, be sure to check it out.\n\nClick here to read the amicus brief by the Cato Institute.\n\nGot a tip?
