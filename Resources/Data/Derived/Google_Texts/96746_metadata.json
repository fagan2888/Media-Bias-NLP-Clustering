(Aug. 23, 2015/FOX Carolina)\n\nOn Sunday afternoon, officials responded to the scene of a reported incident on Lake Robinson.\n\nDispatchers with the Greenville County Sheriff's Office said deputies are assisting after subjects reportedly fell from a boat into the water and were struck. The incident occurred near Mays Bridge Road and Groce Meadow Road.\n\nAn official from the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources said the throttle hung up on the tiller handle and a family was thrown from the 14-foot boat.\n\nOfficials said an 8-year-old boy suffered the worst injuries, four to five inch deep gashes from the boat's propeller. A girl between ages 4 and 5 years old suffered injuries to her right heel and their father broke his left arm, they said.\n\nThey said the only reason the boat did not run over the boy and father is because it ran out of gas.\n\nThe three victims were transported to Greenville Memorial Hospital for treatment where officials said the little boy is in stable condition. Lake Cunningham Fire Department assisted EMS officials at the scene and said they believe the boy was alert and responsive when he arrived at the hospital.\n\nDNR said both children were wearing life jackets at the time of the incident.\n\nCopyright 2015 FOX Carolina (Meredith Corporation).
