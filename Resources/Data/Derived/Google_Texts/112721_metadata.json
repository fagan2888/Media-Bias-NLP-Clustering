But in St. Louis, those national ads were supplemented with a different kind of Super Bowl commercial.\n\nOn screen, the camera focused on the face of a white middle class teenager as he died of a heroin overdose. Off screen, a singer crooned along to perky guitar music: First you stole prescription pills from your mom/You threw back a few and then they were gone/So you\u2019re jonesing real bad and you need some more\u2026 And that\u2019s how, how you got addicted to heroin.\n\nRelated: U.S.'s $7B War on Drugs Helped Grow Afghanistan's Heroin Biz\n\nBeginning in the 1920s, when heroin became illegal, people tended to think of heroin abuse as a problem plaguing people of color in the big cities. But in the past decade, heroin abuse has exploded\u2014and it is hitting white people in suburbs and rural areas particularly hard. As the demographics of heroin use have changed, so have states\u2019 efforts to combat the problem.\n\n\u201cPeople have recognized that (heroin addiction) is a problem facing folks they know as well as groups that are distant from them. That certainly affects the way you view the problem,\u201d said Kurt Schmoke, who as Baltimore mayor from 1987 to 1999 was harshly criticized for his efforts to decriminalize drug use.\n\nTwenty-seven states and the District of Columbia now have laws designed to make naloxone, a heroin antidote that is 99 percent effective, more easily accessible to overdose victims, according to the Network for Public Health Law. Since 2007, 21 states and the District adopted so-called \u201cGood Samaritan laws\u201d that provide some type of immunity for people calling 911 to report or seek help for an overdose.\n\nLast year, Vermont Gov. Peter Shumlin, a Democrat, devoted his entire State of the State speech to his state\u2019s heroin crisis. Last month, Republican Gov. Larry Hogan of Maryland declared a \u201cstate of emergency\u201d and pledged to dedicate resources to combat the heroin scourge in his state. And last week Democratic Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe introduced six heroin-related bills.\n\nRelated: 'Zombies on Drugs' Cost Taxpayers Nearly $300K\n\n\u201cIn some states, now that budgets are generally looking better, states are looking at this as a different problem than in the previous decade,\u201d said Karmen Hanson, program manager for the National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL). \u201cIt\u2019s not just an urban problem; it\u2019s a rural problem. It\u2019s not just under the viaduct in the big cities. It\u2019s also a suburban problem. It\u2019s widespread culturally and ethnographically.\u201d\n\nExplosive and Widespread Growth\n\nBetween 2006 and 2013, the number of first time heroin users nearly doubled, from 90,000 to 169,000, according to the U.S. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration(SAMHSA). Ninety percent of the people who tried the drug for the first time in the past decade are white, compared to an equal number of white and nonwhite users who got their start before the 1980s, according to a study published last year in JAMA Psychiatry.\n\n\u201cHeroin use has changed from an inner-city, minority-centered problem to one that has a more widespread geographical distribution, involving primarily white men and women in their late 20s living outside of large urban areas,\u201d researchers concluded. Perhaps not coincidentally, the past two years have seen a remarkable uptick in \u201charm reduction\u201d laws that focus on saving lives, rather than incarcerating users.\n\n\u201cWith the changing demographics, there is the ability to frame this as a public health issue because many policy makers and law enforcement folks seem to relate to white users who are experiencing heroin use disorders more than people of color,\u201d said Kathie Kane-Willis, director of the Illinois Consortium on Drug Policy at Roosevelt University. Kane-Willis is a former heroin user who was introduced to the drug as a college student at Sarah Lawrence College in the late 1980s.\n\nRelated: Budding Pot Industry Has Trouble Stashing Its Cash\n\nTed Cicero, a psychiatry professor at Washington University Medical School and a coauthor of the JAMA study, agreed that \u201cwhen heroin became a white problem of middle-class kids,\u201d that got lawmakers\u2019 attention. \u201cNow that it\u2019s hit home (for some legislators), it\u2019s become a major, major issue. No question the epidemic is growing. The demand is growing for it. And as long as there is that demand, the need will be met.\u201d\n\nThe shifting attitude fits a historical pattern, according to Marc Mauer, executive director of The Sentencing Project, a nonprofit that promotes sentencing reforms. In the 1930s, he said, the popular perception of marijuana was that it was \u201cused in the racy part of town, in jazz clubs. The public perception was the users were Mexicans and African-Americans.\u201d As a result, Mauer said, marijuana was viewed as \u201cthe demon drug\u201d and penalties for its use were harsh.\n\nBut by the 1960s, white middle-class youth had started smoking pot and perceptions changed. Several decades later, Washington state and Colorado have legalized recreational marijuana use and other states are poised to follow suit.\n\nPain-Killer Roots\n\nThe 21st century heroin epidemic has its roots in the crackdown on the abuse of OxyContin, Vicodin and other opioid pain medications. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, nearly 80 percent of heroin users say that they previously abused prescription opioids. When, for example, the formula for OxyContin was tweaked to make it more difficult to grind up to snort or inject, many abusers switched to heroin.\n\nRelated: Why That Painkiller Will Be a Lot Harder to Get\n\nThe shuttering of so-called \u201cpill mills\u201d also contributed to the scarcity of prescription opiates.\n\nMeanwhile, drug traffickers peddling heroin slashed their prices to undercut the rising prices of prescription opiates\u2014and a new market was created. Heroin supplies increased exponentially as well. Between 2007 and 2013, seizures of the drug increased 289 percent, according to the Office of National Drug Control Policy.\n\n\u201cThe face of heroin changed with the rise and use of prescription drugs,\u201d said Barbara Cimaglio, the deputy commissioner of Alcohol and Drug Abuse Programs with the Vermont Department of Health. \u201cWe found more people getting into trouble because they had an injury or some medical condition that got them involved with prescription opiates. Then when a lot of those folks were no longer able to get those prescription opiates, it was heroin because it was cheaper and easier to get.\u201d\n\nAmong those who started using heroin in the 1960s, more than 80 percent reported that heroin was the first drug that they had ever used. Of those who began using heroin in the 2000s, 75 percent reported that their first drug use began with prescription opiates. Beginning in 2010, as heroin use increased across the country, prescription opioid use decreased, Cicero of Washington University said.\n\nA New Battle Plan\n\nTo address Vermont\u2019s runaway heroin problem\u2014the state saw a 250 percent increase in people seeking treatment for heroin addiction between 2000 and 2014\u2014lawmakers set up a pretrial services system, Cimaglio said. The system allows people arrested on drug charges to get screened for substance abuse and gives them the option of going to treatment rather than being charged with a crime and entering the criminal justice system.\n\nRelated: U.S. Wasted $76B to Stop Afghan Heroin Production\n\nThis usually works when officials are able to determine that the arrestee\u2019s criminal activity was related to addiction and that they are not a drug dealer or trafficker, Cimaglio said. \u201cPeople are much more aware that addiction is a health problem. Because of the illegality of certain substances, people are driven to commit acts they wouldn\u2019t have to commit to get alcohol,\u201d Cimaglio said.\n\nAs Baltimore mayor, Schmoke faced considerable criticism for turning the war on drugs into a public health issue. For his efforts to implement a needle exchange program to reduce the spread of HIV/AIDS, he was dubbed \u201cthe most dangerous man in America\u201d by U.S. Rep. Charles Rangel, a Democrat.\n\nNow, Schmoke said, he watches with bemusement today\u2019s legislative efforts to combat heroin addiction.\n\n\u201cI obviously wish that elected officials had embraced the idea of a public health war on drugs rather than criminal justice war on drugs,\u201d said Schmoke, now president of the University of Baltimore. \u201cIt would have allowed us to reduce our incarcerated population; it would have left people without criminal records that now complicate their ability to get employment and lead stable lives.\u201d\n\n\u201c(But) that\u2019s in the past now. We can only look to the future and focus more on the public health aspects of this rather than the criminal justice aspect.\u201d\n\nThis article originally appeared in Stateline, a nonpartisan, nonprofit news service of the Pew Center on the States that provides daily reporting and analysis on trends in state policy.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "On Super Bowl Sunday, most football fans watched ads for Victoria\u2019s Secret, the lost B", "title": "You\u2019ll Never Believe Who\u2019s Abusing Heroin Most", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/04/You-ll-Never-Believe-Who-s-Abusing-Heroin-Most", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/02042015_Heroin.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/04/You-ll-Never-Believe-Who-s-Abusing-Heroin-Most", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/02042015_Heroin.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "On Super Bowl Sunday, most football fans watched ads for Victoria\u2019s Secret, the lost B", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe16a0\"", "article_summary": "Peter Shumlin, a Democrat, devoted his entire State of the State speech to his state\u2019s heroin crisis.\nAs Baltimore mayor, Schmoke faced considerable criticism for turning the war on drugs into a public health issue.\n\u201cPeople are much more aware that addiction is a health problem.\nBut in the past decade, heroin abuse has exploded\u2014and it is hitting white people in suburbs and rural areas particularly hard.\n\u201cPeople have recognized that (heroin addiction) is a problem facing folks they know as well as groups that are distant from them."}
