Republicans and Democrats say the new plan could be a model for Texas.\n\nVoters in the Rio Grande Valley community narrowly rejected the formation of a hospital district last year. Tea party and taxpayer groups blasted the plan as overpriced and overly bureaucratic.\n\nThe defeat spawned a revamped and more fiscally conservative program, with maximum costs capped at less than a third of the initial proposal.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tea party concept \u2014 lower spending and more (financial) protections,\u201d said Jennifer Saenz, spokeswoman for state Sen. Juan Hinojosa, D-McAllen, who sponsored the enabling legislation.\n\nInstead of capping costs at 75 cents per $100 of assessed property value \u2014 as allowed by most counties \u2014 the Hidalgo district would max out at 25 cents, roughly the state average.\n\nSaenz estimates that initial costs at 7 or 8 cents. Those funds would be eligible for federal matching money by running the program through the new University of Texas-Rio Grande Valley Medical School. Whatever taxes the district collects for indigent care would require commensurate reductions in the county\u2019s general fund.\n\nFurther, any increases in health-care district spending exceeding 8 percent must be approved by local voters, Saenz said. Unlike many other Texas counties, Hidalgo\u2019s program would be subject to the homestead exemption.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be looked at as a model,\u201d Saenz told Watchdog.org in an interview.\n\nVoters first must approve the district, however. Not all tea partyers are sold on the idea.\n\n\u201cThe only part I believe is that they will \u2018create thousands of new jobs.\u2019 That is actually the worst part,\u201d said Terry Frady, an activist with the Brownsville Tea Party.\n\n\u201cThey will put private business out of business, then the taxpayers will be the ones paying for thousands of employees and their benefits,\u201d she said.\n\nThough Hinojosa\u2019s bill received broad bipartisan support at the Legislature, Frady contends the veteran lawmaker is compromised by political contributions from health-care organizations, which could benefit from Hidalgo\u2019s program. For example, Hinojosa has received some $626,000 from the Border Health PAC.\n\nWhile a referendum date has not been set by Hidalgo County \u2014 voter petitions must still be gathered \u2014 and operational details remain sketchy, the Texas Public Policy Foundation points to Bexar County\u2019s CareLink program as a possible template.\n\nRun by San Antonio\u2019s University Health System, CareLink has earned national recognition as an effective and accountable safety net for lower-income residents not eligible for Medicaid but too poor to buy private health insurance.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of the best ones in the state,\u201d said John Davidson, director of the Center for Health Care Policy at the market-minded think tank in Austin.\n\n\u201c(CareLink) requires (patients) to make monthly payments based on a sliding income scale. If not, they\u2019re kicked out and have to reapply,\u201d Davidson told Watchdog.org.\n\n\u201cAs a result, CareLink is not viewed as an entitlement but as a benefit that people have a stake in. There\u2019s a sense of ownership, even at a deeply discounted rate.\u201d\n\nDon Finley, spokesman for UHS, says CareLink is \u201cintended to keep members healthy and out of the hospital, and from seeking routine care in the emergency department where it is the most costly.\u201d\n\nEven under the Affordable Care Act, more than 3 million Texans aren\u2019t covered by Medicaid or private insurance.\n\nWhichever way Hidalgo goes, Hinojosa says the county\u2019s current indigent-care system is unsustainable.\n\n\u201cOur healthcare providers provide millions of dollars in care to people who can\u2019t afford it every year, forcing them to pass the bill onto county taxpayers or to people with insurance through higher fees and premiums,\u201d Hinojosa said in a statement.\n\nKenric Ward writes for Texas Watchdog.org.
