But they are still mulling taxes as pot is produced, such as how the land on which marijuana is grown should be assessed for property taxes.\n\nSome lawmakers in both states say marijuana growers shouldn\u2019t be eligible for any taxation perks afforded to farmers that grow conventional crops. Others say that marijuana while it\u2019s growing should be treated like the hops and barley that go on to become highly taxed alcohol.\n\nColorado lawmakers delayed a vote last week on whether marijuana greenhouses should be considered agricultural or commercial property. The bill, meant to codify the already-common practice of assessing conventional nurseries and greenhouses, ran into confusion when its sponsor added a last-minute amendment to ban pot growers from getting the advantage.\n\nRepublican Sen. Kevin Grantham said he wanted pot growers to \u201cnot see any benefit from the ag designation.\u201d\n\nGrantham opposed marijuana legalization in 2012, but said his latest effort to block marijuana tax breaks isn\u2019t a knock on the growers. Instead, he says, he simply wanted to keep the focus of his bill on traditional crops and avoid a marijuana debate.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the fight we\u2019re fighting right now,\u201d Grantham said before his bill was first heard. Later the same day, while explaining his bill to colleagues, Grantham joked that his effort backfired, and that the pot language was \u201cquickly growing to be the fun part of this bill now, apparently.\u201d\n\nWashington lawmakers, meanwhile, are considering a bill to prohibit marijuana growers from qualifying for agriculture tax breaks for 10 years\u2014giving the state time to collect information and make a decision.\n\nThe states flouting federal drug law and establishing commercial pot industries have settled how to tax marijuana once it\u2019s dried and ready to smoke. But how to tax growing marijuana and the land it\u2019s grown on is still under debate.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re too early in the process to make a determination how to do this right,\u201d said Meg Sanders, owner of Gaia Plant-Based Medicine in Denver.\n\nSanders owns a three-store chain of medical marijuana dispensaries and a 35,000-square-foot warehouse in Denver where her marijuana is grown. Denver considers marijuana growing sites commercial property, while a warehouse growing commercial tomatoes or lettuce is considered \u201cother agriculture.\u201d\n\nThe difference for tax purposes is significant, though rates vary by county.\n\n\u201cI believe that retail marijuana should be treated as any other agricultural crop in a state where it is legal. It is a plant, just like any other plant grown for consumption,\u201d Sanders said.\n\nColorado voters last year overwhelmingly approved steep taxes on finished marijuana, which is taxed at least 25 percent, in addition to local taxes. But Colorado law is still murky on how growing marijuana should be taxed.\n\nGrantham believes marijuana producers should enjoy none of the property tax perks afforded to conventional farmers. Others point out that alcohol is highly taxed, but the hops and barley raised to make it qualify for agriculture tax rates.\n\n\u201cWhy should this be any different?\u201d asked Sen. Jessie Ulibarri, D-Westminster. Ulibarri\u2019s district includes many marijuana warehouses located along Interstate 70 just north of Denver.\n\nGrantham\u2019s bill awaits a vote in the Senate Finance Committee. The agriculture assessment change wouldn\u2019t cost the state any money, and almost all local assessors already use the agricultural property tax category for conventional greenhouses and nurseries. Any differing tax collections would be felt at the county level, with no estimates available. Current Colorado law says that medical marijuana growers are eligible for no agricultural tax breaks, but the law is silent on how recreational pot land should be taxed.\n\nIn Washington, lawmakers have yet to vote on a bill prohibiting marijuana growers from qualifying for agriculture tax breaks.\n\nWashington officials estimate that the industry could currently qualify for three dozen different tax breaks, largely surrounding agricultural production. But a state House committee is exploring a bill that would block those tax breaks for 10 years.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Reuven Carlyle, a sponsor of the bill, said he doesn\u2019t think the tax preferences were designed to help the marijuana industry, which is currently under development.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know that we have a problem in the marketplace that these exemptions would be designed to fix,\u201d said Carlyle, who represents portions of Seattle.\n\nWashington officials estimate that the new rules would increase state and local tax revenues by a combined $3.5 million over the span of one year.\n\nWashington lawmakers have not scheduled any votes on the bill.\n\nBoth states voted in 2012 to legalize and regulate the recreational use of pot by adults over 21, with retail marijuana shops allowed. Sales began Jan. 1 in Colorado and are due to begin in Washington in the coming months.\n\nMarijuana in Washington will be taxed 25 percent at three possible transfer points from production to retail sale, plus sales taxes. Colorado voters approved a 25 percent sales and excise tax on finished marijuana, plus local taxes.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAssociated Press writer Mike Baker in Seattle contributed to this report.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nKristen Wyatt can be reached at http://www.twitter.com/APkristenwyatt", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Colorado marijuana farmers unlikely to see farm tax perks", "title": "Colorado marijuana farmers unlikely to see farm tax perks", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/02/09/colorado-marijuana-farmers-unlikely-to-see-farm-tax-perks/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140204__123113_MARIJUANA_906xp1-3.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140204__123113_MARIJUANA_906xp1-3.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-09T11:14:21+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T23:21:24+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddf14\"", "article_summary": "But how to tax growing marijuana and the land it\u2019s grown on is still under debate.\nSome lawmakers in both states say marijuana growers shouldn\u2019t be eligible for any taxation perks afforded to farmers that grow conventional crops.\nIn Washington, lawmakers have yet to vote on a bill prohibiting marijuana growers from qualifying for agriculture tax breaks.\nBut Colorado law is still murky on how growing marijuana should be taxed.\nMarijuana farmers and agricultural tax breaks are the next wrinkle facing the states that have legal weed as lawmakers debate how to tax the product while it\u2019s growing."}
