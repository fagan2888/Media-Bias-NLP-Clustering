There is little doubt that the past few years of partisan warfare and legislative gridlock have been bad for the city\u2019s high-priced lobbying firms, after a banner decade of growth and jaw-dropping profits.\n\nRelated: Voters Give a Thumbs-Down to Their Own Lawmakers\n\nThe 113th Congress passed fewer substantive bills last year than any other Congress in two decades -- just 55 laws compared with 63 in 2011, the first year of the 112th Congress, which itself was one of the least productive in recent history, according to an analysis by the Pew Research Center.\n\nLast year, for the third year in a row, Washington\u2019s top, gold-plated lobbying organizations saw a decline in revenue. The city\u2019s 10 largest firms reported a collective 1 percent decline in lobbying revenues compared to 2012 revenues \u2013 a drop from $228.9 to $226.3 million, according to the Washington Post.\n\nThe biggest declines came from Patton Boggs, a lobbying powerhouse, which saw revenues decline 13 percent, to $40.2 million, from the previous year; the Podesta Group, down less than 1 percent to $27.3 million; Brownstein Hyatt, down 2 percent to $22.2 million; Van Scoyoc Associates, down 5 percent to $21.4 million, and K&L Gates, down 5 percent to $16.3 million.\n\nWhile the latest revenue decline was far less than the 10 percent collective drop reported a year ago, \u201cit indicates that Congress\u2019s lack of productivity in 2013 continues to be a drag on an industry whose business is so closely tied to government action,\u201d the Post noted.\n\nIndustry-wide, the impact of a dysfunctional and highly unproductive Congress has been far more dramatic and damaging to the city\u2019s lobbying fraternity. Overall spending on lobbying in Washington totaled $2.38 billion last year \u2013 down $1.17 billion from the record high of $3.55 billion in 2010, according to figures compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics, a watchdog group. During that same period, firms were forced repeatedly to lay off employees. The number of registered lobbyists shrank from 12,966 to 11,935 during that period.\n\nRelated: Lobbying Groups Ramp Up War on Obamacare\n\nNot surprisingly, the lion\u2019s share of the billions on lobbying was spent to influence health care and financial services legislation amid raging controversies over the Affordable Care Act and the Dodd-Frank banking and financial services reforms.\n\nThe Hill reports that K Street lobbyists are racking up frequent flyer miles with regular trips to Silicon Valley in search of clients. \u201cThey are trading power suits for California casual to cash in on the explosive growth of technology lobbying, which has more than doubled over the past decade and shows no signs of slowing down,\u201d the newspaper said.\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) doesn\u2019t apologize for Congress\u2019s dismal legislative record. In fact, he boasts about it. Late last fall he told reporters he was proud of putting a brake on tougher regulations on business and efforts by President Obama to push a more liberal agenda on the country.\n\n\u201cListen,\u201d Boehner said, \u201cwe have a very divided country and we have a very divided government. And I\u2019m not going to sit here and underestimate the difficulty in finding the common ground, because there\u2019s not as much common ground here as there used to be.\u201d\n\nHe might as well have taken a bow for slowing the growth of special interest spending that has permeated every facet of government today.\n\nTop Reads from the Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "One of the rarely spoken byproducts of the do-nothing Congress has been a decline in special interest spending on lobbying and influence peddling.", "title": "Lobbyists Take a Financial Hit With Do-Nothing Congress", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/01/26/Lobbyists-Take-Financial-Hit-Do-Nothing-Congress", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/08152012_donothing_congress2_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/01/26/Lobbyists-Take-Financial-Hit-Do-Nothing-Congress", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/08152012_donothing_congress2_article.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@ericpianin"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "One of the rarely spoken byproducts of the do-nothing Congress has been a decline in special interest spending on lobbying and influence peddling.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf294\"", "article_summary": "One of the rarely spoken byproducts of the do-nothing Congress has been a decline in special interest spending on lobbying and influence peddling.\nIndustry-wide, the impact of a dysfunctional and highly unproductive Congress has been far more dramatic and damaging to the city\u2019s lobbying fraternity.\nLast year, for the third year in a row, Washington\u2019s top, gold-plated lobbying organizations saw a decline in revenue.\nThe Hill reports that K Street lobbyists are racking up frequent flyer miles with regular trips to Silicon Valley in search of clients.\nThe city\u2019s 10 largest firms reported a collective 1 percent decline in lobbying revenues compared to 2012 revenues \u2013 a drop from $228.9 to $226.3 million, according to the Washington Post."}
