These are scammers dialing for dollars, pretending to be from the IRS to steal your money.\n\nIt is an issue the \u2018Call Christina\u2019 team has been hard at work warning you about over the past year. It is also a problem many Local 10 viewers have \u2018Called Christina\u2019 to report.\n\nRelated Links:\n\nCALLING A SUSPECTED IRS IMPOSTER\n\nJust last week a viewer said someone left a voicemail claiming to be from the IRS.\n\nWhen Investigative Reporter Christina Vazquez called the number back, a man identified himself as \u201cWilliam Black\u201d from the \u201cInternal Revenue Service\u201d.\n\nAfter Christina identified herself and told him she was recording the call she asked a question at which point the man said, \u201cmm-hm, alright, nice listening to your sweet voice, bye,\u201d and hung up.\n\nLast week the New York-based number 646-368-8608 had been red-flagged by the White Pages with 11 spam reports in the last 90 days. By Thursday, it had been flagged as \u201cextortion\u201d labeled a \u201cscam or fraud\u201d.\n\nA MAJOR THREAT: PHONE TAX SCAMS AND 'SPOOFING'\n\nAccording to the Internal Revenue Service, scammers make unsolicited phone calls to taxpayers pretending to be IRS officials. They harass them by threatening victims into paying through prepaid debit card or wire transfers, telling them failing to do so will result in an arrest, deportation or even the revoking of a license.\n\nWith the increasing use of technology, scammers are able to alter caller ID numbers to make it look like a legitimate IRS phone call. It is a trick called \u201cspoofing\u201d. They even go to the extreme of using fake badge numbers of IRS agents. They tend to target those who are most vulnerable including, the elderly, newly arrived immigrants and those whose first language is not English.\n\nThey try to scare you by leaving \u201curgent\u201d callback requests and demanding payment while they have you caught off guard. This scam remains at the top of the \u201cDirty Dozen\u201d list with over 3,000 victims who collectively have paid over 14 million to con artists according to the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration.\n\nThese calls remain a major threat to taxpayers and as we enter the 2016 filing period, keep a few things in mind:\n\n\n\n\u2022 The IRS will never call to demand an immediate payment without first mailing you a bill.\n\n\u2022 The IRS will never require a specific payment method for your taxes\n\n\u2022 The IRS will never threaten to bring in local police or any law-enforcement officials to arrest you for not paying.\n\nIf you get a phone call from someone claiming to be from the IRS and asking for money, here\u2019s what you should do:\n\nIf you don't owe taxes or have no reason to think that you do:\n\n\u2022 Do not give out any information. Hang up immediately.\n\n\u2022 Contact TIGTA to report the call. Use their \u201cIRS Impersonation Scam Reporting\u201d web page. You can also call 800-366-4484.\n\n\u2022 Report it to the Federal Trade Commission. Use the \u201cFTC Complaint Assistant\u201d on FTC.gov. Please add \"IRS Telephone Scam\" in the notes.\n\nIf you know you owe, or think you may owe tax:\n\n\u2022 Call the IRS at 800-829-1040. IRS workers can help you.\n\nStay alert to scams that use the IRS as a lure. Tax scams can happen any time of year, not just at tax time.

These emails and websites can infect your computer with malware and give criminals access to sensitive information such as passwords, social security numbers and identity.\n\nAnother scam often associated with tax season is identity theft. Criminals file fraudulent returns using someone else\u2019s Social Security number. \u201cKeep your personal information safe and secure. Taxpayers should protect their computers and only give out their Social Security when absolutely necessary\u201d says IRS Commissioner John Koskinen.\n\nTAX PREPARERS\n\n\n\n\"Choose your tax return preparer carefully because you entrust them with your private financial information that needs to be protected,\" said IRS Commissioner John Koskinen. \"Most preparers provide high-quality service but we run across cases each year where unscrupulous preparers steal from their clients and misfile their taxes.\"\n\n\n\nReturn preparers are a vital part of the U.S. tax system. About 60 percent of taxpayers use tax professionals to prepare their returns.\n\n\n\nIllegal scams can lead to significant penalties and interest and possible criminal prosecution. IRS Criminal Investigation works closely with the Department of Justice (DOJ) to shutdown scams and prosecute the criminals behind them.\n\n\n\nChoosing Return Preparers Carefully\n\n\n\nIt is important to choose carefully when hiring an individual or firm to prepare your return. Well-intentioned taxpayers can be misled by preparers who don\u2019t understand taxes or who mislead people into taking credits or deductions they aren\u2019t entitled to in order to increase their fee. Every year, these types of tax preparers face everything from penalties to even jail time for defrauding their clients.\n\n\n\nHere are a few tips when choosing a tax preparer:\n\n\n\n\u2022 Ask if the preparer has an IRS Preparer Tax Identification Number (PTIN). Paid tax return preparers are required to register with the IRS, have a PTIN and include it on your tax return.\n\n\n\n\u2022 Inquire whether the tax return preparer has a professional credential (enrolled agent, certified public accountant, or attorney), belongs to a professional organization or attends continuing education classes.\n\nA number of tax law changes, including the Affordable Care Act provisions, can be complex. A competent tax professional needs to be up-to-date in these matters. Tax return preparers aren\u2019t required to have a professional credential, but make sure you understand the qualifications of the preparer you select. IRS.gov has more information regarding the national tax professional organizations.\n\n\n\n\u2022 Check the preparer\u2019s qualifications. Use the IRS Directory of Federal Tax Return Preparers with Credentials and Select Qualifications. This tool can help you find a tax return preparer with the qualifications that you prefer. The Directory is a searchable and sortable listing of certain preparers registered with the IRS. It includes the name, city, state and zip code of:\n\n\n\no Attorneys\n\no CPAs\n\no Enrolled Agents\n\no Enrolled Retirement Plan Agents\n\no Enrolled Actuaries\n\no Annual Filing Season Program participants\n\n\n\n\u2022 Check the preparer\u2019s history. Ask the Better Business Bureau about the preparer. Check for disciplinary actions and the license status for credentialed preparers. For CPAs, check with the State Board of Accountancy. For attorneys, check with the State Bar Association. For Enrolled Agents, go to IRS.gov and search for \u201cverify enrolled agent status\u201d or check the Directory.\n\n\u2022 Ask about service fees. Avoid preparers who base fees on a percentage of their client\u2019s refund. Also avoid those who boast bigger refunds than their competition. Make sure that your refund goes directly to you \u2013 not into your preparer\u2019s bank account.\n\n\u2022 Ask to e-file your return. Make sure your preparer offers IRS e-file. Paid preparers who do taxes for more than 10 clients generally must file electronically. The IRS has processed more than 1.5 billion e-filed tax returns. It\u2019s the safest and most accurate way to file a return.\n\n\u2022 Provide records and receipts. Good preparers will ask to see your records and receipts. They\u2019ll ask questions to determine your total income, deductions, tax credits and other items. Do not rely on a preparer who is willing to e-file your return using your last pay stub instead of your Form W-2. This is against IRS e-file rules.\n\n\u2022 Make sure the preparer is available. In the event questions come up about your tax return, you may need to contact your preparer after the return is filed. Avoid fly-by-night preparers.\n\n\u2022 Understand who can represent you. Attorneys, CPAs, and enrolled agents can represent any client before the IRS in any situation. Non-credentialed tax return preparers who participate in the IRS Annual Filing Season Program, can represent clients in limited situations. However, other tax return preparers cannot represent clients before the IRS on any returns prepared and filed after Dec. 31, 2015.\n\n\u2022 Never sign a blank return. Don\u2019t use a tax preparer that asks you to sign an incomplete or blank tax form.\n\n\u2022 Review your return before signing. Before you sign your tax return, review it and ask questions if something is not clear. Make sure you\u2019re comfortable with the accuracy of the return before you sign it.\n\n\u2022 Report abusive tax preparers to the IRS. You can report abusive tax return preparers and suspected tax fraud to the IRS. Use Form 14157, Complaint: Tax Return Preparer. If you suspect a return preparer filed or changed the return without your consent, you should also file Form 14157-A, Return Preparer Fraud or Misconduct Affidavit. You can get these forms on IRS.gov.\n\n\n\nTo find other tips about choosing a preparer, better understand the differences in credentials and qualifications, research the IRS preparer directory, and learn how to submit a complaint regarding a tax return preparer, visit www.irs.gov/chooseataxpro.\n\n\n\nReminder: Taxpayers are legally responsible for what is on their tax return even if it is prepared by someone else. Make sure the preparer you hire is up to the task.\n\nCopyright 2016 by WPLG Local10.com - All rights reserved.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://sharedmedia.grahamdigital.com/photo/2016/02/04/Tax-forms--taxes--money_2060445_ver1.0_160_90.jpg", "sailthru.author": "Christina Vazquez", "description": "There has been a surge of calls from IRS imposters.
