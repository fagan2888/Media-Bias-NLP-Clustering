Now, with renovations nearing completion, the Tenderloin Neighborhood Development Corporation is accepting rental applications for its 105 affordable units.\n\nThe building is made up of small studios, large studios, and one-bedrooms, with full kitchens and private bathrooms. Rent for studios, which accommodate up to two people, will range from $615 to $1026; residents must have a minimum annual income of $14,760 and a maximum income of $35,700. One-bedroom apartments, which house up to three occupants each, will rent for $659 to $1099; annual income requirements are a minimum or $15,816 and a maximum of $40,750.\n\nRent prices are a couple hundred dollars higher than they were in 2011, Brandon Flannery, the TNDC's compliance manager and section 504 coordinator, told residents at the Tenderloin Futures Collaborative meeting earlier this week. However, the income limits follow the Area Median Index percentage limits set by the Mayor's Office, which are lower than the state's.\n\nA newly renovated kitchen in the Franciscan Towers.

A public lottery will be held July 14, and residents will begin moving in during the last week of July, says Flannery. The building should be fully leased by the end of August, when the TNDC offices and the Tenderloin After-School Program move back into the ground floor.\n\nFlannery said that the TNDC expects to receive about 3,000 applications, with preference given to previous Franciscan Towers residents displaced by the fire, Ellis Act evictees, and individuals and families in the Human Services Agency's Shelter Plus Care program.\n\nMore information on the application and selection process is available here. TNDC is also holding an information session for prospective Franciscan Towers residents on Thursday, June 25th at 220 Golden Gate Ave; it starts at 6:30pm.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://assets.hoodline.com/assets/favicon/browserconfig-80c1823db2ad79011177211337cf8e5648470f95db18762e49d7af6e1c9dee6d.xml", "hoodline": {"neighborhood": "Tenderloin", "env": "production"}, "description": "Four years after a fire displaced 124 residents, the Towers are finally ready to reopen.", "title": "Franciscan Towers Now Accepting Affordable Housing Applications For Summer Reopening | Hoodline", "og": {"site_name": "Hoodline", "description": "Four years after a fire displaced 124 residents, the Towers are finally ready to reopen.", "title": "Franciscan Towers Now Accepting Affordable Housing Applications For Summer Reopening | Hoodline", "url": "http://hoodline.com/2015/06/franciscan-towers-now-accepting-affordable-housing-applications-for-summer-reopening", "image": "https://hoodwork-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/story/image/9977/Franciscan_Towers_Renovation_cmp.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Four years after a fire displaced 124 residents, the Towers are finally ready to reopen.", "title": "Franciscan Towers Now Accepting Affordable Housing Applications For Summer Reopening | Hoodline", "url": "http://hoodline.com/2015/06/franciscan-towers-now-accepting-affordable-housing-applications-for-summer-reopening", "image": {"src": "https://hoodwork-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/story/image/9977/Franciscan_Towers_Renovation_cmp.jpg"}, "creator": "@britthopkins", "site": "@hoodlineSF", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=814699998", "fb": {"app_id": 119795374731913}, "theme-color": "#ff3300", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://assets.hoodline.com/assets/favicon/mstile-144x144-a5d9ac240ecb5f088945b937339a44644ed7f26cc3189fd073689198b1e500cf.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "csrf-token": "bygGDscp5yMKdJJk4ZGxD6wMB21CYpA1n5FN6jfe3H7KD17tQrCK7Ml1CL2aNDg5DjLfZ750bSLwUo+0xHIBdQ=="}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb213\"", "article_summary": "By summer's end, the Franciscan Towers \u2014 the six-story affordable housing complex at the corner of Eddy and Taylor streets \u2014 will be abuzz with residents once again.\nTNDC is also holding an information session for prospective Franciscan Towers residents on Thursday, June 25th at 220 Golden Gate Ave; it starts at 6:30pm.\nA newly renovated kitchen in the Franciscan Towers.\nNow, with renovations nearing completion, the Tenderloin Neighborhood Development Corporation is accepting rental applications for its 105 affordable units.\nFlannery said that the TNDC expects to receive about 3,000 applications, with preference given to previous Franciscan Towers residents displaced by the fire, Ellis Act evictees, and individuals and families in the Human Services Agency's Shelter Plus Care program."}
