According to Politico, the man quoted several verses of scripture that support environmental conservation and ending wars abroad. In response, Christie said that faith and politics should generally be kept separate.\n\n\u201cWe should all acquit ourselves in a way that we believe is consistent with the teachings that we follow, if we follow certain teachings from a religious perspective,\u201d Christie said. \u201cMe for instance, I\u2019m a Catholic, but I\u2019ve used birth control, and not just the rhythm method, okay. So, you know, my church has a teaching against birth control. Does that make me an awful Catholic because I believed and practiced that function during part of my life? I don\u2019t think so.\u201d\n\nThe frank admission from Christie is in line with his fellow Catholics around the world, as religious people\u2019s attitudes toward reproductive health continue to shift.\n\nThe only contraception method sanctioned by the Catholic Church is natural family planning (NFP) \u2014 a method of non-hormonal birth control that involves tracking a woman\u2019s fertility through biological markers like taking her temperature, examining her cervical mucus, or counting the days between her menstrual cycle. NFP has about a 24 percent failure rate and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists does not recommend it for women who could be placed in medical danger by a pregnancy.\n\nNFP isn\u2019t very popular among the faithful. Only 2 percent of U.S. Catholic women of childbearing age actually use this method, according to the Guttmacher Institute. Meanwhile, according to a 2014 poll by Univision, 79 percent of Catholics around the world support the use of other forms of contraception. Previous polling has reported that 82 percent of American Catholics say birth control is \u201cmorally acceptable,\u201d and 98 percent of U.S. Catholic women of childbearing age have used contraception at some point while they\u2019ve been sexually active.\n\nThe widening gulf between the Catholic hierarchy and the Catholic laypeople is becoming especially pronounced in the ongoing controversy over Obamacare\u2019s contraceptive mandate, which Catholic-affiliated groups have fought bitterly against for the past several years.\n\nIn fact, Christie\u2019s stance on birth control is similar to the position of House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D), who is also Catholic. During political debates over Obamacare\u2019s birth control coverage requirements, Pelosi defended the health law, emphasizing that the Catholic Church\u2019s teaching on birth control \u201cisn\u2019t even accepted by the laity churchgoing people themselves.\u201d At the time, right-wing outlets suggested that Pelosi was a bad Catholic, often putting her religious affiliation in scare quotes.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Including Chris Christie.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "Including Chris Christie.", "title": "Birth Control Goes Against Catholicism\u2019s Teachings, But Most Catholics Use It Anyway", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/politics/2015/08/04/3687844/chris-christie-birth-control/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/04125906/AP_340568925941.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Including Chris Christie.", "creator": "@Tara_CR", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/04125906/AP_340568925941-321x214.jpg", "title": "Birth Control Goes Against Catholicism\u2019s Teachings, But Most Catholics Use It Anyway", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-politics", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/04125906/AP_340568925941.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/04125906/AP_340568925941.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-04T13:46:04+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/tculpressler"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcce1a\"", "article_summary": "Politics Birth Control Goes Against Catholicism\u2019s Teachings, But Most Catholics Use It Anyway CREDIT: AP Photo/Charlie NeibergallGOP presidential candidate Chris Christie revealed himself to be among the large majority of Catholics who use birth control, despite the fact that the Catholic hierarchy officially opposes artificial contraception, at a New Hampshire town hall meeting on Tuesday.\nSo, you know, my church has a teaching against birth control.\nIn fact, Christie\u2019s stance on birth control is similar to the position of House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D), who is also Catholic.\n\u201cMe for instance, I\u2019m a Catholic, but I\u2019ve used birth control, and not just the rhythm method, okay.\nOnly 2 percent of U.S. Catholic women of childbearing age actually use this method, according to the Guttmacher Institute."}
