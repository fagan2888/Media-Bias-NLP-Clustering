It cannot operate outside of those limits and must be continuously monitored to ensure compliance.\n\nWill Allison, director of the state\u2019s air pollution control division, said the standards in place will adequately protect the public\u2019s health and environment.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of things in place to ensure this operation is done properly and safely,\u201d Allison said. \u201cWe will ensure those limits are met, and we intend to review all reporting and documentation.\u201d\n\nResidents should know a lengthy process was undertaken that culminated in unanimous approval by the City Council in December after a public hearing in which only a handful of opponents spoke.\n\nThe zoo has been open about its plans since 2009. An article about the plant was included in a zoo publication that went to 65,000 people and information about the plant has been featured on the zoo\u2019s website, e-newsletter and through large scale public events. Zoo officials met with council members, held open houses and tours of the building, presented plans to neighborhood groups and the parks advisory board and even held its own public hearing.\n\nA 51-page engineering design and operations plan explained the project\u2019s technical aspects.\n\nThe zoo is trying to reduce its waste footprint through an innovative way to capture energy. It is a smart plan, one that has gone through extensive review and approval. Continued gripes from some opponents are misguided and, frankly, way too late.\n\nThe only way the council can officially withdraw its support is if something has gone wrong. And that hasn\u2019t happened. The project should move forward. We hope that it will become a model for how institutions can deal with waste and generate energy without endangering the health of the public.\n\nTo send a letter to the editor about this article, submit online or check out our guidelines for how to submit by e-mail or mail.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Let Denver Zoo convert animal waste to fuel", "title": "Let Denver Zoo convert animal waste to fuel", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/09/11/let-denver-zoo-convert-animal-waste-to-fuel/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150911__OP13ZOOPOOPp1.jpg", "height": 415}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150911__OP13ZOOPOOPp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-11T15:22:03+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-21T23:54:17+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The Denver Zoo has suddenly run into a buzz saw of ill-advised opposition over its endeavor to install a waste-to-fuel plant that would convert animal poop and other waste into a power source.\nThe zoo is trying to reduce its waste footprint through an innovative way to capture energy.\nWe hope that it will become a model for how institutions can deal with waste and generate energy without endangering the health of the public.\nThe only way the council can officially withdraw its support is if something has gone wrong.\nThe zoo expects the plant would eliminate 1.5 million pounds of waste it trucks every year to the landfill and cut the amount of electricity it pulls from the grid by 20 percent."}
