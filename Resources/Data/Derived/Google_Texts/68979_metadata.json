(USATSI)\n\nIn the middle of his Twitter rant last week against the NFL and those who run it, former safety Hamza Abdullah admitted he has thought about suicide, even though he has a wife and three children.\n\nThose thoughts apparently aren't unusual, especially when you consider the recent suicides of former players Junior Seau, Dave Duerson and Ray Easterling. And now one of the greatest running backs to pull on a uniform says he, too, has dealt with suicidal thoughts and depression.\n\n\u201cWell, you know, I've been diagnosed with all that,\u201d Dorsett told WFAN radio on Wednesday. \u201cThat's private stuff and I don't want to get into all that stuff, but I've been diagnosed. I'm just telling you, I've been diagnosed with that, yes.\u201d\n\nAlso scary for Dorsett -- who spent 12 years in the league, all but one with the Cowboys, and rushed for 12,739 career yards, the eighth-highest total in NFL history -- is that he said his quality of life is decreasing every day. He says he's losing his memory, and it's so bad that one time he couldn't remember the route to take his children to a team practice.\n\nThe 59-year-old Pro Football Hall of Famer also thinks the NFL should pay for his health insurance.\n\n\u201cAll I want to do is have health insurance for the rest of my life,\u201d Dorsett said. \u201cI signed up for this, obviously. My family is worried about me. I'm worried about me in some respects.\u201d\n\nTo listen to the interview, click here.\n\nFollow Josh Katzowitz on Google+", "article_metadata": {"description": "Tony Dorsett was one of the NFL's best running backs, and now, he says his life quality is decreasing every day.", "og": {"site_name": "CBSSports.com", "description": "Tony Dorsett was one of the NFL's best running backs, and now, he says his life quality is decreasing every day.", "title": "Tony Dorsett says he's losing his memory, struggles with life", "url": "http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/eye-on-football/24195930/tony-dorsett-says-hes-losing-his-memory-struggles-with-life", "image": "http://sports.cbsimg.net/images/blogs/tony-dorsett-depression-11062013.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Tony Dorsett was one of the NFL's best running backs, and now, he says his life quality is decreasing every day.", "title": "Tony Dorsett says he's losing his memory, struggles with life", "url": "http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/eye-on-football/24195930/tony-dorsett-says-hes-losing-his-memory-struggles-with-life", "image": "http://sports.cbsimg.net/images/blogs/tony-dorsett-depression-11062013.jpg", "creator": "@EyeOnNFL", "site": "@cbssports", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"app_id": 297742330311988, "pages": 25902406772}, "vr": {"content_id": 24195930, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "sports news scores information, NFL football MLB baseball NBA basketball live scores news standings teams players, NCAA college basketball football scores news polls rankings, fantasy football news player rankings advice, fantasy baseball basketball news, CBS fantasy sports, golf tennis soccer autos auto racing tour de france, summer winter Olympics, CBSSports.com Sports Line, CBS SportsLine.com", "googlebot": "NOODP"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc693\"", "article_summary": "Former NFL great Tony Dorsett says he's losing his memory.\n\u201cAll I want to do is have health insurance for the rest of my life,\u201d Dorsett said.\nHe says he's losing his memory, and it's so bad that one time he couldn't remember the route to take his children to a team practice.\n\u201cWell, you know, I've been diagnosed with all that,\u201d Dorsett told WFAN radio on Wednesday.\n\u201cThat's private stuff and I don't want to get into all that stuff, but I've been diagnosed."}
