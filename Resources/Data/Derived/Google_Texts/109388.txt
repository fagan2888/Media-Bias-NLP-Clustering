People gathered at Rose Hill Cemetery Saturday morning to celebrate the 101 anniversary of the death and burial of gypsy queen, Kelly Mitchell.

Mitchell died January 31st 1915, in west Alabama while giving birth to her 14th child. Several volunteers dressed in period costumes and told stories of the queen and the show of support at her funeral. Those who put together the celebration talked about the importance of telling the story.

"It is a historic event like no other. There are, I dare say no other historic cemeteries in the southeast that have the king and the queen of the gypsies that's why it is very unusual and we should tell those stories," Rose Hill Cemetery Director Anne McKee says.

The annual Rose Hill Cemetery Costume Tour takes place on the last Saturday in September.
