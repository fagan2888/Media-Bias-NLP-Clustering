The Republican-controlled House has passed smaller measures funding various parts of government to pressure Democrats to keep saying \u201cno.\u201d These included restoring funding for veterans benefits, caring for children with cancer, food assistance and national parks. The House even passed a bill by a vote of 407-0 granting retroactive pay to government workers on furlough. Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) says he won\u2019t bring up a bill to fund the entire government until Barack Obama and the Democrats agree to negotiate deficit spending. The Obama administration and Senate Democrats refuse to budge, believing that the shutdown is only going to hurt Republicans politically. The one thing both sides agree on is that it\u2019s the other side\u2019s fault.\n\nObama did say over the weekend that he\u2019s willing to negotiate changes to ObamaCare \u2026 but only after Republicans end the shutdown with a \u201cclean\u201d continuing resolution and then agree to hike the debt ceiling. That\u2019s convincing \u2013 give him everything he wants and then he\u2019ll talk. Of course, negotiating with Obama is like playing chess with a pigeon. The pigeon knocks over all the pieces, craps on the board and then struts around like it won the game.\n\nMeanwhile, the president continued his gambit to make the shutdown as annoying and inconvenient as possible, erecting Barackades at every national park and closing down every government website \u2013 all of which takes more effort and expense than simply letting things be. Here\u2019s but a short list of closings due to this ridiculous political stunt: The Iwo Jim Memorial is closed, veterans were removed from the Vietnam War Memorial, highway pull-offs with a view of Mount Rushmore are blocked, some of the Florida ocean is off-limits, the Grand Canyon is closed despite Arizona\u2019s offer to keep it open with state funds and 60 families with vacation homes at Lake Mead were ordered to leave.\n\nOne angry Park Ranger confirmed that it\u2019s all politics: \u201cWe\u2019ve been told to make life as difficult for people as we can. It\u2019s disgusting.\u201d It\u2019s also standard operating procedure for Barack Obama.", "article_metadata": {"description": "As the shutdown continues, Obama is making it as annoying as possible.", "csrf-token": "ErBpEeJUajB5w49IdqiPf1FlIHuglfiVlRJFaqhsHIk=", "msapplication-TileColor": "#2b5797", "csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "og": {"site_name": "The Patriot Post", "description": "As the shutdown continues, Obama is making it as annoying as possible.", "title": "Update: Obama's 'Make 'em Suffer' File", "url": "http://patriotpost.us/articles/20664", "image": "http://assets.patriotpost.us/images/2013-10-07-b27d27c0.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100002378661032, "app_id": 217327155053459}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/mstile-144x144.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The one thing both sides agree on is that it\u2019s the other side\u2019s fault.\nSpeaker John Boehner (R-OH) says he won\u2019t bring up a bill to fund the entire government until Barack Obama and the Democrats agree to negotiate deficit spending.\nGovernment & Politics Update: Obama's 'Make 'em Suffer' FileThe federal government has now been shut down for seven days, and the two parties appear no closer to a deal to fund it.\nThe Obama administration and Senate Democrats refuse to budge, believing that the shutdown is only going to hurt Republicans politically.\nThe House even passed a bill by a vote of 407-0 granting retroactive pay to government workers on furlough."}
