On August 5, he hit a peak at 24.3 percent. He then plateaued for a few days and has been falling ever since. He now stands at 22.0 percent.\n\nNot all poll averages show the same thing. I also took a look at Pollster, and they show Trump's climb starting to slow down, but not quite peaking yet. Even there, though, it looks like Trump is going to hit a ceiling soon.\n\nAt the risk of making a hard prediction that will soon look foolish, it looks to me like Trump has peaked at about 25 percent. Even among the Republican base, his blustery showmanship only gets him so far.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "Mother Jones Magazine", "og": {"url": "http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2015/08/trumpmentum-has-been-losing-steam-ever-debate", "site_name": "Mother Jones", "image": "http://www.motherjones.com/files/trumpweb.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Trumpmentum has been losing steam ever since the debate"}, "twitter": {"title": "Trumpmentum has been losing steam ever since the debate", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2015/08/trumpmentum-has-been-losing-steam-ever-debate", "image": {"src": "http://www.motherjones.com/files/trumpweb.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.motherjones.com/files/trumpweb.jpg"}, "creator": "kdrum", "site": "@MotherJones", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-310x150.png", "fb": {"admins": "13301307,670317733,1198876232,38509772,106892,2907757,306289,602422192,4101301,513450539"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-144x144.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-150x150.png"}, "article_summary": "Not all poll averages show the same thing.\nI also took a look at Pollster, and they show Trump's climb starting to slow down, but not quite peaking yet.\nI hopped over to RealClear Politics this morning to take a look at their latest poll averages, and it shows something interesting: Donald Trump may have hit his ceiling.\nEven there, though, it looks like Trump is going to hit a ceiling soon.\nAt the risk of making a hard prediction that will soon look foolish, it looks to me like Trump has peaked at about 25 percent."}
