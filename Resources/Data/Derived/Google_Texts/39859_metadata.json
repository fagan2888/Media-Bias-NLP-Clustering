Could we really be talking about a government shutdown already? The GOP hasn\u2019t even taken control of the Senate yet and already the s-word is being bandied about in the more truculent quarters of the right. At the moment, it remains there \u2013 party leadership wants another shutdown like it wants a third Obama term \u2013 but, yeah, we\u2019ve seen this show before.\n\nAt issue is the political dirty bomb President Barack Obama dropped into the middle of the GOP last month when he announced that he was acting unilaterally to overhaul the nation\u2019s immigration policies. As I wrote in this space last month, I disagree with the move as the next step in the broader elimination of political norms which have helped the government function (filibusters used rarely and debt ceiling extortion not used as a tool for major policy overhauls, for example).\n\nRepublicans, predictably, denounced the plan in somewhat more pointed terms \u2013 as an unconstitutional dictatorial power-grab. \u201cThe House will, in fact, act,\u201d Speaker John Boehner promised reporters before Thanksgiving, and incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell made similar comments.\n\n\n\n[SEE: Editorial Cartoons on the Republican Party]\n\nThe problem Republican leaders face is that given the separation of powers and the burgeoning reach of executive authority over the last half-century, there is little Congress can do. They essentially have a fly swatter and a nuke: They can inveigh impotently, or they can shut down the government (\u201cuse the power of the purse\u201d is the term of art for those wishing to avoid the s-word). As Boehner conceded this week, \u201cFrankly, we have limited options and limited abilities to deal with it directly.\u201d\n\nNot surprisingly, given their desire to prove to voters that they can govern responsibly \u2013 a concept which does not include shutdowns \u2013 congressional GOP leaders are trying to thread the needle, striking a sufficiently belligerent pose to appease their base while stopping short of exercising their nuclear option. First, they voted Thursday on a House bill that would ban Obama from changing immigration laws through executive order (a piece of legislation proposed by Florida GOP Rep. Ted Yoho, whose legislative credentials include, as the Washington Post put it this week, having \u201ctalked up impeachment more than almost any other House Republican\u201d). This is spleen-venting: The legislation won\u2019t see the light of day in the for-now Democratic Senate. House Republicans plan to next pass a spending bill which will keep most of the government running through the remainder of the fiscal year but will cut off funding for the Department of Homeland Security (which enforces immigration policies) in February, setting up a confrontation with the president on one side and the unified Republican Congress on the other.\n\n\n\n[SEE: Political Cartoons on President Obama]\n\nIf this plan \u2013 give the GOP base symbolic express-your-outrage votes in order to avoid an immediate and politically toxic showdown \u2013 sounds familiar, that\u2019s because it is. You might recall how it worked out a year ago when it was called the \u201cCantor plan,\u201d and was devised to forestall a government shutdown over Obamacare. The idea, then, was that the House would pass a spending bill which defunded Obamacare but with a provision allowing the Senate to keep the funding and send a clean bill to Obama. That plan crashed under a conservative rebellion. Instead we got last year\u2019s shutdown.\n\nHere we go again? There are reasons to argue for and against the likelihood of a shutdown, in the spring if not now. On the one hand, starting in January, Boehner will have a bigger and more ideologically diverse House Republican Conference. This isn\u2019t to say that he will be overseeing a moderate party but it will have more moderates. This could give him more maneuvering room to bypass his hardliners. \u201cNext year, GOP leadership sources promise, they\u2019ll ignore the far right and make progress with an easier group of lawmakers,\u201d Politico\u2019s Jake Sherman and John Bresnahan reported this week.\n\n\n\n[SEE: Editorial Cartoons on the Government Shutdown]\n\nAnd there are broader political concerns, starting with the fact that the party\u2019s approval-disapproval ratings plummeted (which is pretty incredible given how low they started) during the shutdown last year. Then there\u2019s the fraught politics of potentially engineering a government shutdown in order to more aggressively deport millions of people living in the U.S. illegally. A recent Latino Decisions poll, for example, found that 89 percent of Latinos support Obama\u2019s executive action and will support a 2016 candidate who promises to continue it.\n\nOn the other hand, not everyone draws the same lessons from the 2013 experience. \u201cWe had a shutdown a year ago, and we just got the biggest majority we\u2019ve ever had in the House since 1928, and one of the largest majorities we\u2019ve ever had in the Senate,\u201d Idaho GOP Rep. Ra\u00fal Labrador, a tea party leader, told reporters this week. \u201cSo I don\u2019t understand their reasoning for taking anything off the table,\u201d including a shutdown.\n\nAnd consider the sort of apocalyptic rhetoric being deployed in response to Obama\u2019s move: \u201cThis is not a matter to be discussed at some point,\u201d Alabama right wing Sen. Jeff Sessions told Politico. \u201cIt\u2019s an unacceptable aggrandizement of power that Congress has an institutional duty to reject.\u201d Also it\u2019s \u201ca serious breach of our Constitution\u201d and \u201ca serious threat to our system of government.\u201d Oh wait, that last wasn\u2019t a member of the \u201cHell No\u201d caucus but rather was Boehner himself, who nevertheless proposes to address this existential crisis with stern words but \u2013 heavens no! \u2013 not with the other weapon available to him.", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Politics [News]", "title": "A Government Shutdown Over Obama's Immigration Actions?", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Heated rhetoric and attempts to appease conservatives ... this all sounds very familiar.", "title": "\u2019Tis the Season to Talk Shutdown", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/opinion/articles/2014/12/06/a-government-shutdown-over-obamas-immigration-actions", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/a6/575614c6bc42375b7843be0d9fd911/media:2a447c1b392e40698d87ff87e2568c8eCongressBoehner.JPEG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Heated rhetoric and attempts to appease conservatives ... this all sounds very familiar.", "site": "@USNews", "card": "summary", "title": "A Government Shutdown Over Obama's Immigration Actions?"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "opinion", "date_published": "Dec. 6, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Robert Schlesinger,Republican Party,Congress,Obama, Barack,politics,picks,tea party,Politics [News]", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Heated rhetoric and attempts to appease conservatives ... this all sounds very familiar."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc645\"", "article_summary": "On the one hand, starting in January, Boehner will have a bigger and more ideologically diverse House Republican Conference.\nAt the moment, it remains there \u2013 party leadership wants another shutdown like it wants a third Obama term \u2013 but, yeah, we\u2019ve seen this show before.\nThere are reasons to argue for and against the likelihood of a shutdown, in the spring if not now.\n\u201cSo I don\u2019t understand their reasoning for taking anything off the table,\u201d including a shutdown.\nThen there\u2019s the fraught politics of potentially engineering a government shutdown in order to more aggressively deport millions of people living in the U.S. illegally."}
