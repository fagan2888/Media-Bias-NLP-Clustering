Expect sun, sun and more sun, this week in Denver, as the weather settles into a normal pattern for this time of year, according to the National Weather Service.

Sunday “is going to be pretty dang nice,” as in sunny, with highs in the low 60s, said Kari Bowen, NWS meteorologist.

Monday will be more or less the same, with winds picking up in the afternoon and gusts as high as 25 mph.

Tuesday through Thursday will be mostly sunny, she said.

“Temperatures are starting to slowly increase,” Bowen said, and are more or less average for this time of year.

Temperatures in the foothills are expected to be similar to Denver’s, but with stronger breezes, Bowen said.

In the high country, there is a 10 percent chance of light snow on Sunday, with light accumulation on Monday, and high temperatures in the 30s. Winds could gust as high as 30 mph, Bowen said.

“We are not looking at a lot of accumulation, but are going to get the wind chill effect, as low as negative 1,” degrees, she said.
