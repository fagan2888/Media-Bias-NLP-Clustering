Cannon - June 1, 2014\n\nI\u2019ve never met Larry Kramer, but he and I have something in common: In the 1980s, we found Gary Bauer maddeningly obtuse on the question of whether Ronald Reagan should speak to Americans about the AIDS epidemic.\n\nI was a reporter in the San Jose Mercury News Washington bureau covering the federal response to the epidemic. Bauer was a Reagan administration official aligned with other social conservatives resistant to having the president play a visible role on AIDS. Kramer was, and remains, a prominent gay rights activist.\n\nIn early 1987, after Bauer became chief White House domestic policy adviser, prominent voices in the medical community were calling for Reagan to deliver a major address about the crisis. Why have a \u201cGreat Communicator\u201d in office, they said, if he won\u2019t communicate the message that safe sex is a matter of life-or-death?\n\nI put that question to Bauer in March of that year. He expressed dismay at the thought of a U.S. president uttering the word \u201ccondom.\u201d But with so many people dying of this disease, I found his concern callous\u2014and told him so.\n\nLarry Kramer tells a similar tale, but with more sinister undertones. He claims that in \u201ca personal communication with me in his White House office in April of 1983,\u201d Bauer told him that the president was \u201cirrevocably opposed to anything having to do with homosexuality.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m skeptical. For starters, in 1983 Gary Bauer didn\u2019t work in the White House; he was a mid-level functionary in the Department of Education. More importantly, even before he became president, Reagan had proven the opposite of \u201cirrevocably opposed\u201d to gays, and had demonstrated this tolerance at substantial risk to his presidential ambitions. One can argue that no American politician ever confronted anti-gay prejudice more courageously.\n\nThat was in 1978. I was covering education for a California newspaper at the time. Three years removed from the governorship, Reagan was the anointed hero of American conservatism and the presumptive 1980 Republican presidential nominee when an Orange County state legislator, John Briggs, spearheaded a ballot initiative called Proposition 6 to bar gays and lesbians from teaching in public schools.\n\nReagan\u2019s political handlers advised him to steer clear, but gay Republicans privately asked him to get involved, as did some Democratic friends and some Hollywood pals. Briggs, who wrongly assumed Reagan was on his side, publicly goaded him, too.\n\nIntensive politicking by the California\u2019s liberal establishment had pared Proposition 6\u2019s support from a whopping 75 percent to 55 percent, but that\u2019s where the needle stayed\u2014until Reagan spoke out. In September, he told reporters of his opposition, and followed up with an op-ed saying Proposition 6 would do \u201creal mischief.\u201d Support for it eroded, even in Briggs\u2019 home county, and it lost handily.\n\nOne of those who\u2019d urged Reagan to intervene was Los Angeles gay activist David Mixner, a friend of future president Bill Clinton. \u201cNever have I been treated more graciously by a human being,\u201d Mixner said of his meeting with Reagan. \u201cHe turned opinion around and saved that election for us. He just thought it was wrong and came out against it.\u201d\n\nThis didn\u2019t surprise those who knew Reagan. Like most movie actors, he had several gay friends. But even this is used against him by partisans. \u201cReagan did not even mention the word AIDS,\u201d Washington Post columnist Richard Cohen wrote last week, \u201cuntil the disease was impossible to ignore and his friend Rock Hudson had died from it.\u201d\n\nThis is almost true. It was Hudson who wouldn\u2019t discuss AIDS; Reagan actually mentioned the disease publicly for the first time two weeks before his friend passed away. But Cohen gets his information about Reagan and AIDS from Larry Kramer\u2014his column was touting Kramer\u2019s new HBO movie\u2014and Kramer is not a reliable source on the 40th president.\n\nHe often claims that Reagan never mentioned AIDS for the first seven years of his presidency. Although this falsehood is easily checked, it has spread, like its own kind of virus, into official government documents, liberals\u2019 institutional memories, and countless news accounts from organizations with contrary evidence in their own files. It\u2019s a fabrication with consequences. Three years after Reagan\u2019s death, a New York Review of Books essay offering a measured reassessment of Reagan prompted this response from Kramer:\n\n\u201cRonald Reagan may have done laudable things but he was also a monster and, in my estimation, responsible for more deaths than Adolf Hitler,\u201d he wrote. \u201cHe is one of the persons most responsible for allowing the plague of AIDS to grow from 41 cases in 1981 to over 70 million today. He refused to even say the word out loud for the first seven years of his presidency and when he did speak about it, it was with disdain.\u201d\n\nComparing a political opponent to Hitler is obvious evidence of fanaticism, but we are living in hyper-partisan times. Rep. Henry Waxman\u2019s official congressional website repeats the \u201cseven years\u201d calumny while adding that \u201cthe Reagan administration consistently refused to commit the resources and effort necessary to provide urgently needed research, health care, and preventive services.\u201d\n\nFor the record, Reagan first mentioned AIDS, in response to a question at a press conference, on Sept. 17, 1985. On Feb. 5, 1986, he made a surprise visit to the Department of Health and Human Services where he said, \u201cOne of our highest public health priorities is going to be continuing to find a cure for AIDS.\u201d He also announced that he\u2019d tasked Surgeon General C. Everett Koop to prepare a major report on the disease. Contrary to the prevailing wisdom, Reagan dragged Koop into AIDS policy, not the other way around.\n\nAs for Waxman\u2019s recollections about AIDS funding, he does an unusual thing for a politician: He\u2019s forgotten the success he and other Democrats had in convincing Reagan to spend more money. The administration increased AIDS funding requests from $8 million in 1982 to $26.5 million in 1983, which Congress bumped to $44 million, a number that doubled every year thereafter during Reagan\u2019s presidency.\n\nFinally, the claim that Reagan spoke about AIDS sufferers with \u201cdisdain\u201d is simply a smear. Nothing like that ever happened, except maybe in the fictional \u201cThe Reagans\u201d miniseries in which Barbra Streisand\u2019s husband played Reagan as a bigot and rube.\n\nIn real life\u2014that is to say in 1983, early in the AIDS crisis\u2014HHS Secretary Margaret Heckler (accompanied by New York City Mayor Ed Koch, another Larry Kramer target), went to the hospital bedside of a 40-year-old AIDS patient named Peter Justice. Heckler, a devout Catholic, held the dying man\u2019s hand, both out of compassion and to allay fears about how the disease was spread.\n\n\u201cWe ought to be comforting the sick,\u201d said Ronald Reagan\u2019s top-ranking health official, \u201crather than afflicting them and making them a class of outcasts.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m delighted she\u2019s here,\u201d Justice said. \u201cI\u2019m delighted she cares.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "I\u2019ve never met Larry Kramer, but he and I have something in common: In the 1980s, we found Gary Bauer maddeningly obtuse on the question of whether Ronald Reagan should speak to Americans about...", "title": "Ronald Reagan and AIDS: Correcting the Record | RealClearPolitics", "og": {"url": "http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2014/06/01/ronald_reagan_and_aids_correcting_the_record_122806.html", "image": "http://images.rcp.realclearpolitics.com/110916_2_.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "I\u2019ve never met Larry Kramer, but he and I have something in common: In the 1980s, we found Gary Bauer maddeningly obtuse on the question of whether Ronald Reagan should speak to Americans about...", "title": "Ronald Reagan and AIDS: Correcting the Record | RealClearPolitics"}, "twitter": {"site": "@rcp_articles", "card": "summary"}, "tweetmeme-title": "Ronald Reagan and AIDS: Correcting the Record | RealClearPolitics", "fb": {"app_id": 1415921935346245}, "keywords": "Larry Kramer,AIDS,Ronald Reagan,", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=1"}, "article_summary": "It was Hudson who wouldn\u2019t discuss AIDS; Reagan actually mentioned the disease publicly for the first time two weeks before his friend passed away.\nBauer was a Reagan administration official aligned with other social conservatives resistant to having the president play a visible role on AIDS.\nMore importantly, even before he became president, Reagan had proven the opposite of \u201cirrevocably opposed\u201d to gays, and had demonstrated this tolerance at substantial risk to his presidential ambitions.\n\u201cWe ought to be comforting the sick,\u201d said Ronald Reagan\u2019s top-ranking health official, \u201crather than afflicting them and making them a class of outcasts.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m delighted she\u2019s here,\u201d Justice said.\nHe often claims that Reagan never mentioned AIDS for the first seven years of his presidency."}
