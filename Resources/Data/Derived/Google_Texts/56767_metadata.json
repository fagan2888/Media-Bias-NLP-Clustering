The U.S. is paying the Russian firm to manufacture 30 MI-17 helicopters for use by Afghan National Security Forces.\n\n\u201cGiven Russia\u2019s recent actions that violate the sovereignty and territorial integrity Ukraine, including its support of the illegal referendum for Crimean separation, we strongly urge you to terminate these contracts,\u201d Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-CT) wrote in a letter, cosigned by four other lawmakers, addressed to Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel. They said the Pentagon has the authority to exercise what\u2019s known as the convenience clause and sever ties with Rosoboronexport.\n\nRelated: Pressure on Putin as Russian Wealth Disappears\n\nThat would not leave the U.S. with fiscally sound options, though, according to some experts.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a challenge because if you do want to sanction Russia, failing to sanction its arms export company seems like a big gap,\u201d said Olga Oliker, associate director of the International Security and Defense Policy Center at the RAND Corporation. \u201cBut it\u2019s not as simple as \u2018Let\u2019s just buy another helicopter.\u2019 Any U.S. helicopter is going to flat out cost more and require more maintenance and training.\u201d\n\nAfghans have been using the Russian-made helicopters for decades, in part because of their simplicity and high level of performance amid the mountainous terrain. Critics of the U.S.-Rosoboronexport partnership say that while American-made helicopters would cost more, it\u2019s an investment worth making.\n\nRelated: Russia\u2019s Move in Crimea Sends China a Dangerous Message\n\n\u201cThe Pentagon should cancel this contract,\u201d said Christopher Griffin, executive director of the Foreign Policy Initiative. \u201cRosoboronexport is not a partner of the U.S.\u201d\n\nHe said the least expensive option isn\u2019t always the best and noted that Afghanistan has been requesting more U.S. and NATO sourced material.\n\nThe National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal 2014, signed into law by President Obama in December, prohibits the Pentagon from using funds for future contracts with Rosoboronexport unless the Defense Department says doing so is in the interest of national security. The Pentagon has already said it doesn\u2019t plan on purchasing more of the Russian-made helicopters beyond the existing contract.\n\n\u201cWhile we are pleased to see that future business with Rosoboronexport is terminated, we firmly believe that given Russia's recent escalation of the crisis in Ukraine, current contracts with the Russian arms dealer must be terminated as well,\" the lawmakers wrote yesterday.\n\nRelated: Putin\u2019s Oligarchs Are Key to War and Peace in Ukraine\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time lawmakers have made the request. Last year, a bipartisan group of senators \u2013 seven Republicans and five Democrats \u2013 sent a now prescient letter to Army General Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, calling on the Pentagon to sever its business ties with Rosoboronexport, mainly because of the firm\u2019s ties to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.\n\n\u201cWe are concerned by DoD\u2019s apparent failure to consider the strategic implications of sourcing mission-critical military equipment from a potentially hostile power such as Russia\u201d the lawmakers wrote in August.\n\nObama today announced sanctions against 20 Russian citizens and a St. Petersburg-based bank.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The Pentagon continues to do business with Russia\u2019s state-owned arms exporter, despite calls from lawmakers to sever all ties in the wake of the crisis in Crimea.", "title": "The US-Russia Military Supply Chain Could Snap", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/03/20/US-Russia-Military-Supply-Chain-Could-Snap", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/09062013_Obama_Putin.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/03/20/US-Russia-Military-Supply-Chain-Could-Snap", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/09062013_Obama_Putin.jpg", "creator": "@timothyrhoman", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The Pentagon continues to do business with Russia\u2019s state-owned arms exporter, despite calls from lawmakers to sever all ties in the wake of the crisis in Crimea.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc8bc\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWe are concerned by DoD\u2019s apparent failure to consider the strategic implications of sourcing mission-critical military equipment from a potentially hostile power such as Russia\u201d the lawmakers wrote in August.\nThey said the Pentagon has the authority to exercise what\u2019s known as the convenience clause and sever ties with Rosoboronexport.\nThe U.S. is paying the Russian firm to manufacture 30 MI-17 helicopters for use by Afghan National Security Forces.\nThe Defense Department continues to do business with Russia\u2019s state-owned arms exporter, and Congress wants that to stop.\nThe Pentagon has already said it doesn\u2019t plan on purchasing more of the Russian-made helicopters beyond the existing contract."}
