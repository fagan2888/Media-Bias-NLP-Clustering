1 on One

For the 10 years that Lisa, 40, and her husband Bill, 42, have been married, they’ve been fighting about money. Lisa says that she feels “stuck and depressed”. She thinks that Bill needs to make more money, like bartending on weekends. She feels that the pressure is on her to make money.

Suze asks Bill if Lisa always blames him. “Bill, why don’t you make more money? Why don’t you spend less money?” Bill says, “It’s definitely ‘why don’t you make more money?'” He says that she keeps pushing the “Make More Money” button.

Debt Consumer Debt $3,760.00 Mortgage Debt $333,389.00 Total Debt $337,149.00 Savings Liquid $28,000.00 Current Home Value $490,000.00 Investments $17,000.00 Retirement $9,678.00 Total Assets $544,678.00

Suze tells them that they’re retirement is “bad”, which they acknowledge, of course. Their problem is that Lisa’s whole salary goes to paying for their house and Bill’s money all goes to his business. So they borrow from credit cards to pay themselves.

Lisa says that she’s willing to cut down on all other expenses, but wants to keep the house. This is my 1st time to see someone resist Suze so openly in the 9 months that I’ve recapped the show. Suze tells Lisa that she doesn’t want to change anything.

Can i Afford It?

Suze denies Mark a $50,000 basement rec room for the kids & a “man cave” for the adults, to entertain. Suze points out to him that the man cave is his, and not have anything to do with his wife. Suze also denies Lisa 2 Cher concert tickets that cost $1,000, because of her credit card debt.

Callers who go on the show get “Approved” or “Denied” shirts.
