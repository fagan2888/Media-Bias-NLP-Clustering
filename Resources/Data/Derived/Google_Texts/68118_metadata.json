Protesters were charged with engaging in a loud protest at the Capitol, a misdemeanor under state law, after rallying against Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal\u2019s refusal to expand Medicaid as part of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nGeorgia\u2019s Moral Mondays mirror the movement that started last year in North Carolina after a series of restrictive measures in that state, including cuts to unemployment benefits and a bizarre bill in which motorcycle safety and anti-abortion measures were pieced together, were pushed by a Republican-led legislature.\n\nWhile this week\u2019s Moral Monday was forced by a St. Patrick\u2019s Day legislative closure to be Moral Tuesday, there have been protests at the Georgia state Capitol since January, Herbert Buchsbaum at The New York Times reports. The paper calls Moral Mondays a \u201cbudding liberal movement\u201d in a part of the country where the many focuses of the liberal cause, including public education and voting rights, have been hit particularly hard. Medicaid expansion is the main issue in Georgia and South Carolina, where federal funds to pay for the program have been turned down by both states. In South Carolina, the movement goes by Truthful Tuesday.\n\nInstead of being just a liberal novelty and, at worst, a fringe movement, protesters hope to translate their persistent campaign into meaningful politics in a region dominated by conservatism. Employing an almost-aggressively Southern metaphor, Buchsbaum calls the entrenched Republican control of government in the South, \u201cas solid as cold grits,\" adding that for Democrats, mere survival trumps influence.\n\nThe movement, however, is a determined one. One Moral Monday activist, Timothy McDonald, told Atlanta\u2019s WSB-TV, \"It's growing, and we know that this is not an event. This is the movement, and it's going to take time.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are at the beginning of a new Southern strategy. The changes we need to make in Georgia to transform the state are going to take years. But with the changing demographics of the South, our victory is inevitable. This train has left the station,\u201d Tim Franzen, lead organizer behind Georgia\u2019s Moral Mondays, told the Times.\n\nOne of the 41 protestors arrested \u2014 who were mainly senior citizens, according to the Atlanta Constitution-Journal \u2014 included Dr. Raphael Warnock of Ebenezer Baptist Church, where Rev. Martin Luther King was pastor, who staged a sit-in outside Deal\u2019s office. Warnock told a group of about 100 supporters, \u201cIt is no exaggeration to say we are here on a matter of life and death,\u201d report Janel Davis and Chris Joyner at the Journal-Constitution. Protesters were also arrested when they tried to block the door to the Senate.\n\nGeorgia Sen. Judson Hill, a Republican, supported Deal\u2019s decision not to expand, calling Medicaid \u201ca bill that Georgia and America cannot afford,\u201d while Georgia Sen. Donzella James, a Democrat whose husband is also hospitalized, called out Republicans for opposing expansion on political, not financial, grounds, the Journal-Constitution reports.\n\nWhile there are busy days ahead as Thursday marks the final workday of Georgia's current legislative session, the movement doesn't look set to retreat any time soon.", "article_metadata": {"description": "More than 40 people were arrested in Atlanta on Tuesday as the progressive Moral Monday movement expanded deeper into the hostile territory of the South.", "title": "News, opinion and aggregation on business, politics, entertainment, technology, global and national \u2013 The Wire", "og": {"site_name": "The Wire", "description": "More than 40 people were arrested in Atlanta on Tuesday as the progressive Moral Monday movement expanded deeper into the hostile territory of the South.", "title": "The 'Moral Monday' Movement Spreads Across South", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.thewire.com/media/img/upload/wire/2014/03/19/moralmonday_resize/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.thewire.com/politics/2014/03/moral-monday-movement-spreads-across-south-41-arrested-georgia-protests/359333/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "More than 40 people were arrested in Atlanta on Tuesday as the progressive Moral Monday movement expanded deeper into the hostile territory of the South.", "title": "The 'Moral Monday' Movement Spreads Across South", "image": "http://cdn.thewire.com/media/img/upload/wire/2014/03/19/moralmonday_resize/lead_large.jpg", "creator": "@lvzwestcott", "site": "@thewire", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "app_id": 192759427473466}, "keywords": "The Wire, TheWire.com, TheWire.com, news, opinion, aggregation, business, politics, entertainment, technology, global, national", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheAtlanticWire"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "This train has left the station,\u201d Tim Franzen, lead organizer behind Georgia\u2019s Moral Mondays, told the Times.\nMore than 40 people were arrested in Atlanta on Tuesday as the progressive Moral Monday movement expanded deeper into the hostile territory of the South.\nThe paper calls Moral Mondays a \u201cbudding liberal movement\u201d in a part of the country where the many focuses of the liberal cause, including public education and voting rights, have been hit particularly hard.\nWhile this week\u2019s Moral Monday was forced by a St. Patrick\u2019s Day legislative closure to be Moral Tuesday, there have been protests at the Georgia state Capitol since January, Herbert Buchsbaum at The New York Times reports.\nInstead of being just a liberal novelty and, at worst, a fringe movement, protesters hope to translate their persistent campaign into meaningful politics in a region dominated by conservatism."}
