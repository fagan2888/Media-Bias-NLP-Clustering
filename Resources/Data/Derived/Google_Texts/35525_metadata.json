California law also prohibits the state government from bailing out its exchange, Covered California.\n\nUnlike some other state exchanges, Covered California hasn\u2019t quite spent all its federal aid; $200 million is being set aside to cover its near-term deficit. But that money isn\u2019t going to last long: The exchange is expecting to end up nearly $80 million in the red this year. According to the Orange County Register, \u201cCovered California Executive Director Peter Lee acknowledged in December that there are questions about the \u2018long-term sustainability of the organization.\u2019\u201d\n\nSuch questions are not new, the paper observed, pointing out that \u201ca 2013 report by the state auditor \u2026 stated that, until the state\u2019s health insurance exchange actually started enrolling Californians in health plans, its \u2018future solvency\u2019 was \u2018uncertain.\u2019 Thus, Covered California was listed as a \u2018high-risk\u2019 issue for the state.\u201d\n\nThe exchange enrolled almost 1.4 million Californians last year, yet this year it has managed to increase that enrollment by only one percent, according to a recent study by healthcare consulting firm Avalere Health. Only Vermont\u2019s and Washington\u2019s exchanges \u2014 the latter also frequently hailed as an ObamaCare triumph \u2014 performed worse, actually enrolling fewer people in 2015 than in 2014.\n\nA significant reason for California\u2019s meager enrollment growth is that many of last year\u2019s enrollees declined to enroll this year; the state\u2019s enrollee-retention rate was just 65.3 percent. This is the product of several factors. For one thing, the state shifted about 200,000 people who attempted to enroll in exchange coverage into Medi-Cal, California\u2019s version of Medicaid. In addition, nearly one-fifth of those who signed up for coverage in 2014 failed to pay their first premiums and therefore were not counted as having enrolled, meaning they also can\u2019t qualify as having re-enrolled this year. Also, as the Sacramento Bee reported, \u201cMany people received confusing notices telling them, for instance, to sign up for Covered California even though they already had coverage. The Covered California website was glitchy, and wait times on the phone were long.\u201d And more than a few of last year\u2019s enrollees were probably unhappy with the cost and quality of their coverage. (One gauge of the exchange\u2019s popularity: All seven Democrats on the state assembly\u2019s rules committee voted against a bill that would have required legislators to enroll in Covered California.)\n\nHigh enrollment is key to making the exchange solvent. Its funding comes from a $13.95 per-member per- month assessment on exchange plans. (Yes, the ACA makes health insurance \u201caffordable\u201d by piling on hefty user fees.) That fee was supposed to drop below $10 by the end of fiscal 2016, but lack of participation has kept it at its original level. The state has tried to boost enrollment this year by twice extending the enrollment period after the head count fell 300,000 short of goal following the initial period.\n\n\u201cIf [Covered California] continues to run yearly operating deficits,\u201d noted the Register, \u201cit will not long survive.\u201d\n\nCalifornia is hardly alone in its ObamaCare woes.\n\n\u201cMany state-based exchanges have a good amount of work to do before they find a sustainable financial model,\u201d Avalere Health director Elizabeth Carpenter told Modern Healthcare in January.\n\nAmong the reasons for exchanges\u2019 financial troubles, according to the magazine:\n\nState legislators have been reluctant to establish or increase fees on premiums to support exchange operations. Solving unexpectedly severe website technology problems has cost a lot of money. In states with fee assessments on exchange-plan premiums, smaller-than-expected enrollment has yielded inadequate revenue. And the problem is circular: Cutting back exchange activities because of budget shortfalls has hurt outreach and sign-up efforts, further reducing enrollment.\n\nDan Schuyler, senior director of exchange technology at consultancy Leavitt Partners, told Modern Healthcare that \u201cfinancial sustainability is one of the main impediments holding states back from creating their own exchanges.\u201d This, the periodical forecast, \u201ccould become a major problem for the Obama administration\u201d if the Supreme Court rules that premium subsidies cannot be offered on the federal exchange, forcing states either to establish their own exchanges or to see their residents lose subsidies.\n\nOf course, the administration could do as it has done so many times before: simply ignore the law and continue to dispense grants to foundering exchanges. Modern Healthcare pointed out that already the self-sufficiency \u201cmandate is being ignored across the country,\u201d with the administration permitting exchanges to rely on leftover federal funds from previous years. Moreover, when asked point-blank by Representative James Lankford (R-Okla.) in December if states would continue to \u201cget federal dollars, contrary to the law saying they must be self-sufficient,\u201d CMS administrator Marilyn Tavenner declined to answer.\n\nBarack Obama, however, will not be president much longer; and his successor, particularly if he is not a Democrat, may be disinclined to keep pouring taxpayer dollars into the exchanges. At that point, the exchanges are likely to drown in red ink.\n\nFew states have good plans for funding their exchanges. Most, like California, rely on user fees, but even those rarely cover costs. \u201cThree states \u2014 New Mexico, Rhode Island and Vermont \u2014 have yet to establish any means of paying for exchange operations,\u201d penned Modern Healthcare. Those states that want to keep their exchanges afloat will have little choice but to increase fees, apply them to non-exchange plans (as is already being done in four states plus the District of Columbia), or impose or hike other taxes.\n\nThings are looking so bad in some states that they are considering shuttering their exchanges and dumping their residents onto the federal exchange. Oregon, after a major website crash and subsequent difficulties, has already done so.\n\nIn short, the state exchanges, like the rest of ObamaCare, are unsustainable, debt-ridden train wrecks. Clearing the tracks of these and other impediments to a free market in healthcare ought to be a top priority for every elected official in this country. The people\u2019s, states\u2019, and nation\u2019s health depends on it.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "ObamaCare, California, Covered California, deficits, enrollment, exchanges", "og": {"url": "http://www.thenewamerican.com/usnews/health-care/item/20744-state-obamacare-exchanges-drowning-in-red-ink", "image": "http://www.thenewamerican.com/media/k2/items/cache/6f79a870993d2847b2f1713df729f38f_XL.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "California's ObamaCare exchange is running deep deficits and has no real plan to become solvent in the future \u2014 and many other states are facing the same situation. by Michael Tennant", "title": "State ObamaCare Exchanges Drowning in Red Ink"}, "image": "http://www.thenewamerican.com/media/k2/items/cache/6f79a870993d2847b2f1713df729f38f_XL.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdeee3\"", "article_summary": "In short, the state exchanges, like the rest of ObamaCare, are unsustainable, debt-ridden train wrecks.\nUnlike some other state exchanges, Covered California hasn\u2019t quite spent all its federal aid; $200 million is being set aside to cover its near-term deficit.\nCalifornia law also prohibits the state government from bailing out its exchange, Covered California.\n\u201cIf [Covered California] continues to run yearly operating deficits,\u201d noted the Register, \u201cit will not long survive.\u201dCalifornia is hardly alone in its ObamaCare woes.\nAlso, as the Sacramento Bee reported, \u201cMany people received confusing notices telling them, for instance, to sign up for Covered California even though they already had coverage."}
