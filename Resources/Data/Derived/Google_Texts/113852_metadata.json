THEN Phyllis sporting her colour-block dress in 1974\n\n\u2018Mum has four wardrobes full of gems from the 1960s, 70s and 80s\u2019\n\nHazel Holtham, 35, a fashion entrepreneur from London, is spoilt for choice because her seamstress mum Phyllis has never thrown her clothes away.\n\nHazel As children, my sisters Tracy, now 36, and Susan, 27, and I weren\u2019t allowed anywhere near my Mum\u2019s wardrobes, but as soon as she went out, we\u2019d be in there, sighing over her Cellophane-wrapped dresses in jewel colours. Mum is an expert seamstress and made many of them in Grenada in the 1960s, before moving to the UK in 1972 when she married my dad, an Oxford professor.\n\nIn recent years, she\u2019s had an annual wardrobe edit, and when we go home to Middlesex at Christmas we find a pile of goodies she\u2019s sorted out for us in our old bedrooms. A couple of years ago she gave me a cool 70s jumpsuit (below) in the kind of fuchsia pink you don\u2019t see now. She never dressed like the other mums at school pick-up. My friends always ask, \u2018Is that one of your mum\u2019s?\u2019 She\u2019s a bit of a legend!\n\nThe colour-block dress (above) from 1972 was something I borrowed for a party last summer. Mum wouldn\u2019t let me keep it \u2013 she\u2019s precious about certain pieces. It has an appliqu\u00e9 tortoise \u2013 so cute. I\u2019ve worn it twice \u2013 with Swedish Hasbeens in summer, and thick tights and ankle boots in winter. I\u2019m a size smaller than her, so I cinch it in with a belt. She has a white crochet dress that I covet but she won\u2019t let me borrow it (even though I\u2019m much more careful with her clothes than my own!) because it has sentimental value \u2013 she wore it to Tracy\u2019s christening. Mum\u2019s vintage hats are also out of bounds because she still wears them, so I have to source my own, usually at Judy\u2019s Affordable Vintage Fairs (judysvintagefair.co.uk). Her hand-me-downs act as a barometer \u2013 if Mum wore it, it must be fabulous. She inspired my career as a vintage stylist, and I\u2019ve sourced similarly cool outfits for Florence Welch and Lily Collins.\n\nHazel is director of Rag and Bow: the Roaming Vintage Store; ragandbow.com\n\nNOW Hazel brings Phyllis's jumpsuit up to date. THEN Phyllis wearing her jumpsuit in 1968\n\nPhyllis I am very attached to the colour-block tortoise dress because I wore it just once, for the reading of my marriage banns in 1972. As I got out of the car with my husband, the priest asked, \u2018Who is this pretty girl?\u2019 The jumpsuit dates back to a fashion show\n\nI took part in back in Grenada in 1970. All the girls had dresses made for the event, but I created my own, having taught myself to sew and pattern cut at 13. Nobody had seen a jumpsuit before. Hazel looks just like me at that age, from the hat to the poses.\n\nNOW Lilly styles her mum's 80s jumpsuit\n\nTHEN Jacqueline snapped wearing it in 1984\n\n\u2018Mum is smug about my sudden style turnaround\u2019\n\nLilly Cullen, 22, a style blogger from London, used to hate her mother Jacqueline\u2019s \u2018ugly\u2019 1980s and 90s clothes, but now they\u2019re her go-to pieces.\n\nLilly I\u2019ve never thought of my mum as stylish. In fact, I used to hate her Wrangler jeans with their drop crotch and saggy bum \u2013 I remember calling her \u2018nappy pants\u2019! But then the 1980s and 90s revival came about and I was all over her old clothes. Mum smiled smugly and said, \u2018I thought they were horrible?\u2019 At first it was her denim shorts and Dr Martens boots that I borrowed, but more recently I\u2019ve been wearing her high-waisted Wranglers; they fit perfectly as I\u2019m exactly the same size as Mum was then.\n\nAs a style blogger (fashionscholar.com), I appreciate East London street style, and the early 90s \u2018ugly shirt\u2019 trend has seen me borrowing several of Mum\u2019s, including a striped one. I\u2019ve recently found photos of Mum, now 47, at my age wearing near identical outfits to me. It\u2019s spooky because I\u2019ve put the same loud tops, jeans and necklaces together as she did. A couple of years ago I discovered her white 80s jumpsuit (above). I wore it with a distressed top, then found a photo of Mum wearing it with a similar ripped T-shirt. I\u2019m going to pair it with a kimono next.\n\nJacqueline I hung on to my old jeans because Wranglers and Levi\u2019s are made of quality denim that lasts for years. As for the shirts and jumpsuit that Lilly now wears, I didn\u2019t even know I\u2019d kept them until I found a box of clothes in the loft. They brought memories flooding back. I stole the striped shirt from a boyfriend\u2019s washing line in 1986.\n\nI bought the jumpsuit in 1984 when I was 17. The photo of me wearing it was taken by my neighbour who had a crush on me and said he wanted to take some \u2018model shots\u2019! It was satisfying when Lilly went from mocking my clothes to wearing them. But I\u2019m happy to see her in them \u2013 it reminds me of my youth.\n\nNOW Alex wears the dress to parties all year round. THEN Christa wearing the Leonard dress in 1979\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve loved Mum\u2019s silk maxidress since I was four\u2019\n\nAlex Nelke, 39, a company director from London, owns most of her mum Christa\u2019s 1960s and 70s wardrobe, including a designer orchid-print evening dress.\n\nAlex I vividly remember my mum walking down the stairs in the most stunning silk orchid-print maxidress (above right), a fur bolero and high heels. I was in my pyjamas, and she was on her way to see The Magic Flute with my father. I thought she looked like a princess. I was four at the time and said there and then that I wanted the dress to be mine one day. I had to wait a couple of decades for it.\n\nMum, now 72, is very sentimental about her dresses, particularly the ones my father bought for her. He has now passed away, so they hold fond memories. He had exquisite taste and, while Mum would happily have worn jeans and T-shirts, Dad liked to take her shopping for designer dresses, jackets and handmade knee-high boots. I \u2018borrowed\u2019 the orchid dress when I was 22, and it somehow never found its way back into her wardrobe. I\u2019m the same dress and shoe size as Mum, so she\u2019s slowly given me the majority of her wardrobe from the 60s and 70s, including dresses and handbags. My sister Daniela can\u2019t fit into them \u2013 luckily for me!\n\nI always get lots of compliments when I wear the orchid dress. The print is so unusual, and I\u2019ve worn it to everything from my best friend\u2019s engagement to a launch party hosted by my company Marmalade PR. It works for summer with pumps, or in winter with a biker jacket. Mum looked more glamorous wearing it with fur and jewellery. It\u2019s the most amazing item I own.\n\nChrista It was love at first sight when my husband and I found this dress in a boutique in Hanover (where we lived). It was 1970 and I needed an outfit for a society ball. There were two of these dresses in stock, made by French designer Leonard, so the shop manager promised she wouldn\u2019t sell the other one until after the ball, to avoid me meeting someone wearing the same outfit. I wore it several times after that, including my 30th birthday party and the opera that Alex remembers. I hadn\u2019t worn it in 20 years when I let Alex have it. She loves it as much as I did, and I\u2019m proud of how good she looks in it.\n\nNOW Kathy wears her dad's flares. THEN James in the velvet suit at his wedding in 1972\n\n\u2018Dad\u2019s 70s velvet wedding flares are my favourite find\u2019\n\nKathy Stevenson, 33, a vintage fashion trader from London, doesn\u2019t just wear her mum\u2019s hand-me-downs, she also wears her dad James\u2019s.\n\nKathy Growing up in rural Devon meant I missed out on the latest fashions because the shops were so limited \u2013 instead, I bought my clothes from boot sales. Like my mum, I was drawn to patterns, probably because they stood out among the jumble. My parents moved house a lot so they didn\u2019t keep old clothes unless they held special memories. I have a couple of floaty 70s dresses, but one of my favourite finds is my dad\u2019s velvet flared wedding suit. I unearthed it when I was 15 because I wanted the jacket (very fashionable in the 90s), but in the past few years I\u2019ve worn the trousers more. When he got married in 1972 my dad (now 64) was so thin he had a 28-inch waist. The trousers are a bit big for me, but fine with a belt. I love how they elongate my legs. They\u2019re midnight blue and look great with a lace-trim cotton blouse and heels.\n\nVisit Kathy\u2019s shop 5678 Vintage at etsy.com or at So Vintage London events, Old Spitalfields Market\n\nJames When Jenny and I got married in 1972 my suit had to be velvet. We were final-year students at Manchester University and it was the time of Led Zeppelin \u2013 everyone was wearing flares. I felt like the cat\u2019s pyjamas on our big day. The suit served me well over the years at other weddings and posh dos. Sadly, I can no longer get into the trousers as I have a 34-inch waist, but they look super on my daughter. She has so much more style than me.\n\nNOW Mia in her granny's wedding dress. THEN Miriam in the full-length gown on her wedding day in 1955\n\n\u2018Three generations of women in my family have worn this dress\u2019\n\nMia Hadrill from London, a 24-year-old press officer for People Tree, chooses heritage finds over high street every time, including her grandmother Miriam\u2019s 1950s wedding gown.\n\nMia I\u2019ve been dipping into my mum\u2019s wardrobe since I was 16 because for every \u2018new\u2019 trend, there\u2019d be an authentic piece of hers from the 1970s or 80s that nailed the look, from denim shirts to silver lam\u00e9 dresses. My parents, both aid workers, have instilled in me the idea of fashion with a conscience. I haven\u2019t worn anything from the high street in years, preferring second-hand or fair-trade items.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until I hit my 20s that I began to wear my Granny Miriam\u2019s beautiful 1950s dresses that she\u2019d given my mum. I needed to develop into them, physically and emotionally, because they are all about celebrating the female body which requires confidence.\n\nOne of my favourites is the beautiful cream satin gown (above) that was once Granny\u2019s wedding dress. It was full-length, but my grandmother altered it into a cocktail dress in the 60s to wear to a ball with my grandfather. I remember seeing Mum in it when I was 11 and thinking she looked like an angel. I got my hands on it earlier this year, and had the bust taken in \u2013 now it won\u2019t fit Mum!\n\nI wore it to a Cambridge University May ball and the skirt was perfect for swirling in. The knowledge that two women who shaped me have worn the dress at a similar age felt very empowering. I also treasure a gold diamond brooch that my grandma gave me that\u2019s been in our family since 1865. It once belonged to my great-great-grandmother Mary Ann, who died falling off a bicycle. Her photo hangs on Granny Miriam\u2019s staircase \u2013 she looks so fierce, I\u2019m terrified of losing her brooch! But I wear it every day because it\u2019s so versatile \u2013 it can be threaded on to a pendant or choker. It makes Granny, who\u2019s 87, happy to see me using her things, so I email photos of my outfits to her iPad.\n\nMiriam The dress was a Vogue pattern originally made by a local dressmaker for my wedding in 1955. I felt thrilled to be dressed in so much silk after the scarcity of material a decade earlier. It took me around three hours to alter it in the 60s. Lots of women re-used wedding dresses back then. It\u2019s lovely to see my granddaughter wearing it, and I\u2019m amazed that almost 60 years after its first outing, it\u2019s still being worn to balls.\n\nNOW Tash gives the metallic dress a new lease of life. THEN Morag on her wedding day in 1980\n\n\u2018I rescued Mum\u2019s metallic slip from the jumble\u2019\n\nTash Ladlow, 31, a research director from London, wears her mum Morag\u2019s 80s wedding dress to other people\u2019s big days.\n\nTash I was horrified when my mum said she was going to throw away her wedding dress. Mum and Dad got married in Mauritius in 1980, and the pictures of mum with orchids in her permed hair wearing a metallic cocktail slip and strappy sandals are breathtaking. She thought I wouldn\u2019t want it because of a stain on the front, but I could see its potential as a cool party dress (and bicarbonate of soda got rid of the mark). Mum has a love of distinctive one-off pieces: I have her 80s sequined jacket in peacock colours that looks like something Elton John might have worn!\n\nThe first time I wore the dress was to a close friend\u2019s wedding. Telling her, \u2018I\u2019m wearing a wedding dress to your wedding,\u2019 was met with a horrified expression \u2013 until she saw it, as it doesn\u2019t look like one at all. I felt like a million dollars because it fits like a glove, but I made it look more edgy with a Zara necklace and stilettos.\n\nMy parents celebrated their 30th anniversary five years ago, so I feel the dress symbolises their life together. I\u2019ve worn it several times and it\u2019s always a conversation starter. My own wedding gown (I was married in 2011) was a traditional lace fishtail style: I wish I\u2019d gone for something a bit different like Mum did, that I could wear again.\n\nMorag I spotted the dress in a tiny boutique in Penarth, Glamorgan, when shopping with my mum a couple of days before my wedding in 1980. It was all very last minute \u2013 my husband and I were very alternative like that \u2013 and it was the first dress I tried on. It cost \u00a350, quite a lot back then. I also wore it to my cousin\u2019s wedding a couple of years later, but spilt mayonnaise down the front, so it was relegated to a jumble bag for years. It\u2019s thrilling that Tash has salvaged it from a crumpled heap. She looks more chic than I did.\n\nNOW Clare gives the mini a new spin. THEN Jan wears the original dress in 1972\n\n\u2018I have my mother-in-law\u2019s 70s minidress on permanent loan\u2019\n\nClare Winterson, 41, a seamstress from Hove, East Sussex, has given her mother-in-law Jan\u2019s handmade floral-print frock a second lease of life.\n\nClare When my mother-in-law mentioned that she\u2019d kept a few of her dresses from the 1960s and 70s I couldn\u2019t wait to get my hands on them. Jan was quite precious about her dresses at first\u2013 probably because she\u2019d made them herself. But I finally persuaded her to let me borrow a cute minidress with a ditsy floral print for a friend\u2019s 30th party and I never gave it back! I\u2019m a size bigger than she was, so I let out the darts.\n\nOur mutual love of fashion and sewing has strengthened our friendship. Jan looks out for vintage clothes and lamps for me (I make bespoke lampshades, lamplady.co.uk). Just after Rob and I got married she taught me to crochet; and now she\u2019s teaching my six-year-old daughter Esme to knit. I\u2019m keeping my clothes for Esme when she\u2019s older. Jan still asks if the dress is OK. And it is \u2013 I wear it in winter because it\u2019s made of thick cotton and the teals and browns work well with coloured tights and brogues.", "article_metadata": {"Rating": "General", "news_keywords": "i,owe,glam,mama,savvy,stylistas,reworking,families,old,clothes", "original-source": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/you/article-2786859/i-owe-glam-mama-savvy-stylistas-reworking-families-old-clothes.html", "doc-class": "Living Document", "twitter": {"description": "Meet the women who nail the hottest trends wearing vintage treasures passed down by Mum, Gran \u2013 and even Dad.", "title": "The savvy stylistas reworking their families' old clothes", "url": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/you/article-2786859/i-owe-glam-mama-savvy-stylistas-reworking-families-old-clothes.html", "app": {"id": {"ipad": 400442503, "iphone": 384101264}}, "image": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/10/10/1412953389136_wps_7_Glam_PUFF_jpg.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "account_id": 15438913}, "robots": "noodp,noydir,all,noarchive", "al": {"android": {"url": "dailymail-fb://article/2786859/", "app_name": "Daily Mail Online", "package": "com.dailymail.online"}, "ios": {"url": "dailymail-fb://article/2786859/", "app_store_id": 384101264, "app_name": "MailOnline"}}, "msvalidate.01": "12E6B4B813EB44C9BFC8F6A21F1D01F5", "fb": {"app_id": 146202712090395}, "MSSmartTagsPreventParsing": "true", "articleid": 2786859, "divclasspage": "articlePage", "keywords": "i,owe,glam,mama,savvy,stylistas,reworking,families,old,clothes", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/DailyMail", "published_time": "2014-10-11T23:34:00.000Zyyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss z", "author": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/search.html?s=&authornamef=Ruth+Tierney+For+You", "section": "You mag", "modified_time": "2014-10-11T23:34:00.000Zyyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss z", "tag": "i owe glam mama savvy stylistas reworking families old clothes"}, "verify-v1": "DXwlrsxbqxSv+FTFkWUfgflBvFJfx2YbNf/HmABrVyY=", "y_key": "1a7e912afbfcab2f", "og": {"site_name": "Mail Online", "description": "Meet the women who nail the hottest trends wearing vintage treasures passed down by Mum, Gran \u2013 and even Dad.", "title": "The savvy stylistas reworking their families' old clothes", "url": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/you/article-2786859/i-owe-glam-mama-savvy-stylistas-reworking-families-old-clothes.html", "image": {"width": 636, "identifier": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/10/10/1412953389136_wps_7_Glam_PUFF_jpg.jpg", "height": 382}, "video": {"width": 636, "identifier": "http://video.dailymail.co.uk/video/1418450360/2014/10/1418450360_3834432957001_How-to-Shop-at-a-Thrift-Store.mp4", "type": "video/mp4", "height": 358}, "type": "article"}, "channel": "Lifestyle,Culture,You", "description": "Meet the women who nail the hottest trends wearing vintage treasures passed down by Mum, Gran \u2013 and even Dad."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2f05\"", "article_summary": "I wore it with a distressed top, then found a photo of Mum wearing it with a similar ripped T-shirt.\nI\u2019ve worn it twice \u2013 with Swedish Hasbeens in summer, and thick tights and ankle boots in winter.\nOne of my favourites is the beautiful cream satin gown (above) that was once Granny\u2019s wedding dress.\nThe print is so unusual, and I\u2019ve worn it to everything from my best friend\u2019s engagement to a launch party hosted by my company Marmalade PR.\nTelling her, \u2018I\u2019m wearing a wedding dress to your wedding,\u2019 was met with a horrified expression \u2013 until she saw it, as it doesn\u2019t look like one at all."}
