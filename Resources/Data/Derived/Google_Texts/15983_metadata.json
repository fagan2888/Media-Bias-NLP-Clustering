Several members of the Freedom Caucus, the conservative group which led the revolt against Boehner\u2019s leadership, said they will now support the spending bill without demands that it include language to cut off funding for Planned Parenthood.\n\nSo no deal with the evil Nancy Pelosi was necessary. Imagine that. I guess we'll have to wait and see about the cushy K Street job, though.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "Mother Jones Magazine", "og": {"url": "http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2015/09/boehner-resigns-cruz-explodes-shutdown-averted", "site_name": "Mother Jones", "image": "/sites/all/assets/mojo_nomaster.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Boehner resigns, Cruz explodes, shutdown averted"}, "twitter": {"title": "Boehner resigns, Cruz explodes, shutdown averted", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2015/09/boehner-resigns-cruz-explodes-shutdown-averted", "image": {"src": "/sites/all/assets/mojo_nomaster.jpg", "identifier": "/sites/all/assets/mojo_nomaster.jpg"}, "creator": "kdrum", "site": "@MotherJones", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-310x150.png", "fb": {"admins": "13301307,670317733,1198876232,38509772,106892,2907757,306289,602422192,4101301,513450539"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-144x144.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-150x150.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca2c0\"", "article_summary": "I guess we'll have to wait and see about the cushy K Street job, though.\nSo no deal with the evil Nancy Pelosi was necessary.\nUnsurprisingly, this isn't true:Following Boehner\u2019s announcement, House Republicans said there was agreement to pass a clean spending bill to keep the government open.\nSeveral members of the Freedom Caucus, the conservative group which led the revolt against Boehner\u2019s leadership, said they will now support the spending bill without demands that it include language to cut off funding for Planned Parenthood.\nImagine that."}
