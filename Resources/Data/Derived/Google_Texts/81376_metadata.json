She said it\u2019s not unusual to hit the $10,000 out-of-pocket maximum in copay expenses in six months.\n\nThe Crystal Lake resident said her son has to take six medications three times a day and she hit her premium in the first month of the year after a 90-day supply for one of the medications cost her $2,000.\n\n\u201cPeople say why don\u2019t you just switch medications, but you can\u2019t do that once you find something that can control the seizures,\u201d Allan said, noting her son can have multiple episodes a day. \u201cThe prices are out of control and that\u2019s not even counting the premium.\u201d\n\nThe days of mortgage-like payments for medication could be over for the family and those in similar circumstances if one of two pending bills in Springfield are approved.\n\nOne proposal in the state Senate would limit out-of-pocket costs for specialty drugs to $100 a prescription or $200 a month a person for all medications in Illinois. The House proposal also would limit costs for specialty drugs to $100 a prescription a month but also cap the annual out-of-pocket maximum to 50 percent of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s annual out-of-pocket maximum.\n\nThe limit on out-of-pocket costs under the Affordable Care Act is $6,350 for an individual and $12,700 for a family. The proposals only apply to medication in the specialty tiers of the insurance plans and not the more common prescriptions under the standard three tiers.\n\nOpponents claim lowering the copays for the specialty tier could cause premium increases across all tiers and increases to cost sharing in lower tiers. But a study by Avalere Health \u2013 a national healthcare solution think-tank \u2013 showed premiums would increase by roughly $3 and cost sharing would increase by less than a dollar in most tiers to offset the difference.\n\nMany states have adopted similar measures. Delaware, Louisiana and Maryland limit monthly out-of-pocket costs while New York prohibits the specialty drug tier that exists in Illinois. Main and Vermont limit annual out-of-pocket costs.\n\nOther states have pending legislation similar to Illinois\u2019, including California, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Michigan, Mississippi, Ohio and Virginia.\n\nAllan said she just hopes reform comes by the time her son will need to cover the costs of the medication to treat the seizures he could have for the rest of his life.", "article_metadata": {"copyright": "2016 Northwest Herald", "og": {"url": "http://www.nwherald.com/2014/10/31/crystal-lake-resident-hopes-to-cap-the-copay-on-high-price-specialty-drugs/aurbkn9/", "image": "http://www.nwherald.com/images/avatar-facebook.png", "site_name": "Northwest Herald", "description": "CRYSTAL LAKE \u2013 Lisa Allan is hoping there is a cure for the cost to cure.", "title": "Crystal Lake resident hopes to \u2018cap the copay\u2019 on high-price specialty drugs"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.nwherald.com/images/avatar-twitter.png", "title": "Crystal Lake resident hopes to \u2018cap the copay\u2019 on high-price specialty drugs", "description": "CRYSTAL LAKE \u2013 Lisa Allan is hoping there is a cure for the cost to cure.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@nwherald"}, "robots": "All", "revisit-after": "1 Days", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1071875123", "fb": {"pages": 13044672572}, "tout": {"article": {"id": "8d5ab33f-6b2c-476e-87d3-792df6339af3"}}, "keywords": "#crystallake, crystal lake, cap the copay,", "distribution": "Global", "viewport": "width=device-width, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdda48\"", "article_summary": "Main and Vermont limit annual out-of-pocket costs.\nThe House proposal also would limit costs for specialty drugs to $100 a prescription a month but also cap the annual out-of-pocket maximum to 50 percent of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s annual out-of-pocket maximum.\nDelaware, Louisiana and Maryland limit monthly out-of-pocket costs while New York prohibits the specialty drug tier that exists in Illinois.\nThe limit on out-of-pocket costs under the Affordable Care Act is $6,350 for an individual and $12,700 for a family.\nOne proposal in the state Senate would limit out-of-pocket costs for specialty drugs to $100 a prescription or $200 a month a person for all medications in Illinois."}
