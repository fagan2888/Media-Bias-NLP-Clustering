That would give leaders from both chambers about a week to hammer out a final version of the bill before they\u2019re scheduled to deliver the document to Gov. Matt Bevin on March 30.\n\nA week isn\u2019t much time to negotiate a final budget, which has to be approved by April 13 or Bevin would have to call a special legislative session. Each legislative day costs Kentucky taxpayers about $70,000.\n\nLast week, House Democrats approved a budget proposal similar to Bevin\u2019s, although it restored cuts the governor proposed to higher education and would immediately fund a gap in teacher pensions.\n\nRelated Story Kentucky Politics Distilled: Budget Race Begins\n\nThere have been few hints about what the Senate budget could look like. Leaders of the Republican-led chamber appear to be on board with Bevin\u2019s proposals.\n\nLast week, Senate President Robert Stivers wouldn\u2019t say what changes he hoped his chamber would make to the Republican governor\u2019s proposal.\n\n\u201cThere may be things in there that we do not like, there may be things we agree with,\u201d Stivers said. \u201cIt\u2019s really late, and we\u2019re going to have to do a lot of work.\u201d\n\nBut on Friday, Stivers gave a lengthy speech demanding House Democrats to explain why University of Louisville Hospital needs $10 million to cover indigent care over the biennium. Stivers said the appropriation was proof the Affordable Care Act doesn\u2019t work.\n\n\u201cIs it working?\u201d he said rhetorically. \u201cIf it is, then there\u2019s no need for that appropriation.\u201d\n\nThere are major differences between the Democratic-led House\u2019s version of the budget and Bevin\u2019s, but the differences could have been more stark.\n\nHouse budget writers left in most of Bevin\u2019s nearly across-the-board spending cuts but restored about $215 million in cuts the governor proposed to the state\u2019s higher education institutions.\n\nAlso, the House radically changed Bevin\u2019s fix for the pension systems \u2014 taking money he set aside for future payments and putting it directly into the teacher retirement system, which only has about 42 percent of the money it needs to make future payments.\n\nThe moves aren\u2019t without a political angle. House Democrats have only a six-seat majority in the chamber \u2014 the last in the South still controlled by Democrats. And although they were able to hold off the GOP wave sweeping across Kentucky in recent special elections, 91 out of 100 seats are in contention in November.\n\nThe House Democrats\u2019 budget gives them an opportunity to contrast support for higher education with Republicans\u2019 planned cuts. And it takes off the table a chief criticism of Democrats\u2019 previous attempts to fix the state\u2019s beleaguered pensions: their idea to borrow billions in funds to cover current gaps.\n\nEvery House Democrat supported the budget proposal, while all 47 Republicans in the chamber abstained from voting.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A week isn't much time to negotiate a final budget, which has to be approved by April 13 or Bevin would have to call a special legislative session.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "89.3 WFPL", "description": "A week isn't much time to negotiate a final budget, which has to be approved by April 13 or Bevin would have to call a special legislative session.", "title": "Pressure On As Kentucky Senate Prepares For Budget Vote This Week", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1920, "identifier": "http://wfpl.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/capitol-9182.jpg", "height": 1280}, "updated_time": "2016-03-21T10:03:28-04:00", "url": "http://wfpl.org/senate-vote-budget-week/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A week isn't much time to negotiate a final budget, which has to be approved by April 13 or Bevin would have to call a special legislative session.", "title": "Pressure On As Kentucky Senate Prepares For Budget Vote This Week", "image": "http://wfpl.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/capitol-9182.jpg", "creator": "@RylandKY", "site": "@WFPLNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100006229511236, "pages": 33077174555, "app_id": 1539400482939529}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wfpllouisville", "section": "Politics", "tag": "kentucky general assembly", "published_time": "2016-03-21T06:50:11-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-21T10:03:28-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "Related Story Kentucky Politics Distilled: Budget Race BeginsThere have been few hints about what the Senate budget could look like.\nThe House Democrats\u2019 budget gives them an opportunity to contrast support for higher education with Republicans\u2019 planned cuts.\nSenate President Robert Stivers said he wants his chamber to vote on a budget Tuesday or Wednesday.\nHouse Democrats have only a six-seat majority in the chamber \u2014 the last in the South still controlled by Democrats.\nLast week, House Democrats approved a budget proposal similar to Bevin\u2019s, although it restored cuts the governor proposed to higher education and would immediately fund a gap in teacher pensions."}
