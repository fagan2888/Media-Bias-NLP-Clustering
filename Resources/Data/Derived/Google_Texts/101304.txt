ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. — A federal report says eligible New Mexicans paid an average of $127 a month after tax credits for Affordable Care Act marketplace plans in 2016.

The report, which was released Tuesday, “debunks the myth” that Obamacare consumers experienced whopping premium increases in the health insurance marketplace this year, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services asserts.

“Our analysis highlights how different the premiums that people actually pay are from the rates that are initially proposed by issuers,” Richard Frank, HHS assistant secretary for planning and evaluation said in a statement.

“Consumers’ actual health-insurance premiums depend on whether they shop around for the best deal and the availability of tax credits that lower premium costs, both of which changed the picture dramatically in 2016.”

HHS said 68 percent of the 55,000 New Mexicans who enrolled in a plan through the New Mexico Health Insurance Exchange BeWellNM qualified for a tax credit, which is based on income.

For 2016 coverage, 50 percent of customers in New Mexico had the option of selecting a plan with a premium of $75 or less per month after the tax credit, according to HHS.

Administration critics, such as Americans for Prosperity, said premiums are skyrocketing for other consumers and that the administration’s position ignores the true costs that taxpayers and others absorb.

The administration report was issued as insurers have begun filing their proposed rates for 2017 with state regulators, including New Mexico.

“While we expect competition to fluctuate from year-to-year, consumer choice remains strong, and four issuers are participating in the (New Mexico) marketplace,” the federal report stated. The insurers are Presbyterian Health Plan, New Mexico Health Connections, Christus Health Plan and Molina Healthcare of New Mexico.

Obamacare marketplace rates don’t affect the majority of New Mexicans who get insurance from employer plans or government programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. About 55,000 New Mexicans obtained insurance through the Obamacare marketplace in 2016.
