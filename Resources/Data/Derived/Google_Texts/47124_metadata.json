In the West, however, these beautifully colored chickens are popping up more in pet shops than in the butcher shop and are perhaps one of nature\u2019s most captivating examples of the otherwise common genetic mutation, hyperpigmentation.\n\nHyperpigmentation is a harmless condition that causes skin to become darker in color than the normal surrounding skin and is caused by an excess of melanin. In humans, hyperpigmentation commonly manifests in darker patches, but for the Silkie chicken, the hyperpigmentation further evolved into something called fibromelanosis. This causes nearly everything, aside from their plumes, to be black. \u201cSilkies look like creatures straight out of Dr. Seuss,\u201d Lissa Lucas from the chicken sales website, mypetchicken.com, explained, as reported by Modern Farmer.\n\nIn America, Silkies are commonly kept as pets.

This gives them a feel more similar to a fur coat than plumage. The Silkie's genetic mutation is believed to have originated in China, and it\u2019s here that the practice of eating the wu gu ji, mandarin for \u201cdark-boned chicken,\u201d has its roots.\n\nAccording to Chinese medicine, the black Silkie chicken can help to warm the body and strengthen the immune system. The chicken is believed to be especially helpful for women. According to Modern Farmer, eating a Silkie will help to increase female fertility, nourish a pregnant woman\u2019s developing child, and help to restore vitality in women who find they can\u2019t quite get in the mood after childbirth.\n\nIn the West, these chickens aren\u2019t used for food very often due to the cost it takes to raise them to maturity, and the tough, boney nature of their flesh. \u201cCommercial meat chickens are tender because they\u2019re young and have little space to exercise those muscles. \u201cTo raise Silkies for meat, it would cost way more in feed and time to produce a smaller, tougher bird,\u201d Lucas explained. Also, they lay far less eggs than the traditional chicken, with a single birth yielding about three small eggs each week.\n\nArguably, though, Westerners may be less inclined to eat these particular fowls due to their endearing appearance. Whether you are a bird person or not, there's no denying this chicken\u2019s beauty. Their soft, \u201csilky\u201d plumage, which unlike other chickens grows all the way down to their toes, makes the bird unable to fly. I\u2019m sure these little chicks aren\u2019t too worried about their mode of transportation, though, because once you pick one up, it\u2019ll be hard to put the fluffy bird down again.\n\nSilkies have black bones and skin, and nearly black flesh.
