Ed Buttrey, R-Great Falls, during the committee hearing on his Senate Bill 405 last week. \u201cI believe the solution is in your hands.\u201d\n\nHe dubbed it the Health and Economic Livelihood Partnership Act, HELP for short. The bill, which accepts federal money available under the Affordable Care Act and includes programs that attempt to get people out of poverty, might be the one that has the best chance to expand Medicaid in Montana. Three other Republican-sponsored Medicaid bills died on the House floor last week, thanks in part to several Republicans themselves.\n\nButtrey smiled confidently as he watched dozens of supporters speak. Turnout wasn\u2019t as big for this hearing as for Governor Steve Bullock\u2019s Medicaid expansion bill earlier this month. After that proposal died, he and some Senate Democrats have thrown their support behind Buttrey.\n\nButtrey also brings a group of moderate Republicans along, or maybe they bring him along.\n\nThe tale of a 3rd grade engineer\n\nButtrey grew up in Great Falls, but hasn\u2019t spent his whole life there. He comes from the family that ran a chain of grocery stores in Montana, but his dad didn\u2019t want him to be a part of the family business. When Buttrey was in third grade, an astronaut who was also an electrical engineer visited his class.\n\n\u201cI came home that day and told my parents I wanted to be an electrical engineer and work at Boeing,\u201d Buttrey said.\n\nThat\u2019s pretty much what happened. Buttrey went to West Point for a bit but ended up at Montana State University studying electrical engineering and ultimately landing a job at Boeing.\n\nHe loved the work. He worked on weapons systems and with complicated problems.\n\n\u201cA lot of what I did was problem solving,\u201d Buttrey said. \u201cWhether it was dealing with stealth aircraft or new weapons, we were always trying to solve the impossible.\u201d\n\nThough it was his dream career, he found himself wanting to come back to Montana.\n\n\u201cLike most Montanans, I spent a lot of my life trying to get out of the state,\u201d Buttrey said, \u201cand then eventually decided I wanted to spend the rest of my life trying to get back to the state.\u201d\n\nIn the late 90s, he moved to Bigfork and launched Cable Technology, a manufacturing business that made electronics for aircraft, serving mostly \u201caerospace and military customers.\u201d He also became an assistant coach for the Bigfork High School football team, alongside Todd Emslie.\n\n\u201cHe jumped at the chance to come out and help,\u201d Emslie said. The pair worked together on the football field for six years until Emslie left the job in the mid-2000s.\n\nMeanwhile, Buttrey\u2019s company grew and he became more interested in labor and business law. He spoke at chamber of commerce events and business luncheons, and he was vocal about what he wanted to see changed in state government.\n\n\u201cAfter you talk about what you want to see changed, people start saying, 'well what are you going to do about it besides talking about what needs to be changed?'\u201d Buttrey said.\n\nPeople began urging him to run for the legislature, and Buttrey decided to give it a try.\n\nBy that time he\u2019d moved back to Great Falls to expand Cable Technology, and took over the family real estate company. He\u2019d also rejoined the Bigfork football coaching staff. Emslie had returned to the job after the team went four years without a win, and he convinced Buttrey to come back too. Even today, Buttrey still drives back and forth between Great Falls and Bigfork during football season.\n\n'You need somebody that\u2019s Ed-like'\n\nIn 2010, Buttrey ran for and won a Senate seat and served in his first legislative session in 2011.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always said who you align yourself with when you first enter into the legislature is the most important thing in your legislative career,\u201d Buttrey said in an interview early last week.\n\nHe was a little overwhelmed, but he found friends in the moderate faction of Republicans, like Sen. Llew Jones, R-Conrad. Jones and Buttrey are even business partners, co-investors in the Marina Cay Resort in Bigfork. Buttrey also bought the Bynum Bar with Jones\u2019 sons, who eventually sold their share to Choteau Republican Rep. Christy Clark\u2019s husband Lew Clark.\n\nThese partnerships further cemented Buttrey\u2019s place in the small, but influential moderate camp.\n\nJones emerged as the leader of the group of moderate Republicans during the 2013 session, that joined with Democrats to pass major legislation, like a school funding bill and pension reform.\n\nJones said that within that group, everyone had to be an expert on something for them to be effective. Someone needed to be an expert on education, campaign finance, the state employee retirement system \u2013 and somebody needed to be an expert on Medicaid.\n\n\u201cYou need somebody that\u2019s Ed-like,\u201d Jones said, adding that Buttrey\u2019s attention to detail and organization would help him there.\n\nOne day during the last session, Jones told Buttrey to come to a meeting and told him that he was going to be the Medicaid guy.\n\nAfter moves toward Medicaid expansion failed in 2013, Buttrey worked through the interim, looking for a solution to the riddle.\n\n\u201cEddie knows her down to the granular now,\u201d Jones said. \u201cThere\u2019s no better informed person on that topic today.\u201d\n\nHis solution\n\nThe product of that work is Senate Bill 405. The bill accepts federal money available under the Affordable Care Act \u2013 a point of contention for many Republicans \u2013 and expands coverage to people earning up to 138 percent of the poverty level.\n\nIt also asks recipients to pay small premiums for their Medicaid coverage and creates a program through the Department of Labor that\u2019s meant to help those on Medicaid get out of poverty and buy insurance on the federal exchange. It would include a workplace assessment survey and a job placement program.\n\nParts of the bill require waivers from the federal government, which Buttrey is confident will get approved, although the process could take several months after the bill is signed.\n\nIt\u2019s the third attempt this session to expand Medicaid. Gov. Bullock\u2019s plan to cover as many as 70,000 uninsured people died earlier this month. Measures from the more conservative sect of the GOP estimated to cover around 10,000 people failed last week.\n\nButtrey guesses his bill will cover around 45,000 people, but some supporters say it has the potential to cover the 70,000 in the so-called gap between eligibility for Medicaid and being able to afford to buy insurance on the exchange.\n\nAlong with Bullock, hospital and physician organizations are pleased. Senate Minority Leader Jon Sesso, D-Butte, said his party will also back Buttrey\u2019s plan.\n\n\u201cThe fact is that the bill fulfills a couple of the threshold criteria,\u201d Sesso said. Those criteria are the federal money and covering those earning up to 138 percent of poverty.\n\nSesso did say Democrats are uncomfortable with parts of the bill, like asking poor people to pay premiums for Medicaid coverage, but that it was a good compromise.\n\nNot all Republicans are ready to support the bill, though.\n\nSenate President Pro Tempore Eric Moore, R-Miles City, said he hasn\u2019t decided whether or not to support the bill, but sees potential concerns in its use of federal money and wants to see a plan in case the federal money runs out.\n\nRep. Art Wittich, R-Bozeman, who chairs the House Human Services Committee that voted down the governor\u2019s bill to expand Medicaid, sees no positives in the bill.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s awful,\u201d Wittich said. \u201cIt\u2019s worse than the governor\u2019s bill.\u201d\n\nHe said that it expands government too far by creating the work program under the Department of Labor. Government sponsored work programs have never worked, Wittich said.\n\nGeorge Paul, the chair of the Cascade County Republican Central Committee, which is in Buttrey\u2019s district, said it appears to be another step away from the conservative Republicans for Buttrey.\n\nThat party committee is an example of how the well-known split in the Republican party even manifests itself on a local level. Since last summer, when Paul became chair of the committee, Buttrey and a few other moderate Great Falls Republicans, like Rep. Steve Fitzpatrick,have distanced themselves from the central committee.\n\nThe central committee recently censured Fitzpatrick, who has a bill that would gut the Republican lawsuit to close Montana\u2019s primary elections. Paul doesn\u2019t have a censure for Buttrey, but he said his work on Medicaid makes him, like Fitzpatrick, a \u201cRepublican-in-name-only,\u201d or RINO.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re looking pretty much like they would fit that description,\u201d Paul said. \u201cIn general, the party doesn\u2019t support the Medicaid expansion\u201d available under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nButtrey said his work as a Senator isn\u2019t about following the party line wherever it leads, but about finding solutions. His work on Medicaid shows that.\n\nOn his campaign website for the 2014 election, he said he would support the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, but also makes the concession that it is law and pledges to work within the law to find a solution.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the easiest thing in the world for a legislator to do to spout rhetoric and vote no on everything,\u201d Buttrey said. \u201cYou're popular, you can defend your positions, but do you get anything done?\u201d", "article_metadata": {"category": "Montana News", "description": "Middle ground on Medicaid expansion eluded the Montana Legislature in 2013, and since then Senator Ed Buttrey, R-Great Falls, has studied the issue, talked", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://mtpr.org/post/senator-buttrey-medicaid-expansion-riddle-and-risk", "image": "http://mtpr.org/sites/kufm/files/styles/medium/public/201503/Ed-Buttrey-%28mtleg%29.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Middle ground on Medicaid expansion eluded the Montana Legislature in 2013, and since then Senator Ed Buttrey, R-Great Falls, has studied the issue, talked", "title": "For Senator Buttrey, Medicaid Expansion Is A Riddle And A Risk"}, "org_id": 0, "twitter": {"site": "@mtpublicradio", "card": "summary"}, "author": "Michael Wright - Community News Service", "wordCount": 1807, "dc": {"title": "For Senator Buttrey, Medicaid Expansion Is A Riddle And A Risk"}, "nid": 32530, "datePublished": "2015-03-25", "story_id": 395404495, "keywords": "Montana Legislature, Ed Buttrey, Medicaid expansion, Senate Bill 405, Montana HELP Act, Affordable Care Act, health insurance, Great Falls Montana, Bigfork Montana, Llew Jones, Marina Cay Resort, Bynum Bar, Responsible Republicans, Steve Bullock, Jon Sesso, Eric Moore, Art Wittich, George Paul, Cascade County Republican Central Committee, Steve Fitzpatrick", "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd229d\"", "article_summary": "After moves toward Medicaid expansion failed in 2013, Buttrey worked through the interim, looking for a solution to the riddle.\n\u201cThis is a riddle we\u2019ve been trying to solve,\u201d said Sen.
