SAVANNAH, Ga. - A Georgia man faces returning to prison after pleading guilty a second time to stealing the eggs of protected sea turtles.



Lewis Jackson is scheduled for sentencing Wednesday by a federal judge after he pleaded guilty to swiping 84 eggs from a loggerhead sea turtle nest on Sapelo Island.

Mark Dodd of the Georgia Department of Natural Resources says Jackson confessed to selling turtle eggs for people to consume at parties. He says the practice is fueled by folklore that the eggs improve sexual performance.

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the nonprofit Sea Turtle Conservancy say turtle egg thefts are rare in the U.S.

Jackson spent six months in prison for a prior egg theft in 2012. His attorney, James Yancey Jr., did not return calls seeking comment.
