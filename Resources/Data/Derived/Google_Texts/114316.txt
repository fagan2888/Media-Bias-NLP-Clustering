VATICAN CITY (AP) — Pope Francis is calling for Latin America to care for its poorest and most marginalized, those who have been “enslaved” and exploited by an economic system that he said treats them as useless.

Francis deviated from his homily on an important Latin American feast day Friday to hammer home a point he made for years as archbishop of Buenos Aires and now as pope.

The Argentine Jesuit said he prayed that the continent would be shaped in the future by attention the poor and persecuted, “by those for whom today the idolatry of a culture of waste relegates them to a category of slaves, objects of exploitation or simply wasted.”

He said he hoped the continent’s future would balance justice with reconciliation, scientific development with human wisdom and suffering with hope.

The feast of Our Lady of Guadalupe is one of the region’s most important holidays. Millions of people make the pilgrimage to a Mexican basilica to honor the dark-skinned virgin who is said to have appeared to an Indian peasant on Dec. 12, 1531.
