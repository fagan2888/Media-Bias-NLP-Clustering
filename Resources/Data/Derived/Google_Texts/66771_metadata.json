The abolitionist political party was the party of Lincoln \u2014 the Republican Party. History shows the Democratic Party could not have passed the Civil/Voting Rights Acts without the help and votes of the majority of the Republican minority party.\n\nThe Democrats supported welfare programs that increased single-parent households. In the African-American community, single-parent households are now 70 percent.\n\nThe majority of the money collected by government designated for welfare programs goes to administrative costs.\n\nThe reverse is true for most ministries.\n\nJesus was neither liberal or conservative.\n\nYou will find in Proverbs, spoken twice \u2014 \u201cDo not be a surety for your neighbor.\u201d\n\nI do not want to support the lifestyles of individuals who continue in risky behavior. I also do not want to pay for the killing of unborn children, since they are made in the image of God. These actions are supported in the Affordable Care Act. Jesus forgave the prostitute, but said to not continue in risky behavior (sin) \u2014 and he certainly never condoned infanticide.\n\nConservatives do not like governmental waste \u2014 Jesus was definitely not wasteful. He even collected the scraps left behind by the multitude.\n\nJesus received financial benefit from the wives of the rich. Rich or poor, conservative or liberal; Jesus is the savior of whosoever accepts his sacrifice on the cross \u2014 and him into their hearts.\n\nDexter L.
