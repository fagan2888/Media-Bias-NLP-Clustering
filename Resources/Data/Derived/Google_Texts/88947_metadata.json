Senate campaign\n\nEmail Newsletters Sign up for one of our email newsletters.\n\nWhat gives politics a bad name or an even worse name than it already had?\n\nAt least in this election cycle it's the Pennsylvania Senate Democratic Campaign Committee, its executive director, Joe Aronson, and Heather Arnet, of Mt. Lebanon, the Democrats' nominee to fill the 37th Senatorial District seat vacated by Matt Smith.\n\nA television ad by the committee, known as the PSDCC, and by \u201cHeather for Harrisburg,\u201d Ms. Arnet's campaign apparatus, claims flat out that Guy Reschenthaler, the Republican nominee of Jefferson Hills, \u201cwill cut Medicare and Social Security.\u201d\n\nThat, of course, would be a mighty feat for Mr. Reschenthaler, should he be elected to this state Senate seat.\n\n\u201cHow does THAT work?,\u201d I emailed Mr. Aronson last week. He responded in a telephone call that was so dissembling and so discombobulated as to be incoherent \u2014 denial in the round, if you will \u2014 and impossible to quote. It was Orwellian gobbledygook by design, rest assured.\n\nFirst, Aronson intimated that the Reschenthaler camp must have, all of a sudden, notified the media of a spot that had been running for three weeks. No one from Reschenthaler's campaign contacted me.\n\nThen, Aronson tried to defend the ad's assertion by noting, in true political non sequiturial fashion, that it came essentially from Reschenthaler's own words, taken from the audio, used in the commercial, of a generalized remark about the unchecked and unsustainable growth of what indeed is the entitlement state.\n\nBut, \u201cHow can Guy Reschenthaler cut Medicare and Social Security?,\u201d I asked Aronson, repeatedly.\n\nCue the hack of a flack who can't defend the use of an impossibility to smear the opposition in pursuit of scaring senior citizens. Aronson couldn't give a straight answer. And he likely wouldn't do it even if you skewered him on a spit and tried to slow-roast it out of him.\n\nAronson's four-flushing then turned to affectatious bumfuzzling. That Reschenthaler couldn't cut Medicare and Social Security, a fact, and that the ad was deceitful, another fact, was my \u201copinion,\u201d he kept saying.\n\nPolitics as usual? Some will argue that. But that makes them as dishonorable and dishonest as Aronson and Arnet.\n\nMs. Arnet did not respond to two requests to her campaign website for a comment.\n\nBy the way, if Reschenthaler made the same kind of ludicrous allegations \u2014 say, \u201cHeather Arnet will raise your Medicare and Social Security taxes!\u201d \u2014 this column would disembowel him, his campaign and his surrogates just the same.\n\nThe Heather Arnet ad is not \u201cpolitics as usual.\u201d It is lying. And it is a prevarication to scare a specifically targeted cohort of the electorate \u2014 the aged, the infirm, the disabled, the retired on fixed incomes \u2014 who might believe that Reschenthaler would do what he can't possibly do.\n\nThus, the Arnet ad preys on a vulnerable population. That's despicable and a sign of a poltroonish party and an equally cowardly candidate prepared to do and say anything to win. And that fact should not be lost on voters on Nov. 3.\n\nIf this is how Heather Arnet acts in a campaign, how will she act in the Pennsylvania Senate? A discerning electorate already has its answer.\n\nColin McNickle is Trib Total Media's director of editorial pages (412-320-7836 or cmcnickle@tribweb.com).", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Colin McNickle", "description": "What gives politics a bad name or an even worse name than it already had At least in this election cycle it's the Pennsylvania Senate ...", "pubdate": "2015-10-10 23:51:01", "author": "Colin McNickle", "og": {"site_name": "TribLIVE.com", "description": "What gives politics a bad name or an even worse name than it already had At least in this election cycle it's the Pennsylvania Senate ...", "title": "The lie that defines Heather Arnet's Pa.
