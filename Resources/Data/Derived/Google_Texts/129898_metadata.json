As originally designed, once Part D beneficiaries reached their (relatively low) deductible, they had to pay 25 percent of their drug costs up to a certain dollar amount; once beneficiaries\u2019 drug costs reached that limit, they then had to pay all of their drug costs. Then, if their total out-of-pocket costs reached an even higher level (called the catastrophic coverage limit, which is currently set at $4,750), then they only had to pay 5 percent of drug costs above that limit.\n\nBy the year 2020, though, there will no longer be a donut hole. From the moment beneficiaries\u2019 drug costs reach their deductibles until they reach the catastrophic coverage limit, they will only pay 25 percent of their total drug costs.\n\nWhile it does appear to be true that Part D beneficiaries who are in the coverage gap will start saving money thanks to Obamacare, there are several caveats to this analysis.\n\nFirst, under Obamacare, higher-income taxpayers pay higher Medicare taxes and higher premiums on Part B and Part D coverage. Medicare Part D was the first federal entitlement to be specifically means-tested. At the time, many Democrats objected to this aspect of the law, since broad-based support for entitlements relies on the universality of their costs and benefits. Democrats are now, ironically, making Part D even more progressive, but these changes will cancel out some of the savings their law provides in Part D. Meanwhile, Medicare beneficiaries with lower incomes (up to 150 percent of the federal poverty line) have already been eligible for subsidies on their out-of-pocket drug costs.\n\nSecond, Obamacare will raise the costs for Part D providers, who will likely pass the costs onto beneficiaries in the form of higher premiums. The coverage gap encouraged beneficiaries to keep their drug costs low, since they would be ultimately responsible for a lot of excess costs. There is much evidence to suggest that the increase in health-care cost-sharing is responsible for slowdown in health-care inflation over the past few years. Part D premiums especially have remained lower than projections, and though there are debates as to why that\u2019s been the case, at least part of the reason has to do with the program\u2019s cost-sharing measures, namely the \u201cdonut hole.\u201d Now that Obamacare has gotten rid of these measures, the likely result is that Part D premiums will increase.\n\nThe Obama administration is happy to tout the drop in customers\u2019 costs in the short run, but typically, they are ignoring the unintended consequences and hidden costs of their preferred policies.", "article_metadata": {"tweettext": "Why Obamacare's Closing the Donut-Hole Isn't All It's Cracked Up to Be", "sailthru.author": "Noah Glyn", "description": "The White House is pushing a\u00a0recently published CMS report that purports to show a new\u00a0benefit of Obamacare \u2014 it\u2019s closing the dreaded Medicare \u201cdonut hole.\u201d A senior administration official quoted\u00a0in Politico\u2019s Playbook says that Obamacare \u201chas helped more than 7.3 million seniors and people with disabilities who reached the donut hole in their Medicare Part D plans save $8.9 billion on their prescription drug costs nationwide \u2014 or an average of $1,209 in savings per person.\u201d There\u2019s some truth to this boast, but as usual, there\u2019s more to it than\u00a0meets the eye.\u00a0\n\nOver time, Obamacare\u00a0closes the coverage gap, informally referred to as the donut hole, in Medicare\u2019s prescription-drug program (Part D).\u00a0As originally designed, once Part D beneficiaries reached their (relatively low)\u00a0deductible, they had to pay 25 percent of their drug costs up to a certain dollar amount;\u00a0once beneficiaries\u2019 drug costs reached that limit, they then had to pay all of their drug costs.
