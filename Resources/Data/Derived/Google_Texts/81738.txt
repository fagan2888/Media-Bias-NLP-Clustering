How do you feel about U.S. health care reform?

Two journalists with backgrounds covering health care and opposing views on the subject will let you know their thoughts during March 17 debate.

Avik Roy, opinion editor of Forbes, and Jonathan Cohn, an editor of the New Republic, will debate the viability of the Affordable Care Act at the U-M Ford School of Public Policy.

Roy is a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute and former health policy adviser to 2012 presidential candidate Mitt Romney. He serves as principal author of The Apothecary, a Forbes blog on health care policy and entitlement reform, as a columnist for National Review Online and has authored "How Medicaid Fails the Poor."



Cohn, senior editor at the New Republic, is author of "Sick: The Untold Story of America's Health Care Crisisâ€”and the People Who Pay the Price" and has been recognized by The Washington Post as "one of the nation's leading experts on health care policy."
