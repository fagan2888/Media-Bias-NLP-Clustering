Norfolk, Va. – Service members will now be required to submit a new form with their taxes this year.

The new form, the 1095-C, proves service personnel are covered under the healthcare requirements of the Affordable Care Act (otherwise known as Obamacare).

Service members must keep their 1095-C with their tax records. According to Army Lt. Col. Samuel W. Kan, the executive director of the Defense Department’s Armed Forces Tax Council, service members who entered or left the military in 2015 or had other life-changing circumstances that created a health care coverage lapse have an issue that must be addressed with a tax preparer.

Taxpayers without minimum essential health care can incur IRS penalties, Kan said.
