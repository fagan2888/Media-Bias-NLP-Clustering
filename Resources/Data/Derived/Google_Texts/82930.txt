Bill Maher and MSNBC did not have a very romantic Valentine’s Day: The comedian “broke up” with the left-leaning network for its incessant coverage of Chris Christie and the controversy surrounding his administration’s role in closing the George Washington Bridge last year. To make the situation even more awkward, Maher will welcome Rachel Maddow, the biggest perpetuator of Bridgegate, on his show on Friday.

“Look, I’m no good at being noble, but it doesn’t take much to see that the problems of three little lanes of traffic don’t amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world,” he wrote on his blog over the weekend. More from Maher’s blog:

Whatever we had is not working any more. You’re obviously interested in another man: Chris Christie. You’re obsessed with him. So I wanted you to hear it from me first. I’m going to start seeing other news organizations. I’ll miss what we had. It was a rocket ship ride. We were both passionate flaming liberals and we didn’t care what the world thought of us. It was a glorious time. We finished each other’s Sarah Palin jokes. But now we never talk about any of the things we used to talk about: global warming, gun control, poverty… All because Chris Christie came along and put you under his spell.

Maher went on to say MSNBC has “stopped leaning forward,” and that it is mirroring Fox News’ coverage over Benghazi. “You’ll meet other viewers. It’s for the best. You can focus on your career. And we can still be friends,” he concluded. “We’ll always have Obamacare.”

Our own Charles C. W. Cooke will also be on the Real Time with Bill Maher panel on Friday night.
