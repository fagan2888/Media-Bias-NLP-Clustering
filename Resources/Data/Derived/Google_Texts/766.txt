Brendon McCullum's days as an international wicketkeeper for New Zealand are over.

Black Caps coach Mike Hesson says his captain's ongoing back injury means they can no longer risk calling on McCullum to wear the gloves in any form of the game.

The 32-year-old has been a wicketkeeper through most of his 12-year international career but has been eased out of the role in recent seasons - most notably at Test level where BJ Watling has proved a capable gloveman.

''He's too valuable a player for us to consider using him as a keeper,'' Hesson said.

McCullum kept wicket for 52 of his 81 Tests, 185 of 220 one-day internationals and 42 of 62 Twenty20 internationals. He played down speculation before the home series against the West Indies that he was considering retirement.

But he has clearly been in discomfort while batting in the first two Tests, constantly stretching his back between deliveries.

Hesson says McCullum's fitness is otherwise excellent and he can extend his career with careful ''maintenance'' work.

Resting the veteran from ODI or Twenty20 games is a possibility during the home summer against the West Indies and India.

''We'd only rest him if his back was at a point where he couldn't play. That could occur,'' Hesson said. ''But he still throws himself around the field and puts himself in compromising positions.''
