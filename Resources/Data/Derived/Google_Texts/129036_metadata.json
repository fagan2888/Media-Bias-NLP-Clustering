Aside from its casual homophobia and relentless references to drunkenness, there were also an unnerving number of disdainful references \u2013 and photographs \u2013 relating to her job as an E.R. technician.\n\nOver the course of her timeline \u2013 which, interestingly, was deleted Friday morning as I was reading through it \u2014 Knott revealed herself to be a woman with a propensity for sharing scenes from her job. \u201cWhy would you clean your gutters in the rain?\u201d she asked in one tweet, accompanied by an X-ray of a pelvis. \u201cGot to pop this back in,\u201d she bragged, regarding an X-ray of a dislocated finger. She shared images she described with, \u201cYa know when u put a hotdog in the microwave too long? That\u2019s what his finger looked like,\u201d and in which she decided, \u201cKid had way too much fun at lacosta last night. Swallowed a pen spring.\u201d She admitted, \u201cIts sick i laughed at this\u201d [sic] over a story about an ambulance stolen with a patient inside, and confessed, \u201cI can handle blood and vomit I CAN\u2019T HANDLE when someone tells me they have fleas and bed bugs #disgusting #itchingfordayzzzz\u201d and \u201cthe locals of lansdale are gross come to the ER & see for urself.\u201d\n\nAfter a brief suspension, Knox has now been officially fired from her job at Lansdale Hospital-Abington Health. The facility has also announced an investigation \u201crelated to this employee\u2019s Twitter account for potential violations of patient privacy and our organization\u2019s social media policy.\u201d If that policy is similar to the posted one for Mass General, the one telling employees to \u201cbe aware that existing hospital policies apply, in particular, those pertaining to patient privacy,\u201d the violations should be pretty clear. But how did no one at Knox\u2019s job know what she was doing till now \u2014 and who at that hospital still is?", "article_metadata": {"description": "A beating suspect used social media to mock her patients -- but she's not the only one", "title": "Kathryn Knott proves how shaky your patient privacy is", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "A beating suspect used social media to mock her patients -- but she's not the only one", "title": "Kathryn Knott proves how shaky your patient privacy is", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/09/26/kathryn_knott_proves_how_shaky_your_patient_privacy_is/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/kathryn_knott.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A beating suspect used social media to mock her patients -- but she's not the only one", "title": "Kathryn Knott proves how shaky your patient privacy is", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/kathryn_knott.jpg", "creator": "@embeedub", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Mary Elizabeth Williams", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, healthcare, Kathryn Knott, LGBT, online privacy, Philadelphia, Privacy, Social Media", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: healthcare, Kathryn Knott, LGBT, online privacy, Philadelphia, Privacy, Social Media, Life NewsWhen Kathryn Knott turned herself in to Philadelphia authorities earlier this week in connection with the brutal beating of two gay men, it didn\u2019t take long for her social media trail to attract widespread attention.\nBut how did no one at Knox\u2019s job know what she was doing till now \u2014 and who at that hospital still is?\nThe facility has also announced an investigation \u201crelated to this employee\u2019s Twitter account for potential violations of patient privacy and our organization\u2019s social media policy.\u201d If that policy is similar to the posted one for Mass General, the one telling employees to \u201cbe aware that existing hospital policies apply, in particular, those pertaining to patient privacy,\u201d the violations should be pretty clear.\n\u201cWhy would you clean your gutters in the rain?\u201d she asked in one tweet, accompanied by an X-ray of a pelvis.\nThat\u2019s what his finger looked like,\u201d and in which she decided, \u201cKid had way too much fun at lacosta last night."}
