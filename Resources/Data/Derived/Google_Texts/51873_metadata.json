It\u2019s an event designed for fans, allowing them to interact with the mushers, take photos and pet the dogs.\n\nThe \u201cceremonial start is honestly the most fun day because you really get to show everyone, I mean, all of Anchorage and then plus everyone whose come here, your sport. And you get to show it with passion, which is so cool,\u201d said Aliy Zirkle, a fan favorite who has four top five finishes in the last four Iditarods.\n\n\u201cSo running down Forth Avenue, 12 dogs, someone in your sled, it\u2019s fun and it should be fun,\u201d she said.\n\nThe ceremonial start in Anchorage went forward despite a lack of snow in Alaska\u2019s largest city this winter. Snow even had to be shipped this week to Anchorage from Fairbanks for the event. After all that, it snowed about an inch Friday.\n\nJanet Zoellick of Anchorage was so excited for the ceremonial start, she dragged her boyfriend out of bed at 6:30 a.m. so they could get moving early.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018C\u2019mon we got to get down there early. I want to get parking, I want to be in on the action, I want to meet all the mushers, I got to take pictures, I got to wish them luck,\u201d said Zoellick.\n\nShe is a Chicago native who visited Anchorage for the ceremonial start in 2012.\n\n\u201cI fell in love with it, and I knew this was the land for me,\u201d she said. Two years later, she moved to Anchorage \u201cfor good.\u201d\n\nThe ceremonial start usually covers an 11-mile (17.7-kilometer) route, going along city streets and trails from downtown Anchorage to the east side of the city.\n\nBut the lack of snow forced organizers to shorten the race to a 3-mile (4.83-kilometer) route.\n\nThe competitive race, which spans nearly 1,000 miles (1,600 kilometers), starts Sunday in Willow, about 50 miles (80.46 kilometers) north of Anchorage. Organizers say trail conditions largely improve after Willow, but mushers are wary of the conditions.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Fans heading to Anchorage for Iditarod ceremonial start", "title": "Fans heading to Anchorage for Iditarod ceremonial start", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Fans heading to Anchorage for Iditarod ceremonial start", "title": "Fans heading to Anchorage for Iditarod ceremonial start", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/03/06/fans_heading_to_anchorage_for_iditarod_ceremonial_start/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/03/iditarod.jpeg3-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Fans heading to Anchorage for Iditarod ceremonial start", "title": "Fans heading to Anchorage for Iditarod ceremonial start", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/03/iditarod.jpeg3-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Mark Thiessen", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Thousands of people lined the route for the ceremonial start of the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race.\nThe ceremonial start in Anchorage went forward despite a lack of snow in Alaska\u2019s largest city this winter.\nShe is a Chicago native who visited Anchorage for the ceremonial start in 2012.\nTwo years later, she moved to Anchorage \u201cfor good.\u201dThe ceremonial start usually covers an 11-mile (17.7-kilometer) route, going along city streets and trails from downtown Anchorage to the east side of the city.\nJanet Zoellick of Anchorage was so excited for the ceremonial start, she dragged her boyfriend out of bed at 6:30 a.m. so they could get moving early."}
