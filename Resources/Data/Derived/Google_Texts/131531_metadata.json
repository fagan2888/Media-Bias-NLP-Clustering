It requires sensitivity to what that person wants to come from the disclosure. But here\u2019s a good first step: Don\u2019t make it about you and what you need.\n\nOn Monday, Beth Stelling, who has had a banner career year and who Vulture recently dubbed \u201ca young comedian to watch,\u201d posted a shocking image on Instagram. It was a quartet of photos: one of her smiling and holding a microphone, and three of her limbs, covered in bruises. \u201cSame girl in all of these photos (me),\u201d she wrote. \u201cI\u2019ve had an amazing year and you\u2019ve seen the highlights here, so these photos are an uncommon thing to share but not an uncommon issue\u2026. When I broke up with my ex this summer, it wasn\u2019t because I didn\u2019t love him, it was because of this. And I absolutely relapsed and contacted him with things I shouldn\u2019t have, but there are no \u2018best practices\u2019 with this. When friends or comics ask why we broke up it\u2019s not easy or comfortable to reply; it doesn\u2019t seem like the appropriate thing to say at a stand-up show, a party or a wedding. It\u2019s embarrassing. I feel stupid. After being verbally, physically abused and raped, I dated him for two more months. It\u2019s not simple.\u201d Stelling went on to state, \u201cAfter I broke up with him he said, \u2018You\u2019re very open and honest in your stand-up, and I just ask that you consider me when you talk about your ex because everyone knows who you\u2019re talking about.\u2019 And I abided. I wrote vague jokes because we both live in L.A. and I didn\u2019t want to hurt him, start a war, press charges, be interrogated or harassed by him or his friends and family. I wanted to move on and forget because I didn\u2019t understand.\u201d It seemed a continuation of a message she\u2019d hinted at back in October, when she tweeted, \u201cI was my ex-boyfriend\u2019s best quality. Pls RT.\u201d\n\nThe response has been immediate and deeply supportive. John Hodgman praised her \u201cprofound courage\u201d Rachel Bloom said, \u201cI am in awe of @BethStelling,\u201d and Kumail Nanjiani said, \u201cThis makes me feel many things but chief among them is that @BethStelling is awesome & I\u2019m happy we are friends.\u201d Megan Amram added, 8220;@BethStelling is my hero.\u201d But though Stelling has made it clear many people in and out of the industry know who he is, she did not name her ex. And this has proven very frustrating for some.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The comic reveals an abusive relationship -- but we need to respect the limits of her story", "title": "Beth Stelling doesn\u2019t need your Internet justice", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The comic reveals an abusive relationship -- but we need to respect the limits of her story", "title": "Beth Stelling doesn\u2019t need your Internet justice", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/12/29/beth_stelling_doesnt_need_your_internet_justice/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/12/beth_stelling.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The comic reveals an abusive relationship -- but we need to respect the limits of her story", "title": "Beth Stelling doesn\u2019t need your Internet justice", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/12/beth_stelling.jpg", "creator": "@embeedub", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Mary Elizabeth Williams", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, aol_on, Beth Stelling, bill cosby, Domestic abuse, Instagram, james deen, Sexual abuse", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "On Monday, Beth Stelling, who has had a banner career year and who Vulture recently dubbed \u201ca young comedian to watch,\u201d posted a shocking image on Instagram.\nBut here\u2019s a good first step: Don\u2019t make it about you and what you need.\nWhen I broke up with my ex this summer, it wasn\u2019t because I didn\u2019t love him, it was because of this.\nIt was a quartet of photos: one of her smiling and holding a microphone, and three of her limbs, covered in bruises.\n\u201cI\u2019ve had an amazing year and you\u2019ve seen the highlights here, so these photos are an uncommon thing to share but not an uncommon issue\u2026."}
