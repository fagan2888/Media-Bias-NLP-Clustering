That\u2019s how much extra it would theoretically cost to provide a decent healthcare plan to thousands of airline catering workers. An extra five cents a ticket, according to their union, could ensure that the person who prepares your reheated pasta tray doesn\u2019t sneeze on your butter pats because she can\u2019t afford to see a doctor. Ad Policy\n\nHundreds of catering workers represented by UNITE HERE marched in Washington, DC yesterday to demand access to decent health insurance that will help them stay healthy, do their job safely, and avoid falling further into poverty. Representing some 12,000 airline catering workers with major contractors like Gate Gourmet and Sky Chefs, the union is calling on the big airlines to build into their supply chain the cost of decent healthcare, which they calculate as roughly five cents per ticket, to be passed down to workers to offset insurance costs.\n\nAccording to a national survey of airline catering workers, over 40 percent of catering service workers\u2014who handle meal preparation, processing and logistics at airports across the country\u2014earn less than $10.10 per hour. That\u2019s well below a living wage in many of the cities where major airports are located (and less than the minimum wage repeatedly proposed by the Obama administration to bring the base wage closer to 1960s levels). According to UNITE HERE, extremely low wages leave workers \u201cunable to pay the premiums of so-called \u2018minimum value plans,\u2019 [those complying with federal mandates] but ineligible to purchase more affordable options from health care exchanges.\u201d\n\nDespite the introduction of Obamacare, precarious airline catering workers have fallen into an insurance black hole. Though they are unionized, many earn just above the threshold to qualify for a federal subsidy, so they may end up getting penalized for being unable to afford the prohibitive cost of a $120-a-month plan with a deductible that effectively prices them out of needed services.\n\nLos Angeles-based food service worker Manuel Valdovinos earns just enough to afford care this year, but says he now owes a $300 federal fine because he couldn\u2019t afford to buy insurance last year. \u201cI had to get a second job just to cover the basic expenses,\u201d he tells The Nation. \u201cAnd the IRS feels that I owe them money, for not being able to afford it [last year]\u2026.What my second job is giving me, I\u2019m basically giving it away in healthcare.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/airport_catering_worker_rtr_img-275x173.jpg", "sailthru.author": "Michelle Chen", "description": "Caterers have joined the growing airport workers' movement for an end to back-breaking work and paltry benefits.", "generator": "WooCommerce 2.3.13", "og": {"site_name": "The Nation", "description": "Caterers have joined the growing airport workers' movement for an end to back-breaking work and paltry benefits.", "title": "It Would Cost Just 5 Cents More Per Plane Ticket to Get Airport Catering Workers Some Decent Healthcare", "url": "http://www.thenation.com/article/it-would-cost-just-5-cents-more-plane-ticket-get-airport-catering-workers-some-decent-he/", "image": {"width": 1500, "identifier": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/airport_catering_worker_rtr_img.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 975}, "updated_time": "2015-06-29T11:08:42+00:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Caterers have joined the growing airport workers' movement for an end to back-breaking work and paltry benefits.", "title": "It Would Cost Just 5 Cents More Per Plane Ticket to Get Airport Catering Workers Some Decent Healthcare", "url": "http://www.thenation.com/article/it-would-cost-just-5-cents-more-plane-ticket-get-airport-catering-workers-some-decent-he/", "image": {"src": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/airport_catering_worker_rtr_img.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/airport_catering_worker_rtr_img-1440x756.jpg", "width": 1500, "height": 975}, "site": "@TheNation", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "February 27th, 2015", "sailthru.title": "It Would Cost Just 5 Cents More Per Plane Ticket to Get Airport Catering Workers Some Decent Healthcare", "sailthru.tags": "Economy,Healthcare Policy,Labor Organizing,Blog", "fb": {"app_id": 192399944158735}, "sailthru.content_id": 115339, "keywords": "catering, airports, unite here, healthcare, gate gourmet, sky chefs, michelle chen, the nation", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheNationMagazine", "tag": "the nation", "published_time": "2015-02-27T21:51:52+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-29T11:08:42+00:00", "author": "http://www.thenation.com/author/mchen/"}, "sailthru.description": "They\u2019ve joined the growing airport workers' movement for an end to back-breaking work and paltry benefits.", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/airport_catering_worker_rtr_img-680x430.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf3da\"", "article_summary": "That\u2019s how much extra it would theoretically cost to provide a decent healthcare plan to thousands of airline catering workers.\nAccording to a national survey of airline catering workers, over 40 percent of catering service workers\u2014who handle meal preparation, processing and logistics at airports across the country\u2014earn less than $10.10 per hour.\nRepresenting some 12,000 airline catering workers with major contractors like Gate Gourmet and Sky Chefs, the union is calling on the big airlines to build into their supply chain the cost of decent healthcare, which they calculate as roughly five cents per ticket, to be passed down to workers to offset insurance costs.\nAd PolicyHundreds of catering workers represented by UNITE HERE marched in Washington, DC yesterday to demand access to decent health insurance that will help them stay healthy, do their job safely, and avoid falling further into poverty.\n\u201cI had to get a second job just to cover the basic expenses,\u201d he tells The Nation."}
