In Colorado, however, high school students with a nonprofit called \u201cColorado Youth Matter\u201d were busy visiting their legislators the day before the vote on a bill that would continue a grant for free methods of birth control.\n\nImplemented in 2008 with a multi-year grant requiring no appropriation from the state of Colorado, the Long-acting Reversible Contraception (LARC) program makes intrauterine devices (IUD) and hormonal implant contraceptives available at low or no cost to women between the ages of 15 and 24 throughout the state, targeting communities with high poverty rates. The grant that funds the LARC program, administered by the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, is due to sunset in June of this year. Those advocating for continuing the LARC program have worked with legislators to create House Bill 15-1194, also known as the \u201cIUD Bill,\u201d requiring a new appropriation of $5 million per year from the general fund.\n\nColorado Youth Matter, funded in-part by the state of Colorado, receives 16 percent of its monies through the Colorado Department of Human Services. The federal Personal Responsibility and Education Program (PREP) operates under the umbrella of the Affordable Care Act, and allots public health dollars to be given to programs aiming to decrease rates of teen pregnancy, sexually-transmitted disease, and related instances of school dropout. Colorado Youth Matter, which coordinates closely with other family planning and pro-choice advocates, is one such program.\n\nColorado Youth Matter scheduled their \u201cCapitol Action Day\u201d on March 9, in anticipation of the vote on HB 15-1194 that was originally scheduled for March 10. Youth Matter coordinator Taylor Stein made appointments for high school students to meet with legislators on both sides of the aisle.\n\nOne legislator indicated that the meeting with Colorado Youth Matter high school students consisted primarily of advocacy for the IUD bill. According to the legislator\u2019s account, the students opened by asking for support for the LARC program and remained largely focused on the bill and related issues. The young men and women from both rural and urban Colorado high schools came armed with talking points and statistics gleaned from a number of reproductive rights websites, and lobbied the legislator on this specific bill.\n\nThe stated mission of Colorado Youth Matters is \u201cWISE,\u201d an acronym for \u201cWorking to Institutionalize Sex-education,\u201d and it has branches in several Colorado school districts. The group finds interested participants through their Teen Outreach Program (TOP), and the CREATE, a national voter registration drive. Colorado Youth Matter offers \u2018mini grants\u2019 of $3,000-$5,000 to two or three school districts annually to implement comprehensive sex-education programs, despite the fact that, in 2013, Democrats in the Colorado Legislature passed a bill creating a new grant program to fund comprehensive sex-education programs for school districts which wanted it as part of their health curricula.\n\nThe Personal Responsibility Education Program, under which Colorado Youth Matter functions, awards grants to organizations which educate young people on abstinence and contraception, and seek to prevent pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections. Its title, however, denotes more learning and less activism.\n\nTo date, HB 15-1194 is waiting in the Colorado House of Representatives Appropriations Committee. If passed through that body it will then go to the Senate, which has a Republican majority.\n\nThis article was written by a contributor of Watchdog Arena, Franklin Center\u2019s network of writers, bloggers, and citizen journalists.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "A group called \"Colorado Youth Matter\" sent high school students to Denver to lobby for the 'IUD bill' to continue funding low cost or free birth control.", "title": "High schoolers sent to lobby for 'IUD bill' in Colorado - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/03/shutterstock_181677890.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-03-13T16:31:49+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/205609/iud-bill-birth-control-high-school/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "Watchdog Arena", "tag": "birth control,Colorado Youth Matter,contraceptives,HB 15-1194,IUD,IUD bill,LARC", "published_time": "2015-03-12T16:14:54+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-13T16:31:49+00:00"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "A group called \"Colorado Youth Matter\" sent high school students to Denver to lobby for the 'IUD bill' to continue funding low cost or free birth control.", "title": "High schoolers sent to lobby for 'IUD bill' in Colorado - Watchdog.org", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/03/shutterstock_181677890.jpg"}, "creator": "@watchdogorg", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "description": "A group called \"Colorado Youth Matter\" sent high school students to Denver to lobby for the 'IUD bill' to continue funding low cost or free birth control."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe23f9\"", "article_summary": "One legislator indicated that the meeting with Colorado Youth Matter high school students consisted primarily of advocacy for the IUD bill.\nColorado Youth Matter, funded in-part by the state of Colorado, receives 16 percent of its monies through the Colorado Department of Human Services.\nThe stated mission of Colorado Youth Matters is \u201cWISE,\u201d an acronym for \u201cWorking to Institutionalize Sex-education,\u201d and it has branches in several Colorado school districts.\nColorado Youth Matter scheduled their \u201cCapitol Action Day\u201d on March 9, in anticipation of the vote on HB 15-1194 that was originally scheduled for March 10.\nColorado Youth Matter, which coordinates closely with other family planning and pro-choice advocates, is one such program."}
