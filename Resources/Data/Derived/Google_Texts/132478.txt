If there is one skill President Obama has been honing recently, it’s his ability to shift the blame from himself onto others. From ISIS to Obamacare, the buck has definitely been passed.

At an event at Millennium Steel Service in Princeton, Ind., on Friday Obama faced a question from the general manager about the company’s rising healthcare costs due to Obamacare. The president basically responded with a “Well then you aren’t doing it right.”

“We are seeing almost a double-digit increase in health-care costs every year,” General Manager Mihir Paranjape said. “Do you think that trend is going to go down, and what can we do to control that trend?”

“That’s really interesting, you’re gonna have to talk to Henry [Jackson, the Millennium Steel Service CEO],” Obama said. “The question is whether you guys are shopping effectively enough.”

Obama said healthcare premiums were rising at the slowest rate in 50 years and that the higher-ups at Millennium Steel must just not be aware of the options they have within the Obamacare market.

But while Obama believes that any negative news about Obamacare must be the result of a Fox News report, numbers on the higher costs for companies actually derived from his own administration.

Earlier this year, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which has spearheaded the implementation of the law, found that nearly two-thirds of small businesses that currently offer health insurance to their workers will pay more for coverage this year. The report stated that about 11 million of the 17 million individuals who have health care plans through a small employer would see their premiums increase, while 6 million people will see lower premiums.
