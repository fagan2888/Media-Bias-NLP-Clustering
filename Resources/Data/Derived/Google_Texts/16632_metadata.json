IS SNOWED OUT \u2014 Or maybe it\u2019s snowed in? Either way, the House is out for the whole week, citing the \"severity\" of winter storm Jonas and the travel challenges. Federal agencies also are closed today.\n\n\u2014 Will ACA open enrollment be extended? The current period is scheduled to run through Jan. 31. But given the weather snarling the East Coast \u2014 plus the somewhat lackluster enrollment numbers in recent weeks \u2014 it wouldn't be a surprise to see HHS and state agencies push the deadline back, at least in blizzard-affected areas. They've done it in past years.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nWELCOME TO MONDAY \u2014 where Washington is continuing to thaw out from one of its biggest snowstorms in history. But how much snow did Washington get, anyway? The official numbers are being clouded by a minor scandal: The team of weather observers at Reagan National Airport messed up and lost their device. \"It was buried by the very snow it was supposed to measure,\" the Washington Post ruefully noted. As a result, the super-storm may not take its rightful place in weather history.\n\nMismanaged data collection \u2014 an idea that health wonks and politicos can relate to.

But it turns out Blue Cross actually re-enrolled Cruz into a narrow-network HMO, his presidential campaign explained on Friday night. \"Sen. Cruz believed the family was uninsured and asked the broker to pull quotes immediately for a new policy,\" a Cruz spokesperson said. \"The Cruz family is currently covered by a Blue Cross HMO.\"\n\nOBAMA ON AMERICA'S UNINSURED PROBLEMS: 'WE'VE CHANGED THAT' \u2014 The president's weekly address on Saturday focused on the Affordable Care Act's ripple effects, which he says have led to a healthier population and more stable economy. \"When I took office seven years ago this week, more than 15 percent of Americans went without health insurance,\" Obama said. \"We\u2019ve changed that.\"\n\nIn his address, Obama listed some of the law's benefits, including the requirement that insurers cover patients with pre-existing conditions. The president also stressed that \u2014 for the first time \u2014 more than 90 percent of Americans have health coverage. Here\u2019s his full statement:http://1.usa.gov/23kEI0O\n\nCANDIDATES ON HEALTH CARE \u2014 There was a fair amount of health care talk on the Sunday shows, with both leading Democratic candidates elaborating on their planned reforms.\n\n\u2014 Clinton pushes coverage expansion, pharma reform. Appearing on \"Meet the Press,\" Hillary Clinton reiterated her goal is to get Americans \"to 100 percent\" health coverage and promised to \"roll out what I intend to do to get there.\"\n\nShe also stressed that pharmaceutical reforms would be among her top priorities as president, including lowering the cost of medication. \"I'm going to use whatever tools I can to get us lower prices [and] cap those prescription drug companies,\" she told host Chuck Todd.\n\n\u2014 Sanders sticks to Medicare-for-all talking points. On \"Face the Nation,\" host John Dickerson pressed Bernie Sanders on his proposal to create a Medicare-for-all health insurance system, posing a question that's been mostly overlooked: Would Sanders' plan lead to long wait times?\n\n\"One of the criticisms of a national health care plan in other places is, maybe people can be covered, but the waiting times to get to actually see a doctor can be long and excruciatingly long,\" Dickerson said. \"What is your solution?\"\n\nSanders didn't answer directly, but stressed that the United States is among the only major countries without universal coverage. \"A Medicare-for-all single-payer system can guarantee quality health care to all of our people, and at the same time save middle-class families thousands of dollars a year,\" Sanders said.\n\nWHERE THEY STAND ON ABORTION POLICY \u2014 The candidates also are ramping up their language on abortion, Jennifer Haberkorn reports for Pro \u2014 and increasingly taking vocal stances. \"On the Republican side, all of the candidates oppose abortion and back legislation to ban it after 20 weeks of pregnancy,\" she writes. Meanwhile, the Democratic candidates strongly support abortion rights; Clinton has called to strike down the ban on federal funding of abortion, and Sanders on Friday argued to do the same.\n\nAs Jen writes, one reason why the stakes are so high is that the next president could appoint more than one Supreme Court justice, which could potentially undo the Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion. Her story:\n\n\u2014 One remarkable stat on our aging court: Jen's story reminds me of an incredible data point she shared last week: By Election Day, at least three Supreme Court justices will be 80 years old and a fourth will be 78 years old.\n\n** A message from PhRMA: Coverage does not necessarily mean access to care. More medicines are being excluded from coverage, deductibles and copays are going up and insurance companies are increasingly imposing other barriers to access.

Ed Markey has put a hold on Robert Califf's nomination to lead the FDA because of the agency's approval of OxyContin for children and its overall practices for reviewing opioid painkillers, Sarah Karlin reports for Pro.\n\n\u2014 Of course, no vote had been scheduled yet. Sen. Lisa Murkowski is already blocking a floor vote on Califf over the agency's decision not to require labeling of genetically engineering salmon, and Sen. Bernie Sanders also may hold up Califf's nomination because of his ties to the drug industry.\n\nZIKA VIRUS CONTINUES TO SPREAD \u2014 Three patients in New York State have tested positive for the virus, which is transmitted by mosquito and currently spreading across the Caribbean and Latin America. (All three patients recently returned from overseas.)\n\n\u2014 Why Zika is a concern: The virus's symptoms, which are relatively mild and flu-like, appear to be linked with brain damage in infants. El Salvador health officials are urging women not to get pregnant until 2018, and other Latin American countries have similar measures. There is no medication or vaccine to treat the virus.\n\nIN THE STATES: Lawmakers have again rejected Republican Gov. Matt Mead's proposal to expand the state\u2019s Medicaid program, which would have extended health coverage to nearly 20,000 low-income adults. And it's not likely to move ahead on a different path this year. In Colorado, advocates are holding a community forum on ColoradoCare, a single-payer plan that will be on the November ballot. More from State Week.\n\nGOP LAWMAKER: MEDICAID EXPANSION IS 'INEVITABLE' IN GEORGIA \u2014 Jim Galloway at the Atlanta Journal-Constitution flagged this: A local Republican lawmaker thinks Obamacare's Medicaid expansion is \"inevitable.\" \"I believe we will expand Medicaid,\" State Sen. Fran Millar told local TV last week. \"We want to do it so we have more control of it,\" he added, pointing to the Arkansas model. You may recall the state's chamber of commerce is in the midst of a nine-month study on health care access that could tee up a Medicaid debate in 2017.\n\nWSJ: THERANOS WOES COULD BUMP LAB FROM MEDICARE PARTICIPATION \u2014 CMS inspectors have found \"serious deficiencies\" at the lab-testing company and will release a formal report soon, the Wall Street Journal reports. \"Failing to fix the problems could put the Theranos lab at risk of suspension from the Medicare program,\" the Journal adds.\n\nOf course, many providers run afoul of Medicare inspections \u2014 and most of those issues get successfully resolved \u2014 so until we get more details, it's hard to know just how bad Theranos' latest problems actually are.\n\nCONGRATS TO NEW WINSTON FELLOWS \u2014 Olivia Pham, who currently attends the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill's public health program, and Kripa Sreepada, who attends Cornell University's Sloan Program in health administration, have been selected as the 2016-2017 Winston Health Policy Fellows a year long post-graduate experience in Washington, D.C. Current fellows Adrianna McIntyre and Lydia Orth were placed in Nancy Pelosi\u2019s office and the Democratic Health Subcommittee for Ways and Means, respectively.\n\nAVALERE ON HOW MEDICARE ADVANTAGE UNDERPAYS PLANS \u2014 On Friday, I reported that Avalere Health would release a new report that concluded Medicare Advantage's underpaying plans for chronically ill patients. The study's now posted, and here's a link.\n\nWHAT WE'RE READING\n\nAt Business Insider, Lydia Ramsey quizzed experts about which idea will disrupt the health care industry in 2016. http://read.bi/1WINIbo\n\nMore companies are using sticks, not just carrots, to get employees into wellness programs, the New York Times reports. http://nyti.ms/1KyVqh9\n\nMassachusetts is luring GE to set up its headquarters in the state, and officials have earmarked $5 million for GE to establish an \"innovation center\" focused on life sciences and digital health. The Boston Globe: http://bit.ly/1SdOigx\n\nWorking with Atul Gawande and the Harvard School of Public Health, South Carolina hospitals are piloting a statewide project to use surgical checklists, Modern Healthcare reports. http://bit.ly/1QnojBm\n\nClayton McWhorter, the former CEO of HCA and a prominent health care businessman, passed away this weekend. He was 82 years old. The Tennessean story: http://tnne.ws/1K5AnIf\n\n** A message from PhRMA: The medicine you need may not be covered by your health insurance plan or plans may require very high cost sharing. Insurers are increasingly making it hard to get the treatments you need to live a longer, healthier life by increasing deductibles and copays and creating other barriers to access. Here are 5 ways insurers may prevent you from accessing the medicine you need: (1) Prior authorization (2) Step therapy (3) Non-medical switching (4) High out-of-pocket costs (5) Not covered at all. When you\u2019re choosing coverage be sure to look carefully at how \u2014 and if \u2014 the medicines you and your family need are covered.

The lack of transparency also raises questions as to whether drug plan middlemen, pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) corporations, are overpaid by Medicare and other federal health programs. Moreover, when generic drug prices spike, PBM corporations are slow to update reimbursement rates, leaving community pharmacies with payments that don\u2019t cover costs and unsustainable financial losses. H.R. 244 would increase transparency and facilitate timely payment updates.
