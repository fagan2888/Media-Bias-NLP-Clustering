The 44-year-old Fairbanksan teaches at West Valley High School, an ideal spot to meld his love of learning, language and pop culture.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been teaching since \u201894, I haven\u2019t worked a day since,\u201d he said with a smile.\n\nIn recent years, his role as an educator has complemented a prominent place in the arts community.\n\nHe\u2019s directing \u201cKung Fu Hamlet,\u201d the opening play in the Fairbanks Drama Association season and leading a handful of former students in the production. That includes Jun Shin, who plays the title role in the spoof, which is a deadpan combination of Shakepeare\u2019s tragic tale with Hong Kong martial arts films of the 1970s.\n\nFDA Executive Director Peggy Ferguson said Shaeffer\u2019s experience as a teacher and natural comic timing have allowed him to excel as a director.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very fond of him and have great respect for him,\u201d Ferguson said. \u201cHe\u2019s not only brilliant, but he\u2019s kind, and for me that\u2019s the winning combination.\u201d\n\nShaeffer started his career as a radio DJ in Brookings, South Dakota, hosting \u201880s pop and alternative rock shows for a pair of local stations.\n\nHe got nudged out of his on-air role along with a shift to adult-contemporary music, and was eventually shifted to an unwanted sales job.\n\nThe change led to his teaching career, and ultimately, his move to Alaska. After he returned to college to earn his teaching certificate and spent a few years working in South Dakota, Shaeffer went to a job fair from the Northwest Arctic Borough School District almost on a whim.\n\nTo his surprise, he ended up accepting a job in Kotzebue and packed for a move to Alaska.\n\n\u201cI thought I could do anything for 9 months,\u201d he said. \u201cI ended up there for 3 years and loved it. I can\u2019t wait to get back.\u201d\n\nHe spent time in Chevak and Sand Point before arriving in Fairbanks in 2006.\n\nHe\u2019s been an enthusiastic performer, appearing in about a dozen local plays and developing an hour-long set of spoken-word poetry. His humorous thoughts include pieces about Patrick Swayze, Elvis and superheroes, among other quirky topics.\n\nHe took his slam poetry set on the road last summer, performing a show called \u201cHot Lava\u201d for audiences in Minneapolis and Kansas City.\n\nShaeffer said his love of pop culture has helped serve as a tool in education. Although he got his start playing songs now three decades old, the experience provides an entry point for high school kids today.\n\n\u201cMusic is a great common ground for students,\u201d Shaeffer said. \u201cThey aren\u2019t always going to dial in and connect the dots, but it can make a difference with a reluctant learner or struggling student.\u201d\n\nHe received an artist grant from the Rasmuson Foundation this year to teach the Twelve Labors of Hercules in a dozen Alaska communities. He started in Barrow, where his discussion focused on the link between ancient myths and modern comic book heroes.\n\n\u201cIt shows we\u2019re still celebrating these myths, and people are still interested in them,\u201d he said.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Fairbanks (Alaska) Daily News-Miner, http://www.newsminer.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "Michael Shaeffer has a lot on his mind.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Michael Shaeffer has a lot on his mind.", "title": "Fairbanks teacher blends genres for local play", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/sep/20/fairbanks-teacher-blends-genres-for-local-play/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/09/20/36cccc9de88b2924600f6a706700d557.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/09/20/36cccc9de88b2924600f6a706700d557.jpg", "description": "Michael Shaeffer has a lot on his mind.", "card": "summary", "title": "Fairbanks teacher blends genres for local play"}, "Author": "JEFF RICHARDSON", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "Shaeffer seems like the kind of guy who would make a fun high school English teacher - which, in fact, is what he is.\n___Information from: Fairbanks (Alaska) Daily News-Miner, http://www.newsminer.com\nAlthough he got his start playing songs now three decades old, the experience provides an entry point for high school kids today.\nFAIRBANKS, Alaska (AP) - Michael Shaeffer has a lot on his mind.\nThe 44-year-old Fairbanksan teaches at West Valley High School, an ideal spot to meld his love of learning, language and pop culture."}
