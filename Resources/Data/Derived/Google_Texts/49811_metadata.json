That\u2019s because Slavitt\u2019s agency plays a critical role in setting health care policy, with big implications for the hospital and insurance industry in Boston and beyond.\n\nSlavitt spoke at the Partners-sponsored World Medical Innovation Forum, and later in an interview with the Globe. Here are a few takeaways from his remarks:\n\n\u25a0 Many drugs to treat conditions from hepatitis to cancer now cost tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars per patient per year, and drug costs are rising fast. With that in mind, Slavitt said the government and the health care industry need to make medical treatments affordable for patients who need them.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an important thing for us to debate,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to run some experiments. We have to run some pilots. We have to figure out what works.\u201d\n\n\u25a0 CMS is already trying some of those experiments. It is on track to change how it pays doctors and hospitals so that payments are tied to quality measures and value, and not based simply on the number of medical services performed. Slavitt summed it up this way: \u201cIf the quality outcomes are better, and it\u2019s done at an efficient cost, then we pay more.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMedicare and commercial insurers have started adopting these so-called alternative or value-based payments, which pay health care providers a budget for delivering care. These kinds of payments are supposed to encourage better coordination of patient care while helping to contain costs, but the results so far are mixed. Some health care providers have lost money, and others report only modest savings. But Slavitt said new payment models need more time to work.\n\n\u201cWe are really in what I would consider to be generation one or maybe generation two of these models,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are still at the learning stages.\u201d\n\nSlavitt compared these payment models to the evolution of the iPhone, which advanced from its earliest version to the more powerful device of today.\n\n\u25a0 The federal government has imposed numerous new health care regulations in recent years, prompting doctors to describe them regulations as time-consuming burdens that hamper patient care. Earlier this year, Slavitt acknowledged regulators have lost the \u201chearts and minds\u201d of physicians. \u201cI do think it can be won back,\u201d he said Tuesday.\n\nSlavitt said the way CMS pays doctors in the future will be more aligned with how doctors want to practice. He did not specify how new regulations would work.\n\n\u201cWhen you see what actually does engage physicians, which is more freedom, less control, less burden, it\u2019s quite exciting,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re quite excited by these new models that accomplish that.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"eomportal-loid": "4.1.3426387769", "eomportal-id": 418799, "description": "Andy Slavitt is acting administrator for the agency that oversees health coverage for 140 million people covered by Medicare, Medicaid, and the Affordable Care Act.", "eomportal-instanceid": 26, "og": {"city": "Boston", "site_name": "BostonGlobe.com", "description": "Andy Slavitt is acting administrator for the agency that oversees health coverage for 140 million people covered by Medicare, Medicaid, and the Affordable Care Act.", "title": "Obama official speaks out on health care industry in Boston visit - The Boston Globe", "url": "https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2016/04/27/slavitt/HmV8Mr1j2jzvH0C4bjF5sM/story.html", "image": "http://c.o0bg.com/rf/image_585w/Boston/2011-2020/2016/04/27/BostonGlobe.com/Business/Images/slavitt.jpg", "state": "MA", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"account_id": 95431448, "card": "summary", "site": "BostonGlobe"}, "robots": "noarchive", "news_keywords": "andy slavitt,medicare,medicaid,cms,health care,alternative payments,partners healthcare,david torchiana", "eomportal-lastUpdate": "Fri May 27 09:18:54 EDT 2016", "fb": {"admins": 507486035, "app_id": 103933749691726, "pages": 5637143257}, "keywords": "andy slavitt,medicare,medicaid,cms,health care,alternative payments,partners healthcare,david torchiana", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/globe"}, "flashsale": "false", "viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "eomportal-uuid": "fb601d80-0c71-11e6-9ff1-e41d1845cd8a"}, "article_summary": "A top Obama administration health care official stopped in Boston on Tuesday to share his thoughts on the direction of the health care industry.\nThat\u2019s because Slavitt\u2019s agency plays a critical role in setting health care policy, with big implications for the hospital and insurance industry in Boston and beyond.\nAdvertisementHe\u2019s a government official, but Partners HealthCare chief executive Dr. David Torchiana calls Slavitt the most important person in health care.\n\u25a0 The federal government has imposed numerous new health care regulations in recent years, prompting doctors to describe them regulations as time-consuming burdens that hamper patient care.\nSome health care providers have lost money, and others report only modest savings."}
