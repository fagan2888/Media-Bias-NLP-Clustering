This latest change was not approved unanimously, but by a vote of 6-2.\n\nStill, that majority agreed with a subcommittee recommendation to add 40,000 square feet of exhibit space and 5,000 square feet of meeting space, for a new total gross square footage of 550,000 square feet.\n\nThis expansion is expected to take the project's cost from $252 million to $287 million. City leaders say the extra $35 million will come from a MAPS infrastructure fund and contingency fund.\n\nThe changes are easy to make because the project is still very much in the conceptual stage. We do know the convention center will sit just west of the Chesapeake Arena, between the Myriad Gardens and the city's new park, and is likely to include a separately financed 700-plus-room headquarters hotel.\n\nOklahoma City convention industry officials say the project remains on track for a mid-2016 groundbreaking, with completion sometime in 2019.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "The new convention center Oklahoma City is building as part of MAPS 3 is going to be bigger than originally planned.", "author": "Alex Cameron", "og": {"url": "http://www.news9.com/story/27295891/okc-city-council-approves-more-funding-for-convention-center", "image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/5603660_G.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The new convention center Oklahoma City is building as part of MAPS 3 is going to be bigger than originally planned.", "title": "OKC City Council Approves More Funding For Convention Center"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/5603660_G.jpg", "description": "The new convention center Oklahoma City is building as part of MAPS 3 is going to be bigger than originally planned.", "card": "summary", "title": "OKC City Council Approves More Funding For Convention Center"}, "wnreadableurl": "okc-city-council-approves-more-funding-for-convention-center", "ROBOTS": "index,follow,noarchive", "owner": "KWTV", "fb": {"app_id": 538140636230283}, "date": "2014/11/05", "KEYWORDS": "oklahoma city,convention center,more funding,larger,square feet,alex cameron,kwtv,cbs,news9", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS19", "verify-v1": "d5ZN+GNiazjgWlnr3WHikwraMvFljdUSLMgex4CGnc8=", "news_keywords": "oklahoma city,convention center,more funding,larger,square feet,alex cameron,kwtv,cbs,news9"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda82a\"", "article_summary": "Oklahoma City convention industry officials say the project remains on track for a mid-2016 groundbreaking, with completion sometime in 2019.\nThe new convention center Oklahoma City is building as part of MAPS 3 is going to be bigger than originally planned.\nThe city council approved a nearly 20 percent increase in the project's scope on Tuesday and, of course, that increase comes with a price tag.\nCity leaders say the extra $35 million will come from a MAPS infrastructure fund and contingency fund.\nThis expansion is expected to take the project's cost from $252 million to $287 million."}
