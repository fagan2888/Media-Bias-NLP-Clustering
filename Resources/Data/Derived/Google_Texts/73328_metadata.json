The stock hit a market cap of more than $4 billion, for a company with 2013 revenue of just $13 million.\n\nThough the stock\u2019s come closer to earth since then, Castlight (CSLT) continued the comeback for health care IT IPOs. Drug IPOs have gone gangbusters since early last year, but HCITs didn\u2019t get rolling until the fall, when Benefitfocus (BNFT) and Veeva Systems (VEEV) debuted.\n\nTwo more HCIT IPOs are scheduled: on Thursday, consumer-oriented health website Everyday Health (EVDY), and next week, in a stark contrast to all the tiny startups, venerable health-industry data and consulting services provider IMS Health (IMS).\n\nAbout 125 HCIT companies in the portfolios of top venture capital and private equity firms are \u201cripening\u201d to where they\u2019re ready for an exit, says Paul Teitelbaum, managing director at boutique investment bank Mesirow Financial.\n\nTeitelbaum expects most of those exits will be buyouts, but he also expects more to go public this year since so few went out last year.\n\n\u201cPeople (were) waiting to see how the Affordable Care Act was going to roll out and how that was going to impact various different sectors of health care,\u201d he said. \u201cSome of the companies who were looking to exit were holding off until they reached certain levels of revenue and profitability.\u201d\n\nThe small size of most of the IPO candidates is in part because many were started during the Obama administration. The 2009 stimulus package included incentives toward digitizing health care, particularly medical records, which led to a boom in HCIT stocks already trading as well as the formation of more startups.\n\nMost of the established stocks in IBD\u2019s Computer Software-Medical Industry Group, such as Cerner (CERN) and Allscripts (MDRX), sell products that help run hospitals and doctors\u2019 offices, so they took naturally to electronic health records.\n\nThe more recent IPOs, however, have a more eclectic variety of business models. Castlight and Benefitfocus both help employers shop for health plans, while Veeva\u2019s software handles sales and marketing functions for drugmakers.\n\nAnalyst Michael Cherny of ISI Group says the newer companies had to carve out their own niches.\n\n\u201cIn an environment where there are so many established competitive players in the pure electronic-health-record/practice management market, the fact that there are other technologies that are needed creates an opportunity for venture-capital-backed companies to create business models that just now are big enough to stand alone as public companies,\u201d he said.\n\nTeitelbaum says one need that became more apparent as ObamaCare rolled out was for consumers to take more control of their health care, as they often end up shouldering more of the expenses. Castlight, Benefitfocus and Everyday Health all pitch their consumer focus as a major selling point.\n\nAlong that line, he says Vitals and Healthgrades are two consumer-oriented health companies he sees ripening for possible IPOs. Both help users find and rate physicians, in a similar way to how you might find a plumber on Angie\u2019s List (ANGI).\n\nProviders, meanwhile, are facing a world where more than ever their pay will be tied to outcomes, which creates business for companies offering population health management and disease-management software.\n\nAmong the possible IPOs in that field, Teitelbaum points to MediMedia, which has both a population-health arm and a consumer arm, and America Well, which assists disease management by letting doctors and patients consult online.\n\nThe old practice-management field also might produce a few more IPOs. Both Teitelbaum and Cherny point to Practice Fusion, which offers online electronic health records for free. Cherny also highlights CareCloud, which offers both records and other practice-management solutions online.\n\nSince these companies are small enough to be \u201cemerging\u201d under the Jobs Act, they can file confidentially, so investors might not know when these firms are going public until a couple weeks before their debuts. Meanwhile, Teitelbaum and Cherny note, we shouldn\u2019t expect another Castlight anytime soon \u2014 either in terms of how early in its life cycle it went out, or the massive valuation.\n\n\u201cThat was quite remarkable,\u201d Teitelbaum said. \u201c\u2018Crazy\u2019 is even a word I would venture to use.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "It's been a big year for IPOs, but one of its wildest days was March 14, when Castlight Health soared 149% on its first day of trading.
