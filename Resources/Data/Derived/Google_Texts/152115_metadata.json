In social settings, the latter can hamper an individual\u2019s confidence, which researchers are finding is a significant indicator of their overall health and happiness.\n\nResearchers from Case Western Reserve University's Frances Payne Bolton School of Nursing are among the first to study what makes MS patients happy \u2014 the details of their work can be found in the Journal of Rehabilitation Medicine. They asked 335 people who had been living with MS for about 15 years to rank the activities most important to them. These activities were reported to be \u201cgetting out and about, spending time with family and friends, managing bills and expenses, and participating in clubs and civic and political events.\u201d\n\nBy finding out what people with MS enjoy doing, or who they enjoy visiting, researchers could narrow down what was keeping them from engaging in their favorite activities, as well as with others. The results revealed that \u201cstruggling with impairments, like MS fatigue and cognitive and walking problems\u2026 inadequate social support and transportation issues\u2026 impede a person\u2019s confidence.\u201d Lack of confidence also influences how well people with MS manage their symptoms.\n\nPut another way: physical impairments, lacking support, and environmental factors act as barriers between those with MS and health and happiness. Researchers explained that not being able to overcome these barriers could possibly lead to secondary symptoms, \u201clike depression, deconditioning from lack of exercise, and poor nutrition or eating choices that may result in obesity or diabetes.\u201d\n\nThe National MS Society reports that \u201cdisease-modifying therapy is currently the best way to reduce MS disease activity and improve quality of life.\u201d It includes medications that can \u201clessen the frequency and severity of MS attacks, reduce the accumulation of lesions (areas of damage) in the brain,\" and possibly slow the progression of disability.\n\nYet, this study suggests it would be beneficial to people if treatments also focus on their mental health, too. Matthew Plow, the study\u2019s lead author, said in a press release that it would be worthwhile to test an intervention designed to boost people's confidence levels, which may equip them to make any changes and learn new skills in order to engage more with their community.\n\nSource: Plow M, et al.
