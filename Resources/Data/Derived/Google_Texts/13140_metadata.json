His latest book is: \u201c The Power of RELENTLESS! \u201d Dubbed by the media as \u201cthe Capitalist Evangelist,\u201d Wayne is a former Libertarian Vice Presidential nominee, international business speaker, serial entrepreneur and conservative media personality \u2013 appearing on over 5,000 interviews in the past five years. Wayne\u2019s web site: ROOTforAmerica.com .\n\nConservatives spend alot of time complaining and criticizing President Barack Obama and his economic policies. Liberals claim we don\u2019t offer a detailed alternative plan.\n\nWell here\u2019s a plan for the Republican Party. If they want to win elections by a landslide\u2026if they want to save the economy\u2026and if they want to create 20 million middle class jobs almost overnight.\n\nBack in 1994, a \u201cContract with America\u201d won Republicans control of Congress. In my latest book, \u201cThe Murder of the Middle Class,\u201d I lay out the \u201cMiddle Class Contract with America\u201d that will help do it again in 2014 and 2016. If only the GOP would listen, we could turn around this terrible economy, save the middle class and return America to greatness.\n\nRepublicans need to do more than be against Obama. They need to present their vision and a detailed plan for how to reinvigorate the economy and create millions of high-paying middle class jobs. Here is the 10-point plan that can stop this long-term decline and dysfunction and once again make America\u2019s middle class the greatest in the world. A \u201cMiddle Class Contract with America\u201d created by a small business owner (that\u2019s me) can do it again.\n\nThis is a common sense contract to protect, save and serve America\u2019s middle class. This \u201ccontract\u201d has only three goals: Support, stimulate, and reward middle class job creation.\n\nNational Income Tax Vacation\n\nPresident Ronald Reagan already proved a radical plan that gives power (and money) back to the people will turn even the worst recession since the Great Depression into the biggest economic expansion in world history. Reagan saved America from economic ruin by cutting taxes from 70 percent to 28 percent. This idea is Reagan on steroids!\n\nObama wasted over $2 trillion (the updated cost) on a \u201cstimulus to nowhere.\u201d He gambled on big government and lost. Six years later, there is still no recovery for small business or middle class jobs.\n\nLike Reagan, I\u2019m betting on the private sector. Government cannot save us from this Obama Great Depression. Only the taxpayers, investors and small business owners can save us. So my version of \u201cstimulus\u201d goes to the group of citizens that pay the taxes and create the jobs.\n\nMy National Income Tax Vacation lets taxpayers take a vacation from income taxes and keep 100 percent of their income for one year. Sit back and watch the greatest economic explosion in world history.\n\nWhat will they do with their windfall? Start businesses\u2026build businesses\u2026expand businesses\u2026buy stocks, homes, autos and go on a consumer-spending-binge. And of course an orgy of spending by the citizens creates real private sector jobs (as opposed to government jobs that cost taxpayers money).\n\nThis plan puts the money in the hands of \u201cthe financial first responders,\u201d not government. The people who pay taxes and create jobs by starting businesses will save America \u2013 just as they did under President Reagan.\n\nMillions of jobs will be created (and they won\u2019t be part-time low wage jobs flipping burgers). Obama\u2019s belief in government has failed the middle class. This plan puts the power in the hands of entrepreneurs and taxpayers.\n\nCritics will ask, \u201cHow do we pay for it?\u201d The total cost of my income tax vacation is $1.2 trillion (that\u2019s all the personal income taxes in America for one year). That\u2019s half of Obama\u2019s 2009 stimulus. The updated cost for Obama\u2019s stimulus plan is $2.5 trillion. How come no one asked where Obama would find the money for his stimulus?\n\nThis economy is even worse than President Jimmy Carter\u2019s economy. So we need a radical game changer. We need Reagan squared.\n\nThis is how you save America \u2013 by inspiring and rewarding all the people who actually pay taxes\u2026instead of punishing them and stealing their money to reward the freeloaders with their hands out. Obama proved that idea is a disaster.\n\nThe 0-15-0 Tax Plan\n\nThe country needs a game changer. My 0-15-0 tax plan is exactly that. It is modeled after Hong Kong, the greatest booming economy in the world (with 3.5 percent unemployment). We return from the one-year personal income tax vacation with a 15 percent flat tax.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that Hong Kong allows deductions for mortgage and charitable deductions. It works. Copy it.\n\nYou hear me GOP? Stop trying to eliminate mortgage and charitable deductions with a flat tax. That\u2019s just plain stupid. The economy depends on real estate and home ownership. Churches and charities depend on deductibility of donations. Hong Kong\u2019s booming economy proves a flat tax works with both of those deductions included.\n\nSecondly, Hong Kong also has a zero capital gains tax. So does our No. 1 competitor in the world \u2013 China. We must match China or lose market share. A zero capital gains tax will motivate an explosion in investments and startups. That\u2019s how you jumpstart a middle class jobs explosion.\n\nJumpstart Job Creation With an \u201cAngel Investors Tax Credit\u201d\n\nTwo of every three new jobs are created by small business. A majority of these new jobs are created during the first three years of a new business startup. We need to encourage more startups.\n\nUnder this \u201cAngel Investors Tax Credit\u201d investors receive a dollar for dollar tax credit for up to 50 percent of their income tax bill (up to $25,000) for investments in new business startups.\n\nThis isn\u2019t for millionaires. It\u2019s tailor-made just for middle class investors. Over a decade any middle class American can invest $25,000 per year, and after 10 years they save $250,000 from the clutches of the IRS.\n\nIf any of those businesses succeed, middle class taxpayers can build a million dollar nest-egg for retirement. More importantly, millions of jobs will be created with all this money flowing into business startups.\n\nWhat do all new businesses need? Employees.\n\nCreate a \u201cReverse Inversion\u201d\n\nInversion is when U.S. companies run away from America because we have the highest corporate taxes in the industrialized world. I want to cut the corporate tax rate to a flat 15 percent, so companies across the globe want to practice \u201creverse inversion\u201d by coming to America, not running away!\n\nSecondly, encourage U.S. companies to bring all their offshore money back into the U.S. Financial experts estimate American corporations have over $2 trillion parked offshore because of high U.S. corporate tax rates.\n\nMy plan allows companies to bring their foreign earnings back to America with only a small 10 percent tax/penalty. Companies will rush to take advantage \u2013 thereby instantly producing about $200 billion in new tax revenues to be applied to debt reduction. Better yet the remaining $1.8 trillion dollars will be pumped into the U.S. economy.\n\nThird, model the great (and booming) state of Texas and pass a national \u201cLoser\u2019s Pays Law.\u201d You want corporations to bring back jobs from overseas? Reduce frivolous lawsuits and watch what happens.\n\nAnyone want to bet? Do these three things and every company in the world will want to move to America. Watch millions of jobs be ON-shored, instead of offshored.\n\nEndangered Humans Protection Act\n\nThe average energy job in Texas pays about $150,000 per year. These are the kind of jobs that can save the American middle class. Because of technological advances, America is in the middle of an energy revolution. If only the Obama administration would take the shackles off, America could become the energy capital of the world.\n\nHow do we create millions of great jobs?\n\nApprove Keystone XL; increase energy production; encourage more fracking and clean coal; and ease regulations so we can export more of America\u2019s No. 1 product to our allies in Europe. That\u2019s how we defeat Russia too. We become the energy supplier to the world.\n\nOh and kill the Enviornmental Protection Agency. Today. As in this minute.\n\nThe energy industry has more of a direct impact on middle class Americans than any other issue. Creating high-paying energy jobs would lower unemployment, boost the tax base, lower the debt and dramatically lower everyone\u2019s energy bills \u2013 leading to increased consumer spending.\n\nThe middle class is saved by $150,000 energy jobs. It\u2019s destroyed by job-killing green energy. The party that offers that vision sweeps to landslide victory.\n\nLegalize, Regulate and Tax \u201cSins\u201d Like Marijuana and Online Gambling\n\nThis is what we do in Nevada and the result is we are able to afford zero state income tax and zero business income tax. We should be replicating this model through the U.S. Because it works.\n\nAre you listening GOP? Get out of our bedrooms, as well as our boardrooms. Let people do what they want, stop sticking your had in the sand, tax it and reap the benefits. By the way, this is how you create even more jobs.\n\nReturn to the Gold Standard\n\nThe dollar has lost about 98 percent of its buying power since 1913, when the Federal Reserve was founded. We need a Gold Standard to back the dollar with something real and tangible. This prevents politicians from spending us into bankruptcy by making spending promises with money we don\u2019t have. It also reduces the likelihood of a debt crisis, dollar collapse, or the loss of \u201cworld reserve currency status.\u201d\n\nRepeal and Replace Obamacare with a Health Freedom Plan\n\nThe economy cannot improve without the repeal of Obamacare.\n\nHealth insurance premiums are up more since Obamacare started than in the eight previous years combined. Heck, they are up 88 percent in liberal, Obama-loving California alone.\n\nThis is bankrupting middle class consumers and destroying our economy. Obamacare is also a middle class high-wage job killer. There can be no good-paying middle class jobs until the regulations and taxes of Obamacare are repealed. Period. Obamacare has to go or nothing else will work.\n\nSeal the Border and Reform Immigration Policy\n\nAfter the border is sealed with a virtual wall (protected by thousands of drones) create a path to permanent residency (with work permits), but NEVER citizenship for any illegal immigrant. They\u2019ve lost the right to vote by breaking the law.\n\nOur wide-open border is leading to disaster for the economy. Millions of poor desperate immigrants arriving here to demand welfare and food stamps will bankrupt our economy and force massive tax increases.\n\nBut a terrorist attack or Ebola pandemic on U.S. soil is even worse \u2013 and both can happen tomorrow because the border is wide open. One terrorist attack and this already vulnerable economy will drop off a cliff. One Ebola pandemic and commerce will grind to a halt. No one will leave their homes out of fear.\n\nThe border is the key to all of this. Seal it to save America\u2019s economy from destruction.\n\nLimit the Power of Congress and All Branches of the Federal Government\n\nThis starts with term limits. I believe all politicians should be limited to two terms \u2013 one term in office and one term in prison.\n\nThat\u2019s a short outline of my plan to save this economy and country, direct from the pages of my book, \u201cThe Murder of The Middle Class.\u201d We need HOPE, not just criticism. This plan is all about hope.\n\nAmerica is in decline, but it\u2019s still savable. We can turn it around. There is still time, but the window is small. This plan will create 20 million new jobs quickly- just as Reagan\u2019s tax cuts did in the 1980\u2019s.\n\nIt restores economic freedom. It rewards entrepreneurship. It stimulates small business job creation. It limits the power of government \u2013 just as the Constitution demands. It puts the power back in the hands of the people. Most importantly, it will restore the American Dream for middle class Americans.\n\nThis answers all the liberal critics who claim all conservatives or Libertarians do is complain and criticize. They ask \u201cWhat\u2019s your plan?\u201d\n\nWell here it is. Now shut up and get out of the way. You\u2019ve done enough damage. You caused enough chaos, crisis and pain. It\u2019s time to let the responsible adults take over.\n\nWayne\u2019s latest book is: \u201cThe Murder of the Middle Class.\u201d Wayne Allyn Root is a former Libertarian Vice Presidential nominee, successful entrepreneur, small business defender, business speaker, Capital Evangelist, and media personality \u2013 appearing on over 5,000 interviews in the past five years.
