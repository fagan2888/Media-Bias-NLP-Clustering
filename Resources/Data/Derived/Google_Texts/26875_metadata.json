As for the Republicans, they\u2019re feeling as if they\u2019re losing control of the country.\n\n\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s going to be challenging because you\u2019ve got one party that has determined that the current solution is unacceptable,\u201d Ryan said.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the sixth anniversary, and yet there still hasn\u2019t been a meaningful piece of legislation that\u2019s gone through the Congress to address this. You don\u2019t like the Affordable Care Act, what\u2019s your alternative?\u201d\n\nDown to the numbers\n\nSince 2010, an estimated 20 million people have gained health insurance coverage because of the Affordable Care Act, according to estimates released early this month by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s one of the law\u2019s more notable accomplishments, said Lori Maite, Columbus-based executive director in Ernst & Young\u2019s national Affordable Care Act practice.\n\n\n\nMaite considers several other outcomes of the law successful: The Medicaid expansion in Ohio and in many other states, dependents\u2019 ability to stay covered until the age of 26 and opening the door to people with preexisting conditions to get insurance. But there are many other things the Affordable Care Act set within its goals \u201cthat we aren\u2019t quite there yet,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\nFor one, there are still \u201csignificant numbers\u201d of people without insurance, and gender parity within health plans hasn\u2019t taken hold. Individual mandates, in which uninsured people are fined, are beginning to take hold and will continue to increase each year. The employer mandate is also coming online this year with required reporting and a higher threshold of employees who must be covered \u2014 95% versus 70% last year, which wasn\u2019t all that difficult for many to meet, Maite said.\n\n\n\n\u201cOnce they\u2019re able to issue reports and understand if they\u2019re meeting the 95% threshold, a lot of companies are starting to understand or get their arms around what the overall cost of the Affordable Care Act is to them \u2014 the cost of compliance with the Affordable Care Act and all of its nuances,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\nWhile the law is covering more Americans, many consumers remain frustrated with costs.\n\n\n\nOn one level, Ryan said, more people are protected from life-altering medical bills that come with a significant health event. But on the other hand, the Affordable Care Act isn\u2019t doing much to change the health status of communities and individuals; to improve access to primary and preventative care or change incentives for people to live healthier lifestyles, he said.\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd as a result, we\u2019re not changing the health care expenditure curve at all,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cHealth insurance isn\u2019t set up to keep people healthy. Now that\u2019s a second part of what the Affordable Care Act is trying to do, and that\u2019s probably the place where it has had the most difficulty.\u201d\n\nAnd the solution is?\n\nRobert J. Klonk, CEO of Oswald Cos., a Cleveland-based insurance brokerage, spent time in Washington, D.C., before the law was approved educating politicians on the law\u2019s potential effect on employers. A lot of those concerns have come to pass, he said, such as administrative burdens on employers and high premiums and deductibles for employees.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut even this critic of the law points to several positive outcomes. Those with pre-existing conditions cannot be refused insurance. This was needed, \u201cno doubt about it,\u201d Klonk said. Subsidies for low-income Americans, a shift to value-based care and the ability to keep dependents on health plans until they are 26 years old were all needed.\u201cThere are some good aspects of what has happened in the ACA,\u201d Klonk said. \u201cJust the way it was structured was structured not to be sustainable.\u201dCarriers are considering pulling back, cost projections are rising and employers are spending time and money trying to understand rules that can later change, he said.Ryan of the Center for Health Affairs said he understands the political frustrations, \u201cbut absent a strategy to address those issues, our health care system is going to collapse.\u201dCase\u2019s White said how much this plays into the election depends largely on who the nominees are. Currently leading Republican candidate Donald Trump, for instance, would do a good job of rallying the base.\u201cThe Republicans who think it\u2019s terrible, terrible, terrible and awful will be reminded they ought to turn out to vote so they can get rid of terrible, terrible, terrible, awful,\u201d he said.White said Hillary Clinton, now the frontrunner in the Democratic race, and the party should \u201ctry to remind people how silly so much of this discussion has been.\u201dThere haven\u2019t been a lot of facts out there, Klonk said.\u201cOne side thinks it\u2019s working great, the other side wants to repeal and replace it,\u201d he said. \u201cNeither one are the answer. It needs to be fixed. It needs to be fixed quickly.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "This Wednesday, March 23, marks the sixth anniversary of the signing of the Affordable Care Act, but industry observers aren't so sure President Barack Obama's controversial health care law will get the same attention in this contentious election cycle as it has in years past.", "og": {"site_name": "Crain's Cleveland Business", "description": "This Wednesday, March 23, marks the sixth anniversary of the signing of the Affordable Care Act, but industry observers aren't so sure President Barack Obama's controversial health care law will get the same attention in this contentious election cycle as it has in years past.", "title": "Presidential hopefuls offer little Obamacare insight", "url": "http://www.crainscleveland.com/article/20160320/NEWS/160319781/presidential-hopefuls-offer-little-obamacare-insight", "image": "http://www.crainscleveland.com/assets/cc/CCLB_Iconv2.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@crainscleveland", "card": "summary"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#a91d38", "fb": {"app_id": 730748806957003}, "theme-color": "#a91d38", "msapplication-TileImage": "/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"section": "NEWS", "published_time": "2016-03-20T04:30:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-22T06:23:00-04:00", "author": "http://www.crainscleveland.com/staff/41"}, "verify-v1": "Q00KiEdlx7oJ8JL4E1sfoHDh6tgQLZQyOh8A1oVCsIs=", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, minimal-ui"}, "article_summary": "But there are many other things the Affordable Care Act set within its goals \u201cthat we aren\u2019t quite there yet,\u201d she said.\nThat\u2019s one of the law\u2019s more notable accomplishments, said Lori Maite, Columbus-based executive director in Ernst & Young\u2019s national Affordable Care Act practice.\nNow that\u2019s a second part of what the Affordable Care Act is trying to do, and that\u2019s probably the place where it has had the most difficulty.\u201dAnd the solution is?\n\u201cHealth insurance isn\u2019t set up to keep people healthy.\n\u201cAnd as a result, we\u2019re not changing the health care expenditure curve at all,\u201d Ryan said."}
