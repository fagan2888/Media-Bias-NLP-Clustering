Eleven-year-old McKenzie Carey uses a \u201cprop,\u201d who serves as her support system on stage at all times: her 50-year-old dad, Mike Carey. McKenzie was born with the debilitating genetic disorder mitochondrial disease, which left her wheelchair-bound but hasn't stopped her on the road to becoming a beauty pageant queen.\n\n\"I just took the stage and was joking around,\" Carey told the NY Daily News. \"I said, 'Leave it up to me and I'll give her the best chance possible to win the pageant. I put her on the stage and did a wheelie, spun her around, and did a dance. The crowd went crazy.\u201d Mike helped his daughter perform this routine after she won a local pageant that qualified for a state competition that included a talent portion.\n\nMcKenzie started her career in beauty pageants with the help of her mother, Tammy Carey, who always entered her daughter in local pageants to show her daughter could still participate in events with other children. Mike has been performing with his daughter since 2010 and has competed in a dozen pageants every year. Needless to say, McKenzie and her family have not let her illness define who she is.\n\nThe 12-year-old was diagnosed with mitochondrial disease when she was 18 months old, The Huffington Post reported. Mitochondria are responsible for creating more than 90 percent of the energy needed by the body to maintain life and support growth, according to the United Mitochondrial Disease Foundation. Due to her condition, McKenzie\u2019s body is not able to reproduce cells, and therefore she suffers from a severe lack of energy and the ability to perform many tasks.\n\nMcKenzie\u2019s dad is happy to help his daughter with her beauty pageants and was unaware of the effect he had on the audience. The proud father noted people have donated McKenzie dresses, makeup, and other items. The family has set up a GoFundMe site to raise $1 million to pay for alternative therapies for McKenzie since treatment can only alleviate, or slow down the progression, but not cure the disease. The Careys aspire to travel outside the country to expand their treatment options.\n\n\u201cWe're just regular people trying to do something nice for our daughter,\u201d Carey said.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "mitochondrial disease, special needs daughter, wheel-chair bound, beauty pageant, mike carey, mckenzie carey", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Mike Carey and his special needs daughter, McKenzie Carey, win the hearts of millions with an elaborate dance routine performed at a recent beauty pageant on stage.", "title": "Father And Special Needs Daughter Share Beauty Pageant Dance On Stage [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/father-daughter-dance-wins-hearts-dad-leads-special-needs-girl-pageant-performance-290170", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/26/father-dancing-special-needs-daughter-beauty-pageant.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Mike Carey and his special needs daughter, McKenzie Carey, win the hearts of millions with an elaborate dance routine performed at a recent beauty pageant on stage.", "title": "Father And Special Needs Daughter Share Beauty Pageant Dance On Stage [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/father-daughter-dance-wins-hearts-dad-leads-special-needs-girl-pageant-performance-290170", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/26/father-dancing-special-needs-daughter-beauty-pageant.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/26/father-dancing-special-needs-daughter-beauty-pageant.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2014-06-26T16:21:15-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-26T16:21:14-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Mike Carey and his special needs daughter, McKenzie Carey, win the hearts of millions with an elaborate dance routine performed at a recent beauty pageant on stage."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9dc6\"", "article_summary": "Eleven-year-old McKenzie Carey uses a \u201cprop,\u201d who serves as her support system on stage at all times: her 50-year-old dad, Mike Carey.\nThe 12-year-old was diagnosed with mitochondrial disease when she was 18 months old, The Huffington Post reported.\n\u201cWe're just regular people trying to do something nice for our daughter,\u201d Carey said.\nMany little girls enter beauty pageants in hopes to win, with the support of their family and friends in the audience.\nMcKenzie\u2019s dad is happy to help his daughter with her beauty pageants and was unaware of the effect he had on the audience."}
