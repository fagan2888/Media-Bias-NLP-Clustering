Texas Sen. Ted Cruz spoke at a rally Sunday in Nashua for state Rep. Marilinda Garcia, just two days before she competes in the Republican primary for the 2nd Congressional District.

Cruz spoke about immigration, health care and defending the Constitution. He drew applause from the nearly 200 Garcia supporters at City Hall.

“I want to introduce you to the star of the hour to the next congresswoman from the state of New Hampshire, Marilinda Garcia,” Cruz said.

Garcia, 31, has drawn criticism from her opponents on being soft on immigration and the Affordable Care Act. Cruz dismissed the criticism.

“Marilinda Garcia will stand and fight against President Obama’s amnesty and stand and fight to repeal Obamacare,” he said.

One of Garcia’s two opponents, Gary Lambert, said the endorsement from Cruz means little.

“No matter what Sen. Cruz may say, it’s clear what Rep. Garcia has said. She wants a pathway to citizenship. She said that in the sponsored resolution with the National Hispanic Caucus of State Legislators,” Lambert said.

Lambert joined supporters in Nashua to watch the New England Patriots’ season opener.

Jim Lawrence, the other Republican competing in the primary, was in Concord.

“The voters are understanding that now I’m the only Republican candidate that can unite the party to defeat Rep. Annie Kuster,” Lawrence said.

Garcia’s sights seemed set on November.

“Now we’re just trying to look forward. Seems I’ll have some success Tuesday. I appreciate everyone who has supported me, and we want to pick up right Wednesday morning and move forward,” Garcia said.

Cruz also attended events in Manchester and Concord.
