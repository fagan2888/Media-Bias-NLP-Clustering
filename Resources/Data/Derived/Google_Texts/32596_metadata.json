Reuters\n\nJASON BORDOFF: As the U.S. summer holiday season comes to a close, motorists may find their wallets in better shape than in recent years thanks to a spectacular plunge in oil prices to 6 \u00bd year lows. Driven by a surge in US supply and OPEC\u2019s refusal to cut production, prices dropped 60% from June 2014 to January 2015. They spiked again to $66, before plunging nearly 40% from their 2015 high in May. The oil price collapse caused gasoline prices to drop more than one dollar from June 2014 to August 2015, boosting consumers\u2019 spending power by more than $100 a month. Yet while lower prices are a boon to the U.S. economy and motorists, consumers may be in for a bumpy ride.\n\nAfter years of adjusting oil production to influence crude prices, OPEC has seemingly given up its role of market stabilizer after top producer Saudi Arabia opted to increase its production to near capacity and increase market share in the face of falling prices. For years, the Kingdom had been the only country that produced significantly less oil than it economically could, and was thus the only one with any meaningful level of \u201cspare capacity\u201d\u2014the ability to quickly bring new oil supply onto the market to compensate for production losses elsewhere. The U.S. Energy Information Administration now estimates OPEC\u2019s total spare capacity at less than 1.3 million barrels a day, the lowest level since 2008.\n\nWithout that buffer, the oil market no longer has the same backstop to fill unexpected disruptions\u2014although high inventory levels will help for a while. The threat of such events may be even higher now due to the current lower oil price environment, which has threatened the domestic stability of some major oil exporters. A new study by Columbia University\u2019s Center on Global Energy Policy, for example, finds a far greater risk of macroeconomic and political turmoil in Venezuela following the oil price rout.\n\nU.S. shale oil production can be ramped up and down relatively quickly, leading some to suggest that the U.S. could act as the world\u2019s new \u201cswing supplier,\u201d providing price stability by bringing new oil on to the market when prices spike and idling production when they fall. Yet U.S. shale oil output has taken much longer to respond to the lower price than anyone anticipated, as producers increase efficiency and reduce costs. Output has barely budged, although it will likely decline next year. By contrast, OPEC can hike or reduce exports in a matter of weeks. Changes in U.S. output are the result of thousands of independent economic decisions by producers, not a single policy decision, as well as by capital markets\u2019 willingness to finance shale oil production.\n\nWhile demand is up in response to the price collapse, it too may play less of a balancing role moving forward. Policy and demographic shifts have lowered expected oil demand growth in the U.S. and Europe; the Chinese economy is shifting to less energy-intensive growth; and emerging markets may see a macroeconomic slowdown.\n\nWithout OPEC acting as a swing supplier, prices will need to drop low enough for long enough to curb uneconomic production and spur more usage (or, in the opposite scenario, rise high enough to incentivize more output and curb demand). The \u201cchoppy\u201d adjustment of production outside OPEC may lead to greater volatility at the pump. Price swings may be exacerbated by speculative investments in the oil market, although there remains significant debate on this point.\n\nHigh fuel price volatility is harmful to consumers because it undermines the ability of Americans to make longer-term financial decisions, such as where to live or what kind of car to buy. Consumers can often be shortsighted, as reflected in the surge in SUV sales this year, and quickly come to regret those moves if fuel prices move rapidly in the opposite direction. Unlike large users of oil like airlines, consumers cannot hedge their prices\u2014although some innovative firms are trying to create just such a product. Economic literature also finds that oil price volatility harms the economy more broadly as the uncertainty created can stymie consumption and investment.\n\nAs consumers cheer the cheapest driving they\u2019ve seen in six years, it would also be prudent to remember that what comes down must also go up\u2014now more than ever.\n\nJason Bordoff, a former energy adviser to President Obama, is a professor of professional practice in international and public affairs and founding director of the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "JASON BORDOFF: As the U.S. summer holiday season comes to a close, motorists may find their wallets in better shape than in recent years thanks to a spectacular plunge in oil prices to 6 \u00bd year lows.", "title": "Don\u2019t Get Used to Cheap Gas", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/experts/2015/09/18/dont-get-used-to-cheap-gas/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KE455_cmdoil_P_20150907075948.jpg"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "US", "article.headline": "Don\u2019t Get Used to Cheap Gas", "description": "JASON BORDOFF: As the U.S. summer holiday season comes to a close, motorists may find their wallets in better shape than in recent years thanks to a spectacular plunge in oil prices to 6 \u00bd year lows.", "article_section": "US", "author": "Charlie Wells", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "The Experts Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "The Experts", "article.summary": "JASON BORDOFF: As the U.S. summer holiday season comes to a close, motorists may find their wallets in better shape than in recent years thanks to a spectacular plunge in oil prices to 6 \u00bd year lows.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2015-09-18T09:36:53-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-158", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/experts/2015/09/18/dont-get-used-to-cheap-gas/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-258B-6177", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "US", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "JASON BORDOFF: As the U.S. summer holiday season comes to a close, motorists may find their wallets in better shape than in recent years thanks to a spectacular plunge in oil prices to 6 \u00bd year lows.", "title": "Don\u2019t Get Used to Cheap Gas", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/experts/2015/09/18/dont-get-used-to-cheap-gas/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KE455_cmdoil_P_20150907075948.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "The Experts", "article.id": "BL-258B-6177", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2015-09-18T12:00:09-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbbce\"", "article_summary": "Driven by a surge in US supply and OPEC\u2019s refusal to cut production, prices dropped 60% from June 2014 to January 2015.\nEconomic literature also finds that oil price volatility harms the economy more broadly as the uncertainty created can stymie consumption and investment.\nWithout that buffer, the oil market no longer has the same backstop to fill unexpected disruptions\u2014although high inventory levels will help for a while.\nPrice swings may be exacerbated by speculative investments in the oil market, although there remains significant debate on this point.\nThe threat of such events may be even higher now due to the current lower oil price environment, which has threatened the domestic stability of some major oil exporters."}
