Windsor, which struck down section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) as unconstitutional, the DOL announced the then-current definition of spouse under the FMLA allowed: Eligible employees could take leave under the FMLA to care for a same-sex spouse only if the employee resided in a state that recognized same-sex marriage.\n\nFebruary\u2019s Final Rule revises that definition by using a \u201cplace of celebration\u201d rule instead, which means the marriage must be recognized under the state law where the marriage took place so residency of the employee or the state of the employer doesn\u2019t matter. That means eligible employees in legal same-sex marriages can take FMLA leave \u2013 regardless of where they live.\n\nThe Rule also includes individuals in lawfully recognized same-sex and common law marriages and marriage validly entered into outside the US if they could have been entered into in at least one state.\n\nSame-Sex Spousal Rights\n\nAs a result of this change, eligible employees \u2013 regardless of where they live \u2013 can take:\n\nFMLA leave to care for their lawfully married same-sex spouse\n\nQualifying exigency leave due to their lawfully married same-sex spouse\u2019s covered military service\n\nMilitary caregiver leave for their lawfully married same-sex spouse\n\nFMLA leave to care for their stepchild (child of employee\u2019s same-sex spouse) regardless of the in loco parentis requirement\n\nFMLA leave to care for a stepparent who is a same-sex spouse of the employee\u2019s parent, regardless of whether the stepparent ever stood in loco parentis to the employee\n\nEffect on Employers\n\nThe DOL believes this definitional change will reduce the administrative burden on employers that operate in multiple states or have employees who move between states with different marriage recognition rules since those employers wouldn\u2019t have to consider the laws of the employee\u2019s state of residence in determining FMLA eligibility.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nEnjoy this post?
