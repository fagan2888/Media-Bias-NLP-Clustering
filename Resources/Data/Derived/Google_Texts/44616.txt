Itâ€™s hard to do more justice to the issue than what the Associated Press writes in its report:

Abandoning his pledge to act by the end of summer, President Barack Obama has decided to delay any executive action on immigration until after the November congressional elections, White House officials said.

The move is certain to infuriate immigration advocates while offering relief to some vulnerable Democrats in tough Senate re-election contests.

Two White House officials said Obama concluded that circumventing Congress through executive actions on immigration during the campaign would politicize the issue and hurt future efforts to pass a broad overhaul.

The story goes on to remind readers that the president promised in late June to immediately adopt the recommendations of cabinet officials he expected to have in his hands by the autumn equinox. The decision to delay action was reached in part to prevent poising the well for future immigration negotiations in Congress.

Not that the water is that clean to begin with.
