Presidential hopeful Marco Rubio was in Knoxville ahead of tomorrow's Super Tuesday elections. It's part of his 22 city push right before people head to the polls.

Rubio talked a lot about his conservative values and plans as president. He also told the audience Donald Trump is a liar who can't be trusted.

Governor Bill Haslam welcomed Florida Senator Marco rubio to east tennessee Monday. Rubio started off with a joke. Marco Rubio says, "39:29 this isn't a bad crowd to greet a gator."

Then quickly got to the point saying he would bring back a Reagan style military and he would repeal the affordable care act. Marco Rubio says, "We are here because we are fighting the future of the conservative movement."

Rubio said Trump is a con artist and can't be trusted. Marco Rubio says, "Donald Trump has made a career out of taking advantage of people's fears and anxieties."

Governor Bill Haslam told me after Rubio's speech that the Florida senator will unite America. Governor Bill Haslam says, "There are still a lot of primary delegates to be had and we do disservice if we say here's result already in the bag."

Senator Lamar Alexander said Rubio has a lot of support among senators and this is just the beginning of the game. Senator Lamar Alexander says, "Let the season run through. Rubio is doing well I've been in it before and they have the money to go all the way through until the end."

People who attended the Rubio rally said they like the senator's honesty. BK Hardin says, "I've been on the fence actually waited to vote but I believe I'm going to go for Rubio."

Lisa Frankewich says, "To be honest, I hadn't made up my mind until I did research when he was coming and I've been very impressed with what he has to offer."

Rubio left for Atlanta after Knoxville.
