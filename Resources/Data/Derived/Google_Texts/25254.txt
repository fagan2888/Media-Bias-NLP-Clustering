Editor's Note: In the video, analyst Michael Douglass incorrectly states that Afrezza had a previous Advisory Committee positive recommendation. Afrezza has not been before an Advisory Committee before this round. The Motley Fool and the analyst regret the error.

MannKind (NASDAQ:MNKD) has been on a tear since the beginning of the year, with the stock up over 50% year to date in large part due to a positive Advisory Committee recommendation for its inhaled insulin drug Afrezza. All eyes are now on the FDA, which has scheduled a Prescription Drug User Fee Action (PDUFA) date of July 15, 2014.

And if the FDA approves the drug, commercialization awaits. MannKind has not yet announced a marketing partner, and Pfizer's past difficulty marketing its own inhaled insulin, Exubera, is enough to give some investors pause.

In the video below, from Wednesday's edition of Where The Money Is, Motley Fool health care analyst Michael Douglass lays out why he is comfortable avoiding the stock for the time being.
