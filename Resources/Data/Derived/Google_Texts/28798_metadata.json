Perhaps, during his travels, he\u2019ll look through his tinted limousine\u2019s windows and notice that the country isn\u2019t doing quite as well as he claims.\n\nSenator Joni Ernst laid the groundwork for this potential awakening in her response to the State of the Union.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\n\u201cWe see our neighbors agonize over stagnant wages and lost jobs. We see the hurt caused by canceled healthcare plans and higher monthly insurance bills. We see too many moms and dads put their own dreams on hold while growing more fearful about the kind of future they\u2019ll be able to leave to their children,\u201d she said, explaining how the real situation in the heartland differs sharply from Obama\u2019s rosy, self-congratulatory rhetoric. \u201cAmericans have been hurting, but when we demanded solutions, too often Washington responded with the same stale mindset that led to failed policies like Obamacare. It\u2019s a mindset that gave us political talking points, not serious solutions.\u201d\n\nGrowing up, she noted, her mother would reuse everything, even wrapping old bread-bags around Ernst\u2019s shoes to protect them from the rain.\n\nHer assessment of bread-bag-slipper America made for an interesting contrast with the aimless grab bag of redistribution schemes and poll-tested rhetoric Obama referred to as \u201cmiddle-class economics.\u201d It was quickly discovered that the supposedly random ordinary woman Obama spotlighted as an example of middle America\u2019s gratitude for his wonderful policies was, in truth, a Democrat Party operative he\u2019s used as a human prop before. With Obamanomics, it\u2019s sock puppets all the way down.\n\nWhile Ernst outlined sharp policy differences with Obama on issues such as Keystone XL, foreign policy, ObamaCare, executive overreach, and abortion, she took the President up on his offer to work together on an issue he\u2019s supposedly interested in tackling: simplifying the tax code. Of course, when Obama says that, he doesn\u2019t really mean it \u2013 he wants to close a few \u201cloopholes\u201d that benefit constituencies he doesn\u2019t like, with an eye toward raking in more money for the government. Obama and his Party will never willingly surrender the enormous power a hyper-complicated tax code gives them to manipulate the economy, reprogram society, and reward their big-money supporters.\n\nErnst\u2019s Republican idea of tax reform was considerably more ambitious, although she stopped short of explicitly calling for reforms as dramatic as the Flat Tax or sales-only Fair Tax. \u201cLet\u2019s simplify America\u2019s outdated and loophole-ridden tax code,\u201d she urged. \u201cRepublicans think tax filing should be easier for you, not just the well-connected. So let\u2019s iron out loopholes to lower rates and create jobs, not pay for more government spending.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s bread-bag thinking in a nutshell: smaller government, bigger people. Obama doesn\u2019t come within a light-year of any proposal that would make the government smaller. Even when he kicks around the idea of middle-class tax relief, it\u2019s only for certain people he deems worthy, and he\u2019s careful to make plans for his beloved Leviathan State to recoup lost revenue by soaking others.\n\nEvery politician pays lip service to the idea that hard-working people who play by the rules should be able to get ahead. Ernst praised her parents and grandparents, who had \u201cvery little to call their own except the sweat on their brow and the dirt on their hands,\u201d for working and sacrificing to give her \u201csome truly extraordinary opportunities.\u201d She said all it takes to pursue those opportunities is \u201cthe freedom to dream big, and a whole lot of hard work.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t you dare dream too big, though, or Obama\u2019s Dream Police will scribble out a citation for greed in the first degree and begin seizing your income! The dreams of the Little People must be carefully regulated by their betters. Good luck getting a permit for anything they can\u2019t imagine\u2026 or anything that would compromise the ambitions of those with better connections. Don\u2019t try taking credit for the results of your own hard work, or you\u2019ll get a little speech about how You Didn\u2019t Build That.\n\nThe thing about Obama-style liberalism, even at its most sincere and least corrupt, is that it looks upon Ernst\u2019s account of hard-working parents sacrificing for their children and sees a horror story that must never be repeated. No one should have to work that hard, or sacrifice anything. Here, have some government-mandated sick leave, maternity leave, wage increases, child care\u2026 you\u2019ll feel better, provided you don\u2019t ask any tough questions about who\u2019s paying for all those mandatory benefits, or get any funny ideas about launching a venture that doesn\u2019t conform to the standards of politicians.\n\nThe \u201cmiddle class\u201d is a protean rhetorical construct guaranteed to produce the kind of divisiveness and bitterness Obama claimed he doesn\u2019t want. It\u2019s a broad concept that covers everything from highly-taxed professionals, to people who receive at least as much in government benefits as they pay in taxes. Everything done in the name of the Middle Class is automatically justified, no matter who it hurts, or who pays for it. The Middle Class is the only class we\u2019re supposed to aspire to. Nobody really wants to be poor, while aspiring to wealth is considered selfish.\n\nThis is all political claptrap peddled by those in search of power. Guaranteed comfort and managed outcomes require the compulsion of unwilling citizens. The pursuit of opportunity requires no such compulsion; as Ernst said, it\u2019s all about freedom, hard work, and sacrifice. Those resources are as essential to rich men and women as they are to paupers. Hundred-billion-dollar social programs are not needed to ensure the lawful equality of opportunity and honest effort.\n\nMiddle-classness is a function of independence, not income. The middle class combines great economic resources with political strength; it\u2019s a great body of people putting in a huge amount of work, producing an astonishing volume of wealth, and casting enough votes to thwart politicians with grandiose plans to pick their pockets. That\u2019s why the Left hates them, and wants to re-define middle-class life into something the State provides. You\u2019ll enjoy the ride through life, provided you remain in your assigned seat.\n\nAmerica is not made great by its government. Passive \u201chope for change\u201d is worth nothing compared to active effort. Our true recovery will not be a matter of pouring another $60 billion into the leaky administrative bucket of public education, which just happens to be a big Democrat political donor. Recovery will be delivered by people who want an education so badly that they\u2019ll go to school on rainy days with bread bags over their shoes to keep them dry. Such people have little patience for claims that they can\u2019t get ahead in life unless others are forced to buy things for them.", "article_metadata": {"description": "'Middle-Class Economics' vs. Bread-Bag America", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "'Middle-Class Economics' vs. Bread-Bag America", "title": "'Middle-Class Economics' vs. Bread-Bag America - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/01/Obama-Limo-file.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/01/22/middle-class-economics-vs-bread-bag-america/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "'Middle-Class Economics' vs. Bread-Bag America", "title": "'Middle-Class Economics' vs. Bread-Bag America - Breitbart", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/01/Obama-Limo-file.jpg", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Joni Ernst, Middle Class, Republican Party, State of the Union,Big Government,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "State of the Union", "published_time": "2015-01-22T07:56:58-07:00", "categories": "Big Government"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "The pursuit of opportunity requires no such compulsion; as Ernst said, it\u2019s all about freedom, hard work, and sacrifice.\nEverything done in the name of the Middle Class is automatically justified, no matter who it hurts, or who pays for it.\nObama doesn\u2019t come within a light-year of any proposal that would make the government smaller.\nThe Middle Class is the only class we\u2019re supposed to aspire to.\nThe \u201cmiddle class\u201d is a protean rhetorical construct guaranteed to produce the kind of divisiveness and bitterness Obama claimed he doesn\u2019t want."}
