Emmanuel Cleaver, D-Mo., had agreed to participate in its so-called Million Americans March Against Fear, Cleaver\u2019s office is saying that was a \u201cmiscommunication.\u201d\n\nIn an email, Cleaver legislative assistant Mary Petrovic wrote:\n\n\u201cThe Congressman is not speaking at the Million Americans March Against Fear in DC on 9/11.\n\n\u201c[March organizer] MD Rabbi Alam is a constituent of Missouri\u2019s Fifth District \u2013 and per his request \u2013 the Congressman was happy to meet with him in his Kansas City office last week.\n\n\u201cRegarding participation in and/or speaking at the march \u2014 I am not sure where the miscommunication took place.\u201d\n\nHowever the \u201cmiscommunication\u201d took place, it must have been a doozy. The Facebook posting about Cleaver\u2019s participation doesn\u2019t leave any room for doubt. Here\u2019s a screen shot of the American Political Committee\u2019s Facebook announcement:\n\nAlam was not available for comment Wednesday. Numerous attempts to reach him and other representatives of the Million Americans March were unsuccessful.\n\nCleaver Communications Director Michele Rooney could not be reached to explain why her office failed to issue a correction in response to the announcement. In an interview Monday with the Clarion Project website, she said, \u201cAs for participation in the Million American March Against Fear on 9/11 in Washington D.C.\u2014the Congressman is not participating in the event.\u201d\n\nIn an interview for the same article, however, Alam maintained Cleaver was coming.\n\n\u201cWe reached him and invited him. It is as simple as this. Congressman Cleaver knows me professionally and he knows us. We are real, not like you know me from Fox news or from some \u2026 Islamo-phobic sources. Do not forget, your media always lied about me and my people and my group. Congressman Cleaver accepted our invitation to be speaking at our event on 9/11.\u201d\n\nSo, on one side you have a group of Islamic \u201ctruthers\u201d who maintain Muslims weren\u2019t responsible for the 9/11 attacks. On the other you have an office that let incorrect information about a United States congressman\u2019s speaking schedule on one of the most important calendar days of the year stay in the public domain for days on end without correcting it.\n\nIt\u2019s worth remembering that this is the same congressman\u2019s office that allowed the false claim that he was purposely spat upon by an anti-Obamacare protester in Washington in March of 2010 to linger in the media for days.\n\nWas that \u201cmiscommunication\u201d too?\n\nUPDATE: Cleaver Communications Director Michele Rooney called a little after 5 to emphasize that neither Rep. Cleaver nor his staff had committed to be part of the march on Wednesday. When Cleaver spoke with Alam last week, Alam asked if the congressman would be available and was told to give the information about the event to Cleaver\u2019s staff.\n\nApparently, he never followed through.\n\nAnd for an event like 9/11, a congressman\u2019s schedule is set well before a week beforehand anyway. As Petrovic wrote in her email: \u201cI do know that neither of the Congressman\u2019s schedulers (in DC or in KC) were ever made aware of this event, nor were they asked about the Congressman\u2019s availability for participation. They have had the Congressman scheduled on 9/11 for numerous events, observances, and remembrances for many weeks in advance.\u201d\n\nSo it\u2019s the \u201ctruthers\u201d that seem to have a problem with the truth here after all.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.4.3", "og": {"site_name": "BizPac Review", "description": "Days after the American Muslim Political Action Committee announced on its Facebook page in no uncertain terms that U.S. Rep.
