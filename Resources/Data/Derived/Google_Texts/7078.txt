The Obama administration has moved one step closer to releasing the man once suspected of being Osama bin Laden’s bodyguard from Gitmo.

After being captured in the mountains of Tora Bora in 2002, Yemeni foot soldier Saeed Sarem Jarabh was classified by the Bush administration as a “forever detainee” — one too dangerous for release, but with insufficient evidence to prosecute.

But after sitting in the Guantanamo Bay detention camp all these years, a federal parole board now considers the terrorist to be a “low-level” fighter, Fox News reported.

According to Fox News chief intelligence correspondent Catherine Herridge, analysts believe the White House is willing to accept greater risks as it rushes to empty the detention camp and shut it down before Obama leaves office.

The Defense Intelligence Agency said the terror recidivism rate among Guantanamo transfers is at 18 percent over the last 4-5 years.

With the success of Obamacare wavering and facing a potential deathblow by the Supreme Court this summer, President Obama desperately wants to reach nuclear deal with Iran and close the detention camp at Guantanamo Bay to help shore up his legacy.

And while negotiations with Iran take up much of the president’s focus, the effort to reduce the population at Gitmo continues in earnest, according to Herridge.

Herridge said there are about 122 detainees still housed at Gitmo, with 50 cleared for transfer.

“The conventional wisdom now is that if the administration can get the population in these camps below 100, it will be easier to make the case to remove everyone who remains to the United States,” she said.
