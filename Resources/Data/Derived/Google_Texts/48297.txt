Ever the crack military analyst, Lt. Col. Oliver North predicted that the Russians will kill famed National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden and pin the murder on the United States.

“Edward Snowden is in the hands of the Russian intelligence services. Everyone he meets every day with is a Russian intelligence agent,” North said Tuesday on the Fox News show, “Markets Now.” “They’re all asking the questions: ‘How do the Americans do this? Can we do this? How do we protect ourselves from what you’re doing? How do we penetrate things like the American data system for, let’s say, the Affordable Care Act?’ And at the end of the day, what will happen is the Russians will kill Edward Snowden. And we will be blamed for it.”

Given Russian President Vladimir Putin’s momentum in the Middle East and the tenuous relationship between the Obama administration and the Russians, prospects don’t look good, for Snowden or America. Snowden’s death would benefit Russia, North said. He also offered this advice to Secretary of State John Kerry:

“And the reason they’ll kill him is because they don’t want us to know how much he gave away. This is a very, very serious problem. And what Mr. Kerry really ought to be doing is traveling to Moscow to see if he can convince Edward Snowden’s dad to get the kid back home to face the music because the Russians will kill him.”

When asked about Obama’s handling of intelligence matters and the NSA scandal, North said the president hasn’t done his job well in either case.

“I don’t think this president has handled anything in regards to national security in this country well.”
