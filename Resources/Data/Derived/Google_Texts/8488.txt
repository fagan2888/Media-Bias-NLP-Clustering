The Islamic State terrorist group said one of its militants on Friday detonated a suicide bomb at the funeral procession of a pro-government Shi’ite Muslim fighter in Baghdad, Iraq, killing at least 18 people and wounding 41.

The Sunni militant group said in an online statement that its target was a “group of rejectionist Hashid,” a term used by the Islamic State to refer to the Shi’ite militias combatting them in the country’s north and west, Reuters reported.

The Friday bombing comes on the heels of a pair of suicide bombings in Beirut that the group has also claimed responsibility for. The twin bombs that detonated just minutes apart in a Hezbollah-controlled refugee camp in Lebanon killed as many as 41 and wounded hundreds.

The responsibility claims have not been verified officially.
