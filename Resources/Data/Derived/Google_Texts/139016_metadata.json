Car and SUV sales in the country declined 5.3% to about 1.64 million units during the April to November period.\n\n\u201cIt will benefit the industry,\u201d by creating demand said Sugato Sen, deputy director general of SIAM told the Wall Street Journal. \u201cThe industry has been demanding it for a long time.\u201d\n\nIt remains to be seen whether the finance ministry\u2013which is already facing a severe cash crunch\u2013will give its nod to the proposal. But if it passes, drivers hope it will mean fewer tired trucks and broken buses blocking traffic along India\u2019s already overburdened highways.\n\nFollow India Real Time on Twitter @WSJIndia.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "India may launch its own cash-for-clunkers scheme to encourage drivers to retire rickety vehicles, but it\u2019s not going to pay for your old Ambassador or Padmini just yet.", "title": "Cash for Clunkers Comes to India", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2013/12/23/cash-for-clunkers-comes-to-india/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-AW381_itruck_G_20131223062953.jpg"}, "site": "WSJIndia", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "World", "article.headline": "Cash for Clunkers Comes to India", "description": "India may launch its own cash-for-clunkers scheme to encourage drivers to retire rickety vehicles, but it\u2019s not going to pay for your old Ambassador or Padmini just yet.", "article_section": "World", "author": "WSJ Staff", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "India Real Time Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "India Real Time", "article.summary": "India may launch its own cash-for-clunkers scheme to encourage drivers to retire rickety vehicles, but it\u2019s not going to pay for your old Ambassador or Padmini just yet.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2013-12-23T11:33:07-05:00", "dj.asn": "10-140", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2013/12/23/cash-for-clunkers-comes-to-india/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-IRTB-21926", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "World", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "India may launch its own cash-for-clunkers scheme to encourage drivers to retire rickety vehicles, but it\u2019s not going to pay for your old Ambassador or Padmini just yet.", "title": "Cash for Clunkers Comes to India", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2013/12/23/cash-for-clunkers-comes-to-india/", "image": {"width": 553, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-AW381_itruck_G_20131223062953.jpg", "height": 369}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "India Real Time", "article.id": "BL-IRTB-21926", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2013-12-23T11:36:58-05:00"}, "article_summary": "\u201cIt will have a spin-off benefit in terms of the environment, employment and \u200eboosting manufacturing,\u201d the trade ministry official said.\nThe trade ministry\u2019s department of industrial policy and promotion has recently sent the proposal to the finance ministry for its approval.\nDetails such as the exact size of the incentive scheme and the ways it would be distributed will be worked out after approval from the finance ministry, he said.\nWhile India\u2019s trade ministry is considering launching an old vehicle buyback program similar to a popular program in the U.S. in 2009, for now it is only considering the program for old trucks and buses.\nBut if it passes, drivers hope it will mean fewer tired trucks and broken buses blocking traffic along India\u2019s already overburdened highways."}
