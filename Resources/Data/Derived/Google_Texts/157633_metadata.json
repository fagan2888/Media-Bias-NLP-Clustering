The wide-ranging estimates depend on how many patients are treated and how much the drugs are discounted by manufacturers.\n\nCharles Bacchi, president and CEO of the association, said the report underscores what is to come in the near future when more costly prescription drugs are approved. The high costs aren\u2019t sustainable for health plans, consumers or taxpayers, Bacchi said.\n\n\u201cWith a slew of new high-priced drugs set to hit the market this year \u2026 this report really shows how that number can be multiplied,\u201d Bacchi said. \u201cIt could be a huge hit to the taxpayers.\u201d\n\nThe new hepatitis C medications are a vast improvement over previous treatments and can cure patients. But their staggering cost has prompted a national debate about their outsized bite into health care budgets. The estimated costs have led to policy changes, hearings, lawsuits and ethical debates about who should receive the treatments.\n\nAn estimated 3.2 million people nationwide have hepatitis C, a virus that is the leading cause of cirrhosis and liver cancer.\n\nGilead Sciences Inc., which won approval for the drug Sovaldi in 2013, has been criticized for charging about $1,000 for each pill \u2013 or about $84,000 for the 12-week treatment. Another of its drugs, Harvoni, costs more.\n\nGilead has said the prices are fair because the drugs are highly effective and can prevent future medical costs to treat liver disease or provide transplants.\n\nOne study last year by the nonprofit Institute for Clinical & Economic Review found that if half of hepatitis C-infected Californians received the new medications, annual drug costs could rise by $22 billion.\n\n\u201cThese cures are not free, \u201c said Steven Pearson, president of the Boston-based institute.\n\nHealth officials in most Medicaid programs around the country are prioritizing who receives the hepatitis C medication, according to a study published Tuesday in the Annals of Internal Medicine. The high costs are \u201cforcing many payers to ration this lifesaving treatment,\u201d the study said.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s Department of Health Care Services issued a new policy, effective Wednesday, which sets new guidelines on which patients can receive state-funded hepatitis C treatment. The department estimates that between 3,000 to 4,000 Medi-Cal members will seek treatment next year and says that decisions about who gets the new medications will be based upon medical necessity rather than cost.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s budget, which was signed last week, allotted $228 million in additional funds for specialty drugs to treat hepatitis C patients in the state hospitals and prisons and on state programs such as Medi-Cal. Covered California, the state\u2019s health care marketplace, recently approved a cap on specialty drugs that would limit most consumers to paying $250 per month per prescription.\n\nThe state has convened a working group to review the state\u2019s policies and expenditures on high-cost drugs, including those used to treat hepatitis C.\n\nHepatitis C medications have triggered more discussion about drug development, pricing and use than any drugs in recent history, and the debate is far from over, Pearson said.\n\n\u201cA lot of new expensive drugs are on the horizon,\u201d Pearson said, referring to treatments for various conditions. \u201cDrug costs could go up significantly and have a major impact on the budgets.\u201d\n\nTwo costly medications \u2014 one for high cholesterol and one for heart disease \u2014 are expected to get FDA approval later this summer. Cancer drugs in the pipeline could have similarly high price tags.\n\nThe hepatitis C research was done by The Taylor Feldman Group for the health plan association, which seeks to raise awareness of the cost to taxpayers, health plans and consumers, Bacchi said. He noted that private health plans handle the vast majority of Medi-Cal patients through managed care.\n\nEmalie Huriaux, director of federal and state programs for Project Inform, a patient advocacy group based in San Francisco, was skeptical of the findings.\n\nThe report is \u201cbased on a lot of assumptions that can\u2019t be verified,\u201d she said.\n\nShe said insurers and pharmaceutical companies are \u201cthrowing rocks at each other\u201d rather than coming up with solutions to the high prices. The report, she said, is another example of that.\n\nHuriaux said something has to be done to lower costs, reduce restrictions and improve access for consumers, many of whom have lived with the hepatitis C virus for decades yet have been told they aren\u2019t sick enough to get the medications.\n\n\u201cIt comes down to how much should you pay for a cure?\u201d she said. \u201cGiving people access shouldn\u2019t bankrupt the public systems and it shouldn\u2019t break individual\u2019s bank accounts.\u201d\n\nBlue Shield of California Foundation helps fund KHN coverage in California.\n\nKaiser Health News (KHN) is a nonprofit national health policy news service.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Analysis says paying for high-priced drugs in prisons, state hospitals and Medi-Cal could cost billions..", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Insurers Predict Hepatitis C Drugs to Take Huge Toll on California Budget\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2015\\/07\\/01\\/insurers-predict-hepatitis-c-drugs-to-take-huge-toll-on-california-budget\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-07-01 10:28:58\",\"mod_date\":\"2015-07-01 10:29:35\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":42678,\"author_id\":\"80\",\"author_name\":\"Jon Brooks\",\"author_display_name\":\"Jon Brooks\",\"tags\":[],\"categories\":[\"Tests &amp; Treatments\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2015\\/07\\/HepC.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "Analysis says paying for high-priced drugs in prisons, state hospitals and Medi-Cal could cost billions..", "title": "Insurers Predict Hepatitis C Drugs to Take Huge Toll on California Budget", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2015/07/01/insurers-predict-hepatitis-c-drugs-to-take-huge-toll-on-california-budget/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2015/07/HepC.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Insurers Predict Hepatitis C Drugs to Take Huge Toll on California BudgetCalifornia taxpayers could be on the hook for billions of dollars to treat hepatitis C patients in various state-funded programs, according to a report released Tuesday by an insurers\u2019 trade group.\n\u201cIt could be a huge hit to the taxpayers.\u201dThe new hepatitis C medications are a vast improvement over previous treatments and can cure patients.\nAn estimated 3.2 million people nationwide have hepatitis C, a virus that is the leading cause of cirrhosis and liver cancer.\nCalifornia\u2019s Department of Health Care Services issued a new policy, effective Wednesday, which sets new guidelines on which patients can receive state-funded hepatitis C treatment.\nCalifornia\u2019s budget, which was signed last week, allotted $228 million in additional funds for specialty drugs to treat hepatitis C patients in the state hospitals and prisons and on state programs such as Medi-Cal."}
