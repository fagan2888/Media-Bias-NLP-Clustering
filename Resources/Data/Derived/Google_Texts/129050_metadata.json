The sides of the theatre are lined with what looks like a theatrical set decoration of \u201cmission-style\u201d Spanish villas, while the ceiling is done in mock-up of the night sky. This night, May 1, 2016, no good NPR listener is absent from the audience as author and comedian David Sedaris came to the Arlington to read selected essays and generally muse about the state of the culture.\n\nFor those who don\u2019t know Sedaris, he is famous for his autobiographical stories and essays detailing his life as a persnickety, middle-class gay man who grew up in Raleigh, North Carolina. Sedaris garnered acclaim throughout the late \u201890s and 2000s for his collections of essays, such as Naked and Me Talk Pretty One Day among others, in addition to being a fixture at the New Yorker.\n\nCommencing the event on Sunday were representatives from the UCSB Arts & Lectures series, proud to announce that Sedaris, a staple of the A&L gallery, would be returning for the 2016-2017 season. A wave of relief swept through the gluten-free crowd at this declaration. Before Sedaris himself took the stage, the MCs listed his accomplishments and promoted his upcoming essay collection Death by Finding. They also announced his American Sign-Language translator Amy Mass (for this crowd, any slight to the differently abled would be a grievous shock).\n\nFinally, Sedaris walked on. And then he left. Not wordlessly \u2014 he began by declaring that he\u2019s wearing culottes, explaining his knee-length, baggy trousers to dispel the audience\u2019s chuckles. He also told the audience how every touring season he likes to promote a book, and this year he chose the nonfictional recounting of a murder investigation Ghettoside by Jill Leovy. Then he invited her to come on stage and share from her book. Leovy professed her gratitude for Sedaris before recounting what led her to chronicle an L.A. homicide investigation. She told the theater patrons how the U.S.\u2019s astounding rates of murder for a developed nation are concentrated among urban black communities. The quinoa-loving listeners were likely very familiar with these ideas. But Leovy spoke of her acquaintance with the homicide detective in a humanizing way that promised a rich narrative.\n\nFinally, Leovy ushered Sedaris back on. Over the course of the night, the essayist read two of his stories, A Modest Proposal and A House Divided. A House Divided tells of the humorist and his family\u2019s dealing with the aftermath of his sister Tiffany\u2019s suicide. It\u2019s a personal story steeped in the milieu of suburban North Carolina.\n\nA Modest Proposal, alluding to the Jonathan Swift essay of the same name (and combining it with a pun on the word \u201cproposal\u201d), recounts Sedaris\u2019s reaction to the recent Supreme Court ruling legalizing gay marriage. The story punctures the veneer of political correctness truly for the first time when Sedaris describes volunteering to pick up trash along a highway, where he encounters \u201ca strap-on penis.\u201d It was nice to hear an audience of refined, Fox News-disdaining socialites laugh at a dirty joke. Sedaris continued from there, marveling at how a three-inch strap-on \u201cnot much bigger around than a Vienna sausage\u201d could satisfy someone. It was an important moment: There\u2019s not much difference really between the coastal, cosmopolitan, Jon Stewart watchers and the provincial masses they supposedly have so much mutual animosity to. There\u2019s a myth of snooty, upturned-noses directed at lowbrow, Jeff Foxworthy-style humor, but even NPR-listeners love a good dick joke. There was no love lost when Sedaris described the people who\u2019ve spent the last decade opposing gay marriage as \u201cthose assholes.\u201d He turned it around when he brought up Ghettoside again near the end of the show, telling about how his preconceptions of the white, Republican homicide detectives were challenged upon learning how much empathy the officer has for members of the poverty-stricken black community he finds himself in.\n\nOther highlights of the performance lie in Sedaris\u2019s reading aloud of his personal diary. Noteworthy is his depiction of a vulgar Phyllis Diller, who says things like \u201cNancy Reagan was known for her blowjobs.\u201d Sedaris also told of meeting someone who took mushrooms before going to the Anne Frank House and described Charleston as a city \u201cmore than a little pleased with itself.\u201d\n\nBut politics can\u2019t be avoided. When an audience member asked Sedaris if he has any opinions on the current election cycle, he claimed he prefers to leave political commentary to others. When he told of a man on an airplane struggling with an overhead compartment who said \u201cThis is broken, just like Obamacare,\u201d he did so mockingly, eliciting some laughs and cheers from the audience. But when Sedaris lavishly described his subsequent feeling of disdain, he was mocking that too.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Daily Nexus", "description": "No good NPR listener was absent from the audience as author and comedian David Sedaris came to the Arlington to read selected essays and generally muse about the state of the culture.", "title": "David Sedaris Brings Literary Laughs to Arlington", "url": "http://dailynexus.com/2016-05-05/david-sedaris-brings-literary-laughs-to-arlington/", "image": "http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/davidsedaris-1-e1462439415472.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "No good NPR listener was absent from the audience as author and comedian David Sedaris came to the Arlington to read selected essays and generally muse about the state of the culture.", "title": "David Sedaris Brings Literary Laughs to Arlington", "url": "http://dailynexus.com/2016-05-05/david-sedaris-brings-literary-laughs-to-arlington/", "image": "http://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/davidsedaris-1-e1462439415472.png?fit=800%2C373", "site": "@dailynexus", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "description": "No good NPR listener was absent from the audience as author and comedian David Sedaris came to the Arlington to read selected essays and generally muse about", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/cropped-new-logo.png?fit=270%2C270"}, "article_summary": "Before Sedaris himself took the stage, the MCs listed his accomplishments and promoted his upcoming essay collection Death by Finding.\nLeovy professed her gratitude for Sedaris before recounting what led her to chronicle an L.A. homicide investigation.\nSedaris continued from there, marveling at how a three-inch strap-on \u201cnot much bigger around than a Vienna sausage\u201d could satisfy someone.\nWhen an audience member asked Sedaris if he has any opinions on the current election cycle, he claimed he prefers to leave political commentary to others.\nOver the course of the night, the essayist read two of his stories, A Modest Proposal and A House Divided."}
