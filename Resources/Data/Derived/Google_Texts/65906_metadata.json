I've seen rattlesnakes. I've seen all sorts of animals,\" said Raymond Baran.\n\nHe's lived in the city for 22 years, but something he saw this week caught him off guard.\n\nHe was driving to work early one morning when he saw a coyote.\n\n\"It wasn't a cat, and it didn't look like a dog until I hit the high beams on him. I realized it wasn't a fox; it was definitely a coyote.\"\n\nThe sighting is making neighbors uncomfortable.\n\n\"I'd like to see somebody come in and... I don't know what they can do about it; we took over their habitat so...\" said John Jones.\n\nFWC said coyotes pose very little risk to humans, but people should still keep a close eye on small children and pets when outside.\n\n\"You gotta have more responsibility with your pets, and if you can't defend yourself, you can't defend your pet,\" Baran said.\n\nHe has several reasons to be concerned. FWC said they've received six complaints since July in Cape Coral.\n\n\"It's gonna become a nuisance if it becomes neglected, but then again who has more right, the animal or the people who are invading their space?\" Baran asked.\n\nFWC representatives said coyotes aren't protected, but any population control methods are ineffective.\n\nLast week, Cape police said a group of eight large, healthy coyotes have been identified as living in the neighborhood where Baran lives, off Embers Parkway. Police said residents in the area of Embers between Burnt Store Road and El Dorado Boulevard should be on alert.\n\nIn July, ABC7 reported residents in southwest Cape reported seeing a coyote trot through some yards.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "Cape Coral is known for many things, and coyotes could now be added to the list.T his after reports of a coyote attacking a pet Yorkie on Thanksgiving\u00a0at a home off Pine Island Road.", "og": {"url": "http://www.abc-7.com/story/30732937/reports-of-coyotes-leave-cape-coral-residents-uneasy", "image": "http://ftpcontent.worldnow.com/wncustom/custom/wzvn/wzvn_og_image.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Cape Coral is known for many things, and coyotes could now be added to the list.T his after reports of a coyote attacking a pet Yorkie on Thanksgiving\u00a0at a home off Pine Island Road.", "title": "Reports of coyotes leave Cape Coral residents uneasy"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://WZVN.images.worldnow.com/images/9448354_G.jpg", "description": "Cape Coral is known for many things, and coyotes could now be added to the list.T his after reports of a coyote attacking a pet Yorkie on Thanksgiving\u00a0at a home off Pine Island Road.", "card": "summary", "title": "Reports of coyotes leave Cape Coral residents uneasy"}, "wnreadableurl": "reports-of-coyotes-leave-cape-coral-residents-uneasy", "ROBOTS": "index,follow,noarchive", "date": "2015/12/12", "fb": {"admins": 1851799707, "app_id": 1678378052403648}, "owner": "WZVN", "google-site-verification": "gcWGJ_5HBMygrFxFQLREn-pvEzLmkYG-FQepn2WoVSk", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS29"}, "article_summary": "In July, ABC7 reported residents in southwest Cape reported seeing a coyote trot through some yards.\nCape residents will be the first to tell you their city is full of wildlife.\nLast week, Cape police said a group of eight large, healthy coyotes have been identified as living in the neighborhood where Baran lives, off Embers Parkway.\nCape Coral is known for many things, and coyotes could now be added to the list.\nHe's lived in the city for 22 years, but something he saw this week caught him off guard."}
