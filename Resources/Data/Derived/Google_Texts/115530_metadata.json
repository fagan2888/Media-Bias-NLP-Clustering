The forum is scheduled from 5:30 to 8 p.m.\n\nTom Matsuda, implementation manager of the Affordable Care Act in Hawaii, and Coral Andrews, executive director of the Hawaii Health Connector, Hawaii\u2019s new online health insurance marketplace, will be the main presenters.\n\nJoining them will be state lawmakers from West Hawaii including Sen. Josh Green, a physician who will take part in a panel discussion with the ACA officials.\n\nThe event will be preceded by a briefing on the Hawaii Health Connector by various state agencies to be held this Wednesday at the state Capitol.\n\nThe Hawaii Health Connector , which was launched on Oct. 1, took in more than 1,000 applications for health insurance in its first few days of operations despite software problems that did not allow consumers to compare plans.\n\nState officials said the comparisons of the plans being offered should be available by the end of the month.\n\n\u201cWe continue to work collaboratively with both our state partners and health insurers to make certain that consumers will have access to accurate plan and rate information in a secure online marketplace,\u201d Executive Director Andrews said in a statement. \u201cLike many health marketplaces across the nation, we are working in earnest to add functionality in the coming days and weeks. When it comes to a family\u2019s or small business\u2019s budget and health care, we are focused on getting it right.\u201d\n\nThe connector\u2019s six-month open enrollment period runs through March 31. However, consumers must sign up by Dec. 15 to obtain insurance coverage that begins Jan. 1.\n\nThe state\u2019s two largest health insurers, Hawaii Medical Service Association and Kaiser Permanente Hawaii, were the only companies to sign on to the exchange which was established in each state under the Affordable Care Act, which is also known as \u201cObamacare.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"expires": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "The forum featuring key officials in the Affordable Care Act in Hawaii will be held on Oct. 15 in the Old Airport Pavilion.", "og": {"url": "http://bigislandnow.com/2013/10/07/forum-in-kona-next-week-on-aca-health-care-plans/", "site_name": "Big Island Now  |  Forum in Kona Next Week on ACA Health Care Plans", "image": "http://bigislandnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Old_Kona_Airport_Pavillion-wiki-e1381176463210-1024x594.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Big Island Now: Forum in Kona Next Week on ACA Health Care Plans"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f01d4f", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://bigislandnow.com/wp-content/themes/BigIslandNow2015/library/images/win8-tile-icon.png", "keywords": "hawaii health connector,affordable health care act,obamacare,kona aca public forum,aca panel discussion,old kona airport health care forum,hmsa,kaiser permanente hawaii,featured articles,news,west hawaii news", "theme-color": "#57ace2"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf3cc\"", "article_summary": "Key officials in Hawaii\u2019s implementation of the Affordable Care Act will host a community health care forum on Tuesday, Oct. 15, at the Makaeo Pavilion at the Old Airport Park.\nThe forum is scheduled from 5:30 to 8 p.m.Tom Matsuda, implementation manager of the Affordable Care Act in Hawaii, and Coral Andrews, executive director of the Hawaii Health Connector, Hawaii\u2019s new online health insurance marketplace, will be the main presenters.\nWhen it comes to a family\u2019s or small business\u2019s budget and health care, we are focused on getting it right.\u201dThe connector\u2019s six-month open enrollment period runs through March 31.\nThe event will be preceded by a briefing on the Hawaii Health Connector by various state agencies to be held this Wednesday at the state Capitol.\nThe Hawaii Health Connector , which was launched on Oct. 1, took in more than 1,000 applications for health insurance in its first few days of operations despite software problems that did not allow consumers to compare plans."}
