Enlightened men are good, but is that enough?\n\nThe United States doesn\u2019t even appear in the top 20 countries ranked for gender equality in the World Economic Forum\u2019s Global Gender Gap report for 2013.\n\nMost of the inequity has to do with motherhood. Most mothers work for money outside the home, even when they have very young children. But for those without paid parental leave or paid sick days, or the ability to even ask for an alternative schedule without fear of retaliation, their ability to progress economically is severely compromised.\n\nWe can\u2019t wait until the male gatekeepers get comfortable hiring and promoting women in accord with their talents and merits. Practical changes to the infrastructure of the American workplace are called for.\n\nIt\u2019s time to expand the Family and Medical Leave Act to cover more people and provide partial wage replacement. It\u2019s time to pass a federal paid sick days program so workers can get well or care for sick family members without losing their jobs. It\u2019s time for a child care policy that allows all kids access to quality, affordable child care. And it\u2019s time for Congress to pass the Pregnant Workers\u2019 Fairness Act, to outlaw workplace discrimination against pregnant women and ensure reasonable accommodations.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLegislation that acknowledges that working people and family caregivers are one and the same will benefit both the operation of our households and the resiliency of our economy. Women have come as far as they can on their own.\n\nVALERIE A. YOUNG\n\nAdvocacy Coordinator, National Association of Mothers\u2019 Centers\n\nWashington, Nov. 18, 2013\n\nReaders React\n\nMs. Young ends by saying, \u201cWomen have come as far as they can on their own.\u201d That is not true. The glass ceiling that holds women back in the workplace extends into the home, where it is held in place by motherly gatekeeping that in turn holds men back from being seen as fully capable parents. While we would be offended if female workers were routinely portrayed as bumbling in the media, inept male parenting is standard comedic fare. Until men are seen as fully capable parents, women will be perceived as having the primary role in the home.\n\nEven though I am a father of four, I regularly experience overt parental discrimination. A recent example was when I was calling to make flight arrangements for my family. When I requested an \u201cinfant in lap\u201d designation for our toddler, I was told by the airline representative that \u201cbabies generally do better with their mothers.\u201d\n\nUntil women break the glass ceiling that they have created in the home, they will continue to experience a glass ceiling in the workplace.\n\nMARK SHUMATE\n\nRoswell, Ga., Nov. 20, 2013\n\nMs. Young is absolutely correct \u2014 legislative solutions like paid sick days, paid family leave, affordable child care and stronger protections against pregnancy discrimination are critically needed to help mothers, and all caregivers, succeed in the workplace and earn what they deserve.\n\nThe middle- and low-income workers we hear from every day \u2014 who all too often face impossible choices between caring for a new child or sick family member or losing their jobs \u2014 need the law on their side. They often don\u2019t have the benefit of excellent corporate policies and access to flexibility, a privilege disproportionately granted to professional workers.\n\nAnd while supportive spouses, and enlightened male colleagues, are of course a move in the right direction, they\u2019re insufficient to address many mothers\u2019 real needs.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThere are two different conversations going on, and the \u201clean in\u201d discussion, which resonates with a narrow set of workers, is dominating the discussion. It would be wonderful if Sheryl Sandberg\u2019s lean-in circles could encourage enlightened business leaders, both male and female, not only to use their platform to advance women in corporate leadership, but also to help the vast majority of American mothers in today\u2019s work force be able to succeed and adequately care for their families, by supporting better laws and policies for all workers.\n\nDINA BAKST\n\nCo-founder, A Better Balance\n\nNew York, Nov. 21, 2013\n\nExpecting the same compensation without the same sacrifice isn\u2019t an American value. Why is parenthood a special, protected class when it comes to work-life balance?\n\nIf I take a year off to care for aging parents, I don\u2019t expect the same promotional opportunity as a colleague who works 70 hours a week. If I decline to travel for my job so I can attend my kid\u2019s soccer game, I don\u2019t expect the same bonus as a road warrior who spends 80 nights a year in a hotel to call on customers.\n\nFree choice is America\u2019s greatest value \u2014 and we each have the freedom to find our own balance among family, hobbies, continuing education and career.\n\nTop executive roles involve great personal sacrifice. We need to accept that success is not measured only by the salary a person earns or the number of people reporting to him or her. The choice to be an individual contributor or a low-level manager at work so we can spend time with family or play in a band is the greatest expression of individualism and American values.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "opinion", "ptime": 20131123143021, "twitter": {"description": "Readers discuss promoting gender equality at work and home.", "title": "Sunday Dialogue: Helping Women \u2018Lean In\u2019", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/24/opinion/sunday/sunday-dialogue-helping-women-lean-in.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002566917"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/11/24/sunday-review/24letters/24letters-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/24/opinion/sunday/sunday-dialogue-helping-women-lean-in.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002566917", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/24/opinion/sunday/sunday-dialogue-helping-women-lean-in.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion/sunday", "hdl_p": "Sunday Dialogue: Helping Women \u2018Lean In\u2019", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Nov. 23, 2013", "edt": "NewYork", "keywords": "Women and Girls,Discrimination,Work-Life Balance,Parenting,Children and Childhood", "news_keywords": "Discrimination,Parenting", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "SCG": "sunday", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "Readers discuss promoting gender equality at work and home.", "tom": "Letter", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/11/24/sunday-review/24letters/24letters-thumbStandard.jpg", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/11/24/sunday-review/24letters/24letters-thumbLarge.jpg", "description": "Readers discuss promoting gender equality at work and home.", "CG": "opinion", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Nov. 23, 2013", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "Letter", "article": {"section": "Opinion", "modified": "2014-07-17", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Children and Childhood", "published": "2013-11-23", "section-taxonomy-id": "AD8090D7-4137-4D71-84C8-70DA3BD89778"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "slug": "l24dialogue", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20140717145047, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/24/opinion/sunday/sunday-dialogue-helping-women-lean-in.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/11/24/sunday-review/24letters/24letters-videoSixteenByNine1050.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Readers discuss promoting gender equality at work and home.", "title": "Sunday Dialogue: Helping Women \u2018Lean In\u2019"}, "pdate": 20131123, "des": "Children and Childhood", "articleid": 100000002566917, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Sunday Dialogue: Helping Women \u2018Lean In\u2019", "col": "Letters", "PST": "Letter"}, "article_summary": "Most mothers work for money outside the home, even when they have very young children.\nIt\u2019s time to pass a federal paid sick days program so workers can get well or care for sick family members without losing their jobs.\nBut for those without paid parental leave or paid sick days, or the ability to even ask for an alternative schedule without fear of retaliation, their ability to progress economically is severely compromised.\nWe can\u2019t wait until the male gatekeepers get comfortable hiring and promoting women in accord with their talents and merits.\nUntil men are seen as fully capable parents, women will be perceived as having the primary role in the home."}
