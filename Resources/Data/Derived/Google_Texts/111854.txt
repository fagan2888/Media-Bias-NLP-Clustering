The Dodo TheDodo

Investors like cat videos, too.

The Dodo, a wildly popular Internet destination for animal lovers, has been stroked with $11.5 million in funding.

The site for animal videos, photos and stories was founded by Izzie Lerer, who is the editor-at-large of The Dodo. Ms. Lerer is the daughter of Kenneth Lerer, co-founder of the Huffington Post, chairman of BuzzFeed and founder of Lerer Hippeau Ventures, the prolific New York seed-stage investor.

“The site is part advocacy and part entertaining,” said Mr. Lerer of The Dodo.

The Series B investment in The Dodo was led by the Discovery Network Inc. and included three undisclosed venture firms, said Mr. Lerer.

The animal-focused publisher picked up $4.7 million in a Series A round in September 2014. The Dodo was launched in January of last year after $1 million in seed funding from Lerer Hippeau Ventures, Oak Investment Partners and Pilot Group.

New York-based The Dodo has a tab for those viral videos of skateboarding English bulldogs and cat moments that people share on Facebook. The site has more than 1.3 million people who “like” it on Facebook.

The Dodo’s site also has animal stories that cover issues such as the concerns around the treatment of killer whales at SeaWorld.

The Dodo has 15 million monthly active users of its site and serves up more than 100 million video views a month, according to Mr. Lerer.
