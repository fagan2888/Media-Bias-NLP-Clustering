It is time to take our politics back, government back. Citizens, it is time to take our country back,\u201d said Fiorina.\n\nCarly Fiorina tackled issues from ISIS to the Affordable Care Act, including one of her favorite political topics, Hillary Clinton.\n\n\u201cSo the way to beat Hillary Clinton is to point out that she doesn't have a track record of accomplishment, that she's been wrong on every foreign policy challenge, that she lied to the American people,\u201d said Fiorina. \u201cNot just about emails and servers, but about the terrorist attack in Benghazi. And she lied over and over again.\u201d\n\nFiorina not only questioned Hillary Clinton\u2019s credibility, but even weighed in on her husband, saying any former president is fair game.\n\nShe spoke about what she would have done if she were in Hillary Clinton\u2019s shoes when former President Bill Clinton admitted to having sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky.\n\n\u201cIf my husband were doing those things, I would leave him. And yes, I think there is a lot of evidence that Bill Clinton behaved in a predatory manner in some cases,\u201d said Fiorina.\n\nThe former CEO of Hewlett-Packard also criticized Republicans.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump is having a bromance with (Russian President) Vladimir Putin,\u201d said Firoina.\n\nFiorina outlined her \"blueprint\" to the more the 250 people at the town hall meeting.\n\nThe GOP hopeful said she wants to cut jobs at the IRS, repeal and replace Obamacare and defund Planned Parenthood.\n\nFiorina says she opposes abortion because of her husband.\n\n\u201cI learned from his mother that she had been told to abort him. She chose not to. She was a woman of courage and faith. She spent a year in the hospital after his birth. He became the joy of her life, and has been the rock of mine for over 30 years,\u201d said Fiorina.\n\nFiorina also said she wants to create a new app that will allow people to weigh in on public policy.\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"category": "Politics", "ib-analytics": "data", "item-publish-date": "Fri, 08 Jan 2016 01:36:21 EST", "generator": "ibPublish 2", "author": "Stephanie Woods", "og": {"site_name": "WMUR", "description": "Hundreds came to hear Carly Fiorina speak at the Wicwas Lake Grange in Meredith Thursday night.", "title": "Carly Fiorina slams Clintons at Meredith town hall event", "url": "http://www.wmur.com/politics/carly-fiorina-slams-clintons-at-meredith-town-hall-event/37327604", "image": "http://www.wmur.com/image/view/-/37324978/medRes/2/-/maxh/630/maxw/1200/-/5h2jd4/-/img-Carly-Ffiorina-hosts-town-hall-in-Meredith.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.wmur.com/politics/carly-fiorina-slams-clintons-at-meredith-town-hall-event/37327604", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "wmur://content/article/37327604", "iphone": "wmur://content/article/37327604", "googleplay": "wmur://content/article/37327604"}, "name": {"ipad": "wmur", "iphone": "wmur", "googleplay": "wmur"}, "id": {"ipad": 504646663, "iphone": 504646663, "googleplay": "com.hearst.android.wmur"}}, "site": "@wmur9", "card": "app"}, "al": {"android": {"url": "wmur://content/article/37327604", "app_name": "wmur", "package": "com.hearst.android.wmur"}, "ios": {"url": "wmur://content/article/37327604", "app_store_id": 504646663, "app_name": "wmur"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 98665743246}, "vr": {"canonical": "http://www.wmur.com/politics/carly-fiorina-slams-clintons-at-meredith-town-hall-event/37327604"}, "google-site-verification": "xTJFxn8Gm6mXV5ugnbTb198craV_CkoMGMqQyL4EfS4", "keywords": "Carly Fiorina,town hall,meredith,primary,commitment,rgop,republican", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/StephanieWoodsWMUR"}, "news_keywords": "Carly Fiorina,town hall,meredith,primary,commitment,rgop,republican", "description": "Hundreds came to hear Carly Fiorina speak at the Wicwas Lake Grange in Meredith Thursday night."}, "article_summary": "Carly Fiorina tackled issues from ISIS to the Affordable Care Act, including one of her favorite political topics, Hillary Clinton.\nHundreds came to hear Carly Fiorina speak at the Wicwas Lake Grange in Meredith Thursday night.\nFiorina also said she wants to create a new app that will allow people to weigh in on public policy.\nFiorina outlined her \"blueprint\" to the more the 250 people at the town hall meeting.\nHe became the joy of her life, and has been the rock of mine for over 30 years,\u201d said Fiorina."}
