Then our deductible was going to be about $6,000, which is just crazy,\u201d said Susan Shockley.\n\n\n\nInstead, she and her husband pay $300 a month to Liberty Health Share, one of a handful of religious-based Healthcare Sharing Ministries.\n\n\n\nTheir websites all state that it's not insurance, but it's a cost sharing arrangement between members across the country.\n\n\n\nHere's how it works:\n\norganization sets an amount that individuals, couples and families pay each month\n\nthat amount is matched with another member's medical bills for approved expenses\n\nThis month, the Shockleys are helping a couple named Carron and Scott.\n\n\n\n\u201cInstead of my money going to an insurance company and going into a pool or whatever, I actually know where my money is going, which is very nice,\u201d said Shockley.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt's neighbor helping neighbor,\u201d said Dale Bellis, executive director of Liberty Healthshare.\n\n\n\nBellis answered FOX23\u2019s questions from his office in Ohio using Skype.\n\nEXTENDED INTERVIEW: Healthcare sharing\n\n\n\n\u201cAre there any procedures that Liberty Healthshare will not cover?\u201d FOX23\u2019s Shae Rozzi asked.\n\n\n\n\u201cAbortion is one of the expenses that we do not share in. There are some cosmetic surgeries that we don't, the results of drug and alcohol rehabilitation. We do not. So that would be three examples of some of the bills we don't share in,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\n\u201cHow does this medical sharing avoid the federal penalty?\u201d Rozzi asked.\n\nREAD MORE: Healthcare Sharing in Affordable Care Act\n\n\n\n\u201cThankfully embedded in the Affordable Care Act is an exemption for healthcare sharing,\u201d said Bellis.\n\n\n\nBellis said the costs are spread across thousands of families across the United States. He says they've denied some applicants if their medical expenses were too high at the time they tried to sign up.\n\n\n\n\u201cI've been in office for 5 years, and we've had no complaints or consumer issues relative to these since the time I\u2019ve come into office. And I take a lot of complaints on a daily basis and look for these things,\u201d said Oklahoma Insurance Commissioner John Doak.\n\n\n\nDoak did note that healthcare sharing ministries are not regulated, there's no oversight, and since it's not insurance, there's little his office could do to help if there was a problem.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen you're insured, you have recourses to come to the Oklahoma Insurance Department (OID). These types of sharing arrangements, you don't come to the OID. You'd probably go to your Better Business Bureau or through court action,\u201d said Doak.\n\n\n\nThe Shockleys have faith it will work for them.\n\nSEE MORE: Photos from this story\n\n\n\n\u201cI know one day when I need it, the money will be there to take care of me,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\nOne of the ways the ministries keep costs down is that members can't use tobacco or illegal drugs, and they have to live by other Christian standards.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Quick Facts: People who don&rsquo;t like the government requiring they have insurance, don&rsquo;t want to pay expensive premiums and don&rsquo;t want to face a federal penalty are exploring other options FOX23 found out about healthcare sharing ministries some families in Green Country say allows them to have their medical bills covered without having insurance and without facing a fine Families in Green Country are having their healthcare costs taken care of while legally avoiding the federal penalty for not having insurance.", "author": "EndPlay", "og": {"site_name": "KOKI", "description": "Quick Facts: People who don\u2019t like the government requiring they have insurance, don\u2019t want to pay expensive premiums and don\u2019t want to face a federal penalty are exploring other options FOX23 found out about healthcare sharing ministries some families in Green Country say allows them to have their medical bills covered without having insurance and without facing a fine Families in Green Country are having their healthcare costs taken care of while legally avoiding the federal penalty for not having insurance.", "title": "Oklahomans use Healthcare Sharing Ministries", "url": "http://www.fox23.com/news/local/oklahomans-use-healthcare-sharing-ministries_nk5pb/67078402", "image": {"height": 90, "width": 160, "altText": "Healthcare sharing community _7188442", "identifier": "http://mediaweb.fox23.com/photo/2015/04/29/use_2_1367277_ver1.0_160_90.JPG", "title": "Healthcare sharing community _7188442"}, "locale": "en_US", "video": {"width": 0, "thumbnailUrl": "http://mediaweb.fox23.com/photo/2016/02/04/Oklahomans%20use%20Healthcare%20Sharing%20Ministries_11116059_1454583281843_1255189_ver1.0_1280_720.jpg", "content-type": "video", "title": "Oklahomans use Healthcare Sharing Ministries", "height": 0}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Quick Facts: People who don\u2019t like the government requiring they have insurance, don\u2019t want to pay expensive premiums and don\u2019t want to face a federal penalty are exploring other options FOX23 found out about healthcare sharing ministries some families in Green Country say allows them to have their medical bills covered without having insurance and without facing a fine Families in Green Country are having their healthcare costs taken care of while legally avoiding the federal penalty for not having insurance.", "title": "Oklahomans use Healthcare Sharing Ministries", "url": "http://www.fox23.com/news/local/oklahomans-use-healthcare-sharing-ministries_nk5pb/67078402", "image": {"width": 1280, "identifier": "http://mediaweb.fox23.com/photo/2015/04/29/use_2_1367277_ver1.0_1280_720.JPG", "height": 720}, "site": "@FOX23", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "top story,Headlines,FOX23 Investigates, StoryKeywords", "article": {"section": "Local", "tag": "headlines, top story, fox23 investigates", "published_time": "2015-04-29T22:45:00+0000", "modified_time": "2015-04-30T00:17:09+0000"}, "page-type": "article", "content_id": 67078402, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Oklahomans use Healthcare Sharing Ministries"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0340\"", "article_summary": "READ MORE: Healthcare Sharing in Affordable Care Act\u201cThankfully embedded in the Affordable Care Act is an exemption for healthcare sharing,\u201d said Bellis.\nThey\u2019re part of healthcare sharing ministries that help people pay medical bills without paying insurance costs.\nInstead, she and her husband pay $300 a month to Liberty Health Share, one of a handful of religious-based Healthcare Sharing Ministries.\nREAD MORE: Popular Healthcare Sharing MinistriesOne family told FOX23 that being self-employed made traditional health insurance costs too expensive.\nDoak did note that healthcare sharing ministries are not regulated, there's no oversight, and since it's not insurance, there's little his office could do to help if there was a problem."}
