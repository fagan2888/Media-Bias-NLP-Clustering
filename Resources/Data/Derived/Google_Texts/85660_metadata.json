He\u2019s about to open a luxury hospital for pet animals in Las Vegas. Ensign, who\u2019s trained as a veterinarian, describes his business model as a blend of \u201ccutting-edge care with Ritz-Carlton services.\u201d\n\nA profile in the Las Vegas Review-Journal reports that the former lawmaker\u2019s new pet hospital includes a 1,600-square-foot exercise area, pet boarding suites with flat-screen televisions showing the DOGTV channel, webcams so owners can monitor their dogs online, high-density insulation to help keep down on noise and \u201creduce pet stress,\u201d and on-site ultrasound and digital X-ray machines. Ensign explained even in the struggling economy, spending on pets has increased.\n\nWhen asked about his feelings about leaving Washington, DC behind, Ensign told reporters that he did not miss the nation\u2019s capital. The Review-Journal\u2019s piece notes that \u201cthe only time he brought up politics unprompted was when a reporter asked how big he wanted his nine-employee clinic to get. He smiled and said he didn\u2019t want more than 50 employees \u2014 a dig at the health coverage mandate on businesses that pass that threshold under Obamacare, the insurance-reform law Ensign voted against.\u201d\n\nEnsign is opening his own business despite his frequent insinuations that the health law will make it too hard for small business owners to get off the ground. \u201cThis is one of the most fiscally damaging laws in the history of our nation, and we simply cannot afford it,\u201d Ensign said in 2011 after casting one of his many votes to defund Obamacare. \u201cThe billions of dollars that it will cost our state and the constraints it will place on small businesses across our country is unsustainable. I have met with many small businesses throughout Nevada that have had to scale back operations and cut employees because of the onerous costs that they will likely incur in the name of healthcare reform.\u201d\n\nObamacare\u2019s employer mandate intends to ensure that businesses cannot skip out on providing adequate health coverage to employees who are working at least 30 hours a week. Opponents of the health reform law, like Ensign, claim this particular provision is too expensive for companies to follow. They say it\u2019s forcing employers to slash workers\u2019 schedules so they remain below 30 hours, or cut back on hiring new employees, in order to avoid the requirement to extend basic health benefits. In reality, however, outside studies have found that very few companies are cutting hours or avoiding hiring specifically because of Obamacare. Instead, employers are using the health law as a convenient excuse to skimp out on benefits \u2014 something they were doing long before Obamacare was around.\n\nEnsign perhaps wasn\u2019t pleased about the contrast between the luxury care he provides to pets and the basic health care he is skeptical about providing to employees. In the updated version of the article that is currently available online, his comment about Obamacare is removed.
