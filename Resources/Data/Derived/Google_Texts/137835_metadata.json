Richard Nixon famously went on Laugh In during the 1968 campaign. Bill Clinton blew his sax on The Arsenio Hall Show in 1992. Appearances on Saturday Night Live have become a de facto requirement for presidential candidates. But there may be no more unlikely choice for a TV appearance by a potential leader of the free world than Hillary Clinton\u2019s appearance tonight on Broad City.\n\nThe logic behind Clinton\u2019s guest spot on the show is clear \u2014 but it also could offer her opponents plenty of cudgels they could use against her in what is already shaping up to be a nasty election.\n\nRelated:Hillary Clinton Breaks the Back of the Sanders Revolution\n\nBroad City, for those unaware, is hot, hip, social media friendly and may very well be the funniest thing currently on Comedy Central. It is the brainchild of two talented young women, Ilana Glazer and Abbi Jacobson (with a sizeable assist from producer Amy Poehler). It is created by and routinely features the exact sort of creative New York personalities that led Hillary to put her campaign mothership in Brooklyn. And it wears its feminist flag proudly.\n\nThe show is essentially a take on the Laverne and Shirley formula (this is an oversimplification that drastically undersells the charms and creativity of the show, but you get the point) with two Jewish girls in modern New York City blundering their way through life. Without the pretensions of HBO\u2019s Girls, Broad City dares you not to love Abbi and Illana while openly acknowledging that they are obliviously leaving a wake of destruction in their path. If Clinton wants to recapture the cool vibe she enjoyed at the height of the \u201cTexts from Hillary\u201d memes in 2012, Broad City is a no-brainer.\n\nBut\u2026there\u2019s also a definite downside for a candidate who is now looking ahead to the general election. No show on television celebrates marijuana more openly, for example. In keeping with its modern New York setting, the show also features a wide variety of ethnicities and sexual orientations. In fact, Illana\u2019s omni-sexuality is one of the bigger sources of laughs.\n\nFor a lot of Hillary supporters, and a lot of the population of New York, this is a wonderful depiction \u2014 or again, celebration \u2014 of the life they live. It is refreshing to see a version of Brooklyn that\u2019s recognizable to its inhabitants, as opposed to the standard sitcom version that is often foisted on audiences.\n\nStill, no matter how brief or tame her role is \u2014 and it\u2019s highly unlikely she\u2019ll get the kind of treatment the show gave Kelly Ripa, who played a gloriously drunk and sexually voracious version of herself \u2014 it is easy to see Clinton being criticized in some corners for appearing on a show that celebrates \u201cdeviance\u201d and drug use.\n\nRelated: Why \u2018The Daily Show\u2019 Can\u2019t Lose with Trevor Noah\n\nAdditionally, and unexpectedly, there is also a potential risk from the left. Months ago, when Hillary filmed her appearance, Bernie Sanders\u2019 populist surge hadn\u2019t yet emerged as a substantial threat to her sure-thing candidacy. Given that much of Broad City\u2019s fan base overlaps with that of Sanders, Clinton\u2019s stances on marijuana legalization and various LGBT rights issues could leave her vulnerable to attacks from impassioned supporters of Sanders (and the show).\n\nThe show\u2019s two stars have even done some low-key PR to manage any blowback, explicitly stating that Clinton\u2019s appearance is not an endorsement of her presidential campaign, but simply a celebration of her as a role model for women.\n\nIn all likelihood, tonight\u2019s appearance will come and go as no more than another blip in the raging culture war, but it may not be the Millennial-luring slam dunk it must have seemed to be several months ago.\n\nHopefully it\u2019ll make good TV.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "There is a long history of politicians using popular television comedy shows to boost", "title": "Why Exactly Is Hillary Clinton Going on \u2018Broad City\u2019 Tonight?", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/03/16/Why-Exactly-Hillary-Clinton-Going-Broad-City-Tonight", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/landscape-1458066616-elle-hillary-index.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/03/16/Why-Exactly-Hillary-Clinton-Going-Broad-City-Tonight", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/landscape-1458066616-elle-hillary-index.jpg", "creator": "@DrMonkeyPHD", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "There is a long history of politicians using popular television comedy shows to boost", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "But there may be no more unlikely choice for a TV appearance by a potential leader of the free world than Hillary Clinton\u2019s appearance tonight on Broad City.\nIf Clinton wants to recapture the cool vibe she enjoyed at the height of the \u201cTexts from Hillary\u201d memes in 2012, Broad City is a no-brainer.\nWithout the pretensions of HBO\u2019s Girls, Broad City dares you not to love Abbi and Illana while openly acknowledging that they are obliviously leaving a wake of destruction in their path.\nMonths ago, when Hillary filmed her appearance, Bernie Sanders\u2019 populist surge hadn\u2019t yet emerged as a substantial threat to her sure-thing candidacy.\nRelated:Hillary Clinton Breaks the Back of the Sanders RevolutionBroad City, for those unaware, is hot, hip, social media friendly and may very well be the funniest thing currently on Comedy Central."}
