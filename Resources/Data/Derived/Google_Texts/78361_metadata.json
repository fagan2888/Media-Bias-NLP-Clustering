The legislation requires an abortion provider to meet with a woman seeking an abortion for a consultation appointment at least 24 hours prior to her procedure.\n\nLynda Bell, the president of Florida Right to Life, told The Daily Signal that \u201ca 24-hour waiting period makes sense.\u201d\n\nShe said that a waiting period \u201cnot only protects women and young girls from making a rash decision at a very difficult time, it could protect them from being pressured into abortion from much older boyfriends, or others who are trying to coerce a young woman into a procedure that may affect them for the rest of their lives.\u201d\n\nShe said the \u201creflection period\u201d doesn\u2019t \u201chinder access.\u201d\n\n\u201cTwenty-five other states have similar waiting periods. A few have 48 and more hours before acquiring an abortion,\u201d Bell said.\n\nAfter the law\u2019s passage, the ACLU of Florida and the Center for Reproductive Rights filed a lawsuit claiming that the law was in violation of the right to privacy guaranteed in Florida\u2019s Constitution.\n\nOn Tuesday, Leon County Chief Circuit Judge Charles Francis issued a temporary injunction one day before the law was scheduled to go into effect.\n\nFlorida Attorney General Pam Bondi\u2019s office appealed Francis\u2019 injunction in the First District Court of Appeals, prompting a stay on the ruling, and allowing the law to go into effect.\n\nThe Associated Press reports that the case has since been \u201ctransferred to a new judge on Wednesday as part of an annual rotation of judges.\u201d\n\nIn a joint statement, the ACLU of Florida and the Center for Reproductive Rights praised the judge\u2019s injunction order.\n\nNancy Abudu, legal director the ACLU of Florida said that \u201cwe are very pleased that the court saw this law for what it is: An unconstitutional attack on the right of Florida women to make their own choices about their health care, including abortion.\u201d\n\nAutumn Katz, a staff attorney for the Center for Reproductive Rights, said that \u201cwe will continue to fight this demeaning law until the courts permanently strike it down.\u201d\n\nAfter Bondi\u2019s appeal, both groups vowed to keep fighting the law.\n\nFlorida Right to Life\u2019s Bell said that it\u2019s \u201cironic\u201d that opponents of the measure often support similar waiting periods for other services.\n\n\u201cThe irony from the pro-abortion industry and the ACLU is they do not object to waiting periods to purchase a gun, marry or divorce,\u201d Bell said. \u201cIn fact, D.C. is considering a new rule to require a 24-hour waiting period before getting a tattoo. They surmise that too many get them on a whim and later regret them!\u201d\n\nAn abortion is a medical procedure, Bell said, and many medical procedures require a consultation appointment prior to the day of surgery.\n\n\u201cBefore performing almost any surgical procedure, doctors sit with the patient, explain the procedure, tell the patient to schedule an appointment with their primary physician, where they have a check up, blood work, sometimes chest x-rays and EEG\u2019s,\u201d Bell said. \u201cThey then schedule the surgery for a later date.\u201d\n\nBell promised her organization will \u201ccontinue to fight\u201d for \u201cwomen, young women and girls.\u201d\n\nIn April, the law was passed by the Florida Senate in a 26-13 vote and by the Florida House in a 77-41 vote. Gov. Rick Scott, a Republican, signed it into law in June.", "article_metadata": {"description": "There are legal challenges ahead.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "There are legal challenges ahead.", "title": "Law Instituting 24 Hour Waiting Period for Abortion Goes Into Effect", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150701_FloridaAbortion_Scanlon.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-07-02T15:40:48+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1NzIN7Z"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "There are legal challenges ahead.", "title": "Law Instituting 24 Hour Waiting Period for Abortion Goes Into Effect", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150701_FloridaAbortion_Scanlon.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "Protecting Life", "published_time": "2015-07-02T14:51:06+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-02T15:40:48+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Abortion, Florida, Right to Life, pro-life, abortion waiting period"}, "article_summary": "After being temporarily delayed by a judge, a Florida law that institutes a mandatory 24-hour waiting period before undergoing an abortion went into effect on Wednesday.\n\u201cIn fact, D.C. is considering a new rule to require a 24-hour waiting period before getting a tattoo.\nA few have 48 and more hours before acquiring an abortion,\u201d Bell said.\nFlorida Right to Life\u2019s Bell said that it\u2019s \u201cironic\u201d that opponents of the measure often support similar waiting periods for other services.\nThe legislation requires an abortion provider to meet with a woman seeking an abortion for a consultation appointment at least 24 hours prior to her procedure."}
