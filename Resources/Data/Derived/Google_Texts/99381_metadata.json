He said the law probably has more support than many Republicans are willing to acknowledge.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s repealable,\u201d Gingrich said. His comments were published by USA Today Thursday after he spoke at a Washington health-care conference on Wednesday.\n\nGingrich, however, was critical of the Affordable Care Act. He said that although he once supported a mandate requiring all individuals to buy insurance, he now is opposed to it, saying it\u2019s too \u201cauthoritarian.\u201d\n\nHe adds that the number of people added to insurance rolls through Obamacare exchanges is relatively small, compared with the rest of the population, and that a large portion of those now covered under the law came via Medicaid expansions.\n\n\u201cThat was always an easy, short-term fix,\u201d he told USA Today\u2019s Jayne O\u2019Donnell in an interview held before those attending the conference. He said the cost to pay for getting many Obamacare recipients is high.\n\nHe also scoffed at law\u2019s provision that allows young adults to remain on their parents\u2019 insurance policies until the age of 26.\n\n\u201cI know the age of maturity has gone up,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it strikes me that you have your kids hanging around the house until they\u2019re 26, living on your insurance, there\u2019s something wrong with the American economy if we have drifted into that particular model.\u201d\n\nGingrich says how the Affordable Care Act fares going forward will depend on who wins the 2016 presidential election and how they will modify the divisive measure.\n\nMore from MarketWatch", "article_metadata": {"lifp_basePath": "https://id.marketwatch.com/access", "twitter": {"domain": "marketwatch.com", "description": "Former Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich says the GOP doesn\u2019t really want to repeal Obamacare because there are parts of the law that have proven to be popular.", "creator": "@russbrittmktw", "image": {"width": 569, "identifier": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-BU802_gingri_MG_20140218110635.jpg", "height": 398}, "site": {"id": 624413}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "parsely-author": "Russ Britt", "article.content_group": "marketwatch", "article.section": "Industries", "parsely-type": "post", "description": "Former Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich says the GOP doesn\u2019t really want to repeal Obamacare because there are parts of the law that have proven to be popular.", "parsely-link": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/gingrich-says-gop-doesnt-really-want-to-repeal-obamacare-2015-03-26", "author": "Russ Britt", "parsely-title": "Gingrich says GOP doesn\u2019t really want to repeal Obamacare", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=336693422", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-03-26T17:05:00-04:00", "page.site": "marketwatch", "robots": "noarchive,noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 283204329838}, "parsely-section": "MW_Industries", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "og": {"site_name": "MarketWatch", "description": "Former Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich says the GOP doesn\u2019t really want to repeal Obamacare because there are parts of the law that have proven to be popular.", "title": "Gingrich says GOP doesn\u2019t really want to repeal Obamacare", "url": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/gingrich-says-gop-doesnt-really-want-to-repeal-obamacare-2015-03-26", "image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-BU802_gingri_MG_20140218110635.jpg", "type": "article"}, "ob": {"image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-BU802_gingri_MG_20140218110635.jpg"}, "article.id": "263B7FC8-D3E7-11E4-BDE2-3E92EAF1FFF6", "position": 1}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdffca\"", "article_summary": "LOS ANGELES (MarketWatch) -- Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich says he doesn\u2019t think Obamacare is \u201crepealable,\u201d and contends that many of his fellow Republicans don\u2019t really want to walk back the entire law.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s repealable,\u201d Gingrich said.\nHe said the law probably has more support than many Republicans are willing to acknowledge.\nHe said the cost to pay for getting many Obamacare recipients is high.\nHis comments were published by USA Today Thursday after he spoke at a Washington health-care conference on Wednesday."}
