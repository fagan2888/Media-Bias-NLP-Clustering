(Photo: John Samora, John Samora/ The Republic) Story Highlights Biggs is blocking a program that would allow tens of thousands of kids to go to the doctor at no cost to the state\n\nHis reasons a are illogical\n\nGov. Ducey needs to assure this program is part of the budget\n\nWhat Senate President Andy Biggs is doing with KidsCare is just plain wrong, and his explanation for doing it is hopelessly illogical.\n\nHe\u2019s blocking restoration of a program that would allow tens of thousands of kids to go to the doctor at no cost to the state.\n\nThese are the children of the working poor. Their parents make too much to qualify for Medicaid and too little to buy into Obamacare.\n\nIf Biggs won't budge, it will be up to Gov. Doug Ducey to restore this pro-family program.\n\nAHCCCS, which is Arizona\u2019s Medicaid program, projects that 30,000 kids could benefit from KidsCare.\n\nWhich is it: No need or too much?\n\nFrom one side of his mouth, Biggs says that estimate is a figment of reporters\u2019 imaginations. He questions the need.\n\nFrom the other side of his mouth, he says Arizona shouldn\u2019t restore the program because, as he recently told Ted Simons on KAET-TV's \"Arizona Horizon,\" doing so \u201cwould create a constituency of up to 50,000 people\u201d who would object if the program were ever cut.\n\nHow to contact Andy Biggs Pressure Senate President Andy Biggs to allow a vote on KidsCare. You can: Send him an email: Fill out this online form. Call his office: (602) 926-4371.\n\nSo which is it, Sen. Biggs? There\u2019s no need? Or is there such a great need that satisfying it would create a massive constituency of formerly sick kids? A constituency so strong the state would be forced to pay for the program if the feds decided to stop funding it 100 percent?\n\nYes. 100 percent. It\u2019s important to remember that restoring KidsCare would be paid for entirely by the federal government at least through 2017, and possibly through 2019. That's years of doctors visits. Years of care that could make a life-changing difference to tens of thousands of Arizona families.\n\nDon't trust the triggers? Let's look at history\n\nThe bill \u2013 HB 2309 -- that Biggs refuses to hear in the Senate includes an escape clause that says the program ends if the feds fall short of fully funding that promise.\n\nBiggs says he doesn\u2019t trust such \"triggers\" built into the bill.\n\nBut those who say lawmakers would be prevented from lowering the ax on KidsCare ignore history.\n\nBefore the recession, Arizona participated in KidsCare, which then required a state match. For every $1 from Arizona, the feds put in $3. It was a good deal.\n\nFreezing the program during the recession made no economic sense. But lawmakers did it anyway.\n\nArizona saved $12.9 million in fiscal 2011 by eviscerating KidsCare, but our state lost $41 million in federal matching money that year, according to the Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured.\n\nWe all pay for 'uncompensated' care\n\nThat was at a time when people were losing their jobs and houses. Then \u2013 as now \u2013 parents without health care for their kids wind up in hospital emergency rooms when simple conditions that went untreated turned complex.\n\nEmergency rooms are the most costly option. We all end up paying for \u201cuncompensated\u201d care.\n\nThere\u2019s more to Biggs\u2019 illogical defense of blocking a vote: He's taking one for the team. \u201cI take the beating,\u201d he told Simons. He provides cover for KidsCare opponents who are not as willing as he is to publicly stand between kids and doctors.\n\nC'mon. Really?\n\nBiggs is no martyr\n\nTaking a \u201cbeating\u201d to spare GOP lawmakers the pain of voting on a bill that lets kids go to the doctor may seem like a profile in courage to the president of the Arizona Senate. It\u2019s not.\n\nIn the House, which is not known as a gathering place of squishy liberals, HB 2309 passed 47-12. The bill has a Republican sponsor, Rep. Regina Cobb.\n\nHouse Speaker David Gowan, who felt the need to assure a safe distance from the terrifying queries and deafening keystrokes of reporters, nevertheless let his members dare to take responsibility for their votes on KidsCare. Are senators more fragile?\n\nBiggs says: \u201cI don\u2019t support KidsCare.\u201d But it\u2019s no reason to prevent others from voting.\n\nArizona taxpayers and parents whose children\u2019s health hangs in the balance have one more hope: Gov. Ducey, whose devotion to family values is oft-repeated, can assure KidsCare is included in the budget.\n\nDucey should recognize how illogical it is to let other states lay claim to federal money that could cool the fevered brow of Arizona kids.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://azc.cc/1N57RrF", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Our View: You know what makes sense?
