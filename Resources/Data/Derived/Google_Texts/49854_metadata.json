ROB VARELA/THE STAR Southland Sod Farms President Jurgen Gramckow picks up a piece of Marathon sod.\n\nBy Tom Kisken of the Ventura County Star\n\nIf Jurgen Gramckow has been vilified as he claims, his black hat is revealed in the vanity plate on his Chevy SUV.\n\n\u201cBest Sod,\u201d it says.\n\nGramckow grows sod in lush, irrigated rows that once consumed 2,000 acres, much of it south of Oxnard. He sells it across Southern California, though less than he once did with that high-water production mark now reduced to 500 acres.\n\nThe 39-year-old Southland Sod Farms he started with his father ranks among the biggest in the state and along with nearby Pacific Sod dominated Ventura County\u2019s turfgrass market for decades.\n\nHe contends a bull\u2019s-eye has been painted on the industry\u2019s backside because of the drought, more so because of the rebates and campaigns encouraging homeowners to pull out squares of perfect green.\n\n\u201cThis is truly a case of throwing the baby out with the bath water,\u201d said Gramckow, contending replace-your-lawn efforts cost far too much and end up saving little water. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re being unfairly scapegoated. It\u2019s simply not even going to make a dent.\u201d\n\nGreen giants\n\nIn 1960, a California tomato and sugar beet farmer named Toby Grether reflected on a sod industry developing in the Midwest and East.\n\n\u201cHe said, \u2018You know what? That might work here,\u2019\u201d said Gramckow, whose father, Werner, worked as a bookkeeper for Grether.\n\nGrether\u2019s Cal Turf was the first sod producer in the state, marking Ventura County as a grassy birthplace. The industry boomed with two of its SoCal giants, Pacific Sod and Southland Sod, headquartered within miles of each other on Hueneme Road.\n\nA heady heyday included the greening of residential neighborhoods across Southern California. More than 100 million square feet of Marathon Sod, produced by Gramckow\u2019s company, was sold per year.\n\nBoth farms have cut back. Pacific Sod leases out land to other farmers. Southland Sod has diversified, using computers and scales to measure how much water is needed by raspberries potted in ground-up coconut fibers.\n\nGramckow said the biggest trigger for the reduction was a residential construction market that went south in 2008. The drought has pushed the company to pull back more.\n\nEarl Slack, senior vice president of farming operations for Pacific Sod, offered little comment, except to say it\u2019s too soon to measure the impact of the drought.\n\nOutsiders say orders for sod have plummeted.\n\n\u201cI just had one this week,\u201d said Ken Kramer, owner of Pacific Coast Landscape in Oxnard. \u201cIt\u2019s the first one in probably three months.\u201d\n\nChanging culture\n\nWhen Gov. Jerry Brown announced mandatory 25 percent water reductions on April 1, he said the state would partner with local governments in removing lawns. The target is 50 million square feet.\n\nUntil recently, residents in much of Ventura County could walk away with $3 for every square foot of lawn removed via rebates offered by the Metropolitan Water District and one of its member agencies, Calleguas Municipal Water District. Now the rebate is $2.\n\nThe city of Ventura plans to roll out rebates of a similar amount sometime this summer.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re changing the market and culture,\u201d said Eric Bergh, manager of resources for Calleguas. He said the goal isn\u2019t to remove grass everywhere but to replace it in places where its only role is eye candy.\n\n\u201cThis is all about water supply,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re recovering some of that water that is just being used in ... nonfunctional turf.\u201d\n\nBut the rebates make some growers of green see red.\n\nDan Gibson owns Valley Sod Farms, which produces sod in locations including land outside the Ventura County border east of Piru. He said he can accept a decline in demand that happens without interference.\n\n\u201cI object to the government injecting itself into the market and affecting our livelihood by doing so,\u201d he said.\n\nIt\u2019s a battle in which both sides turn to calculators.\n\nConverting landscape can help an average Ventura homeowner reduce a household\u2019s water usage by 35 percent, said Joe McDermott, assistant general manager for Ventura Water.\n\nGramckow offered up formulas that suggest eliminating all landscaping in all California\u2019s cities would save only 9 percent of its total water.\n\nPaying publicly funded rebates reaching $3.75 per square foot in some areas means removing lawns is far more expensive than creating desalination programs or recycling municipal water, Gramckow said.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a tremendous waste of money,\u201d he said.\n\nSetting priorities\n\nTony Emmert, deputy general manager of the United Water Conservation District, sees both sides. He said sod growers attract more criticism than they deserve.\n\nHe also said the highest priority for water is basic human need. Second is production of food and what he called essential industries.\n\n\u201cProbably lowest on the scale is the aesthetic use of water,\u201d Emmert said. \u201cIf you have to cut back somewhere, that\u2019s where you cut back first.\u201d\n\nSod supporters say grass serves as a natural coolant. Take it away and there are consequences, said Jim Baird, turfgrass specialist at UC Riverside.\n\n\u201cOur cities are going to heat up and we have to cool them,\u201d Baird said, citing the elements used to create energy. \u201cWhat does it take to cool them? It takes water.\u201d\n\nBaird and other academicians offer other solutions. Teach people they can cut way back on how much they water sod. Push grasses like Bermuda, zoysia and buffalograss that use far less water but tend to brown in the winter.\n\nGramckow grows zoysia and Bermuda but in small quantities.\n\n\u201cPeople haven\u2019t wanted to buy them,\u201d he said. \u201cWe grow what people buy. The reason they don\u2019t buy them is they don\u2019t stay green year-round.\u201d\n\nHe thinks the future of sod in Southern California may not be as green as its past. But he predicts people will come back to turfgrass in time; the industry will survive.\n\n\u201cTurf\u2019s never going away because that\u2019s where kids and dogs go play,\u201d he said.\n\nBaird of UC Riverside is hopeful too. As he offered his optimism, he cited the weather forecast.\n\n\u201cI hope it rains,\u201d he said. \u201c ...
