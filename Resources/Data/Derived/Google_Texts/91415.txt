It was a jumpinâ€™ good time at the Frank Cochran center Saturday!

The Carter Foundation, along with Bridge Builders of Meridian, put on its first youth Christmas festival and can food drive. The first 100 kids to arrive received a toy which all were given out within 10 minutes. Children had fun playing basketball, musical chairs, bouncing in bounce houses and talking to Santa Claus.

The head of the Carter Foundation, James Carter, says goodies collected at the drive will go to feed the homeless, and the main focus of the festival was to help the youth of Meridian know they have a voice.

"We want the kids going into the holidays that will be off school for two weeks. So we want to remove all of the negative thoughts out of their head and remain optimistic," James Carter says.

The Carter Foundation and Bridge Builders of Meridian have monthly events for youth in Meridian and plan to have this festival every year.
