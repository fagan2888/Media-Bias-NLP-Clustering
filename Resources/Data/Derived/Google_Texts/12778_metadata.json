In a letter two days before Thanksgiving 2015, 22 of those employees learned that they no longer qualified for health care under the ACA and that their current benefits would end at the close of the year.\n\nA third-party company called Worxtime, an ACA compliance web application, calculated their hours and found that they were not eligible to receive benefits mandated by the ACA guidelines. Although some of the classified employees had worked at least six hours per day, school breaks impacted their totals.\n\n\u201cThe 22 employees qualified the year before because when we ran the calculations, we thought that those weeks off shouldn\u2019t be counted. As it turns out, they do count,\u201d Superintendent Terry Decker explained in an interview at the time, adding that the district also calculated the hours. \u201cThe Affordable Care Act is built for the corporate world \u2014 52 weeks a year. We have two weeks of winter break. We have a week at Thanksgiving. That time period keeps clocking.\u201d\n\nSeveral classified employees shared their concerns before the board during the regularly scheduled December meeting, with certificated staff members showing support. Because the issue was not among the board\u2019s agenda items, however, board members could not speak on the subject, according to the Brown Act.\n\nWithin days, the district called a special meeting to address the matter, and on Dec. 18, the school board voted unanimously to revise its policies and offer medical insurance for classified employees who regularly work at least six hours per day and 30 hours per week.\n\n\u201cI believe that every difficult situation has a silver lining,\u201d board president Vicki King said at the time. \u201cOne of the silver linings in this, among many, is that we, as a board, got to see and believe and feel the passion that you all have for your jobs.\n\n\u201c\u2026It really showed me the passion and how fortunate we are as a district to have not just the teaching staff, but the classified staff that do some of the hardest work for our students and our children.\u201d\n\nAlthough benefits were reinstated through board policy revisions, the issue had already sparked other concerns among some classified staff. They shared their worries with certificated staff, who put them in touch with a representative from the California Teachers Association, which represents the certificated staff. The 325,000-member California Teachers Association is affiliated with the 3 million-member National Education Association.\n\nPark pointed out that because it is a policy change, the policy could be changed again in the future. For this, and other reasons, classified staff obtained the number of signatures necessary to petition the state\u2019s Public Employment Relations Board to form a union.\n\nAlthough they gathered enough signatures, the Solana Beach School District objected the group\u2019s petition to form a union three times, Park said.\n\nFirst, the district asked for a recount. Then the district objected to the \u201cappropriateness\u201d of the union.\n\n\u201cBecause they objected to the appropriateness of the union, it kind of gave us an edge,\u201d Park said. \u201cAfter they objected to the appropriateness of the union, we got more signatures showing more interest. Therefore, it sped the process along because we didn\u2019t need to have an anonymous mail-out ballot vote.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat signature gathering has to be 50 percent plus one, or the majority of the people,\u201d added Cynthia Manjarrez, a consultant with the California Teachers Association. \u201cWe gathered probably 68 percent. It was substantial.\u201d\n\nFinally, the district requested that supervisory positions not be eligible for membership, of which the group eventually agreed.\n\n\u201cIt was inevitable that we were going to be a union because we had all the qualifications, but our district used stall tactics,\u201d Park said.\n\nA total of 219 classified employees are eligible for membership, Manjarrez said, noting that the group is one of the largest chapters for education support professionals in the north coastal area.\n\n\u201cThey felt they had no voice,\u201d Manjarrez said. \u201cI think that for any union, the strongest and the biggest benefit is the benefit of speaking collectively.\n\n\u201cOne of the reasons the ESP (Education Support Professionals) chose to join forces with CTA is because they were impressed with the services that the teachers received from the California Teachers Association,\u201d she added. \u201cMany of them are very proud of the work they do in serving the students of Solana Beach. They very much consider themselves professionals, and they very much wanted to join the ranks of the teachers.\u201d\n\nManjarrez does not know the exact number of positons that are not eligible for membership. She said she has requested public information from the district five times since the group initiated the process in the fall, but the district has failed to provide such information.\n\n\u201cThey have ignored our request for public information,\u201d said Manjarrez, who is submitting another request for the number of positions and names of the people not being represented.\n\n\u201cSome of those supervisors have contacted us and requested to be part of the union,\u201d she added. \u201cThat brings up a whole issue, in terms of what their rights are. Without that information of who they are and what position they hold, we can\u2019t move forward.\u201d\n\nNow that the union is official, initial meetings are being planned for every school site before or after school hours April 11-15, so site representatives can be selected.\n\n\u201cA union is stronger with numbers,\u201d Park said. \u201cAt this point, we feel very confident that everybody will become a member. We\u2019re shooting for 100 percent.\u201d\n\nA districtwide meeting for the organization is slated for 7 p.m. April 20 at Skyline, when an election will be held for the group\u2019s president, vice president, secretary and treasurer. A committee will then be established to write the group\u2019s bylaws.\n\n\u201cRepresentatives will collaborate with their peers on issues, concerns, things that they think would be beneficial, things that are working \u2014 the whole shebang,\u201d Park said. \u201cOnce we collaborate then we\u2019re going to start negotiating with the district, working together in alliance with the district in good faith and good intentions for the greater purpose of education in our district, not for a good business model and how to save money.\u201d\n\nAmong other concerns, classified staff hope to have prep time, professional development, stipends and other benefits like certificated staff, Park said.\n\n\u201cThose are things that people like us would love to have,\u201d he said.\n\nSuperintendent Terry Decker said he is looking forward to working with the group.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking forward to working with the leadership of the new organization,\u201d Decker said in an email. \u201cWe have outstanding classified staff members in our district, and they are integral to the success of our students.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Solana Beach, school district, classified employees, union, labor union, Solana Beach School District", "og": {"site_name": "Del Mar Times", "description": "After months of grassroots efforts, classified employees of the Solana Beach School District have officially established a labor union.", "title": "Solana Beach School District\u2019s classified employees form union", "url": "http://www.delmartimes.net/news/2016/apr/05/solana-beach-school-district-union/", "image": "http://media.delmartimes.net/img/photos/2015/01/26/IMG_0189_tx201.JPG?a7afd4f196cc87f88131a6d97e3ddf50b1644c7d", "type": "article"}, "\u201drobots\u201d": "\u201dnoodp\u201d", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=478488999", "fb": {"admins": 100002822783687, "app_id": 227086564005280}, "msvalidate.01": "2AF9F2CAA01E4774AB920A8D645E9566", "verify-v1": "6ylWgY9aqB0mJpcLJKDC73u2SDU/3xlc3MH+PxXmLRY=", "y_key": "f9413f5ffc5479bd", "viewport": "width=device-width", "description": "After months of grassroots efforts, classified employees of the Solana Beach School District have officially established a labor union."}, "article_summary": "After months of grassroots efforts, classified employees of the Solana Beach School District have officially established a labor union.\nAlthough they gathered enough signatures, the Solana Beach School District objected the group\u2019s petition to form a union three times, Park said.\nAlthough some of the classified employees had worked at least six hours per day, school breaks impacted their totals.\nA total of 46 classified employees were eligible for benefits when the Affordable Care Act went into effect in 2014.\n\u201cWe have outstanding classified staff members in our district, and they are integral to the success of our students.\u201d"}
