In a letter sent to Chairmen Brady, Tiberi, and Roskam as well as Ranking Members Levin, McDermott, and Lewis, the AHA Executive Vice President Thomas Nickels argues that US laws should assist with aligning payers and providers on value-based care reimbursement goals instead of hindering the efforts.\n\nIn particular, AHA seeks to provide more input on the physician self-referral law or Stark law. This particular legislation allows doctors to refer their patients to a hospital, clinic, or other medical facility in which the physician has financial stock in. The letter from AHA mentions that the Stark law may actually impede the implementation of new payment models that focus on value-based care reimbursement.\n\nOne barrier to new payment structures that Congress has eliminated in the past was the \u201cgainsharing\u201d Civil Monetary Penalty (CMP), the AHA letter mentions. This particular penalty stopped hospitals from incentivizing doctors from a monetary perspective when they had created and adopted evidence-based care frameworks.\n\nThe letter details how the Stark law can be changed to better adopt the provisions of the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act (MACRA) as well as facilitate the further operation of the Medicare Shared Savings Program and accountable care organizations.\n\nNickels states that a \u201clegal safe zone\u201d needs to be implemented in order to further incentivize healthcare providers and payers to focus their efforts on adopting value-based care reimbursement models. Additionally, the AHA feels that the Stark law has an overarching theme of keeping \u201chospitals and physicians apart.\u201d\n\n\u201cCongress should adopt a single, broad exception that cuts across the Stark law, the anti-kickback statute and relevant CMPs for financial relationships designed to foster collaboration in the delivery of health care and incentivize and reward efficiencies and improvements in care. We recommend that the exception be created under the anti-kickback statute and arrangements protected under the exception be deemed compliant with the Stark law and relevant CMPs,\u201d the letter states.\n\nThe Stark law was created in a fee-for-service environment and the health payer world has been changing in recent years toward adopting value-based care reimbursement. With more primary care doctors, specialists, hospitals, and health insurers working toward improving the quality of care and reducing costs around the country, it would be beneficial for the federal government to put an end to regulatory barriers standing in the way of value-based care.\n\nAlong with a general move away from fee-for-service, health payers are using financial incentives to drive behavior among hospitals and healthcare networks. AHA further clarifies by explaining that \u201cthe two \u2018hallmarks\u2019 of acceptability under the Stark law \u2013 fair market value and commercial reasonableness \u2013 are not suited to the collaborative models that reward value and outcomes.\u201d\n\nJDSupra offered more clarification about the latest revisions of the Stark law. One exception added to the legislation is the timeshare arrangement. Essentially, this allows for entities to create timeshare arrangements with regard to supplies, office space, services and personnel.\n\nA secondary exception within the law is providing help in compensating non-physician practitioners, which includes nurse practitioners and physician assistants. This means that hospitals, clinics, and other healthcare centers can offer doctors financial assistance when they are employing or contracting non-physician practitioners to provide medical care to the physician\u2019s patient base.\n\nThe recent revisions to the Stark law also \u201crelaxed technical requirements\u201d that were geared toward decreasing the amount of self-disclosures presented to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). In particular, the revisions aimed to relax its requirements on violations that did not raise the \u201crisk of federal program abuse.\u201d\n\nWithin the healthcare industry, there has been some apprehension with regard to Stark law violations especially due to technical compliance violations. These new revisions of the legislation may lead to less fear of violations among the physician community. Congress would also benefit from reviewing the information about this legislation\u2019s effect on value-based care provided by the American Hospital Association.\n\n\u201cWhile originally intended to provide a \u201cbright line\u201d standard to assure hospitals and others clear guidance, the self-referral law has evolved into a series of increasingly complex, confusing and continually changing rules. Many involve form and audit-type requirements that carry the same weight as the core requirements of a legitimate arrangement for compliance purposes,\u201d Nickels declared in the letter.\n\n\u201cFair market value, commercial reasonableness and the volume/value prohibition are imbedded in the exceptions for compensation arrangements. The specter of relators and the relator\u2019s bar taking control of how to interpret the Stark law in service of achieving the financial bounties available under the False Claims Act, will no doubt chill, and could extinguish, the development of new relationships essential to the success of the new reimbursement models.\u201d\n\nAs the US Congress continues to seek input on revising and improving the Stark law, it is vital for health payers, providers, and medical organizations to come together and encourage the federal government to strip away regulatory barriers in an effort to strengthen value-based care reimbursement and new payment models.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The American Hospital Association has encouraged Congress to put an end to regulatory obstacles standing in the way of value-based care reimbursement.", "author": "HealthPayerIntelligence", "og": {"url": "http://healthpayerintelligence.com/news/aha-claims-stark-law-harms-value-based-care-reimbursement", "type": "article", "image": "http://healthpayerintelligence.com/images/site/articles/Money.jpg", "site_name": "HealthPayerIntelligence", "title": "AHA Claims Stark Law Harms Value-based Care Reimbursement"}, "twitter": {"description": "The American Hospital Association has encouraged Congress to put an end to regulatory obstacles standing in the way of value-based care reimbursement.", "title": "AHA Claims Stark Law Harms Value-based Care Reimbursement", "image": {"src": "http://healthpayerintelligence.com/images/site/articles/Money.jpg"}, "creator": "@", "site": "@", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index, follow", "msvalidate.01": "A4BC83422766F1B550D1E340B290BAC0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "The letter from AHA mentions that the Stark law may actually impede the implementation of new payment models that focus on value-based care reimbursement.\nIn particular, AHA seeks to provide more input on the physician self-referral law or Stark law.\nThe Stark law was created in a fee-for-service environment and the health payer world has been changing in recent years toward adopting value-based care reimbursement.\nCongress would also benefit from reviewing the information about this legislation\u2019s effect on value-based care provided by the American Hospital Association.\nNickels states that a \u201clegal safe zone\u201d needs to be implemented in order to further incentivize healthcare providers and payers to focus their efforts on adopting value-based care reimbursement models."}
