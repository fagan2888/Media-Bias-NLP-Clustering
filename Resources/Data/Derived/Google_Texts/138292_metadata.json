MST\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Hello, Arizona! (Applause.) Hey! (Applause.) Happy New Year, Arizona. (Applause.) Go, Bobcats. (Applause.)\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: We love you!\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: I love you back. (Applause.)\n\nIt\u2019s good to be in Phoenix. (Applause.) And I mean that, because I was in Detroit yesterday, which is a great city but it was 60 degrees colder. (Laughter.) So it feels pretty good, this weather right here. I had a couple staff people who said, we\u2019re going to miss the plane. (Laughter.) They\u2019re just going to try to get stranded here for a while. (Laughter.)\n\nBut I went to Detroit, I went here -- I guess between the Lions and the Cardinals, this is my post-wild card consolation tour. (Laughter.) As a Bears fan, I want you to know that, first of all, you guys did a lot better than we did. (Laughter.) You got a great coach; you got a great team. You had some bad luck. And there\u2019s always next year. So keep your chin up. Keep your chin up.\n\nI want to thank Secretary Castro not just for the terrific introduction, but for the great job he\u2019s doing every day. (Applause.) I want to thank your Congressman, Ruben Gallego. (Applause.) Where\u2019s Ruben? Where is he? Ruben, I already liked him, and then he told me he was from Chicago originally, before he got smart and moved to warmer weather (Laughter.)\n\nI want to thank your Mayor, Greg Stanton. (Applause.) He was there. There he is. Greg is doing a great job. I want to thank your principal, John Biera, Jr. (Applause.) And your superintendent, Kent Scribner. (Applause.) And I want to thank all the students and staff and faculty who may be here. We really appreciate your hospitality.\n\nOne last acknowledgement. I had a chance to meet a couple of really good friends -- Mark Kelly and Gabby Giffords. (Applause.) This was a remarkable meeting for me because it was four years ago today that Gabby and some other wonderful Arizonans were gunned down outside a supermarket in Tucson. It's a tough day for a lot of folks down there. We keep them in our thoughts and prayers.\n\nBut Gabby is doing great. She looks wonderful, and she\u2019s got the same energy and passion that she always has had. Even as she\u2019s waged her own fight to recover, she\u2019s fought to prevent the next tragedies from happening to others. She\u2019s a hero, and she is a great Arizonan. (Applause.) So we\u2019re really proud of her. And her brother, who is also an astronaut -- her brother-in-law, who\u2019s also an astronaut, is going to be in space for a year. He was just on the cover of Time Magazine, which I know there\u2019s some folks in Washington who wish I was going to be in space for a year, but -- (laughter) -- but I'm still around. (Applause.) Because I got some work to do.\n\nNow, I am here because one of my New Year\u2019s resolutions is to make sure more Americans in Phoenix and in Arizona and all across the country feel like they\u2019re coming back. Because the country is coming back, but I want everybody to feel like things are getting better and we are moving in the right direction. And let there be no doubt -- thanks to the steps we took early on to rescue our economy, to rebuild it on a new foundation, America is coming back. (Applause.)\n\nAnd that\u2019s not just my own opinion. Here are the facts. 2014 was the strongest year for job growth since the 1990s. (Applause.) We\u2019ve had 57 straight months of private sector job growth, created nearly 11 million new jobs. (Applause.) Since 2010, we\u2019ve put more people back to work than Europe, Japan, and every advanced economy combined. (Applause.) American manufacturing is growing at the fastest pace since the \u201890s. We\u2019re now the number-one producer of oil, of gas. And by the way, you\u2019re saving about a buck-ten a gallon at the pump over this time last year. (Applause.)\n\nAlthough I was in Detroit and I told folks yesterday, gas prices aren\u2019t going to be low forever, so don\u2019t start suddenly saying you don\u2019t have to worry about fuel efficiency. If you\u2019re going out shopping for a new car, don\u2019t think it\u2019s always going to be this low, because then you\u2019ll be surprised and you\u2019ll be mad at me later -- (laughter) -- and I\u2019ll be able to say, I told you don\u2019t get a gas guzzler because gas is going to go back up. But while it\u2019s low, enjoy it. And feel free to spend some of that money on local businesses, who then will hire more people and put more folks back to work. (Applause.)\n\nMeanwhile, thanks to the Affordable Care Act, about 10 million Americans have gained health insurance in the past year alone. (Applause.)\n\nWe\u2019ve done all this while cutting our federal deficit by about two-thirds. And I\u2019m going to repeat that, because they did a poll the other day and like 70 percent of the people think the deficit is going up. No, 70 percent of the people. You stop people on the street -- 7 out of 10 think the deficit is going up. The deficit has gone down by two-thirds since I was President of the United States. (Applause.) So we\u2019re doing all this in a fiscally responsible way. (Applause.)\n\nAnd maybe closest to my heart, after 13 long years, our war in Afghanistan has come to a responsible end, which means more of our brave troops spent time with their families this holiday season, right here back home. (Applause.)\n\nSo these last six years required hard work and sacrifice by everybody. But as a country, we have a right to be proud that all that hard work paid off. America\u2019s resurgence is real. And now that we\u2019ve got some calmer waters out there, if everybody does their part, if we all work together, we can make sure that the tide starts lifting all boats again. We can get wages and incomes growing faster. We can make sure the middle class is growing, that the ladders of the middle class for folks who are struggling are firm and steady and have a lot of rungs to them. Because it\u2019s the middle class, it\u2019s working families that power America\u2019s prosperity. That\u2019s always been the case; that will be true for decades to come. (Applause.)\n\nAnd I\u2019ve got a State of the Union address in about two weeks and that\u2019s what I want to talk about -- building on the progress we\u2019ve made. But of course, why wait for the State of the Union? It\u2019s sort of like you\u2019ve got presents under the tree, you kind of start shaking them a little bit. (Laughter.) I want to kind of give you a little sense of what I want to talk about. So we\u2019re going to start this week laying out some of the agenda for the next year.\n\nAnd here in Phoenix, I want to talk about helping more families afford their piece of the American Dream, and that is owning their own home. (Applause.)\n\nNow, let me just say, right now Michelle and I live in rental housing. (Laughter.) We don\u2019t own where we live. We\u2019ve got two years remaining on our lease. (Laughter.) I\u2019m hoping I get my security deposit back. (Laughter.) Although Bo and Sunny have been tearing things up occasionally -- we\u2019re going to have to clean things up a little bit. (Laughter.)\n\nBut I\u2019ll never forget the day we bought our first place, a place of our own -- a condo, back in Chicago. And for us, and millions of Americans like us, buying a home has always been about more than owning a roof and four walls. It\u2019s about investing in savings, and building a family, and planting roots in a community. So we bought this place -- it was about, I guess, probably about 2,000 square feet. It was in this complex called East View Park. It was sort of like a railway apartment. And it felt huge when we moved in. And then Malia and Sasha were born, and their toys got everywhere. (Laughter.) And then it felt small because they basically took over the whole dining room with their toys.\n\nBut I have such good memories not just about the place itself, but all the work we had to do to save to get in there, and then to fix it up, and that sense of accomplishment that you were building something for your family and for your future.\n\nAnd that's always been true. When my grandfather came back from World War II, this country gave him the chance to buy his first home with a loan from the FHA. For folks like him, a home was proof that America was a place where if you worked hard, if you were responsible, it was rewarded.\n\nBut we all know what happened in the last decade when responsibility gave way to recklessness. Families who did the right thing and bought a home that they could afford, and made their payments each month, and did everything right, when the market plummeted they got hurt. Even though somebody else was acting irresponsibly -- whether on Wall Street, or folks who weren\u2019t responsible in terms of how they were dealing with their real estate -- ordinary families got hurt bad. And that was especially true here in Arizona.\n\nThere were folks who borrowed more than they should have. There were lenders who really were just worried about making profits and not whether the people they were lending to were going to be able to keep up their homes. So home values plunged. Americans sank underwater. Foreclosures skyrocketed. Builders stopped building. Construction workers lost their jobs.\n\nAnd when I came into office, I believed we could not let this crisis play itself out. If we could save more families from losing everything they had worked so hard to build, we had to make the effort. So less than a month after I took office, I came here to Arizona to lay out my plan to get responsible homeowners back on their feet. And I said that healing our housing market wouldn\u2019t be easy, it would not be quick. But we were going to act swiftly, we were going to act boldly, we were going to try everything that we could to help responsible homeowners. If something didn't work, we\u2019d try something else. But we were going to try to keep folks in their homes.\n\nAnd we ended up helping millions stay in their homes. We helped millions more save thousands of dollars each year by refinancing. We helped folks who didn\u2019t want to buy a home or who weren\u2019t ready to buy find an affordable place to rent. We kept up our fight against homelessness. And by the way -- there\u2019s some homeless advocates here -- since 2010, we\u2019ve helped bring one in three homeless veterans off the streets. (Applause.) And I want to make sure everybody knows -- under Mayor Stanton, Phoenix is leading the way in that effort. (Applause.) Phoenix is doing a great job. (Applause.)\n\nSo as a result of all these efforts, today, home sales are up nearly 50 percent from where they were in the worst of the crisis. Homebuilding has more than doubled. That's created hundreds of thousands of construction jobs. New foreclosures are at their lowest level since 2006. Since 2012, nearly 10 million fewer Americans have their homes underwater. Rising home prices have put hundreds of billions of dollars of wealth back in the pockets of middle-class families.\n\nNow, I want everybody to be clear -- this progress is not an accident. It is not luck. It\u2019s what happens when you have policies that put middle-class families first. (Applause.)\n\nAnd what\u2019s true in Arizona is true all across the country: We\u2019ve still got some more work to do, our job is not done, but what we're doing is working. And we\u2019ve got to keep at it. We\u2019ve got to stay at it.\n\nToday, here in Phoenix, I\u2019m going to take a new action to help even more responsible families stake their claim on the middle class and buy their first new home. Starting this month, the Federal Housing Authority will lower its mortgage insurance premium rates enough to save the average new borrower more than $900 a year. (Applause.) Now, that's $900 that can go towards paying the groceries, or gas, or a child\u2019s education. Or, depending on what your mortgage is, it might be a month\u2019s mortgage payment.\n\nAnd for those who aren\u2019t familiar with FHA, FHA underwrites, it guarantees, it\u2019s the backstop for a lot of loans around the country, especially for middle-class folks. So a lot of people pay these fees, and if they\u2019re saving $900 that\u2019s money that\u2019s going to be going throughout the economy.\n\nOver the next three years, these lower premiums will give hundreds of thousands more families the chance to own their own home, and it will help make owning a home more affordable for millions more households overall in the coming years.\n\nAnd just to give you an example, earlier today, Secretary Castro and I visited Nueva Villas. It\u2019s a new neighborhood here in Phoenix where a lot of families are buying homes with the help of the FHA. And we actually -- this was a big development that wasn\u2019t finished or wasn\u2019t all sold; the crisis came, half the homes were still unsold. Folks lost their homes. It started getting boarded up. People were feeling insecure. It was starting to get depressed. Nonprofits, with the help of HUD, came in, purchased some of the properties, hired local residents to rehab them. Now people are building them -- beautiful homes. And with the help of the FHA, we can now make sure that more people are getting access to these homes. And today\u2019s action will mean more money in the pockets of families like the ones that we\u2019ve met.\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible.)\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Is this about housing? (Laughter.) All right.\n\nAnd keep in mind, hundreds of thousands of new buyers is going to mean a healthier housing market for everybody. So how many people here own their own home? (Applause.) All right. So even though you\u2019ve already got your mortgage or your loan, already have your home, if your neighbors are buying more homes, that\u2019s lifting the whole market here, which means the value of your home starts going up. And that\u2019s good for you. (Applause.) It means fewer foreclosure signs as people fix up old properties. It means more construction, which means more jobs, which means a better economy. So this is the kind of boost that we need to keep the momentum that we have seen over the last several years -- keep it going here in Phoenix and all across the country.\n\nSo I want to be clear. If you\u2019re looking to take advantage of these lower rates, that\u2019s great. On the other hand, don\u2019t buy something you can\u2019t afford. (Applause.) You\u2019re going to be out of luck. These rates are for responsible buyers. We\u2019re not going down the road again of financing folks buying things they can\u2019t afford. We\u2019re going to be cracking down on that. We put in place tough rules on Wall Street and we created a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and we\u2019re really policing irresponsible lenders luring folks into buying stuff they can\u2019t afford. (Applause.)\n\nAnd we designed a mortgage form that\u2019s written in simple language so that people understand what the commitments are when you buy a home. We\u2019re cracking down on some of the worst practices that led to the housing crisis. We\u2019re going to protect middle-class families from getting ripped off.\n\nAnd that\u2019s why we had the Justice Department fight for buyers who were discriminated against or preyed upon, and we won a settlement that awarded more money to victims in one year than in the previous 23 years combined. (Applause.) That\u2019s why we worked with states to force big banks to repay more than $50 billion to more than 1.5 million borrowers who had been treated wrongly -- and that was the largest lending settlement in history. (Applause.) And that\u2019s why I\u2019ve called on Congress to wind down the government-backed companies known as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.\n\nSo the bottom line is we don't think there\u2019s anything wrong with pursuing a profit, but we want to make clear the days of making bad bets on the backs of taxpayer money and then getting bailed out afterwards -- we're not going back to that. (Applause.) We've worked too hard, and everything we\u2019ve done to heal the housing markets we want to preserve. But we do want to make sure that the housing market is strong and that responsible homeowners can get a good deal. For people who have saved, done the right thing, now are looking to buy their first home, we want to make sure that they get a little bit of help.\n\nIn the end, everything we've done to heal the housing market is about more than just restoring housing values. It's about restoring our common values. It's about who we are as a country and who we are as communities.\n\nAnd I want to just tell you a quick story. Lorraine Cona, from Sun City, next door, she did everything right. She had a good job as a librarian. She bought a home she could afford. She wanted to retire in that home. She made her payments on time. Then, five years ago, through no fault of her own, she was laid off, and she started falling behind in her payments. She knew foreclosure was coming. She said, \u201cI\u2019d look out the window and I\u2019d see somebody taking pictures of my house.\u201d\n\nBut when things seemed darkest, Lorraine learned about something called the Hardest Hit fund \u2013- it's a program that we created to help folks in states like Arizona that had been especially hard hit by the real estate crash. And they helped her make her late payments -- because she had a great track record until she had lost her job. They set her up with financial counseling so she could stay on track. It wasn\u2019t easy, but Lorraine repaired her credit. She refinanced her mortgage. And today, after a lifetime of hard work, Lorraine is retired, she\u2019s back to making her payments every single month. She\u2019s in her home. She was able to accomplish that. Even though it was scary at times, she got it done. Lorraine came back, just like Phoenix has come back. (Applause.) Just like Arizona has come back. Just like America has come back. (Applause.)\n\nIt\u2019s not just the economy turning around. It\u2019s turning around the lives of hardworking people, making sure that that hard work finally pays off. (Applause.) It\u2019s making sure you finally get that job you\u2019re looking for, or the raise you deserve, or a little bit of security, or the retirement that you\u2019ve earned, or being able to send your kid to college so their lives are better than yours. (Applause.) That's what this is about.\n\nSo I just want everybody to know that we have been through some tough times, but we are moving. There are workers today with jobs who didn\u2019t have jobs last year. There are families who have got health insurance who didn\u2019t have health insurance before. (Applause.) There are students who are in college right now who didn\u2019t think they could afford it before. (Applause.) There are heroes who had served tour after tour who are finally home with their families. There are autoworkers who are building great American cars now when they thought that those plants were going to shut down.\n\nAmerica is coming back. (Applause.) And the key, Arizona, is for us all to work together to make sure we keep it going.\n\n\n\nThank you, everybody. God bless you. God bless America. (Applause.)\n\nEND\n\n11:29 A.M.
