HOLYOKE -- It's National Children's Dental Health Month and at the Holyoke Health Center, that means there's a scavenger hunt.

"The participants are encouraged to complete each task of the scavenger hunt which includes oral health education, dental-themed crafts and an oral exam, and as a reward for completing each task they receive free prizes and giveaways," said a press release from Holyoke Health Center, 230 Maple St.

The activity is part of the "Dental Adventure" the center is holding Feb. 17 and 18 to highlight the importance to parents and children of dental health, the press release said.

Events will be held 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. both days on all floors of the health center, the press release said.

Center staff will discuss oral health education, dental exams and creative oral health crafts with parents and children.

"The health center will be providing full-service pediatric dental including oral exams, X-Rays/imaging, sealants, and fluoride treatments," the press release said.

"Throughout this event, participants will get the opportunity to experience all the dental health services that are provided at Holyoke Health Center by participating in a scavenger hunt throughout the facility," the press release said.

The center opened a Pediatric Dental Wing that features 13 dental chairs for children in September 2013 with a federal Affordable Care Act grant of nearly $2 million.

The American Dental Association sponsors National Children's Dental Health Month in February to raise awareness about the importance of oral health, its website said.
