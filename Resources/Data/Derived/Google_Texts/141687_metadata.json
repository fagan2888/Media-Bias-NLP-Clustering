The congressional wing is thriving, especially in the South, in districts that are 75 percent, or even 80 percent, white, and where every incumbent\u2019s worst fear is a challenge from the right. But McInturff summed up the national party\u2019s prospects with an old line from Mr. T in \u201cRocky III\u201d: \u201cPrediction? Pain!\u201d He said the party\u2019s \u201cgenetic instinct\u201d is that younger voters don\u2019t vote, and too many Republicans don\u2019t understand the coming demographic wave. \u201cWhy am I a Republican?\u201d he asked. \u201cI believe in the power of markets. The marketplace is, you will lose \u2014 keep losing national elections \u2014 until you keep up.\u201d\n\nI wonder if Republican pollsters were telling them the same thing in, say, 1966, when the demographics looked like this:\n\nNow that was a demographic time bomb that encompassed the most radical left-wing young generation in history. And guess what happened? A powerful conservative movement happened that culminated in the election of Ronald Reagan just 14 years later. Perhaps it\u2019s not genetics that is determining their behavior but rather their own experience.\n\nThis is not to say that millennials will not be much more liberal than their baby boomer forebears turned out to be, but it would likely have been predicted by many after 1964 that the Republicans had better figure out how to cater to \u201cthe youth\u201d or they were doomed. But they didn\u2019t. They catered to fear and resentment and anger and loss and they built their movement around it.\n\nAnd yes, these are different times with a very different culture. Nothing ever plays itself out exactly the same way twice. Instead of a period of cynicism and lost faith, like the 1970s, perhaps the next decade will be one of high hopes and renewed idealism and that will motivate the youth to work for progress, unlike their disappointing boomer parents and grandparents who pretty much succumbed to liberal disillusionment. But it\u2019s probably a mistake to believe that it is inevitable. Tough times can make people more expansive and idealistic or it can make them more mean and insular. And considering the challenges we face with climate change, income inequality, money in politics and extremism of all stripes, there\u2019s a good chance that we\u2019re going to have some tough times ahead.\n\nNone of this is to say that Republicans are going to win the presidency any time soon. For the moment it appears that the Democrats hold the majority on a national basis. But conservatives tend to have more patience than liberals and they may very well think the status quo is just fine. After all, with the exception of Obamacare (granted, a big exception) they\u2019ve been getting everything they want as an extremist minority party.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Conventional wisdom says Republicans need to evolve and get younger.
