A Panama City Beach restaurant has once again turned its profits into plowshares for three local charities.

Representatives from beach care services, basic of Northwest Florida and Paws and Claws gathered at the restaurant to accept their share of the proceeds.

Pineapple Willy's presented checks to each of the three charities. The restaurant raised over 82,000 dollars from profits from food sales during the previous week . For some of the charities it meant serving more people and for others it meant filling a gap in their funding.

"Pineapple Willy's has been wonderful to us. We love them for it. They have helped so many animals survive, said donator Valerie Mincey.

"The event enables us to help clients pay those co-pays. Access those medications that are not available to them through grants," said Debi Knight of Beach Care Services.

Knight goes on to say, "This is tremendous. I just want Bill Buskell and Pineapple Willy's every year. The support that he shows as a business man, and like he says pay it forward."

Pineapple Willy's does this every year at this time to help local people when they most need help.
