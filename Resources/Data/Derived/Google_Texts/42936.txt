Chris Picco unexpectedly lost his wife Ashley–and just days later, he also lost their son, Lennon, who was born in an emergency c-section.

According to Lifestyle Magazine, “during Ashley’s pregnancy, she’d feel Lennon moving to music, so she asked her husband to bring his guitar to the hospital and play for him when he was born.”

Picco, a musician, honored her wish. In a now-viral video, he sings the Beatles’ song ‘Blackbird’ to his son.

Lennon passed away hours later.

A memorial fund to help with medical expenses set up by friends of the family, The Ashley Picco Memorial Fund, has already exceeded its fundraising goal.
