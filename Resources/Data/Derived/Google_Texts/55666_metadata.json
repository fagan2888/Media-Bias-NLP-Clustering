All photos of his \u00a37,500 honeymoon, along with about 15 years worth of contact information he had accumulated, were accidentally purged from his phone by a store employee, he said.\n\n\u201cMy wife was in tears and I started crying when I realized what had gone,\u201d Mr. White said in court, The Sun reported. \u201cMy life was saved on that phone. I lost my favorite video of a giant tortoise biting my hand on honeymoon in the Seychelles.\u201d\n\nMr. White initially asked Apple to pay him \u00a37,000 in damages, then lowered his demands to a new computer screen and printer worth about \u00a31,000. Apple wouldn\u2019t settle out of court, however, and insisted on bringing the issue before a judge.\n\n\u201cThis could easily have been settled if common sense had come into the arena,\u201d Judge Fine said. \u201cApple has failed to act at all appropriately during these proceedings and has been totally unreasonable.\u201d\n\nMr. Whitetold The Sun that he hopes the ruling against Apple \u201chas wiped the smirk off their faces.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Apple has been ordered to pay more than $3,000 to a London man who said he was driven to tears after his honeymoon pictures and other personal files were erased from his phone during a routine repair.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Apple has been ordered to pay more than $3,000 to a London man who said he was driven to tears after his honeymoon pictures and other personal files were erased from his phone during a routine repair.", "title": "Apple ordered to pay $3K for deleting customer\u2019s iPhone pics", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/dec/1/apple-ordered-pay-3k-deleting-customers-iphone-pic/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/09/25/9809a62d219ff92b820f6a706700d52e.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/09/25/9809a62d219ff92b820f6a706700d52e.jpg", "description": "Apple has been ordered to pay more than $3,000 to a London man who said he was driven to tears after his honeymoon pictures and other personal files were erased from his phone during a routine repair.", "card": "summary", "title": "Apple ordered to pay $3K for deleting customer\u2019s iPhone pics"}, "Author": "Andrew Blake", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Law Crime, Technology Internet, Deric White"}, "article_summary": "Apple has been ordered to pay more than $3,000 to a London man who said he was driven to tears after his honeymoon pictures and other personal files were erased from his phone during a routine repair.\nApple wouldn\u2019t settle out of court, however, and insisted on bringing the issue before a judge.\n\u201cMy wife was in tears and I started crying when I realized what had gone,\u201d Mr. White said in court, The Sun reported.\n\u201cApple has failed to act at all appropriately during these proceedings and has been totally unreasonable.\u201dMr. Whitetold The Sun that he hopes the ruling against Apple \u201chas wiped the smirk off their faces.\u201d\n\u201cThis could easily have been settled if common sense had come into the arena,\u201d Judge Fine said."}
