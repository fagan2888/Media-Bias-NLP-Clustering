Salt Lake City police say several people were arrested for throwing rocks and bottles at police after officers shot a male wielding a broomstick Saturday night.

Mayor Jackie Biskupski of Salt Lake City says the police shooting of a male wielding a broomstick is a tragedy.

Biskupski said in a statement Sunday that she's asked the police department to release as much information as possible about the Saturday night shooting, which left the male in critical condition Sunday.

Biskupski says the shooting is the third police use of force in the past month. She's asking the department to review each incident to determine if officers could have de-escalated the situations.

Detective Greg Wilking had few details Sunday about the shooting or identities of those involved but said police planned to release more information later Sunday.

Wilking did not know exactly how many people were arrested for throwing objects at police after the shooting.

He says officers cleared several streets surrounding the area and asked bystanders to leave. He says the unrest only went on for a matter of minutes but police closed down streets for hours.

The Unified Police Department is investigating the shooting.

Unified Police Detective Ken Hansen says there were pockets of civil disturbance from angry bystanders for several hours afterward.
