They were expected to make initial court appearances later Thursday in the districts in which they were arrested.\n\nMoore is a notorious character as a result of his creation and operation of the now-defunct revenge porn website isanyoneup.com. The BBC several years ago named him the \"most-hated man on the Internet.\"\n\nBoth men are charged in the 15-count federal grand jury indictment with conspiracy, seven counts of unauthorized access to a protected computer to obtain information and seven counts of aggravated identity theft.\n\n\u201cThe moral of the story is that his revenge porn site wasn\u2019t a good enough business model, and that he had to engage in illegal activity to populate the site with pictures,\u201d said Wes Hsu, assistant U.S. attorney for the Central District of California and head of the office\u2019s Cyber and Intellectual Property Crime Section.\n\nNeither the defendants nor their attorneys could immediately be reached by NBC News for comment.\n\nIf convicted, Moore and Evens each face a maximum of up to five years in federal prison on the conspiracy and computer hacking counts, prosecutors said. Additionally, the aggravated identity theft carries a mandatory two-year sentence, which would be served consecutively to any other sentence.\n\nCharlotte Laws' daughter was the victim of photo hacking at the hands of the now-defunct site isanyoneup.com. Laws, who has been called the \"Erin Brockovich of revenge porn\" discusses how she took down the person who posted pictures of her daughter.\n\nAccording to the 13-page indictment, there were least eight primary victims of the conspiracy, described only by their initials. \u201cNude images of (the victims) \u2026 and others\u201d were posted on Moore\u2019s site, isanyoneup.com, it said.\n\nThe indictment also alleges Evens gained access to the email accounts of \u201chundreds of victims by various means, including by \u2018hacking.\u2019\u201d\n\nProsecutors said Moore\u2019s site featured \u201crevenge porn,\u201d where \u201cnude or explicit photos of victims (were) submitted by other individuals without the victim\u2019s permission for purposes of revenge.\u201d\n\nMoore needed more material for his site and conspired with Evens, starting at an unknown date and continuing through May 2, 2012, to illegally gain access to victim\u2019s computers to obtain more photos, prosecutors said.\n\nMoore allegedly instructed Evens to gain unauthorized access to victims\u2019 email accounts and sent payments to Evens in exchange for nude photos he obtained, according to the indictment. Moore then posted the illegally obtained photos on his website, without the victims\u2019 consent, it said.\n\nIn an interview on \"MSNBC Live with Thomas Roberts\" in December, activist and mom Charlotte Walls described how a hacker gained access to compromising photos of hundreds of people across the country, including her daughter, first through Facebook and then by getting into her email account.\n\n\u201cPeople are being humiliated, hurt,\u201d said Walls, who helped push through a California law banning revenge porn. \u201cThe people on the website then harassed the particular individual who is a victim on the site and tried to get her fired from her job, trying to ruin her job essentially. It\u2019s really a horrendous thing that happens.\u201d\n\nHsu said the case offers a good lesson for email users.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a reminder to everybody that you have to be diligent when you set up your passwords and security questions,\u201d Hsu said. \u201cI think people take for granted that nobody is going to bother trying to get into their email account. I view it is a very important, private thing for most people. Everybody should make themselves as hard a target as possible.\u201d\n\nMore from NBC News Investigations:\n\nFollow NBC News Investigations on Twitter and Facebook", "article_metadata": {"description": "Two California men \u2013 including the creator and operator of a so-called \u201crevenge porn\u201d website -- were charged Thursday with computer crimes and ID theft stemming from an alleged conspiracy to hack into email accounts and ste", "author": "Investigations", "og": {"site_name": "NBC News", "description": "Two California men &ndash; including the creator and operator of a so-called &ldquo;revenge porn&rdquo; website -- were charged Thursday with computer crimes and ID theft stemming from an alleged conspiracy to hack into email accounts and ste", "title": "'Revenge porn' site creator, alleged hacker charged with computer crime, ID theft", "url": "http://investigations.nbcnews.com/_news/2014/01/23/22418229-revenge-porn-site-creator-alleged-hacker-charged-with-computer-crime-id-theft", "image": "http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/__NEW/n_roberts_c_131202.vmodv4.jpg", "type": "article"}, "contentId": 22418229, "section": "{\"domainName\":\"investigations\",\"displayName\":\"Investigations\",\"avatar\":\"http:\\/\\/nvcdn.nbcnews.com\\/_vine\\/images\\/av\\/30x30\\/group.gif\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/investigations.nbcnews.com\\/\",\"type\":\"group\",\"ass\":\"\",\"groupId\":\"5187\",\"articleCount\":\"1225\",\"seedCount\":\"147\",\"memberCount\":\"4\",\"description\":\"\",\"createDate\":1279868940,\"groupType\":null,\"groupTypeId\":\"5\",\"blessed\":0,\"lastPub\":1460216486,\"isEnabled\":1}", "title": "'Revenge porn' site creator, alleged hacker charged with computer crime, ID theft - Investigations", "trackData": "{\"section\":\"US news\",\"subSection\":\"Open Channel\",\"sitePageId\":\"a22418229\",\"headline\":\"'Revenge porn' site creator, alleged hacker charged with computer crime, ID theft\",\"pageSource\":\"Investigations\",\"typeName\":\"Story\",\"byline\":\"Investigations\",\"tags\":[\"id-theft\",\"computer-crime\",\"revenge-porn\"],\"seedSource\":\"\"}", "jenga-session-config": "{\"when_to_init\":\"asap\", \"load_pers\":\"1\"}", "cip": "204.2.187.38", "nv": {"contentId": 22418229, "contentType": "n"}, "date": "May 23, 2016, 7:24 pm", "server": "web07", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "canonical": "http://investigations.nbcnews.com/_news/2014/01/23/22418229-revenge-porn-site-creator-alleged-hacker-charged-with-computer-crime-id-theft"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0ee9\"", "article_summary": "Moore is a notorious character as a result of his creation and operation of the now-defunct revenge porn website isanyoneup.com.\n\u201cPeople are being humiliated, hurt,\u201d said Walls, who helped push through a California law banning revenge porn.\nLaws, who has been called the \"Erin Brockovich of revenge porn\" discusses how she took down the person who posted pictures of her daughter.\nTwo California men \u2013 including the creator and operator of a so-called \u201crevenge porn\u201d website -- were charged Thursday with computer crimes and ID theft stemming from an alleged conspiracy to hack into email accounts and steal nude photos that were later posted on the Internet site.\n\u201cNude images of (the victims) \u2026 and others\u201d were posted on Moore\u2019s site, isanyoneup.com, it said."}
