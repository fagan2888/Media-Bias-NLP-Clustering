CREDIT: Kickstarter The promotional video for a proposed investigative project on factory farms\n\nAre aerial drones the answer we need to a wave of state laws seeking to criminalize efforts to expose health hazards and inhumane practices on corporate farms? One animal rights activist thinks so, and he\u2019s won over hundreds of supporters who have donated money to help him prove his point.\n\nWill Potter, a journalist who focuses on issues related to animal rights and civil liberties, recently launched a Kickstarter campaign to to raise money to finance a drone investigation of the country\u2019s notoriously shady factory farms. \u201cIn my new project, I am going to use new investigative journalism tools to help expose what some corporations want to keep hidden. With your support, I will lawfully document factory farms in multiple states using aerial drone photography,\u201d Potter explains on his fundraising page. He met his $30,000 goal in just five days.\n\nPotter\u2019s project is in direct response to so-called \u201cag gag\u201d laws, which prevent activists from exposing inhumane practices within the agricultural industry. This type of legislation, which is pushed by the right-wing American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), has steadily spread across the country over the past several years. Idaho was the latest state to enact an ag-gag law, and that measure is currently being challenged by several groups who say it will ultimately undermine animal and food safety.\n\nUndercover investigations have a proven history of leading to change within the industry. In 2008, a Humane Society video documented a California slaughterhouse abusing and killing sick cattle, which led to the largest beef recall in U.S. history and the largest penalty ever awarded for an animal abuse case.\n\nPotter says he was inspired by a photography project that took aerial shots of industrial farming operations. Those shots exposed the potential health and environmental hazards posed by commercial cattle feedlots. Farms haven\u2019t been pleased about the rise of aerial photography, and have attempted to crack down on people taking shots from above \u2014 which made Potter wonder what exactly they\u2019re trying to hide.\n\n\u201cWill a drone allow us to see the scope of pollution caused by these industrial operations? I\u2019m going to find out,\u201d Potter writes. His Kickstarter notes that his investigation will eventually be turned into a book and a documentary.\n\nIn a recent interview with Salon, Potter said he\u2019s had a really positive reaction for his campaign, which \u201cseems to really resonate with people.\u201d A lot of people were intrigued by his idea, even if they hadn\u2019t followed these agricultural issues closely before. One particularly generous donor recently agreed to match any donations over $45,000 that Potter\u2019s project takes in.\n\nUnmanned aerial systems, or drones, have become notorious for their implications for privacy invasions and human rights abuses. But they\u2019re increasingly being used in other ways, too \u2014 and in 2015, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) will open up American airspace for the commercial use of drones. So far, drones have been approved to improve disaster relief and monitor oil drilling. They\u2019ve also helped companies like Amazon and Dominoes hype up their businesses by suggesting they might start delivering via drones.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Spurred by the so-called \"ag-gag\" laws that are criminalizing whistleblowing in the agricultural industry, one journalist has an unusual idea.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "Spurred by the so-called \"ag-gag\" laws that are criminalizing whistleblowing in the agricultural industry, one journalist has an unusual idea.", "title": "Could Drones Finally Expose One Of The Country\u2019s Most Secretive Industries?", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2014/06/27/3454235/drones-factory-farms/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/drone.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Spurred by the so-called \"ag-gag\" laws that are criminalizing whistleblowing in the agricultural industry, one journalist has an unusual idea.", "creator": "@Tara_CR", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/drone-321x214.jpg", "title": "Could Drones Finally Expose One Of The Country\u2019s Most Secretive Industries?", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/drone.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/drone.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-27T13:53:47+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/tculpressler"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "Health Could Drones Finally Expose One Of The Country\u2019s Most Secretive Industries?\nOne animal rights activist thinks so, and he\u2019s won over hundreds of supporters who have donated money to help him prove his point.\nPotter says he was inspired by a photography project that took aerial shots of industrial farming operations.\nWith your support, I will lawfully document factory farms in multiple states using aerial drone photography,\u201d Potter explains on his fundraising page.\nThey\u2019ve also helped companies like Amazon and Dominoes hype up their businesses by suggesting they might start delivering via drones."}
