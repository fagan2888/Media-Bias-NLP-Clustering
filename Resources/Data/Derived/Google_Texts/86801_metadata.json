Then they spent the next 40 years rewriting one of them into a license for employers to exploit their workers. Along the way, the justices held that a woman could be cut up against her will and sterilized. And they endorsed laws making criticism of the nation\u2019s wartime policies a crime.\n\nI lay out much of this history in my new book, Injustices: The Supreme Court\u2019s History of Comforting the Comfortable and Afflicting the Afflicted, where I also discuss the warning signs that modern-day justices are beginning to repeat the sins of their predecessors. Yet, despite these warning signs, it is easy to dismiss the Supreme Court\u2019s past as, well, the past. The United States has done many terrible things in its history, from slavery to the Trail of Tears to Jim Crow. That doesn\u2019t mean that we are likely to relegalize the sale of human beings any time soon.\n\nJustice Ruth Bader Ginsburg recently celebrated her 82nd birthday, only a few days after Justice Antonin Scalia celebrated his 79th. Justice Anthony Kennedy is 78 years-old, while Justice Stephen Breyer is 76. The next president, in other words, could replace nearly half of the Court\u2019s members in a single presidential term.\n\nWhat\u2019s important to understand about the Supreme Court, however, is that it has almost always acted as a malign force in American history \u2014 and the brief period from the mid-1950s through the mid-1970s that liberals now look back upon with nostalgia was both an anomaly and the culmination of several historic accidents.\n\nTwo other factors also create a significant risk that the Court\u2019s future could look a great deal like the dark moments of its past. The first is that the Republican Party has largely rejected the cries for judicial restraint that dominated its rhetoric during the Nixon, Reagan, and both Bush administrations. And this shift towards conservative judicial activism is being cheered on by powerful elements within the legal profession.\n\nThe second factor is that the Court\u2019s membership could change rapidly in just a few years. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg recently celebrated her 82nd birthday, only a few days after Justice Antonin Scalia celebrated his 79th. Justice Anthony Kennedy is 78 years-old, while Justice Stephen Breyer is 76. The next president, in other words, could replace nearly half of the Court\u2019s members in a single presidential term \u2014 potentially filling the Court with justices eager to relive the Court\u2019s excesses from nearly a century ago.\n\nThe Good Scalia\n\nIt\u2019s not hard to remember a time when conservatives feared a Supreme Court run amok at least as much as liberals. President Ronald Reagan promised to appoint judges who embrace \u201cjudicial restraint.\u201d President George W. Bush warned that judges who \u201cgive in to temptation and make law instead of interpreting\u201d engage in \u201cjudicial lawlessness\u201d that is a \u201cthreat to our democracy.\u201d Chief Justice John Roberts told senators during his confirmation hearing that he would \u201cprefer to be known as a modest judge.\u201d\n\nOne of the most articulate spokespersons for this fear of a too-powerful judiciary used to be Justice Scalia. A judge\u2019s power, Scalia warned in a 1998 book, can consist \u201cof playing king \u2014 devising, out of the brilliance of one\u2019s own mind, those laws that ought to govern mankind.\u201d The power of judges to reason their way to a desired result, Scalia archly explained, \u201cwould be an unqualified good, were it not for a trend in government that has developed in recent centuries, called democracy.\u201d\n\nThe power of judges to reason their way to a desired result . . . \u201cwould be an unqualified good, were it not for a trend in government that has developed in recent centuries, called democracy.\u201d\n\nIndeed, as a younger man, Scalia built a judicial philosophy around the belief that judicial discretion must be constrained. In a 1989 lecture entitled \u201cOriginalism: The Lesser Evil,\u201d Scalia argued that \u201cthe main danger in judicial interpretation of the Constitution \u2014 or, for that matter, in judicial interpretation of any law \u2014 is that the judges will mistake their own predilections for the law.\u201d To combat this danger, Scalia embraced originalism \u2014 the theory that a legal text\u2019s true meaning must be determined by examining how it would have been understood at the time of its enactment \u2014 because he believed that originalism \u201cestablishes a historical criterion that is conceptually quite separate from the preferences of the judge himself.\u201d\n\nThe strongest case for Scalia\u2019s avowed approach to the law has always been that it will enable judges to base their decisions on neutral principles separate from their own desires.\n\nThe Bad Scalia\n\nIn practice, however, Scalia\u2019s proved quite incapable of living up to his own ideal of judicial decision-making untainted by personal preferences. In his 2005 opinion in Gonzales v. Raich, for example, Scalia offered an expansive interpretation of congressional power \u2014 an interpretation that was clearly expansive enough to permit the Affordable Care Act. Yet Scalia was one of four justices who voted to repeal this act in its entirety just seven years later. Similarly, Scalia co-authored a 2012 book which explains that \u201cno interpretive fault is more common than the failure to follow the whole-text canon, which calls on the judicial interpreter to consider the entire text\u201d when interpreting a statute. Yet, at oral arguments in another case seeking to gut the Affordable Care Act, Scalia appeared determined to repeat this \u201cinterpretative fault\u201d himself.\n\nScalia is, in many ways, a microcosm for the conservative movement as a whole, which has grown increasingly comfortable with aggressive judicial activism as the Supreme Court has moved to the right.\n\nI argue in Injustices that the ethic of judicial restraint that dominated conservative judicial thinking in the late Twentieth Century was an anomaly. In the middle part of that century, the Supreme Court consistently moved the law in a more liberal direction for the first and only time in the Court\u2019s history. Decisions like Roe v. Wade gave the American right a taste of what it is like to fear the judiciary, and they found that experience so painful that they spent decades devising reasons to constrain judicial power.\n\nScalia is, in many ways, a microcosm of the conservative movement as a whole, which has grown increasingly comfortable with aggressive judicial activism as the Supreme Court has moved to the right.\n\nNow, however, Roe is more than 40 years old and the Supreme Court has grown more and more conservative with each passing decade. Conservatives and Republicans no longer have much to fear from the judiciary. Indeed, outside the area of gay rights, the worst conservatives can expect from the Roberts Court is a decision which maintains the status quo instead of moving the law to the right. This means that conservatives and Republicans no longer have much motivation to seek out ways to prevent judges from reading their own preferences into the law.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m A Judicial Activist\u201d\n\nIndeed, asking judges to second-guess decisions made by the elected branches of government may now be the GOP\u2019s first line of defense against laws and executive actions they disapprove of \u2014 especially when those actions have President Obama\u2019s name on them. More than two dozen Republican officials signed onto NFIB v. Sebelius, the first Supreme Court case seeking to repeal Obamacare. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) described King v. Burwell, a more recent suit seeking to gut Obamacare, as an \u201copportunity presented to us by the Supreme Court\u201d to get \u201ca major do-over of the whole thing\u201d on health reform. When President Obama announced a new immigration policy that most Republicans disapprove of, they quickly found a Republican judge with a history of opinions calling for harsher treatment of immigrants who was willing to block the new policy. Just about the only thing President Obama\u2019s managed to accomplish without being sued for it is pardoning a Thanksgiving turkey.\n\nAmong the GOP\u2019s likely presidential candidates, no one has more wholeheartedly embraced this shift towards legislation-by-judiciary than Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY). \u201cI\u2019m a judicial activist,\u201d Paul proudly announced at at event sponsored by the conservative Heritage Foundation last January, before launching into a defense of the Supreme Court\u2019s 1905 decision in Lochner v. New York.\n\nLochner, which struck down a New York law prohibiting bakeries from overworking their bakers, has historically been held up by liberals and conservatives alike as symbolic of an entire era of judicial overreach. Indeed, the period in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century when the Court barred minimum wages laws, stripped workers of their right to organize and condemned countless young Americans to spend their childhoods working in coal mines, cotton mills and other factories is commonly referred to as the \u201cLochner Era.\u201d\n\nJust about the only thing President Obama\u2019s managed to accomplish without being sued for it is pardoning a Thanksgiving turkey.\n\nPaul has been as explicit as he can possibly be that he wants to bring back this era, and there should be little doubt that he would appoint justices who share the same values if given the chance. Meanwhile, though the GOP\u2019s other candidates have not spoken as openly about a desire to restore the kind of judicial activism that defined the Lochner Era, they are likely to seek counsel on judicial nominations from a segment of the bar that shared values very similar to Paul\u2019s.\n\nThe Incubator\n\nThe conservative Federalist Society is arguably the most powerful legal organization in the country. The keynote at its annual black tie dinner rotates among Justices Scalia, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito. Senators and other members of Congress typically fill up much of the audience at this annual event. Federalist Society Executive Vice President Leonard Leo shaped much of the second President Bush\u2019s judicial nominations strategy, and many of Bush\u2019s most high-profile appointments to the bench were themselves members of the Society.\n\nMore than just a group that convenes conservative attorneys, the Federalist Society is an incubator for lawsuits such as NFIB and King, and its meetings offer a window into the concerns that animate the kinds of lawyers who would be candidates for a judicial appointment in a Republican administration.\n\nOnce upon a time, when calls for judicial restraint were ascendant on the right, the Federalist Society was also an incubator for this more restrained vision. In 2006, for example, federal-judge-turned-cabinet-secretary Michael Chertoff claimed that \u201cin large part because of the work that the Society and others have done, the claim for judicial modesty is sufficiently well-established that everybody understands, even the critics of that claim, that they have to take it seriously and they have to address it.\u201d President Bush made his comparison between judicial activism and \u201cjudicial lawlessness\u201d at a Federalist Society conference one year later.\n\nLast fall\u2019s convening of the Federalist Society\u2019s annual lawyer\u2019s convention, by contrast, featured one panel questioning the wisdom of anti-discrimination laws \u2014 panelist Gail Heriot, a professor at University of San Diego School of Law, claimed that America needs to \u201ctake a hard look at some of the ways in which\u201d anti-discrimination laws \u201chave backfired, doing no good or more harm than good\u201d \u2014 and another panel questioning the wisdom of the minimum wage.\n\nThese concerns are likely to influence \u2014 and may even drive the decision-making of \u2014 the next Republican who has the opportunity to name federal judges. Should that president wish to return to an era where the minimum wage and bans on private discrimination were considered unconstitutional, they will already have at least one powerful ally in this fight. Justice Clarence Thomas has, in multiple opinions, embraced a narrow reading of the federal government\u2019s constitutional powers which would forbid child labor laws, minimum wage laws, and the ban on whites-only lunch counters.\n\nOn the day that the next president takes office, Justice Breyer will be 78 years-old \u2014 and he will only be the fourth oldest member of the Court if no other justice departs before that date. Should these four justices be replaced with judges who think like Justice Thomas, that will mean that the Court will have enough votes to repeal much of the twentieth century.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Four justices are over the age of 76.
