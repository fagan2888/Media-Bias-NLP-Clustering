Going further, he told the crowd that he it's not enough simply to put good people in charge.\n\n\"What is the one thing the federal government has to do? It has to keep us safe. That is the job of the federal government. That is it's number one obligation and being president \u2014 your most important job is to be the commander and chief of the United States,\" Rubio said. \"We cannot have a commander in chief that is not ready the first day in office, because Vladimir Putin is not going to wait for the next president to catch up. ISIS is not going to slow down ... there is no honeymoon period in foreign policy.\"\n\n\"You can't just say the way some people in this race have said \u2014 you'll probably know what I'm talking about in a moment. You can't just [say] 'When I get there, I'll hire the smartest people and they'll tell me what to do,'\" Rubio said pointedly at Trump. \"There's a reason why we have civilian control of the military in this country. There's a reason why the smartest people are already there. They're already telling the president what we should be doing \u2014 he's ignoring it. You deserve to know exactly what the next commander in chief is going to do.\"\n\nToward the end of the rally before nearly 1,300, Rubio then took Trump on for recently saying that he would remain \"neutral\" in negotiations between Israel and Palestine. Trump told MSNBC's Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski last Thursday that he would be a \"neutral guy\" in negotiations between the sides.\n\n\"Again, the front-runner in this race, Donald Trump, has said he's not going to take sides on Israel vs. the Palestinians because he wants to be an honest broker,\" Rubio railed. \"Well there's no such thing as an honest broker in that because the Palestinian Authority, which has strong links to terror, teach little kids \u2014 five-year-olds \u2014 that it's a glorious thing to kill Jews.\"\n\n\"They turn down deal after deal after deal. They don't want a deal,\" Rubio said. \"They've already said we want to destroy Israel ... We will not be an impartial advocate when it comes to the issue of Israel. When I'm president, we're going to take sides. We are going to be on Israel's side.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "In a preview of Thursday's debate, Sen.
