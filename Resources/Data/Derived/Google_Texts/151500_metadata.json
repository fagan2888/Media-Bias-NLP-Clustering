That list includes senior Megan Kalda.\n\n\"We're graduating at the end of the month and almost all of us have jobs,\" Kalda said. \"I will be working at Sanford. I'm excited about that.\"\n\nThe nursing program is growing with the field. A new $35 million renovation of the Gilbert Science Center will be complete in 2016.\n\n\"This is a new beginning for Augustana. We're so excited,\" Schroeder said.\n\nIt will change the way Augie teaches nursing students for the better.\n\nIf there is one downside, WalletHub says South Dakota ranks 46th for annual average salary for nurses. It's not something Kalda is worried about.\n\n\"It's not all about pay. I mean that definitely is a huge part of it because you have to make a living. Nursing is more than pay. It's about the job. It's about what you're doing. I'm ok with that,\" Kalda said.\n\nSouth Dakota ranks third for educational opportunities and fourth for number of health care facilities per capita. Augustana is currently seeing 100 percent placement for nursing students.\n\nEducation\n\nCollege {{Title}} Remove Change News General Courts Web Only Crime Outdoors Events Center Non-Homepage Boredom Busters Pipeline Positively KELOLAND Technology Hunger Affordable Care Act Shops Flooding Remembering 9/11 Drought JazzFest Spring Storm Honor Flight Spencer Anniversary\n\nDoApp Health News Business News Sports\n\nAgriculture Markets Livestock Crops Politics\n\nHealthBeat Cancer Children's Health Heart Health Wellness & Nutrition General Health Beat Women's Health RX Resources What's Going Around OTC Diabetes Recalls Dental Health Men's Health\n\nPolitics South Dakota Legislature Budget Congress Taxes General Local Campaign President US Senate New Laws US House Iowa Ballot Issues Local Races Minnesota Gubernatorial\n\nEducation Funding College Elementary High School Pre K School Supplies Middle School\n\nSports Professional College High School Sports Zone Headlines Summit League Tournament Olympics\n\nBusiness Industry Your Money Matters Development Gas & Energy Legislation Economy/Stocks Employment General Health Care Technology Education Funding Tourism Banking/Finance Housing Transportation Insurance Meetings & Events Retail & Restaurants All Industries On The Move Shops Agriculture\n\nFeatured Stories Eye on KELOLAND Inside KELOLAND\n\nWeather Snow Forecast Records Rain Flooding Drought WX Corner General\n\nWorld News\n\nInvestigates GEAR UP\n\nSponsored Done\n\n\u00a9 2016 KELOLAND TV.
