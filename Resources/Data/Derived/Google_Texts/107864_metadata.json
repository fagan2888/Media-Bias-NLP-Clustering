The numbers were made public yesterday, in a blog post written by Global Head of Diversity Maxine Williams. The company is mostly male, white and Asian.\n\nThis public disclosure, of both gender and diversity statistics, follows the trend of other large tech companies, spurred by a late May release from Google. Since Google made its numbers public Chegg, LinkedIn and Yahoo have also released their workforce breakdown.\n\nSadly, Facebook\u2019s numbers look a lot like the other four. I\u2019ll let the figures speak for themselves:\n\nGlobally the company is 69 percent male, 31 percent female. In terms of ethnicity the company is 57 percent white, 34 percent Asian, 4 percent Hispanic, 3 percent two or more races, 3 percent black and 0 percent other.\n\nScrutinized further, in the tech force of Facebook, 85 percent are male and 15 percent are female. In terms of ethnicity in the tech division 53 percent are white, 41 percent are Asian, 3 percent are Hispanic, 2 percent are two or more races, 1 percent is black and 0 percent is other.\n\nGlobally, leadership is 77 percent male, and 23 percent female. Facebook\u2019s leadership in the U.S. is also mostly white \u2014 74 percent. Leadership at the company is 19 percent Asian, 4 percent Hispanic, 2 percent black and 1 percent two or more races.\n\nThe non-tech workforce is 53 percent male, 47 percent female, 63 percent white, 24 percent Asian, 6 percent Hispanic, 4 percent two or more races, 2 percent black and 1 percent other.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The verdict?
