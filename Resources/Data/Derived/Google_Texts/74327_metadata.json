The final tally from the event was unclear, but a source knowledgeable of Curry\u2019s fundraising operations said the campaign received a pledge of $250,000 before the event began.\n\nMayor Alvin Brown, a graduate of the university, spoke briefly before Romney but avoided much of his campaign rhetoric.\n\nHe told the students he hoped they would remain in Jacksonville as they embark on their careers.\n\n\u201cBecause Jacksonville is truly the best place in America,\u201d he said.\n\nIn all, about 540 students walked across the stage Saturday, and nearly 900 graduated, in total, according to the university.\n\nIn addition the keynote speech, Romney received an honorary doctorate degree, bestowed upon him by University President Tim Cost.\n\nDuring the 20-minute speech, peppered with Bible verses from the books of Genesis and Psalms, Romney didn\u2019t spend much time waxing politics.\n\nHowever, he briefly criticized Washington for being \u201cinept, powerless and without an effective strategy\u201d to face the country\u2019s biggest challenges.\n\n\u201cAmerica needs your passion, your impatience, your participation in the political discourse. Engaging in your world includes engaging in citizenship,\u201d he saidl\n\nHe implored students to get involved this election season.\n\n\u201cFor the sake of preserving freedom, vote,\u201d he said. \u201cPlease vote.\u201d\n\nRhema Thompson: (904) 359-4693", "article_metadata": {"description": "Expand and engage at every opportunity, even when it leads to failure.That\u2019s the advice former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney imparted on about 500 students seated on the Jacksonville University green Saturday.\u201cWith 16 years of education, the world you know has been greatly expanded...,\u201d he said. \u201cKeep expanding your world.
