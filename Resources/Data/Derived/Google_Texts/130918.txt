It's no secret that the young and the healthy are key to the success and cost-effectiveness of the Affordable Care Act. But according to a recent poll conducted by Harvard University's Institute of Politics, millenials just aren't into Obamacare and 58 percent of the 18-29-year-olds surveyed said they disapprove of the law.

A national organization called Get Covered is hoping to change young Americans' minds so they'll "Sign Up 'Cause It's Hot" by reaching out to them in language they can appreciate.

The group partnered with Covered California to launch a parody rap of the Snoop Dogg hit "Drop It Like It's Hot," featuring Obama impersonator Iman Crosson, to promote the law's provisions and direct them to the health care exchanges.

Here's a sampling of the lyrics:

“When I’m in the Oval Office call me President Barack, President Barack, President Barack / When my critics get an attitude, I tell ‘em to stop, I tell ‘em to stop, I tell ‘em to stop / And if you need that new health care, sign up ’cause it’s hot, sign up ’cause it’s hot, sign up ’cause it’s hot.”

“So don’t stand and diddle, my health care’s the ‘shizzle’ / It’s chock full of top notch health care ‘provizzles’ / We’ll cover all you’re ‘vizzles,’ your ‘dizzles’ AND your ‘tizzles’ / Now while you figure that out, it’s back to that ‘chorizzle’.”

The video is part of a larger social media campaign to get millennials covered that has featured celebrities like Jennifer Hudson, Lady Gaga and Tatyana Ali.

"One of the key reasons we're doing this campaign is that those under 30 live and breathe social media – they live Twitter, they live Facebook," Peter Lee, executive director of Covered California, told the Los Angeles Times. "Young people are not young and invincible, rather they're the young convincibles."
