And those women are all from the more established Biennale participants in the Giardini, around one-third of the 89 national pavilions.\n\nThe prominence of women in the national pavilions \u2014 which along with the main show curated by Okwui Enwezor comprise the 56th International Art Exhibition \u2014 may be coincidence. Still, the force of the female numbers is gaining notice as somehow tapping into a zeitgeist and challenging the notion of the art world as being male dominated.\n\n\u201cI think it is wonderful so many women are representing countries this year. I think it is great,\u201d Jonas said, sitting outside the U.S. pavilion \u2014 where she had just been approached by a woman who thanked her for giving hope to female artists.\n\nJonas started her artistic career as a sculptor in the 1960s before moving into performance art and becoming an early adapter to video in the 1970s. She said that her participation in the Biennale would bring \u201ca lot more attention to my work\u201d \u2014 while adding that she always felt supported.\n\n\u201cI am an artist\u2019s artist. From the very beginning, I had an audience. From the very beginning, I felt appreciated,\u201d she said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t continue to work like this if I didn\u2019t have the support of my fellow artists, and then many curators, over the years.\u201d\n\nHer show, titled \u201cThey Come to Us Without a Word,\u201d comprises four galleries with thematic compositions of video installations, prints and objects that explore natural phenomena taking inspiration from passages by Icelandic writer Halldor Laxness. The pavilion\u2019s central rotunda provides the theater for a fifth gallery, a study of light and reflection featuring Murano-made mirrors and a crystal chandelier.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Venice Biennale represents rebalancing in the art world", "title": "Venice Biennale represents rebalancing in the art world", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Venice Biennale represents rebalancing in the art world", "title": "Venice Biennale represents rebalancing in the art world", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/05/09/venice_biennale_represents_rebalancing_in_the_art_world/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/italy-biennale-of-arts.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Venice Biennale represents rebalancing in the art world", "title": "Venice Biennale represents rebalancing in the art world", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/italy-biennale-of-arts.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Colleen Barry", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "And those women are all from the more established Biennale participants in the Giardini, around one-third of the 89 national pavilions.\nTopics: From the Wires, NewsVENICE (AP) \u2014 A Nigerian art critic and museum director is the first African to curate the Biennale contemporary art fair that opens Saturday for its seven-month run, while female artists are representing more countries than ever in national pavilions \u2014 trends seen as an informal rebalancing in the art world.\nThe prominence of women in the national pavilions \u2014 which along with the main show curated by Okwui Enwezor comprise the 56th International Art Exhibition \u2014 may be coincidence.\nStill, the force of the female numbers is gaining notice as somehow tapping into a zeitgeist and challenging the notion of the art world as being male dominated.\nShe said that her participation in the Biennale would bring \u201ca lot more attention to my work\u201d \u2014 while adding that she always felt supported."}
