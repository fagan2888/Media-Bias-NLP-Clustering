Drawing doctors to rural and nonmetropolitan areas is one of the biggest challenges for the impending shortage, as FierceHealthcare has reported.\n\nDall said the study is not a formal recommendation. \"The question is, how can we best optimize things so that we have the right number, the right specialty mix of physicians, and that we can attract them and retain them in the state of Florida,\" Dall said.\n\nThe nation will be short by 91,000 doctors by 2020, according to some estimates, although many of the studies predicting physician shortages have proven inaccurate and overblown, FierceHealthcare previously reported. Retiring baby boomers, an aging population and the arrival of the Affordable Care Act have all been cited as instigators in the shortage, potentially leading to a national crisis. Some, however, see market-specific shortages as a far more likely threat.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- check out the study\n\n- read the Health News Florida article\n\nRelated Article:\n\nPhysician shortage to hit hospital bottom lines\n\nBattle to find docs may be a regional--not national--problem\n\nStates expand programs to draw doctors to rural areas\n\nReport: Florida has worst physician shortage\n\nIs the coming physician shortage a myth?", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Florida physician shortage will escalate drastically over the next 10 years, according to a new study commissioned by the Teaching Hospital Council of Florida and the Safety Net Hospital Alliance of Florida.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "The Florida physician shortage will escalate drastically over the next 10 years, according to a new study commissioned by the Teaching Hospital Council of Florida and the Safety Net Hospital Alliance of Florida.", "title": "Florida will fall 7,000 doctors short in the next decade", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/florida-will-fall-7000-doctors-short-next-decade/2015-02-17", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Doctor Shortage,Florida,HR & Workforce Management,medical schools,Operations & Business Management,safety net hospital alliance of florida,teaching hospital council of florida", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "HR & Workforce Management,Operations & Business Management"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2b15\"", "article_summary": "The Florida physician shortage will escalate drastically over the next 10 years, according to a new study commissioned by the Teaching Hospital Council of Florida and the Safety Net Hospital Alliance of Florida.\nIf current trends continue, the state, already facing the worst of the physician shortage, will be some 7,000 doctors short, according to Tim Dall, author of the study and managing director of IHS Global.\nTim Goldfarb, an executive vice president at UF Health Shands, said medical schools and lawmakers need to address the problem, according to Health News Florida.\nDrawing doctors to rural and nonmetropolitan areas is one of the biggest challenges for the impending shortage, as FierceHealthcare has reported.\n\"Over the foreseeable future, the ability of Florida to provide at least a national average level of care is about 7- to 10- percent below the national average,\" he told Health News Florida."}
