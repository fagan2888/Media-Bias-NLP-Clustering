Burwell \u2014 such as the Little Sisters of the Poor \u2014 as \u201cout of touch bosses\u201d who are suing the government to merely avoid paperwork.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in the consolidated Zubik case, which includes Little Sisters of the Poor Home for the Aged v. Burwell. Thirty-seven petitioners have asked the Court to exempt them from the Affordable Care Act\u2019s Health and Human Services mandate that requires them to cover contraceptive and abortifacient drugs in their employee health insurance plans, because they believe providing such drugs or facilitating their dispersal would violate their conscience.\n\nIn a series of tweets regarding the case, but without explicitly naming the Little Sisters of the Poor, Planned Parenthood lashed out at \u201cout-of-touch bosses\u201d who are \u201csuing to get out of basic paperwork.\u201d They also criticized the notion that the case is about religious freedom.\n\n\u201cJust when we thought the nation\u2019s largest abortion provider couldn\u2019t sink any lower, they proved us wrong by picking a fight with the Little Sisters of the Poor,\u201d Rep. Diane Black (R-Tenn.), told TheBlaze.\n\nWe \u2764\ufe0e our no-copay birth control coverage & WON'T let out-of-touch bosses take it away! #HandsOffMyBC #ZubikvBurwell pic.twitter.com/Ld1PpgRaev \u2014 Planned Parenthood (@PPact) March 23, 2016\n\nBirth control has been nothing short of revolutionary but we're still fighting to ensure that everyone has access. pic.twitter.com/udHRSC6bUd \u2014 Planned Parenthood (@PPact) March 23, 2016\n\n\u201cThis continues a disturbing trend on the part of Planned Parenthood,\u201d Black said. \u201cFrom fantasizing about \u2018free and plentiful\u2019 abortion, to lashing out at Catholic nuns who care for the elderly poor, the true, dark nature of this abortion giant is being revealed over time.\u201d\n\n#ZubikvBurwell is not about religious freedom. It is about restricting access to birth control. #HandsOffMyBC pic.twitter.com/5FUmf5s77j \u2014 Planned Parenthood (@PPact) March 23, 2016\n\nMYTH: #ZubikvBurwell is just about a small group of nuns. FACT: It would have a huge impact\u2192https://t.co/hJkNqMHAXq pic.twitter.com/Jj2O2vyzoG \u2014 Planned Parenthood (@PPact) March 23, 2016\n\nThe government and supporters of the mandate have argued that the groups have been offered an \u201caccommodation\u201d in which they notify their insurers of their objections to the drugs, who will provide contraceptive services to patients, but opponents and the petitioners liken the accommodation to signing a permission slip for things they don\u2019t condone.\n\n\u201cReligious employers\u201d were exempt from the mandate, but \u201cother non-profit religious organizations\u201d were not.\n\nYour medical decisions are just that \u2014 your own. But some bosses want to chip away at #BC coverage. #HandsOffMyBC pic.twitter.com/4uEaJ0zFFr \u2014 Planned Parenthood (@PPact) March 23, 2016\n\n\u201cThe Little Sisters of the Poor are servants of their faith who are rightfully standing up for their First Amendment guarantee of religious freedom,\u201d Black added. \u201cUltimately, I believe that Planned Parenthood\u2019s foolish decision to go after such a laudable organization will help further the Little Sisters\u2019 cause, because it sets up a stark contrast between the compassion of life-giving ministries such as theirs and the callousness of the big abortion industry.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for Planned Parenthood did not immediately return TheBlaze\u2019s request for comment.\n\n\u2014\n\nFollow Kate Scanlon (@kgscanlon) on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "gplus-count": 1, "twitter": {"description": "A conservative female lawmaker is firing back at Planned Parenthood for their characterization of the petitioners in Zubik v.
