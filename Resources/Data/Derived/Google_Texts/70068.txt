Storms wash out road and some residents can't get anywhere.

The recent storms have washed out roads all over the state. One of those in Cleveland County is making it impossible for some people to get anywhere.

Carolyn Drive is a half-mile long stretch of gravel road, a quarter-mile east of 149th Street and Harrah Newalla Road. Residents along Carolyn Road told News 9 the road washed away last week, and with every rain it's getting worse.

They said nine families live along Carolyn Drive, which they said has been in existence for two decades. Those residents, they said, include three people who are disabled, and three newborn babies.

Okey McCarty said his wife is disabled, and they live at the end of the road. “We called the county, and the county said it's not a county road, so they won't help us at all. I've called the governor's office, I've called my representative, I've called a senator.”

"What do they say?" We asked.

“Nobody, nobody will help us. It's a private road. It's a private road.”

McCarty estimated it will cost at least $100,000 to fix the road. Further complicating the situation, McCarty and other residents told News 9 the road technically sits in the Oklahoma City limits.
