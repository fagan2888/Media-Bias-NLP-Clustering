Applicants must enroll by Dec. 15 in order to receive health plans that take effect at the beginning of 2014.\n\nBased on public reports, Wu said it appears that many of the glitches are the result of problems in how different government systems interact with each other. Those problems will be more difficult to identify and fix than simple errors in code or a shortage of server capacity, he said.\n\n\u201cIt's definitely past the point where it's a superficial problem,\u201d Wu said.\n\nBut Aneesh Chopra, the former White House chief technology officer, said he is confident the administration will be able to iron out the technical problems.\n\n\u201cMy hope is that we\u2019ll see progress every day, and we\u2019ll look back on this period as an unfortunate footnote on the story of the Affordable Care Act,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Obama administration appears to recognize the danger the website\u2019s problems mean for ObamaCare, and the challenge confronting them.\n\nPresident Obama this week promised a \u201ctech surge\u201d of additional experts who will work to fix the site. He appointed former Office of Management and Budget Director Jeff Zients to lead the effort.\n\nZients emphasized Friday that the website does not need to be scrapped and said his team is working off an initial \u201cpunch list\u201d that includes more than two dozen must-do repairs.\n\nOne high priority is fixing part of the system that is sending error-ridden application data to health insurers, Zients said, as well as improving the basic user experience.\n\nAs part of the triage effort, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) announced that it has hired one of the companies behind HealthCare.gov as a contractor for the repairs.\n\nThat company, QSSI, was the one that built the site's account registration tool and its data hub. Officials admit the registration tool has been plagued by problems but say the data hub has been running smoothly.\n\nThe data hub\u2019s main purpose is to help verify people\u2019s personal information when they apply for health insurance via the new online insurance marketplaces. The data hub will verify an applicant's identity by checking the information they entered into the insurance marketplace with records from federal agency databases.\n\nFor example, the data hub may check whether an applicant is in the country illegally or eligible for a tax subsidy.\n\n\u201cThe fact that that [data hub] system appears to be working, or at least working reasonably well based on the publicly reported feedback, gives me greater comfort that the challenges are fixable and mostly associated with the marketplace,\u201d Chopra said.\n\nBut Wu said that even though the transmission of information through the data hub seems to be working, the system is still struggling to verify eligibility.\n\n\u201cThe two systems that it connects\u2014do they process the information that's being sent correctly? And that seems to be an issue,\u201d Wu said.\n\nHe also questioned how useful the \u201csurge\u201d of additional information technology experts will be. He noted that any new programmers will have to be brought up to speed on the existing code.\n\n\u201cYou can't throw a hundred surgeons into a room and expect it to take one one-hundredth of the time,\u201d Wu said.\n\nClay Johnson, a former Presidential Innovation Fellow and the CEO of the Department of Better Technology, said the problems with HealthCare.gov stem from the way the government hires outside contractors.\n\nHe said the process, which involves lengthy forms and technical language, rewards firms with the best lawyers, rather than the firms with the best programmers.\n\nHe also noted that a host of regulations make it more difficult to build a government website than a private one. For example, regulations require that all government websites be accessible to the blind and meet a host of security requirements.\n\n\u201cAll of the regulations are well-intended,\u201d he said, but he argued the regulations and contract system lead many projects to come in late, over-budget and full of technical problems.\n\nFranklin Reeder, the former chief of information policy at the Office of Management and Budget, said it is \u201chard to understand\u201d how the software wasn't tested better and the problems weren't identified sooner.\n\n\u201cThat said, the important thing at this point is to focus first on fixing the problems and then, in a more dispassionate way, to look at causes and lessons learned,\u201d Reeder said in an email. \u201cMy worry is that, in the current political climate, we will do exactly the opposite and engage in a witch hunt.\u201d\n\nElise Viebeck contributed.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "One expert says fixing a site once it's online is like repairing a car going 50 miles per hour.", "description": "One expert says fixing a site once it's online is like repairing a car going 50 miles per hour.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Brendan Sasso and Jennifer Martinez", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "One expert says fixing a site once it's online is like repairing a car going 50 miles per hour.", "title": "White House faces tall order in fixing ObamaCare site", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/188127-white-house-faces-tall-order-fixing-obamacare-site", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/blogs/obamacare_10252013getty_1.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T04:40:00-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T04:40-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/188127-white-house-faces-tall-order-fixing-obamacare-site", "dcterms.date": "2013-10-26T07:26-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Rachel Huggins", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",,", "article": {"published_time": "2013-10-26T07:26:56-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T04:40:00-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/188127-white-house-faces-tall-order-fixing-obamacare-site", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "One expert says fixing a site once it's online is like repairing a car going 50 miles per hour.", "card": "summary", "title": "White House faces tall order in fixing ObamaCare site"}, "dcterms.title": "White House faces tall order in fixing ObamaCare site"}, "article_summary": "For example, the data hub may check whether an applicant is in the country illegally or eligible for a tax subsidy.\nThat company, QSSI, was the one that built the site's account registration tool and its data hub.\nOfficials admit the registration tool has been plagued by problems but say the data hub has been running smoothly.\nApplicants must enroll by Dec. 15 in order to receive health plans that take effect at the beginning of 2014.\nTech experts say the Obama administration faces a daunting challenge in trying to fix the troubled ObamaCare enrollment website by the end of November."}
