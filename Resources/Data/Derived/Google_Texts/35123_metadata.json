It took place on Tuesday, but a breakdown in the telephone system prevented the incident being made public earlier.\n\nThe two female suicide bombers sneaked into an internally displaced persons (IDP) camp and detonated themselves in the middle of it, emergency officials and the military source said.\n\nThe chairman of the State Emergency Management Agency, Satomi Ahmad, added that 78 people were injured.\n\nNo group claimed responsibility but the attack bore the hallmarks of Boko Haram, which has frequently used female bombers and even children to hit targets.\n\nThe militant group has recently increased the frequency and deadliness of attacks with three at the end of January. At least 65 people were killed outside Borno state capital Maiduguri on Jan. 31.\n\nSince it lost territory to a government counter-offensive last year, Boko Haram has reverted to hit-and-run attacks on villages and suicide bombings at places of worship or markets.\n\nBoko Haram has only rarely targeted camps housing people displaced by the conflict and Tuesday's attack was the first one to kill victims in Borno state.\n\nThe military said militants made one abortive attempt on a camp on the outskirts of Maiduguri on Jan. 31. Boko Haram hit a Nigerian IDP camp for the first time last September, in the Adamawa state capital of Yola.\n\n(Reporting by Lanre Ola; Writing by Ulf Laessing; Editing by Mark Heinrich)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/02/10/More-60-people-killed-suicide-bombs-Nigeria-officials", "type": "article", "site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The attack occurred 85 km (50 miles) outside the capital of Borno state, centre of the", "title": "Female suicide bombers kill over 60 people in northeast Nigeria: officials"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/02/10/More-60-people-killed-suicide-bombs-Nigeria-officials", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The attack occurred 85 km (50 miles) outside the capital of Borno state, centre of the", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "At least 65 people were killed outside Borno state capital Maiduguri on Jan. 31.\nBoko Haram hit a Nigerian IDP camp for the first time last September, in the Adamawa state capital of Yola.\nNo group claimed responsibility but the attack bore the hallmarks of Boko Haram, which has frequently used female bombers and even children to hit targets.\nThe attack occurred 85 km (50 miles) outside the capital of Borno state, centre of the seven-year insurgency, they said.\nBoko Haram has only rarely targeted camps housing people displaced by the conflict and Tuesday's attack was the first one to kill victims in Borno state."}
