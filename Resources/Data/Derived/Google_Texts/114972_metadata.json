A judge gave him two options: Seek care for his drinking problem, or go to jail.\n\nToday, 28 years later, Botticelli is not only sober, but helping to shape a dramatic new approach to how the United States confronts drug and alcohol abuse. As the first former addict to run the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, he has a different perspective from any of his six predecessors.\n\nFor nearly three decades, the war on drugs meant that low-level, nonviolent drug offenders would receive stiff mandatory minimum sentences. While that drove the prison population to record levels, critics say it did little to solve the problem of addiction.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve come to understand that our largely punitive responses to people with substance abuse disorders is ineffective,\u201d says Botticelli. \u201cIt\u2019s inhumane. And it\u2019s costly.\u201d\n\nAs the nation\u2019s drug czar, Botticelli says substance abuse needs to be treated as a public health issue. \u201cLaw enforcement has a role to play,\u201d he says, \u201cbut our efforts need to be focused on increasing prevention, treatment, supporting people in recovery.\u201d\n\nIn the below interview with FRONTLINE\u2019s Martin Smith, Botticelli talks about his own struggles with addiction, the nation\u2019s heroin and opioid epidemic, and why he says \u201cwe can\u2019t arrest our way out of our problem.\u201d\n\nThis is an edited transcript of an interview conducted on Sept. 16, 2015.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about the moment we\u2019re in here. You are a public health professional. You\u2019ve come into this job after a long line of generals and police chiefs, and here we are in a moment in which we\u2019re rethinking how it is that we\u2019re going to think about drug abuse, drug addiction, all of these things. Why now?\n\nI think my nomination and my confirmation and my background and personal history around these issues are really emblematic of a growing consensus of where we are in drug policy, not just in the United States but around the world. \u2026\n\nI think the basis for that is really rooted in a number of different things. One, our scientific understanding of addiction has just grown tremendously. \u2026 We know that this is a disease like any other chronic disease, that it has genetic components to it and environmental factors to it.\n\nI think also we\u2019ve come to really understand that our largely punitive responses to people with substance use disorders is ineffective. It\u2019s inhumane, and it\u2019s costly. And what I think is really important to note is that this consensus is without a political battlefield, right? We see people from the far left and the far right coming to agreement that we can\u2019t continue to sustain our historic approach as to how we\u2019ve dealt with addiction and substance use.\n\nThere are racial questions in this, that we applied this sort of an incarceration model when the majority of drug users were black or brown. Once white people started doing these drugs, we started to talk about other models. Is that unfair?\n\nI think there was a growing consensus, particularly with this administration, that we needed to really deal with the historic racial and ethnic inequities in our prison system, and that\u2019s been largely focused on people of color who have been incarcerated, many of whom are there as low-level nonviolent offenders around drug-use issues. But I do think that there is a building conversation and recognition not just as it relates to people of color, but as it relates to people with substance use disorders in general that this has been an ineffective approach to what we\u2019re doing.\n\nYou were watching this from Boston, where you were working in public health and drug policy. But you were starting to see these shifts going on in Washington. Did you ever think you would be here?\n\nI didn\u2019t. Particularly as someone with a history of addiction, I didn\u2019t ever think that I would end up being the White House director of National Drug Control Policy. It was very startling to see the shift under President Obama and then-Director [Gil] Kerlikowske.\n\nI recall being on a telephone call when the administration released its 2010 inaugural strategy, and I heard things that I\u2019d never heard from federal drug policy, things like: we can\u2019t arrest our way out of our problem; that we have to deal with this as a public health-related issue; that law enforcement has a role to play but our efforts need to be focused on increasing prevention, treatment, supporting people in recovery. It was really startling for me to hear that kind of change coming from this office. I think the history of this office, while it\u2019s been evolving, was largely focused on law enforcement-centric approaches to dealing with the problem of substance use in the United States.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve come to really understand that our largely punitive responses to people with substance use disorders is ineffective. It\u2019s inhumane, and it\u2019s costly.\u201d\n\nStill the balance of your budget, not by a wide margin, but still most of the money is for interdiction and law enforcement.\n\nIf you look at our drug control budget writ large, you\u2019ll see that the biggest increases that our budget has taken have been on prevention, treatment and recovery support services. Spending on those public health approaches is now at its highest level that it has been within the administration.\n\nBut it\u2019s still less than interdiction and enforcement.\n\nWell, I\u2019ll say this: that when you look at supply reduction efforts, some of those areas are not just typically law enforcement approaches. They\u2019re about institution building with other countries. But I will also say, too, that I have seen a remarkable change, particularly with domestic law enforcement and their approach to how they\u2019re dealing at a community level with people with addictive disorders. So law enforcement, I think, understands that we need to have good prevention and treatment services.\n\nI\u2019ve seen law enforcement across this country understanding that we can\u2019t arrest our way out of the problem. When I hear that echoed back to me by local police chiefs and law enforcement folks, I know that we\u2019re continuing to make progress on understanding at a community level that arrest and incarceration are not appropriate for the vast majority of people who have substance use disorders.\n\nSo while we do still spend dollars on domestic law enforcement, I think it\u2019s important for our communities to not be riddled with substances in their communities. That\u2019s really important. But what I also see is tremendous partnerships happening between public health and public safety advocates really calling for a balanced, holistic solution to this problem.\n\n[Editor\u2019s Note: On Feb. 9, 2016, the White House announced that under the administration\u2019s 2017 budget, federal efforts to reduce the demand for drugs would for the first time be funded at similar levels as efforts to reduce the supply.]\n\n\u2026 You talked about getting on the phone and listening in on a call and hearing things that you were really floored that you were hearing. It was Kerlikowske who said, \u201cWe\u2019re no longer going to call this a war on drugs.\u201d What do you remember when you heard that?\n\nIf I remember him correctly, he said, \u201cA war on drugs is fundamentally a war on people.\u201d Framing it that way I think for me was a real eye-opening experience around how we\u2019re dealing with people.\n\nIt also promoted things like reversing overdoses by police and supporting things like syringe-access programs. \u2026 It really was for me a very, very clear signal from the Office of National Drug Control Policy that they were clearly pivoting away from a war-on-drugs approach to really how we think of a much more compassionate and humane response of dealing with drug use and its consequences.\n\nYou\u2019ve talked about your own personal history. Though you weren\u2019t primarily abusing an illegal drug \u2014 you were abusing alcohol \u2014 I\u2019m interested in how you reacted to, you know, \u201cLet\u2019s treat these people not as criminals; let\u2019s treat these people as people with problems.\u201d You must have related to that.\n\nMy personal experience significantly guides my work here, and clearly, I can look back on my own experience that, as a result of a drunk-driving accident, I was offered a choice by a judge who said, \u201cGet care and treatment, or we can continue to pursue prosecution as it relates to your drunk driving.\u201d So I had the opportunity at that point to get care and treatment, and was diverted away from the criminal justice system. That\u2019s what I want to see for everybody. \u2026\n\nI\u2019ll also say that my own trajectory really indicates how we need to regard this as a chronic disorder. I, like many people, started drinking from a very young age. I had a history of addiction in my family. Unfortunately, my drinking and my addiction was undiagnosed, unchecked by anyone within the medical system.\n\nWe know that we don\u2019t have to wait for people to progress to their most acute disorder or, unfortunately, wait until an intersection with the criminal justice system identifies people with a substance use disorder. Part of what we\u2019ve really been trying to do is reframe addiction as a chronic disorder that has components of early onset, so focusing on prevention, doing a better job at identifying people earlier in their disease progression, and getting people care and treatment before it develops into this acute disorder. I often say \u2014 and you\u2019ve often heard the expression that people have to hit bottom before we get care. That is ridiculous.\n\nWe don\u2019t say with any other disease, \u201cWe\u2019re going to wait till you reach your most acute stage before we decide to intervene.\u201d So if our understanding of addiction has changed, that it is a chronic disorder, we need to mirror other disorders in terms of their care, intervention and treatment.\n\nIs there any difference between the abuse of alcohol and any other drug? Does the analogy carry over, I mean, that they\u2019re all chronic diseases?\n\nThey\u2019re all chronic diseases, and there are very similar biologic and development components to addiction. So whether it\u2019s alcohol, marijuana or other drugs, there are similar issues and properties that all substances share as it relates to addiction.\n\nSomebody\u2019s going to be listening to you and they\u2019re going to say: \u201cWell, he was using alcohol. That\u2019s not what we\u2019re talking about here. We\u2019re talking about illegal drugs.\u201d So they don\u2019t necessarily immediately make the connection between you as an alcoholic and a drug addict using heroin, meth or crack cocaine.\n\nWell, you know, I think you had talked to Dr. Nora Volkow, who\u2019s the director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, and she\u2019ll tell you addiction is addiction is addiction. Just because my substance of choice happened to be alcohol, that doesn\u2019t mean that I can pick up or use another substance safely. \u2026\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve often heard the expression that people have to hit bottom before we get care. That is ridiculous. We don\u2019t say with any other disease, \u2018We\u2019re going to wait till you reach your most acute stage before we decide to intervene.'\u201d\n\nThe Affordable Care Act is signed in March of 2010. You said it was one of the most important things that we\u2019ve seen.\n\nYeah. Significant drug policy change in a generation.\n\nAnd tell me why.\n\nWe know that unfortunately only about 11 percent of people who have a diagnosable substance use disorder get care and treatment. When you look at the reasons why people don\u2019t get care and treatment, one of the biggest reasons is not having insurance coverage, or not having insurance coverage that appropriately treats addiction.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act does two remarkable things. One, it says that substance use disorder benefits are part of an essential benefit package under the Affordable Care Act. The second thing that it does, it says for insurers who offer coverage, they have to offer that coverage just the same that they would any other medical surgical condition. That is huge in the sense that if we know that insurance coverage is a significant obstacle for people seeking care, that the Affordable Care Act dramatically changes people\u2019s ability to access care and treatment.\n\nSomebody\u2019s going to say, \u201cWell, can we really afford that?\u201d And they\u2019re going to say: \u201cThese people have made a choice. This is not something that we should be rushing in to and providing them a health care benefit.\u201d\n\nWe actually can\u2019t afford not to do it. That untreated addiction has such an economic toll on our medical system, certainly on our criminal justice system \u2013 there have been numerous studies to show the economic return on investment by offering people care and treatment for their disorder.\n\nAnd I quite honestly think that that\u2019s one of the reasons why we are seeing broad-based support for not only care and treatment, but criminal justice reform. It costs us tens upon tens of thousands of dollars to incarcerate someone. We know that it\u2019s much more economical to give them care and treatment than it is to incarcerate them.\n\nCan you put any numbers to that?\n\nMost of the studies that I have seen have shown for every dollar that you invest in treatment, you save about $7. Those benefits usually are in medical expenses and criminal justice expenses. \u2026\n\nDo we have enough treatment spots to provide everybody that has an addiction problem with adequate treatment?\n\nAs I\u2019ve traveled the country, and I think particularly now in the midst of this opiate epidemic, we know that we need to do a better job of expanding treatment access. That\u2019s why this administration continues to fund treatment services and resources for state and local treatment programs.\n\n[Health and Human Services] Secretary [Sylvia Mathews] Burwell just announced $100 million in new funding going to community health centers, which are often a place where newly insured people get care and coverage. So we continue to support treatment and treatment access, and will continue to support increased resources to ensure that people have adequate access to care and treatment.\n\nWe want to get to a point where we have treatment on demand, just like we do with other conditions, that when people are identified or when people step forward to need care, that we have a place for them in a good, high-quality treatment program.\n\nThat includes medically assisted treatment.\n\nThat includes medically assisted treatment.\n\nLike methadone.\n\nLike methadone, like buprenorphine, like Vivitrol. Like any good evidence-based program.\n\nPeople don\u2019t want those kinds of clinics in their neighborhoods.\n\nIt\u2019s really unfortunate that many communities, despite the fact that they often have, and are quite honestly subjected to the consequence of untreated addiction in their community through violence and crime, often don\u2019t want those kinds of treatment programs in their communities.\n\nI think it\u2019s really based on a misperception that this is someone else\u2019s problem, this is not a problem in my family or my community, and that it\u2019s going to be a magnet for crime and for addiction when all of the evidence points to the exact opposite.\n\n\u2026 The epidemic of prescription drug use in the United States and the increased heroin use in many parts of the country is really changing that conversation, and communities are coming to understand that they do need good community-based treatment programs and that they know that it\u2019s having an effect on their communities.\n\n\u2026 I want to talk about this problem of prescription drug use leading to heroin. How did we get to the mess we\u2019re in?\n\nHaving spent a lot of time in this work, the prescription drug epidemic really came from a different set of circumstances, right, so not a cartel coming into our town selling prescription medications. \u2026 It was about, I think, a gross misunderstanding in the medical community, often driven by the pharmaceutical industry, on underestimating the addiction properties of these drugs.\n\nThese were legally prescribed substances, right? So we know that people think when you\u2019re getting these prescriptions that they\u2019re safe, that they\u2019re beneficial. We know in this country that we had a significant problem in terms of undertreatment of pain, but we also had a significant misunderstanding about the addiction potential for these drugs, that we gave them in such vast quantities that it generated a significant amount of addiction.\n\nSo here\u2019s a bottle.\n\nHere\u2019s a bottle.\n\nTake four of these a day for a week.\n\nAnd I would even say beyond week \u2014 sometimes for months, sometimes for years. And [we] really did not adequately understand the addiction potential of these drugs. So this came at us in a different way. It was an epidemic that was driven by the vast overprescribing of prescription pain medication in the United States.\n\nIsn\u2019t there a profit motive here? How is it that a company could push these drugs as aggressively as they did? And how is it that the doctors didn\u2019t know the addictive properties?\n\nIf you look back at the history, the basis for the marketing of these substances and the scientific understanding was based, quite honestly, not on very good research that showed the addiction potential for these medications.\n\n\u2026 No one\u2019s arguing that we don\u2019t need to adequately treat pain in the United States, but our understanding and monitoring of people who are on these medications, who went on to develop significant prescription drug disorders, has been startling and shocking.\n\nSo when you look back at the genesis and the development of prescription drug misuses in the United States, you can track that. It correlates identically to the amount of overprescribing that\u2019s been happening here in the United States. A recent survey by the Centers for Disease Control shows that in 2012, we were prescribing enough pain medication to give every adult American 75 pain pills. Again, we want to make sure that pain is adequately treated, but we just don\u2019t have that much pain in the United States.\n\nYou know, I have my own personal story, as many people do, around being prescribed these medications when a medical practitioner knew I had a history of substance use disorders. \u2026 We know that medical practitioners get very little training in their residency programs and beyond around addiction in general and in particular around safe and effective opioid prescribing.\n\n\u2026 Talk about how we got from overprescription of pain relievers to a heroin epidemic.\n\nSure. So prescription drugs and heroin are very similar in many components in terms of they are both opioids, and they act in very similar ways in the brain. What we\u2019ve seen is that about 5 percent, so not the vast majority but about 5 percent of people who misuse prescription pain medication begin using heroin.\n\nBut if you look at newer users to heroin, four-fifths of them, about 80 percent, started using opioids by misusing prescription pain medication. We\u2019re really trying to unravel the exact circumstances of why people transition. One we know is an economic standpoint, that as people progress in their misuse of pain medication, buying those medications on the street is often much more expensive than heroin is.\n\nWe know that heroin supply and purity really has led to that transition from prescription drug to heroin, and we know that addiction in general is a progressive disorder and that people often progress to much more impactful substances just as a function of their addiction.\n\nSo I think it\u2019s really important for us to think about how do we intervene for people who have a prescription drug use issue so that we are preventing them from transitioning to heroin use. But we know that the current increase in heroin use in the United States has been driven by prescription drug misuse.\n\n\u2026 So why aren\u2019t doctors being trained effectively to recognize the problem?\n\nMany states have already passed state legislation to require some minimal level of continuing medical education. Part of our strategy is continuing to push for federal legislation. \u2026\n\nWhat\u2019s the resistance?\n\n\u2026 We\u2019ve seen significant pushback from the medical community in terms of what they see as another government mandate. My position, however, is we\u2019re in the middle of an epidemic, and requiring a physician to have some level of minimal medical education on safe and opioid prescribing is not an undue burden when we have 120 people dying every single day of a drug-related overdose \u2014 and many of those are on prescription pain medication.\n\nWhat position have the pharmaceutical companies taken?\n\nI think the pharmaceutical companies have been helpful in terms of understanding our need for enhanced medical education. Actually, many pharmaceutical companies are now required by the FDA to provide what\u2019s called risk-mitigation strategies and training for prescribers whose pharmaceuticals are being used particularly for chronic long-term therapy.\n\n\u201cNo one\u2019s arguing that we don\u2019t need to adequately treat pain in the United States, but our understanding and monitoring of people who are on these medications, who went on to develop significant prescription drug disorders, has been startling and shocking.\u201d\n\n\u2026 We\u2019ve been looking at various drug treatment programs out there, and there\u2019s some interesting experimentation going on. Talk a little bit about what you think is working and where we\u2019re going, especially when it gets to programs like the Law Enforcement Assisted Diversion. We\u2019re looking at some heroin addicts and their involvement with LEAD.\n\n\u2026 For many, many years we\u2019ve seen the explosion of drug courts in the United States, which I think are a really good model. But I think what we\u2019re interested in is this continued evolution, quite honestly, of street-based diversion opportunities that we see.\n\nI think LEAD seems to be a promising program. We\u2019re continu[ing] to look at the evaluation of LEAD program to make sure that we have the best scientific understanding of the efficacy of that program.\n\nThe other piece that I think is really remarkable is, as I\u2019ve talked to law enforcement folks across the country, that they are taking it upon themselves to establish relationships with treatment programs and moving people toward care and treatment.\n\nI\u2019ve talked to the police chief in Gloucester, Mass., who really did a remarkable thing when he said that anybody in Gloucester, Mass., who needed care and treatment could walk into the police station, and the police would find a treatment program for them and would actually help support them through the duration of their early recovery program. I\u2019m tremendously heartened by the broad-scale understanding that police can play a huge role in terms of street-level diversion tactics. So our office is continually interested in effective and evaluated programs that can demonstrate diversion opportunities and set people on a path to recovery.\n\nThe critics would say that we\u2019re taking the stick away from the police, we\u2019re taking the stick away from society, and we\u2019re enabling people to go into treatment programs without any real disincentive to stop using.\n\nWe\u2019ve tried that approach. We\u2019ve tried the punitive approaches before, and we\u2019ve seen that that hasn\u2019t been successful. What we have seen as successful are opportunities to divert people to care and treatment.\n\nIf you have some level of accountability, whether it\u2019s to a police officer or to a court, we know that that can be a powerful motivator in not only getting people into care, but keeping them in care.\n\nRecently in the Boston Globe, two former drug czars called for the return of the war on drugs. Your reaction?\n\nI was actually quite shocked to see that. Again, I think there is a growing understanding within our administration and within the broader world that we\u2019ve been down that path before.\n\nApparently they didn\u2019t get the message.\n\nWell, at least I have the message. We have the message that we\u2019ve been down that road before and that it doesn\u2019t work. \u2026\n\nSo how do you see the role of your office going forward?\n\nWe\u2019re going to continue to pursue an agenda that supports prevention, treatment, recovery, support; continue to look at reforming our criminal justice system. Diverting people away from the criminal justice system and making sure that people have good care and treatment is one of the singularly [most] important things that we have to do.\n\nClearly, our work focusing on the opioid epidemic has focused our time and energy, so we will continue to pursue a reform agenda that supports greater therapeutic responses to substance use and its consequences rather than punitive response.\n\nShould we expect then, in the future, that you will spend less money on interdiction and law enforcement than you\u2019re spending on treatment? I mean, right now you\u2019re still spending more money on the old drug-war tactics.\n\nI think you\u2019ll continue to see and as proposed in the president\u2019s FY16 budget a continued emphasis to increase spending on prevention, treatment and recovery. Again, our spending on those areas are at its historical levels. \u2026", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "FRONTLINE", "description": "Tough-on-crime policies failed to end to the war on drugs.
