Although the relationship was weaker and less precise among women, the authors believe that the findings provide strong evidence in favor of medical cannabis. \u201cThe negative relationship between legalization and suicides among young men is consistent with the hypothesis that marijuana can be used to cope with stressful life events,\u201d they wrote.\n\nTo investigate, the team looked at suicide rates per 100,000 people in a set of states allowing medical marijuana as well as a group of control states in which the drug is still illegal. Using data from the National Vital Statistics System\u2019s Mortality Detail Files, they were able to graph a six-year trend beginning three years before the law change and ending three years after.\n\nThe researchers found that, in the years leading up to the new law, the male suicide trend was largely the same across all surveyed states. But as soon as medical marijuana was introduced, state trends began to diverge, with legalizing states recording a drop and non-legalizing states recording a surge. On average, states that legalized the medicinal use of the drug cut the male suicide rate from 27.2 per 100,000 men to 23.5 in the three years following the law change.\n\n\u201cOpponents of legalizing medical marijuana point to the large number of studies showing that marijuana use is positively associated with depression, the onset of panic attacks, psychosis, schizophrenia, and suicidal ideation,\u201d the authors explained. \u201cHowever, the association between marijuana use and outcomes such as these could be attributable to dif\ufb01cult-to-measure confounders such as personality.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Mayo Clinic, there is \u201cgood scientific evidence\u201d that the medical marijuana can be used as palliative treatment for multiple sclerosis and other conditions involving chronic nerve and muscle pain. That said, success stories from patients suggest that the drug can help alleviate an even broader range of symptoms, including seizures associated with epilepsy. One example is Charlotte Figi, a 6-year-old with epilepsy whose life was transformed by a course of low-THC cannabis oil.\n\nSource: Anderson M, Rees DI, Sabia J.
