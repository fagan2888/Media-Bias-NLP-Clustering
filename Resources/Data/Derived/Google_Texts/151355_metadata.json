Burwell. Many of these briefs make naked political appeals, urging the Court to uphold the contested IRS rule lest it risk disrupting insurance markets, undermining the operations of the PPACA, or forcing the political branches to act. Some of the government-side amicus briefs make serious legal arguments, however, including several briefs written by or on behalf of legal academics.\n\nOne such amicus brief was filed on behalf of a prominent list of legal academics who focus on questions of statutory interpretation and administrative law: William Eskridge, John Ferejohn, Charles Fried, Lisa Marshall Manheim, and David Strauss. This brief purports to make the textualist argument in support of the government\u2019s position, and some of the brief\u2019s signatories are noted experts in the field. Prof. Eskridge, for instance, is easily one of the most important scholars of statutory interpretation writing today. Everything he writes is worth a read. Accordingly, a brief bearing his name merits a close and careful look.\n\nThe brief begins with an extensive discussion of the principles of statutory interpretation and, in particular, the requirements of textualism. Although the most prominent names on the briefs are critics of textualist approaches to statutory interpretation, they recognize that textualism holds greater sway in the courts generally, and at One First Street in particular, than it might in the academy. They craft their arguments accordingly.\n\n\u201cTextualism does not require courts to read statutory provisions in a vacuum,\u201d the amici declare. They\u2019re right, of course, but no one is suggesting otherwise. To quote Justice Elena Kagan, \u201cI agree with [the academic amici] (really, who does not?) that context matters in interpreting statutes.\u201d Yet as I\u2019ve demonstrated at length before, context does not save the government\u2019s case, nor does it justify reading discrete phrases to mean their opposite. Such statements in a brief like this are nothing more than throat clearing. They do no real work.\n\nThe academic amici cite many of the relevant cases on statutory interpretation. For instance, they properly cite the Court\u2019s opinion from last term in Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA, to the effect that \u201creasonable statutory interpretation must account for both \u2018the specific context in which . .. .language is used\u2019 and \u2018the broader context of the statute as a whole.\u2019\u201d Again, who disagrees? But that\u2019s not all there is to the UARG opinion, however. What the amici neglect to mention is that the same opinion went on to \u201creaffirm the core administrative-law principle that an agency may not rewrite clear statutory terms to suit its own sense of how the statute should operate.\u201d Perhaps this language is not quoted because it creates a problem for the amici\u2019s argument. It is one thing to rely upon context to conclude that the phrase \u201ctangible object\u201d is limited to business-related documents and records \u2013 to the exclusion of fish \u2013 quite another to argue that it means gaseous substances or ethereal vapors; quite another to say that \u201cestablished by the State\u201d means established by the federal government.\n\nThe heart of the brief is an analysis of the relevant statutory provisions of the PPACA \u2013 or, I should say, some of the relevant provisions. For all the brief\u2019s talk about the need to consider context and not to take words or phrases in isolation, it ignores key provisions and grossly misinterprets others.\n\nThe brief claims that \u201cthe ACA\u2019s definitional provisions show that all exchanges established \u2018under section 1311\u2019 are \u201cExchange[s] established by the State\u201d for purposes of the Act.\u201d In support of this claim, the brief first cites the definition for \u201cExchange\u201d provided in Section 1563: \u201can American Health Benefit Exchange established under section 1311 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.\u201d So far so good, but this only provides a default definition for an exchange as a \u201cSection 1311 exchange,\u201d and says nothing about whether it was established by a state or the federal government. Moreover, Section 1551 of the PPACA expressly provides that this definition is only a default; it applies \u201cunless specifically provided for otherwise.\u201d In other words, an \u201cExchange\u201d need not be a Section 1311 exchange where text and context so indicate. Yet this qualification is nowhere cited in the brief, nor are its implications ever considered.\n\nThe Section 1563 definition establishes that, as a general rule, exchanges under the PPACA are assumed to be Section 1311 exchanges. The issue is whether such exchanges, when established by the federal government, can be said to be \u201cestablished by the State.\u201d To substantiate this link in their argument, the brief claims that \u201csection 1311 provides that \u2018[a]n Exchange shall be a governmental agency or nonprofit entity that is established by a State.\u2019\u201d According to the brief, this is one of the statute\u2019s \u201cdefinitional provisions\u201d that shows that \u201cthe phrase \u2018Exchange established by the State under section 1311\u2032 is a term of art.\u201d If only that were so.\n\nThe \u201cdefinitional provision\u201d amici cite is nothing of the kind, as text and context make abundantly clear. The specific provision relied upon by the amici is written and expressly labeled as a \u201crequirement\u201d of exchanges created under Section 1311, not as a definition, and \u2013when read in context \u2013 clearly operates as such. The provision cited is Section 1311(d)(1). Here it is:\n\n(d) REQUIREMENTS.\u2014\n\n(1) IN GENERAL.\u2014An Exchange shall be a governmental agency or nonprofit entity that is established by a State.\n\nThis provision imposes a requirement on states that qualifying exchanges be governmental or nonprofit entities. It operates to preclude a state handing over its exchange to a for-profit entity. It does not \u2013 indeed, cannot be read \u2013 as defining all exchanges as \u201ca governmental agency or nonprofit entity that is established by a State\u201d without completely obliterating the that function. Indeed, read as the amici suggest, it would allow a state-endorsed exchange created and operated by Amazon to qualify as a \u201cnonprofit entity that is established by the State.\u201d And the amici accuse others of ripping provisions out of their context?\n\nIt gets worse. For while the amici are conjuring up definitions that Congress did not provide, they are also ignoring relevant statutory definitions that Congress did provide. Most significantly, the brief makes no mention whatsoever of the PPACA\u2019s definition of \u201cState.\u201d Section 1304 provides that \u201cthe term \u2018State\u2019 means each of the 50 States and the District of Columbia.\u201d Congress could have defined \u201cState\u201d to include the federal government, but it did not. Nor did it adopt equivalence language of the sort contained in the House bill or which was adopted concerning federal territories.\n\nGiven that the key question is what, if anything, Congress meant by an exchange \u201cestablished by the State,\u201d one might think the definition of \u201cState\u201d would be relevant. After all, we\u2019re supposed to look at the whole text. Yet it is never mentioned in the brief. In a footnote the amici write: \u201cPetitioners are not free to ignore Congress\u2019s definition just because it\u2019s not the definition that they would give to the same term.\u201d It seems they should have heeded their own advice.\n\nThe brief also repeatedly miscites one of the relevant provisions, referring to Section 1321 of the PPACA as 1322. I expect this is just a typo, and lord knows I\u2019ve made plenty of those over the years. But perhaps it is indicative of the care with which the brief\u2019s authors examined the relevant text or the degree of familiarity the amici have with the statute. For just as any member of Congress who read the PPACA prior to passage would have understood the plain meaning of \u201cexchange established by the State under Section 1311,\u201d anyone who has truly focused on the PPACA provisions at issue in King would know it is Section 1321 that tells the federal government to \u201cestablish\u201d exchanges \u201cwithin the state,\u201d and not Section 1322.\n\nWhen the brief turns to its discussion of interpretive canons, it makes another conspicuous omission. As noted in the treatise, Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts by Antonin Scalia and Bryan Garner (which the amici cite on four separate occasions in their brief), courts are to interpret statutes so as to give effect to every word used by Congress: \u201cIf possible, every word and every provision is to be given effect. . . . None should be ignored. None should needlessly be given an interpretation that causes it to duplicate another provision or to have no consequence.\u201d (Scalia & Garner at p. 174). Yet that is precisely the effect that the academic amici\u2019s interpretation would have for the phrase \u201cestablished by the State.\u201d\n\nNor can petitioners account make sense of what we know of the drafting history of the relevant provisions, including the fact that the phrase \u201cestablished by the State\u201d was added in multiple places at multiple times during the drafting process. Under their interpretation, such additions were pointless and serve no purpose whatsoever.\n\nI could go on \u2014 noting the briefs strained reading of other provisions and failure to note (let alone address) the various anomalies throughout the PPACA their interpretation would create \u2014 but I have other things to do, and I think I\u2019ve made my point.\n\nAs should be clear by now, I was quite underwhelmed by this brief. When I saw the list of signatories, I expected something more compelling. The arguments put forth in the brief are likely convincing to those who are not particularly familiar with the relevant statutory provisions and arguments. For those immersed in the case, on the other hand, the brief\u2019s shortcomings are quite plain.\n\nPerhaps I should not have been surprised. After all, while the brief purports to make a \u201ctextualist\u201d argument, the most notable names on the brief are outspoken critics of textualism, not adherents. The various sorts of statutory interpretation advanced by Prof. Eskridge, for example, would undoubtedly offer more support to the government\u2019s position than does a more sober and restrained textualist analysis. The only problem is that the current Court has not adopted Prof. Eskridge\u2019s theories, which is why the brief is styled in textualist trappings.\n\nSupporters of the government\u2019s position would like the Court to believe that traditional textualist analysis can be used to support the government\u2019s position. Those who make such claims are mistaken, as the deficiencies of this brief make abundantly clear. According to the academic amici, King is \u201ca case about good textual analysis vs. bad textual analysis.\u201d Precisely, and their brief proves the point.\n\n[Note: Updated to fix a typo of my own.
